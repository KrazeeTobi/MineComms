Who benefits from ads?

Me as a developer? Kinda. Assuming the equation I mentioned in the last blog about the ads works out as positive, there&amp;#8217;s an economic incentive to run ads.
But I&amp;#8217;m encouraging users to pay for other games, when I would rather have them pay for my game, which is the reason they come there in the first place.

The players? No. Definitely not. The web site gets more cluttered, and there&amp;#8217;s a potential drop in performance in the game.
There&amp;#8217;s some small benefit in finding out about similar services you might like more, but I don&amp;#8217;t think that&amp;#8217;s very common.

The people running the ads? Absolutely! The reason they run ads at all is to increase their income. You get your name out there, people get used to it, and traffic increases.

So if it&amp;#8217;s not got for you, only kinda good for me, and definitely good for scum like Evony, why do I have ads?

The answer is, I no longer do. And I never[*] will again.

(Side notes: I was against ads from the very beginning. I ran this as an experiment, and it failed. I will DEFINITELY, however, run ads for Minecraft on other sites when the game is done. ;D Oh, and sorry about the evony crap.)

[* May or may not be true.]


[b]There&#39;s a lot of work to be done for crafting![/b]

I&amp;#8217;m trying an item assembly based approach to crafting. You&amp;#8217;ll have a 3x3 tile grid of item slots. Putting the right combination of items in there turns them into a new item.

For example, this would become a pickaxe:

XXX   X = Iron ingot
.#.   # = Wood
.#.   . = Nothing

And this would be a sword:

.X.   X = Iron ingot
.X.   # = Wood
.#.   . = Nothing

And an iron block: (The actual positioning within the grid is irrelevant)

XX.   X = Iron ingot
XX.   # = Wood
...   . = Nothing

To do the crafting, you need access to a crafting table. All crafting is immediate, so you can craft as fast as you can click.

Other things I&amp;#8217;m considering is REQUIRING a pick-axe to mine stone, but you can make one for free out of wood. It won&amp;#8217;t last long, but it&amp;#8217;ll get you started. Then you can make a stone pick-axe.
To mine iron, a stone or better pick-axe is required.
To mine gold or emerald, you need an iron pick-axe.
This ensures you can&amp;#8217;t get an emerald pick-axe immediately because of a lucky spawn.

[b]Phew, got the inventory cleaned up[/b]

I reworked how the clicking around in the inventory works, and cleaned up the code a whole lot.

There&amp;#8217;s a new interim update up on indev now if you want to try it (and voxel sprites) out. &amp;#8216;b&amp;#8217; is hardcoded to open a crafting menu there as well, but that&amp;#8217;s just temporary.

Oh, and ignore the weird graphical glitch when it first starts. Just click it to make it behave. =)

The players? No. Definitely not. The web site gets more cluttered, and there&amp;#8217;s a potential drop in performance in the game.
There&amp;#8217;s some small benefit in finding out about similar services you might like more, but I don&amp;#8217;t think that&amp;#8217;s very common.

The people running the ads? Absolutely! The reason they run ads at all is to increase their income. You get your name out there, people get used to it, and traffic increases.

So if it&amp;#8217;s not got for you, only kinda good for me, and definitely good for scum like Evony, why do I have ads?

The answer is, I no longer do. And I never[*] will again.

(Side notes: I was against ads from the very beginning. I ran this as an experiment, and it failed. I will DEFINITELY, however, run ads for Minecraft on other sites when the game is done. ;D Oh, and sorry about the evony crap.)

[b]There&#39;s a lot of work to be done for crafting![/b]

I&amp;#8217;m trying an item assembly based approach to crafting. You&amp;#8217;ll have a 3x3 tile grid of item slots. Putting the right combination of items in there turns them into a new item.

For example, this would become a pickaxe:

XXX   X = Iron ingot
.#.   # = Wood
.#.   . = Nothing

And this would be a sword:

.X.   X = Iron ingot
.X.   # = Wood
.#.   . = Nothing

And an iron block: (The actual positioning within the grid is irrelevant)

XX.   X = Iron ingot
XX.   # = Wood
...   . = Nothing

To do the crafting, you need access to a crafting table. All crafting is immediate, so you can craft as fast as you can click.

Other things I&amp;#8217;m considering is REQUIRING a pick-axe to mine stone, but you can make one for free out of wood. It won&amp;#8217;t last long, but it&amp;#8217;ll get you started. Then you can make a stone pick-axe.
To mine iron, a stone or better pick-axe is required.
To mine gold or emerald, you need an iron pick-axe.
This ensures you can&amp;#8217;t get an emerald pick-axe immediately because of a lucky spawn.

[b]Phew, got the inventory cleaned up[/b]

I reworked how the clicking around in the inventory works, and cleaned up the code a whole lot.

There&amp;#8217;s a new interim update up on indev now if you want to try it (and voxel sprites) out. &amp;#8216;b&amp;#8217; is hardcoded to open a crafting menu there as well, but that&amp;#8217;s just temporary.

Oh, and ignore the weird graphical glitch when it first starts. Just click it to make it behave. =)

You&#39;re better off making a draining pit. Unless it&#39;s the ocean, In which you would need sponges to contain the forming puddle.

I DO like the fact that water and lava flows downward now. It was annoying when a single block of un-sponged water could flood an entire underground complex at-level.

This will make my water bases much nicer, now that I don&#39;t have to hide sponges to control water flow... I THINK.[/QUOTE]

You&#39;re better off making a draining pit. Unless it&#39;s the ocean, In which you would need sponges to contain the forming puddle.

(Ocean has unlimited water around the edges.)</span>

Nope, you won&#39;t. As long as lava or water can find a way down, it will. Both are [b]completely finite[/b] so you don&#39;t have to worry about floods. You still can&#39;t make waterfalls though :(

And beware, water evaporates, and lava turns to stone when one of its sides is exposed."

One of the hallways with lava lighting. At the end of the hallway and to the right is where I found...
[img]http://filesmelt.com/dl/1notch6.png[/img]

This massive cavern. Orriginally there were small empty pools on the floor, however I built a magma pipe system and used it to fill the pools, which lit up the cavern.
[img]http://filesmelt.com/dl/1notch7.png[/img]

This is my favorite spot, it&#39;s right behind the huge rock column at the far side of the cavern. I think it&#39;s neat the map generator actually created the column like that.
[img]http://filesmelt.com/dl/1notch8.png[/img]

A channel I had dug to light up more of the cavern, there&#39;s way more to the cavern at the other side of the channel, which is why I stopped the flow so I could explore it before flooding it with lava.
[img]http://filesmelt.com/dl/1notch9.png[/img]

That&#39;s a hollow passage that I explored and nearly got lost in. The cavern is HUGE and there are a few pools of water and more magma back there as well.

A few things I learned about magma is that:
1.Magma is a GREAT tool for lighting
2.However as you drain it, you&#39;re going to eventually run out. I did and had to use magma spawn blocks to keep the supply going.
3.For reasons like this, magma could become a commodity in survival mode, there&#39;s only a limited amount and it has many uses.
4.If magma supplies get low and the lava can&#39;t fill the area it&#39;s on, it will start solidifying. Meaning that you have to go back and remove the solidified magma chunks from your magma pipes. Which is a pain.
5.Because of that, I would plan on creating primary magma pipes 2 high. It makes it easier to clean and lowers the chance of total clogging.

Why dumbs? I have a very nice server with an autoupdating isocraft map, but I&#39;m very busy lately, and don&#39;t have time for this. I&#39;ll be taking care of it again when beta&#39;s out, though. Too much to take care of right now.</span>
