it started me at the bottom, front door floating in front of oblivion.

It was a bitch to climb... and before you say I flew (because I look like I&#39;m floating), I built a bridge out of stones and deleted them as I went so you could see the screen better.

but... if I ever hosted my own server with the final release, I&#39;d do this. It&#39;s really cool, and I bet a few players could turn it into something wicked-awesome.

the lava is from a small cave I was GOING to hollow out and try Rubs&#39;s lighting method, but in my overzealous fast digging I went straight for making a cascading lava flow, and it backfired, filled the cave, and I barely managed to open up the wall and get to high ground before it got to me. the lava then continued down the spiral staircase I burrowed up the inside of the mountain with, I guess... and... yeah."

I hate to say it guys, but the server has been griefed again, Turbine, the blimp, and many sprites have been hit hard, and the vennobaun and mine have been flooded, not sure what else has been hit as of yet.

the game now contains 59 block types, 34 item types, and 36 recipes for crafting. More’s coming!

You can make food now by making a wooden bowl and mixing some mushrooms into it.

You can make arrows, and bows, and tnt, and workbenches, and chests. And golden weapons, if you want to. Oh, and the gemstone formerly known as “emerald” is now “diamond” because it makes more sense.

Thanks for all the feedback. I’m pretty sure i’m sticking to this style of crafting. I will make it more ingame if i can so you don’t spend all the time in the inventory.[/quote]
