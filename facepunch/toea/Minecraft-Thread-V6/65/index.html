[B]February 11, 3:06 PM[/B]

Today is the first day of my expedition. I plan on recording my thoughts and experiences in this journal. Some claimed that I was bringing it because I knew I was going to die here, but phooey. My helicopter is out of fuel, of course, but I&#39;m sure there is oil somewhere inside these so called &quot;Floating Islands&quot;.

A little background, for those of you that don&#39;t know of them. About three weeks ago, these islands rose out of the ocean and began to float above the sea, right over the Bermuda Triangle. Convenient, is it not? As always, nobody dared make the trip there, or even the trip to the area surrounding it, given the nature of the Triangle. Some claimed it was Atlantis. Some thought it was the isle of Satan. Either way, I assume I will find out.The fog was quite thick, but I experienced no malfunction in my technology as the stories always go. The islands are fairly vast, it will probably take a few weeks to get to the other side of the pass, not counting any bridge-making I will have to do, as I am sure I will.

It is today, that I, the famous British explorer, Jack Davis, begin my journey. I&#39;m sure this notebook will be of assistance.

Today, I awoke at 6 AM sharp, so that I could begin bright and early. The fog was a little thick, but I could see the sun through the clouds, so all was well. I&#39;ve encountered sheep and even pigs in the surrounding area, which is quite strange. No birds, however. I swear I can hear them, though it may be just my imagination acting up. I didn&#39;t do much throughout the day, mostly gathering supplies and chopping trees. The rings on the inside show that the trees are nigh thousands of years old, remarkably. I collected some wood and intend to build my base a little bit higher up, to get a better view. I&#39;m hoping the fog won&#39;t impede my progress.

As I settled into bed for the night last night, I swore I could hear the strangest of groaning. As with the birds, I&#39;m positive it was my imagination. I will keep the diary updated tomorrow with my findings.

[B]February 11, 3:06 PM[/B]

Today is the first day of my expedition. I plan on recording my thoughts and experiences in this journal. Some claimed that I was bringing it because I knew I was going to die here, but phooey. My helicopter is out of fuel, of course, but I&#39;m sure there is oil somewhere inside these so called &quot;Floating Islands&quot;.

A little background, for those of you that don&#39;t know of them. About three weeks ago, these islands rose out of the ocean and began to float above the sea, right over the Bermuda Triangle. Convenient, is it not? As always, nobody dared make the trip there, or even the trip to the area surrounding it, given the nature of the Triangle. Some claimed it was Atlantis. Some thought it was the isle of Satan. Either way, I assume I will find out.The fog was quite thick, but I experienced no malfunction in my technology as the stories always go. The islands are fairly vast, it will probably take a few weeks to get to the other side of the pass, not counting any bridge-making I will have to do, as I am sure I will.

It is today, that I, the famous British explorer, Jack Davis, begin my journey. I&#39;m sure this notebook will be of assistance.

Today, I awoke at 6 AM sharp, so that I could begin bright and early. The fog was a little thick, but I could see the sun through the clouds, so all was well. I&#39;ve encountered sheep and even pigs in the surrounding area, which is quite strange. No birds, however. I swear I can hear them, though it may be just my imagination acting up. I didn&#39;t do much throughout the day, mostly gathering supplies and chopping trees. The rings on the inside show that the trees are nigh thousands of years old, remarkably. I collected some wood and intend to build my base a little bit higher up, to get a better view. I&#39;m hoping the fog won&#39;t impede my progress.

As I settled into bed for the night last night, I swore I could hear the strangest of groaning. As with the birds, I&#39;m positive it was my imagination. I will keep the diary updated tomorrow with my findings.

Horrifyingly disfigured. You should find a doctor.

I have just chased a sheep out of my abode. I could have sworn I shut the door and even locked it, but it&#39;s apparently openable. I awoke to a sheep staring me in the face and bleating bloody murder at me. Well, I suppose it wasn&#39;t technically staring [i]at[/i] me, as it was mostly staring at the areas to the left and right of me. Their eyes go in different directions, you see. Getting it out of my house was no easy task as well, mind you, as the thing was half my size. Much larger than any sheep I&#39;d seen before. The sheep on this island appear much smarter than other sheep despite their appearance. I saw three sheep shoving a pig off of the edge of the island earlier, and apparently they have a sort of hierarchy going on amongst them, ranking by size and wool color. Darker means more freedom, apparently.

As I shooed it out the door, I noticed a strange shadowy figure on the horizon. It looked vaguely humanlike, so I decided to investigate, but as I approached, it quickly dashed into a nearby cave, and the sheep quickly followed. I&#39;ll look into this in the morning. I&#39;ve made ten or so torches, but I&#39;m afraid of lighting them as I&#39;m not sure how quickly the wood on these islands will burn.

I reinforced the door by moving a chest in front of it. Hopefully I will find a better solution tomorrow.
