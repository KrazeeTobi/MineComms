I mean, it&#39;s not like any construction will ever last forever (other than in screenshot form) since everything eventually gets griefed or the server changes map. It would be so much more interesting if people could [i]accept[/i] the ephemeral nature of constructions in Minecraft and allow others to freely expand upon and modify their buildings.

As it is now, everyone builds things and then just jealously guards them - even though they aren&#39;t &quot;using them&quot; in any way anymore. What&#39;s the point? They&#39;re all just sculptures of a sort anyway. Take a few screenshots and then let it go."

Was such a dick move.</span>

Griefing != modifying. Read my server rules. People can destroy/modify/claim other&#39;s buildings if given permission from an Admin.
