For a grammar Nazi, you make a lot of mistakes.

At any rate, arguments are better taken to PMs. If you insist on dragging a argument on, might be good to suggest some things to do better. From what I&#39;ve seen reviewmad, I suggest you kick first, respect others opinions, and listen to complaints, as they wouldn&#39;t be complaints unless there was something to complain about. Banning right off the bat never helps, as it leaves a grudge. Respecting others allows you to be respected yourself. Right now, several pages of this thread are filled with complaints about you. That doesn&#39;t really allow many to respect you."
