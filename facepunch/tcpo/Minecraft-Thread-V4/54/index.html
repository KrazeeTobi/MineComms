I don&#39;t see any other rule than &quot;Don&#39;t Grief&quot; on your server, I don&#39;t see you supporting your server every day; as a matter of fact, I remember clearly that you proclaimed that you did not want to have anything to do within your server. You have OP&#39;s who constantly go rogue, damaging your server and yet you continue to add more and more OP&#39;s. And the comment that the only griefing done is by me is absolutely null, mostly because I have been banned for months and your players are complaining daily about griefing. Your server is in constant chaos; definately not a great server to play on.

And this is a low I thought you could never fall to, bringing back your server just to spite me and damage the player base of the other server; I think you need to acquire some morality."

I&#39;m sorry, but I just don&#39;t think it was a coincidence that in a time span of 10 minutes he has done the following things:

Venn joined Server, saw me.
Venn pleaded with Shad to ban me ASAP.
Shad refused.
Venn got pissy, and said Shad was too forgiving.
Venn put up his server in an effort to ruin Shad&#39;s server just because I won&#39;t be banned there."

It&#39;s not so much that you won&#39;t be banned there, as it is that I finally realized what the people who like my server meant by &quot;missing the dictatorial rule&quot; of it.

First, there are only 2 servers up right now; Shad&#39;s and Venns (with the exception of Review&#39;s which I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s up). And I won&#39;t be banned on Shad&#39;s, and I am already banned on Venns. Second, I can&#39;t accept what? I am merely trying to enlighten the Facepunch Minecrafters with the truth, not with the baseless lies Venn likes to spout while enraged; while at the same time offering the opportunity of playing on a server far above the level of Venn&#39;s."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=DemunGard;17542041]motion to IP ban deepneau on every facepunch server because he&#39;s a fucking retard and cant accept it

edit: and possibly SBII Gunz because he thinks deepneau is worth defending[/QUOTE]

First, there are only 2 servers up right now; Shad&#39;s and Venns (with the exception of Review&#39;s which I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s up). And I won&#39;t be banned on Shad&#39;s, and I am already banned on Venns. Second, I can&#39;t accept what? I am merely trying to enlighten the Facepunch Minecrafters with the truth, not with the baseless lies Venn likes to spout while enraged; while at the same time offering the opportunity of playing on a server far above the level of Venn&#39;s.</span>

Nilus has gone rogue for his share of times, along with a handful of other OP&#39;s, maybe you just need to keep your eyes open? Second, I am not angry at Venn because I am banned; the banning happened a long time ago and I frankly don&#39;t care about it anymore. My argument is that Venn, after saying that Shad&#39;s server is basically the same as his, and stating that he will let Shad&#39;s server stay up and he will be in charge of the future Minecraft Survival server, basically went completely back on his agreement just because he is mad that he did not get his way in Shad&#39;s server."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Amez;17542263]Griefing only happens at an occasion, if so it&#39;s over-exaggerated. I never saw any OP go rogue other than you. The server is never in constant chaos, hell sometimes I&#39;m wondering where the chaos is at. ITT: Deep&#39;s only argument is that he&#39;s angry at Venn because he banned him.[/QUOTE]

Nilus has gone rogue for his share of times, along with a handful of other OP&#39;s, maybe you just need to keep your eyes open? Second, I am not angry at Venn because I am banned; the banning happened a long time ago and I frankly don&#39;t care about it anymore. My argument is that Venn, after saying that Shad&#39;s server is basically the same as his, and stating that he will let Shad&#39;s server stay up and he will be in charge of the future Minecraft Survival server, basically went completely back on his agreement just because he is mad that he did not get his way in Shad&#39;s server.</span>
