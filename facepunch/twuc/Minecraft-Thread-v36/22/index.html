Yes, it does. It makes emotional development (on average, of course) 30% slower than of a normal person.
And the fact that I couldn&#39;t focus on that server and wanted to do something which is fun but doesn&#39;t require focusing is actually indicating that it was most likely caused by ADHD and had nothing to do with my intelligence."

please, adhd is a mental problem that can cause you to lose attention quickly, and gain hyperactivity.

if you do not take medicine, it is also hard for you to do such a test, say alone finish it with almost all answers correct. If you can, you do not have adhd but autism.
