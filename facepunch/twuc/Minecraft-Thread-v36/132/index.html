Elecpat was granted builder status weeks ago when he helped make a city on water without using spawned items. Trust me if your town was significant enough to get builder status you would have. Not that &quot;builder&quot; even gives you anything but a shiny green name."

Holy crap. When I started helping you I had already builder status. Stop whining about inf blocks, half of the server has them.
And yes, ask hangover, I&#39;m against inf blocks once mobs are added. But until then I see no point on why not. You were all cool and everything until you realized I was a builder even thought I was a builder when I started helping you.

EDIT:
Oh, and have you even seen all I did and helped to do? I bet you haven&#39;t. And what fly hacks?"
