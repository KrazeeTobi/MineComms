From what I heard you were putting minecraft tracks down, despite being told not to cuz they lag the server. First two points gone, and theres no evidence. So what if he was walking near your structure? So was the other guy. So what if he had torches? So did you. and probably the other guy. Torches are pretty damn common dude."

Let me correct the result of your feeblemindedness.
I didn&#39;t grief his server.
I got banned for no reason.
I&#39;m pointing out that someone who stole things (and there&#39;s evidence of him/her doing so) didn&#39;t get banned but the person who did nothing wrong did.[/QUOTE]

From what I heard you were putting minecraft tracks down, despite being told not to cuz they lag the server. First two points gone, and theres no evidence. So what if he was walking near your structure? So was the other guy. So what if he had torches? So did you. and probably the other guy. Torches are pretty damn common dude.</span>

I and other people were allowed to do so by moderators. Walking with torches near a place where these torches are missing isn&#39;t common at all.

Yes, you did. You were in my city which is located in the outlands which is far away form the place you took the screenshots of. You, me and another person were the only players who were in that city, and you took a screenshots of yourself standing in that city holding torches right near the place where those torches are missing."

Probably because you&#39;re too stupid to understand them. Usually, people who suffer from mental retardation call what smart people are saying retarded, because they think it makes no sense while it&#39;s in fact a result of their mental retardation.

For example, mentally retarded people can say that US has never exported terrorism and call everyone who says so retarded, due to the fact that they can&#39;t figure out how it&#39;s even possible.

However, later classified documents confirming this are released which makes mentally retarded people even more confused."

Yes you were, I was there.  minecarts don&#39;t work.  And you best not complain here, Talk to the hangover, if he says your not getting back in, then thats the end of it.

Bottom line is, we can&#39;t do anything about it.

So shut up and leave this thread until you learn to stop whining over every little thing."
