it was on a cliffside, so it was in the shadow.[/QUOTE]

I think your problem is that you are writing it like you&#39;d tell your friends what happened. You need to be more descriptive and take more time writing about specific events. You are running through the story too fast and it makes it difficult and boring to read.

Also, it&#39;d help if you used your shift key and capitalized shit when it should be.

grammar could be fixed and sentence structure could be varied also."

it was on a cliffside, so it was in the shadow.[/QUOTE]

I think your problem is that you are writing it like you&#39;d tell your friends what happened. You need to be more descriptive and take more time writing about specific events. You are running through the story too fast and it makes it difficult and boring to read.

Also, it&#39;d help if you used your shift key and capitalized shit when it should be.

grammar could be fixed and sentence structure could be varied also.</span>

hmm.

this could be because this was kinda like my day in minecraft, so i do something, pause the game and type a part, continue my adventure and then type a little, so maybe i should write it, and then take a look at it, make spaces between it and add proper grammar, thank you.

if i look at it now it is boring indeed, and i should add spaces in between to be able to see where i was in the story."
