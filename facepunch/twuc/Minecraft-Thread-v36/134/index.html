You should be able to, walk right up to the tree and aim at it and hold down mouse1 and wait for it to break (progress is shown by the amount of cracks being built up). You can use your bare hands to break almost anything, but tools just make it a lot faster (and the higher quality the tool, the better. Wood tools don&#39;t do much and deteriorate quickly, diamond tools mine things almost instantaneously and take a looooooong time to deteriorate).
