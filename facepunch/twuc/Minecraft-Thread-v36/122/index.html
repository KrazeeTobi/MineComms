                        <postrender input=":siren: [B]i am about to crosspost a rant i made from the minecraft forum that you probably don&#39;t care about because it does not apply to you or FP in general[/B] :siren:

First off: You are not Notch. The moment you become Notch let me know and I&#39;ll stop ranting and let you code the game, but for now, you are not and will never be Notch. You cannot tell me or your friend or anyone what Notch is or is not going to do because you do not command him and, again, you aren&#39;t him. Notch does not live to serve you, and Notch is, as corny as it sounds, a real person with a real life and real responsibilities, one of those happens to be Minecraft.

Again, ONE of those responsibilities is Minecraft. Notch does other things with his time than code Minecraft, eat, and sleep. For example, a few months ago [i]he quit his very own job to work on Minecraft more[/i] because he believed it would pay off better in the long run, and it did. There was exactly one month without updates. No uproar, no rallying in the streets, no complaining, because Notch did something for the better and for the game, and the fans understood that.

Now that there has been a rather annoying influx of popularity recently, there are more and more people to please, and they are getting slowly more and more ungrateful. Every time Notch updates there are throes of threads complaining about how Notch did not put in X little detail or Y feature that you wanted him to and how this is what he should include in the next update and so on and so on. Notch does not cater to you. Just because he said he would try to update every Friday does not mean you are entitled to an update every Friday. It means he said he would try to get enough coding done to put something out there so people stay satisfied, and now that he has taken his business elsewhere for the moment, the fans, old and new alike, are getting restless and unnerved, and it is making me fairly angry.

There&#39;s also the irking fact that people always consider Notch to be &quot;taking a vacation&quot;  when he isn&#39;t coding Minecraft. For the past two weeks he&#39;s been going all over the world, most recently to Bellvue, Washington, to visit Valve HQ. He was not there solely on vacation, he was there to talk to the CEOs about his game because he was contacted about it. The real reason there have been no Seecret Friday Updates ooooOOOOOOooo is because they were unrealistic and an unhealthy workload on Notch to begin with and now that he has done a few people are hungry for more than he can provide, and now people are getting restless and unpleasable because Notch is actually doing things with the game (talking to business partners, enlisting new staff members) and has no time to code because he&#39;s busy bettering the state the game is in anyway.

And then, of course, there are always the people that defend their accusations, with things such as &quot;I paid 10 dollars for this game, I deserve to have what I want put in!&quot; Yes, well, so did [url=http://minecraft.net/stats.jsp]122572 other people[/url], and they aren&#39;t making any more of a ruckus than you are. And, the tried and true &quot;Notch is being lazy and I&#39;m not getting my money&#39;s worth!&quot; Notch is not being lazy, he&#39;s coding Minecraft at his own pace. There is no such thing as laziness when you&#39;ve got all the time in the world to do something. There was no promise of an update every Friday, and because of that it&#39;s spoiled the people who thought they knew a thing or two about an update schedule. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget &quot;I&#39;m losing interest in the game because of no updates.&quot; It&#39;s been almost 14 days since the last update. ALMOST. And yet, players think they are entitled to daily updates from Notch, who owes them everything they want because they paid ten dollars to play an in progress game on the internet.

So, in conclusion, I propose that everyone just stops griping and gets along because it&#39;s fairly annoying having people complain every five pages or so.

                            <span v-pre>:siren: [B]i am about to crosspost a rant i made from the minecraft forum that you probably don&#39;t care about because it does not apply to you or FP in general[/B] :siren:

First off: You are not Notch. The moment you become Notch let me know and I&#39;ll stop ranting and let you code the game, but for now, you are not and will never be Notch. You cannot tell me or your friend or anyone what Notch is or is not going to do because you do not command him and, again, you aren&#39;t him. Notch does not live to serve you, and Notch is, as corny as it sounds, a real person with a real life and real responsibilities, one of those happens to be Minecraft.

Again, ONE of those responsibilities is Minecraft. Notch does other things with his time than code Minecraft, eat, and sleep. For example, a few months ago [i]he quit his very own job to work on Minecraft more[/i] because he believed it would pay off better in the long run, and it did. There was exactly one month without updates. No uproar, no rallying in the streets, no complaining, because Notch did something for the better and for the game, and the fans understood that.

Now that there has been a rather annoying influx of popularity recently, there are more and more people to please, and they are getting slowly more and more ungrateful. Every time Notch updates there are throes of threads complaining about how Notch did not put in X little detail or Y feature that you wanted him to and how this is what he should include in the next update and so on and so on. Notch does not cater to you. Just because he said he would try to update every Friday does not mean you are entitled to an update every Friday. It means he said he would try to get enough coding done to put something out there so people stay satisfied, and now that he has taken his business elsewhere for the moment, the fans, old and new alike, are getting restless and unnerved, and it is making me fairly angry.

There&#39;s also the irking fact that people always consider Notch to be &quot;taking a vacation&quot;  when he isn&#39;t coding Minecraft. For the past two weeks he&#39;s been going all over the world, most recently to Bellvue, Washington, to visit Valve HQ. He was not there solely on vacation, he was there to talk to the CEOs about his game because he was contacted about it. The real reason there have been no Seecret Friday Updates ooooOOOOOOooo is because they were unrealistic and an unhealthy workload on Notch to begin with and now that he has done a few people are hungry for more than he can provide, and now people are getting restless and unpleasable because Notch is actually doing things with the game (talking to business partners, enlisting new staff members) and has no time to code because he&#39;s busy bettering the state the game is in anyway.

And then, of course, there are always the people that defend their accusations, with things such as &quot;I paid 10 dollars for this game, I deserve to have what I want put in!&quot; Yes, well, so did [url=http://minecraft.net/stats.jsp]122572 other people[/url], and they aren&#39;t making any more of a ruckus than you are. And, the tried and true &quot;Notch is being lazy and I&#39;m not getting my money&#39;s worth!&quot; Notch is not being lazy, he&#39;s coding Minecraft at his own pace. There is no such thing as laziness when you&#39;ve got all the time in the world to do something. There was no promise of an update every Friday, and because of that it&#39;s spoiled the people who thought they knew a thing or two about an update schedule. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget &quot;I&#39;m losing interest in the game because of no updates.&quot; It&#39;s been almost 14 days since the last update. ALMOST. And yet, players think they are entitled to daily updates from Notch, who owes them everything they want because they paid ten dollars to play an in progress game on the internet.

So, in conclusion, I propose that everyone just stops griping and gets along because it&#39;s fairly annoying having people complain every five pages or so.

I group of us started this town. The hangover was here too. It started when I went&#39; to build something off the distance, and someone wanted to help, he decided a city. It has a really nice beach, but I didn&#39;t want to start anything that would ruin the land until it got more noticed.

Currently we have a small church, two houses. I giant lava tube for lighting, and a natural hole, it&#39;s kinda neat, I use it as a waste bin. It&#39;s like sacrificing my old tools to the gods. And a public mine, which looks pretty cool, if you ask me. 

How do you get there? Well I for one set my home to the church, but people in the server keep asking to help, and the mods were just TP&#39;ing everyone, but that&#39;s not very reasonable, so just now. I took some excess cobblestone and made a path. 

A-Spawn.

B-Giant tree, cobblestone papyrus farm. Head in this direction from spawn. If you see the waterpath, you&#39;re going the right direction

C-My cobble mine. It&#39;s wood on the bottom and cobble on the top. Not hard to see. When you get here you&#39;ll notice a cobblestone line behind it. Follow that. Soon I&#39;m going to make fences so so you could just autowalk (I put my walk key to spacebar and set my mouse upsidedown my space bar) till you get there. but for now just walk.

                            <span v-pre>So I decided to make a stairway going down, and that way I could make branches off of that to mine.

Then I dug my stairs down. clearing one layer of block at a time, leaving one block each time to make the pattern.

What do I see after I mine the VERY last block?
