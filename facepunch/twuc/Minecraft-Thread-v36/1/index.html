[b]Notch&#39;s Plans![/b]
From his Brocraft Stream on July 14.
(Thanks to chezhead for the transcript!)
[code]
- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.
- Cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP!
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits!

[B]About:[/B]
Flatcraft is basically dropping all &#39;texture&#39; in Minecraft and making it solid, flat but stylish blocks. It&#39;s pretty easy to tell what each Block is so you shouldn&#39;t have a hard time. Everything from terrain to your pick axe, a piece of meat and Mobs have been re-skinned or re-textured to suit the style. Mobs are slightly differently skinned but Flat none the less. Hope you enjoy this :)

[b]What is Minecraft/What is Minecraft about?[/b]

&quot;Minecraft is an open world sandbox building, crafting, mining and farming simulator. Creative mode is a mode which allows players to build with infinite amounts of blocks and without the threat of monsters or the darkness of nightfall. Creative mode is one of the first releases of the game, is free to play, but lacks the added extras from the full game such as; Minecarts, animals, monsters, water physics, lava, tools, weapons, armour and more. 

The main minecraft game is all of the above, but instead of infinite blocks, the player must build up a supply of blocks, ores, weapons and tools by mining and crafting, whilst siulataneously building a base for protection from monsters. 

Come nightfall monsters will often try to attack the player, and the base, castle or fort the player has built; can help protect them, along with the weapons they&#39;ve crafted aswell. Players can undertake in huge mining excavations, underwater cities, towering lighthouses, bridges, viaducts, and thousands of different buildings, only limited by their own imagination. 

Certain ores used for crafting the best tools, weapons and armour are harder to find than others, and require deep excavation and mining; but with the added threat of monsters and creepy-crawlies lurking down in the core of the earth, finding diamonds, lava, gold or obsidian brings a risk and reward factor to the game.&quot; -Benf199105

[b]Why should I buy Minecraft?[/b]

Do you like adventure games? Do you like first person games? Do you like horror games? Do you like exploring and discovering new things? Do you like pixel games? Do you like voxels? Do you like dynamic water, lava, spawning, terrain? Do you like zombies? Do you like explosions? Do you like coop games? Do you like games that are dynamically different every time you start a new save? Do you like adventure games? Do you like action games? Do you like simulation games? Do you like games that allow you to be creative? Do you like games that offer crafting? Do you like updates that come out almost every 2 days? Do you like community based developers and games? If so, you will like minecraft. :buddy:

[b]Here&#39;s what you get:[/b]
You never have to pay again!
You get all future versions of the game, including all expansions and addons.
You help fund the development of Minecraft
Custom skins in multiplayer
Once you&#39;ve bought the game, it&#39;s yours. No DRM.
Survival mode!

[b]Planned expansions:[/b]
Zombie Siege
Build your defenses during the day, fend off the incoming masses during night.
Capture the Flag
Defend your base and flag against the enemy team while trying to steal their flag.
Various custom level mods
Want to import a doom map? How about playing in a random dungeon?
And more!
[b]Minecraft keeps randomly stuttering and freezing, and I can&#39;t respawn. How do I fix it?[/b]
Open your save&#39;s level.dat with NBTedit, and set the player&#39;s health to 20, and deathtime to 0.
[b]My workbench isn&#39;t making my crafting space bigger?[/b]
Deploy the workbench then right click on it.
[b]Where is my minecraft folder?[/b]
Windows 7/Vista - C:\Users\computername\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft

The AppData folder might be hidden.
[B]Minecraft crashes and I get an error. What do I do?[/B]
Have you tried uninstalling/re-installing java? Have you updated java?  Have you deleted minecraft.jar and ran the client to re-download it? Try  these before you ask in the thread.

If nobody knows, AND ONLY IF NOBODY KNOWS, have you e-mailed Notch?

[B]Minecraft doesn&#39;t have all the cool stuff I see in the screenshots,  like tools and bacon and creepers![/B]
You need to purchase the game to use these features. Once you have  bought the game, head on over to [URL]http://minecraft.net/game/[/URL] to play! Or  alternatively, download the client from [URL]http://minecraft.net/download.jsp[/URL]

[b]What are these creatures and what do they do?[/b]

[i]Creepers[/i] are the green things with four legs, they simply walk up do you and explode. They drop powder which can be used to make TNT along with sand.

[i]Skeletons[/i] are the walking bones you see, and they shoot arrows at you. Just strafe them and land a couple hits with your sword on them. They drop arrows.

[i]Spiders[/i] are the bane of every miner&#39;s existance. They jump really high and can usually outrun you. They are wide, however, so they have trouble getting through doorways. These drop string so you can make bows.

[i]Zombies[/i] are really not much of a threat, but can attack you from above and kill you. They drop feathers for whatever reason which are used to make arrows.

[i]Slime[/i] are the smallest mob when in baby form. Baby slimes don&#39;t grow in Peaceful mode, but in anything above, they can grow to be 5x5+ big. They&#39;re friendly in peaceful, but when above baby form they can attack.

[i]Pigs[/i] are friendly creatures which give you meat when you kill them, and if you find a sattle, you can &quot;ride&quot; them.

[i]Sheep[/i] are friendly and will drop wool/cloth, which is mostly useless.

[i]Cows[/i] drop leather when killed, and leather is used to make armor. They also double as musical instruments.

[i]Chickens[/i] drop eggs from time to time, and when killed, they sometimes drop feathers. They are the second smallest mob.

[b]Odd Tips:[/b]
+ Gold is just as weak as wood, use diamond instead!
+ Placing sand directly above lava turns it into lava!
+ The simplest way to make your tower monster proof, is to have an under water entrance.
+ Saves can be found in &quot;C:\Documents and  Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\.minecraft
+ To get water to flow how you want, put the spawn so it can only go in  one direction/the directions you want, then use blocks to guide the  water. You can then delete the blocks (but not the ones around the  spawn)
+ Don&#39;t have a sword? Use an Axe! Axes are the 2nd strongest weapon against mobs! Order: Strongest - Sword, Axe, Pickaxe, Shovel, Fists - Weakest
+ When fighting spiders, go in a door-sized gap or hole in the wall, if any. Because spiders are fat 2x1x2 creatures, they cannot get through small holes!
+ Sheep, pigs, and cows can get hurt when you try to herd them, but if you want to get them somewhere without hurting them, use snowballs!
+ Snowballs are actually quite useful when fighting enemies around lava, as you can go rapid fire on them and hit them into lava!
+ If you are complaining about a lack of iron, you havn&#39;t looked enough. Do down into a deep cave as far as you can with a couple pickaxes, [b]lots[/b] of torches, 30 or so logs, 3 pork/bread, and a sword or two. Just go down as far as you can and you&#39;ll soon have iron out your ears.
+ There&#39;s a certain set distance that diamond is down, so you have to be very close to the bottom of the map to have a chance of finding it!

[b]Notch&#39;s Plans![/b]
From his Brocraft Stream on July 14.
(Thanks to chezhead for the transcript!)
[code]
- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.
- Cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP!
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.

[B]About:[/B]
Flatcraft is basically dropping all &#39;texture&#39; in Minecraft and making it solid, flat but stylish blocks. It&#39;s pretty easy to tell what each Block is so you shouldn&#39;t have a hard time. Everything from terrain to your pick axe, a piece of meat and Mobs have been re-skinned or re-textured to suit the style. Mobs are slightly differently skinned but Flat none the less. Hope you enjoy this :)

[b]What is Minecraft/What is Minecraft about?[/b]

&quot;Minecraft is an open world sandbox building, crafting, mining and farming simulator. Creative mode is a mode which allows players to build with infinite amounts of blocks and without the threat of monsters or the darkness of nightfall. Creative mode is one of the first releases of the game, is free to play, but lacks the added extras from the full game such as; Minecarts, animals, monsters, water physics, lava, tools, weapons, armour and more. 

The main minecraft game is all of the above, but instead of infinite blocks, the player must build up a supply of blocks, ores, weapons and tools by mining and crafting, whilst siulataneously building a base for protection from monsters. 

Come nightfall monsters will often try to attack the player, and the base, castle or fort the player has built; can help protect them, along with the weapons they&#39;ve crafted aswell. Players can undertake in huge mining excavations, underwater cities, towering lighthouses, bridges, viaducts, and thousands of different buildings, only limited by their own imagination. 

Certain ores used for crafting the best tools, weapons and armour are harder to find than others, and require deep excavation and mining; but with the added threat of monsters and creepy-crawlies lurking down in the core of the earth, finding diamonds, lava, gold or obsidian brings a risk and reward factor to the game.&quot; -Benf199105

[b]Why should I buy Minecraft?[/b]

Do you like adventure games? Do you like first person games? Do you like horror games? Do you like exploring and discovering new things? Do you like pixel games? Do you like voxels? Do you like dynamic water, lava, spawning, terrain? Do you like zombies? Do you like explosions? Do you like coop games? Do you like games that are dynamically different every time you start a new save? Do you like adventure games? Do you like action games? Do you like simulation games? Do you like games that allow you to be creative? Do you like games that offer crafting? Do you like updates that come out almost every 2 days? Do you like community based developers and games? If so, you will like minecraft. :buddy:

[b]Here&#39;s what you get:[/b]
You never have to pay again!
You get all future versions of the game, including all expansions and addons.
You help fund the development of Minecraft
Custom skins in multiplayer
Once you&#39;ve bought the game, it&#39;s yours. No DRM.
Survival mode!

[b]Planned expansions:[/b]
Zombie Siege
Build your defenses during the day, fend off the incoming masses during night.
Capture the Flag
Defend your base and flag against the enemy team while trying to steal their flag.
Various custom level mods
Want to import a doom map? How about playing in a random dungeon?
And more!
[b]Minecraft keeps randomly stuttering and freezing, and I can&#39;t respawn. How do I fix it?[/b]
Open your save&#39;s level.dat with NBTedit, and set the player&#39;s health to 20, and deathtime to 0.
[b]My workbench isn&#39;t making my crafting space bigger?[/b]
Deploy the workbench then right click on it.
[b]Where is my minecraft folder?[/b]
Windows 7/Vista - C:\Users\computername\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft

The AppData folder might be hidden.
[B]Minecraft crashes and I get an error. What do I do?[/B]
Have you tried uninstalling/re-installing java? Have you updated java?  Have you deleted minecraft.jar and ran the client to re-download it? Try  these before you ask in the thread.

If nobody knows, AND ONLY IF NOBODY KNOWS, have you e-mailed Notch?

[B]Minecraft doesn&#39;t have all the cool stuff I see in the screenshots,  like tools and bacon and creepers![/B]
You need to purchase the game to use these features. Once you have  bought the game, head on over to [URL]http://minecraft.net/game/[/URL] to play! Or  alternatively, download the client from [URL]http://minecraft.net/download.jsp[/URL]

[b]What are these creatures and what do they do?[/b]

[i]Creepers[/i] are the green things with four legs, they simply walk up do you and explode. They drop powder which can be used to make TNT along with sand.

[i]Skeletons[/i] are the walking bones you see, and they shoot arrows at you. Just strafe them and land a couple hits with your sword on them. They drop arrows.

[i]Spiders[/i] are the bane of every miner&#39;s existance. They jump really high and can usually outrun you. They are wide, however, so they have trouble getting through doorways. These drop string so you can make bows.

[i]Zombies[/i] are really not much of a threat, but can attack you from above and kill you. They drop feathers for whatever reason which are used to make arrows.

[i]Slime[/i] are the smallest mob when in baby form. Baby slimes don&#39;t grow in Peaceful mode, but in anything above, they can grow to be 5x5+ big. They&#39;re friendly in peaceful, but when above baby form they can attack.

[i]Pigs[/i] are friendly creatures which give you meat when you kill them, and if you find a sattle, you can &quot;ride&quot; them.

[i]Sheep[/i] are friendly and will drop wool/cloth, which is mostly useless.

[i]Cows[/i] drop leather when killed, and leather is used to make armor. They also double as musical instruments.

[i]Chickens[/i] drop eggs from time to time, and when killed, they sometimes drop feathers. They are the second smallest mob.

[b]Odd Tips:[/b]
+ Gold is just as weak as wood, use diamond instead!
+ Placing sand directly above lava turns it into lava!
+ The simplest way to make your tower monster proof, is to have an under water entrance.
+ Saves can be found in &quot;C:\Documents and  Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\.minecraft
+ To get water to flow how you want, put the spawn so it can only go in  one direction/the directions you want, then use blocks to guide the  water. You can then delete the blocks (but not the ones around the  spawn)
+ Don&#39;t have a sword? Use an Axe! Axes are the 2nd strongest weapon against mobs! Order: Strongest - Sword, Axe, Pickaxe, Shovel, Fists - Weakest
+ When fighting spiders, go in a door-sized gap or hole in the wall, if any. Because spiders are fat 2x1x2 creatures, they cannot get through small holes!
+ Sheep, pigs, and cows can get hurt when you try to herd them, but if you want to get them somewhere without hurting them, use snowballs!
+ Snowballs are actually quite useful when fighting enemies around lava, as you can go rapid fire on them and hit them into lava!
+ If you are complaining about a lack of iron, you havn&#39;t looked enough. Do down into a deep cave as far as you can with a couple pickaxes, [b]lots[/b] of torches, 30 or so logs, 3 pork/bread, and a sword or two. Just go down as far as you can and you&#39;ll soon have iron out your ears.
+ There&#39;s a certain set distance that diamond is down, so you have to be very close to the bottom of the map to have a chance of finding it!

It&#39;s Like Teamspeak or Ventrillo, it allows you to talk to a group of people.

[b]How do I Download this amazing science?[/b]
Go here: [url]http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/files/Mumble/1.2.2/Mumble-1.2.2.exe/download[/url]

[b]How do I get into it?[/b]
Once you finish Downloading the Software and go through the introduction, click &quot;server&quot; on the tool bar, and then click on the &quot;connect&quot; button. Hit &quot;Add new...&quot; and type in this information: 
[code]Servername:The Mumbel

Username:(whatever you want your username to be)[/code]
And thats it! You should be all set to chat :D

Bananazorz is being a pretty Awesome guy and is lending his Mumble to my Minecraft server!

What is Mumble?
It&#39;s Like Teamspeak or Ventrillo, it allows you to talk to a group of people.

How do I Download this amazing science?
Go here: [url]http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumb...2.exe/download[/url]

How do I get into it?
Once you finish Downloading the Software and go through the introduction, click &quot;server&quot; on the tool bar, and then click on the &quot;connect&quot; button. Hit &quot;Add new...&quot; and type in this information:

Servername:The Mumbel
Address:viuhka.fi
Port:64718
Username:(whatever you want your username to be)

And thats it! You should be all set to chat :D

NOTICE:Do not use the &quot;Backwards compatible&quot; version it does not work with the server. [/quote]
