Well I was a little angry when I was working on the mine and he closed the door shut with obsidian. Then I came back from sleeping, and the whole mine had been infinite smoothstoned shut.

Yes. If you use a real working login, it&#39;s stored in the game files, so next time you log in with that account and it can&#39;t connect, you&#39;ll be given the option to play offline.

If your school has blocked saving or viewing appdata or other hidden folders, you won&#39;t be able to put in or get your world files when you&#39;re done, but at least it&#39;s something to do. :v:"
