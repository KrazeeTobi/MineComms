Not really. I have a bias simply because I am a blue member, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s that much of a big deal. It&#39;s not like a surprise party or the like, from what I&#39;ve heard, its just a picture.

There was a pretty awesome one but I&#39;m not entirely sure whether it&#39;s been updated for Beta.

                        <postrender input="Ideas time with ironman17 ahoy! This time we&#39;ve got some foodstuffs to see to.

First up, the Hamburger. To craft, simply combine 1 Bread with 1 Cooked Porkchop, and you get a stack of 4 Hamburgers, each healing 1.5 Hearts each, amounting to 6 Hearts per Craft. I am still debating whether or not to limit the stacks to 4, 8 or 16.

Secondly, there is the Bottle of Milk, which is made from crafting a Bucket of Milk with a block of Glass. This would yield 4 Bottles of Milk, and the Bucket is lost in the crafting, thus meaning that the Milk is now even more delicious and fortified with what Minecraft wants. What Minecraft DESERVES (if you get the ref, you rock). And by that, I mean it heals about 2 Hearts and also adds 1 Armour point (with Iron-grade durability) to your Armour bar (filling up a blank icon as well as adding an extra icon onto the end of the Armour bar) which persists until worn out by damage. Still debating over whether or not to let the Milk fortification bonus stack.

A new kind of apparatus that can be made by the player is the Chemistry Set (have I already talked about this?).  It&#39;s similar to the Furnace, only it is used to extract the juices from Plants and Food items. In order to make it work, simply put the desired item in the top square (the &quot;crushing&quot; square), and place an empty bucket in the bottom square. After a few seconds, the item will be gone, and the Bucket will become a Bucket of *insert name here*. For example, using a Cooked Porkchop on a Chemistry Set will yield a Bucket of Gravy, whilst a yellow Flower will yield a Bucket of Dandelion Extract. (Admit it, the yellow Flowers look like dandelions)

Different &quot;Extracts&quot; can be used for different purposes. For example, Gravy can be &quot;bottled&quot; when combined with Glass, and these Gravy Bottles can be thrown, and all enemies (except the Skeletons) within a certain distance will come running to the smell of delicious Gravy (ignoring you), and if the bottle hits a Mob, they will start attacking said Mob. Another example is that you can combine flower extracts with Slime to create Paint, which can be combined with a Paintbrush (1 Cloth/Feather, 1 Gold bar, 1 Stick = 1 Paintbrush) to create a *insert colour here* Paintbrush.

With the theoretical introduction of the Blue Flower (titled Cornflower), you can craft three colours; Red (from the Rose), Yellow (from the Dandelion), and Blue (from the Cornflower), the three key colours of the outdated RYB colour model, a predecessor to the more commonly-recognized RGB (for screen displays) and CYMK (for colour printing) colour models. Mixing two of the &quot;primary extracts&quot; yields other colours (Rose + Cornflower = Violet/Purple, Rose + Dandelion = Orange, Cornflower + Dandelion = Green), though these can only be created by combining them as Paint, whereas combining them whilst they are still extracts will yield something else entirely (if you have Glass handy to bottle them with). Milk can also be mixed with Slime to create White Paint, whereas Tar and Slime yields Black Paint. (I will cover Tar later in the Oil section)

As mentioned prior, combining Paint with a regular Paintbrush will yield a coloured Paintbrush, which can be used to paint the side of a block with the chosen colour when using the Right Mouse button, at which point that side of the block is painted, and the Paintbrush returns to normal, requiring another &quot;dipping&quot; (the Gold magically cleans the brush after you paint the side of a block). When crafted with a Paintbrush, a Paintbucket will lose a bit of &quot;durability&quot; instead of simply vanishing, as the paint is being used bit by bit every time you dip the brush in, and when the Paintbucket&#39;s durability reaches zero, all you have is a Bucket, since you used up all the paint in the Bucket. A way to counter this problem is the Golden Bucket, made in the same fashion as a Steel bucket, only it can hold more Paint for some reason, but apart from that isn&#39;t at all different from a normal Bucket, save for the fact that it can&#39;t hold Lava, for obvious reasons. Consider it both a fancy Bucket and a way to save on Steel.

Last item on the agenda: Oil. Oil is a brand new substance found primarily underground, a new liquid of many uses. It comes primarily in small pockets (2x2 blocks wide, 3 blocks high), although on rare double-rainbow occassions, you might find an underground lake of Oil. Similar to Lava, it flows slowly, and cannot be used to make an infinite spring like Water can, plus it can slow you down even more than if you were in Water. Like pretty much all liquids, it can be collected with a Bucket, and can be &quot;refined&quot; at a Chemistry Lab. To &quot;refine&quot; Oil, place the Oil Bucket on top, and an empty Bucket underneath. The lower bucket will turn into a Bucket of Tar, whilst the top bucket will become a Bucket of Gasoline. Tar can be used as an ingredient in crafting, and can yield Black Paint when mixed with Slime, whilst Gasoline can be used to fuel the Lamp (3 Gold top, 1 Bucket of Gasoline bottom, 2 Steel either side of Gasoline, 1 Restone Torch in centre, 2 Glass either side of Redstone Torch) and other similar devices.

Oil is VERY flammable, so don&#39;t set it on fire as it is, and if a Lava flow should come into contact with it, it&#39;s pretty much gone. Another nifty thing is that it will treat Water like a solid surface, since everyone knows Oil floats on Water.

One tiny last thing to mention: the Tap (make an L shape out of Steel or Gold, only tilted 90 degrees clockwise, and put a stone button on the middle-top square). This can be used to extract Resin from Wood, and also to extract liquids from a block that is next to a liquid block. Simply place the Tap on the block/Wood, and use a Bucket on it to extract the liquid. This can be handy when prospecting, as it can help tell you if you&#39;re near a liquid, be it Water, Lava or Oil.

So, here I covered Hamburgers, Milk, Chemistry, Paints, Oil, and the Tap. Be sure to review and report on the viability of these ideas. Cheers if you do."
