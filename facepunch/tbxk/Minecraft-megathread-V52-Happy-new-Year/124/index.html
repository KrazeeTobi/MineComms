Notch has been taking a break for the past 6 months. All he cares about is the flow of money, not the game or the community.

Poor attempt at trolling. Notch has been setting up the company, getting offices etc so he hasnt been taking a break for the last 6 months. The SMP updates took an inordinate amount of time due to the complexity of coding them and finally as the game is in BETA, we get to test the updates. If you dont like it feel free to leave the game alone until it is officially finished."

Every update that has been released has been unfinished, buggy, breaks more than it fixes, and doesn&#39;t really add anything. Notch doesn&#39;t even test his updates. His priority is money, not the game.[/QUOTE]

Poor attempt at trolling. Notch has been setting up the company, getting offices etc so he hasnt been taking a break for the last 6 months. The SMP updates took an inordinate amount of time due to the complexity of coding them and finally as the game is in BETA, we get to test the updates. If you dont like it feel free to leave the game alone until it is officially finished.</span>
