Uh yeah it turned into a 3-player lets play thing, then Asrue decided that he &#39;was bored of Minecraft&#39; and left. It was just me and Afro so I thought &quot;screw it this won&#39;t work, will it?&quot; and left too. Considering doing a singleplayer Lets Play but it&#39;d be pretty boring.

On another note, somebody should host like a 5 player server that a few of us could play on to get away from the more heavily populated servers that have already got well geared players."

Replace the level.dat with that from another save, use NBTEdit and Minotur to locate/edit in your old spawn point.

My indoor tree farm deals with these problems by having dirt only where I plant the saplings, and having walls I can walk on top of in order to reach the tops of taller trees.
