Its his server, his rules. If someone made a gold members server would you baww about it? If he&#39;s hosting he makes the rules, retarded or not. 

How can a person hosting a server discern between a griefer and a good player, without allowing them onto the server first? Join date or post count, when the players come from FP. Being here now means you have a good idea about how to behave in online games and on servers, so it only makes sense that by using the join date as a qualifier, newer members will be [U]less[/U] able to understand server rules, compared to an 05er or 06er. 

Sure there are anomalies, but alot of 09ers and 10ers are going to servers to grief. You guys set up your servers when you can and make your rules then, you&#39;ll soon know how fucking annoying it is when people give out your IP and a griefer crashes it or destroys everyting you&#39;ve been building.[/QUOTE]


So what you&#39;re saying is that since i joined 4 months late, even though i had been lurking for half a year BEFORE that, I&#39;m instantly unqualified to make logical decisions on what is right and wrong or understanding the rules and how to play online?

That is the screening. The whole process of rejection via date is the screening process. It&#39;s dumb and ideally everyone should get to play on the server and have a fair try, i agree with you; but at the end of the day, if your a server owner you want to safeguard the shit thats been built and also to stop it being crashed or griefed, and if the only way to realistically stop it being griefed is to let a few people in then so be it."

I never said the logic was correct. Give me another way of stopping griefers effectively without them crashing the server or destroying other peoples builds.

Please tell me a way to guarantee it?

There isn&#39;t a way. This is just an effective method, that, and word of mouth concerning griefers."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=justin1992;23906430]But see, he&#39;s not letting only a few, trusted people in though. He&#39;s letting all of the 06&#39;ers and older in, which is quite a few people, and still has griefers in it. I guess what I&#39;m saying is his logic is flawed. Doing this won&#39;t prevent griefing it will only prolong when it will happen due to having a smaller amount of people in it.[/QUOTE]
