We used to be cool with eachother but you&#39;ve suddenly turned into a dick, i don&#39;t know what the hell is going on but people on FP have turned snap-fucking-happy and gotta be jerks about the smallest little things...It&#39;s not just you eather, it&#39;s everyone...Is school starting making everyone ancy or something?"

Still accepting people for my private server town. We have a good mine and are starting the town.[/QUOTE]

I didn&#39;t ask for anyone&#39;s oppinion on my post and i can &quot;Whine&quot; about whatever i want. This is my opinion of SMP. If you don&#39;t like what i have to say about it that&#39;s all fine and dandy with me but i don&#39;t want to hear it. We used to be cool with eachother but you&#39;ve suddenly turned into a dick, i don&#39;t know what the hell is going on but people on FP have turned snap-fucking-happy and gotta be jerks about the smallest little things...It&#39;s not just you eather, it&#39;s everyone...Is school starting making everyone ancy or something?</span>

Nope. No crafting guides are up now, for some reason. Strange.

Yes, you&#39;re right, I should be happy it&#39;s even out, because Notch OBVIOUSLY could not have waited until he could update it on a stable schedule. I&#39;m happy he released it because it made the players who just couldn&#39;t wait shut up about their gripes and play for once. YOU PEOPLE kept bugging him about it and that was the only reason he released the unfinished software in the first place. But, you are wrong, I&#39;m not harshly judging the Alpha, I&#39;m judging how the playerbase reacted to the game and how they brought the griefing and annoyance on themselves by bugging Notch so much that he released an unfinished product and wasn&#39;t satisfied with it.

I quote myself:

[quote]It&#39;s an alpha. Everything will eventually be fixed one way or another, but for now, I was right. This thread has been filled with people complaining about SMP and taunting each other with &quot;private servers&quot; that they eventually give out to everyone and I can&#39;t help but think that this is how I predicted it was going to turn out all along.[/quote]

That&#39;s where I said the same thing you just said. It&#39;s not a finished game and I don&#39;t expect it to be perfect or even playable to its full extent. I didn&#39;t say I disliked the SMP client because it was laggy or broken, never ONCE did I say the mechanics of the game were turning me away from it. I said that the players were turning me away, and there was nothing anybody could do about it, because regardless of whether the game is finished or not, these people are always going to exist and it&#39;s just not possible to make them go away for good.

[/QUOTE]

The fanbase was hyped by the previews notch would leak out every now and then, he caused them to be like that. Notch also said he was going to release it soon, even before the &quot;begging&quot; got worse. I think Notch wanted to release the game now before he left to go to Berlin is so that the game wouldn&#39;t get boring with no update for 5 or so days. The griefing is also fueled by people like you crying about the players, they know they can get something out of you.  The only people that I&#39;ve seen have problems with the SMP are you and justin.

Yeah, having to survive would also probably bring the players together to fend for eachother. Building an impenetrable fortress during the day, sharing resources and tools, but during the night, holding out and trying to survive!"

There. I&#39;m done. I said my piece. That&#39;s all I have to say about it. I will speak of it no more.[/quote]

SMP wasn&#39;t released early, if you pay attention to his blog posts, you can see that he had been planning on releasing it near, or on the date that he did. I&#39;m not saying your opinion is wrong, I&#39;m just trying to tell you that because there are servers with bad players/admins, doesn&#39;t mean that all are bad. I&#39;m sorry if I pissed you off at all, I&#39;m just speaking my mind. Expressing myself. That&#39;s my 2 cents. Etc. 

..and it wasn&#39;t rushed, I still don&#39;t understand why you keep saying that.
