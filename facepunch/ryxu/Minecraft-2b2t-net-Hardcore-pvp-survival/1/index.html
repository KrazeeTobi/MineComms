This is the spawn. The entire area around 1000 blocks of the spawn feels like a nuclear apocalypse, with ruined buildings, giant craters, and nothing surviving for more than a few days. It&amp;#8217;s pretty much a cesspool of griefing and destruction. That&amp;#8217;s what I loved about it, however. There was a raw feel of survival. No rules, no admins, full strategy and PvP action.

We later met with the creator of this &amp;#8220;castle&amp;#8221; and learned of its history, but for then, we just hid in the expansive mines underneath it. There were thousands of tunnels under it, and led to many areas around the spawn. It was a true set of catacombs.
 
After a little bit, a thread of mine about this server gained popularity, and many other facepunchers joined in the fun. We eventually had a bustling area simply built around a single staircase.

Eventually, we moved out to a seperate castle due to the lack of space and being too close to the spawn. This castle was an amazing fortress of solitude and happiness. We eventually got a working system of government (for the most part), jobs, and a decent infrastructure of facepunchers. Here&amp;#8217;s a picture of a meeting. (I&amp;#8217;m the one at the front of the room)

Sadly, all things had to come to an end. Base number two was destroyed by hackers with their hacked in TNT.

We found another base the next day. It was a bustling castle with a wide open courtyard. Some 4channers with hacks shortly destroyed this too.

Facepunchers are persistent, so we moved onto another area. After a brief struggle with two separate bases, we moved into a cave system, led again by me. We made a nice courtyard, fountain, and other fun things. (+1074x, -128z)

This base lasted a while. I moved from it for a bit, and let Icytruth take control of it in place of me. Sadly, it was taken by creepers. Numerous explosions near the entrance flooded it, and creepers were swept in by the water, making it inhabitable. It was lost and forgotten.
 
Base number 5 (+1090x, +365z) was found completely by accident. After the creeper invasion, I moved elsewhere to find a nice area for a sweet underground base. After digging down a bit, I fell into this:

[img_thumb]http://gyazo.com/3395e0ff9e3ff7b00d42ebacf9e9744c.png[/img_thumb]
 
This base was the best of them all. We inhabited it and changed it to our needs. I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure how the base fell, but I think it was a friendly hacker turning evil after someone hurt him. Not too sure, but it was later inhabited again. Not sure if people still live there. The location was later told over chat by KombatDoctor, and the location compromised. It&amp;#8217;s likely being griefed and looted right now.
 
Eventually, we moved and created base number six. I put Startoad in charge of this one, and he ran it pretty well with the exception of a bit of bickering between him and Dachande. It was named Camp General Discussion, and another camp was made into Camp Creationism Corner. This is when I worked on a secret project, &amp;#8220;Project Arsenal&amp;#8221;, a mob trap hidden in a desert, made to provide military equipment to our military to ward off hackers and other potental threats.
 
From here on out, the history gets muddled. There&amp;#8217;s multiple bases used to house people from different camps. Life is pretty well, except for two mysterious people in diamond armor that scared us near spawn. 
 
This is a brief history of the Facepunch campain in this server. Tell me if you have pictures or more info! When this is all over (server shutdown, ultimate destruction of facepunchers, total conquering of the entire server), I&amp;#8217;ll make a thread about it.[/QUOTE]

[release][B]2b2t.net[/B]
The entire world has been fried, fractured and fucked. It is a desolate and generally stinky place where few things can survive. People are particularly unhappy getting killed and shat on, getting their houses weeks spent on destroyed, and being hated by other hated faggots.
 
This is a free for all (no rules) pvp survival server where everything goes, and currently uses /v/ and /b/, something awful, minecraft server list retards and more for its players to create a horrible world (or server if you prefer that) and now I&#39;m adding facepunch to the pool. If you like drama and observing stupid shit, you should pay a visit.[/release]

We found another base the next day. It was a bustling castle with a wide open courtyard. Some 4channers with hacks shortly destroyed this too.

Facepunchers are persistent, so we moved onto another area. After a brief struggle with two separate bases, we moved into a cave system, led again by me. We made a nice courtyard, fountain, and other fun things. (+1074x, -128z)

This base lasted a while. I moved from it for a bit, and let Icytruth take control of it in place of me. Sadly, it was taken by creepers. Numerous explosions near the entrance flooded it, and creepers were swept in by the water, making it inhabitable. It was lost and forgotten.
 
Base number 5 (+1090x, +365z) was found completely by accident. After the creeper invasion, I moved elsewhere to find a nice area for a sweet underground base. After digging down a bit, I fell into this:

This base was the best of them all. We inhabited it and changed it to our needs. I&amp;#8217;m not exactly sure how the base fell, but I think it was a friendly hacker turning evil after someone hurt him. Not too sure, but it was later inhabited again. Not sure if people still live there. The location was later told over chat by KombatDoctor, and the location compromised. It&amp;#8217;s likely being griefed and looted right now.
 
Eventually, we moved and created base number six. I put Startoad in charge of this one, and he ran it pretty well with the exception of a bit of bickering between him and Dachande. It was named Camp General Discussion, and another camp was made into Camp Creationism Corner. This is when I worked on a secret project, &amp;#8220;Project Arsenal&amp;#8221;, a mob trap hidden in a desert, made to provide military equipment to our military to ward off hackers and other potental threats.
 
From here on out, the history gets muddled. There&amp;#8217;s multiple bases used to house people from different camps. Life is pretty well, except for two mysterious people in diamond armor that scared us near spawn. 
 
This is a brief history of the Facepunch campain in this server. Tell me if you have pictures or more info! When this is all over (server shutdown, ultimate destruction of facepunchers, total conquering of the entire server), I&amp;#8217;ll make a thread about it.[/QUOTE]

[release][B]2b2t.net[/B]
The entire world has been fried, fractured and fucked. It is a desolate and generally stinky place where few things can survive. People are particularly unhappy getting killed and shat on, getting their houses weeks spent on destroyed, and being hated by other hated faggots.
 
This is a free for all (no rules) pvp survival server where everything goes, and currently uses /v/ and /b/, something awful, minecraft server list retards and more for its players to create a horrible world (or server if you prefer that) and now I&#39;m adding facepunch to the pool. If you like drama and observing stupid shit, you should pay a visit.[/release]

That PEACE has been there for over a month. The server is also currently down until bukkit updates.

Interesting facts:
7649 players have their soul saved.
The map is 8,6 gb and 7 months old.
Someone has &quot;walked&quot; 150,000~ blocks.
Some people decided to find and count ruins(on ground). They counted up to 295 within 30,000 blocks of spawn. (This could be a lie)
Map needs to be reset soon unless I buy more ram."
