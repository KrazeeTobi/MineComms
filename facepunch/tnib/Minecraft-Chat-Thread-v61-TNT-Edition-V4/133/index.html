You have absolutely no proof he isn&#39;t actually working on these problems right now, just because he doesn&#39;t talk about them doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t working on them, he talks to people about things they think are nice and interesting, new content and such, talking about bugfixes isn&#39;t very fun is it? Although he should."

Say you&#39;re coming from spawn, you hit the button which gives you a cart to ride in which takes off automatically, and you type in /st stationname to go there, and the system does the rest.

So far the stations are, Spawn, Treeland, Shadowmarsh, Bobville, Bunkerville, soon also Crampture, Ventle, Verticopolis, Dungeon and Moa therma. 

Crampture already has the subway dug, but not connected to the main grid yet, and the other cities, nothing yet :v:

I might install dynmap just for the top down and cave map :v:[/QUOTE]
 
Unfortunatley Moa therma is gonna take some time. set that as last priority.
