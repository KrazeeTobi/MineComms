                        <postrender input="Anyone remember this? :smith: 

[code]- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.
- Cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP!
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits![/code]

                            <span v-pre>Anyone remember this? :smith: 

[code]- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.
- Cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP!
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits![/code]

Also, he said we&#39;d need cocoa beans to craft it. So I replied with the suggestion of putting Cocoa Beans in the loot table of Dungeon Chests. This&#39;d make the Beans pretty valuable, even if it were a temporary solution before making a Bean Pod block that spawns on trees in biomes that are warm and wet.

Also also, to dissipate any confusion, here&#39;s what I done talked about.

[code]- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.
- Cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP!
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits![/code]

- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.
- Cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP!
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits![/code]
