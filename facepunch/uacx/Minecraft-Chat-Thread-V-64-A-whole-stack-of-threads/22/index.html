He is far from lazy and I commend him for doing what he has. What he has done is not easy, and he did a good job doing that. So you didn,t even read my post right. Good job.

He does work for me. He works for everybody that gave him money for his game. Thats what being a game developer is. What also comes with that is being his own boss. He can do whatever he wants. We aren&#39;t his boss, but he [U]does[/U] work for us as consumers. Period. If you don&#39;t get that then you are too stupid to understand the concept of supply and demand.

What have I done? Oh about as much as a person my age in my position can. Held a job since I was 14 years old. Purchased two vehicles [B]myself[/B] by the time I was 17. Going through my fourth semester in college with a solid 3.9 GPA. Collecting academic awards. Finally getting film equipment I need to start making inde films. Because you know, I gotta have examples before I can get in the Los Angeles Film school I&#39;ll probably be going to next year. What have you done? yell at a lot of people on the internet?

Every one of you? See now you are so blind with your need to white-knight Notch that you dont even pay attention to what I say. Instead you pair me up with the idiots and children who actually call Notch lazy.

Halfed-assed homework? I graduated highschool when I was 16 and have been sailing through college ever since (except for that oen semester where I took it easy to relax a bit). Now that in itself isnt an amazing feat, but you can&#39;t do that and &quot;turn in (much at all) homework half-assed&quot;. Infact, my half-assed homework assignments (honestly) get A grades in college critical literature analysis classes.

Good job looking stupid in your blind rage for the people who actually do call Notch lazy.[/QUOTE]

[I]I[/I] look stupid?  You&#39;re the one going into film school . . .

[zing]

Also, the you was a collective you, as in 2nd person plural you.  Of course there are exceptions, duh.  You seem to be one of them.  But you can&#39;t know how much he is working, and if he is working for you . . . you paid him $10 for how many hours of work?  That sounds like a sucky ass deal to me. . ."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=D0C H.;30009992]I expect him to work some. I want to first point out that I never called him lazy. He is far from lazy and I commend him for doing what he has. What he has done is not easy, and he did a good job doing that. So you didn,t even read my post right. Good job.

He does work for me. He works for everybody that gave him money for his game. Thats what being a game developer is. What also comes with that is being his own boss. He can do whatever he wants. We aren&#39;t his boss, but he [U]does[/U] work for us as consumers. Period. If you don&#39;t get that then you are too stupid to understand the concept of supply and demand.

What have I done? Oh about as much as a person my age in my position can. Held a job since I was 14 years old. Purchased two vehicles [B]myself[/B] by the time I was 17. Going through my fourth semester in college with a solid 3.9 GPA. Collecting academic awards. Finally getting film equipment I need to start making inde films. Because you know, I gotta have examples before I can get in the Los Angeles Film school I&#39;ll probably be going to next year. What have you done? yell at a lot of people on the internet?

Every one of you? See now you are so blind with your need to white-knight Notch that you dont even pay attention to what I say. Instead you pair me up with the idiots and children who actually call Notch lazy.

Halfed-assed homework? I graduated highschool when I was 16 and have been sailing through college ever since (except for that oen semester where I took it easy to relax a bit). Now that in itself isnt an amazing feat, but you can&#39;t do that and &quot;turn in (much at all) homework half-assed&quot;. Infact, my half-assed homework assignments (honestly) get A grades in college critical literature analysis classes.

Good job looking stupid in your blind rage for the people who actually do call Notch lazy.[/QUOTE]

Also, the you was a collective you, as in 2nd person plural you.  Of course there are exceptions, duh.  You seem to be one of them.

That still doesn&#39;t answer his question, what [i]have[/i] you done that isn&#39;t yelling at people over the internet. It doesn&#39;t even seem like you read his whole argument.

Also, it isn&#39;t only him that paid 10 dollars, it&#39;s a few hundred thousand that paid 10 dollars plus another few hundred thousand that paid him 15 dollars each. That totals up to anywhere between $10 million and $15 million. Does that sound like a sucky ass deal?"

Oh, I didn&#39;t know calling out logical fallacies was legal on the internet.  In that case, your whole argument about how much he should work is unsubstantiated.  You say that &quot;one update a week was acceptable,&quot; and then say that &quot;one update every three weeks in too slow.&quot;  By your argument, if I follow how your argument goes:

1 update a week = good work (worthy of the fortune he has made).
1 update every three weeks = bad (slow) work (not worthy of the fortune he has made).
To sum up this argument in a Toulmin statement:  Notch should update the game every week because he is making millions of dollars off of the sale of the game.  
The assumption here is that the harder you work, the more money you should make (and you&#39;re going to work with [I]actors[/I] for the rest of your life?  Have you met an actor???).  Another assumption is that Notch should continue to update the game (even more) because he has made more money.

However, there are many flaws here.

Flaw one:  Show me, in &#39;Merica, where time working + output = more money.  Sure, there are exceptions like doctors, lawyers, etc.  But look at celebrities.  Look at athletes.  Compare them to factory workers, construction workers.  Look at a typical retail store, and the people standing all day helping bitchy customers vs. the store managers who &quot;manage&quot; those people.  Who works harder and who gets paid more?  This definition seems to not work too well.

At heart here is the definition of what you mean by work.  Granted, I tweaked your definition because you say &quot;slowly.&quot;  I&#39;m assuming that the more time you put into something, the harder you work.

But still, that definition is lacking . . . what is &quot;hard work?&quot;  And what is fair compensation?  Furthermore, is it fair to say that he was compensated the most when he was working the hardest, and now that sales have plateaued, he&#39;s working less?

So far, only Obsidian and the Bookcase took me more than 10 minutes to make, with about an hour spent on obsidian, and 30 minutes on the bookcase.

What are you even on about? Why are you trying to analyze my statement and distort it to an equation? Seriously? What is wrong with you? Why do you care about what I say? Why is it [b]so[/b] important to attack what I say? Do you flip out on the people who say he is being lazy? Do you waste time and posts on people who say he isn&#39;t a good game developer? No. Instead you found it important enough to attack my statement about him working a little too slow. [b] IN MY OPINION.[/b] Do you enjoy that or something?

Proof? -Lack of content- That is the proof. Now was there a large gap in content? No, it was just shown how much he has actually been working on bug fixing. 
I also did not say that he should work harder because he has made more money. People work really hard so they can work less and make more money. That&#39;s what everybody aspires to do. I simply stated that he should [u]continue[/u] to work. At the time it appeared he was not working on anything. If it had turned out so, my statement would be completely valid. Instead, he has been hard at work fixing bugs, and we simply didn&#39;t know about it.
Also also, it&#39;s not ad-hominem. You first directed it at me, to which I replied, then simply asked yourself. I did[u]not[/u] attack you. (except for calling you stupid for completely distorting all of what I said, which still stands) 

The fact of the matter is you get off on starting arguments with people, on the internet. I believed Notch was working too slow. It turned out he was not. (However, if he was working on absolutely nothing, my point would be completely valid) End of the matter. Also, stop trying to sound smart by analyzing a ([highlight]distorted[/highlight]) version of my &quot;argument&quot;. Its sad.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=cephalopoid;30018089]Oh, I didn&#39;t know calling out logical fallacies was legal on the internet.  In that case, your whole argument about how much he should work is unsubstantiated.  You say that &quot;one update a week was acceptable,&quot; and then say that &quot;one update every three weeks in too slow.&quot;  By your argument, if I follow how your argument goes:

1 update a week = good work (worthy of the fortune he has made).
1 update every three weeks = bad (slow) work (not worthy of the fortune he has made).
To sum up this argument in a Toulmin statement:  Notch should update the game every week because he is making millions of dollars off of the sale of the game.  
The assumption here is that the harder you work, the more money you should make (and you&#39;re going to work with [I]actors[/I] for the rest of your life?  Have you met an actor???).  Another assumption is that Notch should continue to update the game (even more) because he has made more money.

However, there are many flaws here.

Flaw one:  Show me, in &#39;Merica, where time working + output = more money.  Sure, there are exceptions like doctors, lawyers, etc.  But look at celebrities.  Look at athletes.  Compare them to factory workers, construction workers.  Look at a typical retail store, and the people standing all day helping bitchy customers vs. the store managers who &quot;manage&quot; those people.  Who works harder and who gets paid more?  This definition seems to not work too well.

At heart here is the definition of what you mean by work.  Granted, I tweaked your definition because you say &quot;slowly.&quot;  I&#39;m assuming that the more time you put into something, the harder you work. Hell, in &#39;Merica, we overpay for things all the time.  Our concept of &quot;fair compensation&quot; is very inconsistent.  

But still, that definition is lacking . . . what is &quot;hard work?&quot;  And what is fair compensation?  Furthermore, is it fair to say that he was compensated the most when he was working the hardest, and now that sales have plateaued, he&#39;s working less?

And then, the crux of your argument . . . where is your proof?  Sure, he tweets about meetings and vacations and going home . . . he doesn&#39;t tweet like he used to about working . . . aside from that . . . where is your proof that he isn&#39;t working on the game constantly?  Show me.

You seem to define his work by the rate of output.  Wouldn&#39;t it be better to rate the work by the quality of the output?  Or how complex a task it is to create the output?

The main problem with your argument is that you fail to define all these terms, and then you fail to actually prove, except in the most general ways, that Notch is in fact, not working on the game.  I reacted to that in a very general way, and because I deal with college freshmen who turn in half-assed essays all the time, the idea of &quot;work&quot; and &quot;output&quot; and &quot;time&quot; is a hot-button issue with me.

What have I done in that last year?  That&#39;s ad-hominem, too.  But in case you were wondering, I teach writing and argument at the local college.

Oh, and by the way, I hope there is no hard feelings.  When I make cracks about film-makers and actors, I&#39;m joking.  I love film-making, and respect writers and directors and cinematographers and grips for all the joy they bring to the world.  I have known many actors and ran with the professional theater crowd for a few years.  I don&#39;t hold much respect for actors.  Sorry.  

Anyway, this argument is boiled down to a pissing contest.  And for that, it has become boring (yet I still wrote waaaaay too much).  

Just lay off Notch.  He gave us something beautiful.  If he stopped working on it now, I would be indebted.  In fact, to avoid doing a Lucas (as in George, creator and ruiner of the Star Wars universe), maybe he [i]should[/i] stop working on it.[/QUOTE]
