Review
In this review i will show you the good and bad points about this game.
The Good Points
Minecraft is a world of creation and survival. In this game you are able to create a new world. The surface is 8 times the size of the actual world so you have lots of space to build your own creation. In this game you can build any thing you want like a small house, tower, a fort or a cave. You can also dig down to the centre of the planet and reach the point where lava is. You are able to pick it up with a bucket! You can also make a portal and go to hell, if thats what you want to do. You are able to create tools such as pickaxes. These tools allow you to mine down and find different types of materials such as coal, gravel, iron redstone or even gold and diamonds!
In Minecraft there are two modes-Survival Mode and Creative Mode.
[B]The Survival Mode[/B]
In this mode you need to gather the supplies you self (e.g wood, stone) and build a house to fend off the monsters (zombies, spiders, creepers, skeletons). All the monsters respawn at night so you only have 20 minutes to find shelter on the first night. Night lasts 8mins.
[B]Classic mode[/B]
In this mode there are no monsters just infinity. There is a never ending supply of material, you can build freely without ever dying. 
Minecraft’s website allows you to download different game looks (texture packs) so you can get the perfect look that suits your wants and needs.
[B]The Bad Points[/B]
The graphics of the game are terrible. If the graphics were good the game would suffer from lagging. The answer to this would be that you would need an awesome gaming computer.
There are also timing issues with this game for example if you are playing in survival mode then you only have twenty minutes to get all your supplies and make a house. If what you make is not good enough then you will die. The reason for this is that there are no levels and monsters will make an appearance even in the first night.[/release]
