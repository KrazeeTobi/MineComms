Seriously, you bought a beta.  He owes you nothing more than that.  Sure, he said that you will get the full game when it is completed, but outside of that, he has promised less than Valve has with Episode 3.  

I really hate how people like you say that Notch is lazy and isn&#39;t working fast/hard enough for you.  

A.  He does not work for you.  The only person that works for you is the babysitter/nanny your mom and dad hired to wipe your asses with golden tissue.

B.  He programmed a hit game, started a business, won some major awards, hired a bunch of people, moved into and set up an office, and became a millionaire in about a year and a half.  [B]What the fuck have you done in the last year?[/B]

C.  Look at his tweets.  He&#39;s constantly working.  He&#39;s fixing bugs and working on game content.  When he&#39;s not doing that, it seems he&#39;s having meetings and [B]running a fucking business like a boss[/B].  

D.  I hope that every one of you that calls Notch lazy never, ever turns in half-assed homework or essays ever again.  Seriously, you all sound very, very spoiled.  You make &#39;Mericans look bad.[/QUOTE]
 

I expect him to work some. I want to first point out that I never called him lazy. He is far from lazy and I commend him for doing what he has. What he has done is not easy, and he did a good job doing that. So you didn,t even read my post right. Good job.

He does work for me. He works for everybody that gave him money for his game. Thats what being a game developer is. What also comes with that is being his own boss. He can do whatever he wants. We aren&#39;t his boss, but he [u]does[/u] work for us as consumers. Period. If you don&#39;t get that then you are too stupid to understand the concept of supply and demand.

What have I done? Oh about as much as a person my age in my position can. Held a job since I was 14 years old. Purchased two vehicles [b]myself[/b] by the time I was 17. Going through my fourth semester in college with a solid 3.9 GPA. Collecting academic awards. Finally getting film equipment I need to start making inde films. Because you know, I gotta have examples before I can get in the Los Angeles Film school I&#39;ll probably be going to next year. What have you done? yell at a lot of people on the internet?

Every one of you? See now you are so blind with your need to white-knight Notch that you dont even pay attention to what I say. Instead you pair me up with the idiots and children who actually call Notch lazy.

Halfed-assed homework? I graduated highschool when I was 16 and have been sailing through college ever since (except for that oen semester where I took it easy to relax a bit). Now that in itself isnt an amazing feat, but you can&#39;t do that and &quot;turn in (much at all) homework half-assed&quot;. Infact, my half-assed homework assignments (honestly) get A grades in college critical literature analysis classes.

Good job looking stupid in your blind rage for the people who actually do call Notch lazy."
