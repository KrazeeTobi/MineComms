My post in the 1.6 thread:


 
I notice however that my opinion, though was forming slowly over time, has drastically solidified after the release of Terraria. I notice also that you too play Terraria making me understand that with the differences of the two games those who play both come to realize exactly what Minecraft is missing that could greatly improve gameplay and replayability.

Both games do have something similar. Both developers make a promise of frequent updates and bug fixes. Terraria has released it&#39;s first update a week after the initial release, but it did not add or fix a whole lot in that time frame. A week is a very long time to fix a dozen things, they could have easily done so much more.

Minecraft however as we all know releases updates as they see fit. Whenever they are available after their many vacations or conventions. They are hardly ever in the office doing work and with that completely tore apart the weekly updates leaving numerous bugs, glitches and never adding enough features to come close to finishing the game. And if I didn&#39;t know any better I&#39;d say notch doesn&#39;t listen to his fan base in the slightest and instead only his close friends and/or co-workers. This is something we all took for granted several months ago and now notch has no interest in what we want and strongly believes his game is great the way it is. He repeatedly says he has a vision of what he wants but he never once comes close to doing it.[/QUOTE]
 
I remember the days where he was active, joining my podcast for an episode, chatting with people in the IRC, talking to people and generally being active with the community. Nowadays, it&#39;s just bland. Terraria offers replayability, fun exploration, and so much more content right out of the gate, with plenty more to come later. It&#39;s a minecraft-ish game that replaces what it was inspired by."

As I progress through the cave system, I end up getting caught in lava and die. It wasn&#39;t too bad, as I had only lost a couple iron pickaxes and a few iron ores. (I had just started a new world). So I respawn, go to my shelter, and get supplies and go back down to find the items that hadn&#39;t been caught in the lava. I go back down, and unfortunately don&#39;t find where I died. I decide to go start mining again, as there was no point to me going back up to the surface. I end up finding 2 diamonds, 18 gold ores, and 34 iron ores. I was deep in the cave system at this point, so I decided to head back. Suddenly, this skeleton falls down out of nowhere and starts pelting me with arrows. I get knocked back into a river. The skeleton is shooting me with arrows while I&#39;m struggling to get out of the water and away from the skeleton, but end up dying. Again. So I respawn, and guess what? Obviously it wasn&#39;t enough to kill me and make me lose valuable possesions deep in a cave; this happens:

I barely escape and head back to my shelter. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, there was a spider waiting for me at the entrance to my shelter. My entrance has a drawbridge, and a pit under it. And, of course, the spider knocks me into my pit. I don&#39;t lose any hearts, but I&#39;m forced to dig my way out through rock. When i get into my shelter, I take the last of my supplies and go back to get the diamonds. I eventually find my way to where I died in a river. As soon as I get to my items, 2 creepers drop down [b]right[/b] above me and blow up. I die, and the diamonds and the majority of the gold and iron ore are destroyed. Right now I don&#39;t feel like going  back there. It just isn&#39;t worth it... :suicide:"
