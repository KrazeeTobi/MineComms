I have a similar view of Minecraft as of late.
My post in the 1.6 thread:

[QUOTE=EastBayWilly;30067877]Not much need to become attached to any world. At the moment no world has anything significant that another does not. They may appear different and the biomes may be of varying sizes. But in the end, each world is exactly the same. Boring really, but Minecraft is in Beta. I hope that as the months go by worlds will be more unique. I want a reason to care for any of my worlds.

Also even with this latest update I&#39;m rather bored of the game. I used to love it and have great fun but SMP lags too much for me, there aren&#39;t enough threats in the world to make it dangerous and without any goals such as boss monsters, major events, or anything extravagant to discover except for that really cool cliff face, there is nothing to keep you from becoming bored as all hell.

Notch needs to find a way to make Minecraft fun, challenging, and really bring to the table something that&#39;ll make exploration and discoveries amazing.

I still love this game, I just see so much unused potential.[/QUOTE]
 
I notice however that my opinion, though was forming slowly over time, has drastically solidified after the release of Terraria. I notice also that you too play Terraria making me understand that with the differences of the two games those who play both come to realize exactly what Minecraft is missing that could greatly improve gameplay and replayability.

Both games do have something similar. Both developers make a promise of frequent updates and bug fixes. Terraria has released it&#39;s first update a week after the initial release, but it did not add or fix a whole lot in that time frame. A week is a very long time to fix a dozen things, they could have easily done so much more.

Minecraft however as we all know releases updates as they see fit. Whenever they are available after their many vacations or conventions. They are hardly ever in the office doing work and with that completely tore apart the weekly updates leaving numerous bugs, glitches and never adding enough features to come close to finishing the game. And if I didn&#39;t know any better I&#39;d say notch doesn&#39;t listen to his fan base in the slightest and instead only his close friends and/or co-workers. This is something we all took for granted several months ago and now notch has no interest in what we want and strongly believes his game is great the way it is. He repeatedly says he has a vision of what he wants but he never once comes close to doing it."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Chezhead;30068914]I&#39;m pretty much out of minecraft for the time being. I can&#39;t stand it, with notch.

I&#39;ve been on the minecraft community since the beginning, and loved all the fun exciting Friday updates. Now, it&#39;s just a shadow of its former self. Updates are non-existent for months on end, and when something comes out like this, we are excited about fixed features and hatches that hardly work. Oh yeah, maps. I can&#39;t see the use in them for the most part, but some people might.

Also, are pistons that hard to add to the game? Just update the .jar to add the class files, and some new textures! Send the guy a PM and give him $100 or something, maybe more people would play the game?!

Maybe I&#39;ll be back when the game has a decent modding API, or when something is added to the game to make it fun again. I enjoyed the time on this community of Facepunchers, and hope to come back if the game is actually improved. They have an entire development team for christ&#39;s sake! How would it be this hard to actually add things!

Well, see you on the flipside. I&#39;ll be playing Terraria if you need me.

I have a similar view of Minecraft as of late.
My post in the 1.6 thread:

[QUOTE=EastBayWilly;30067877]Not much need to become attached to any world. At the moment no world has anything significant that another does not. They may appear different and the biomes may be of varying sizes. But in the end, each world is exactly the same. Boring really, but Minecraft is in Beta. I hope that as the months go by worlds will be more unique. I want a reason to care for any of my worlds.

Also even with this latest update I&#39;m rather bored of the game. I used to love it and have great fun but SMP lags too much for me, there aren&#39;t enough threats in the world to make it dangerous and without any goals such as boss monsters, major events, or anything extravagant to discover except for that really cool cliff face, there is nothing to keep you from becoming bored as all hell.

Notch needs to find a way to make Minecraft fun, challenging, and really bring to the table something that&#39;ll make exploration and discoveries amazing.

I still love this game, I just see so much unused potential.[/QUOTE]
 
I notice however that my opinion, though was forming slowly over time, has drastically solidified after the release of Terraria. I notice also that you too play Terraria making me understand that with the differences of the two games those who play both come to realize exactly what Minecraft is missing that could greatly improve gameplay and replayability.

Both games do have something similar. Both developers make a promise of frequent updates and bug fixes. Terraria has released it&#39;s first update a week after the initial release, but it did not add or fix a whole lot in that time frame. A week is a very long time to fix a dozen things, they could have easily done so much more.

Minecraft however as we all know releases updates as they see fit. Whenever they are available after their many vacations or conventions. They are hardly ever in the office doing work and with that completely tore apart the weekly updates leaving numerous bugs, glitches and never adding enough features to come close to finishing the game. And if I didn&#39;t know any better I&#39;d say notch doesn&#39;t listen to his fan base in the slightest and instead only his close friends and/or co-workers. This is something we all took for granted several months ago and now notch has no interest in what we want and strongly believes his game is great the way it is. He repeatedly says he has a vision of what he wants but he never once comes close to doing it.</span>
