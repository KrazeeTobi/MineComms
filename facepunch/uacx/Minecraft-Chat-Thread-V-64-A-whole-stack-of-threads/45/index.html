And now the tech support guy tried being a badass, pulling out a quote from the contract regarding cancellation. Apparently, you have to go to a cancellation page to cancel your service. 
(I couldn&#39;t find this page by the way, no matter how hard I looked.)
But hurr, my service is terminated. If that&#39;s not cancellation I don&#39;t what is.

And he is ignoring me now that I pointed this out.[/QUOTE]

If a support tech is being a douchebag, take it up with me and I&#39;ll have it straightened out.

I honestly don&#39;t think I&#39;d be having this issue if he was still there.

Why did you snip that last part about him not getting done with everything that needed to get done?[/QUOTE]
 
lol, no you&#39;d still have the problem. These issues don&#39;t magically appear because Jake is gone."

And now the tech support guy tried being a badass, pulling out a quote from the contract regarding cancellation. Apparently, you have to go to a cancellation page to cancel your service. 
(I couldn&#39;t find this page by the way, no matter how hard I looked.)
But hurr, my service is terminated. If that&#39;s not cancellation I don&#39;t what is.

And he is ignoring me now that I pointed this out.[/QUOTE]

If a support tech is being a douchebag, take it up with me and I&#39;ll have it straightened out.

[QUOTE=silentjubjub;30148082][editline]30th May 2011[/editline]


 
I honestly don&#39;t think I&#39;d be having this issue if he was still there.

[editline]30th May 2011[/editline]

Why did you snip that last part about him not getting done with everything that needed to get done?[/QUOTE]
 
lol, no you&#39;d still have the problem. These issues don&#39;t magically appear because Jake is gone.</span>

Yes... It ends up terminated after being 15 days overdue for a payment. That doesn&#39;t make the person any less responsible for the payment.

That&#39;s not a trap... that&#39;s because the service was so long overdue that the system killed off their account. Again, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that they already had a due invoice."

Yes... It ends up terminated after being 15 days overdue for a payment. That doesn&#39;t make the person any less responsible for the payment.

And if it doesn&#39;t then it&#39;s a consumer trap because I CAN&#39;T cancel it.[/QUOTE]
 
That&#39;s not a trap... that&#39;s because the service was so long overdue that the system killed off their account. Again, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that they already had a due invoice.</span>

Your corporate idea of a consumer trap is different then my idea of a consumer trap but ok.

I was going to buy a new service anyways with the refunded money but initiating a refund was apparently too much of a big deal and was instead told to buy a new service with even more of my hard-earned money.

I&#39;m sorry you feel that way, but when you have an invoice that you don&#39;t want to pay and you want to cancel your service, you contact that company.

If you no longer want Comcast for cable TV and you simply stop paying your invoices, they eventually send you to collections and hit your credit report. The next time you go to get service, you are required to pay all past-due bills before you open new service. This is no different.

Same goes for the electric company.
Same goes for the telephone company.
Same goes for your cell phone bill.
Same goes for any other provider you use.

Why do you think that things should be different with us from any other provider that you use on a day to day basis?"

I was going to buy a new service anyways with the refunded money but initiating a refund was apparently too much of a big deal and was instead told to buy a new service with even more of my hard-earned money.

Never using this provider again. Have fun with your ever-decreasing revenue.

Hey, I&#39;m getting bored on my small private server. If anyone wants to join, add to the city, or make something cool, drop me a PM for the IP and whatnot. Really laid back, just don&#39;t build ugly stuff. Vanilla server, no admin/give. Most recent version![/QUOTE]
