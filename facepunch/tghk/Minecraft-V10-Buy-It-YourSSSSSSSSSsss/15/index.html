[QUOTE]Agreed.

All the people chugging down Notch&#39;s load every time he whimpers are obnoxious. He has an obligation. No one said it would be easy, he said he would do it, and we paid him to.

People have a fuck of a lot more stressful lives than Notch&#39;s sitting at a desk and moping about how tough life is. Quit being a bitch.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]Precisely that - you don&#39;t ask for cash and offer a game then stagger around achieving approximately zilch for a year then beg mercy. Pass the project on or open it up to contribution if you can&#39;t deal with it - don&#39;t hide it away possessively where it can&#39;t grow.

Data Realms are doing this with Cortex Command &gt;.&gt;[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]Daniel Pedersen you are an idiot. Raeg purchased the game with the promise that mutiplayer would be up in two months. Notch has half a month left. Raeg has every right to be pissed off when he gave money to a guy who is going on a break because his life is so damn stressful sitting back taking money from people for his half finished game letting the deadlines he has pass by.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]fuck sake dude, you said multiplayer would be out within 2 months. it&#39;s already been like a month and a half. you should have listened to the people saying multiplayer would take ages. these annoying as fuck updates that have hardly any content make me rage. you&#39;ve been working so slow since the get-go (since you got heavy rain)...[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]:&#39;( your life is so stressful/

You promised us a game. We paid for a game. It isn&#39;t time for a break it is time to suck it the fuck up and finish the game we paid for.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]I don&#39;t care if the game didn&#39;t cost that much. I purchased it because I thought the guy making it was going to actually work on it. And now that tons of people have paid him he is just taking a break from doing anything and slowing down before that.

I don&#39;t give a shit about the stress in his life. He is doing a job. Normal people don&#39;t get to take a break from working because there life is stressful.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]COME ON PEOPLE, OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES. HE MADE 160.000&amp;#8364; FUCK. HOW MUCH BETTER MOTIVATION CAN YOU GET? MY MOTHER WORKS FOR 8 HOURS A DAY AND GETS PAID 14000&amp;#8364; YEARLY AND HER WORK TRULY IS STRESSFUL. NOT LIKE YOU NOTCH, YOU ONLY SIT AT HOME AND DO NOTHING BUT COMPLAIN. TALK ABOUT LAZY... LIKE ADDING A NEW BLOCK OR AN ENEMY IS SUCH HARD WORK. COME ON GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE WITH THAT BULLSHIT[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]WELL FUCK YOU NOTCH, NOT MOTIVATED ENOUGH ARE YOU? WHAT ABOUT FUCKING 160.000 &amp;#8364; YOU MADE? I CAN&#39;T FUCKING BELIEVE HOW DUMB I WAS TO PAY FOR YOUR SHITTY JAVA GAME.[/QUOTE]

My answer is, of course, the same answer I give to all idiots on the internet: lol u mad?

Seriously, these people are flipping their fucking shit because Notch is taking a break. How fucking spoiled can a 13 year old who bought a Java game possibly get?

MinerCPP also has a few exploits.

For myne, you need python 2.6, python-twisted from twistedmatrix.com (if you can find the 9.0 package, get that. If you can&#39;t, get zope as well.) and simplejson (not a fuggin clue where you&#39;re supposed to get it).

ever tried building something with legos? you try to follow the guide and start putting togther pieces, but for some reason the two bricks won&#39;t snap. you push harder and harder, the piece breaks due to you pushing to hard for some reason. you get really really fucking angry and toss the legos you just built across the room?

think of it like that. something won&#39;t work for him, so instead of being a brat he&#39;ll take a break.

[editline]09:47AM[/editline]

seriously, you&#39;ve never gotten angry when something won&#39;t work for you when you&#39;re building something, and your parnets are like &quot;Oh, just take a break and come back later. No use getting angry&quot; thats what he&#39;s doing, rather have him end up just freaking out and deleting all the code?
