                        <postrender input="[highlight]DOOMISH&#39;S GUIDE TO INDEV (infdev works too i guess)[/highlight]

[B]PART ONE: THE FIRST DAY OR SO[/B]

1. Pick the settings you would like. If you&#39;re good at parachuting into water out of deathly high air, go with small deep island. If otherwise, pick a different combo. The default is normal square island, which I recommend if you just want to play or are just getting started. It&#39;s all completely customizable!

2. Once you pick a map specification and start it up, congrats, you are now in indev! You start in the Spawnhouse,a wood building with plain old stone for a floor. It&#39;s got a 2x1 door so you can fit in, two torches so you can see inside it, and that&#39;s about it. Enjoy it, it&#39;ll be your home until you get it all started.

3. Before you do anything else, you need to get wood. No, that&#39;s not a euphamism for masturbation. Get three log blocks from a tree nearby and hit I. It&#39;ll open up your inventory, where you store your blocks and do simple crafting. The reason I said three blocks is because three blocks will allow you to make one crafting table, one stick pile (four sticks), which in turn will leave you enough for one axe and one pickaxe.

4. Place the log block stack in the top left corner of the crafting box in the top right of your inventory. Grab the plank blocks out of the single right box, and place four of them (right click to place individual blocks) in the left 2x2 square to make a crafting table. Take it back to your spawnhouse and place the crafting table somewhere within reach. From here, you can right click it for a larger 3x3 square.

Go to the following link for ALL the crafting recepies and what the blocks should look like to craft things: [url]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Crafting[/url]

We&#39;ll get to all of the other materials in a separate part.

5. For now, make one pile of sticks, and use the leftover planks to make an axe and a pickaxe. The axe can be used to cut log blocks faster. The pickaxe far shortens the amount of time required to break stone blocks as well as giving you a cobblestone block to place. If you are not using a pickaxe, you will not get a block at all when mining stone.

6. It&#39;s your choice what to do now. Explore your map, mine some stone, cut down some more trees, anything you want. Hell, you can go around hunting sheep and pigs if you want. I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re playing on Normal for this part, so when night falls, retreat to your base, because soon enough you&#39;ll find out why. Take an easy to break block (such as dirt or plank) and place it in the top square of the 1x2 door of your spawnhouse. That way you can hit enemies&#39; legs instead of their faces. It&#39;s safer that way, trust me.

7. Spend this time building up your spawnhouse. If you&#39;re feeling brave, venture out into the darkness and scout out an area to make a new house, though it may cost you your life, because here we are introduced to monsters.

[B]CREEPERS[/B] are the &quot;trademark monster&quot; of Minecraft. They look like regular old mobs except they have four legs, are green, and will explode in your face if you get too close. If you really want to fight them, it&#39;s best to take potshots at them or use arrows (we&#39;ll get to that later) to take them out from afar. If you&#39;re mining an area you can use creepers to your advantage and blow them up where you plan on digging so as to not waste materials. Creepers do NOT burn in the sunlight.

[B]ZOMBIES[/B] are the typical shambling mess. They hold their arms forward and are basically a deceased version of you if you were using the default skin. Killing them is fairly easy, just run up and hit them. They have a fairly large knockback so if you are hit by one just hold S and backpedal to safety. Zombies DO burn in the sunlight.

[B]SKELETONS[/B] are possibly the most dangerous enemy. In the survival mode test, they are fairly inaccurate, but in indev/infdev, they are sharpshooters, and unless you are strafing around them, are guaranteed to hit you. Run at them in a zigzag pattern and strike, then run around them in a circle. Do not stand still when confronted by a skeleton. As with zombies, the arrows knock you back a fairly long distance. If there is a skeleton far below you, you can jump off a large cliff and get hit by one of its arrows in the air, which negates your fall damage. (fall damage will be covered later) Skeletons DO burn in the sunlight.

[B]SPIDERS[/B] are absolutely terrifying, please take note of this now. They are incredibly fast, can fit into 1x1 spaces if they try hard enough, and jump higher than you can aim. If you hit a spider, be prepared to dodge it, because as soon as it hits the ground, it will charge at you again. Confronting spiders head-on is generally not a good idea, and they often spawn in packs of two or three. Be sure to carry torches with you at all times in caves because unlike other mobs, they blend in with the background save for their glowing red eyes. Spiders DO NOT burn in the sunlight.

7.5. To kill monsters easier, craft a sword (see crafting guide). Swords cut the time needed to kill a monster in 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, and eventually 1/2 the hits it would usually take. As with all craftable items, swords take damage as you use them, so be wary when running out and swinging wildly.

8. If you survive the night, congrats, you have passed this part of the guide and successfully finished your first day in indev. When morning comes, be careful, because although skeletons and zombies burn up to a crisp, spiders and creepers do not. If you want to clear out the area, simply go to your options menu and momentarily set the difficulty to Peaceful, then return to your chosen difficulty.

9. Before you leave your spawnhouse, craft a cobblestone version of your chosen tools. The blueprints are the same and they work the same, but they are more efficient and last longer. The only difference is with rock pickaxes, which can mine iron and coal. Otherwise you would not get blocks from them and would waste them.

10. Venture out into the map again, and this time keep an eye out for any &quot;surface ore&quot; as it is called. There are four types of ore, and they are, in order of strength: Coal, Gold, Iron, and Diamond. If you don&#39;t find any, it&#39;d be a good time to start digging for some. If you want to start out in the open, create a shovel. Shovels mine grass, dirt, sand, and gravel faster. They also mine rock faster, but it is not recommended since it isn&#39;t much quicker and it wastes the tool&#39;s efficiency.

11. Use the cobblestone you get to build up your base when night falls again. Be careful of monsters in the caves, because, though it is daylight, it is dark, which is the only requirement for monsters to spawn. If you find coal, craft some torches so you can see (see crafting guide). If you find iron, make some iron tools. If you find diamond, leave it be, because rock pickaxes cannot mine diamond blocks. When night falls, retreat to your base and continue building it up or stay in your mine if you feel safe enough. It is recommended to carry a crafting table with you in case you run out of tools on your way out.

12. You should have enough cobblestone at this point to make a furnace. You may have noticed that you cannot use your iron ore blocks to make tools yet. This requires smelting, which is a fancy term for &quot;putting the block in a furnace for a few seconds and then getting a bar out of it&quot;. Craft a furnace (see crafting guide) and place it somewhere you think it looks good. It&#39;s best to have more than one for faster smelting, but one will do for now. Place it and right click it. Take some of your coal (or planks, if you do not have any coal) and place it in the bottom slot of the furnace. Place what you want to smelt in the top, and voila, you are smelting. The furnace will light up and will stay that way until it is finished smelting or you run out of materials.

13. When day breaks, pat yourself on the back, because you have finally finished learning all the basics of Indev. More advanced techniques will be covered in part two, but for now, have fun with it, and build as much as you like. The only limit is your imagination.

More to come later. This guide is meant for EXTREME beginners who are completely new to indev. I hope it helps someone out somewhere. :v:

It&#39;s still a work in progress so I&#39;ll be editing in some links and images and stuff eventually."

                            <span v-pre>[highlight]DOOMISH&#39;S GUIDE TO INDEV (infdev works too i guess)[/highlight]

[B]PART ONE: THE FIRST DAY OR SO[/B]

1. Pick the settings you would like. If you&#39;re good at parachuting into water out of deathly high air, go with small deep island. If otherwise, pick a different combo. The default is normal square island, which I recommend if you just want to play or are just getting started. It&#39;s all completely customizable!

2. Once you pick a map specification and start it up, congrats, you are now in indev! You start in the Spawnhouse,a wood building with plain old stone for a floor. It&#39;s got a 2x1 door so you can fit in, two torches so you can see inside it, and that&#39;s about it. Enjoy it, it&#39;ll be your home until you get it all started.

3. Before you do anything else, you need to get wood. No, that&#39;s not a euphamism for masturbation. Get three log blocks from a tree nearby and hit I. It&#39;ll open up your inventory, where you store your blocks and do simple crafting. The reason I said three blocks is because three blocks will allow you to make one crafting table, one stick pile (four sticks), which in turn will leave you enough for one axe and one pickaxe.

4. Place the log block stack in the top left corner of the crafting box in the top right of your inventory. Grab the plank blocks out of the single right box, and place four of them (right click to place individual blocks) in the left 2x2 square to make a crafting table. Take it back to your spawnhouse and place the crafting table somewhere within reach. From here, you can right click it for a larger 3x3 square.

Go to the following link for ALL the crafting recepies and what the blocks should look like to craft things: [url]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Crafting[/url]

We&#39;ll get to all of the other materials in a separate part.

5. For now, make one pile of sticks, and use the leftover planks to make an axe and a pickaxe. The axe can be used to cut log blocks faster. The pickaxe far shortens the amount of time required to break stone blocks as well as giving you a cobblestone block to place. If you are not using a pickaxe, you will not get a block at all when mining stone.

6. It&#39;s your choice what to do now. Explore your map, mine some stone, cut down some more trees, anything you want. Hell, you can go around hunting sheep and pigs if you want. I&#39;ll assume you&#39;re playing on Normal for this part, so when night falls, retreat to your base, because soon enough you&#39;ll find out why. Take an easy to break block (such as dirt or plank) and place it in the top square of the 1x2 door of your spawnhouse. That way you can hit enemies&#39; legs instead of their faces. It&#39;s safer that way, trust me.

7. Spend this time building up your spawnhouse. If you&#39;re feeling brave, venture out into the darkness and scout out an area to make a new house, though it may cost you your life, because here we are introduced to monsters.

[url=http://www.facepunch.com/showpost.php?p=22091016&amp;postcount=1678]Part one is here[/url]

[B]PART TWO: THE TOOL SPECIFICS[/B]

[B]A. CRAFTING[/B]

[url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Crafting]Remember, Crafting list is here for reference[/url]

Crafting is a nice way to say &quot;making stuff using your blocks&quot;. Here are the two crafting squares, respectively.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/88/Crafting2x2.png[/img]

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/8c/Crafting3x3.png[/img]

You can use the smaller one to make some of the two-square items such as torches and sticks in case you don&#39;t have a crafting table with you. There is not much to say other than this since the wiki article does such a good job of it. Just know what you&#39;re crafting before you put in the items so you don&#39;t craft the wrong thing by accident.

[B]B. TOOLS[/B]

Tools are created using the crafting table. They have a durability, which is the same for each tool. They all break after a certain number of uses (a use is defined as breaking any block with it), and this number is determined by the material the tool is made with. Here is how the number of uses is determined:

Wood and gold give 33 uses 
Stone gives 65 uses 
Iron gives 129 uses 
Diamond gives 257 uses

This makes it apparent why gold is probably better used for a decoration item. There is also a tier system, which is as follows:

Wood: Gets blocks from coal and stone
Gold: Gets blocks from coal and stone
Stone: Gets blocks from coal, stone, and iron
Iron: Gets blocks from coal, stone, iron, gold, and diamond
Diamond: Gets blocks from all of the above

Gold is always equal to wood, so if you craft any gold tools, using them for something other than just being able to flaunt your bling is likely a waste of materials. When you &quot;use&quot; a tool for something other than its intended purpose (like a sword for dirt or an axe for stone), it halves the number of uses the tool has left in it before it breaks. Keep this in mind and be careful when mining around animals.

Here are the tools that exist now and their uses:

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/3/39/Craftingaxeanim2.gif[/img]
[B]AXE[/B]
[B]USES:[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/4/4e/WoodAlternative96.png[/img_thumb], [img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/a/ac/Tree.png[/img][/B]
This tool&#39;s only use is chopping log blocks faster, though it also works on plank blocks. Axes break chests and crafting tables as well. It also cuts dirt faster, but not very much.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/f/f2/Craftingpickaxeanim2.gif[/img]
[B]PICKAXE[/B]
[B]USES: [img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/d/d4/Stone.png[/img], [img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/e/e2/CobblestoneAlternative96.png[/img], and all ores[/B]
Pickaxes go through stone like a fat man goes through pizza rolls. It&#39;s recommended to craft a lot of these since most of indev takes place underground. Pickaxes also break furnaces faster.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/8b/Craftingshovelanim2.gif[/img]
[B]SHOVEL[/B]
[B]USES: [img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/a/af/DirtAlternative96.png[/img][/B]
Shovels&#39; only use is cutting grass. Unfortunately, they aren&#39;t useful for much other than land carving/flattening. Shovels are like the redheaded stepchild of tools. You want to love it but it just isn&#39;t that useful when it comes down to it.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/8c/Craftingswordanim2.gif[/img]
[B]SWORD[/B]
[B]USES: Monster hunting[/B]
Swords are fairly self-explanitory. You hit things and they die. It also digs through everything else faster, but it&#39;s not really the best use of it. Each tier cuts through monsters faster than the last. Diamond will basically kill anything in one shot save for the ever-resillient spiders.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/86/Hoe.gif[/img]
[B]HOE[/B]
Hoes are used to turn dirt into soil and to collect seeds (more on this in part three). The only advantage of a higher quality hoe is that they are more durable. Unlike other tools, removing blocks with the hoe does not reduce the durability of the tool. Durability only decreases if seeds come out of the grass.

Tune in later for part three, in which monster specifics are discussed."
