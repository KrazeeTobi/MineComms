I think it should break, but only after say 2049 uses. If it was invincible then you wouldn&#39;t be forced to look for more diamond after a while, so there would be no need to mine or anything."

I guess you&#39;re right, but I agree that it should have a very high number of uses when it&#39;s so rare."

I think it should break, but only after say 2049 uses. If it was invincible then you wouldn&#39;t be forced to look for more diamond after a while, so there would be no need to mine or anything.[/QUOTE]

I guess you&#39;re right, but I agree that it should have a very high number of uses when it&#39;s so rare.</span>

Don&#39;t look into it too much.

Before the question of it breaking in use comes up, you have to ask where the character got tools for his workbench that could cut diamond (and efficiently) into tools to begin with.  Shouldn&#39;t he need a synthetic diamond or extremely hard metals?
But before you can ask that, you have to ask yourself how a guy with naught but a wood workbench made stone tools.  Didn&#39;t he need stones with which to hit other stones?
But before you can ask that, you need to ask yourself how someone makes a wood bench out of just wood.  What was he using for tools?  Did he carve it with his teeth, or make it by beating multiple pieces of wood together?
But before you can ask that, you have to ask yourself how anybody cuts planks from tree trunk without a saw.
But before that, you have to ask how someone cuts down a trunk with his hands.
And so on and so forth."

Before the question of it breaking in use comes up, you have to ask where the character got tools for his workbench that could cut diamond (and efficiently) into tools to begin with.  Shouldn&#39;t he need a synthetic diamond or extremely hard metals?
But before you can ask that, you have to ask yourself how a guy with naught but a wood workbench made stone tools.  Didn&#39;t he need stones with which to hit other stones?
But before you can ask that, you need to ask yourself how someone makes a wood bench out of just wood.  What was he using for tools?  Did he carve it with his teeth, or make it by beating multiple pieces of wood together?
But before you can ask that, you have to ask yourself how anybody cuts planks from tree trunk without a saw.

                        <postrender input="[highlight]DOOMISH&#39;S GUIDE TO INDEV (infdev works too i guess)[/highlight]

[url=http://www.facepunch.com/showpost.php?p=22093041&amp;postcount=1684]part two is here[/url]

[B]PART THREE: YOUR ADVERSARIES[/B]

This part of the guide is simple to understand. You have enemies and you hit them until either they die or you die. It&#39;s a real-time combat system, no timed hits or RPG mana or whathaveyou here. Just point at an enemy and hit them like there&#39;s no tomorrow. If you get close enough, there is some element of luck involved in whether you get hit or not, but be wary when just going Chuck Norris with your fists.

[B]A. THE ONES THAT WON&#39;T KILL YOU[/B]

There are only two mobs in the game (three if you count yourself) that won&#39;t hurt you, and they are:

[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/c/cc/Sheep.png[/img_thumb]
[B]SHEEP[/B]
[B]DROPS: WOOL, MUSHROOMS (SURVIVAL ONLY)[/B]
Sheep walk around aimlessly doing nothing in Indev. In survival, they eat grass and make the block into a dirt block, but they do not do that anymore. They possibly decided that grass is no longer tasty. When hit once, sheep drop 1-3 wool blocks, which is the Indev equivalent to cloth. There is no way to color it yet, but you can use it to make paintings (see crafting guide). Sheep are recognizable by their bleating and white color. During the night-day transition, they glow in the dark.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/4/49/Pig.jpg[/img]
[B]PIG[/B]
[B]DROPS: MUSHROOMS (SURVIVAL), PORK (INDEV)[/B]
Pigs, like sheep, are just kind of there. They don&#39;t do much except run around oinking. Killing one will provide you with pork, which you can eat to regain health. You can also cook pork to regain more health (see part 4 for furnace instruction). Pigs spawn in groups of 3-4 and have a habit of falling to their deaths. If you make your base on the underside of a cliff, you will likely be able to travel to the bottom and collect pork every so often.

[B]B. THE ONES THAT WANT TO EAT YOUR FACE[/B]

[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/a/a7/Skeleton.jpg[/img_thumb]
[B]SKELETON[/B]
[B]DROPS: ARROWS, FEATHERS, STRING, STICKS (RARE), FLINT (RARE)[/B]
Skeletons are a fierce enemy. They attack at long range, move at almost your speed, and are hard to kill with almost as many hit points as a spider. The skeleton has the ability to fire arrows. Unlike in survival, skeletons do not have any sort of inacuracy, and are guaranteed to hit you if you are standing still or running in a straight line. Killing them is fairly easy if you&#39;re good at holding D or A and clicking at the same time. If an arrow hits something the skeleton will instantly fire again, so be careful if you take an arrow to the face. Arrows do 2 hearts of damage and a melee attack does the same amount.

[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/e/e7/Zombie.jpg[/img_thumb]
[B]ZOMBIE[/B]
[B]DROPS: FLINT, FEATHERS, STRING[/B]
Zombies are a fairly easy to kill enemy in indev. They are the fastest mob in the game in survival, but thankfully it has been toned down for the new indev version. Their only attack is melee, which does 2 hearts of damage. If you can outrun them, you can kill them. Taking them out from a distance is generally recommended, but not necessary. If you get too close, it will strike you and knock you back, which makes getting away easy. Sometimes zombies can be spotted with armor, but it does not improve their health any.

[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/f/fe/Twocreepers.png[/img_thumb]
[B]CREEPER[/B]
[B]DROPS: FLINT, FEATHERS, STRING, GUNPOWDER[/B]
Creepers are about as slow as zombies, but that doesn&#39;t mean they are less dangerous. Creepers wander around in circles until they spot you, at which point they will make a beeline for you until you get out of their sight, and even then they sometimes persist. If you get close enough to a creeper, it will flash and make a hissing sound. After 3 seconds, if you don&#39;t get at least 4 squares away from it in any direction, it will explode. If you kill the creeper or get out of range, it will not explode and you will be safe. Upon exploding, it will leave a 4x4x4 spherical crater in the ground, depending on the blocks around it. Creepers do 2 hearts of damage from melee attacks and anywhere from 1-4 depending on how close you are to it when it explodes.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/84/Spider.png[/img]
NOTE: THE ABOVE IMAGE IS FROM AN EARLIER VERSION OF SURVIVAL
[B]SPIDER[/B]
[B]DROPS: FLINT, STRING, FEATHERS[/B]
Spiders are faster than you, let&#39;s get this out of the way now. You cannot outrun a spider. They can jump at least 3 tiles high and far, and deal out a ton of damage very quickly. Luckily, a spider will not pursue you if you get out of range, and its walk is a little slower than the speed of skeletons. As you can see from the image, spiders are smaller than the tall mobs like zombies and creepers, and can fit into 1x1 spaces if they are pursing you and you escape. It is not impossible for a spider to jump over you and land behind you. It is recommended to take these out from afar because direct confrontation is dangerous and also terrifying, take it from me."

                            <span v-pre>[highlight]DOOMISH&#39;S GUIDE TO INDEV (infdev works too i guess)[/highlight]

[url=http://www.facepunch.com/showpost.php?p=22093041&amp;postcount=1684]part two is here[/url]

[B]PART THREE: YOUR ADVERSARIES[/B]

This part of the guide is simple to understand. You have enemies and you hit them until either they die or you die. It&#39;s a real-time combat system, no timed hits or RPG mana or whathaveyou here. Just point at an enemy and hit them like there&#39;s no tomorrow. If you get close enough, there is some element of luck involved in whether you get hit or not, but be wary when just going Chuck Norris with your fists.

[B]A. THE ONES THAT WON&#39;T KILL YOU[/B]

There are only two mobs in the game (three if you count yourself) that won&#39;t hurt you, and they are:

[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/c/cc/Sheep.png[/img_thumb]
[B]SHEEP[/B]
[B]DROPS: WOOL, MUSHROOMS (SURVIVAL ONLY)[/B]
Sheep walk around aimlessly doing nothing in Indev. In survival, they eat grass and make the block into a dirt block, but they do not do that anymore. They possibly decided that grass is no longer tasty. When hit once, sheep drop 1-3 wool blocks, which is the Indev equivalent to cloth. There is no way to color it yet, but you can use it to make paintings (see crafting guide). Sheep are recognizable by their bleating and white color. During the night-day transition, they glow in the dark.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/4/49/Pig.jpg[/img]
[B]PIG[/B]
[B]DROPS: MUSHROOMS (SURVIVAL), PORK (INDEV)[/B]
Pigs, like sheep, are just kind of there. They don&#39;t do much except run around oinking. Killing one will provide you with pork, which you can eat to regain health. You can also cook pork to regain more health (see part 4 for furnace instruction). Pigs spawn in groups of 3-4 and have a habit of falling to their deaths. If you make your base on the underside of a cliff, you will likely be able to travel to the bottom and collect pork every so often.

[B]B. THE ONES THAT WANT TO EAT YOUR FACE[/B]

[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/a/a7/Skeleton.jpg[/img_thumb]
[B]SKELETON[/B]
[B]DROPS: ARROWS, FEATHERS, STRING, STICKS (RARE), FLINT (RARE)[/B]
Skeletons are a fierce enemy. They attack at long range, move at almost your speed, and are hard to kill with almost as many hit points as a spider. The skeleton has the ability to fire arrows. Unlike in survival, skeletons do not have any sort of inacuracy, and are guaranteed to hit you if you are standing still or running in a straight line. Killing them is fairly easy if you&#39;re good at holding D or A and clicking at the same time. If an arrow hits something the skeleton will instantly fire again, so be careful if you take an arrow to the face. Arrows do 2 hearts of damage and a melee attack does the same amount.

[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/e/e7/Zombie.jpg[/img_thumb]
[B]ZOMBIE[/B]
[B]DROPS: FLINT, FEATHERS, STRING[/B]
Zombies are a fairly easy to kill enemy in indev. They are the fastest mob in the game in survival, but thankfully it has been toned down for the new indev version. Their only attack is melee, which does 2 hearts of damage. If you can outrun them, you can kill them. Taking them out from a distance is generally recommended, but not necessary. If you get too close, it will strike you and knock you back, which makes getting away easy. Sometimes zombies can be spotted with armor, but it does not improve their health any.

[img_thumb]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/f/fe/Twocreepers.png[/img_thumb]
[B]CREEPER[/B]
[B]DROPS: FLINT, FEATHERS, STRING, GUNPOWDER[/B]
Creepers are about as slow as zombies, but that doesn&#39;t mean they are less dangerous. Creepers wander around in circles until they spot you, at which point they will make a beeline for you until you get out of their sight, and even then they sometimes persist. If you get close enough to a creeper, it will flash and make a hissing sound. After 3 seconds, if you don&#39;t get at least 4 squares away from it in any direction, it will explode. If you kill the creeper or get out of range, it will not explode and you will be safe. Upon exploding, it will leave a 4x4x4 spherical crater in the ground, depending on the blocks around it. Creepers do 2 hearts of damage from melee attacks and anywhere from 1-4 depending on how close you are to it when it explodes.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/84/Spider.png[/img]
NOTE: THE ABOVE IMAGE IS FROM AN EARLIER VERSION OF SURVIVAL
[B]SPIDER[/B]
[B]DROPS: FLINT, STRING, FEATHERS[/B]
Spiders are faster than you, let&#39;s get this out of the way now. You cannot outrun a spider. They can jump at least 3 tiles high and far, and deal out a ton of damage very quickly. Luckily, a spider will not pursue you if you get out of range, and its walk is a little slower than the speed of skeletons. As you can see from the image, spiders are smaller than the tall mobs like zombies and creepers, and can fit into 1x1 spaces if they are pursing you and you escape. It is not impossible for a spider to jump over you and land behind you. It is recommended to take these out from afar because direct confrontation is dangerous and also terrifying, take it from me.</span>
