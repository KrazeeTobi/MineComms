OY, a release! Thanks a lot, I&#39;ve been waiting!

Inspector Jones, I do measure my wealth in iron. I&#39;ve got tons of coal, and don&#39;t even need so much, after I made around 200 torches. Iron is way more rare, and still necessary for the pickaxes or minecart tracks. Redstone is abundant, too, and diamond, well...if this was the ore for measure, pretty much everyone would be a poor man."

That&#39;s not the reason it&#39;s frowned upon.

The reason it&#39;s frowned upon is that it fucks up SMP, either by sending and requesting garbage data from the server, or giving unfair advantages to the players. (Autocart, Minimap, etc)

He also dislikes the mods that bundle content from minecraft, or make a whole alternative client, due to the legal greyness of it. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s getting pissy about people beating him to new features like some people suggested."
