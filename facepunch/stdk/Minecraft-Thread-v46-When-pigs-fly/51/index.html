&quot;There&#39;s a new inmate in the local prison! The first day wasn&#39;t too stressful, and the inmate isn&#39;t unfamiliar to the workings of a correctional facility.

However, he notices something quite odd when he hangs out with fellow prisoners. Occasionally one prisoner would shout out a number, and the other prisoners would laugh. Unsure of the humor behind the numbers, the newbie asked his cell-mate what it all meant.

His cell-mate explained that the prison library only had one joke-book. Since each joke had been told so many times, and there was only one joke per page, it was just so much more efficient to say the joke&#39;s page number than to go through the effort and time of reading the setup and punchline out loud.

The newbie inmate couldn&#39;t believe that such a system was possible, so he decided to test it.

&quot;14!&quot; he shouted. To his surprise, laughter erupted among the others. &quot;An oldie, but a goodie,&quot; remarked his cell-mate. The newb was shocked that it seemed to work.

Nevertheless, he tried it again. &quot;37!&quot; The prison yard burst with laughter, with some prisoners even to the point of crying. &quot;That was a great one! You would have really liked it,&quot; said the cell-mate.

Still a bit suspicious, the newbie tried again. &quot;113!&quot; This time the whole prison laughed so hard, even the guards were rolling on the ground. This joke must have been good. It peaked the interest of the newbie inmate. &quot;Was the joke really that good?&quot; the newb asked. &quot;Oh, yes! You&#39;ll be known as the comedian from now on for that one, son!&quot; the cell-mate replied. &quot;We&#39;ve never heard that one before!&quot;&quot;"

This thread is pretty casual, and pretty much another community inside a community. I think that a simple off-topic post that provides a couple laughs can be OK.

Anyways, minecraft. As I will say again, will anyone post pictures of their cities so I can get some inspiration?"

Actually, you could host it on your dropbox then make a python script to auto change that avatar every day.



That is if it links to the image and not uploads the image.[/QUOTE]
 
The issue with that is that when you choose an avatar to use on Facepunch, it&#39;s actually uploaded to the site. This prevents people from hosting their avatars at sites like Photobucket and using up all of their bandwidth only to have it turn into a big, nasty bandwidth exceeded sign. At the same time, that prevents us from using scripts to change avatars since the site checks to make sure the file you are feeding it is indeed an acceptable image beforehand."

Curious, he follows the car and sees Daddy and Aunt Jane kissing.

Johnny finds this so exciting and can barely contain himself as he runs home and starts to tell his mother excitedly.

&quot;MOMMY, MOMMY, I WAS AT THE PLAYGROUND AND DADDY AND....&quot;

Mommy tells him to slow down, but that she wants to hear the story.

So Johnny tells her. &quot;I was at the playground and I saw Daddy&#39;s car go into the woods with Aunt Jane. I went to look and Daddy was giving Aunt Jane a big kiss, then he helped her take off her shirt, then Aunt Jane helped Daddy take his pants off, then Aunt Jane laid down on the seat, then Daddy....&quot;

At this point, Mommy cut him off and said, &quot;Johnny, this is such an interesting story, suppose you save the rest of it for supper time. I want to see the look on Daddy&#39;s face when you tell it tonight.&quot;

At the dinner table, Mommy asks Johnny to tell his story.

He describes the car into the woods, the undressing, laying down on the seat, and, &quot;Then Daddy and Aunt Jane did that same thing Mommy and Uncle Jeff used to do when Daddy was in the Army.&quot;"

                            <span v-pre>Little Johnny sees his Daddy&#39;s car passing the playground and going into the woods.

Curious, he follows the car and sees Daddy and Aunt Jane kissing.

Johnny finds this so exciting and can barely contain himself as he runs home and starts to tell his mother excitedly.

&quot;MOMMY, MOMMY, I WAS AT THE PLAYGROUND AND DADDY AND....&quot;

Mommy tells him to slow down, but that she wants to hear the story.

So Johnny tells her. &quot;I was at the playground and I saw Daddy&#39;s car go into the woods with Aunt Jane. I went to look and Daddy was giving Aunt Jane a big kiss, then he helped her take off her shirt, then Aunt Jane helped Daddy take his pants off, then Aunt Jane laid down on the seat, then Daddy....&quot;

At this point, Mommy cut him off and said, &quot;Johnny, this is such an interesting story, suppose you save the rest of it for supper time. I want to see the look on Daddy&#39;s face when you tell it tonight.&quot;

At the dinner table, Mommy asks Johnny to tell his story.

He describes the car into the woods, the undressing, laying down on the seat, and, &quot;Then Daddy and Aunt Jane did that same thing Mommy and Uncle Jeff used to do when Daddy was in the Army.&quot;</span>
