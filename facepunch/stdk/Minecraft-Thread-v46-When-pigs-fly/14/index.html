He will stop caring once he gets a proper client-side mod system in place. As it is, it has to inject code into the .jar, and can&#39;t keep proper consistency with servers due to the game not having proper in-built clientside/serverside distinctions.

Dampness on the fallow
Wading through the frigid water, shallow
For felt the time of day cried
I shelter in the home, I reside

Mind at ease, it&#39;s time to rest
Though something is not right, a forthcoming stress
I yearn to sleep, dream of that somewhere far away
Whatever is lurking outside, however, cannot stay

Torches burn with a passion, bright
I adorn myself in steel, conjuring might
With claymore in hand, I venture forth
Into the abyss of the frozen North

It freezes the toe and lays way the mind
Yet I lay motionless, in an unsavory bind
&quot;SSSSssss&quot;, does the sound it make
Feel the Earth tremor in its quake

I garner my strength to ring it through
Alas, the fog leaves me lingering, without a clue
Where it ventures, I cannot say
I still hear footsteps, I must make no delay

An apparition from unforgiven fog, does it emerge
A terrible being, the all mighty scourge
Its presence deafens the soul, and weakens the grip
Though, not a sound glides off its putrid lip

Eyes like a spear, that pierce the forlorn, night sky
Sadden me deeply, I cannot lie
Perhaps, once, he shared qualities, that of myself
Or perhaps, I&#39;m just a rogue pot that tumbled off a shelf

I felt the weight of this meeting pass
As my feet slowly sank beneath the tainted grass
I allowed it the first move, being it only fair
I&#39;m a man that lacks honor, it fell hopelessly into my snare

Expanding in stature, timing was key
I impaled the wretched beast, and did with thunderous glee
Again did it march forward, a countless soldier of war
I struck the fiend down, it drew breath no more

It vanished in a sudden puff
Somewhere out in the snow ridden bluff
Bitter triumph swallowed the air, a battle was won
I collapsed in anguish, a Faust undone

Hah! Exellent idea! And with notch&#39;s new texture pack update tomorrow... Err... Today I wouldn&#39;t have to go digging through the jar every time! 

Also, been hearing a lot of responses to my question about the facepunch iPhone app being developed, sounds awesome, I will be checking the app store often for that now, hopefully that will make my late night facepunch on iPhone time less difficult.

A great way to make portals to the nether, is to simply make a form of dirt or cobblestone (Anything easily removed will do.), pour one lava source in the bottom of it. Make water fall on the lava source, obsidian should be created in the place of the lava source. Use this technique to create the whole portal.

It works fine in the normal world, but when you&#39;re in the nether, the water simply evaporates when you use it. So to create another portal in the nether, you will have to have some mined obsidian to place.

Anyway, it is quite fun to make portals this way."

You have an example handy for some undue load a mod is giving a server?  I mean an actual, this-has-happened-to-you-or-a-friend, screencap supported example.
Regardless, though, that&#39;s the server owner&#39;s problem, not Notch&#39;s.  Moderation is a magical thing.

You have an example handy for some undue load a mod is giving a server?  I mean an actual, this-has-happened-to-you-or-a-friend, screencap supported example.
Regardless, though, that&#39;s the server owner&#39;s problem, not Notch&#39;s.  Moderation is a magical thing.
