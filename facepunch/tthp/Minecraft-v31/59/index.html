I just don&#39;t want the FP Minecraft community to go to shit because of petty drama, which seems to just keep popping up over and over, and it really pisses me off that a community with so much in common [I]just can&#39;t fucking get along for more than five seconds[/I]. The reason I keep joining arguments is because I can&#39;t stand the thought of everyone hating each other over things that are usually really stupid, and I know that if I can just get people to listen to me then they&#39;ll calm the fuck down. I try to be the neutral party, I really do, but sometimes I just have to state my point and then say take it or leave it."

Selling it on Steam would get more players, yeah, but it&#39;d be bad for the already-existing community because hundreds of thousands of people would flock to Minecraft threads and ask HOW I MAKE PICKAXE and we&#39;d have to tell them over and over and over, and it&#39;d get quite annoying after a while, but that&#39;s beside the point. Notch doesn&#39;t need Steam or VALVe to make a successful game and he&#39;s shown that himself.[/QUOTE]
