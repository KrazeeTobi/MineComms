[highlight]DOOMISH&#39;S GUIDE ON HOW TO AVOID BEING CALLED A BEGGAR![/highlight]

[b]SO, YOU WANT TO RECEIVE MINECRAFT?[/b]

First off, you must consider your reason. Just saying &quot;buy me Minecraft&quot; will not get you the game. You must put conscious effort into your reasoning. For example:

&quot;I don&#39;t have the money!&quot; is not a good excuse.

&quot;Paypal won&#39;t accept my card/I can&#39;t use Paypal in my country!&quot; is a good excuse.

[b]HAVE A GOOD REASON? LET&#39;S MOVE ON. HERE IS HOW YOU SHOULD ASK.[/b]

There are a few ways to ask for someone to buy you Minecraft. It should always include a way of payment if you can&#39;t buy it yourself. Here are two ways:

1. Buy them something on Steam

Minecraft is only 15 dollars max, and there are tons of games on Steam for around that price. Ask if there is something someone would be willing to trade for it. See if there is a way to negotiate a good price to settle on.

2. Just give them the money

Of course, this option may not be applicable if you can&#39;t use Paypal in your country, but it&#39;s still an option nonetheless. If you are desperate and have no money onhand, you could always ask with this as your reasoning, but I don&#39;t recommend it.

3. Write Minecraft on your penis

No, I&#39;m not joking. It worked once in the past.

[b]SO, HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT POSTING, YOU MAY ASK?[/b]

Here are two examples of posts, not made by actual people in the thread, but representative of the different types of mindests.

[quote=Beggar]Please buy me Minecraft, I don&#39;t have any money! It&#39;s too hot out to mow some lawns! I really want to play Survival MP with you guys![/quote]

You may have noticed the subtle difference in tone between the Beggar and the Asker. The Beggar does not offer anything in return, and wants instant gratification. Yes, he asked nicely, but it takes more than kind words to get someone to spend their valuable money on you. The Asker, on the other hand, demonstrates the previous two steps, and offers something in return without being rude about it. Neither of them were rude, in fact, quite the opposite, but there is a fine line between what people will call asking and what people will call begging, so be cautious.

[b]SO, YOU HAVE ASKED FOR SOMEONE TO BUY YOU MINECRAFT. NOW WHAT?[/b]

Now comes the hard part: Only doing it once. Asking more than once or twice at the most can be fatal to your reputation. Even if you offer something in return, some will still insist you are begging if you ask more than a few times. &quot;Repost for new page&quot; is not a reliable tactic and will get the same treatment.

If you wait it out a bit, you may get a good response, and if you are lucky, you&#39;ll have Minecraft in no time! Of course, this all only applies if you have a legitimate reason for wanting someone to buy you the game, but if you follow these tips, you will stay out of the red zone and off of the shunning list!

[highlight]DOOMISH&#39;S GUIDE ON HOW TO AVOID BEING CALLED A BEGGAR![/highlight]

[b]SO, YOU WANT TO RECEIVE MINECRAFT?[/b]

First off, you must consider your reason. Just saying &quot;buy me Minecraft&quot; will not get you the game. You must put conscious effort into your reasoning. For example:

&quot;I don&#39;t have the money!&quot; is not a good excuse.

&quot;Paypal won&#39;t accept my card/I can&#39;t use Paypal in my country!&quot; is a good excuse.

[b]HAVE A GOOD REASON? LET&#39;S MOVE ON. HERE IS HOW YOU SHOULD ASK.[/b]

There are a few ways to ask for someone to buy you Minecraft. It should always include a way of payment if you can&#39;t buy it yourself. Here are two ways:

1. Buy them something on Steam

Minecraft is only 15 dollars max, and there are tons of games on Steam for around that price. Ask if there is something someone would be willing to trade for it. See if there is a way to negotiate a good price to settle on.

2. Just give them the money

Of course, this option may not be applicable if you can&#39;t use Paypal in your country, but it&#39;s still an option nonetheless. If you are desperate and have no money onhand, you could always ask with this as your reasoning, but I don&#39;t recommend it.

3. Write Minecraft on your penis

No, I&#39;m not joking. It worked once in the past.

Yeah. This person. I&#39;m not saying names, but you can really look back if so inclined. I just want to clarify that lilcheeselad was saying something about the servers being full, and on that stream, the host/s were mistaking him for me at times. I never really complained, I did just the opposite, saying that there was no point trying to get in, and that I had stopped trying because I had my fun. The one thing I did say is how boring it was to see you type into a box for a long time while I knew that if you got in, it would likely crash and you would be kicked. I said the stream was boring once, and left. That&#39;s it. A little mistake. Even if I insulted your mother, you wouldn&#39;t need to say

Doomish, you were the one that got me into this community with Block Mesa. No matter where the wind blows, you will always be one of my best friends on the internet. Thanks.

Lilcheeselad, you have always been a great friend as well, and the fun on the servers we have had is something I will always remember about minecraft.

Nerdy, even though we got of to a bad start, things can get better, right?

Shadeaz, even though I don&#39;t see you on the forums as much, I still want to thank you for gifting me the game on New Year&#39;s Eve. That&#39;s really the big reason I&#39;m still here.

Asm, even though you have trolled a bit, I know that you have more potental. Just keep trying to be helpful, and asking polite questions. Good luck on your quest to become a respected member of the community, it will happen in time.

To the rest of you guys on the Minecraft Megathreads, thanks! You&#39;ve actually helped me thought a couple hard points in life, and are generally nicer than most of Facepunch.

And now I should just wait another year or so for Gold Member."

To the rest of you guys on the Minecraft Megathreads, thanks! You&#39;ve actually helped me thought a couple hard points in life, and are generally nicer than most of Facepunch.

And now I should just wait another year or so for Gold Member.</span>

I love you Chezhead. 
Also, I think we should have a different header for this thread.
Demonguard, I know you&#39;ll never do it, because you made the header, but I believe we could use a new one.

I love you Chezhead. 
Also, I think we should have a different header for this thread.
Demonguard, I know you&#39;ll never do it, because you made the header, but I believe we could use a new one.

I cannot stress this enough, you guys rock. If I was gay, I would love you all, but I mean that in a sense of friendliness.

Doomish, you were the one that got me into this community with Block Mesa. No matter where the wind blows, you will always be one of my best friends on the internet. Thanks.

Lilcheeselad, you have always been a great friend as well, and the fun on the servers we have had is something I will always remember about minecraft.

Nerdy, even though we got of to a bad start, things can get better, right?

Shadeaz, even though I don&#39;t see you on the forums as much, I still want to thank you for gifting me the game on New Year&#39;s Eve. That&#39;s really the big reason I&#39;m still here.

I cannot stress this enough, you guys rock. If I was gay, I would love you all, but I mean that in a sense of friendliness.

Doomish, you were the one that got me into this community with Block Mesa. No matter where the wind blows, you will always be one of my best friends on the internet. Thanks.

Lilcheeselad, you have always been a great friend as well, and the fun on the servers we have had is something I will always remember about minecraft.

Nerdy, even though we got of to a bad start, things can get better, right?

Shadeaz, even though I don&#39;t see you on the forums as much, I still want to thank you for gifting me the game on New Year&#39;s Eve. That&#39;s really the big reason I&#39;m still here.

Asm, even though you have trolled a bit, I know that you have more potental. Just keep trying to be helpful, and asking polite questions. Good luck on your quest to become a respected member of the community, it will happen in time.

To the rest of you guys on the Minecraft Megathreads, thanks! You&#39;ve actually helped me thought a couple hard points in life, and are generally nicer than most of Facepunch.

And now I should just wait another year or so for Gold Member.[/QUOTE]
