Just the other night I was awoken by what sounded like a vuvuzela in my ear, I turned to see what it was and I saw a massive fucking wasp, (shit scared of wasps here).
I left the room to go and get something to bludgeon the bastard with, I returned to find the wasp, stuck in the web, having a final showdown of fucking incredibleness with a single lone daddy long-legs spider, this spider, being the manly fucker he is, did&#39;t even paralyse the wasp. He kept spinning and spinning it into a cucoon thing for at least half an hour, it was still wriggling inside.

All the time I was watching in amazement, he finally delivered the killing blow. He has been feeding on it for 3 days now.

They can, but they aren&#39;t poisonous and have such tiny teeth that you would think it was just a static shock at worst.

People used to think that they were the deadliest spider, but were ok to people because they couldn&#39;t bite us. Mythbusters proved both parts wrong."

Well, they&#39;re not really spiders.
They&#39;re more closely related to mites.
They&#39;re completely harmless, by the way. They mostly eat worms / dead bugs / fungi / fruit / sugar.
Kinda like ants.

Luckily for Wisconsin people, we have only two poisonous spiders here, and both are EXTREMLY RARE. They are killed in winter as well, usually, so I&#39;m pretty safe.

Actually, only 5% of Black widow bites result in death, and also hey are not found in the wild! That means only one hazardous spider!

You talking about Daddy Long-Legs? There&#39;s two types: The ones you&#39;re talking about, and the spiders. The main difference is the number of body segments.[/QUOTE]

You call harvestmen Daddy Long-Legs? Weird, that&#39;s what we call the cranefly.
Yeah, I&#39;m talking about harvestmen. The ones that aren&#39;t spiders. That&#39;s what was in the video afaik.
Well, it&#39;s likely they were harvestmen as they have a tendency to form large huddles like that, and aren&#39;t most spiders solitary?

Just make a huge map. People will either get together and make a village if it is too small, and then move underground.


Or you could just do something that if you run into the need for more people, just make the map finite so chunks will stop generating."
