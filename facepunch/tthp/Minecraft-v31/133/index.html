While it&#39;s good to see him get compensated for his hard work it&#39;s reached the point where he&#39;s making more than $10,000 dollars a day, which is an incredibly excessive figure by anyone&#39;s standards. And now he wants to increase the price even more? We are looking at 26 American Dollars for a final product that is marginally more complete than what we have now. At the rate of current sales we are looking at millions of dollars in profit for an operation that adds no additional value to anyone but himself. This is magnitudes more than any other game designer makes and is in principal no different than massive salaries payed to CEOs. Do those people deserve the millions of dollars they get? Of course not. Does notch deserve millions of dollars for designing a video game? No.

While artists need to be compensated for their work (even though video game designers aren&#39;t artists), that compensation, like anyone&#39;s, should not be excessive and only enough to cover all of their needs and reasonable wants. Anything beyond that is pure capitalist greed. This is very surprising coming from a person living in an enlightened country such as Sweden. I would hope notch would come to his senses and discount the game rather than increase the price, but I know that is highly unlikely. This is simply another display of the anti-social and greedy nature that game programmers have and how they will never be accepted as real artists. Real artists would not hesitate to give away their art so that more could experience it. What notch is doing is the exact opposite, charging more as the game gets more popular. He&#39;s nothing but a robber baron now."

Of course not. Does notch deserve millions of dollars for designing a video game? No.

While artists need to be compensated for their work (even though video game designers aren&#39;t artists), that compensation, like anyone&#39;s, should not be excessive and only enough to cover all of their needs and reasonable wants.

I would hope notch would come to his senses and discount the game rather than increase the price, but I know that is highly unlikely.

Anything beyond that is pure capitalist greed. This is very surprising coming from a person living in an enlightened country such as Sweden. I would hope notch would come to his senses and discount the game rather than increase the price, but I know that is highly unlikely. This is simply another display of the anti-social and greedy nature that game programmers have and how they will never be accepted as real artists. Real artists would not hesitate to give away their art so that more could experience it. What notch is doing is the exact opposite, charging more as the game gets more popular. He&#39;s nothing but a robber baron now.[/QUOTE]

tl;dr: Baww, Notch gets money because people like his game.</span>

Interesting. It&#39;d be AWESOME if we could ride them. Gonna try this now...

Edit: Nope. :(

Also, WTF. Why do zombies still drop feathers? Shouldn&#39;t chickens do that now?

Interesting. It&#39;d be AWESOME if we could ride them. Gonna try this now...

Edit: Nope. :(

Also, WTF. Why do zombies still drop feathers? Shouldn&#39;t chickens do that now?

Edit2: Oh, both mobs do.</span>
