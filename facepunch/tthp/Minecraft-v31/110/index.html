Yeah that&#39;s just being an arsewipe, and noone will like having you on the server, and you&#39;ll end up getting banned. But to some level stealing/griefing should be allowed, but not just because YOU CAN.[/QUOTE]

Yeah of course if you just go into someones house, mop up EVERYTHING and keep doing it i see no problem with being banned, but if I break in, sneak around and take some vaulable loot and get out of there, I dont want to get banned.</span>

I find sneaking around bases and uncovering the treasures they hide fun...
and what if a bandit wants a diamond pickaxe? Diamond is VERY hard to find (i have yet to once find one in all of my minecrasft days), and no one is gonna give one to him.
So? steal it. And its not like a bandit is gonna kill you, chances are he has less equipment than you and you&#39;d kill him."
