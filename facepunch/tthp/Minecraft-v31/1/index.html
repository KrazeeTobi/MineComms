[b]Notch&#39;s Plans![/b]
From his Brocraft Stream on July 14.
Thanks to Chezhead
[code]
- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.
- Cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP!
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits!

And thats a wrap!

[release]
[b]Minecraft keeps randomly stuttering and freezing, and I can&#39;t respawn. How do I fix it?[/b]
Open your save&#39;s level.dat with NBTedit, and set the player&#39;s health to 20, and deathtime to 0.

[B]Minecraft crashes and I get an error. What do I do?[/B]
Have you tried uninstalling/re-installing java? Have you updated java?  Have you deleted minecraft.jar and ran the client to re-download it? Try  these before you ask in the thread.

If nobody knows, AND ONLY IF NOBODY KNOWS, have you e-mailed Notch?

[B]Minecraft doesn&#39;t have all the cool stuff I see in the screenshots,  like tools and bacon and creepers![/B]
You need to purchase the game to use these features. Once you have  bought the game, head on over to [URL]http://minecraft.net/game/[/URL] to play! Or  alternatively, download the client from [URL]http://minecraft.net/download.jsp[/URL]

[b]What are these creatures and what do they do?[/b]

[i]Creepers[/i] are the green things with four legs, they simply walk up do you and explode. They drop powder which can be used to make TNT along with sand.

[i]Skeletons[/i] are the walking bones you see, and they shoot arrows at you. Just strafe them and land a couple hits with your sword on them. They drop arrows.

[i]Spiders[/i] are the bane of every miner&#39;s existance. They jump really high and can usually outrun you. They are wide, however, so they have trouble getting through doorways. These drop string so you can make bows.

[i]Zombies[/i] are really not much of a threat, but can attack you from above and kill you. They drop feathers for whatever reason which are used to make arrows.

[i]Pigs[/i] are friendly creatures which give you meat when you kill them, and if you find a sattle, you can &quot;ride&quot; them.

[i]Sheep[/i] are friendly and will drop wool/cloth, which is mostly useless.

[i]Cows[/i] drop leather when killed, and leather is used to make armor. They also double as musical instruments.

[b]Odd Tips:[/b]
+ Gold is just as weak as wood, use diamond instead!
+ Placing sand directly above lava turns it into lava!
+ The simplest way to make your tower monster proof, is to have an under water entrance.
+ Saves can be found in &quot;C:\Documents and  Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\.minecraft
+ To get water to flow how you want, put the spawn so it can only go in  one direction/the directions you want, then use blocks to guide the  water. You can then delete the blocks (but not the ones around the  spawn)
+ Don&#39;t have a sword? Use an Axe! Axes are the 2nd strongest weapon against mobs! Order: Strongest - Sword, Axe, Pickaxe, Shovel, Fists - Weakest
+ When fighting spiders, go in a door-sized gap or hole in the wall, if any. Because spiders are fat 2x1x2 creatures, they cannot get through small holes!
+ Sheep, pigs, and cows can get hurt when you try to herd them, but if you want to get them somewhere without hurting them, use snowballs!
+ Snowballs are actually quite useful when fighting enemies around lava, as you can go rapid fire on them and hit them into lava!
+ If you are complaining about a lack of iron, you havn&#39;t looked enough. Do down into a deep cave as far as you can with a couple pickaxes, [b]lots[/b] of torches, 30 or so logs, 3 pork/bread, and a sword or two. Just go down as far as you can and you&#39;ll soon have iron out your ears.
+ There&#39;s a certain set distance that diamond is down, so you have to be very close to the bottom of the map to have a chance of finding it!

[b]Notch&#39;s Plans![/b]
From his Brocraft Stream on July 14.
Thanks to Chezhead
[code]
- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.
- Cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP!
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits!

And thats a wrap!

[b]Minecraft keeps randomly stuttering and freezing, and I can&#39;t respawn. How do I fix it?[/b]
Open your save&#39;s level.dat with NBTedit, and set the player&#39;s health to 20, and deathtime to 0.

[B]Minecraft crashes and I get an error. What do I do?[/B]
Have you tried uninstalling/re-installing java? Have you updated java?  Have you deleted minecraft.jar and ran the client to re-download it? Try  these before you ask in the thread.

If nobody knows, AND ONLY IF NOBODY KNOWS, have you e-mailed Notch?

[B]Minecraft doesn&#39;t have all the cool stuff I see in the screenshots,  like tools and bacon and creepers![/B]
You need to purchase the game to use these features. Once you have  bought the game, head on over to [URL]http://minecraft.net/game/[/URL] to play! Or  alternatively, download the client from [URL]http://minecraft.net/download.jsp[/URL]

[b]What are these creatures and what do they do?[/b]

[i]Creepers[/i] are the green things with four legs, they simply walk up do you and explode. They drop powder which can be used to make TNT along with sand.

[i]Skeletons[/i] are the walking bones you see, and they shoot arrows at you. Just strafe them and land a couple hits with your sword on them. They drop arrows.

[i]Spiders[/i] are the bane of every miner&#39;s existance. They jump really high and can usually outrun you. They are wide, however, so they have trouble getting through doorways. These drop string so you can make bows.

[i]Zombies[/i] are really not much of a threat, but can attack you from above and kill you. They drop feathers for whatever reason which are used to make arrows.

[i]Pigs[/i] are friendly creatures which give you meat when you kill them, and if you find a sattle, you can &quot;ride&quot; them.

[i]Sheep[/i] are friendly and will drop wool/cloth, which is mostly useless.

[i]Cows[/i] drop leather when killed, and leather is used to make armor. They also double as musical instruments.

oh and i am using no cheats at all for the glass pyramid so I have to rape beaches alot.

Rate this post gaybow if I should just focus on the glass pyramid,
Rate it Agree if I should make a underwater base,
and rate it artistic if you think I should do something else."

                            <span v-pre>Ok guys so I am working on a 100x100 glass pyramid and finally have the land flattened. However my furnaces are taking a long time and are being very gay so I might work on a small underwater base while I wait for it. Opinions?

oh and i am using no cheats at all for the glass pyramid so I have to rape beaches alot.

Rate this post gaybow if I should just focus on the glass pyramid,
Rate it Agree if I should make a underwater base,
and rate it artistic if you think I should do something else.</span>
