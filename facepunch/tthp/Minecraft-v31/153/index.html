This is going to get deep... So I dug the initial foundation. Everything would be downhill from here.

Here it is a few hours later, it has gotten much deeper.
[IMG]http://i972.photobucket.com/albums/ae201/ManningQB18/Tothecore2.png[/IMG]
Here it is almost completeted: I was about 18 blocks from the bottom at that point

And here we go, never before seen pictures of ManningQB18&#39;s incinerator!

You walk in through an elegant lava waterfall:

Needless to say, I have more stone than I know what to do with.
In total, I recieved around:
10,351 stone
1,792 Dirt
63 Redstone
9 Gold
64 Iron
A lot of Gravel
and most importantly:
2 Diamonds!"

                            <span v-pre>This is my incinerator. You may have followed my progress over the thread, but I&#39;ll post the beginning just in case.

This is going to get deep... So I dug the initial foundation. Everything would be downhill from here.

Here it is a few hours later, it has gotten much deeper.

Here it is almost completeted: I was about 18 blocks from the bottom at that point

And here we go, never before seen pictures of ManningQB18&#39;s incinerator!

You walk in through an elegant lava waterfall:

Here it is when you throw things in:

And a shot of the bottom:

Needless to say, I have more stone than I know what to do with.
In total, I recieved around:
10,351 stone
1,792 Dirt
63 Redstone
9 Gold
64 Iron
A lot of Gravel
and most importantly:
2 Diamonds!</span>

                        <postrender input="Welcome back, FP! I wrote you a fanfiction based on 13.ogg!

[QUOTE][i]The walls were cracked, mossy and filled with overgrowth from the wild vines. Brushing the moss to the side a little, he uncovered a little corner of what he assumed was a chest. Clicking the lamp on his forehead to a brighter light, he put his torch down momentarily and got to work on it, shortly before halting and bringing a recorder to his face.

&quot;Okay, huh, entry, uh, oh man, what is this, 13. Right. Thirteen.&quot; He cleared his throat and sat the recorder down on the ground.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh, I&#39;ve found the ruins. The map led me right here. 43 layers directly underneath the mining operation. Man, the guys are never gonna believe this.&quot; he laughed a little to himself, fumbling with the lock. He pulled out his pickaxe, crude, but forged of iron, and bashed it against the lock a little. He tried to lift the lid, but it wasn&#39;t going to open without a fight.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh,&quot; he continued, visibly nervous. &quot;I&#39;ve discovered that, uh, the cave&#39;s a little darker than I&#39;d expected. I only brought a few torches with me, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to find my way back though. I keep hearing...&quot; He stopped. Glanced around. There it was again, the same clacking he&#39;d heard before. The light dripping of the cave echoed off of the walls, but the sound had stopped. As soon as he started listening for it, it always stopped.

&quot;...I keep hearing things. It&#39;s just my mind going nuts on me. I&#39;ve only been down here an hour or two. Or three... God, I lost track of the time a while ago. They just kept going on and on. They-&quot; He lost his train of thought when a clattering from behind made him yelp and spin on his heels, startled. He held out his torch and looked around, the beam far less concentrated than his mining helmet. An old pile of bones sat caged in a corner, decrepit and old. Cobwebs covered the thing. Deciding to forget it for a moment, he turned back to the chest, and the recorder.

&quot;I-I-I had to break in here. My pickaxe is almost broken but if I can just find out what&#39;s in these chests, it&#39;ll be worth it. There&#39;s gotta be something good in &#39;em.&quot; He wedged the pointed end of the pickaxe into the chest and yanked as hard as he could, ripping the chest open with a loud clatter. The dull smash of the lock against the ground bounced off the walls a dozen times, before finally settling. Wiping the sweat from his brow and removing his mining gloves, he shone his torch into the chest.

&quot;M-My god, it&#39;s gold. Tons of it. I could make a dozen bricks out of all these bars. Feathers, a saddle... Hmm. Some red powder in bags, I don&#39;t know what this could be used for.&quot; He slowly became more and more excited as he rifled through the coins, old books and papers, everything. &quot;This is amazing. I wonder if there are more ruins like it nearby...&quot; A chill went down his spine as the familiar crackling and crunching noises came from behind him, but he was too far in to care about them now.

He raised up his hand to turn off his mining light when a loud [/i]shoom[i] ruptured the air. He turned around in surprise just as an arrow pierced his hand and sent him stumbling towards the wall. He flopped overtop of the chest and bashed his head on it, sending the mining helmet rolling off and into the corner, shining the light on the approaching creatures.

Skeletons. [/i]Living[i] skeletons. With bows and arrows. They creaked and groaned as they walked, bare skeletal feet smacking against solid stone again and again as they approached. Just as he was beginning to marvel at them in sheer terror, they aimed and fired again, and that was that. Two shots was all it took. One to the face, and one to the stomach. 

&quot;I can&#39;t- I can&#39;t see, I- No, please, stop!&quot; He grabbed his pickaxe and waved it wildly, trying to ward them off, but they just kept stalking slowly towards him. &quot;I-- I-&quot;

His gasps of pain were cut short, as the CD cut out about a minute and thirty seconds in. After that, silence. Then, white noise from a cave. Twenty years&#39; worth of it. A recorder on the ground and nobody to pick it up. Just the quiet dripping of stalactites and rush of water.[/i]

Steve popped the chilling CD out of the music box. He sat back down on his couch and thought about what he&#39;d just heard. Twenty years ago, that&#39;s when the CD was dated. Nobody&#39;d come across it in twenty whole years. He&#39;d taken the items from the ruins. The cage was sitting in the corner of the room, bones perfectly preserved in it. All of the items were in his own chest now, in the basement. Whatever they&#39;d done to that miner, that unknown entity, it wasn&#39;t good. They came after him for just touching their gold, Steve didn&#39;t even want to find out what would happen if they were taken altogether. He just hoped they wouldn&#39;t come for him next.

[b]explanation:[/b] 13.ogg is one of the records you can find in dungeons. It&#39;s mainly cave ambiance, but for the first half there are weird crackling noises in the background, possibly mining. At 1:05, you can hear a little bit of crumbling and then two sounds that vaguely resemble arrows. Then you can hear the clanking of bones. It goes for a little while, and then at 1:30 the sound just halts altogether. Then it just turns into cave ambiance for the rest of the song. I propose that a miner was recording a CD to document his exploits, found the ruins, and was killed by the monsters within. Of course it&#39;s just a story I wrote because I was bored, but y&#39;know, take it as you will.[/QUOTE]

Then I wrote one for cat.ogg!

[QUOTE][i]His wife loved to play the piano. She wrote beautiful compositions, into the dozens of songs. They were often written just for him, which he loved. The melodies were mixed with another sound he could never quite put his finger on, some kind of 8-bit tone from a game from the 80s. He loved her like he loved his occupation: Mining, of course. After all, what else was he going to do out here in the grassland?

Hills and mountains almost covered the sky in all directions, blurring the horizon line each day when the sun began to shine over top of them. Every morning, he would leave for the mines, and every night, he would return to a new melody, ringing softly through his ears. She always gave him that same smile, as if to say &quot;Look, look at what I&#39;ve written! Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;, and he never needed to reply because his answer was always yes. They had great chemistry, he and her, and they almost never fought about anything, save for when it was time to go visit her mother-in-law.

Of course, he didn&#39;t know what she did while he was gone. She could have slept, gazed out at the mountains, gone for a hike, or just sat at her piano writing songs. She never really told him, but it didn&#39;t matter as long as she was safe. Sometimes she&#39;d be gone at the river or someplace similar, and she&#39;d leave a note on top of the piano when she was gone.

One day, she left a CD sitting on top of the piano, along with a note that said &quot;be back soon&quot;, adorned with a small heart and her signature at the bottom right. It was labeled &quot;cat&quot;. She&#39;d always been an animal person. He didn&#39;t know how they&#39;d be able to handle an animal at their small abode, but he dismissed the thought. He put the CD in the music box and listened like he did any of her other songs. Adventurous, wonderful, melodic. He couldn&#39;t describe the sound coming through his ears, it was so pleasant.

But then, day soon turned to night, and she hadn&#39;t returned from wherever she&#39;d gone. He began to worry, not frustrated or even the slightest bit upset, but just worried. Usually she was back by nightfall, and he&#39;d heard stories of things that came in the night from his fellow miners. He hadn&#39;t believed them, of course, but as the moon rose over the mountains, panic began to rise in his throat. It was starting to get cold outside as it often did in the fall months of the year, and her coat was still on the hanger. He threw on his jacket and was out the door, but not before grabbing a sword for precautionary measures.

He ran off over the hills, trailing to her favorite spots, where she normally went. The river, the top of Mt. Notchguard, the beach. The only place he could think of that he hadn&#39;t checked was the forest. God, he hoped she hadn&#39;t gone into the forest.

He stood at the clearing before the trees began to get more dense, unsure if he wanted to continue. He hadn&#39;t brought a torch or a lamp or even his trusty mining helmet. He gritted his teeth a little, and almost turned back, but he was determined to find his wife, and continued onward.

The trees were thick. It was nearly black in front of him, as if the darkness had closed around him and swallowed him whole. His eyes darted around, looking for any sign of movement, but all he could see was the dark of night, and all he could hear was the soft plodding of his boots against the dirt. She wasn&#39;t here, he knew she wasn&#39;t here. The only thing that was in this direction was the entrance to the mine he went to every day to work.

Sighing, he shook his head and thought to himself. [/i]&#39;No, she wouldn&#39;t have gone there. It&#39;s crazy. There&#39;s nothing there but stone and soot.&#39;[i] But he wouldn&#39;t let himself turn around. Not now. Not when he&#39;d come so far. He had to find her.

The entrance to the mine was dark and wide as ever, torches still burning at the mouth of the cave like they always were. The light warmed his face as he approached. He called her name, but the only answer was the echo of his own voice, as if it were mocking him for even thinking she&#39;d have wandered this far on her own. He looked around once more, and as he was turning around to double back, he spotted her.

She was in her nightgown, long hair flowing behind her in the breeze. She was just staring at the entrance to the cave, eyes glazed over. Her arms were at her sides, goosebumps visible on the surface of her skin. She didn&#39;t move. She didn&#39;t blink. She didn&#39;t react. The only way he could even tell she was alive was the slight raising and lowering of her chest as she breathed in and out slowly.

He called her name. He shook her by the shoulders. He wrapped his hands around her face and looked her square in the eyes, but she was miles away. Lost in a trance. After a while longer of trying to bring her back to reality, he picked her up like he would cradle a child and slowly trudged back home.

He lay her down on the couch, and sat on the edge of it, running a hand through her hair. She stayed that way, cold and unmoving, for days. He tried to get her to move, talk, do something, but she wouldn&#39;t. He dragged her to the town doctor, hoping that there was something beneath the surface that he could fix.

&quot;Well,&quot; the doctor began. &quot;After emotional trauma, the person who experienced it can become like your wife, here.&quot; He continued to look her over, lifting her arm and watching it fall limply back to her side. She stared at her knees as if she were a lifeless doll. &quot;They lose all will to live, become like a zombie.&quot;

&quot;She hasn&#39;t gone through any trauma, doctor.&quot; He replied in earnest. &quot;She&#39;s been perfectly happy. I know she has. She wrote a song for me just the other day.&quot;

&quot;It seems recent,&quot; the doctor said, practically ignoring him, &quot;It probably happened when you weren&#39;t around. Has she told you anything she&#39;s seen the past few days?&quot;

&quot;No. She hasn&#39;t said a single word since I found her at the mine entrance a while ago.&quot;

&quot;The mine entrance, you say? Hmm...&quot; The doctor thought for a minute. &quot;Fear can instill this, sort of, mind numbing feeling in a person. If anything extremely frightening&#39;s happened to your wife, here, it means she was literally scared stiff.&quot;

&quot;Wh-Well, what can we do about it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to keep her here for a few days. Maybe check up on her, see how her vitals are. If we&#39;re lucky we can get her to talk again.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; He thanked the doctor, and was guided out by his assistant. He went back to his home, nothing else to do. He contemplated the situation. Something at the mine scared his wife, so badly that she couldn&#39;t move, talk, or even think about it. He had to go find whatever it was.

He hurriedly grabbed his jacket, a pickaxe, and his mining helmet. On the way out he stuffed a few CDs into his pocket and his trusty recorder. He&#39;d document it, and he&#39;d find whatever it was, and play it back to his wife. He grabbed &quot;Cat&quot; from the music box and took it as well, in case he needed something to keep him determined.

As he neared the mine entrance, he held his pickaxe under his arm and pulled out his recorder.

&quot;Entry twelve,&quot; he began. It was the twelfth entry on that CD, they only held 15 different bits of audio, and were used often by the mining crew to document what they found while they were digging. &quot;I&#39;m going into the caves alone. I took a map, a pickaxe, and that&#39;s it. Hopefully I can get out of here before nightfall. I need to find whatever it was that frightened my wife. I [/i]need to[i].&quot; He shut off the recorder and put it away, preserving the battery until later. He took the first step down into the cave. He knew he shouldn&#39;t be going in alone. He knew he should have told someone where he went. His curiosity was surely getting the best of him. But, you know what they say.

Curiosity killed the cat.[/i][/QUOTE]

                            <span v-pre>Welcome back, FP! I wrote you a fanfiction based on 13.ogg!

[QUOTE][i]The walls were cracked, mossy and filled with overgrowth from the wild vines. Brushing the moss to the side a little, he uncovered a little corner of what he assumed was a chest. Clicking the lamp on his forehead to a brighter light, he put his torch down momentarily and got to work on it, shortly before halting and bringing a recorder to his face.

&quot;Okay, huh, entry, uh, oh man, what is this, 13. Right. Thirteen.&quot; He cleared his throat and sat the recorder down on the ground.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh, I&#39;ve found the ruins. The map led me right here. 43 layers directly underneath the mining operation. Man, the guys are never gonna believe this.&quot; he laughed a little to himself, fumbling with the lock. He pulled out his pickaxe, crude, but forged of iron, and bashed it against the lock a little. He tried to lift the lid, but it wasn&#39;t going to open without a fight.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh,&quot; he continued, visibly nervous. &quot;I&#39;ve discovered that, uh, the cave&#39;s a little darker than I&#39;d expected. I only brought a few torches with me, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to find my way back though. I keep hearing...&quot; He stopped. Glanced around. There it was again, the same clacking he&#39;d heard before. The light dripping of the cave echoed off of the walls, but the sound had stopped. As soon as he started listening for it, it always stopped.

&quot;...I keep hearing things. It&#39;s just my mind going nuts on me. I&#39;ve only been down here an hour or two. Or three... God, I lost track of the time a while ago. They just kept going on and on. They-&quot; He lost his train of thought when a clattering from behind made him yelp and spin on his heels, startled. He held out his torch and looked around, the beam far less concentrated than his mining helmet. An old pile of bones sat caged in a corner, decrepit and old. Cobwebs covered the thing. Deciding to forget it for a moment, he turned back to the chest, and the recorder.

&quot;I-I-I had to break in here. My pickaxe is almost broken but if I can just find out what&#39;s in these chests, it&#39;ll be worth it. There&#39;s gotta be something good in &#39;em.&quot; He wedged the pointed end of the pickaxe into the chest and yanked as hard as he could, ripping the chest open with a loud clatter. The dull smash of the lock against the ground bounced off the walls a dozen times, before finally settling. Wiping the sweat from his brow and removing his mining gloves, he shone his torch into the chest.

&quot;M-My god, it&#39;s gold. Tons of it. I could make a dozen bricks out of all these bars. Feathers, a saddle... Hmm. Some red powder in bags, I don&#39;t know what this could be used for.&quot; He slowly became more and more excited as he rifled through the coins, old books and papers, everything. &quot;This is amazing. I wonder if there are more ruins like it nearby...&quot; A chill went down his spine as the familiar crackling and crunching noises came from behind him, but he was too far in to care about them now.

He raised up his hand to turn off his mining light when a loud [/i]shoom[i] ruptured the air. He turned around in surprise just as an arrow pierced his hand and sent him stumbling towards the wall. He flopped overtop of the chest and bashed his head on it, sending the mining helmet rolling off and into the corner, shining the light on the approaching creatures.

Skeletons. [/i]Living[i] skeletons. With bows and arrows. They creaked and groaned as they walked, bare skeletal feet smacking against solid stone again and again as they approached. Just as he was beginning to marvel at them in sheer terror, they aimed and fired again, and that was that. Two shots was all it took. One to the face, and one to the stomach. 

&quot;I can&#39;t- I can&#39;t see, I- No, please, stop!&quot; He grabbed his pickaxe and waved it wildly, trying to ward them off, but they just kept stalking slowly towards him. &quot;I-- I-&quot;

His gasps of pain were cut short, as the CD cut out about a minute and thirty seconds in. After that, silence. Then, white noise from a cave. Twenty years&#39; worth of it. A recorder on the ground and nobody to pick it up. Just the quiet dripping of stalactites and rush of water.[/i]

Steve popped the chilling CD out of the music box. He sat back down on his couch and thought about what he&#39;d just heard. Twenty years ago, that&#39;s when the CD was dated. Nobody&#39;d come across it in twenty whole years. He&#39;d taken the items from the ruins. The cage was sitting in the corner of the room, bones perfectly preserved in it. All of the items were in his own chest now, in the basement. Whatever they&#39;d done to that miner, that unknown entity, it wasn&#39;t good. They came after him for just touching their gold, Steve didn&#39;t even want to find out what would happen if they were taken altogether. He just hoped they wouldn&#39;t come for him next.

[b]explanation:[/b] 13.ogg is one of the records you can find in dungeons. It&#39;s mainly cave ambiance, but for the first half there are weird crackling noises in the background, possibly mining. At 1:05, you can hear a little bit of crumbling and then two sounds that vaguely resemble arrows. Then you can hear the clanking of bones. It goes for a little while, and then at 1:30 the sound just halts altogether. Then it just turns into cave ambiance for the rest of the song. I propose that a miner was recording a CD to document his exploits, found the ruins, and was killed by the monsters within. Of course it&#39;s just a story I wrote because I was bored, but y&#39;know, take it as you will.[/QUOTE]

Then I wrote one for cat.ogg!

[QUOTE][i]His wife loved to play the piano. She wrote beautiful compositions, into the dozens of songs. They were often written just for him, which he loved. The melodies were mixed with another sound he could never quite put his finger on, some kind of 8-bit tone from a game from the 80s. He loved her like he loved his occupation: Mining, of course. After all, what else was he going to do out here in the grassland?

Hills and mountains almost covered the sky in all directions, blurring the horizon line each day when the sun began to shine over top of them. Every morning, he would leave for the mines, and every night, he would return to a new melody, ringing softly through his ears. She always gave him that same smile, as if to say &quot;Look, look at what I&#39;ve written! Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;, and he never needed to reply because his answer was always yes. They had great chemistry, he and her, and they almost never fought about anything, save for when it was time to go visit her mother-in-law.

Of course, he didn&#39;t know what she did while he was gone. She could have slept, gazed out at the mountains, gone for a hike, or just sat at her piano writing songs. She never really told him, but it didn&#39;t matter as long as she was safe. Sometimes she&#39;d be gone at the river or someplace similar, and she&#39;d leave a note on top of the piano when she was gone.

One day, she left a CD sitting on top of the piano, along with a note that said &quot;be back soon&quot;, adorned with a small heart and her signature at the bottom right. It was labeled &quot;cat&quot;. She&#39;d always been an animal person. He didn&#39;t know how they&#39;d be able to handle an animal at their small abode, but he dismissed the thought. He put the CD in the music box and listened like he did any of her other songs. Adventurous, wonderful, melodic. He couldn&#39;t describe the sound coming through his ears, it was so pleasant.

But then, day soon turned to night, and she hadn&#39;t returned from wherever she&#39;d gone. He began to worry, not frustrated or even the slightest bit upset, but just worried. Usually she was back by nightfall, and he&#39;d heard stories of things that came in the night from his fellow miners. He hadn&#39;t believed them, of course, but as the moon rose over the mountains, panic began to rise in his throat. It was starting to get cold outside as it often did in the fall months of the year, and her coat was still on the hanger. He threw on his jacket and was out the door, but not before grabbing a sword for precautionary measures.

He ran off over the hills, trailing to her favorite spots, where she normally went. The river, the top of Mt. Notchguard, the beach. The only place he could think of that he hadn&#39;t checked was the forest. God, he hoped she hadn&#39;t gone into the forest.

He stood at the clearing before the trees began to get more dense, unsure if he wanted to continue. He hadn&#39;t brought a torch or a lamp or even his trusty mining helmet. He gritted his teeth a little, and almost turned back, but he was determined to find his wife, and continued onward.

The trees were thick. It was nearly black in front of him, as if the darkness had closed around him and swallowed him whole. His eyes darted around, looking for any sign of movement, but all he could see was the dark of night, and all he could hear was the soft plodding of his boots against the dirt. She wasn&#39;t here, he knew she wasn&#39;t here. The only thing that was in this direction was the entrance to the mine he went to every day to work.

Sighing, he shook his head and thought to himself. [/i]&#39;No, she wouldn&#39;t have gone there. It&#39;s crazy. There&#39;s nothing there but stone and soot.&#39;[i] But he wouldn&#39;t let himself turn around. Not now. Not when he&#39;d come so far. He had to find her.

                        <postrender input="Repost for lol bottom of the page and it&#39;s a long series of paragraphs:

Welcome back, FP! I wrote you a fanfiction based on 13.ogg!

[QUOTE][i]The walls were cracked, mossy and filled with overgrowth from the wild vines. Brushing the moss to the side a little, he uncovered a little corner of what he assumed was a chest. Clicking the lamp on his forehead to a brighter light, he put his torch down momentarily and got to work on it, shortly before halting and bringing a recorder to his face.

&quot;Okay, huh, entry, uh, oh man, what is this, 13. Right. Thirteen.&quot; He cleared his throat and sat the recorder down on the ground.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh, I&#39;ve found the ruins. The map led me right here. 43 layers directly underneath the mining operation. Man, the guys are never gonna believe this.&quot; he laughed a little to himself, fumbling with the lock. He pulled out his pickaxe, crude, but forged of iron, and bashed it against the lock a little. He tried to lift the lid, but it wasn&#39;t going to open without a fight.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh,&quot; he continued, visibly nervous. &quot;I&#39;ve discovered that, uh, the cave&#39;s a little darker than I&#39;d expected. I only brought a few torches with me, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to find my way back though. I keep hearing...&quot; He stopped. Glanced around. There it was again, the same clacking he&#39;d heard before. The light dripping of the cave echoed off of the walls, but the sound had stopped. As soon as he started listening for it, it always stopped.

&quot;...I keep hearing things. It&#39;s just my mind going nuts on me. I&#39;ve only been down here an hour or two. Or three... God, I lost track of the time a while ago. They just kept going on and on. They-&quot; He lost his train of thought when a clattering from behind made him yelp and spin on his heels, startled. He held out his torch and looked around, the beam far less concentrated than his mining helmet. An old pile of bones sat caged in a corner, decrepit and old. Cobwebs covered the thing. Deciding to forget it for a moment, he turned back to the chest, and the recorder.

&quot;I-I-I had to break in here. My pickaxe is almost broken but if I can just find out what&#39;s in these chests, it&#39;ll be worth it. There&#39;s gotta be something good in &#39;em.&quot; He wedged the pointed end of the pickaxe into the chest and yanked as hard as he could, ripping the chest open with a loud clatter. The dull smash of the lock against the ground bounced off the walls a dozen times, before finally settling. Wiping the sweat from his brow and removing his mining gloves, he shone his torch into the chest.

&quot;M-My god, it&#39;s gold. Tons of it. I could make a dozen bricks out of all these bars. Feathers, a saddle... Hmm. Some red powder in bags, I don&#39;t know what this could be used for.&quot; He slowly became more and more excited as he rifled through the coins, old books and papers, everything. &quot;This is amazing. I wonder if there are more ruins like it nearby...&quot; A chill went down his spine as the familiar crackling and crunching noises came from behind him, but he was too far in to care about them now.

He raised up his hand to turn off his mining light when a loud [/i]shoom[i] ruptured the air. He turned around in surprise just as an arrow pierced his hand and sent him stumbling towards the wall. He flopped overtop of the chest and bashed his head on it, sending the mining helmet rolling off and into the corner, shining the light on the approaching creatures.

Skeletons. [/i]Living[i] skeletons. With bows and arrows. They creaked and groaned as they walked, bare skeletal feet smacking against solid stone again and again as they approached. Just as he was beginning to marvel at them in sheer terror, they aimed and fired again, and that was that. Two shots was all it took. One to the face, and one to the stomach. 

&quot;I can&#39;t- I can&#39;t see, I- No, please, stop!&quot; He grabbed his pickaxe and waved it wildly, trying to ward them off, but they just kept stalking slowly towards him. &quot;I-- I-&quot;

His gasps of pain were cut short, as the CD cut out about a minute and thirty seconds in. After that, silence. Then, white noise from a cave. Twenty years&#39; worth of it. A recorder on the ground and nobody to pick it up. Just the quiet dripping of stalactites and rush of water.[/i]

Steve popped the chilling CD out of the music box. He sat back down on his couch and thought about what he&#39;d just heard. Twenty years ago, that&#39;s when the CD was dated. Nobody&#39;d come across it in twenty whole years. He&#39;d taken the items from the ruins. The cage was sitting in the corner of the room, bones perfectly preserved in it. All of the items were in his own chest now, in the basement. Whatever they&#39;d done to that miner, that unknown entity, it wasn&#39;t good. They came after him for just touching their gold, Steve didn&#39;t even want to find out what would happen if they were taken altogether. He just hoped they wouldn&#39;t come for him next.

[b]explanation:[/b] 13.ogg is one of the records you can find in dungeons. It&#39;s mainly cave ambiance, but for the first half there are weird crackling noises in the background, possibly mining. At 1:05, you can hear a little bit of crumbling and then two sounds that vaguely resemble arrows. Then you can hear the clanking of bones. It goes for a little while, and then at 1:30 the sound just halts altogether. Then it just turns into cave ambiance for the rest of the song. I propose that a miner was recording a CD to document his exploits, found the ruins, and was killed by the monsters within. Of course it&#39;s just a story I wrote because I was bored, but y&#39;know, take it as you will.[/QUOTE]

Then I wrote one for cat.ogg!

[QUOTE][i]His wife loved to play the piano. She wrote beautiful compositions, into the dozens of songs. They were often written just for him, which he loved. The melodies were mixed with another sound he could never quite put his finger on, some kind of 8-bit tone from a game from the 80s. He loved her like he loved his occupation: Mining, of course. After all, what else was he going to do out here in the grassland?

Hills and mountains almost covered the sky in all directions, blurring the horizon line each day when the sun began to shine over top of them. Every morning, he would leave for the mines, and every night, he would return to a new melody, ringing softly through his ears. She always gave him that same smile, as if to say &quot;Look, look at what I&#39;ve written! Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;, and he never needed to reply because his answer was always yes. They had great chemistry, he and her, and they almost never fought about anything, save for when it was time to go visit her mother-in-law.

Of course, he didn&#39;t know what she did while he was gone. She could have slept, gazed out at the mountains, gone for a hike, or just sat at her piano writing songs. She never really told him, but it didn&#39;t matter as long as she was safe. Sometimes she&#39;d be gone at the river or someplace similar, and she&#39;d leave a note on top of the piano when she was gone.

One day, she left a CD sitting on top of the piano, along with a note that said &quot;be back soon&quot;, adorned with a small heart and her signature at the bottom right. It was labeled &quot;cat&quot;. She&#39;d always been an animal person. He didn&#39;t know how they&#39;d be able to handle an animal at their small abode, but he dismissed the thought. He put the CD in the music box and listened like he did any of her other songs. Adventurous, wonderful, melodic. He couldn&#39;t describe the sound coming through his ears, it was so pleasant.

But then, day soon turned to night, and she hadn&#39;t returned from wherever she&#39;d gone. He began to worry, not frustrated or even the slightest bit upset, but just worried. Usually she was back by nightfall, and he&#39;d heard stories of things that came in the night from his fellow miners. He hadn&#39;t believed them, of course, but as the moon rose over the mountains, panic began to rise in his throat. It was starting to get cold outside as it often did in the fall months of the year, and her coat was still on the hanger. He threw on his jacket and was out the door, but not before grabbing a sword for precautionary measures.

He ran off over the hills, trailing to her favorite spots, where she normally went. The river, the top of Mt. Notchguard, the beach. The only place he could think of that he hadn&#39;t checked was the forest. God, he hoped she hadn&#39;t gone into the forest.

He stood at the clearing before the trees began to get more dense, unsure if he wanted to continue. He hadn&#39;t brought a torch or a lamp or even his trusty mining helmet. He gritted his teeth a little, and almost turned back, but he was determined to find his wife, and continued onward.

The trees were thick. It was nearly black in front of him, as if the darkness had closed around him and swallowed him whole. His eyes darted around, looking for any sign of movement, but all he could see was the dark of night, and all he could hear was the soft plodding of his boots against the dirt. She wasn&#39;t here, he knew she wasn&#39;t here. The only thing that was in this direction was the entrance to the mine he went to every day to work.

Sighing, he shook his head and thought to himself. [/i]&#39;No, she wouldn&#39;t have gone there. It&#39;s crazy. There&#39;s nothing there but stone and soot.&#39;[i] But he wouldn&#39;t let himself turn around. Not now. Not when he&#39;d come so far. He had to find her.

The entrance to the mine was dark and wide as ever, torches still burning at the mouth of the cave like they always were. The light warmed his face as he approached. He called her name, but the only answer was the echo of his own voice, as if it were mocking him for even thinking she&#39;d have wandered this far on her own. He looked around once more, and as he was turning around to double back, he spotted her.

She was in her nightgown, long hair flowing behind her in the breeze. She was just staring at the entrance to the cave, eyes glazed over. Her arms were at her sides, goosebumps visible on the surface of her skin. She didn&#39;t move. She didn&#39;t blink. She didn&#39;t react. The only way he could even tell she was alive was the slight raising and lowering of her chest as she breathed in and out slowly.

He called her name. He shook her by the shoulders. He wrapped his hands around her face and looked her square in the eyes, but she was miles away. Lost in a trance. After a while longer of trying to bring her back to reality, he picked her up like he would cradle a child and slowly trudged back home.

He lay her down on the couch, and sat on the edge of it, running a hand through her hair. She stayed that way, cold and unmoving, for days. He tried to get her to move, talk, do something, but she wouldn&#39;t. He dragged her to the town doctor, hoping that there was something beneath the surface that he could fix.

&quot;Well,&quot; the doctor began. &quot;After emotional trauma, the person who experienced it can become like your wife, here.&quot; He continued to look her over, lifting her arm and watching it fall limply back to her side. She stared at her knees as if she were a lifeless doll. &quot;They lose all will to live, become like a zombie.&quot;

&quot;She hasn&#39;t gone through any trauma, doctor.&quot; He replied in earnest. &quot;She&#39;s been perfectly happy. I know she has. She wrote a song for me just the other day.&quot;

&quot;It seems recent,&quot; the doctor said, practically ignoring him, &quot;It probably happened when you weren&#39;t around. Has she told you anything she&#39;s seen the past few days?&quot;

&quot;No. She hasn&#39;t said a single word since I found her at the mine entrance a while ago.&quot;

&quot;The mine entrance, you say? Hmm...&quot; The doctor thought for a minute. &quot;Fear can instill this, sort of, mind numbing feeling in a person. If anything extremely frightening&#39;s happened to your wife, here, it means she was literally scared stiff.&quot;

&quot;Wh-Well, what can we do about it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to keep her here for a few days. Maybe check up on her, see how her vitals are. If we&#39;re lucky we can get her to talk again.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; He thanked the doctor, and was guided out by his assistant. He went back to his home, nothing else to do. He contemplated the situation. Something at the mine scared his wife, so badly that she couldn&#39;t move, talk, or even think about it. He had to go find whatever it was.

He hurriedly grabbed his jacket, a pickaxe, and his mining helmet. On the way out he stuffed a few CDs into his pocket and his trusty recorder. He&#39;d document it, and he&#39;d find whatever it was, and play it back to his wife. He grabbed &quot;Cat&quot; from the music box and took it as well, in case he needed something to keep him determined.

As he neared the mine entrance, he held his pickaxe under his arm and pulled out his recorder.

&quot;Entry twelve,&quot; he began. It was the twelfth entry on that CD, they only held 15 different bits of audio, and were used often by the mining crew to document what they found while they were digging. &quot;I&#39;m going into the caves alone. I took a map, a pickaxe, and that&#39;s it. Hopefully I can get out of here before nightfall. I need to find whatever it was that frightened my wife. I [/i]need to[i].&quot; He shut off the recorder and put it away, preserving the battery until later. He took the first step down into the cave. He knew he shouldn&#39;t be going in alone. He knew he should have told someone where he went. His curiosity was surely getting the best of him. But, you know what they say.

Curiosity killed the cat.[/i][/QUOTE]

                            <span v-pre>Repost for lol bottom of the page and it&#39;s a long series of paragraphs:

Welcome back, FP! I wrote you a fanfiction based on 13.ogg!

[QUOTE][i]The walls were cracked, mossy and filled with overgrowth from the wild vines. Brushing the moss to the side a little, he uncovered a little corner of what he assumed was a chest. Clicking the lamp on his forehead to a brighter light, he put his torch down momentarily and got to work on it, shortly before halting and bringing a recorder to his face.

&quot;Okay, huh, entry, uh, oh man, what is this, 13. Right. Thirteen.&quot; He cleared his throat and sat the recorder down on the ground.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh, I&#39;ve found the ruins. The map led me right here. 43 layers directly underneath the mining operation. Man, the guys are never gonna believe this.&quot; he laughed a little to himself, fumbling with the lock. He pulled out his pickaxe, crude, but forged of iron, and bashed it against the lock a little. He tried to lift the lid, but it wasn&#39;t going to open without a fight.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh,&quot; he continued, visibly nervous. &quot;I&#39;ve discovered that, uh, the cave&#39;s a little darker than I&#39;d expected. I only brought a few torches with me, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be able to find my way back though. I keep hearing...&quot; He stopped. Glanced around. There it was again, the same clacking he&#39;d heard before. The light dripping of the cave echoed off of the walls, but the sound had stopped. As soon as he started listening for it, it always stopped.

&quot;...I keep hearing things. It&#39;s just my mind going nuts on me. I&#39;ve only been down here an hour or two. Or three... God, I lost track of the time a while ago. They just kept going on and on. They-&quot; He lost his train of thought when a clattering from behind made him yelp and spin on his heels, startled. He held out his torch and looked around, the beam far less concentrated than his mining helmet. An old pile of bones sat caged in a corner, decrepit and old. Cobwebs covered the thing. Deciding to forget it for a moment, he turned back to the chest, and the recorder.

&quot;I-I-I had to break in here. My pickaxe is almost broken but if I can just find out what&#39;s in these chests, it&#39;ll be worth it. There&#39;s gotta be something good in &#39;em.&quot; He wedged the pointed end of the pickaxe into the chest and yanked as hard as he could, ripping the chest open with a loud clatter. The dull smash of the lock against the ground bounced off the walls a dozen times, before finally settling. Wiping the sweat from his brow and removing his mining gloves, he shone his torch into the chest.

&quot;M-My god, it&#39;s gold. Tons of it. I could make a dozen bricks out of all these bars. Feathers, a saddle... Hmm. Some red powder in bags, I don&#39;t know what this could be used for.&quot; He slowly became more and more excited as he rifled through the coins, old books and papers, everything. &quot;This is amazing. I wonder if there are more ruins like it nearby...&quot; A chill went down his spine as the familiar crackling and crunching noises came from behind him, but he was too far in to care about them now.

He raised up his hand to turn off his mining light when a loud [/i]shoom[i] ruptured the air. He turned around in surprise just as an arrow pierced his hand and sent him stumbling towards the wall. He flopped overtop of the chest and bashed his head on it, sending the mining helmet rolling off and into the corner, shining the light on the approaching creatures.

Skeletons. [/i]Living[i] skeletons. With bows and arrows. They creaked and groaned as they walked, bare skeletal feet smacking against solid stone again and again as they approached. Just as he was beginning to marvel at them in sheer terror, they aimed and fired again, and that was that. Two shots was all it took. One to the face, and one to the stomach. 

&quot;I can&#39;t- I can&#39;t see, I- No, please, stop!&quot; He grabbed his pickaxe and waved it wildly, trying to ward them off, but they just kept stalking slowly towards him. &quot;I-- I-&quot;

His gasps of pain were cut short, as the CD cut out about a minute and thirty seconds in. After that, silence. Then, white noise from a cave. Twenty years&#39; worth of it. A recorder on the ground and nobody to pick it up. Just the quiet dripping of stalactites and rush of water.[/i]

Steve popped the chilling CD out of the music box. He sat back down on his couch and thought about what he&#39;d just heard. Twenty years ago, that&#39;s when the CD was dated. Nobody&#39;d come across it in twenty whole years. He&#39;d taken the items from the ruins. The cage was sitting in the corner of the room, bones perfectly preserved in it. All of the items were in his own chest now, in the basement. Whatever they&#39;d done to that miner, that unknown entity, it wasn&#39;t good. They came after him for just touching their gold, Steve didn&#39;t even want to find out what would happen if they were taken altogether. He just hoped they wouldn&#39;t come for him next.

[b]explanation:[/b] 13.ogg is one of the records you can find in dungeons. It&#39;s mainly cave ambiance, but for the first half there are weird crackling noises in the background, possibly mining. At 1:05, you can hear a little bit of crumbling and then two sounds that vaguely resemble arrows. Then you can hear the clanking of bones. It goes for a little while, and then at 1:30 the sound just halts altogether. Then it just turns into cave ambiance for the rest of the song. I propose that a miner was recording a CD to document his exploits, found the ruins, and was killed by the monsters within. Of course it&#39;s just a story I wrote because I was bored, but y&#39;know, take it as you will.[/QUOTE]

Then I wrote one for cat.ogg!

[QUOTE][i]His wife loved to play the piano. She wrote beautiful compositions, into the dozens of songs. They were often written just for him, which he loved. The melodies were mixed with another sound he could never quite put his finger on, some kind of 8-bit tone from a game from the 80s. He loved her like he loved his occupation: Mining, of course. After all, what else was he going to do out here in the grassland?

Hills and mountains almost covered the sky in all directions, blurring the horizon line each day when the sun began to shine over top of them. Every morning, he would leave for the mines, and every night, he would return to a new melody, ringing softly through his ears. She always gave him that same smile, as if to say &quot;Look, look at what I&#39;ve written! Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&quot;, and he never needed to reply because his answer was always yes. They had great chemistry, he and her, and they almost never fought about anything, save for when it was time to go visit her mother-in-law.

Of course, he didn&#39;t know what she did while he was gone. She could have slept, gazed out at the mountains, gone for a hike, or just sat at her piano writing songs. She never really told him, but it didn&#39;t matter as long as she was safe. Sometimes she&#39;d be gone at the river or someplace similar, and she&#39;d leave a note on top of the piano when she was gone.

One day, she left a CD sitting on top of the piano, along with a note that said &quot;be back soon&quot;, adorned with a small heart and her signature at the bottom right. It was labeled &quot;cat&quot;. She&#39;d always been an animal person. He didn&#39;t know how they&#39;d be able to handle an animal at their small abode, but he dismissed the thought. He put the CD in the music box and listened like he did any of her other songs. Adventurous, wonderful, melodic. He couldn&#39;t describe the sound coming through his ears, it was so pleasant.

But then, day soon turned to night, and she hadn&#39;t returned from wherever she&#39;d gone. He began to worry, not frustrated or even the slightest bit upset, but just worried. Usually she was back by nightfall, and he&#39;d heard stories of things that came in the night from his fellow miners. He hadn&#39;t believed them, of course, but as the moon rose over the mountains, panic began to rise in his throat. It was starting to get cold outside as it often did in the fall months of the year, and her coat was still on the hanger. He threw on his jacket and was out the door, but not before grabbing a sword for precautionary measures.

He ran off over the hills, trailing to her favorite spots, where she normally went. The river, the top of Mt. Notchguard, the beach. The only place he could think of that he hadn&#39;t checked was the forest. God, he hoped she hadn&#39;t gone into the forest.

He stood at the clearing before the trees began to get more dense, unsure if he wanted to continue. He hadn&#39;t brought a torch or a lamp or even his trusty mining helmet. He gritted his teeth a little, and almost turned back, but he was determined to find his wife, and continued onward.

The trees were thick. It was nearly black in front of him, as if the darkness had closed around him and swallowed him whole. His eyes darted around, looking for any sign of movement, but all he could see was the dark of night, and all he could hear was the soft plodding of his boots against the dirt. She wasn&#39;t here, he knew she wasn&#39;t here. The only thing that was in this direction was the entrance to the mine he went to every day to work.

Sighing, he shook his head and thought to himself. [/i]&#39;No, she wouldn&#39;t have gone there. It&#39;s crazy. There&#39;s nothing there but stone and soot.&#39;[i] But he wouldn&#39;t let himself turn around. Not now. Not when he&#39;d come so far. He had to find her.

The entrance to the mine was dark and wide as ever, torches still burning at the mouth of the cave like they always were. The light warmed his face as he approached. He called her name, but the only answer was the echo of his own voice, as if it were mocking him for even thinking she&#39;d have wandered this far on her own. He looked around once more, and as he was turning around to double back, he spotted her.

She was in her nightgown, long hair flowing behind her in the breeze. She was just staring at the entrance to the cave, eyes glazed over. Her arms were at her sides, goosebumps visible on the surface of her skin. She didn&#39;t move. She didn&#39;t blink. She didn&#39;t react. The only way he could even tell she was alive was the slight raising and lowering of her chest as she breathed in and out slowly.

He called her name. He shook her by the shoulders. He wrapped his hands around her face and looked her square in the eyes, but she was miles away. Lost in a trance. After a while longer of trying to bring her back to reality, he picked her up like he would cradle a child and slowly trudged back home.

He lay her down on the couch, and sat on the edge of it, running a hand through her hair. She stayed that way, cold and unmoving, for days. He tried to get her to move, talk, do something, but she wouldn&#39;t. He dragged her to the town doctor, hoping that there was something beneath the surface that he could fix.

&quot;Well,&quot; the doctor began. &quot;After emotional trauma, the person who experienced it can become like your wife, here.&quot; He continued to look her over, lifting her arm and watching it fall limply back to her side. She stared at her knees as if she were a lifeless doll. &quot;They lose all will to live, become like a zombie.&quot;

&quot;She hasn&#39;t gone through any trauma, doctor.&quot; He replied in earnest. &quot;She&#39;s been perfectly happy. I know she has. She wrote a song for me just the other day.&quot;

&quot;It seems recent,&quot; the doctor said, practically ignoring him, &quot;It probably happened when you weren&#39;t around. Has she told you anything she&#39;s seen the past few days?&quot;

&quot;No. She hasn&#39;t said a single word since I found her at the mine entrance a while ago.&quot;

&quot;The mine entrance, you say? Hmm...&quot; The doctor thought for a minute. &quot;Fear can instill this, sort of, mind numbing feeling in a person. If anything extremely frightening&#39;s happened to your wife, here, it means she was literally scared stiff.&quot;

&quot;Wh-Well, what can we do about it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to keep her here for a few days. Maybe check up on her, see how her vitals are. If we&#39;re lucky we can get her to talk again.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; He thanked the doctor, and was guided out by his assistant. He went back to his home, nothing else to do. He contemplated the situation. Something at the mine scared his wife, so badly that she couldn&#39;t move, talk, or even think about it. He had to go find whatever it was.
