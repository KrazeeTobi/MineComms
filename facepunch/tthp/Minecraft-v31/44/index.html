I was on a trek back from a distant corner of my map that I generated so I could find some redstone, as my save is a bit outdated. So there I was, carrying 15 or so diamond, a bit of gold, and a [b]lot[/b] of redstone. It&#39;s the middle of the night, but I wasn&#39;t concerned because I play on peaceful most of the time. However, the last update had somehow switched my difficulty to normal. I seriously jumped out of my seat when a spider ambushed me, it got me to half of a heart before I managed to pause and flip the difficulty back. There was no use fighting it, I was totally unarmed and had no armor.

I eventually took a break to see what I&#39;d done, and I was awed by the awesomeness of what I&#39;d done. (granted, it&#39;s extremely pathetic now, but as a new player, it was awesome.)

It said &#39;Facepunch&#39; in cobblestone, and at the far right was a small cave with lava in it. There was an arrow pointing to it, and in there I was going to leave a chest with that diamond pickaxe in it for someone to find.
The way into the cave was a tunnel that was right near the spawn, and there was a very long pit I dug that you had to jump over to get into the main corridor. If you fell, you would die. It was a shame I couldn&#39;t get very far into making the tribute to Fp."

Diamond is most likely to occur in the last few layers of the map. 

As for iron/steel, just keep an eye out when you&#39;re in caves.[/QUOTE]

I think I saw a iron deposit actually, but couldn&#39;t mine it at the time. Lost it now. This goin&#39; take some digging.</span>

The new slimes, while I don&#39;t have screenshot... They look better. They have a slightly transparent outer layer, making them look more like slimes. And you can see a solid core inside it, and it&#39;s little beady eyes.

The new slimes have more of a gel-like look to them I suppose. Not quite as cute as the original skin, but more slime-like.
