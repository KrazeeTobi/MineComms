Hundreds of people buy this game every day and Notch&#39;s sale rate just keeps going up. When the price doubles I can assure you sales won&#39;t slow enough that it&#39;ll have to be on Steam to get people to buy it.

                            <span v-pre>I would be perfectly fine with Notch selling his game through Steam. It would get him more money and attention! I know he won&#39;t sell out to any company, because he knows what is best for the game. Really, I don&#39;t care if newbies flood in after getting it through steam, because all of the them will be banned for not reading the OP. It will be better this way.</span>

There won&#39;t be anything negative about it aside from the influx of new players. The main reason I&#39;d be disappointed about it is because of how many people keep saying that the game will eventually die if it isn&#39;t on Steam. Notch can put Minecraft on Steam if he wants, good for him, but it isn&#39;t necessary if he&#39;s doing it for the sales, because the game is doing fine by the way he sells it. Steam would add to the sales, sure, but it isn&#39;t going to keep them from slowing down eventually."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Doomish;23696510]There won&#39;t be anything negative about it aside from the influx of new players. The main reason I&#39;d be disappointed about it is because of how many people keep saying that the game will eventually die if it isn&#39;t on Steam. Notch can put Minecraft on Steam if he wants, good for him, but it isn&#39;t necessary if he&#39;s doing it for the sales, because the game is doing fine by the way he sells it. Steam would add to the sales, sure, but it isn&#39;t going to keep them from slowing down eventually.[/QUOTE]

So you aren&#39;t disappointed that it might go on Steam, you&#39;re disappointed that people are being dumb about it possibly going on Steam?</span>
