[quote]You ever hear of the game minecraft? You get some dirt, build a little house, punch some assorted farm animals, stuff like that. It’s a pretty nice game. But after what I’ve seen of it, I wish I never even heard about it.

	Most of my steam friends were either offline, away, or too engrossed in their games to chat. I had just gotten minecraft, and due to being quite bored, I decided to try out a MP server. I tapped in “minecraft server no whitelist” in Google, with no luck, but than, I noticed, at the bottom of the page, a single link with the words “superjacks minecraft multiplayer server” 

	In the OP there were only 3 lines of text:

Mods enabled

The server IP

And a website showing the servers status and recent player visits.

I opened up the status site and noticed that there was only 1 player. The list of previous players showed that there had been several players on the server at one point in the past, but the most recent 6 visits was by “megaman22”. Deciding I was bored out of my fucking skull I decided to join the server anyways.

	Typing in the server IP and pressing enter, I appeared in the middle of a small wood village-like town, the entire area seemed shrouded, like a huge airborne structure was hovering over the spawn and was stealing the sun for itself. I wandered around the town, all the doorways and windows were blocked by obsidian and were protected by spawn protection, so I couldn’t break in to see what was inside. at the end of the street stool a huge, gold structure, its doors were unblocked and a sign adorned its front, saying “superjacks casino”. I walked inside to see several makeshift Redstone creations scattered about a cloth floor. Somewhere, a record was playing on a loop. The way to the rooms was also blocked, and key components of most of the machine seemed to have been removed. The only working entrance was the door to the kitchen. 

	The walls were made of gleaming iron, its walls lined with furnaces and chests. It was well lit, with several torches, but there was a huge hole in the wall, seeming to drop into some large cavern. Dropping down into it I noticed I was in a iron-walled subway station. Someone had dug from the casino kitchen to a subway station built near the casino. The tunnel traveling one was had been blocked with unbreakable bricks, so I went down the other, iron lined tunnel. 

	The walls were lined with torches at original intervals at first, but as I continued down the tunnel, the construction of the walls became more and more makeshift, going from Iron to cobble to wool to dirt and sand. The torches became less and less frequent, and the rails that lined the floor began to break up, with a derailed minecart here and there. There were several station platforms, but they were all walled up with brink or obsidian. Each one had a small nameplate before the platform, like “church” or “factory” I finally came to an open platform, a wall blocked the tunnel onwards, and water leaked out of a hole on it. The station sign said “fairgrounds”.

	The fairground was composed of only a large rollercoaster, but most of it had been flooded. I hopped into a cart and the words “have a fun ride! :D” popped into the chat section. A booster shoved me around the track, skipping over a couple broken pieces. As I neared the beginning gate, I saw a person standing on the rails in the entrance gate and heard a faint fizzing noise. as I came closer I noticed his skin. It was the default model but with a large reddish smudge on the jaw/chin area, he didn’t move as I came closer to him, and I noticed he didn’t seem to have a username. the closer I got to him, the loader the sound played, it rose, higher and higher. A second later i was almost upon him, the noise roaring in my headphones. Just before I was about to hit him, I saw his username, superjack. The screen cut to black for several seconds, before it showed the message “you have been banned by superjack”, seconds later, the familiar “java has crashed” popped up on my screen.

I decided to do some research on “superjack”. I managed to find a facebook profile talking about how the user “owned a minecraft server” and that his name was superjack. This message had been posted a couple months back.

He had committed suicide by firearm a week ago.

:phoneline::phoneline::phoneline:

This is a project I came up with while shooting thousands of arrows at sheep.

Desert City is a small city from a game I used to play called Conquer Online.  It&#39;s self descriptive that it&#39;s a city, in the desert.  We&#39;ll either be making this on land on a beach, or in the middle of the ocean due to it being on a peninsula.

Here is the outline of the entire city, ignore the captions and coordinates.

[media]http://img1.91huo.com/conquer91e/2008/06/28/n_dcity5qdK155gLX.jpg[/media]

If the above does not work, try this:

[media]http://www.top1gaming.com/images/conqueronline/n_dcity5qdK155gLX.jpg[/media]

I&#39;m predicting due to the scale of this, we&#39;ll need a team of about 8 people if we want to make this happen as fast as possible, and everyone will assign themselves to a portion of the city to build.

 - The walls, houses, and hanging gardens will all be made out of a mixture of sand, and sandstone as to not keep a repetitive mask.  

 - Roads will either be made out of Obsidian, Complete Half Blocks, Stone, or Cobble.

 - The Grass on the first portion of the city, where you may see the caption of Boxer Zhang and Blacksmith, will be grass of course.

 - The vegetation on Hanging Gardens will be a mixture of leaves, flowers, saplings, and trees.

 - Wall floors will be made out of Cobble, Stone, Half Blocks, I&#39;ll leave that up to whoever is making it up.

 - Fences on houses, and the ground will be made out of fences, obviously.

 - Water is water, sand is sand, trees are trees, flowers are flowers and all that jazz.  Just don&#39;t be placing gold and diamond blocks where sand should be.  Use the map for reference or ask me.
