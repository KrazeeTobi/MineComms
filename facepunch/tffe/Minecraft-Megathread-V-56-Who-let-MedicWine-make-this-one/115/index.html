This is a project I came up with while shooting thousands of arrows at sheep.

Desert City is a small city from a game I used to play called Conquer Online.  It&#39;s self descriptive that it&#39;s a city, in the desert.  We&#39;ll either be making this on land on a beach, or in the middle of the ocean due to it being on a peninsula.

Here is the outline of the entire city, ignore the captions and coordinates.

[media]http://img1.91huo.com/conquer91e/2008/06/28/n_dcity5qdK155gLX.jpg[/media]

If the above does not work, try this:

[media]http://www.top1gaming.com/images/conqueronline/n_dcity5qdK155gLX.jpg[/media]

I&#39;m predicting due to the scale of this, we&#39;ll need a team of about 8 people if we want to make this happen as fast as possible, and everyone will assign themselves to a portion of the city to build.

 - The walls, houses, and hanging gardens will all be made out of a mixture of sand, and sandstone as to not keep a repetitive mask.  

 - Roads will either be made out of Obsidian, Complete Half Blocks, Stone, or Cobble.

 - The Grass on the first portion of the city, where you may see the caption of Boxer Zhang and Blacksmith, will be grass of course.

 - The vegetation on Hanging Gardens will be a mixture of leaves, flowers, saplings, and trees.

 - Wall floors will be made out of Cobble, Stone, Half Blocks, I&#39;ll leave that up to whoever is making it up.

 - Fences on houses, and the ground will be made out of fences, obviously.

 - Water is water, sand is sand, trees are trees, flowers are flowers and all that jazz.  Just don&#39;t be placing gold and diamond blocks where sand should be.  Use the map for reference or ask me.

:phoneline::phoneline::phoneline:

This is a project I came up with while shooting thousands of arrows at sheep.

Desert City is a small city from a game I used to play called Conquer Online.  It&#39;s self descriptive that it&#39;s a city, in the desert.  We&#39;ll either be making this on land on a beach, or in the middle of the ocean due to it being on a peninsula.

Here is the outline of the entire city, ignore the captions and coordinates.

[media]http://img1.91huo.com/conquer91e/2008/06/28/n_dcity5qdK155gLX.jpg[/media]

If the above does not work, try this:

[media]http://www.top1gaming.com/images/conqueronline/n_dcity5qdK155gLX.jpg[/media]

I&#39;m predicting due to the scale of this, we&#39;ll need a team of about 8 people if we want to make this happen as fast as possible, and everyone will assign themselves to a portion of the city to build.

 - The walls, houses, and hanging gardens will all be made out of a mixture of sand, and sandstone as to not keep a repetitive mask.  

 - Roads will either be made out of Obsidian, Complete Half Blocks, Stone, or Cobble.

 - The Grass on the first portion of the city, where you may see the caption of Boxer Zhang and Blacksmith, will be grass of course.

 - The vegetation on Hanging Gardens will be a mixture of leaves, flowers, saplings, and trees.

 - Wall floors will be made out of Cobble, Stone, Half Blocks, I&#39;ll leave that up to whoever is making it up.

 - Fences on houses, and the ground will be made out of fences, obviously.

 - Water is water, sand is sand, trees are trees, flowers are flowers and all that jazz.  Just don&#39;t be placing gold and diamond blocks where sand should be.  Use the map for reference or ask me.

Means the server was unable to authenticate the client with minecraft.net because minecraft.net returned a 503 error ( Service unavailable ), so the server kicked the player.</span>

This is a project I came up with while shooting thousands of arrows at sheep.

Desert City is a small city from a game I used to play called Conquer Online.  It&#39;s self descriptive that it&#39;s a city, in the desert.  We&#39;ll either be making this on land on a beach, or in the middle of the ocean due to it being on a peninsula.

Here is the outline of the entire city, ignore the captions and coordinates.
