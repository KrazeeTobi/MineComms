If you&#39;re new to Minecraft or somehow managed to run into this thread, here&#39;s a little explanation of it:
[release]Minecraft first turned out to be a singleplayer/online game where you built anything your heart desired with a large variety of blocks. This gamemode was and still is called Creative. But since Survival Mode is all the rage, Creative seems to be lost behind all of the commotion, only played by the poor men of the Internet.

What exactly is Survival Mode?
Survival Mode was the second gamemode Notch (aka Markus Persson, the creator of Minecraft) has ever made to Minecraft. The gamemode is all what you can imagine by the title - surviving. With the ability to create any structure with a large variety of interesting craftable and obtainable items, endless hours of gameplay. And with the exciting Multiplayer, it just keeps getting better.

Survival Mode all started out with Survival Test, with Notch just toying with things that would soon become the incredible gamemode we all play today.

Next came /indev/, also known as In Development(?), which was just Survival Test, only, well, I&#39;m not exactly sure why he did this, but he did it for a very good reason I bet.

After that came /infdev/, also known as Infinite Development(?), but again, like /indev/. I&#39;m still boggled about why he did this.

And finally, after everything was prepared, he released the fantastic game of Minecraft Alpha (also known as Minecraft Survival), the game we HAD until December 20, when the game was updated to Beta and the price was doubled! Further updates will continue to be free but this means the game will be nearing completion far in the future![/release][release]What are mobs?
Mobs are creatures that roam the generated terrain of every level. They can range from nice pigs to green dicks that blow up your shit.

There are currently 12 mobs in Survival Mode, with 5 of them being passive.

Pigs
- Pigs are friendly mobs. They may seem cute, but not everyone lives forever. So you&#39;ll have to kill such adorable creatures for their delicious bacon that heals 1.5 hearts (cooked bacon heals 4 hearts).

Sheep
- Sheep are just as adorable as pigs. You are able magically shear them with your hands by punching them, which results in 1-3 blocks of wool being dropped.

Cows
- Cows seem friendly, but they look pretty stupid. But these mobs drop up to 1-3 leather, which can collected to be crafted into really crappy armor.

Chickens
- Chickens may look like ducks, but try not to get them confused too much. Chickens can drop from 1-3 feathers when killed.

[highlight]NEW:[/highlight] Squids
- Squids are a new addition to Minecraft that came with a big update. When killed, they drop 1 - 3 ink sacks which is useful for wool dye.

Zombies
- Zombies looks like they&#39;re ready to hug, right? Well try not to get too close, because these fuckers pack a punch. They drop 1-3 feathers for God knows why when killed. When it turns day, they begin to burn (there must be no blocks above them, even leaves).

Skeletons
- These assholes like to shoot arrows at you from anywhere when they&#39;re close to you. Do NOT get trapped in a pit with Skeletons above you. When killed, they drop 1-3 arrows. Just like Zombies, they burn as well when it&#39;s day.

Spiders
- Spiders lurk anywhere, and are ready to jump at you whenever. They can be a big pain in the ass, especially when there are more than one. When killed, they drop 1-3 string. But with Spiders, they do not start on fire, but most of the time they become friendly, making nice house guests.

Slimes
- Slimes are currently broken for some odd reason. But they are very adorable mobs, even if they are unfriendly. Slimes can range from many sizes; smallest slimes don&#39;t hurt you, so you can have them follow you and keep them as a pet! When they are killed, they usually drop 1-3(?) slime balls.

Creeperssssssssssss
- These gigantic faggot dicks are the epiphany of why I hate this game at times. They can be lurking ANYWHERE - even more concealed than spiders, and jump at you and blow up for no reason. They may seem like they need a hug (like Zombies) but be careful - they will destroy your shit. And what makes it worse is that they do NOT burn in daylight. But they drop 1-3 gunpowder when they are killed (not blown up) that can be crafted with sand to create TNT.

Pig Zombies
- Pig Zombies were added in during the Halloween Update. Though they can only be found in the Nether, they are completely friendly (until you disturb them by hurting them).

Ghasts
- Ghasts were added in during the Halloween Update. These large, white, box-like, annoying fuckers shoot fireballs at you from wherever they are floating, even if you aren&#39;t that close. Thank god Notch fixed them from crying so much when on fire, you&#39;d probably quit playing the game when it happened.[/release][release]What is the Nether?
The Nether (underworld, hell, etc.) was added in during the Halloween Update. When you construct a portal (an outline of a box used with obsidian and then lit with flint and steel) it will teleport you to a randomly generated level called the Nether. There are all sorts of interesting things there. But don&#39;t let me bore you with words, go try it for yourself![/release][highlight]If you have anymore questions about Minecraft, please look at the wikipedia first:[/highlight]

[release][highlight]THINGS WE ALL KNOW
1. FLOATING ISLANDS EXIST
2. There is a &quot;Woo, Facepunch!&quot; Splash image.
3. There are dungeons on the surface.
4. Some users [del]Mario583[/del] can be annoying. There is an ignore list.
5. There is drama in this thread. Try not get involved. Bitching about drama is getting involved. Just ignore it :munch:, or find some content to post.

[u][b]Welcome to Mr_FJ&#39;s Minecraft Universe[/b][/u] - So far I only have one server, but I hope to expand, as the community grows.

One of the things, I hope will be a big selling point, for my server(s); Is that they will be up 24/7, because they are hosted game servers (sleekservers.com), with full support and no-lag guarantee for up to 28 players.
There is no whitelist (It will have anti griefing measures), but please visit the website before entering the server: [url]mrfj.webs.com[/url]

Projects!

Bropacolypse:
Magicman1234 is working on a project called Bropacolypse. It&#39;s not a server, but he soon hopes it will be. Basically he&#39;s editing in as many community made objects as possible, and making them look torn down. PM him if you want your stuff to be in it.

Hezzy&#39;s NationCraft:
 A server with a custom built map split into three distinct factions with their own building styles. Players will join together to compete against rival nations in admin-led RP events! Coming to a server near you soon!

Vexx21322 is making a secret project here and there. This sounds menacing. Prepare your bodies. 

Tyvak and his brother have started doing walkthroughs of their coop server. They&#39;re pretty funny.

If you&#39;re new to Minecraft or somehow managed to run into this thread, here&#39;s a little explanation of it:
[release]Minecraft first turned out to be a singleplayer/online game where you built anything your heart desired with a large variety of blocks. This gamemode was and still is called Creative. But since Survival Mode is all the rage, Creative seems to be lost behind all of the commotion, only played by the poor men of the Internet.

What exactly is Survival Mode?
Survival Mode was the second gamemode Notch (aka Markus Persson, the creator of Minecraft) has ever made to Minecraft. The gamemode is all what you can imagine by the title - surviving. With the ability to create any structure with a large variety of interesting craftable and obtainable items, endless hours of gameplay. And with the exciting Multiplayer, it just keeps getting better.

Survival Mode all started out with Survival Test, with Notch just toying with things that would soon become the incredible gamemode we all play today.

Next came /indev/, also known as In Development(?), which was just Survival Test, only, well, I&#39;m not exactly sure why he did this, but he did it for a very good reason I bet.

After that came /infdev/, also known as Infinite Development(?), but again, like /indev/. I&#39;m still boggled about why he did this.

And finally, after everything was prepared, he released the fantastic game of Minecraft Alpha (also known as Minecraft Survival), the game we HAD until December 20, when the game was updated to Beta and the price was doubled! Further updates will continue to be free but this means the game will be nearing completion far in the future![/release][release]What are mobs?
Mobs are creatures that roam the generated terrain of every level. They can range from nice pigs to green dicks that blow up your shit.

There are currently 12 mobs in Survival Mode, with 5 of them being passive.

Pigs
- Pigs are friendly mobs. They may seem cute, but not everyone lives forever. So you&#39;ll have to kill such adorable creatures for their delicious bacon that heals 1.5 hearts (cooked bacon heals 4 hearts).

Sheep
- Sheep are just as adorable as pigs. You are able magically shear them with your hands by punching them, which results in 1-3 blocks of wool being dropped.

Cows
- Cows seem friendly, but they look pretty stupid. But these mobs drop up to 1-3 leather, which can collected to be crafted into really crappy armor.

Chickens
- Chickens may look like ducks, but try not to get them confused too much. Chickens can drop from 1-3 feathers when killed.

[highlight]NEW:[/highlight] Squids
- Squids are a new addition to Minecraft that came with a big update. When killed, they drop 1 - 3 ink sacks which is useful for wool dye.

Zombies
- Zombies looks like they&#39;re ready to hug, right? Well try not to get too close, because these fuckers pack a punch. They drop 1-3 feathers for God knows why when killed. When it turns day, they begin to burn (there must be no blocks above them, even leaves).

Skeletons
- These assholes like to shoot arrows at you from anywhere when they&#39;re close to you. Do NOT get trapped in a pit with Skeletons above you. When killed, they drop 1-3 arrows. Just like Zombies, they burn as well when it&#39;s day.

Spiders
- Spiders lurk anywhere, and are ready to jump at you whenever. They can be a big pain in the ass, especially when there are more than one. When killed, they drop 1-3 string. But with Spiders, they do not start on fire, but most of the time they become friendly, making nice house guests.

Slimes
- Slimes are currently broken for some odd reason. But they are very adorable mobs, even if they are unfriendly. Slimes can range from many sizes; smallest slimes don&#39;t hurt you, so you can have them follow you and keep them as a pet! When they are killed, they usually drop 1-3(?) slime balls.

Creeperssssssssssss
- These gigantic faggot dicks are the epiphany of why I hate this game at times. They can be lurking ANYWHERE - even more concealed than spiders, and jump at you and blow up for no reason. They may seem like they need a hug (like Zombies) but be careful - they will destroy your shit. And what makes it worse is that they do NOT burn in daylight. But they drop 1-3 gunpowder when they are killed (not blown up) that can be crafted with sand to create TNT.

Pig Zombies
- Pig Zombies were added in during the Halloween Update. Though they can only be found in the Nether, they are completely friendly (until you disturb them by hurting them).

Ghasts
- Ghasts were added in during the Halloween Update. These large, white, box-like, annoying fuckers shoot fireballs at you from wherever they are floating, even if you aren&#39;t that close. Thank god Notch fixed them from crying so much when on fire, you&#39;d probably quit playing the game when it happened.[/release][release]What is the Nether?
The Nether (underworld, hell, etc.) was added in during the Halloween Update. When you construct a portal (an outline of a box used with obsidian and then lit with flint and steel) it will teleport you to a randomly generated level called the Nether. There are all sorts of interesting things there. But don&#39;t let me bore you with words, go try it for yourself![/release][highlight]If you have anymore questions about Minecraft, please look at the wikipedia first:[/highlight]

[release][highlight]THINGS WE ALL KNOW
1. FLOATING ISLANDS EXIST
2. There is a &quot;Woo, Facepunch!&quot; Splash image.
3. There are dungeons on the surface.
4. Some users [del]Mario583[/del] can be annoying. There is an ignore list.
5. There is drama in this thread. Try not get involved. Bitching about drama is getting involved. Just ignore it :munch:, or find some content to post.

[u][b]Welcome to Mr_FJ&#39;s Minecraft Universe[/b][/u] - So far I only have one server, but I hope to expand, as the community grows.

One of the things, I hope will be a big selling point, for my server(s); Is that they will be up 24/7, because they are hosted game servers (sleekservers.com), with full support and no-lag guarantee for up to 28 players.
There is no whitelist (It will have anti griefing measures), but please visit the website before entering the server: [url]mrfj.webs.com[/url]

Projects!

Bropacolypse:
Magicman1234 is working on a project called Bropacolypse. It&#39;s not a server, but he soon hopes it will be. Basically he&#39;s editing in as many community made objects as possible, and making them look torn down. PM him if you want your stuff to be in it.

Hezzy&#39;s NationCraft:
 A server with a custom built map split into three distinct factions with their own building styles. Players will join together to compete against rival nations in admin-led RP events! Coming to a server near you soon!

Vexx21322 is making a secret project here and there. This sounds menacing. Prepare your bodies. 

Tyvak and his brother have started doing walkthroughs of their coop server. They&#39;re pretty funny.
