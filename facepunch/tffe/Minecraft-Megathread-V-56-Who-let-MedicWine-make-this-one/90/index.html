PART 2: The End

[quote]Hollowing a mountain for our home didn&#39;t take long. Coating the inside in a protective layer of stolen obsidian didn&#39;t take long either. What took longest was the thefts themselves. After we had gotten revenge on the griefer, we had been pulling off 2-3 heists per day. Usually, we checked that the owners were offline, meaning it could be a few days until someone even knew they had been stolen from. 

The bottom floor of our mountain-house was the party floor. One half of it was for dancing, with an underground redstone circuit that cause torches to flicker on and off. Then there was the bar, and the swimming pool. The second floor was our treasure trove. Three different room, consistent with the three cities, held our spoils when we weren&#39;t using them. The top floor was our quarters. Grimm continued the outer wall&#39;s dark, obsidian theme. Onyx took it upon himself to make a golden palace. I kept it conservative, and made a glass room surrounded by waterfalls that led to the pool. From the outside, our home appeared as if it was an untouched mountain. 

The next house we were to hit was the largest: a castle in the sky that you could reach only through a water elevator. We each made a boat, and headed to the small lake formed by the waterfall. Grimm went up first, next Onyx, I went last. When I got all the way up, Grimm had already swept the house and found the chests, Onyx  was already keeping guard. Grimm took me to the chests, and I quickly filled my inventory with the rare materials. 

That was when Onyx sent me a /tell saying that a player in a boat was headed up the waterfall. We panicked, and tried to find hiding spots. When the owner reached the castle, he stayed near the waterfall, the only exit. We were trapped. 

Onyx told me he had a plan, and stepped out into the open. The owner saw him, and began to chase him through the castle. Grimm and I ran for the exit, jumped to the lake, and made our way back to the mountain. The owner of the castle sent a message to all players, “Looks like I found the thief.” 

Little did we know, this player was an OP. He didn&#39;t waste time in dealing out Onyx&#39; ban. Believing he had stopped the thief scum, he promptly logged off.

It was just Grimm and I, hiding out in our fortress. Everyone knew that Onyx was a part of our trio, now they&#39;d know that we were thieves too. And I was pretty sure that someone knew that we lived in a mountain. We didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go, though, so we just hid in our quarters. 

At one point, I went down to get something from a chest. I got it, and in the corner, on the stairs leading to the bottom floor, I saw TNT. I ran back up to the top of the mountain, and began destroying an obsidian tunnel to freedom. We escaped, hid out in a forest, and watched as they destroyed the inside of our base, and continued to dismantle our obsidian wall. Once again, we were without a home. This time, though, the entire server was looking for us. 

Grimm and I cut down a few trees, and crafted several boats and swords. We made a run for the beach, past the players still on the server, threw our boats into the water, and began sailing. After about ten minutes of maneuvering through islands and archipelagos, we found a suitable island, and began a new life. 

Twenty minutes later, after we had established a nice little house, several players (the admin&#39;s personal guard) sailed up to our home and began to destroy everything we had, as revenge. The admin teleported us to the center of City 2, where the rest of the players stood watching as he forced us to throw all of our items into a fire, jump in after them, and promptly banned us. 

The brotherhood was dead.[/quote]

And that was the end of that server."

The top floor was our quarters. Grimm continued the outer wall&#39;s dark, obsidian theme. Onyx took it upon himself to make a golden palace. I kept it conservative, and made a glass room surrounded by waterfalls that led to the pool. From the outside, our home appeared as if it was an untouched mountain. 

The next house we were to hit was the largest: a castle in the sky that you could reach only through a water elevator. We each made a boat, and headed to the small lake formed by the waterfall. Grimm went up first, next Onyx, I went last. When I got all the way up, Grimm had already swept the house and found the chests, Onyx  was already keeping guard. Grimm took me to the chests, and I quickly filled my inventory with the rare materials. 

That was when Onyx sent me a /tell saying that a player in a boat was headed up the waterfall. We panicked, and tried to find hiding spots. When the owner reached the castle, he stayed near the waterfall, the only exit. We were trapped. 

Onyx told me he had a plan, and stepped out into the open. The owner saw him, and began to chase him through the castle. Grimm and I ran for the exit, jumped to the lake, and made our way back to the mountain. The owner of the castle sent a message to all players, “Looks like I found the thief.” 

Little did we know, this player was an OP. He didn&#39;t waste time in dealing out Onyx&#39; ban. Believing he had stopped the thief scum, he promptly logged off.

It was just Grimm and I, hiding out in our fortress. Everyone knew that Onyx was a part of our trio, now they&#39;d know that we were thieves too. And I was pretty sure that someone knew that we lived in a mountain. We didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go, though, so we just hid in our quarters. 

At one point, I went down to get something from a chest. I got it, and in the corner, on the stairs leading to the bottom floor, I saw TNT. I ran back up to the top of the mountain, and began destroying an obsidian tunnel to freedom. We escaped, hid out in a forest, and watched as they destroyed the inside of our base, and continued to dismantle our obsidian wall. Once again, we were without a home. This time, though, the entire server was looking for us. 

Grimm and I cut down a few trees, and crafted several boats and swords. We made a run for the beach, past the players still on the server, threw our boats into the water, and began sailing. After about ten minutes of maneuvering through islands and archipelagos, we found a suitable island, and began a new life. 

Twenty minutes later, after we had established a nice little house, several players (the admin&#39;s personal guard) sailed up to our home and began to destroy everything we had, as revenge. The admin teleported us to the center of City 2, where the rest of the players stood watching as he forced us to throw all of our items into a fire, jump in after them, and promptly banned us. 

The brotherhood was dead.[/quote]

And that was the end of that server.</span>

If you&#39;re using 3DS Max: 
1. On the &quot;Create &gt; Geometry&quot; tab, create a plane. Change it&#39;s colour to a slightly off-white.
2. Add an &quot;edit poly&quot; modifier and extrude the side and back edges upwards to form a sort of &quot;stage&quot;.
3.Select all the faces and use &quot;Tessellate&quot; in the Edit Poly modifier to cut it up a bit.
4. Add a &quot;Turbosmooth&quot; modifier to curve it nicely around the bottoms.
5. Go to &quot;Rendering &gt; Light Tracer&quot; and make sure the dropdown is on &quot;Light Tracer&quot;. 
6. Change &quot;Bounces&quot; to 1.

Also make sure your light has it&#39;s Shadows &quot;On&quot; box ticked (and that you have a light in the first place).

If you&#39;re using blender: 
Feck knows, I&#39;m too lazy to try and understand it&#39;s weird-ass controls and interface.

Oh, and I&#39;ve done pretty much all the blocks anybody would want:
