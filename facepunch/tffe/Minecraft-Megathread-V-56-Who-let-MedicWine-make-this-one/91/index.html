                        <postrender input="This is a story of one of the greatest Minecraft experiences I have ever had for the sheer fun it was that took place on Profans server and I would like to share a ummmm embellished view of this quest to escape the Nether!
And no I will not do a Tl:dr.
And sorry is the English is bad, I wrote it in a rush.



The epic of Obsidian and Kona!
Trapped with in the Nether two miners had been teleported into the Nether soon after the Great nether fail of 2011 by a unknown force, trapped with out any tools to our names and nothing more then a few blocks of Slowsand and only a vague outline of the position of fellow miners and the new base camp we set out on a epic quest to escape!

The quest started on a fairly down tone note with very few incidents of Ghasts or annoying walls in our way... This all changed quickly after the cliff of ages was found, a sheer cliff of Neatherrack and a number of Ghasts bearing down upon us we where forced to run and hide in till they believed it was safe, the floor was being blown apart slowly by the Ghasts throwing the balls of hellfire upon us but I idea came upon us. We shouted &quot;We shall make out own path, in this land of fire and lava. The Ghasts shall not defeat us&quot;. Upon the sound of this war cry we did it, the cliff of ages was no longer a problem, a small leap for two miner so great of spirit!

The small amount of blocks of Slowsand became the things of Gods in our hands and with much jumping and leaping upon the Slowsand we ascended like a graceful hummingbird lifting it self above challenges that would have crushed smaller souls. At this time we had reached the original base camp of the Nether based in the temple of Whitecliff, the destruction that had killed so many in the great Nether fail of 2011was clearly visible for us to see we it shook us and Obsidian said upon to Kona &quot;What sort of monster could have done such evil, the Nether explores did not mean harm, all we wished to do was explore and visit new lands. The taint of the Ghasts must be destroyed where ever it rears its head, it must be rooted out and crushed to avoid the deaths of more good Miners. The evil Ghasts must die!&quot;

By some evil magic this speech drove the Ghast taint towards us, we where not armed with the holy weapons of Bow and Arrow so there was little we could do but still we fought, with out bare hands we launched into fists and kicks upon the unholy Ghast swarm, the floor was being destroyed before us but still we carried on in till the end. It&#39;s a feat never heard of in the whole of the greater profan region to kill a Ghast with Diamond swords and armour with out the aid of a bow and arrow, but this was in a class of it&#39;s own for Kona and Obsidian together with the fury of the Gods above took down the mighty Ghast, it&#39;s body fell upon the floor with a crash that destroyed even more the floor around the Heroes. T&#39;was a sight to see!

With the battle over and done the mighty Heroes made the way around the ruins of nether base one, holes from previous battles with the unholy Ghasts had left scars around the base and with out the tools or block to repair the damage we left them with a tear in our eyes at the destruction we could not have prevented at the unholy beasts hands. Later the two found their way to the stair case that lead into the Heavens of hope for the two had seen the name tags of many a good Miner such as Profanwolf and Swebonny and this gave then a whole new urge to force away across this land of fire. The stair case did not deliver the hope that they had needed, unseen by the great miners only around a hundred blocks away they crossed over many a cave in the hope of finding a way to reach the miners but this was not to be! It took many a hour serching the caves of the Nether with the screams of the unholy Ghasts and the deformed Pigmen of which so far had not caused trouble for the two heroes and in the end they fell upon a cave of a much large scale them the one they had found so far. In this cave there was a pit that lead down to the plains of Nethererack that boarded the great Lava seas that coved much of the land of fire. The two heroes fell upon this and despaired, there was no way to escape this hell and they heroes fell upon the ground near one of the fires that dotted this land. They despaired for the family that they had left behind, and the friend that would never see them again, they knew that soon the fires that ravaged this land would soon consume them and they would die and their body will never been found. Hunger slowly consumed them. Delusions became normal and the trees of Mainland appeared , the temple in the city of New Egypt became clear to them and the toilet of Purp looked to consume the pit in the centre of the cave. It was not in till Kona looked upon one of the walls of the cave and saw it, for the first time he saw the hole that looked to contain torches upon the walls. The torches could only mean one thing that that was people, and people meant safety!

Lifting their empty bodys the scaled the hard terrane that layed before the hole they had seen in till they came upon the wall that the hole was upon. Upon getting there they found that the hole had again been a delusion and it became clear they had no hope in till Obsidian claimed &amp;#8220; If the hole does not already exist we will be forced to make it our self, we shall not let this land of fire stop us!&amp;#8221; . Without tools this was a fools task but it was undertaken without regard for this small mater and they dug! Ohhh how they dug, it was magnificent! The hard Netherrack cracked the already cracked skin on their fists and the blood pored freely staining the red rock with blood! And they carried on in till a small light popped into existence in the walls on the stairs they had been digging, it was the tunnel and this tunnel gave path for safely and life. Soon after the miner Swebonney heard the cries of the two upon the walls of one of the lower tunnels and dug with his pick, the Netherrack falling before him in great amounts be dug the two out of the tunnel and gave them stairs into the area in which the portal to the Mainland lay. They where saved and two miners left the nether. Alive!"

                            <span v-pre>This is a story of one of the greatest Minecraft experiences I have ever had for the sheer fun it was that took place on Profans server and I would like to share a ummmm embellished view of this quest to escape the Nether!
And no I will not do a Tl:dr.
And sorry is the English is bad, I wrote it in a rush.



The epic of Obsidian and Kona!
Trapped with in the Nether two miners had been teleported into the Nether soon after the Great nether fail of 2011 by a unknown force, trapped with out any tools to our names and nothing more then a few blocks of Slowsand and only a vague outline of the position of fellow miners and the new base camp we set out on a epic quest to escape!

The quest started on a fairly down tone note with very few incidents of Ghasts or annoying walls in our way... This all changed quickly after the cliff of ages was found, a sheer cliff of Neatherrack and a number of Ghasts bearing down upon us we where forced to run and hide in till they believed it was safe, the floor was being blown apart slowly by the Ghasts throwing the balls of hellfire upon us but I idea came upon us. We shouted &quot;We shall make out own path, in this land of fire and lava. The Ghasts shall not defeat us&quot;. Upon the sound of this war cry we did it, the cliff of ages was no longer a problem, a small leap for two miner so great of spirit!

The small amount of blocks of Slowsand became the things of Gods in our hands and with much jumping and leaping upon the Slowsand we ascended like a graceful hummingbird lifting it self above challenges that would have crushed smaller souls. At this time we had reached the original base camp of the Nether based in the temple of Whitecliff, the destruction that had killed so many in the great Nether fail of 2011was clearly visible for us to see we it shook us and Obsidian said upon to Kona &quot;What sort of monster could have done such evil, the Nether explores did not mean harm, all we wished to do was explore and visit new lands. The taint of the Ghasts must be destroyed where ever it rears its head, it must be rooted out and crushed to avoid the deaths of more good Miners. The evil Ghasts must die!&quot;

By some evil magic this speech drove the Ghast taint towards us, we where not armed with the holy weapons of Bow and Arrow so there was little we could do but still we fought, with out bare hands we launched into fists and kicks upon the unholy Ghast swarm, the floor was being destroyed before us but still we carried on in till the end.
