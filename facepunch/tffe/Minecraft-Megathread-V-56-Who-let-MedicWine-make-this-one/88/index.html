[quote]It was on a server two months ago that our journey begins. I was fresh to the SMP scene, as were most Minecrafters. I was playing for fun, just trying to enjoy the game. I had been searching for a good server for several days, and finally, I had found one. There was a good amount of people on there, around 12, and I was thrust into the world with no supplies, no warning, in the middle of night, with mobs on the highest difficulty. I cried for help as I was being chased by a creeper, and to my pleasure, a bloke opened his castle doors to me. 

I found that the castle was owned by two players, named GrimmReaper and Onyxhead (both of them had some numbers that I can&#39;t remember, because they&#39;re numbers). They let me spend the night, and in the morning Grimm sent me off with some food, wood, and some iron, though they each still had to use stone tools. But, instead of building my house, I wasted the day by exploring the map in awe. Night hit, and I had to dig a small hole to save myself from the dreaded creatures. 

Day hit, and I began to feel bad that I had taken supplies from these two players and not offered anything in return. I decided to do something about that. I found a house owned by a very well-off player (it had walls of iron and floors of gold), and I broke in through the back with my iron pickaxe. I replaced the walls and began searching for his treasure chests. 

Halfway through my raid, however, the owner came home. He had all-diamond armour and a diamond sword, as if he knew I was there. I held down shift like it was the only thing I could do, and crouched behind a corner, sure that I was dead. He began to look through his chests, apparently searching for a certain item, when he said, &amp;#8220;Hey! Who&#39;s been in my chests?!&amp;#8221;

Suddenly someone else came into the room. It was Onyx. He said, &amp;#8220;Someone was in your chests? Someone was in mine, too!&amp;#8221; The owner of the home proposed a hunt outside, and Onyx obliged. Before he left, he turned and looked at me. I broke through the wall and escaped. That night, he invited me to his castle and explained (through a conversation of /tell messages) that he had seen me break into this guy&#39;s house, and saw the owner coming home, and had to protect me. 

He also said that he, too, was a thief. 

That was the beginning of this brotherhood. Onyx, Grimm and I had become a team. The next day, we did our first three person heist. Onyx was Guard to make sure no one came, while Grimm was Sweeper to find the chests and tell me, the Looter, where they were. Soon we had gathered all the supplies we wanted, and we three left the house in the same condition, to head back to our castle. When we got there, what we saw was horrendous. 

The walls had been destroyed. There were TNT scars across the ground. The wooden second floor was on fire, almost all of it burnt already. Our chests had been stolen from&amp;#8212;they left nothing. We were poor, except from the few spoils we had. 

We deposited what items we had left in a chest buried on the nearby beach, and we spread out to try to discover who it was. One of the major items we had lost was nether stone, given to us by the admin for use in our fireplace. The server didn&#39;t have any other nether stone than those three pieces, so we knew what we were looking for. We began systematically checking houses, but with 30 players who frequented the server and three different cities, it would be a big task to find the bandit. But we were up to the challenge. 

Four days after the attack on our house, we discovered the culprit. It was a player with at least 5 X&#39;s in his name, several numbers and aLtErNaTiNg CaSeS. We wouldn&#39;t regret this. We discovered him when he went to fill in a wall in his home, and chose the wrong item&amp;#8212;our nether rock. We waited until nightfall, when he conveniently put his items in a chest and went off mining, and we made our move. 

We entered through the front door. I continued to be the Looter, going through all of his chests and taking the valuables, throwing the common items into the fireplace made by two of our nether rock pieces. I got everything, when I found his TNT stash. I was guessing that he&#39;d hacked these in, because it&#39;s very hard to get 5 64 stacks of TNT on hard difficulty, legitimately. I told Grimm of this, and after Onyx had dismantled all of his decorations, the two of them proceded to place TNT all through his house, sparing not a single floor a single block of air. We made a trail going out the door, activated it, and ran. 

The explosion almost crashed the server. Several people lost connections to the game. The lag lasted at least 5 minutes. We hurried back to our house&#39;s ruins, gathered the things from our beach chest, and left to go make a new home. [/quote]

TO BE RESOLVED TOMORROW MORNING.

Unless no one likes the stories of my exploits, then I&#39;ll just leave it at that. It&#39;s like a happy ending, before the bad ending.

I know it&#39;s in progress and I don&#39;t know what look you&#39;re going for, but try making details and parts of the hull with something other than wood planks.  Mix it up.  Just because the back uses one material doesn&#39;t mean the front has to use the same one.  Find some inspiration."
