                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Beetle179;22669784]I&#39;m starting to get a little annoyed with Minecraft. The caves (although regional) are far, far too big and too numerous (even in regions with not much). Lighting them up so mobs will not spawn in them is ~impossible, seeing as you&#39;ll need a LOT of torches and probably die from a mob anyway. Sure, you can play on Peaceful, but then it just isn&#39;t fun.

Also, the whole wipe-your-inventory thing if you run the isometric map viewer.

ALSO, the &quot;oh and im also taking away all of ur hard work k&quot; thing.

I&#39;m getting frustrated. I could live with a lost inventory and maybe even start a new map, but the caves are driving me absolutely insane.
