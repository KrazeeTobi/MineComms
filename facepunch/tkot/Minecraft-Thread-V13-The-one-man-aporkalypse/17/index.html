I did, i put my signature on all of them, and if you want confirmation, go to the server(MC maniacs) and ask the owner Malcon2 if i really made them. To claim i&#39;m not tickle would be silly, look at my name:

&lt;~~~~~~~~~~~~

But yes, i do have too much time on my hands, it isn&#39;t easy to get a job right now and I&#39;ve been out of school for several weeks now, not too much to do besides occasionally hanging out with college friends who live hours away :\. Also forgot i posted them a couple threads back, i posted them not to see if i could get any of them featured in the OP because my friend floreum recommended i do it after one of his was.

Yeah he plays with us occasionally, he makes some kick ass pixel art man. Everything above the mario sprite tower is stuff we built a while ago before we took a break."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Beetle179;22594896]That was in a thread a couple threads back. I also doubt you made all of those, if any. Either that, or you have far, far, FAR too much time on your hands.[/QUOTE]

I did, i put my signature on all of them, and if you want confirmation, go to the server(MC maniacs) and ask the owner Malcon2 if i really made them. To claim i&#39;m not tickle would be silly, look at my name:

&lt;~~~~~~~~~~~~

But yes, i do have too much time on my hands, it isn&#39;t easy to get a job right now and I&#39;ve been out of school for several weeks now, not too much to do besides occasionally hanging out with college friends who live hours away :\. Also forgot i posted them a couple threads back, i posted them not to see if i could get any of them featured in the OP because my friend floreum recommended i do it after one of his was.


[QUOTE=Rubs10;22594933]omg, HQRSE plays this?

Just talked to him, apparently he made that before xmas.[/QUOTE]

Yeah he plays with us occasionally, he makes some kick ass pixel art man. Everything above the mario sprite tower is stuff we built a while ago before we took a break.</span>

Infdev multiplayer is the big and hardest project I think for minecraft. Once it&#39;s done, notch only needs to make small changes to adapt it into all of the other gamemodes planned. Infdev is the base. I assume that creative would be a mode re-created later, with more features than the free creative now has. I would hope that notch made it a simple system where he can just have it so that if you click X gamemode, it loads X features from the base."
