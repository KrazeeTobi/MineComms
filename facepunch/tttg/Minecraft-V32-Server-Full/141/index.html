Let me bold some things for you.

[QUOTE=justin1992;23817158]Hey guys. Here is a simple thought.

If you don&#39;t like the game, or don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the amount of money it&#39;s being sold for, DON&#39;T FUCKING BUY IT. [B]We don&#39;t need any of your shit[/B], if you don&#39;t like it that&#39;s fine, [B]we don&#39;t give a damn[/B]. But please don&#39;t come in here and whine that [B]it&#39;s too expensive for your mommy to buy it for you, and therefore you think it&#39;s shit[/B]. [B]Just get out and don&#39;t bother us, go play something you think is worth the money, like WoW or MW2 or some stupid game[/B].[/QUOTE]

All the bolded parts are accusations or ad hominem. Both of which have no part in a civilized discussion.

To me, a game worth a fair bit of money is a game with either a strong plot and character development, which help you believe the story which gets you more and more involved, or a game with strong gameplay and a great online community. A sandbox game, at least in my eyes does not foot the bill. I&#39;m willing to pay ~$10 for one, but I think anything too much higher than that is ridiculous."

Let me bold some things for you.

[QUOTE=justin1992;23817158]Hey guys. Here is a simple thought.

If you don&#39;t like the game, or don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the amount of money it&#39;s being sold for, DON&#39;T FUCKING BUY IT. [B]We don&#39;t need any of your shit[/B], if you don&#39;t like it that&#39;s fine, [B]we don&#39;t give a damn[/B]. But please don&#39;t come in here and whine that [B]it&#39;s too expensive for your mommy to buy it for you, and therefore you think it&#39;s shit[/B]. [B]Just get out and don&#39;t bother us, go play something you think is worth the money, like WoW or MW2 or some stupid game[/B].[/QUOTE]

All the bolded parts are accusations or ad hominem. Both of which have no part in a civilized discussion.



To me, a game worth a fair bit of money is a game with either a strong plot and character development, which help you believe the story which gets you more and more involved, or a game with strong gameplay and a great online community. A sandbox game, at least in my eyes does not foot the bill. I&#39;m willing to pay ~$10 for one, but I think anything too much higher than that is ridiculous.[/QUOTE]

All the bolded parts are accusations or ad hominem. Both of which have no part in a civilized discussion.



To me, a game worth a fair bit of money is a game with either a strong plot and character development, which help you believe the story which gets you more and more involved, or a game with strong gameplay and a great online community. A sandbox game, at least in my eyes does not foot the bill. I&#39;m willing to pay ~$10 for one, but I think anything too much higher than that is ridiculous.[/QUOTE]

I have come to the conclusion you are only here to troll and piss the whole minecraft forum off to no end. I have decided not to respond to this in rage, but simply call you a troll and end it at that. Goodbye.</span>

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=justin1992;23817395]Yeah but see, this is the minecraft forum, not &quot;What&#39;s better, minecraft, or gmod?&quot; forum.

We are here to discuss MINECRAFT, not &quot;Well i think gmod is a better game than minecraft&quot; if you think that, go play gmod...we don&#39;t really care[/QUOTE]

It still pertains to Minecraft though, would you rather it go in the Garry&#39;s Mod subforum? It fits better in this thread.</span>
