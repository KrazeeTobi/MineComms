So its been a few days since I sealed that damn cave, everything was as it should be, no creepy ambience or anything like that, I farmed some bamboo and catus, everything was going great, I was able to play minecraft without it being creepy and terrifying.

I was running pretty low on cobblestone and iron, I knew that I&#39;d have to start mining again and I was pretty scared of mining directly into that cursed cave, or whatever it was.

I decided I would make a bigger base further away from my current one, so I knew I wouldnt come in contact with the cave ever. I was forced to clear out some trees for wood before leaving so I could make it out of wood. About a day later I was finished and was ready to start mining, I decided it would be best to make the mine part of my home, so I knew that it was part of my home and I always feel safest at home. So I began mining with my slightly damaged diamond pickaxe, I got further and further down, making a stairway on the way down, until I mined one block below me and fell into a very dark long cave, my heart skipped a beat, it couldnt be the same cave, could it? I immeadiately put about 5 torches all around me so I could see properly, I looked left to right, I havent been here before because there was a few blocks of iron, and I dont usually miss any iron blocks.

I was glad because I knew that I&#39;d be mining with iron pickaxes when my diamond one breaks, the fall into the cave did hurt though, but it was no major wound and I would be fine if I ran into any creatures down here, I quickly went down to my left into the dark abyss dropping the odd torch here and there to be safe until I hit a dead end. It was quite unusual because it was literally a dead end, a complete 3x3 square of rock, like it was put there as a seal.

It quickly stuck me that it was blocking off another cave network, the cursed cave, it couldn&#39;t be right? I mean I&#39;m far away from that place, I decided I would head back to where I fell in and go the other way to see what was down there, It looked longer and bigger than the other way so I left to get more torches, it also stuck me that non of my torches were dissapearing which made me feel safe, even though there was still a lot of unexplored darkness down there. I depositied all my cobblestone and made a few iron pickaxes to be safe so I could be down there longer. By this time it was night and I could see a few creepers outside but I was safe in my new home.

I descented back into the cave and down the dark path, lighting my way with the torches I had until it reached a big black drop, it was pretty deep and I would have had to have some way down but I had no cobblestone, instead of heading back to get some cobblestone from the chest, I just mined the rock around me which would be easier, maybe not faster but easier indeed.

I mined away unti I hit cobblestone, mossy cobblestone. I was quite excited because this would have been my first dungeon, I was prepared too since I had some cooked pork and a iron sword, I mined the cobblestone away to see nothing but darkness, I put down a torch and to my suprise it was completely empty, no monsters, just a few chests and a strange block in the center of the room, I was quite puzzled because I havent seen any monsters in this cave as of yet.. Whatever, I mined my way in to have a closer look at the strange block in the center of the room, it was like a fireplace, except there was something spinning inside of it, I had no idea what it was, it was like the letter L but backwards, with a static like texture, it was really strange because I would have suspected more of a challenge to get some pretty good items, I checked the first chest, completely empty which was disappointing, I turned around to check the other chest and there was this unusual item I&#39;ve never seen before. It was a black disk.

I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before, it had circle marks around it like a vinyl record, then all of the sudden I heard the single most creepiest cave ambience ever, it sent shivvers down my spine."
