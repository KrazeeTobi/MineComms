2: Open the occlusion image as a layer.
3: Change the occlusion layer mode to multiply.

1: Open your skin.
2: Open the occlusion image as a layer.
3: Change the occlusion layer mode to multiply.
4: Save the image as a PNG, merge visible layers.

I&#39;m not sure about the mode being multiply, play around with it until it looks right.</span>

Sorry, was replying to the post on top of the page. I am a slow poster.

But I can answer still! It depends on what you want. Do you want ores, or do you want stone? If you want ores, it is often wise to not mine it all. You basically make a grid, so that you can see the sides of all the squares without having to mine it all out. If you want a simple image, I can try to patch something together. Some other Facepuncher had great images of this way to mine, but I am not going to search through all the threads.

If you want stone you could just go nuts. I sometimes use stairs, sometimes use ladders. Depends on how much space you want to use."

A while back someone posted an efficient way to mine underground and I&#39;ve been using it since. You dig a tunnel 1x2, in other words, just big enough to walk through. Every third block you dig as far as your reach on either side of you like this:
[CODE]
XXXXXX XXXXXX   -Top-down view
XXXXXX XXXXXX
X           X
XXXXXX XXXXXX   -X is stuff, nothing is nothing
XXXXXX XXXXXX
X           X
XXXXXX XXXXXX
XXXXXX XXXXXX
[/CODE]

This allows you to see every ore in a 12 block wide space with the least digging, and of course if you spot a vein you can just dig it out and carry on.

Thanks to whoever showed this :v:"

Yeah, that&#39;s the best way to mine for ores. Other than finding caves that is. Thanks for putting that up!

Ok, question. On my main World, which I posted pictures of, I have an underground railway. I had it underground since there was no way of getting enough momentum to get anywhere, so I figured I could push the cart one way, and ride it the other. Now that we have motorized carts, I don&#39;t need it underground anymore. It can be mostly flat instead. So here&#39;s my question: Should I go and rip up all the old tracks and build a railway on the surface instead? That way you can actually see that it&#39;s there on overview maps. But doing that means ripping up over 200 tracks..."

No, travel will be very difficult, since your cart will slam into passing mobs, and the powered carts are bad at turns."
