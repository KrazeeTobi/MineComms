Stealing shit isn&#39;t griefing. Its getting vaulable things without working for them. Kind of like how it is in real life. Theres no problem with you killing them, thats defence, but vaulable things just aren&#39;t [b]vaulable unless you have a chance to lose them.[/b][/QUOTE]

what no
thats not how value works

Things are valuable because they&#39;re rare/unique/abnormal/cool. That&#39;s how it works.

What if players could &#39;reinforce&#39; their blocks by using iron or wood from their inventory and hitting a block with a wrench or something? 

That way you can create stronger houses, but it would be hard to box someone in because the other player could escape in the time it takes to reinforce every block.[/QUOTE]
That&#39;s a better way to think, if everything has a cost towards it you can&#39;t totally grief something to hell easy."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=krail9;23749567]Thats a good point, I didn&#39;t think of that. 

What if players could &#39;reinforce&#39; their blocks by using iron or wood from their inventory and hitting a block with a wrench or something? 

That way you can create stronger houses, but it would be hard to box someone in because the other player could escape in the time it takes to reinforce every block.[/QUOTE]
That&#39;s a better way to think, if everything has a cost towards it you can&#39;t totally grief something to hell easy.</span>

I didn&#39;t think it was steel, but it looks like steel and some people call it steel :colbert:

We should have steel though, as an intermediary between iron and diamond. You should burn logs or wood to make ash, which serves as a simplistic source of carbon, so you can craft it with iron to make steel."

I didn&#39;t think it was steel, but it looks like steel and some people call it steel :colbert:

We should have steel though, as an intermediary between iron and diamond. You should burn logs or wood to make ash, which serves as a simplistic source of carbon, so you can craft it with iron to make steel.</span>
