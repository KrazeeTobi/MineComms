                        <postrender input="SO in order to get the new blocks, I had to move my base further away. 
I have built what was initially an outpost.  However, a mine has churned up more than 50 blocks of diamond, and tons of gold.  It was relatively peaceful inside, with maybe a mob or two.  Outside was a stomping ground for creepers and skeletons...

The town of Fortuna (named after the roman goddess for fortune) was initially a small outpost with just goals for aquiring new exotic plants and elements.  However, the nearby mine churned up more precious metals than anticipated.  A grand railroad was built that spans between 1100&amp;#8594;1600 blocks to the east, which pushes approximately 2-3 trains to the capital city.  

Without further ado, I bring the pictures of the new prospective city.
[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/Zolofto/Minecraft/IsometricCityOfFortuna.png[/img]
Here we can see a small segment of the railroad that passes the locks to the empire(Lower left corner).  To the top right of the map, we can see the railroad going out of the city to the mine (not pictured)

[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/Zolofto/Minecraft/InfDevCityofFortuna.png[/img]
Here is the sea approach to the south of Fortuna.  We can see the old outpost center, and the newer buildings being constructed around the bay.  Including the new bathing house (building furthest to the left)

[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/Zolofto/Minecraft/InfDevFortunaMainRoad.png[/img]
This is the railroad approach coming from the mine.  Where the gravel processing center, and storage rooms can be seen.  It is anticipated for this area to develop more widly with a Cathedral being planned.

[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/Zolofto/Minecraft/InfDevFortunaRailroadHouse.png[/img]
Our final picture is the Railroad Shed.  There is 4 sidings for, you guessed it 4 trains.  Nothing too special, however a recent swarm of creepers took their toll to the building.

I&#39;ll post more on the forge dome (In the isometric, its the dome like building the furthest to the left of the city).  And maybe the very uninteresting monster trap which maybe one day, will lure something in."

                            <span v-pre>SO in order to get the new blocks, I had to move my base further away. 
I have built what was initially an outpost.  However, a mine has churned up more than 50 blocks of diamond, and tons of gold.  It was relatively peaceful inside, with maybe a mob or two.  Outside was a stomping ground for creepers and skeletons...

The town of Fortuna (named after the roman goddess for fortune) was initially a small outpost with just goals for aquiring new exotic plants and elements.  However, the nearby mine churned up more precious metals than anticipated.  A grand railroad was built that spans between 1100&amp;#8594;1600 blocks to the east, which pushes approximately 2-3 trains to the capital city.  

Without further ado, I bring the pictures of the new prospective city.

Here we can see a small segment of the railroad that passes the locks to the empire(Lower left corner).  To the top right of the map, we can see the railroad going out of the city to the mine (not pictured)

[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/Zolofto/Minecraft/InfDevCityofFortuna.png[/img]
Here is the sea approach to the south of Fortuna.  We can see the old outpost center, and the newer buildings being constructed around the bay.  Including the new bathing house (building furthest to the left)

[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/Zolofto/Minecraft/InfDevFortunaMainRoad.png[/img]
This is the railroad approach coming from the mine.  Where the gravel processing center, and storage rooms can be seen.  It is anticipated for this area to develop more widly with a Cathedral being planned.

[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v292/Zolofto/Minecraft/InfDevFortunaRailroadHouse.png[/img]
Our final picture is the Railroad Shed.  There is 4 sidings for, you guessed it 4 trains.  Nothing too special, however a recent swarm of creepers took their toll to the building.

I&#39;ll post more on the forge dome (In the isometric, its the dome like building the furthest to the left of the city).  And maybe the very uninteresting monster trap which maybe one day, will lure something in.</span>
