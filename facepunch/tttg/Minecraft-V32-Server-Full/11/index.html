Spiders scare the shit out of me at night, and finding creepers way underground is madness.

Also, I built a staircase down a mountain that goes all the way to the bottom (I think), after some mining I found a cavern that was filled to the brink with precious minerals, there I found for the first time gold, redstone and diamond sticking out of the walls. Then I proceeded to dig out one block to find ANOTHER set of 3 caverns all connecting holding even more minerals/horrors.

Right now I found some cobblestone with a weird green texture, and it appears there are monsters on the other side. Can anyone explain what this is before I try to dig through it? I already nearly drowned, got burned and exploded just trying to get there.

You found a dungeon. In the middle of it, there&#39;s a cage with fire in it. Break it so monsters stop spawning. There&#39;s also chests with cool items in there, so explore it once you&#39;ve got some decent equipment."

You found a dungeon. In the middle of it, there&#39;s a cage with fire in it. Break it so monsters stop spawning. There&#39;s also chests with cool items in there, so explore it once you&#39;ve got some decent equipment.</span>

                        <postrender input="I think i&#39;m going crazy.. I abandoned my mine due to strange shit happening, like blocks coming out of nowhere and my torches going missing, it was really strange.

The stranger thing was that there wasnt a single monster or slime or anything down there. But there was a lot of minerals. Quite a lot of cave ambience that I&#39;ve never heard before, must of been included in the friday update, I dunno.

But yeah, I abandoned it because it really creeped me out for some reason, the strange thing is though, I still hear the cave ambience quite far away from the mine.

But recently I&#39;ve been hearing really strange things around the building I built around it, it feels like whispers, its strange really... I feel like going back down there, but I really dont want to because of the creepy shit that happens down there plus I&#39;d need a lot more torches. It just seems that the cave is alive and angry at me.

I just decided to go down there one day, one last time to see if I could get any stuff that I could before really abandoning it, I couldnt find a single one of my torches that I left down there before I abandoned it, I dont know whats happening to them but fuck, this just made me want to leave the cave even more. I spent about 2 minutes inside and I noticed that I couldnt hear anything, the ambience stopped. 

At this point I was pretty creeped out and decided to leave before it went dark, I left and turned and looked at it then all of the sudden the hole went dark.. As if one of my torches was removed. I just fucking ran without looking back, I heard another creepy ambience sound while I ran away. I had to stop it all, the next day I heard another ambience noise that I havent heard before, but it was like someone was whispering something, it was drawing me towards the cave, but I just went further away from it.

I remembered I had a few buckets of lava left in a chest in my base so I decided I would flood it, but not while it was this dark so I waited the next day. While it was night, I went to the top of my wooden shack kind of thing to look around, just out of curiosity. I looked towards the creepy-as-fuck cave, I couldnt even look at it without getting creeped out, I thought I saw something in the window of the building over the cave, but it was probably just my eyes fucking with me.. I hope.

I went back into my shack until the sun came up, I was ready to rid the world of that fucking cave, I got my buckets of lava and a few water and started going towards the cave, I could already hear it talking to me, it knew what I was doing, I opened the cave opening and slowly walked in a little to the point where it was a drop, not too far into the cave and started to pour the lava down there, I cave it a minute before I poured water onto of it to seal it with obsidian, that should close it forever.

As I was doing this, I heard one final ambience, that suddenly stopped half way through.. As creepy as it sounded, I felt good because I knew it would be the last one I hear of that cave."

                            <span v-pre>I think i&#39;m going crazy.. I abandoned my mine due to strange shit happening, like blocks coming out of nowhere and my torches going missing, it was really strange.

The stranger thing was that there wasnt a single monster or slime or anything down there. But there was a lot of minerals. Quite a lot of cave ambience that I&#39;ve never heard before, must of been included in the friday update, I dunno.

But yeah, I abandoned it because it really creeped me out for some reason, the strange thing is though, I still hear the cave ambience quite far away from the mine.

But recently I&#39;ve been hearing really strange things around the building I built around it, it feels like whispers, its strange really... I feel like going back down there, but I really dont want to because of the creepy shit that happens down there plus I&#39;d need a lot more torches. It just seems that the cave is alive and angry at me.

I just decided to go down there one day, one last time to see if I could get any stuff that I could before really abandoning it, I couldnt find a single one of my torches that I left down there before I abandoned it, I dont know whats happening to them but fuck, this just made me want to leave the cave even more. I spent about 2 minutes inside and I noticed that I couldnt hear anything, the ambience stopped. 

At this point I was pretty creeped out and decided to leave before it went dark, I left and turned and looked at it then all of the sudden the hole went dark.. As if one of my torches was removed. I just fucking ran without looking back, I heard another creepy ambience sound while I ran away. I had to stop it all, the next day I heard another ambience noise that I havent heard before, but it was like someone was whispering something, it was drawing me towards the cave, but I just went further away from it.

I remembered I had a few buckets of lava left in a chest in my base so I decided I would flood it, but not while it was this dark so I waited the next day. While it was night, I went to the top of my wooden shack kind of thing to look around, just out of curiosity. I looked towards the creepy-as-fuck cave, I couldnt even look at it without getting creeped out, I thought I saw something in the window of the building over the cave, but it was probably just my eyes fucking with me.. I hope.

I went back into my shack until the sun came up, I was ready to rid the world of that fucking cave, I got my buckets of lava and a few water and started going towards the cave, I could already hear it talking to me, it knew what I was doing, I opened the cave opening and slowly walked in a little to the point where it was a drop, not too far into the cave and started to pour the lava down there, I cave it a minute before I poured water onto of it to seal it with obsidian, that should close it forever.

As I was doing this, I heard one final ambience, that suddenly stopped half way through.. As creepy as it sounded, I felt good because I knew it would be the last one I hear of that cave.</span>

The stranger thing was that there wasnt a single monster or slime or anything down there. But there was a lot of minerals. Quite a lot of cave ambience that I&#39;ve never heard before, must of been included in the friday update, I dunno.
 
But yeah, I abandoned it because it really creeped me out for some reason, the strange thing is though, I still hear the cave ambience quite far away from the mine.
 
But recently I&#39;ve been hearing really strange things around the building I built around it, it feels like whispers, its strange really... I feel like going back down there, but I really dont want to because of the creepy shit that happens down there plus I&#39;d need a lot more torches. It just seems that the cave is alive and angry at me.
 
I just decided to go down there one day, one last time to see if I could get any stuff that I could before really abandoning it, I couldnt find a single one of my torches that I left down there before I abandoned it, I dont know whats happening to them but fuck, this just made me want to leave the cave even more. I spent about 2 minutes inside and I noticed that I couldnt hear anything, the ambience stopped. 
 
At this point I was pretty creeped out and decided to leave before it went dark, I left and turned and looked at it then all of the sudden the hole went dark.. As if one of my torches was removed. I just fucking ran without looking back, I heard another creepy ambience sound while I ran away. I had to stop it all, the next day I heard another ambience noise that I havent heard before, but it was like someone was whispering something, it was drawing me towards the cave, but I just went further away from it.
 
I remembered I had a few buckets of lava left in a chest in my base so I decided I would flood it, but not while it was this dark so I waited the next day. While it was night, I went to the top of my wooden shack kind of thing to look around, just out of curiosity. I looked towards the creepy-as-fuck cave, I couldnt even look at it without getting creeped out, I thought I saw something in the window of the building over the cave, but it was probably just my eyes fucking with me.. I hope.
 
I went back into my shack until the sun came up, I was ready to rid the world of that fucking cave, I got my buckets of lava and a few water and started going towards the cave, I could already hear it talking to me, it knew what I was doing, I opened the cave opening and slowly walked in a little to the point where it was a drop, not too far into the cave and started to pour the lava down there, I cave it a minute before I poured water onto of it to seal it with obsidian, that should close it forever.
 
As I was doing this, I heard one final ambience, that suddenly stopped half way through.. As creepy as it sounded, I felt good because I knew it would be the last one I hear of that cave.[/QUOTE]
