There is a file named level.dat_OLD in the save folder, try replacing level.dat with that by removing the _OLD from it.
 
Go on, try it.</span>

Yea, exactly. If I catch somebody in my house and they say &quot;lol, i&#39;m a thief!&quot; they&#39;re gonna die. Then i&#39;m going to take all of their things that they had on them, and if anybody asks, he tried to steal my stuff.

It finished, the sound went static. I was lost, what did I just listen to? It was like someone took the sound of 1000 dying miners and solidified it into this disk...

The vinyl needs to be destroyed, maybe this is the source of all of this... This wierd stuff comes from this disk. I need to destroy it, it has to be destroyed

I need to throw it into a pit of lava, but the only lava I&#39;ve ever found was in that cave.. I can&#39;t go back there, I don&#39;t have enough time to find another cave, it will just be a waste of time

I can&#39;t go back to that place, can I? I mean.. If I take enough torches to get to lava and destroy it

What about those eyes? What if I see them again? What if I get close to them?

I really can&#39;t do this, not by myself but I have to. What if I was just seeing things? What if it wasnt really there? Yeah, thats what it is, my mind was playing tricks thats all. I&#39;m going there next sunrise and I&#39;m going to make it out at sun set, I am destroying that disk.

I have to prepare, I open my nearly-empty chest, the only things in the chest are a few blocks of cobblestone, 2 iron pickaxes and some wood, I think I have enough torches to get me there and back. I think I&#39;m ready, theres nothing else I need. 

The sun is starting to come up, I have to make my move now so I dont waste any time so I can get out as early as possible, I grab the disk and start running towards the house I quickly open the door and close it, its dark and the only light is coming from the two windows next to the door

All of a sudden I hear a voice, its coming from the disk and it wants to go back to its chest, its trying to reason with me. I will not listen! I light up the room with a torch, I need to make sure I dont use too many. I enter the mining room and slowly decend to the cursed cave, I look back up to darkness, the torches are still disappearing

I get into the cave, begin slowly going towards the pit, making sure I use my torches efficiently, I hear a ghoulish laugh behind me, in the pitch black and two white eyes were there. Looking at me I freeze, I can&#39;t move I&#39;m locked into a staring contest with the eyes, I hear whispers, from all around me telling me to go closer, I can&#39;t... I must resist

I turn and run, using torch after torch. Forgetting that I have a limited supply until I reach the pit, nearly falling in. I grab the wall as I nearly lose balance. I put a final torch down and take a quick look behind me, there was still a few torches up, not being broken. I couldnt see the eyes, which was a good thing I guess. I can see the dungeon from here, so very dark

What if.. I do put the disk back? What if it all stopped? What if we could make a deal.. Did I just say we? What is going on with me?! I need to destory this disk

I throw a few cobblestone blocks down until I can slowly step down, before I can put a torch down, I see the eyes again, in the pit looking up at me. The music begins to play again, in my head. I want it to stop!

I hear whispers in the music, cries for help. They want to be back in the chest where its peaceful. No they can be free! I&#39;m destroying that disk

I realize I&#39;m in complete darkness, I put down a torch and look back into the pit, the eyes are closer, bigger...

I put down another torch, look back and they&#39;re gone. I&#39;m seeing things, I know I am they cant be real. I get further down, I can see light, it has to be the lava! I&#39;m so close! I can barely believe it.

I get to the bottom, I can see lava in the distance, I run towards it, disk in hand then suddenly, I stop. I cant go any further, the disk wont let me. What am I doing? I cant destroy this, I mean..

What am I doing? I cant destroy this... I need to put it back in the chest. Yes, back to resting for you little disk, just up these stairs and we&#39;ll have you back home..

I&#39;m a good miner aren&#39;t I? We&#39;ve been through alot, we don&#39;t want that to end do we? No we don&#39;t

Here, we&#39;re home. You&#39;re home back where you belong. 

What did I just do? What have I done?! The dungeons sealed! This can&#39;t be happening! This can&#39;t be how it ends! Its getting warm in here.. So warm.. Its burning, why is it so hot?

I just wanted to live...
