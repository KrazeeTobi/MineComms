Part 3

I knew I had to get out immeadiately, I look around to the exit, as I do I noticed a 1x2 hole in the wall which strangely wasnt there before.. What the fuck is going on

I put down a torch so I could inspect the hole further, I knew I had to get out of there but.. I just couldnt strangely enough, I got closer to the hole and looked around, it was dark, empty, it was the cursed cave.

I blocked the hole with cobblestone and turn to make my way out, I exit the dungeon into the 3x3 corridor which was pitch black. The torches were gone. 

I look back to the dungeon, the torch was gone, the only light was coming from the torch by my foot, then another loud cave ambience came from in front of me, it mocking me, laughing, I was terrified, I couldnt move but I knew I had to get out of here and go as far away as possible from this terrible place.

I start running, placing as many torches as possible on the walls to keep in the light, I could see the light of my stairway, I rushed up to my now-cursed home ran outside and kept running away, thats all I could do. I got far away, but my house was in seeing distance, I looked closer and the door was closed. The door which was open, closed.

I couldnt go further, I wanted to be able to see it, making sure it didnt change.. Or anything else.

I build a makeshift shack which faced my old home, I liked to look at it, I dont know why but I enjoyed viewing it. Then all the sudden I remembered that strange disk I found in the cave, it must be a vinyl and I had to play it, maybe it was something to do with the cave.

I thought about how I could craft something to play it, then I remembered that my stuff was back at my house, I didnt want to go back but I had to. I knew that if I had something like a chip of diamond it might be able to play the vinyl. I had a few chips of diamond back there which would work. I went outside, it was getting dark but I couldnt last another night with this mystery scarred onto my mind, I had to find out.

I just ran, I didnt look out for any monsters I just ran straight for my home. I just wanted to go in, get the things I need and leave and never go back.

I got to the door, still closed. The whole house was dark, the torches were gone. I opened the first chest near the door and I managed to get out a few pieces of wood and a few cobble stone, but no diamond. I must have put it on the mining room...

I slowly go towards the door which seperated my house from the mine and opened it, the sound of the door opened creeked and echoed throughout the mine, I felt like just running away but I had to get the diamond, I opened the chest and got the bits of diamond that I had, I couldnt resist just having a peek down into the mine. I slowly poke my head down, it was dark, nothing could be seen... Except for 2 white dots, next to each other like eyes.

Something was down there, looking into my eyes, I felt like I was looking at death itself. I went dizzy and fell backwards into a solid object, the door which was open just seconds ago. I bashed my way through it and through the other door outside, it was still night but I didnt care, I ran back to my shack with my heart pounding my chest like it wanted to escape life.

I got in and closed my door, destroyed my windows, the door, everything that could let me see the outside world and placed as many torches as possible. I didnt want to see any darkness again, I went into a corner and sat there terrified. Why me? Why didnt this happen to anybody else.

I didnt want to do anything else until the sun came up, I couldnt even tell if it was day yet, I just sat there in fear until I heard a sign that it was day, the baaah of a sheep, it was a welcoming sound. I used my diamond pickaxe to break away what used to be the door, as I did it broke into several piecs, it served me well.

The first thing I did when I got outside was look at that horrible place, it was closed.. I could see the darkness through the windows, I didnt want to look.. What if something was watching me from there?

I went back inside and started work on my device to play this disk, after a few minutes I made something stable that was able to play it. I got the disk and looked at it, it was dark and didnt reflect any light, I knew this thing was evil.

I put the disk inside the machine, it started to play...

I like to look at my pictures without having to open 20 new tabs that take 10 seconds to load each and i will look at for 2 seconds and close again.

I don&#39;t get why people have to whine about having to scroll over half a centimeter. You don&#39;t even need to scroll to see the rest, everything you need to see can be seen right there..."
