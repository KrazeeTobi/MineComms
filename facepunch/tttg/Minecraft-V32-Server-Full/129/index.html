                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=aero1444;23811851]I suggest the best way to do it is to build a storeroom under your house where you can place full blocks of metals. 
Only pick up what you need, and remember where ores etc. are in caves so you can come back for them later.

e.g. if you need 40 planks, only pick up 10 logs, and remember to re-plant trees. I have decided my first job is to build a tree farm, for people to use, as long as they re-plant the trees and don&#39;t steal the torches.[/QUOTE]

That&#39;s what i was about to say but...Do chests not work/save server side? If so you can make a hidden chest built into your floor with something like a couch over it...Or just cobblestone/wood like the rest of your floor/walls if you prefer so no one can just loot your stuff.

If not make a secret storage room like you said where, when you log off, you place everything in your inventory, full blocks of metal, dirt, gravel, all of your torches, anything you can...and for stuff you can&#39;t place, like tools, well...When you&#39;re building never make more then you need so that you never have to worry about things disappearing when you log out. Most of that was probably common sense but meh, just figured I&#39;d post my ideas.."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=aero1444;23811851]I suggest the best way to do it is to build a storeroom under your house where you can place full blocks of metals. 
Only pick up what you need, and remember where ores etc. are in caves so you can come back for them later.

e.g. if you need 40 planks, only pick up 10 logs, and remember to re-plant trees. I have decided my first job is to build a tree farm, for people to use, as long as they re-plant the trees and don&#39;t steal the torches.[/QUOTE]

That&#39;s what i was about to say but...Do chests not work/save server side? If so you can make a hidden chest built into your floor with something like a couch over it...Or just cobblestone/wood like the rest of your floor/walls if you prefer so no one can just loot your stuff.

If not make a secret storage room like you said where, when you log off, you place everything in your inventory, full blocks of metal, dirt, gravel, all of your torches, anything you can...and for stuff you can&#39;t place, like tools, well...When you&#39;re building never make more then you need so that you never have to worry about things disappearing when you log out. Most of that was probably common sense but meh, just figured I&#39;d post my ideas..</span>

Before I start wasting wood on building more of these houses for the village, I figured I could use some suggestions/tips/etc. The inside is pretty much just a basement made out of cobblestone, two wooden floors above that and a roof, so I figured I didn&#39;t need to take any pictures of them, but if you feel it is necessary, I will."

Not soon, when the game is ready to be sold. Get a friend to buy it for you? And there will be creative MP, just for paid users.


also, IDEA!
inside your walls, dig a huge pit 3 blocks wide, with lava at the bottom. It&#39;d require a 5 block wide wall but it&#39;d be useful for city/castle walls.
[code]
SSSSS
S___S
S___S
S___S
D___D
D___D
D___D
DLLLD
[/code]
like that. if someone tried to dig their way in, they&#39;d fall in the pit, and they wouldn&#39;t be able to dig from the inside and release the lava because of the pit.

OR have a cactus floor, like
[code]
(top down)

C_C_C_C
_C_C_C_
C_C_C_C

[/code]

or line the underground part of the wall with obsidian? dunno how you would defend the top of your wall though, cause people could climb over."

And I am not able to pay for anything via the interwebs, so I can not be buying it... Meh.

Do you have any idea as to when this is going to happen? I will try to finish what I wanted to create beforehand.[/QUOTE]

Not soon, when the game is ready to be sold. Get a friend to buy it for you? And there will be creative MP, just for paid users.


also, IDEA!
inside your walls, dig a huge pit 3 blocks wide, with lava at the bottom. It&#39;d require a 5 block wide wall but it&#39;d be useful for city/castle walls.
[code]
SSSSS

[/code]
like that. if someone tried to dig their way in, they&#39;d fall in the pit, and they wouldn&#39;t be able to dig from the inside and release the lava because of the pit.

OR have a cactus floor, like
[code]
(top down)

C_C_C_C
_C_C_C_
C_C_C_C

[/code]

or line the underground part of the wall with obsidian? dunno how you would defend the top of your wall though, cause people could climb over.</span>
