1. Download [url=http://thefwcentral.com/upload/content/other/ijc856991.class]this file[/url], save as ij.class.
2. Open minecraft.jar (located in %appdata%/.minecraft/bin) with 7-zip or WinRAR.
3. Drag and drop the new file in.
4. [b]Delete the META-INF folder.[/b] This is [b][u]very[/u][/b] important.
5. Play! (In the standalone client)

If you want to play in the browser again or don&#39;t care about such higher quality textures, just delete the bin folder and the normal jars will be redownloaded.[/QUOTE]

Oh wow, thanks. :woop:</span>

What the fuck good is a house?  Like, why are people planning on making housing at all?

There&#39;s no real essential functions a building needs beyond an eight block floor space interior for a large chest, workbench, forge, lava pit (disposal), a torch on a wall, and the remaining room to move.  Even if beds were implemented, it would barely go up in size, probably only by two/three blocks.

You can say it&#39;s so people can have places of their own to customize...but isn&#39;t that the entire purpose of the city?  Somebody wants a little place of their own they&#39;ll probably build some random structure in the city proper, not specifically a house, and it&#39;ll likely contain all the same amenities during and after construction.  I mean, it&#39;s eight blocks, assuming every building won&#39;t have everything a person needs in it is asinine.[/QUOTE]

Roleplay. People want to pretend its like a real city, and Notch will probably add some bed function and others. They also want a place to put their belongings, crafting stuff, and whatever other blocks Notch adds.</span>

Well, that makes sense, though it&#39;s also a bit disappointing.  You&#39;d figure a bunch of creative folk could transcend the traditional trappings of an urban center, but if people want to pretend they&#39;re average joes in blockword, w/e."
