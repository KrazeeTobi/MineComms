I just stopped with my pictures because the wiki now has basic diagrams up, and pretty much everyone&#39;s on the same page as far as the basic gates are concerned.  There&#39;s room to put in the new tiny SR NOR latch, NAND latch, and XOR, though.[/QUOTE]

Well, my plan was just to create a easy diagram for people who are unfamiliar with logic could understand it better, and have easy access to it in the OP.
Currently I&#39;m planning on adding
NOT, OR, AND, NOR, NAND, XOR, and XNOR, but I could add others, such as the ones you suggested, and Flip-Flops and such."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Xenocidebot;23141497]I covered the basics on 16 and was considering making a tutoral video, but if you want to make your own go ahead.

I just stopped with my pictures because the wiki now has basic diagrams up, and pretty much everyone&#39;s on the same page as far as the basic gates are concerned.  There&#39;s room to put in the new tiny SR NOR latch, NAND latch, and XOR, though.[/QUOTE]

Well, my plan was just to create a easy diagram for people who are unfamiliar with logic could understand it better, and have easy access to it in the OP.
Currently I&#39;m planning on adding
NOT, OR, AND, NOR, NAND, XOR, and XNOR, but I could add others, such as the ones you suggested, and Flip-Flops and such.</span>

Just going to say, the wiki is incredibly good at demonstrating the gate designs. They&#39;re very clear:

It doesn&#39;t have a flip-flop, but it [b]does[/b] have a &quot;RS NOR Latch&quot; which does the same thing.

If a short tutorial were written about logic gates though, for people unfamiliar with them, that would be good (nearly missed this reading your post)."

Yeah, I&#39;m wondering the same thing. I&#39;ve played this game a lot since I bought it recently and every cavern I find has a little bit of coal and iron, might branch off a few times, but it just ends. I found 1 block of gold once, and have never found lava or diamond. Do I need to dig through the dead ends or something?"

Yeah, I&#39;m wondering the same thing. I&#39;ve played this game a lot since I bought it recently and every cavern I find has a little bit of coal and iron, might branch off a few times, but it just ends. I found 1 block of gold once, and have never found lava or diamond. Do I need to dig through the dead ends or something?</span>

You have to dig deep. Aim for lava spots since sometimes they have diamonds within the area, and large caverns should be explored since they provide easily obtainable iron ores. Mining for the most part is hit or miss, sometimes you get a hotspot and sometimes you only get rock."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=DOG-GY;23142078]See his thread on trying to get all into the survivalmp server and have some &quot;important&quot; position. Then when his thread gets shot down, he tries to take over the better smp city thread and clog it with his awful ideas. Again, trying to put himself in a position because he thinks it&#39;s a huge deal.

Finally he&#39;s been spamming up here with shit posts and such. Like the one about how &quot;That Ninja&quot; apparently has a username that&#39;s close to someone else called &quot;That Nigger&quot;

He doesn&#39;t think before he posts.[/QUOTE]

My bad. I don&#39;t pay attention to the city thread.

But people started votebanning him when he came in and I saw someone filling his house with opcrete on venn&#39;s server.

I just don&#39;t see why it has to go that far.</span>
