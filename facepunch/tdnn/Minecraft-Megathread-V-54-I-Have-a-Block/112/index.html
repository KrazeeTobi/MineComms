Which is what you are doing

I like how you do it, then come here and exaggerate and brag about how great you are and about how butthurt everyone gets to get some sort of validation. Its like you need the attention to full some self esteem issue[/QUOTE]
 
You are pretty much right in the first and second paragraphs. First, it may annoy you or anger you if I kill you or take your things, but it isn&#39;t against the rules.

Second, this server is where I go to cool down. I find it very relaxing to settle down and kill people. The butt-hurtness is just informing, or telling others that they probably shouldn&#39;t do that, as it annoys everyone in the server. 

I do tend to get a bit over-excited in the heat of the battle, and tend to tell others that I happened to win, and there is really no excuse for that. I&#39;m sorry it annoyed you or anyone else, but that&#39;s changing the subject away from the main topic that you presented at first.

Here&#39;s how it works, and hopefully ends the ragebath here: Everyone likes different servers, and everyone reacts differently to killing or being killed. Griefing on that server is only griefing with lava or water."

no, grieifing is going out to annoy or anger others. Bannable grieifing is the use of water or lava.
I like how you completely skip the part where you are called out for having low self esteem, then proceed to backpedal OMG IM SO SORRY I HURT UR FEELINGS DOOD

I have no excuse for posting anything about killing anyone on this thread, and if I reeeallly want to, I&#39;ll post something on the mineville thread that I just realized existed, or post something funny on the server that is not related to PvP here.

Even with this apology, this does not mean that anyone should be whining about dying, and on the other hand, being a &quot;pompous ass&quot; on this thread.

We can keep the drama on the mineville thread and not bother anyone else here.

About griefing, it&#39;s a simple fact: Deal with it. If I were the victim, I would not whine on the thread about it or complain, but I may just possibly do so if it was against the rules on the server, and proper action was not taken.

                            <span v-pre>Lets not let this bleed into the minecraft megathread here. I&#39;m acting this way on this server, and on other servers, I may be friendly and everything. I have no excuse for posting anything about killing anyone on this thread, and if I reeeallly want to, I&#39;ll post something on the mineville thread that I just realized existed, or post something funny on the server that is not related to PvP here.

Even with this apology, this does not mean that anyone should be whining about dying, and on the other hand, being a &quot;pompous ass&quot; on this thread.

We can keep the drama on the mineville thread and not bother anyone else here.

About griefing, it&#39;s a simple fact: Deal with it. If I were the victim, I would not whine on the thread about it or complain, but I may just possibly do so if it was against the rules on the server, and proper action was not taken.

basically you just said no psycho babble allowed GTFO I don&#39;t want you calling out
