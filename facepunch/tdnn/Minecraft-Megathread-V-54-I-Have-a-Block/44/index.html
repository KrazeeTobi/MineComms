you have heard me being pissed at notch for this server shit
no one else seems to have the problem.
Ill be playing, then all the sudden, the blocks will start reversing, and my internet will crash.
Ill be disconnected (obviously) and then I have to manually reconnect the ethernet cable
I know it isnt my router, as I tried doing it direct and nothing changed.
I know it isnt my modem, because I tried out a friends.
I know it isnt another process interfering, I ended all but the essential ones and javaw.exe
This doesnt happen with any other game.
I used said friend&#39;s computer and tried with the same server, he did not have this problem.
I am on windows xp service pack 3.
months ago, my internet got zapped by lightning, even with the surge protector, and hit my computer.
ethernet port had no visable damage, and would not work even after reinstalling mobo drivers.
so we replaced the surge protector with something a LOT better, and got a network card.
it is a TRENDNET pci 1gb card.
Ive even done a full reinstall of windows. nothing works.
is this notchs fault, and if so, explain to me in what mind would he have to be in to not hire proper auth server coders.

prepare to have a wall of text.
you have heard me being pissed at notch for this server shit
no one else seems to have the problem.
Ill be playing, then all the sudden, the blocks will start reversing, and my internet will crash.
Ill be disconnected (obviously) and then I have to manually reconnect the ethernet cable
I know it isnt my router, as I tried doing it direct and nothing changed.
I know it isnt my modem, because I tried out a friends.
I know it isnt another process interfering, I ended all but the essential ones and javaw.exe
This doesnt happen with any other game.
I used said friend&#39;s computer and tried with the same server, he did not have this problem.
I am on windows xp service pack 3.
months ago, my internet got zapped by lightning, even with the surge protector, and hit my computer.
ethernet port had no visable damage, and would not work even after reinstalling mobo drivers.
so we replaced the surge protector with something a LOT better, and got a network card.
it is a TRENDNET pci 1gb card.
Ive even done a full reinstall of windows. nothing works.
is this notchs fault, and if so, explain to me in what mind would he have to be in to not hire proper auth server coders.

 No one else that I can talk to seems to have this problem. 
the ones who DID, keyword, were able to fix it because they have some other card, Antheros, or w/e.
anything from packet buffers to protocols, all that they had that fixed their situation did not work on me.
