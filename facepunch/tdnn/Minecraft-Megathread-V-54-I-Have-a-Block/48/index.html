Deal with it, oh how original and helpful. Raiding and Griefing are two ENTIRELY different things.

Raiding would be destroying my base by taking all valuables that I have stored in my base, as in, if I had a diamond block somewhere in my base, he would take that, or simply just taking stuff out of chests. He didn&#39;t raid my base, he griefed it. How can you not see this? What is the reason you have water flooding as a rule? Because it&#39;s hard to clean up? Because it destroys a lot of stuff? How is spamming blocks any different? Lava I can understand why it&#39;s different, fire and all that, but it&#39;s not any different that water flooding, in fact it&#39;s easier to deal with water flooding than spamming blocks because you can just remove the source block of the water and blamo.

If you think it should be, ask Nerdy privately instead of whining to the rest of the server or thread.[/QUOTE]
 
I tried to ask Nerdy privately but you guys kept intruding. I&#39;m not going to add him on Steam, and I wasn&#39;t going to make or ask him to add it to the rules as I&#39;m not going on his server anymore.

[QUOTE=Barrowsx;27490653]Okay. If you don&#39;t like his server, then why do you play on it? Are you one of those people who just likes to bitch and moan about everything?[/QUOTE]
 
Because his server is the only one I don&#39;t lag on.</span>
