That&#39;s no problem. You may see PvPing people as jerks, I see them as a fun challenge. There are different servers for different people. Some people enjoy getting some people together to form kingdoms and alliances, and there are people like me that just raid and kill for fun. It&#39;s not your sort of server, but hey. You didn&#39;t whine about it, did you?"

People don&#39;t understand the roleplay aspect. They just spawn and start chasing people. They may not be spawnkilling but they&#39;re just like bots.[/QUOTE]
 
It&#39;s not a RP server, and I usually don&#39;t play it that way. I simply get my fix of adrenaline by wandering around, making enemies, and thus creating interesting combat scenarios, which I love. Some people do play it like a role-play server and have the thieve&#39;s guild and such.</span>

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Chezhead;27555907]Griefing is defined in the terms of the server. In this one, it is griefing with water or lava. It is a PvP server, and really anything goes. It is a perfect &quot;excuse&quot; to do anything you want. PvP would not be PvP without players destroying other players.

Don&#39;t like PvP? Butthurt about being killed? Don&#39;t be in the server! Simple as that?[/QUOTE]
 
No grieifing is doing something specifically to annoy or anger other people. No one can change that definition
Which is what you are doing

I like how you do it, then come here and exaggerate and brag about how great you are and about how butthurt everyone gets to get some sort of validation. Its like you need the attention to fuel some self esteem issue</span>
