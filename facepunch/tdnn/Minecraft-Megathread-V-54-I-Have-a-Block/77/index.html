Minecraft &quot;Survival&quot; Is a game where you start in a randomly generated area which never ends, you may edit the landscape as you wish, using the resources you get from it to create tools, houses and whatever you may want to create.

The game sets you in a world without any goals and you can do pretty much whatever you want. 
The world is also fully &quot;reformable&quot;, as it consists of blocks that can be taken and placed back at will.

The &quot;creative&quot; mode, which is now very outdated, is basically only about building: you can place and take blocks without any kind of a delay and without a need for crafting tools.
The &quot;survival&quot; mode, which is now in Beta, is the most recent version of the game, and includes near-infinite worlds, crafting, refining, spelunking, et cetera. In this gamemode you use tools to gather resources and your main goal is to survive - and at the same time, build your dream base with whatever you can find.

The reason he was exploring the cave in that video was most likely for resources. To get ores like iron and coal, you often have to go a bit underground. Diamond, on the other hand, can only be found in the deepest places of the world.
Why get ores? They can be used for tools, decorations and, in multiplayer, even currency.

If you&#39;re looking for a preset goal or reason you should go and explore, you may be a bit dissapointed. Or relieved. You set your own goals and targets, which is one of the reasons Minecraft is so addicting - it&#39;s not repetitive if you have a good imagination.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Dragory;27518100]The game sets you in a world without any goals and you can do pretty much whatever you want. 
The world is also fully &quot;reformable&quot;, as it consists of blocks that can be taken and placed back at will.

The &quot;creative&quot; mode, which is now very outdated, is basically only about building: you can place and take blocks without any kind of a delay and without a need for crafting tools.
The &quot;survival&quot; mode, which is now in Beta, is the most recent version of the game, and includes near-infinite worlds, crafting, refining, spelunking, et cetera. In this gamemode you use tools to gather resources and your main goal is to survive - and at the same time, build your dream base with whatever you can find.

The reason he was exploring the cave in that video was most likely for resources. To get ores like iron and coal, you often have to go a bit underground. Diamond, on the other hand, can only be found in the deepest places of the world.
Why get ores? They can be used for tools, decorations and, in multiplayer, even currency.

If you&#39;re looking for a preset goal or reason you should go and explore, you may be a bit dissapointed. Or relieved. You set your own goals and targets, which is one of the reasons Minecraft is so addicting - it&#39;s not repetitive if you have a good imagination.

Minecraft is only purchasable through [url=http://www.minecraft.net/]minecraft.net[/url]. There are no retail copies available, and you need to use PayPal for the purchase.
After you&#39;ve bought the game (15&amp;#8364; at the moment), you can play it either on the website or on the downloadable client. Both work, although the client offers some extras like better modding capabilities (some mods have reported not working on the browser version).

And last, there is a very outdated free version of the survival mode (or is there anymore? Not sure) that you can try, but it doesn&#39;t include half of the features of the full game. You can also try the creative mode, but that, then again, is not at all like the survival mode.

If you&#39;re wondering whether you&#39;ll get your money&#39;s worth, then the answer is [b]yes[/b]. I haven&#39;t yet met a single person who hasn&#39;t liked Minecraft after buying it. And often they like it much more than the $60 blockbusters.

My recommendation? Buy it. It&#39;s damn worth it.[/QUOTE]
 
Wow thanks for the info. I&#39;m really considering getting this game now. Sounds awesome.</span>
