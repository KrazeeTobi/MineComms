Slash was griefing, and the fact that you can&#39;t notice that is amazing. I wouldn&#39;t of cared if he just stole my stuff then left. No, he griefed my base by spamming trees and blocks everywhere, and then he [b]gave my stuff back[/b], that is purely and positively griefing. Griefing is basically when someone does something only to annoy you, make you mad, or ruin your gaming experience. The fact that you of all people can&#39;t see this is amazing. They brought up a point that he wanted revenge or some stupid shit, when I had never done anything to him. 

Nerdy, you need to take yourself and your players back to 4chan, because your server is made up of trolls and griefers. Excluding chezhead and a few others who came from FP.[/QUOTE]

I get your point on him kicking you, but I think he just wanted to &quot;kick&quot; some sense into you to get you to stop whining. We&#39;re all happy, by the way, so the server is run well. Running a server is making people happy, and you are the one person that is upset. Every idea has a hater.

I gave stolen goods back to people after murdering them as a tasteful, honorable way of fighting. That&#39;s not griefing. Griefing varies from server to server, and on this server, using water or lava to mess with people is the only form of it. That was not done in this case.

If the server is made up of trolls and griefers, I&#39;ve never seen a single one. Trolling and griefing in your case is stealth, murder, and espionage, which seems to be getting you up in a riot. The server is great, but hey. It&#39;s all an opinion."

I get your point on him kicking you, but I think he just wanted to &quot;kick&quot; some sense into you to get you to stop whining. We&#39;re all happy, by the way, so the server is run well. Running a server is making people happy, and you are the one person that is upset. Every idea has a hater.

[QUOTE=Eeshton;27490117]
Slash was griefing, and the fact that you can&#39;t notice that is amazing. I wouldn&#39;t of cared if he just stole my stuff then left. No, he griefed my base by spamming trees and blocks everywhere, and then he [b]gave my stuff back[/b], that is purely and positively griefing. Griefing is basically when someone does something only to annoy you, make you mad, or ruin your gaming experience. The fact that you of all people can&#39;t see this is amazing. They brought up a point that he wanted revenge or some stupid shit, when I had never done anything to him. [/quote]

I gave stolen goods back to people after murdering them as a tasteful, honorable way of fighting. That&#39;s not griefing. Griefing varies from server to server, and on this server, using water or lava to mess with people is the only form of it. That was not done in this case. 

[QUOTE=Eeshton;27490117]Nerdy, you need to take yourself and your players back to 4chan, because your server is made up of trolls and griefers. Excluding chezhead and a few others who came from FP.[/QUOTE]

If the server is made up of trolls and griefers, I&#39;ve never seen a single one. Trolling and griefing in your case is stealth, murder, and espionage, which seems to be getting you up in a riot. The server is great, but hey. It&#39;s all an opinion.</span>

If that is not griefing then you don&#39;t know what it is. Griefing does not vary from server to server, the rules vary, just because an admin isn&#39;t smart enough to see when griefing is happening doesn&#39;t mean I am wrong. When Slash was still on everytime I tried to talk to him seriously he would just reply with C:, even when what I was saying had nothing to do with anything that happened, this is clearly where he was trying to annoy me.

I don&#39;t hate Nerdy&#39;s server or it&#39;s ideas. I hate the admin who can&#39;t notice griefing at it&#39;s finest. I always had a feeling that he had something against me when he sent my comrade at the time to kill me for 3 diamonds, dumbass couldn&#39;t tell we faked it.[/QUOTE]
 
It&#39;s PvP. Raiding is enabled. There are no rules except for not griefing with water or lava. Simple as that.
