I love Computercraft. I wrote a a simple depth-first path finding algorithm for turtles and a whole lot of utility programs for them including a central server that every turtle asks for updates on boot. That way I can fix a bug in the digging script and every single turtle I use near my base will automatically get the bugfix on boot. I also wrote a script for replacing the floor, ceiling or walls with different blocks. It just digs away one layer and places whatever I want instead. Very simple, but very useful. Especially since you don&#39;t have to enter any coordinates or distances since it all works with GPS and I just have to place it on each end of the area and call the command."
