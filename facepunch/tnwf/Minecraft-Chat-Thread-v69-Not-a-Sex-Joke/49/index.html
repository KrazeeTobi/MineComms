                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=RenegadeCop;38241877]Well what if you could only have one element at a time, with 4 spells?  If you&#39;ve ever played guild wars 2, kind&#39;ve like how the elementalist works.

To change elements, you need to find a oblesks and sacrifice certain items for certain elements.

Fire would be destruction and have lava attacks
Water would be healing and have water attacks
Earth would be defensive and utility (rising colomns of stone?)
Air would be speed and utility

Or you could do light/dark, with light being utility like spells that help with building/healing/farming and whatnot.   While dark would be attack spells like poisoning mobs/shooting energy balls or something.

Just ideas off the top of my head.  And for balance, each element could come with a weakness.  Or a pro/con kinda thing.  Like being able to swim in lava, but losing the ability to swim in water.[/QUOTE]
 
The mod I mentioned above might inspire you. Here were some of the things you could do.
Water:Breath underwater, 
Earth: Conjure(spawn a shit ton of food), 
Fire:Cast fire balls, become immune to fire/lava, cast lightening, fire ripple effect around you.
Air: Jump really high and take no fall damage from it, knock people back.

There was more to each ability but unfortunately you had to grind XP to reach levels in order to obtain a new skill for what ever element you chose. I only got to use fire, earth, and air. I would have reached higher levels but an update broke the plug-in."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=RenegadeCop;38241877]Well what if you could only have one element at a time, with 4 spells?  If you&#39;ve ever played guild wars 2, kind&#39;ve like how the elementalist works.

To change elements, you need to find a oblesks and sacrifice certain items for certain elements.

Fire would be destruction and have lava attacks
Water would be healing and have water attacks
Earth would be defensive and utility (rising colomns of stone?)
Air would be speed and utility

Or you could do light/dark, with light being utility like spells that help with building/healing/farming and whatnot.   While dark would be attack spells like poisoning mobs/shooting energy balls or something.

Just ideas off the top of my head.  And for balance, each element could come with a weakness.  Or a pro/con kinda thing.  Like being able to swim in lava, but losing the ability to swim in water.[/QUOTE]
 
The mod I mentioned above might inspire you. Here were some of the things you could do.
Water:Breath underwater, 
Earth: Conjure(spawn a shit ton of food), 
Fire:Cast fire balls, become immune to fire/lava, cast lightening, fire ripple effect around you.
Air: Jump really high and take no fall damage from it, knock people back.

There was more to each ability but unfortunately you had to grind XP to reach levels in order to obtain a new skill for what ever element you chose. I only got to use fire, earth, and air. I would have reached higher levels but an update broke the plug-in.</span>

definitely. would anyone complain if I just ditched vanilla xp in favor of weapons and skills that give the same effects?

[quote]Weapons have damage type. Bludgeoning, piercing, slicing, etc. Certain armors would protect against certain damage types. Mobs would also have set resistances to certain types.

More expansive weapon choices than provided by vanilla mine craft. (TES route? Types? Forging?) Same with armor.

Mobs also have damage types. Spider would be piercing, zombie would be bludgeoning, etc.[/quote]"

As for arrows: Some for piercing that go through the enemy, some for blunt knockback that bounce off, and maybe direct upgrades of those types that cause DoT elemental damage.[/QUOTE]

definitely. would anyone complain if I just ditched vanilla xp in favor of weapons and skills that give the same effects?

[quote]Weapons have damage type. Bludgeoning, piercing, slicing, etc. Certain armors would protect against certain damage types. Mobs would also have set resistances to certain types.

More expansive weapon choices than provided by vanilla mine craft. (TES route? Types? Forging?) Same with armor.

Mobs also have damage types. Spider would be piercing, zombie would be bludgeoning, etc.[/quote]</span>

Maybe a scribing table where you use inks made by crafting a water bottle with a dye to scribe runes onto paper; once you have a valid rune you can remove the scroll, using it takes durability off it and you can recharge it using XP by putting it into an enchanting table or something

You could even make them use XP instead of their own durability, so XP is no longer actually XP and is more just your gay elf magic essence buildup
