Here&#39;s my skin. I haven&#39;t been on any servers since I got it though so nobody&#39;s seen it.
It&#39;s supposed to be [URL=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8lls612LQ1qkx426.png&quot;]a character from a cartoon[/URL] which is part of why the colors are kind of plain.

I think I&#39;ll try and improve it a bit; other than adding noise (which I already plan on doing) does anyone have any suggestions?[/QUOTE]

Here&#39;s my skin. I haven&#39;t been on any servers since I got it though so nobody&#39;s seen it.
It&#39;s supposed to be [URL=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8lls612LQ1qkx426.png&quot;]a character from a cartoon[/URL] which is part of why the colors are kind of plain.

I think I&#39;ll try and improve it a bit; other than adding noise (which I already plan on doing) does anyone have any suggestions?[/QUOTE]
 
I knew it looked familiar, the Eighth and a Half President.</span>

I have pickaxe at 1 and sword at 2, with torches at 9 and food at 8. If i&#39;m carrying a shovel or axe (usually to do a surface job where aggressive mobs are minimal, I don&#39;t carry them mining) then I have sword at 4, shovel at 2 and axe at 3. Moving the sword (/axe) along with i&#39;m not carrying all 4 tools.

Also, dmiller, do you think you could create a mod to remove the anvil damaging aspect and level limitations when in creative mode? Or at least the level limitations since you can re-place the anvil easily enough.

[editline]14th October 2012[/editline]

Actually outright removing the damaging aspect of it would be appreciate, or you could change it to get more damaged as it suffers falls, where larger falls damage it quicker. Is that even possible?"

I always have my inventory cordoned off like this. The final three columns always look something like that. Logs [I]always[/I] go in that slot.

                        <postrender input="Wow in retrospect this is way longer than it meant to be, but if you guys have the time I hope you read it.

I always had this wish that dev studios would splinter into ~3-4 different groups, and then each take the game into a separate direction. They would release new updates maybe twice a month (Like old minecraft used to be) and then maybe after 3-6 months they would weigh the community&#39;s opinion on which version is the best, and then all start working on that version, only splintering off in 4 different directions again from the current state of development. That way, the community would have a shit load of different options to try, and would naturally pick out the better one. The devs wouldn&#39;t be tied to a single one either, so if the community liked two designs equally, they might do two groups of two teams. Naturally that&#39;s too hard for a small indie developer to do, but I think Minecraft could pull it off, judging by how many people work at mojang. However it would require everyone to work on it, instead of what it is now, with notch spending the previous half year working on some game that hasn&#39;t been heard of since.

For example:

One group might continue development of minecraft into the Tekkit side. Personally I&#39;m not a fan of it, but I know that a lot of people are. That group could flesh out the massive amount of industrial stuff that can be included in the game.

A second group might work on a more combat oriented version, because lets face it, combat in minecraft is shit. They might implement a system that lets you carry two things at a time, and have certain things be two handed. You could have a longsword, or just duel wield two daggers. You could have a regular sword and a shield. Perhaps you could even put levels into different skill trees, each giving some new talent. You&#39;d have a maximum amount of skill points, but you&#39;d be able to let go of skills to put more levels into another tree. Hell, perhaps this group could even dabble in magic combat, like runes or something of the like. Something that would require a finite item to use, versus the regenerating magica based combat of every other game.

A third group could work on something that I find particularly interesting - Finite water. It could work in the same way that it works in dwarf fortress. All water is finite, but is refilled by rain occurring every once in a while. Water would form small puddles, which would naturally flow downwards into constantly occurring rivers, etc. Water disappears by dissolving into the soil (and perhaps evaporating to some extent, to keep the oceans at a certain level). Soil would only suck up a limited amount of water, so you could still have natural lakes. Stone and other related blocks would not suck up any water, allowing you to make reservoirs to capture rain. Redstone/electricity would not be infinite, instead you&#39;d have to do work to produce it. This could involve setting up a paddle wheel next to a reservoir that could be turned on by a piston letting the water run. Because of finite liquids, you could also have naturally occurring underground reservoirs of oil. Oil would be limited, but you could collect it for a variety of uses from electricity to maybe even engines (without straying too close to the Tekkit path). Naturally, it would also be extremely flamable, which could be made to be used for a bunch of offensive purposes.

A fourth group might do something completely out there and experiment with making minecraft an MMO. Now hear me out here: minecraft has the capability to generate a world 8 times the surface area of Earth, so the map is not an issue. It would have a world that is completely crafted by players, with the exception of the randomly generated structures. Obviously this team would have a shitload of work ahead of them, but I think it might be possible, or at least worth a try. The game would need to have more items, more bosses added to it, etc, but it&#39;s definitely possible. In the beginning, I imagine it as being a complete free for all. The mobs could all be made significantly harder, making a world that&#39;s reminiscent of DayZ. Anything outside of player made communities (castles, etc.) would be extremely dangerous wilderness. Railroads would be a haven for people travelling, because on them you would be safe from the hostile mobs. Perhaps glowstone or something else could even scare off monsters, making lit up paved roads a necessity for traveling to other places safely. Respawning could work in two ways, beds that you&#39;ve slept in, or graveyards if that bed has been destroyed. Graveyards could be naturally generated like villages, and respawning could work WoW style, where you spawn at the nearest graveyard as a ghost and have to run back to your body (waypoint) and then get Resurrection there. As far as player spawning, when you join the world you could choose between spawning at absolute zero (x:0, y:0) or a certain distance from spawn but in a random location, or just in a chunk that has never been loaded before. You could choose to spawn either dead center of civilization, or completely out in the wilderness, dozens of thousands of kilometers from spawn. Obviously some things would need to be worked out like some sort of limited block protection so griefing won&#39;t be ridiculously rampant. Regardless, I think it would be an interesting idea to pursue.


After half a year or so, the devs could all judge the community&#39;s reaction. Those modes that were not executed well would be cut, with teams moving on to the next ones. If several modes are equally well liked, they could continue separately for a while, or if the community insists on having both, they might merge those two modes into one (ie. MMO with the improved fighting mechanics), and carry on from there. I know that from a development perspective this would be a shit ton of work, but it would be so great to see at least one studio attempt it. It has the potential to make the game into so much more. People would be constantly coming back to it, too, as new content would be released all the time. The game in one year could be nothing like what it was a year ago, and it would all be community driven instead of &#39;whatever notch feels like working on at the moment&#39;."

                            <span v-pre>Wow in retrospect this is way longer than it meant to be, but if you guys have the time I hope you read it.

I always had this wish that dev studios would splinter into ~3-4 different groups, and then each take the game into a separate direction. They would release new updates maybe twice a month (Like old minecraft used to be) and then maybe after 3-6 months they would weigh the community&#39;s opinion on which version is the best, and then all start working on that version, only splintering off in 4 different directions again from the current state of development. That way, the community would have a shit load of different options to try, and would naturally pick out the better one. The devs wouldn&#39;t be tied to a single one either, so if the community liked two designs equally, they might do two groups of two teams. Naturally that&#39;s too hard for a small indie developer to do, but I think Minecraft could pull it off, judging by how many people work at mojang. However it would require everyone to work on it, instead of what it is now, with notch spending the previous half year working on some game that hasn&#39;t been heard of since.

For example:

One group might continue development of minecraft into the Tekkit side. Personally I&#39;m not a fan of it, but I know that a lot of people are. That group could flesh out the massive amount of industrial stuff that can be included in the game.

A second group might work on a more combat oriented version, because lets face it, combat in minecraft is shit. They might implement a system that lets you carry two things at a time, and have certain things be two handed. You could have a longsword, or just duel wield two daggers. You could have a regular sword and a shield. Perhaps you could even put levels into different skill trees, each giving some new talent. You&#39;d have a maximum amount of skill points, but you&#39;d be able to let go of skills to put more levels into another tree. Hell, perhaps this group could even dabble in magic combat, like runes or something of the like. Something that would require a finite item to use, versus the regenerating magica based combat of every other game.

A third group could work on something that I find particularly interesting - Finite water. It could work in the same way that it works in dwarf fortress. All water is finite, but is refilled by rain occurring every once in a while. Water would form small puddles, which would naturally flow downwards into constantly occurring rivers, etc. Water disappears by dissolving into the soil (and perhaps evaporating to some extent, to keep the oceans at a certain level). Soil would only suck up a limited amount of water, so you could still have natural lakes. Stone and other related blocks would not suck up any water, allowing you to make reservoirs to capture rain. Redstone/electricity would not be infinite, instead you&#39;d have to do work to produce it. This could involve setting up a paddle wheel next to a reservoir that could be turned on by a piston letting the water run. Because of finite liquids, you could also have naturally occurring underground reservoirs of oil. Oil would be limited, but you could collect it for a variety of uses from electricity to maybe even engines (without straying too close to the Tekkit path). Naturally, it would also be extremely flamable, which could be made to be used for a bunch of offensive purposes.

A fourth group might do something completely out there and experiment with making minecraft an MMO. Now hear me out here: minecraft has the capability to generate a world 8 times the surface area of Earth, so the map is not an issue. It would have a world that is completely crafted by players, with the exception of the randomly generated structures. Obviously this team would have a shitload of work ahead of them, but I think it might be possible, or at least worth a try. The game would need to have more items, more bosses added to it, etc, but it&#39;s definitely possible. In the beginning, I imagine it as being a complete free for all. The mobs could all be made significantly harder, making a world that&#39;s reminiscent of DayZ. Anything outside of player made communities (castles, etc.) would be extremely dangerous wilderness. Railroads would be a haven for people travelling, because on them you would be safe from the hostile mobs. Perhaps glowstone or something else could even scare off monsters, making lit up paved roads a necessity for traveling to other places safely. Respawning could work in two ways, beds that you&#39;ve slept in, or graveyards if that bed has been destroyed. Graveyards could be naturally generated like villages, and respawning could work WoW style, where you spawn at the nearest graveyard as a ghost and have to run back to your body (waypoint) and then get Resurrection there. As far as player spawning, when you join the world you could choose between spawning at absolute zero (x:0, y:0) or a certain distance from spawn but in a random location, or just in a chunk that has never been loaded before. You could choose to spawn either dead center of civilization, or completely out in the wilderness, dozens of thousands of kilometers from spawn. Obviously some things would need to be worked out like some sort of limited block protection so griefing won&#39;t be ridiculously rampant. Regardless, I think it would be an interesting idea to pursue.


After half a year or so, the devs could all judge the community&#39;s reaction. Those modes that were not executed well would be cut, with teams moving on to the next ones. If several modes are equally well liked, they could continue separately for a while, or if the community insists on having both, they might merge those two modes into one (ie. MMO with the improved fighting mechanics), and carry on from there. I know that from a development perspective this would be a shit ton of work, but it would be so great to see at least one studio attempt it. It has the potential to make the game into so much more. People would be constantly coming back to it, too, as new content would be released all the time. The game in one year could be nothing like what it was a year ago, and it would all be community driven instead of &#39;whatever notch feels like working on at the moment&#39;.</span>

Somewhat off my previous post, finite water would make caves so badass. You know how ravines under an ocean just cause a mild column of water to fall to the bottom? Imagine an ocean completely flooding into a ravine. It would spread through a cave system, and using the code that&#39;s already in the game it would behave in the same way that real water does. Meaning it would go downwards into caves but not back up, creating air pockets inside of them. I always figured this would be so cool, because you could be walking through a cave that you entered on land, only to discover that a section of it is flooded with water. This leads you to have to dive down, and continue forward in search of another pocket of air. This would add a whole other level of difficulty to caves. 

I&#39;ve always wanted mojang to add scuba helmets. Like being able to craft a helmet out of glass (like you craft every other helmet). The helmet alone would be useless, but if you could carry air sacs (inksacs + slimeball in crafting square) to increase how much breath you could hold underwater. Each sack would increase your breath by maybe 1/2 of it&#39;s current capacity, but they wouldn&#39;t stack. This means that if you wanted to, you could fill your entire inventory with them and be able to breathe underwater for 2+ minutes, you just wouldn&#39;t have any room for anything else."
