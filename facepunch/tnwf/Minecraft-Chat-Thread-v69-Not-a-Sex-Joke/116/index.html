I had however played classic, so i was not totally lost with the basic mechanics of the game.

I spawned in a mountain range, climbed around a bit until i found the entrance to a cave. (May i remind you i had no idea what monsters were, or what happens at night.)
I was heading down into the cave when i suddenly caught sight of something in the dark. A skinny man stood at the bottom and looked back up on me. A loud TWANG and half a heart later i was running away from the mountains hoping the skinny man was not following me.

I found a beach and a couple of tiny islands situated some 30 blocks out in the water. I thought that was a good place to build a house, so i went out there. After trying to click the dirt blocks away for 5 minutes i eventually understood you had to hold the mousebutton down in order to dig. So i built myself a dirt hut, and before i knew it, night fell.

Still scared from my encounter with the skinny cave man, the night was just as frightening. On the shore i saw strange creatures jumping around in the sand, including what i thought was a red-eyed man crawling on all four.

I stopped playing, and didn&#39;t play again a week later when i had watched some basic tutorials.
Im actually really glad i tried it out without knowing anything about it. I can look back at that time and think, &quot;Man, what a dumbass&quot;.

That was sometime before the Halloween update containing nether and biomes."

I was just playing 1.7.3 today; one of the biggest things I notice when I switch back through versions (aside from the lack of sprinting) is how dodgable skeletons are. It&#39;s like the difference between a kid tossing a ball underhand and an adult hurling it.

This reminds me though, I was on one of the servers I frequent a while ago and someone came on who hadn&#39;t played Minecraft since &quot;before the piston update&quot;, they said. The first things he asked was if the beds were fixed, if day and night were enabled, and if flying was enabled. :v:"

As part of my nostalgia trip, I delved into a dark and murky cave from the primitive era of 1.7.3 to locate the spot where I found my first diamonds in Minecraft.
Although it isn&#39;t many, I treasured them dearly and made my first Diamond Pickaxe from them. While that pick undoubtedly snapped unceremoniously in some stranded cave, I still remember it to this day.

the idea that someone would call 1.7.3 &quot;primitive&quot; just fucking boggles my mind, I know it was a long time ago but it still seems like just a few updates ago, I can&#39;t imagine that 1.7.3 was someone else&#39;s starting point"

It&#39;s been over a year since 1.7.3. In fact, hasn&#39;t it been a year since Minecraft&#39;s &quot;official&quot; release?

1.7.3 is what I think of when I think &quot;old minecraft&quot;, despite the fact that I began playing back in 1.4 or 1.5 (god, that feels like a long time ago to me) back when minecart boosters still worked. I remember seeing occasional Facepunch threads for the game even earlier than that, and I remember having a look at the OP for one thread and thinking &quot;what the fuck is this&quot;."
