Pneumatic tubes (redpower ones) are smart about moving items. Unlike BC pipes, which dump items into the pipes and let the items take random routes through the pipe, pneumatic tubes will send items through into the nearest inventory that can accept items.

An example would be putting items into several furnaces. With BC, pumping a bunch of different ores into the furnaces would make some land in the furnaces, and drop the rest onto the ground since it won&#39;t fit. With RP, if the item won&#39;t fit into the nearest inventory, the tube sends the item along to the next available inventory instead of dropping it on the ground."

That does sound really good actually.
In BC you have obsidian pipes which collect any objects that fall on them, and you pump stuff using a wooden pipe + an engine. Is there an equivalent of the obsidian pipe in redpower, and how do you power the movement of items?"

Transposers are a lot like obsidian pipes. They&#39;ll automatically collect and spit items that fall on top of the face into pneumatic tubes, and if you give it a redstone signal it&#39;ll either pull an item out of a chest or collect every item on the ground in a 3x3 area on the face.

You can also use Filters to pull full stacks or only certain items out of chests. Just need to give it a looping redstone signal, which RP&#39;s timer logic gate does well."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Jallen;38590588]That does sound really good actually.
In BC you have obsidian pipes which collect any objects that fall on them, and you pump stuff using a wooden pipe + an engine. Is there an equivalent of the obsidian pipe in redpower, and how do you power the movement of items?[/QUOTE]
 
Transposers are a lot like obsidian pipes. They&#39;ll automatically collect and spit items that fall on top of the face into pneumatic tubes, and if you give it a redstone signal it&#39;ll either pull an item out of a chest or collect every item on the ground in a 3x3 area on the face.

You can also use Filters to pull full stacks or only certain items out of chests. Just need to give it a looping redstone signal, which RP&#39;s timer logic gate does well.</span>

That&#39;s not very realistic, though. Re-writing the game would pretty much break all mods, and it would take a very long time."

I agree to an extent, however there are still definitely bad habits which should be avoided. Refusing to acknowledge that your code is (potentially) inefficient or has lots of bad habits is stupid and makes you unable to improve upon the language."

Isn&#39;t that exactly what he&#39;s saying though? He&#39;s judging the code because of the very clear lack of optimisation in Minecraft.

The computing hobbyist is what has made computing what it is today. You don&#39;t get amazing at coding by doing courses, you get amazing through practice.
Notch&#39;s code may not be the best, but any of its flaws are not to do with being self taught.

In addition, I wish people would stop complaining about his code. How many people who complain about it have even looked at it? They see a few problems on the surface and some other guys saying &quot;notch is a terrible coder&quot; and they jump on the idiot bandwagon.
At the end of the day, he has made what is overall a stable and reasonably performing game of significant complexity and sold millions of copies.[/QUOTE]
 
I have looked at the code before and there are probably a few things that could be changed to better optimize. Being self taught though can bring on bad habits in coding, you do not have a teacher or someone telling you the better way to do something. Notch could have coded something one way, and yes it works, but maybe there is another way that would make the code run faster and be better optimized. I do not think he is a terrible coder, I think that he just has done things in a way other people would look at and think is not the best way to do it.

A complete re-write of the code would break a lot of mods. But they can always give them the code and let them work with it to get there mods up to date. It would take some time yea, but I think the game would be in a better state if that happened."
