Honestly I don&#39;t think any kind of morality system in Minecraft would fit well or work particularly well as an actual gameplay mechanic and not a gimmick. I&#39;d much rather see a magic mod work on something tangible such as Thaumcraft 3&#39;s Aura system or something like that, rather than some notion of right or wrong affecting your capabilities. Minecraft just isn&#39;t the right place to bring that can of worms, in my opinion.

I mean, I wouldn&#39;t use a magic mod like that since I don&#39;t see it as necessary anyway - I quite like the physicality of Minecraft, the focus on materials and objects rather than abstract concepts like morality or magic or the human psyche makes it inherently a simple, soothing game to play. It doesn&#39;t try to characterize anything or provide reasons in the game to do things, and adding a system that does seems like it would be incredibly out of place.[/QUOTE]
 
I think Minecraft lacks the depth to have any sort of morality. Outside of the villagers, all Minecraft is happens to be a giant, neutral world that has no affect on anything. The earth doesn&#39;t care if you&#39;re good or bad to it."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Weiss;38288392][b]Pretend I quoted dmiller here or something related to his magic thing that&#39;s what this is about okay[/b]

Honestly I don&#39;t think any kind of morality system in Minecraft would fit well or work particularly well as an actual gameplay mechanic and not a gimmick. I&#39;d much rather see a magic mod work on something tangible such as Thaumcraft 3&#39;s Aura system or something like that, rather than some notion of right or wrong affecting your capabilities. Minecraft just isn&#39;t the right place to bring that can of worms, in my opinion.

I mean, I wouldn&#39;t use a magic mod like that since I don&#39;t see it as necessary anyway - I quite like the physicality of Minecraft, the focus on materials and objects rather than abstract concepts like morality or magic or the human psyche makes it inherently a simple, soothing game to play. It doesn&#39;t try to characterize anything or provide reasons in the game to do things, and adding a system that does seems like it would be incredibly out of place.[/QUOTE]
 
I think Minecraft lacks the depth to have any sort of morality. Outside of the villagers, all Minecraft is happens to be a giant, neutral world that has no affect on anything. The earth doesn&#39;t care if you&#39;re good or bad to it.</span>

It would fill up an inventory slot like normal, and have no special use ordinarily, but all mobs would &quot;bleed&quot; when hit. Blood droplets would act like Exp, but fade really quickly (likely within 2 seconds of generation). While they cannot be obtained on their own, when you pull out the Kapala, they get eaten up like Items, and the Kapalas sprite gets slowly filled with more blood. It should take a decent amount of work to fill up, so possibly 40 blood droplets? When it becomes full, you could apply the Enchantment overlay to show that it&#39;s ready. When you drink from a non-full Kapala, it gives you Half a Heart 1-10 blood droplets, 2 hearts 10-20, 4 20-39. When full, it fully heals you, and you are &quot;Blessed&quot;. Being Blessed means that you take no more then Half a Heart of Damage each &quot;hit&quot; for 30 seconds, and you gain a heart of health every 10 during that time period. Though, the Kapala comes with a Curse; if you do not feed it blood within 5 minutes, you take a heart damage. After 10 minutes after that you start dying at the rate you would if you were Starving, and your HP regen is disabled. Even if the cup is full, you can satiate it&#39;s hunger with blood with no drawbacks. The curse will not activate when the Cup is full, but will skip to Killing you if removed from your inventory at any time when not full (and when it&#39;s out of your inventory, regardless of fullness, the curse would activate after the alotted time). If the Kapala gets destroyed somehow, you are &quot;Punished&quot;, which gives you a Permanent Slowness and Disabled HP Regen until you fill up a second Kapala. Mobs would drop varied amounts of blood when killed, with all friendly mobs only dropping 0-2 droplets, and Hostiles (aside from Skellies and Zombies) would drop 1-4. 

[B]TL;DR: A cursed cup that rewards you for filling it up with the blood of your foes, but binds you to it, making you a slave to it&#39;s hunger.[/B]

                        <postrender input="Here&#39;s an idea to revamp enchanting and give gold a use:
Gold is the magical material, it is used as a base for alchemy and enchanting (Only gold tools can be enchanted)
Gold nuggets are used in place of netherwart, netherwarts either explode in your face or give you a random potion effect
Gold tools on their own have the speed of diamond and the life of wood. Enchanting them gives specific effects (You can&#39;t mix the enchants)
Efficiency gives the durability of iron (roughly) and increases the mining speed (From diamond and beyond)
Unbreaking decreases the speed to abound iron (roughly) but increases the amount of uses it has from diamond and above
Fortune has the number of uses as wood and increases the amount of blocks an item drops
Silk touch has the number of uses as stone and makes the item drop it&#39;s actual block (if available)

Similar effects for gold armor and gold weapons.

It may end up being weird and awkward, but if a modder could add something similar to that to see it&#39;s affects pm gameplay and whether or not it plays well I would appreciate it."

                            <span v-pre>Here&#39;s an idea to revamp enchanting and give gold a use:
Gold is the magical material, it is used as a base for alchemy and enchanting (Only gold tools can be enchanted)
Gold nuggets are used in place of netherwart, netherwarts either explode in your face or give you a random potion effect
Gold tools on their own have the speed of diamond and the life of wood. Enchanting them gives specific effects (You can&#39;t mix the enchants)
Efficiency gives the durability of iron (roughly) and increases the mining speed (From diamond and beyond)
Unbreaking decreases the speed to abound iron (roughly) but increases the amount of uses it has from diamond and above
Fortune has the number of uses as wood and increases the amount of blocks an item drops
Silk touch has the number of uses as stone and makes the item drop it&#39;s actual block (if available)

Similar effects for gold armor and gold weapons.

It may end up being weird and awkward, but if a modder could add something similar to that to see it&#39;s affects pm gameplay and whether or not it plays well I would appreciate it.</span>

Like iron, iron swords, iron shovels, and iron helmets, potatos and carrots are rare drops. Which is to say they drop under the same conditions that XP drops.

So killing them with a fall or a lava blade will not get you potatos or carrots."

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=NateDude;38291898]I pose an idea to mod Creators:Make a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapala]Kapala[/url] item. It would fill up an inventory slot like normal, and have no special use ordinarily, but all mobs would &quot;bleed&quot; when hit. Blood droplets would act like Exp, but fade really quickly (likely within 2 seconds of generation). While they cannot be obtained on their own, when you pull out the Kapala, they get eaten up like Items, and the Kapalas sprite gets slowly filled with more blood. It should take a decent amount of work to fill up, so possibly 40 blood droplets? When it becomes full, you could apply the Enchantment overlay to show that it&#39;s ready. When you drink from a non-full Kapala, it gives you Half a Heart 1-10 blood droplets, 2 hearts 10-20, 4 20-39. When full, it fully heals you, and you are &quot;Blessed&quot;. Being Blessed means that you take no more then Half a Heart of Damage each &quot;hit&quot; for 30 seconds, and you gain a heart of health every 10 during that time period. Though, the Kapala comes with a Curse; if you do not feed it blood within 5 minutes, you take a heart damage. After 10 minutes after that you start dying at the rate you would if you were Starving, and your HP regen is disabled. Even if the cup is full, you can satiate it&#39;s hunger with blood with no drawbacks. The curse will not activate when the Cup is full, but will skip to Killing you if removed from your inventory at any time when not full (and when it&#39;s out of your inventory, regardless of fullness, the curse would activate after the alotted time). If the Kapala gets destroyed somehow, you are &quot;Punished&quot;, which gives you a Permanent Slowness and Disabled HP Regen until you fill up a second Kapala. Mobs would drop varied amounts of blood when killed, with all friendly mobs only dropping 0-2 droplets, and Hostiles (aside from Skellies and Zombies) would drop 1-4. [B]TL;DR: A cursed cup that rewards you for filling it up with the blood of your foes, but binds you to it, making you a slave to it&#39;s hunger.[/B][U]Anyone have any thoughts or crit.?[/U][/QUOTE] I... I might just have to do this.Damn you, why&#39;d you have to distract me with a fun idea!?

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=NateDude;38291898]I pose an idea to mod Creators:Make a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapala]Kapala[/url] item. It would fill up an inventory slot like normal, and have no special use ordinarily, but all mobs would &quot;bleed&quot; when hit. Blood droplets would act like Exp, but fade really quickly (likely within 2 seconds of generation). While they cannot be obtained on their own, when you pull out the Kapala, they get eaten up like Items, and the Kapalas sprite gets slowly filled with more blood. It should take a decent amount of work to fill up, so possibly 40 blood droplets? When it becomes full, you could apply the Enchantment overlay to show that it&#39;s ready. When you drink from a non-full Kapala, it gives you Half a Heart 1-10 blood droplets, 2 hearts 10-20, 4 20-39. When full, it fully heals you, and you are &quot;Blessed&quot;. Being Blessed means that you take no more then Half a Heart of Damage each &quot;hit&quot; for 30 seconds, and you gain a heart of health every 10 during that time period. Though, the Kapala comes with a Curse; if you do not feed it blood within 5 minutes, you take a heart damage. After 10 minutes after that you start dying at the rate you would if you were Starving, and your HP regen is disabled. Even if the cup is full, you can satiate it&#39;s hunger with blood with no drawbacks. The curse will not activate when the Cup is full, but will skip to Killing you if removed from your inventory at any time when not full (and when it&#39;s out of your inventory, regardless of fullness, the curse would activate after the alotted time). If the Kapala gets destroyed somehow, you are &quot;Punished&quot;, which gives you a Permanent Slowness and Disabled HP Regen until you fill up a second Kapala. Mobs would drop varied amounts of blood when killed, with all friendly mobs only dropping 0-2 droplets, and Hostiles (aside from Skellies and Zombies) would drop 1-4. [B]TL;DR: A cursed cup that rewards you for filling it up with the blood of your foes, but binds you to it, making you a slave to it&#39;s hunger.[/B][U]Anyone have any thoughts or crit.?[/U][/QUOTE] I... I might just have to do this.Damn you, why&#39;d you have to distract me with a fun idea!?

Well, you don&#39;t have to do it right now, or even at all, &#39;s just a fun Idea I had. Maybe it could tie into your mod somehow? Like, instead of just some stats on Good/Bad(Defensive/Offensive) you&#39;d get other bonuses aswell, like new crafting recipes, or maybe this would be an &quot;earn-able&quot; item, obtained in some fashion other then crafting? Either way, you can do whatever you want man. While I&#39;m [I]beaming[/I] at the thought of you making it a mod, you&#39;re not obligated to in any way~

Also, here&#39;s the sprite from the Original (Non-XBLA and free to play btw) Spelunky, more befitting of minecraft to use as a base (though I could try my hand at whipping up some self-made kapala sprites if this becomes serious).

                        <postrender input="Concerning the &quot;Kapala&quot; item, the thought of using blood for something is interesting, but here&#39;s how I&#39;d go about it.

Killing an enemy would make them drop the Blood orbs similar to XP, and would vanish after a few seconds unless absorbed by holding out the Skull Chalice. However, this ties in to both a system of magic and a system that implements Gold into Enchanting.

Firstly, Gold can be combined with another Item on an Anvil to create Runes; the other Item is not consumed, as it is used as a &quot;template&quot; for the type of Rune crafted. One by one, the Runes can be hammered into Weapons, Armour and other specific items, which allows for precise Enchantments and, more importantly, the crafting of Focuses.

Depending on the type of item that the Glyphs are hammered into, as well as the Glyphs themselves and the order in which they were hammered into the item, you can unlock the power of said Item at an Enchanting Table, using some of your accumulated Souls/XP to turn the Glyph-adorned item into a Focus. An example of this is enchanting a Skull with the Runes &quot;Decay&quot; (from Rotten Flesh) and &quot;Venom&quot; (from Spider Eye); the end-result is [B]Blood Focus [Nekrachni&#39;s Kiss][/B]; a Blood Focus that launches a glob of potent Poison at one&#39;s enemies.

Below is a list of a few Focus types; each one can be recharged in a different way, and each type appeals to a different order of Great Spirits. Keep in mind that the different orders have their own agendas, different things that they favour and deride, so avoid using spells in a fashion that goes against the creed of its associated Great Spirits. Scorning them will weaken your ability to use the powers associated with them, whilst staying on their good side will make you even more powerful in their name.

[quote][B]Blood Focus/Skull Chalice:[/B] Crafted from the Skull of a reviled foe, the Blood Focus draws upon Blood to power its spell; Blood will flow freely from most creatures living or dead (with a few exceptions), but will lose its power shortly after being liberated from its owner, so hold the Focus out in front of you to draw in the Blood while it&#39;s still fresh. Blood Magic is strongly tied to Life and Death, preserving and restoring with one hand, whilst destroying and reforming with the other. Being that it can easily replenish its power if the wielder is on the ball, Blood Focuses have the lowest number of Charges in comparison to other types of Focus, though they work best against Blood-bearing enemies, since Bloodless creatures are usually unaffected by the Lifebound effects of blood magic. Regardless, though the Blood Spirits revel in the spilling of blood, shed only the blood of those who would do you harm; there is no honour in shedding innocent blood, and you may fall out of their favour if you choose to turn your blade against one who does not deserve it. However, they don&#39;t exactly like the undead, and relish in their destruction, so absorbing the Blood of the undead will endear yourself with the Blood Spirits.

[B]Astral Focus/Cosmic Rod:[/B] Forged from mighty Thunderbolt crystal, found often during Thunderstorms, the Astral Focus gains its power from the sky. Light and Lightning are the powers tied to Astral Magic, illuminating the darkness and unleashing powerful discharges; respectfully presided over by Celestial Maiden Sola and Cloud Consort Raiden. Leaving a Sky Focus out in the open, preferably upon a Sky Altar to please the Celestial Maiden, will have it bathe in the light of the Sun, Moon and stars; it will charge gradually, but in the end it is worth it, for Sky Focuses have the most charges of any Focus. However, should fortune smile, Thunderstorms are cause for jubilation, for when the Cloud Consort rides across the dense road of thunderclouds, His chariot sends down pillars of lightning, and if you honour the Celestial Maiden (his wife), fate will dictate that lightning will strike the Altar at least once during the thunderstorm, adding a massive amount of charge to the Cosmic Rod placed upon it. The Maiden and Consort also favour the destruction of fire and stone, and will not look kindly upon you if you embrace the power of the Inner Flame.

[B]Deep Focus/Chthonic Lantern:[/B] A twisted contraption of Clay, Torch and Pumpkin, the Deep Focus channels the power of the Inner Flame, the deeper light that was born when the Celestial Maiden teased the Spirits of the Earth one too many times; a decision that she still regrets, a decision testified by her charred thighs, now soothed and shrouded by curtains of mist sewn by the Cloud Consort. Deep Magic deals with Fire and Earth, smashing all in its path and burning what remains. The Chthonic Lantern has a moderate amount of charges, and is charged quite easily by simply heating it in a furnace; not as easy to charge on the fly as a Skull Chalice, but it&#39;s still quicker than waiting for the Celestial Harlot to work her magic. The Spirits of the Earth don&#39;t appreciate those who consort with the Celestial Powers, as you can tell, and yet they embrace those who turn from the Sun and Storm.

[B]Soul Focus/Wizard&#39;s Tome:[/B] An icon of the Ascended Archmagi, the Soul Focus is a Wizard&#39;s Tome, with the power of the spell etched into the pages of the book. Soul Magic deals with summons, using incantations to call upon otherworldly entities to do your bidding. These Tomes hold a mild number of charges, but the way they are charged is somewhat simplistic; place the Tome upon an Enchanting Table and use your Souls to recharge it. It seems simple enough, but the Archmagi actually favour you using your Souls in this way, for when you recharge your Tome, some of the Souls used are transferred to them as a sort of &quot;Arcane Power Tax&quot;; they don&#39;t approve of the newfangled power of &quot;enchantment&quot; though, save for when you make more Tomes, and they don&#39;t like it when you use your Souls to empower Weapons and Armour, probably because it is something they can&#39;t tax because they didn&#39;t patent it.[/quote]

Bit of mythology woven in there for extra flavour, but those&#39;re a few primal examples of spell items and the spirits associated with them; one is for the warrior who bathes in blood, dealing with life and death, yet teaches them to be wise with their blade; one for the patient follower who waits for the sky&#39;s heavenly bounty, and resists the temptations of the Inner Flame; one for they who deal with the depths and shun the skies; and one for those who favour paying for others to do their dirty work in favour of focusing their power inwards to deal with things personally. All I have for now, though a fifth &quot;order of power&quot;, maybe linked to Water and Flora, could complete the five-fold circle of Blood, Sky, Depths, Soul and Nature."

Gold is the magical material, it is used as a base for alchemy and enchanting (Only gold tools can be enchanted)

Gold tools on their own have the speed of diamond and the life of wood. Enchanting them gives specific effects (You can&#39;t mix the enchants)
Efficiency gives the durability of iron (roughly) and increases the mining speed (From diamond and beyond)
Unbreaking decreases the speed to abound iron (roughly) but increases the amount of uses it has from diamond and above
Fortune has the number of uses as wood and increases the amount of blocks an item drops
Silk touch has the number of uses as stone and makes the item drop it&#39;s actual block (if available)

Similar effects for gold armor and gold weapons.

It may end up being weird and awkward, but if a modder could add something similar to that to see it&#39;s affects pm gameplay and whether or not it plays well I would appreciate it.[/QUOTE]
