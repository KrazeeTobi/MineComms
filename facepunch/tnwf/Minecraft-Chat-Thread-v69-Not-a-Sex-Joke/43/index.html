                        <postrender input="Is there any way to generate a completely new map in an old version of Minecraft for a server?
I have a particular map seed that was quite amazing and was used for ages, through thick and thin, through game-breaking updates, until the server finally succumbed and returned to dust.

Now that I can host my own server, I want to generate the same map and load it into my server. I&#39;ve been trying to accomplish it using WorldPainter, but I&#39;m pretty shitty with it. I could use MCNostalgia to restore my game to Beta 1.5_01, but then I would have to wander around until the world generated enough land for the server, which would take ages.

Ideally, I would like to generate a circular area of land 2048 by 2048 blocks, and past that, the land drops off into the void. Using WorldPainter, I could then touch up the land closer to the origin to create a feeling of thousands of years passing, then add it to the server and convert the world to 1.4.2.

Any help with this dream of mine?"

                            <span v-pre>Is there any way to generate a completely new map in an old version of Minecraft for a server?
I have a particular map seed that was quite amazing and was used for ages, through thick and thin, through game-breaking updates, until the server finally succumbed and returned to dust.

Now that I can host my own server, I want to generate the same map and load it into my server. I&#39;ve been trying to accomplish it using WorldPainter, but I&#39;m pretty shitty with it. I could use MCNostalgia to restore my game to Beta 1.5_01, but then I would have to wander around until the world generated enough land for the server, which would take ages.

Ideally, I would like to generate a circular area of land 2048 by 2048 blocks, and past that, the land drops off into the void. Using WorldPainter, I could then touch up the land closer to the origin to create a feeling of thousands of years passing, then add it to the server and convert the world to 1.4.2.

Any help with this dream of mine?</span>

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Cheshire_cat;38204446]Is there any way to generate a completely new map in an old version of Minecraft for a server?
I have a particular map seed that was quite amazing and was used for ages, through thick and thin, through game-breaking updates, until the server finally succumbed and returned to dust.

Now that I can host my own server, I want to generate the same map and load it into my server. I&#39;ve been trying to accomplish it using WorldPainter, but I&#39;m pretty shitty with it. I could use MCNostalgia to restore my game to Beta 1.5_01, but then I would have to wander around until the world generated enough land for the server, which would take ages.

Ideally, I would like to generate a circular area of land 2048 by 2048 blocks, and past that, the land drops off into the void. Using WorldPainter, I could then touch up the land closer to the origin to create a feeling of thousands of years passing, then add it to the server and convert the world to 1.4.2.

Any help with this dream of mine?[/QUOTE]
 
I can give you the 1.5 beta server .exe if you need it.</span>

Eh, pistons are alright, but I loved the mechanic of the old pistons much better.

I like the now pistons better than the old pistons. Being able to break blocks and jump high with pistons has some negative implications. 

 I enjoy playing old versions of the game because it&#39;s a lot harder and scarier. Current minecraft is extremely easy and (kind of) dumbed down.

Should this be the case, there should be a Compost item that works like Bone Meal without the dying properties. As a Hardcore player, I accept that challenge.

As well as a water meter, but the only one I could find wouldn&#39;t treat water like food by adding all this complex filtration stuff. Maybe if that&#39;s added, the Canteen (Leather surrounding a Glass Bottle) could hold three sips (possibly with potion from a cauldron)."

Food is a lot easier to grow (Even with hunger in the game there&#39;s more food than you&#39;d ever need, not to mention bone meal), iron/diamond is a fuck ton more common and iron armor is not hard at all to get (and armor doesn&#39;t degrade like it used to so you don&#39;t have to replace it as often), you can get to level 30 and get the highest enchants possible without doing anything remotely dangerous, there&#39;s a whole lot of things that make the game easier.

Also, bows are better than they used to be. You have to charge your bow, but when you did rapid fire bow most of the arrows bounced off and did piss damage. They do a fuck ton more damage now and they don&#39;t bounce off.

You also don&#39;t realize how much sprinting changes how you deal with stuff. You can outrun everything, and as long as you keep running you can avoid most damage at night. When you couldn&#39;t sprint monsters were a lot more menacing."

Food becoming compost would be cool.  Not sure how I&#39;d feel about a water meter though, seems like it would just be a second food meter.
Maybe a temperature meter?  More activities create more heat, different biomes will make you hotter or colder at different rates.  If your body temperature goes to either extreme you&#39;ll start taking damage.  Drinking from water skins or jumping in water can be used to cool down, and standing near fire/lava can be used to warm up.

Then again adding something like this would cause a huge uproar just like the food meter did."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Stonecycle;38212557]Should this be the case, there should be a Compost item that works like Bone Meal without the dying properties. As a Hardcore player, I accept that challenge.

As well as a water meter, but the only one I could find wouldn&#39;t treat water like food by adding all this complex filtration stuff. Maybe if that&#39;s added, the Canteen (Leather surrounding a Glass Bottle) could hold three sips (possibly with potion from a cauldron).[/QUOTE]
 
Food becoming compost would be cool.  Not sure how I&#39;d feel about a water meter though, seems like it would just be a second food meter.
Maybe a temperature meter?  More activities create more heat, different biomes will make you hotter or colder at different rates.  If your body temperature goes to either extreme you&#39;ll start taking damage.  Drinking from water skins or jumping in water can be used to cool down, and standing near fire/lava can be used to warm up.

Then again adding something like this would cause a huge uproar just like the food meter did.</span>

Rather: It&#39;s time less new things were added and more old things were polished and balanced

The new lighting system &amp; that one fix that treats the back of stairs as solid for bars/panes/fences, because things looking more consistent is great
Slabs and stairs on a generic system so adding new ones isn&#39;t a pain (might already be done? I just remember wooden slabs being set to the stone material for literally multiple months after they were added - it would be nice to just make a stair/slab block parented to a generic block, and have that new block inherit the particulars of the generic parent)
New mob behaviours (I like the new gearing thing mobs get but for that to really come into play you have to die to them in the first place - so the difficulty ramp is reversed)
On that point: Spiders rotating to the surface they&#39;re climbing. I seriously cannot tell when they&#39;re actually climbing up things or just jumping, it&#39;s confusing and looks terrible. Zombies actually attacking instead of mobs just being walking spikepits would also be nice.



As a new thing I could see enhancing the game dramatically: damage types. Not like a huge thing, but a Slashing/Crushing/Piercing trio with resistances to match, with materials having an affinity for one damage type (does more of this damage when made into tools, and resists more of this damage when made into armor) + Maces and Spears for crush/pierce damage
Then if mobs actually have different resistances (and different damage types) the kind of gear you carry will make a difference to how effective you are against different types of mobs, and no longer is there necessarily an &quot;objectively best&quot; weapon/armor for all situations
This also opens the door for more mob variety without them simply being redundant - mobs could share [i]behaviours[/i] without being literally the same mob, so while a different zombie might behave the same it could be more threatening than its compatriots because you may not have a weapon that&#39;s particularly effective against it

You could also extend the damage variety thing to regular tool effectiveness; so a pickaxe being primarily a piercing object would be better if made from something with an affinity for piercing damage, and an axe being primarily a slashing object would be better if made from something that&#39;s better for slashing damage
You could even add an incentive to use tools as weapons by making them deal multiple damagetypes but not as well as a proper weapon, like axes would deal slashing and crushing damage in equal measure and be better than things that don&#39;t use those types, but wouldn&#39;t be as good at either one as a sword or mace.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Rammlied;38213233]I don&#39;t think they have to add more stuff to make the game harder, they need to change the things in the game now to make them harder/less common/harder to abtain/more expensive/etc.[/QUOTE]
 
Rather: It&#39;s time less new things were added and more old things were polished and balanced

The new lighting system &amp; that one fix that treats the back of stairs as solid for bars/panes/fences, because things looking more consistent is great
Slabs and stairs on a generic system so adding new ones isn&#39;t a pain (might already be done? I just remember wooden slabs being set to the stone material for literally multiple months after they were added - it would be nice to just make a stair/slab block parented to a generic block, and have that new block inherit the particulars of the generic parent)
New mob behaviours (I like the new gearing thing mobs get but for that to really come into play you have to die to them in the first place - so the difficulty ramp is reversed)
On that point: Spiders rotating to the surface they&#39;re climbing. I seriously cannot tell when they&#39;re actually climbing up things or just jumping, it&#39;s confusing and looks terrible. Zombies actually attacking instead of mobs just being walking spikepits would also be nice.



As a new thing I could see enhancing the game dramatically: damage types. Not like a huge thing, but a Slashing/Crushing/Piercing trio with resistances to match, with materials having an affinity for one damage type (does more of this damage when made into tools, and resists more of this damage when made into armor) + Maces and Spears for crush/pierce damage
Then if mobs actually have different resistances (and different damage types) the kind of gear you carry will make a difference to how effective you are against different types of mobs, and no longer is there necessarily an &quot;objectively best&quot; weapon/armor for all situations
This also opens the door for more mob variety without them simply being redundant - mobs could share [i]behaviours[/i] without being literally the same mob, so while a different zombie might behave the same it could be more threatening than its compatriots because you may not have a weapon that&#39;s particularly effective against it

You could also extend the damage variety thing to regular tool effectiveness; so a pickaxe being primarily a piercing object would be better if made from something with an affinity for piercing damage, and an axe being primarily a slashing object would be better if made from something that&#39;s better for slashing damage
You could even add an incentive to use tools as weapons by making them deal multiple damagetypes but not as well as a proper weapon, like axes would deal slashing and crushing damage in equal measure and be better than things that don&#39;t use those types, but wouldn&#39;t be as good at either one as a sword or mace.
