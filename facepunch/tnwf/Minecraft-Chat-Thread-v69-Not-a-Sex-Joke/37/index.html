I don&#39;t know what happened to the mob spawning rules, but a long time ago I remember getting so frustrated that cows and pigs would spawn so thickly that I couldn&#39;t even hear myself think, especially at night. I ended up burning the house down and moving because there were so many animals spawning it was driving me crazy."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=slashsnemesis;38132338]I think the only thing that absolutely needs to be reworked is the neutral mob spawning rules. In my world right now I have enough diamonds and obsidian to make an enchanting table. The only thing I need is a book. But I need leather to make a book. I&#39;ve walked upwards of 500 blocks in multiple directions and have found maybe 5 cows. None of which dropped leather. I have diamond tools and armor and I&#39;m being held back by a freaking cow.

Also I don&#39;t understand why double tapping W is sprint and sneaking is shift, that&#39;s literally the opposite of 99% of every other game that I play. With shift being sprint and tapping W is if you want to make slow, precise movements.[/QUOTE]
 
I don&#39;t know what happened to the mob spawning rules, but a long time ago I remember getting so frustrated that cows and pigs would spawn so thickly that I couldn&#39;t even hear myself think, especially at night. I ended up burning the house down and moving because there were so many animals spawning it was driving me crazy.</span>

I think they made it so that neutral mobs would only spawn with a certain chance in newly generated chunks and made it quite rare for them to respawn in existing chunks.

But then again you never really see zombie hordes, at most I see 3 at a time. They should make zombies tend to stick together, wandering around aimlessly, slowly growing in numbers."

                        <postrender input="You know what would be awesome? a &quot;map binder&quot; or &quot;map book&quot; that you can craft. This would allow you to place any map you&#39;ve already made into a crafting table with the map book/binder and the map would fuse with the binder, and then from now on whenever you&#39;re in the area of the map(s) you fused to the binder your player will automatically switch through the pages and get to the map part you&#39;re on.

So if you make this map binder and then you add tons and tons of maps you&#39;ve made previously into the binder then you would have more or less an actual practical means of knowing where you are, past the edges of the map instead of having to carry 30 unstackable maps you&#39;re going to have to scroll through to find the right one.

Is that possible to make? and if it is is it hard?

I think the animation the enchantment table has would be pretty nifty for it."

                            <span v-pre>You know what would be awesome? a &quot;map binder&quot; or &quot;map book&quot; that you can craft. This would allow you to place any map you&#39;ve already made into a crafting table with the map book/binder and the map would fuse with the binder, and then from now on whenever you&#39;re in the area of the map(s) you fused to the binder your player will automatically switch through the pages and get to the map part you&#39;re on.

So if you make this map binder and then you add tons and tons of maps you&#39;ve made previously into the binder then you would have more or less an actual practical means of knowing where you are, past the edges of the map instead of having to carry 30 unstackable maps you&#39;re going to have to scroll through to find the right one.

Is that possible to make? and if it is is it hard?

I think the animation the enchantment table has would be pretty nifty for it.</span>

Depends, if the server owner has to install something, then its really annoying.
But mods that only require client side installation, are pretty cool, for example the Cape mod, i like mods like that."

[quote] Darwin: From Stone To Steel (SMP mod)

The mod is called &quot;Darwin&quot;, and its main objective is to lead players through the technological history of mankind, while emphasizing and highlighting the benefits of teamwork and cultural development amongst the players, giving rise to communities.

The idea behind the mod is to encourage people to form communities, and to rely on other players to contribute their preferred skills (hunting/mining/smithing/engineering/etc) to the community for a mutually beneficial and satisfying real-world multiplayer experience.

Players will have a somewhat limited set of skills that they can perform, which are subject to the resources (and consequently; the technologies) available to them. With limited skill sets, players will need to rely on one another to perform tasks and to advance technologies within their community.

Communities are likely to develop and employ technologies based on the resources available to them, and therefore, communities will flourish in and around areas where particular resources appear. Some communities will form trade relations with other communities that spring-up near different resources.

The plethora of resources that appear in our mod, generate far more scarcely than typical ores in Vanilla, but they do appear which much greater diversity, and in much, much, much larger deposits… just like real-world geology. This mechanism is part of the magic that makes it difficult for communities to harvest &quot;everything&quot; around them, thus preventing technological leaps and bounds. Combined with the limiting skill set system, which prevents players from becoming a collection of &quot;Individual Supermen&quot;, the mod is all about community, and teamwork. Basic politics will assuredly arise, and simple governments may form, struggles for power, or wars over resources may even occur. History will write itself.

Skills can be learned, and taught, or even discovered… using a simple educational mechanic we&#39;ve devised. It&#39;s an elegant solution that will surely give rise to Masters and Apprentices, as players learn their craft. The quality and quantity of the products and commodities created and traded are reflective of the skills and skill levels of the craftsmen and the members of the community.

[quote] Darwin: From Stone To Steel (SMP mod)

The mod is called &quot;Darwin&quot;, and its main objective is to lead players through the technological history of mankind, while emphasizing and highlighting the benefits of teamwork and cultural development amongst the players, giving rise to communities.

The idea behind the mod is to encourage people to form communities, and to rely on other players to contribute their preferred skills (hunting/mining/smithing/engineering/etc) to the community for a mutually beneficial and satisfying real-world multiplayer experience.

Players will have a somewhat limited set of skills that they can perform, which are subject to the resources (and consequently; the technologies) available to them. With limited skill sets, players will need to rely on one another to perform tasks and to advance technologies within their community.

Communities are likely to develop and employ technologies based on the resources available to them, and therefore, communities will flourish in and around areas where particular resources appear. Some communities will form trade relations with other communities that spring-up near different resources.

The plethora of resources that appear in our mod, generate far more scarcely than typical ores in Vanilla, but they do appear which much greater diversity, and in much, much, much larger deposits… just like real-world geology. This mechanism is part of the magic that makes it difficult for communities to harvest &quot;everything&quot; around them, thus preventing technological leaps and bounds. Combined with the limiting skill set system, which prevents players from becoming a collection of &quot;Individual Supermen&quot;, the mod is all about community, and teamwork. Basic politics will assuredly arise, and simple governments may form, struggles for power, or wars over resources may even occur. History will write itself.

Skills can be learned, and taught, or even discovered… using a simple educational mechanic we&#39;ve devised. It&#39;s an elegant solution that will surely give rise to Masters and Apprentices, as players learn their craft. The quality and quantity of the products and commodities created and traded are reflective of the skills and skill levels of the craftsmen and the members of the community.
