Eugh, never mind. My friend needs to re-code some of it to get it working with 1.3.2 . If you would like to  fix it up, (its for forge, made for 1.2.5, but needs an update) i (and him) would appreciate it. (He kinda gave up on modding, he was kinda basic.)

I declared myself king of the server early on, because being the only op I have divine right and so on, but my one friend protested and demanded a bill of rights. Okay, sure, and I wrote one up, but with a modification to the right to religious expression. This didn&#39;t go over well, and so my friend bombed the commons in protest, destroying the only enchanting table and obsidian generator we had manage to make together. I responded by burning the Constitution.

This then lead to him seceding from my kingdom and declaring his own republic across a convenient river that cleanly divides the world. He took 2 members with him and recruited another 2, I believe. Set up some ugly-ass forts and monstrous flags and crosses. My nation of 3 responded by putting up an [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Sign&quot;]elder sign[/URL] and building a siege fort with obsidian lining in the walls. A bridge was put up between the nations with the promise that no one would cross without permission. My friend crossed, tripped a mine, and blew it all to hell. Woops. We tried to cover up the damage, but failing, just decided to chop down his cross and humorously rebuild it as if it had been felled by a lumber jack.

The Kingdom of the East and the Republic of Desert Pines was then met by a nation of 2- the Neutral Territory, located way far to the east- at least a 2 days&#39; walk, which provided a great natural barrier to invasion. Which was a good idea, too, because things heated up. I built a fort, in creative one day. It was out in the bay separating our nations, but someone closer to his side. I wasn&#39;t even finished building it, but that evening I logged on to see it had been boarded and claimed by the enemy, and a giant cross erected in the center.

My response was to build a TNT cannon on my shores and begin bombarding the fort, quite successfully, causing significant damage. I wasn&#39;t concerned about being unfair- it was my fort as far as I was concerned. After the bombardment, since he was the only member of his nation on to my 3, I readied the troops and we made a valiant charge to retake the rubble of what used to be my fort. After a few tough battles, we were outmatched, and he managed to repel us (one of us was competent but undersupplied, another was new to the PC version and not very agile). The next day the enemy built a giant statue of Gerlad from Hey Arnold! over the fort for whatever reason, which we then burned.

We came to terms and decided to rebuild the fort as a mutual trading post, which I designed and we were both happy with. I allowed them to build a subway from his land to the Neutral Territory, where we both set up embassies. By this time, they only had 2 forts, but my nation was bustling and far larger in size, expanding nearly 2 days in walking from the northernmost settlement of Kornmarke to the southernmost Capitol City (to be named). At one point there was a 4 day creative-a-thon where everyone was given creative mode to build (only rule was no creating resources for hoarding or for use in survival), because of protests that my occasional use of creative was unfair. At one point one of the enemy&#39;s older, ugly forts may have completely disappeared from the face of the earth, without a trace, as a douchey prank. When that came to an end, I de-opped myself, and everyone was reverted to survival mode, so now it&#39;s completely legit.

The threat of war is constantly there, but we&#39;re getting along for now. Right now both sides are just trying to get all the resources they can.

Cows are forced into one small area, I kill the adults, and their loot goes in an obsidian pipe into a chest
they get sex, I get steak, everybody wins

also the chicken lays eggs, then I throw the eggs at it, making more chickens hatch
more chickens = more eggs = more loot</span>
