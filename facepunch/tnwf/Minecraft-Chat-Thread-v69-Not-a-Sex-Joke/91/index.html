It&#39;s dead. 

I&#39;ve given up on playing the game and I&#39;ve given up on the devs doing anything to fix it. 

They&#39;ve made their money, they did as little as possible so that they could &quot;release&quot; the game and not be called scammers, and now they can quit. And there&#39;s nothing to keep all but the most autismic players interested.

The only modders good enough to do full-conversion mods, and thus fix the combat or add interesting things, would be doing it for a community of morons, spergs, and children.

And don&#39;t get your hopes up, Jeb or whoever else does the coding is only doing it on a whim, like a hobbyist. Why do I use the word hobbyist? Because the modders who do things on a whim, for no money, can and have done better than him.

It&#39;s simple, this is a dying game and I give it until some time in 2013 before it doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s subforum."

It&#39;s dead. 

I&#39;ve given up on playing the game and I&#39;ve given up on the devs doing anything to fix it. 

They&#39;ve made their money, they did as little as possible so that they could &quot;release&quot; the game and not be called scammers, and now they can quit. And there&#39;s nothing to keep all but the most autismic players interested.

The only modders good enough to do full-conversion mods, and thus fix the combat or add interesting things, would be doing it for a community of morons, spergs, and children.

And don&#39;t get your hopes up, Jeb or whoever else does the coding is only doing it on a whim, like a hobbyist. Why do I use the word hobbyist? Because the modders who do things on a whim, for no money, can and have done better than him.

It&#39;s simple, this is a dying game and I give it until some time in 2013 before it doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s subforum.[/QUOTE]
 
Isn&#39;t this what you said last year, rrunyan? 

Just because some of our favorite servers have died, Goose&#39;s and Profan&#39;s (the latter being seasonal, and full of rational, sane, non-autistic people), that doesn&#39;t mean the entire community is dead. You simply have to find the right servers.

And, let&#39;s be honest, Facepunch is filled with morons, spergs, and children. Any server hosted for Facepunch will, by extension, contain such a populace. It&#39;s not quite a representative sample of the Minecraft community (which, as it stands, is also made of morons, spergs, and children... At around the same levels as Facepunch). 

That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t places that aren&#39;t full of idiots... It&#39;s that they&#39;re perhaps rarer than they should be. I&#39;d recommend Inacio&#39;s FTB, Profan&#39;s Survival, and a few others I won&#39;t disclose here (they&#39;re private affairs, whitelisted and invite-only)."

I don&#39;t have as much of a problem with hunger as everyone else seems to have, but something that could make it better is if each food type was balanced in the way that effects are applied to your person.

This way we would get more stuff for The Nether, then for The End and so on. Because at the moment all they do is come up with a great idea, implement it in a half assed way and then move on to another idea.</span>

                        <postrender input="Actually hunger stops regenning when you&#39;re missing 2 chops, not just one. The less hunger you have, the slower it regenerates, though.

I wonder how it&#39;d play out if the Hunger system were changed to be a kind of slider of regen. At 5 chops, you do not regenerate at all. At 5 and a half, you regenerate very slowly while at 4 and half you lose health very slowly. The exact position could be changed by difficulty, also, so Hard would require that you stay at least 6 chops, while Easy would lower it to 4?

The Hunger potion effect also needs to be tweaked to cause a more consistant drain. Currently if your saturation is full the Hunger effect does nothing at all (if you haven&#39;t mined a block, sprinted or gotten hit in any way since your last spawn, for example), while your hunger bar is doomed to drain if you&#39;ve been running around a lot or getting hit, which means that it&#39;s a further punishment for performing poorly or even just being hit if PvP is on regardless of how much damage you actually took from the other player. I do like that standing still when hit with hunger is a valid thing - it means you can take a step back and not be hit as hard as someone who just berserks everything in sight while taking every hit, though.

Also no potions of instant food, instant hunger, starvation and fullness (or whatever hunger regen would be called)"

Food takes more to replenish, but they also added meals (There&#39;s a randomly generated combination system, and different food combinations create different filling/power/etc, and sometimes effects that last a few minutes), which is quite godly. 

It also works well with the health bar. You have a lot more health, but it takes DAYS to replenish health, and sleeping replenishes 1/4th of it. It really makes you be more careful, kind of like early minecraft when you could only carry so much food and your armor would only last so long.

Sprinting consumes about 10% of your stamina per second, jumping consumes about 10% (yes this would severely limit mobility in mountains)

Regenerating stamina costs hunger (about 1 unit of hunger per 2 bars of stamina), as does regenerating health (1 unit of hunger per 4 units of health), mining or placing blocks consumes a tiny bit, and it gradually declines passively (very, very slowly - should take about 2 minutes to lose one full point of hunger if you&#39;re just walking around not doing much - about 40 minutes to a hunger bar)

At full hunger you have 100% stamina and health regen. Your health regen slows by 10% every unit of hunger, so 10 units of hunger means you no longer regenerate health. Then your stamina regen starts going at the same speed for the remaining 10 units, and at 0 hunger you no longer regenerate health or stamina. If you&#39;re out of stamina at 0 hunger, you start taking damage, so if you play your cards right and don&#39;t need to sprint or jump you can survive starvation."
