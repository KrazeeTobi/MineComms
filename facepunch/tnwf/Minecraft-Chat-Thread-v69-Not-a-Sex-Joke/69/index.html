On a lighter note, I had a dream last night that seems somewhat related to Minecraft. I was in some rocky deserty place that looked like it was in America or the Mediterranean, and I was digging this large canyon through the mountainous area. Given that this dream was in the usual real-life graphics style, it actually looked pretty awesome, though I had to stop digging once I approached a pool of water that seemed to be connected to a rushing river. I recall two people walking down the canyon path towards the old barely-inhabited &quot;ghost town&quot; that the canyon ended at; I assume they were either mountaineers or just travellers.

Strangely, I had no pickaxe; only a shovel, so I can guess all my picks had been worn out, which is worrying since in Minecraft I make sure to repair my Iron Pickaxes when they&#39;re almost completely worn out, with only the occasional breakage and &quot;GODDAMNIT!&quot; breaking that particular pattern. Looking back at my work, I saw this strange abandoned building up on one of the mountainous outcrops; it looked like a cross between a church, an old hospital and St Francis&#39; Folly from Tomb Raider. I don&#39;t think I went to explore there, since I later found myself in a building that seemed to be a cross between a mall and a community centre; there was even what appeared to be a bar, and my first thoughts were &quot;I&#39;d love to order a Jack Daniels and Coke, but I&#39;m only 20 and this is America&quot;.

My guess is that the source material for this dream was memories of my job on Thursday clearing out plant-life from this decommissioned railway station at West Grinstead, memories of the Milk Bar from Majora&#39;s Mask (I had been watching plenty of ChuggaaConroy&#39;s Majora&#39;s Mask LP recently), memories of my time in the American Southwest, memories of New Vegas, and of course memories of Minecraft.

Just something cool that happened to me last night."

Looking back at my work, I saw this strange abandoned building up on one of the mountainous outcrops; it looked like a cross between a church, an old hospital and St Francis&#39; Folly from Tomb Raider. I don&#39;t think I went to explore there, since I later found myself in a building that seemed to be a cross between a mall and a community centre; there was even what appeared to be a bar, and my first thoughts were &quot;I&#39;d love to order a Jack Daniels and Coke, but I&#39;m only 20 and this is America&quot;.

My guess is that the source material for this dream was memories of my job on Thursday clearing out plant-life from this decommissioned railway station at West Grinstead, memories of the Milk Bar from Majora&#39;s Mask (I had been watching plenty of ChuggaaConroy&#39;s Majora&#39;s Mask LP recently), memories of my time in the American Southwest, memories of New Vegas, and of course memories of Minecraft.

Just something cool that happened to me last night.</span>

Or maybe set it up so that there are two bow items; one is like a crossbow and functions as bows do currently with the charge time, and the other one is the old rapid-fire bow. If the rapid-fire bow needs nerfing, then you could just halve the damage it deals or something."

Mystcraft and extrabiomes is a very good combination.

Not sure if the lack of optifine preinstalled was the best choice, not that I really need it."

Should be the other way round - bows have the charge time and crossbows don&#39;t. &quot;Charging up&quot; a crossbow shot makes no sense as you just pull the trigger to fire the bolt once it&#39;s loaded and cocked. You need to pull back the string with bows so it makes sense that you can &quot;charge&quot; them up to get a more powerful shot.
Repeating crossbows would actually be a really cool addition to minecraft, the only unfitting thing is the sprite for them - it&#39;d have to be horizontal instead of vertical (because god forbid we have actual viewmodels for weapons)."

My current manor is a weaving mess of rooms originally intended for multiple players until my friend decided he wanted to build his own house in the mountains.  Is there a checklist of the rooms I should have in a house?

Also, what are some practical redstone applications?  The most complicated thing I&#39;ve made so far is a two-floor, three-column smooth stone generator, and I want to get better at using redstone.

Third question: If I start a tunnel at, say, x=500 and z=0, then make a big square around the origin (which is near the spawn point), what are the chances of hitting a stronghold?"

 The thing is the main challenge of the game is resource management. The rest is just building. So when you add a mod that makes it so you can turn any resource into any other resource, especially when you have a lot of other mods that feature automation and you can basically automate the collection of a certain resource, resource management goes out the window and all you have to do is build. Which I mean is fine, but you might as well just give yourself resources and not have to deal with it."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Rammlied;38508328]The thing is the main challenge of the game is resource management. The rest is just building. So when you add a mod that makes it so you can turn any resource into any other resource, especially when you have a lot of other mods that feature automation and you can basically make automate the collection of a certain resource, resource management goes out the window and all you have to do is build. Which I mean is fine, but you might as well just give yourself resources and not have to deal with it.[/QUOTE]
