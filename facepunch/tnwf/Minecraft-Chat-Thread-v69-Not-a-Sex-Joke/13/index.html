 I don&#39;t really see how that&#39;s tedious.

When I say harder, I don&#39;t mean hard in the way you&#39;re going to die, I just mean harder as in certain things cost more materials, you have to be careful when you&#39;re doing certain things, and you have to manage things more.

Wear a full suit of iron armor enchanted with protection I.  Nothing will harm you (except lava duh), no diamonds or extensive experience required (except to make the enchanting table).  You can take creeper blasts to the face as well as long drops and keep going.  Also listen closely, because you can still hear creepers&#39; footsteps, especially on dirt.  Of course, the newer patches seem to have a bug (or feature...) where the player can make footsteps randomly by turning on the spot...

Also you should ask them what difficulty it&#39;s on because I think servers default to easy unless you change it in the config file."

i know. i&#39;m just for some reason really freaked out by creepers. i know i could survive them, but something with them just scares the pants off me.

edit: ironicly the one thing that made me have the most reaction from a scare in minecraft was a skeleton.
i was out mining with my friend being in a ravine underground and out of nowhere a skeleton falls in front of me and shoot me. that was the first time something scared me so much i literarily screamed into the mic. and in a instincual raction i jumped backwards. right into a pit of lava"

i know. i&#39;m just for some reason really freaked out by creepers. i know i could survive them, but something with them just scares the pants off me.

edit: ironicly the one thing that made me have the most reaction from a scare in minecraft was a skeleton.
i was out mining with my friend being in a ravine underground and out of nowhere a skeleton falls in front of me and shoot me. that was the first time something scared me so much i literarily screamed into the mic. and in a instincual raction i jumped backwards. right into a pit of lava</span>

For me it just bothers me how they&#39;re everywhere all the time. As many creepers spawn as any other mob, which frankly is pretty stupid given that they&#39;re the only mob that&#39;s actually destructive, plus they don&#39;t burn in sunlight so for the entire day you&#39;re still stranded in a sea of goddamn creepers.

I rent a server in the US, too, but I&#39;m in Australia. I wanted the people I know to be able to play fine so I got a US server, but that leaves me with ~600 ping (at the best of times - usually it&#39;s about 800. An actual ping packet makes the round trip in under 200ms, but Minecraft&#39;s netcode is fucking terrible, so meh.)

If you&#39;ve never played on a server with 600 ping, it&#39;s actually not that bad - you only rubberband if the server is actually lagging internally, and generally you still don&#39;t get block rollbacks that often. But creepers at that latency are [i]fucking terrible[/i]. Mobs barely sync up to their actual positions. If they&#39;re moving towards you, it&#39;s no big deal, since the direction you&#39;re attacking in won&#39;t change so you won&#39;t miss, but with creepers it&#39;s a case of distance and there is literally no way to judge that. I can sprint-hit a creeper away from me, it&#39;ll be 16 blocks away and detonate EXACTLY WHERE I AM STANDING AND KILL ME. Almost every single time. In all my time playing with that kind of latency - which is nearly all my time playing Minecraft multiplayer at all - I&#39;ve survived ONE creeper detonation, by half a heart.

So I made a mod that disables creepers. Entirely. They do not spawn, because fuck those guys. (I don&#39;t seem to have a copy of it on this computer, though)"

Round a corner and you see a Creeper? Block. See one heading towards you? Block. Notice one off in the distance? Take it out unless you are absolutely one hundred percent sure that it doesn&#39;t have a path to you.

Also, make sure to keep your sword at the ready, and only switch to your pick when you find a mining site."
