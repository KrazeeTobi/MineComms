You know how ravines under an ocean just cause a mild column of water to fall to the bottom? Imagine an ocean completely flooding into a ravine. It would spread through a cave system, and using the code that&#39;s already in the game it would behave in the same way that real water does. Meaning it would go downwards into caves but not back up, creating air pockets inside of them. I always figured this would be so cool, because you could be walking through a cave that you entered on land, only to discover that a section of it is flooded with water. This leads you to have to dive down, and continue forward in search of another pocket of air. This would add a whole other level of difficulty to caves. 

I&#39;ve always wanted mojang to add scuba helmets. Like being able to craft a helmet out of glass (like you craft every other helmet). The helmet alone would be useless, but if you could carry air sacs (inksacs + slimeball in crafting square) to increase how much breath you could hold underwater. Each sack would increase your breath by maybe 1/2 of it&#39;s current capacity, but they wouldn&#39;t stack. This means that if you wanted to, you could fill your entire inventory with them and be able to breathe underwater for 2+ minutes, you just wouldn&#39;t have any room for anything else.[/QUOTE]

There&#39;s really no point to make a system to expose all the blocks in the area. The best system simply involves not exposing the same block twice (Which is kind of impossible, but you want to minimize it). No matter how you mine you&#39;re still mining blocks, you&#39;re going to mine the same amount of blocks if you do a complex system or if you just mine in a straight line.

As another note, 1x1x5 holes every so often when branch mining. I started using that method and I find a lot more ores."

Also, dmiller, do you think you could create a mod to remove the anvil damaging aspect and level limitations when in creative mode? Or at least the level limitations since you can re-place the anvil easily enough.

Actually outright removing the damaging aspect of it would be appreciate, or you could change it to get more damaged as it suffers falls, where larger falls damage it quicker. Is that even possible?[/QUOTE]
