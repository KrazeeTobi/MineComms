Which IS being worked on. Go check out XCompWiz&#39;s twitch.tv channel streams, there&#39;s a lot of cool stuff upcoming.</span>

I rather like having dimensional homes. One home (factory-looking) for industry on a mushroom-biome flatworld to prevent creepers spawning where I lay wires, one home for Thaumology (wizzard tower looking) on an Autumn-Forest-and-whatever-else-it-gives-me (usually snow) flatworld, and one for general Minecrafting in an overworld duplicate. And in the actual overworld, I have the book links to each dimensional home as well as to the Nether (and the End if i&#39;ve gotten there myself).

When I want to practice something new, I make a new Myst age just so that if I blow something up, I live and learn. I&#39;ve lost resources but the rest of my stuff is unharmed and I can make a new Myst age and try again. It also means if I fuck up with Thaumology, I don&#39;t get wisps attacking me when i&#39;m doing science in a different age."

Adventure mode is designed for adventure maps. It removes your ability to place blocks altogether, and you can only destroy a block if you have the proper tool, which means when you&#39;re given only a sword and armour you can&#39;t go around destroying the enviroment or punching holes through walls to cheat your way through."

Personally, I&#39;d like to see more things in Minecraft that reward exploration, like crumbling city ruins or actual extensive temples. Also, we need more things to help us get around like hookshots or the ability to walk up 1-block rises like in that one mod. In other words, like an open-world Zelda game. (and yes, I&#39;ve been playing Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess recently, and loving it; I beat the Stallord by ridin&#39; the Spinnaz)

Also, why not have different &quot;campaign&quot; setups, like different things appear in the world depending on what setting you choose, leading you through different dynamic settings and all that. Hell, you could click &quot;Select Random Setting&quot;, and you could enter a world and discover it without knowing what adventure you&#39;re getting into."

Way back in the buildup to beta 1.8, that was the impression that I was getting: we&#39;d have all sorts of new adventure-y things added to the game, like ruins and structures and subterranean fortresses and all sorts.

We certainly got that, but not at all in the capacity that was imagined. The generation for both terrain and structures was (and still kind of is) downright terrible, and I never found a stronghold that wasn&#39;t marred by retarded layouts and glitched generation. There was never anything good on the surface either, with the exception of villages, and we know how &#39;meh&#39; they are, and the only other new thing added underground was the mineshafts, and everybody can see what a clusterfuck that turned out to be."
