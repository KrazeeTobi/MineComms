                        <postrender input="Personally I think there shouldn&#39;t be an overarching morality system in this game; by default your character should be sort of amoral, a blank slate of a Lone Wizard of Technology. Actions over the course of the game shouldn&#39;t paint you as good or evil for all to see; those kinds of dual morality systems are stupid and can result in some stupid choices when done wrong, which is almost all the time.

Personally, I think that &quot;morality&quot; in terms of villages should be in regards to &quot;preference&quot;, and on a settlement-by-settlement basis like in Space Pirates And Zombies, a game I&#39;ve been playing a fair bit of. Also, instead of simply &quot;like&quot; and &quot;hate&quot;, it should be more than just that; for example, a village could hate you if you are annoying and thieflike, such as looting their chests, smashing their pots, generally being a nuisance to the community, which would drive them to take action against you. However, doing things like killing villagers, destroying houses, using explosives and whatnot, those things would make the villagers fear you, making them more defensive and likely to flee if they see you being hostile.

This way, you could destroy/piss off an entire village and it would only affect that community&#39;s sentiments, whilst a town on the far side of the map would not know of your jerkish/cuntish transgressions, and thus you could &quot;atone&quot; for those by doing good things for another village, such as planting crops, building houses, growing trees, teaching Villagers various practices, etc. The difference between being a dick to a village and being a protector/creator would be that whilst the former yields the material spoils of what the village has to offer, with swings of sword and pick being all that is needed, the latter yields great power in the form of XP, similar to Okami&#39;s Praise system. Villagers would have a set amount of &quot;Praise XP&quot; within them per day, and performing praiseworthy actions will yield some of it from them, so one cannot &quot;farm&quot; it by planting a massive amount of Trees or building a few houses, since many would be &quot;Praised-out&quot; after the first few miraculously-sprouted Trees or the first well-built home.

Also, in regards to &quot;alignment&quot; being connected to power, that should be connected to spirits and deities. I was thinking there&#39;d be two main &quot;varieties&quot; of deities; Spirits and Daemons, based around Faith and Luck respectively. Faith Spirits would reward continued worship/offerings/sacrifices with things to buy with your &quot;XP&quot;, favouring dedication and commitment, with &quot;Icons&quot; being used to contact them, make &quot;transactions&quot;, and other things related to traditional worship. On the other hand, Luck Daemons would be more fickle and &quot;chancy&quot;, preferring to dabble in matters of play and fate, handing you their twisted &quot;Implements&quot; to play with and saying &quot;go nuts&quot;; using an Implement gives a random outcome of varying benefit or detriment and uses up some XP. Whilst Icons would not be upgradeable, Implements would, but upgrading them would increase the potency of both the good and bad outcomes, making them high risk high reward."

                            <span v-pre>Personally I think there shouldn&#39;t be an overarching morality system in this game; by default your character should be sort of amoral, a blank slate of a Lone Wizard of Technology. Actions over the course of the game shouldn&#39;t paint you as good or evil for all to see; those kinds of dual morality systems are stupid and can result in some stupid choices when done wrong, which is almost all the time.

Personally, I think that &quot;morality&quot; in terms of villages should be in regards to &quot;preference&quot;, and on a settlement-by-settlement basis like in Space Pirates And Zombies, a game I&#39;ve been playing a fair bit of. Also, instead of simply &quot;like&quot; and &quot;hate&quot;, it should be more than just that; for example, a village could hate you if you are annoying and thieflike, such as looting their chests, smashing their pots, generally being a nuisance to the community, which would drive them to take action against you. However, doing things like killing villagers, destroying houses, using explosives and whatnot, those things would make the villagers fear you, making them more defensive and likely to flee if they see you being hostile.

This way, you could destroy/piss off an entire village and it would only affect that community&#39;s sentiments, whilst a town on the far side of the map would not know of your jerkish/cuntish transgressions, and thus you could &quot;atone&quot; for those by doing good things for another village, such as planting crops, building houses, growing trees, teaching Villagers various practices, etc. The difference between being a dick to a village and being a protector/creator would be that whilst the former yields the material spoils of what the village has to offer, with swings of sword and pick being all that is needed, the latter yields great power in the form of XP, similar to Okami&#39;s Praise system. Villagers would have a set amount of &quot;Praise XP&quot; within them per day, and performing praiseworthy actions will yield some of it from them, so one cannot &quot;farm&quot; it by planting a massive amount of Trees or building a few houses, since many would be &quot;Praised-out&quot; after the first few miraculously-sprouted Trees or the first well-built home.

Also, in regards to &quot;alignment&quot; being connected to power, that should be connected to spirits and deities. I was thinking there&#39;d be two main &quot;varieties&quot; of deities; Spirits and Daemons, based around Faith and Luck respectively. Faith Spirits would reward continued worship/offerings/sacrifices with things to buy with your &quot;XP&quot;, favouring dedication and commitment, with &quot;Icons&quot; being used to contact them, make &quot;transactions&quot;, and other things related to traditional worship. On the other hand, Luck Daemons would be more fickle and &quot;chancy&quot;, preferring to dabble in matters of play and fate, handing you their twisted &quot;Implements&quot; to play with and saying &quot;go nuts&quot;; using an Implement gives a random outcome of varying benefit or detriment and uses up some XP. Whilst Icons would not be upgradeable, Implements would, but upgrading them would increase the potency of both the good and bad outcomes, making them high risk high reward.</span>

nice idea, but unfortunately I&#39;m still limited to how the villagers are coded as of now. with forge, I can completely bypass the vanilla combat system and replace it with my own, but I don&#39;t have the same level of control with villagers.

In megaman the combat gameplay was great, but all Megaman could do was jump and shoot, while the monsters could do cool jumps and stuff. Make mobs have unique attack patterns or behaviors that the player has to work around (For instance, my idea to make zombies travel in groups, be unaffected by knockback, and to grab/slow the player when they attack them, so the player has to backtrack from an army of tanks instead of just swinging their sword a few times.[/QUOTE]
 
Ah... Remember when Notch said that mobs would have (and even had, in development versions) attack animations and new tactics?

Wasn&#39;t that great being lied to?"
