As far as I understand it, this isn&#39;t due to using &quot;Minecraft&quot; in the name, but due to using a name that suggests the possibility that it&#39;s a sequel of any sort to Minecraft instead. &quot;Minecraft cubed&quot; could also be read as &quot;Minecraft three&quot; as though it&#39;s a further game in a non-existent series, which Mojang don&#39;t want."

As far as I understand it, this isn&#39;t due to using &quot;Minecraft&quot; in the name, but due to using a name that suggests the possibility that it&#39;s a sequel of any sort to Minecraft instead. &quot;Minecraft cubed&quot; could also be read as &quot;Minecraft three&quot; as though it&#39;s a further game in a non-existent series, which Mojang don&#39;t want.</span>

No, not suing. They&#39;re requesting that the website and mod name be changed before anything further should happen, but no money is involved as of yet. I think Dinnerbone has talked about this on his twitter."

So changing the name of the game to Minecraft Cubed instead of Minecraft^3 would be fine? And they&#39;d still be able to keep their website since there website says Cubed and not 3?</span>

                            <span v-pre>Hmm, computercraft was updated. Modems, when accessed as a peripheral, now have channels. 

[url]http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/10343-15-in-depth-modem-channels-tutorial/[/url]

So, you can have 128 channels open at any time (Per modem, I think) and there&#39;s 65535 possible channels. Since I have a long weekend, I might take a crack at making a network.</span>
