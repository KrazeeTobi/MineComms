Fire spread was cool because it was the only thing that could destroy your base (Unless you used stone, of course), and because it was somewhat predictable you had to build your base with fire in mind. The fact that it&#39;s finite completely ruins it.

Anyway, I was thinking of creating a heavily modded client to dick around in. I was thinking of that one cute maids mod, maybe one of the weapons mod (Which one is the best?), but I don&#39;t really know of any good ones. Do you guys have any suggestions? Maybe something that makes minecraft a bit harder would be neat."

Depends on shooting style as to where you draw to. Chest and cheek are equally viable too dependant on bow, style of shooting etc. With my traditional bow I draw to my right cheek, just below my right eye.

The reason it appears awkward is that a) the minecraft persons arm is a bit too short and b) when you shoot your arm isnt across your body like that, you generally shoot sideways on."
