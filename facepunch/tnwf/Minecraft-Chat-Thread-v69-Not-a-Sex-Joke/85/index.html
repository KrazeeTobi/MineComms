Has anybody tried to re-imagine minecraft as how the concept art and models produced by Hayden Scott-Baron? I don&#39;t necessarily mean in-game but just anything, prerendered or in any game engine. I&#39;d like to see someone&#39;s interpretation of what the game could have been.[/QUOTE]
 
His stuff is too super-kawaii for Minecraft imo, only because the direction it&#39;s been taken in.

Though if his models can be successfully animated in-engine with no major SMP problem, then that begs the question:

Why aren&#39;t we using better models?</span>

I&#39;m just asking if anybody&#39;s tried to branch off and create an interpretation minecraft other than just one-off models of characters. I really wanna see if someone&#39;s done some badass render or something like a UDK scene that takes the blocks and mobs of minecraft and makes a full piece out of it in another style.

But I agree, there is no reason that the current models (and especially unacceptable quality default texturing) should still be in there other than laziness or a desire to not try something new.

Honestly I feel like it really kills a lot of the potential minecraft had that they aren&#39;t willing to play around with the style. Right now it&#39;s just so bland and bad without texture packs and/or mods, and even then the models are just boxes upon boxes when they could be so much more and still retain a blocky feel."

I like the minecraft art style.
I think if they added any player models or mobs which were made of anything but cuboids it would ruin the look and feel."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=DOG-GY;38803623]I don&#39;t think it was too &quot;kawaii&quot; feeling, especially with this piece:
[img]http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/7666/1622653-tumblr_kv2hgo4nel1qzb7ox.jpg[/img]
As for the direction minecraft&#39;s taken, I don&#39;t think any particular style doesn&#39;t suit it (except realism and the horrible programmer art that is currently the default textures)


I&#39;m just asking if anybody&#39;s tried to branch off and create an interpretation minecraft other than just one-off models of characters. I really wanna see if someone&#39;s done some badass render or something like a UDK scene that takes the blocks and mobs of minecraft and makes a full piece out of it in another style.

But I agree, there is no reason that the current models (and especially unacceptable quality default texturing) should still be in there other than laziness or a desire to not try something new.

Honestly I feel like it really kills a lot of the potential minecraft had that they aren&#39;t willing to play around with the style. Right now it&#39;s just so bland and bad without texture packs and/or mods, and even then the models are just boxes upon boxes when they could be so much more and still retain a blocky feel.[/QUOTE]
 
I like the minecraft art style.
I think if they added any player models or mobs which were made of anything but cuboids it would ruin the look and feel.</span>

I prefer it because I like my texture to be consistent, every pack I&#39;ve tried changes way too much leading to confusion about what a block / items is, in addition should there be an update to Minecraft it potentially breaks the pack which is highly annoying.
I use a lot of mods as well so finding a pack that supports all of them is next to impossible without dicking around with multiple packs."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Drakortha;38808439]Do you guys think in like a few years time the average computer will be able to smash Minecraft? I mean with games like Morrowind when it came out you needed a powerful computer. But these days you can get mods that allow for unlimited view distance and most computers can run it.

Looking forward to the future where we might be able to have every chunk loaded with super view distance ;)[/QUOTE]
 
I think it would be fine to be able to see maybe a max of 50 chunks out from you, which would allow you to see 800 meters in each direction, or half a mile.</span>

We’re looking to do a 1.4.6 before Christmas, with the normal pre-release a few days ahead. Monday maybe? Anyway, changes since last week:

Tweaked fireworks effect and sounds
Item entities are rendered as 3d objects in the world
Corrected how enchanted books work, and added them to villagers and chests
Added “thorns” enchantment
Added tool highlight when switching items in the hotbar
Added a notice/warning for users still playing on PowerPCs or Java 5 (Java 1.5)
Various bug fixes
