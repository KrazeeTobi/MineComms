You can make a portal by carving a 2x2x1 hole in the ground, filling it with water, surrounding it with flowers and a diamond thrown in the mix

the diamond gets thrown in last, it&#39;ll create lightning and the water will turn to portal

From there, have fun exploring the twilight forest[/QUOTE]

Group catacomb raids are fun. Especially when only half the group survives.

(If you don&#39;t know the catacomb mod it allows you to generate huge dungeons with secrets, loot, traps, monsters and multiple levels. You cannot use TP commands to get in or out so once you get in you die or finish the dungeon)"

we should totally do something like this. just a big collab of all of you into one massive island that we all add too over time, turning it into a major city

we&#39;ll have all the best buildings in this. not only will it look good 
but it also gives people ideas on how they can improve their OWN cities and houses then they leave their mark 
it&#39;s different from a server, because i don&#39;t know about you, but i enjoy playing on my own, and on a server too many times has someone just run up to me and dumped a bucket&#39;o&#39;lava on my wooden house, this way it completely removes that risk and gives you a nice starting point to build up on

the file is up anyway for anyone who wants it.[/QUOTE]
 
I would, if we had a strict system for this and a reliable method/place for uploading the save. Someone would have to post to let everyone know that they&#39;re working on their build so that we don&#39;t get divergent versions. We might also have to agree on a theme or build guidelines or something for consistency, because one person&#39;s idea of &quot;medieval&quot; is probably different from another person&#39;s."

we should totally do something like this. just a big collab of all of you into one massive island that we all add too over time, turning it into a major city

we&#39;ll have all the best buildings in this. not only will it look good 
but it also gives people ideas on how they can improve their OWN cities and houses then they leave their mark 
it&#39;s different from a server, because i don&#39;t know about you, but i enjoy playing on my own, and on a server too many times has someone just run up to me and dumped a bucket&#39;o&#39;lava on my wooden house, this way it completely removes that risk and gives you a nice starting point to build up on

the file is up anyway for anyone who wants it.[/QUOTE]
 
I would, if we had a strict system for this and a reliable method/place for uploading the save. Someone would have to post to let everyone know that they&#39;re working on their build so that we don&#39;t get divergent versions. We might also have to agree on a theme or build guidelines or something for consistency, because one person&#39;s idea of &quot;medieval&quot; is probably different from another person&#39;s.</span>

no it doesn&#39;t :v:

it&#39;s just a silly little thing that occupies our time and keeps the thread going
i never said there was a theme
and as for uploading/downloading the latest version of the map, adding a house takes all of 5 mins and after someone posts a newer version the person before snips their post. it&#39;s quite easy

personally, i think it&#39;d be very funny to, for instance have my medieval-ish looking shop in that photo right next door to a futuristic echanting wizard tower made of metal

that map is [B]HUGE[/B], the first island (of three) is massive and you could quite easily fit 7 of those cities on to it and still have room for a farm, maybe the first island is a medieval island, the second is a Futuristic diamond paradise and the third is a lava hell, it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s just for fun.

On the default Minecraft server, default FTB server, or the LAN option for either, there is no way to enable it for other players. You require another mod or server wrapper to be able to create a login message, as the default Minecraft MotD is the message displayed on the server list, not once connected.[/QUOTE]

Mostly personal preference, but do a latency check from where you are to the server location first, if it&#39;s below 150 or so it should be fine."

Mostly personal preference, but do a latency check from where you are to the server location first, if it&#39;s below 150 or so it should be fine.</span>

we should totally do something like this. just a big collab of all of you into one massive island that we all add too over time, turning it into a major city

we&#39;ll have all the best buildings in this. not only will it look good 
but it also gives people ideas on how they can improve their OWN cities and houses then they leave their mark 
it&#39;s different from a server, because i don&#39;t know about you, but i enjoy playing on my own, and on a server too many times has someone just run up to me and dumped a bucket&#39;o&#39;lava on my wooden house, this way it completely removes that risk and gives you a nice starting point to build up on

the file is up anyway for anyone who wants it.[/QUOTE]

To add onto that, Mystcraft has changed quite a lot in the most recent version. It&#39;s more balanced, albeit in a difficult to find things way. Direwolf20 covered a lot of the changes, and I recommend you watch this if you&#39;re going to play around with Mystcraft, else you&#39;ll be lost.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Weiss;39628045]This is pretty much why I hate Rei&#39;s. It&#39;s been updated to the latest version but it hasn&#39;t actually changed in literally years.

Zan&#39;s is infinitely better nowadays, except there&#39;s no way to explicitly disable mob radar in it for the server so it doesn&#39;t get nearly as much popularity with the wider community. Well, that and it&#39;s changed owners several times.

I love the cavemapping in it, too. Automatically switches once you get underground.[/QUOTE]
 
After I switched to Reis, I never bothered to look back at zans. Zans looks a lot better now.

I&#39;m going to try it out.</span>
