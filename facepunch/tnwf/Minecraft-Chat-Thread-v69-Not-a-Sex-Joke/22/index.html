Everyone I know who has it says it&#39;s great, I&#39;m so disappointed with myself for not being able to install it. I want to add it to the server we already have and it&#39;s a &quot;proper&quot; paid/hosted server so people don&#39;t know how to explain to me how to add it in.

Yea I wouldn&#39;t mind it as an option. I liked the addition of having to eat. Before it I never ate food, if I was low on health and in my house I would kill myself, I still made some food for when I went mining but I never really used food. I think drinking wouldn&#39;t be a bad addition to survival, maybe make it so hardcore mode has dehydration in it."

Yea I wouldn&#39;t mind it as an option. I liked the addition of having to eat. Before it I never ate food, if I was low on health and in my house I would kill myself, I still made some food for when I went mining but I never really used food. I think drinking wouldn&#39;t be a bad addition to survival, maybe make it so hardcore mode has dehydration in it.</span>

I&#39;ll never forget my first and only experience on Flak&#39;s server.

I logged on, expecting something hellishly griefed. I was surprised to find a small medieval themed tower instead. Flak greeted me, and soon enough another player joined. His name was highland_macgreggor. We messed around with Flak, using the dragon shouts plugin he had, before heading to the bottom of the tower to build our own houses. Greg built a wood mansion in the middle of a frozen lake, while I built a modest little shack near it.
Greg and I became good friends, and we started mining together, until he decided he wanted to move, and build a bigger, more grand home. I followed him, and we walked for a while until we got to where he built his big mansion. After some exploits underground, we got ourselves quite a bunch of iron, and some diamonds as well. 
Later, I was exploring the area and came across a pretty big warehouse. It was abandoned, and torn to shit, but after killing the spiders that were inside it, I started flattening out the floor for us to use.
Of course, there had to be a secret, and I found a 1x1 hole going way down. So I drop my water, and head down. After a long spiral staircase, I hit the motherlode. 7-8 double chests, full to the brim with iron blocks, gold blocks, and diamond blocks, all encircled by nether portals. I call greg, and we freak out over our luck, before collecting as much as we could carry, and building a hidden storage facility deep under our mansion. The server wasn&#39;t very popular, and usually me and greg were the only ones online. So, we had all diamond gear, tons of tools, and anything we could ever want.
That&#39;s when some sort of moderator logged on. He built his home quite close to ours, and proceeded to  wreck up the forest we had going on around it. His home was built near a cliffside, about midway between our mansion, and the warehouse. I don&#39;t remember the details, but he was kind of dick, and neither Greg or I liked him very much.
One day, when he was offline, we set up TNT traps all around his home.
He took the bait and set off 2-3 of em. We acted innocent, and laughed about it later.
Then we logged on the next day to find our windows smashed, and a ton of signs all saying shit like &quot;ENORMOUS COCKS IN YOUR EYES&quot;. 
So, we griefed his place to hell and back. Water buckets covered the land, all torches were removed, replaced with signs telling him to kill himself, and to lick some &quot;greasy armenian pussy&quot;.
We couldn&#39;t stop fucking laughing, and when he logs back on, he was so pissed. He knew we did it, we knew he knew, so it wasn&#39;t a big surprise when he told Flak. We weren&#39;t banned, but he ceased to live there, and destroyed the original warehouse stash of diamonds after he found it.
We continued to grief him wherever he went, until eventually he just stopped coming back on.
So we stopped as well, and a couple of months later, I wasn&#39;t able to launch minecraft anymore.

That&#39;s pretty much the only reason I want to keep playing this game, and why I hope getting Windows 7 will fix the problem. Shit like that is just too fun to miss."
