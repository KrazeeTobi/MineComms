You know whats funny, Terrafirma Craft is not in the list of TFC acronyms, and googling TFC does not bring anything up for minecraft, even the related searches for TFC show team fortress classic. Both those links do nothing to support the claim that oicani (inacio) is dumb.

There is plenty of acronyms of games or other objects that you do not know that is short for something, it doesn&#39;t make you dumb if you do not know it. Stop being an ass.

Even if a quick google of TFC minecraft would tell you its Terrafirma Craft, one might assume that a previous use of the acronym TFC for team fortress classic might be what everyone is talking about."

You know whats funny, Terrafirma Craft is not in the list of TFC acronyms, and googling TFC does not bring anything up for minecraft, even the related searches for TFC show team fortress classic. Both those links do nothing to support the claim that oicani (inacio) is dumb.

There is plenty of acronyms of games or other objects that you do not know that is short for something, it doesn&#39;t make you dumb if you do not know it. Stop being an ass.

Even if a quick google of TFC minecraft would tell you its Terrafirma Craft, one might assume that a previous use of the acronym TFC for team fortress classic might be what everyone is talking about.</span>

jokes arent as funny when you have to explain them

Now, [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7333627/ShareX/2012-11/2012-11-11_22-30-51.png]earlier in the thread[/url] I was rated dumb for making the TFC = Team Fortress Classic joke. Inacio there made the same joke. Hence, my sarcastic reply saying he would be called dumb. The links I posted (each of which of course illustrating that it could be difficult to discover the meaning of TFC in this context,) helped to underline this point and poke fun at how silly it is to call someone dumb for not knowing this specific type of jargon.

Raptor then responded to my post in a rather stern tone. Now, the projected voice of his statement was rather serious in nature and what little sarcasm he portrayed painted a picture of somebody who was mocking the position that I was lampooning, thus taking my post as if I wasn&#39;t being sarcastic. For this reason I find the position that his post was a &quot;double sarcasm,&quot; redoubling the affirmation that one is dumb for not understanding that TFC= TerraFirmaCraft, to be an untenable one. This led me to believe that he had, in fact, missed the joke.

Now, at least in American English, the idiom &quot;Flying over somebody&#39;s head&quot; means that the person in question did not understand the true meaning of the phrase, joke, or discussion that occurred. When a physical object flies over your head, one could perceive a noise that could be described as a &quot;wooshing&quot; sensation. My comment of &quot;Woosh&quot; playfully jabs at the fact that I indeed believed that Raptor did not correctly understand the statement I had made.

Now, if he had made that post as an attempt at double sarcasm as outlined above, then the &quot;Woosh&quot; statement could be construed as humorous at my expense, underlining the inherent irony in such a post. Again, I find that situation unlikely.

Now, [url=https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7333627/ShareX/2012-11/2012-11-11_22-30-51.png]earlier in the thread[/url] I was rated dumb for making the TFC = Team Fortress Classic joke. Inacio there made the same joke. Hence, my sarcastic reply saying he would be called dumb. The links I posted (each of which of course illustrating that it could be difficult to discover the meaning of TFC in this context,) helped to underline this point and poke fun at how silly it is to call someone dumb for not knowing this specific type of jargon.

Raptor then responded to my post in a rather stern tone. Now, the projected voice of his statement was rather serious in nature and what little sarcasm he portrayed painted a picture of somebody who was mocking the position that I was lampooning, thus taking my post as if I wasn&#39;t being sarcastic. For this reason I find the position that his post was a &quot;double sarcasm,&quot; redoubling the affirmation that one is dumb for not understanding that TFC= TerraFirmaCraft, to be an untenable one. This led me to believe that he had, in fact, missed the joke.

Now, at least in American English, the idiom &quot;Flying over somebody&#39;s head&quot; means that the person in question did not understand the true meaning of the phrase, joke, or discussion that occurred. When a physical object flies over your head, one could perceive a noise that could be described as a &quot;wooshing&quot; sensation. My comment of &quot;Woosh&quot; playfully jabs at the fact that I indeed believed that Raptor did not correctly understand the statement I had made.

Now, if he had made that post as an attempt at double sarcasm as outlined above, then the &quot;Woosh&quot; statement could be construed as humorous at my expense, underlining the inherent irony in such a post. Again, I find that situation unlikely.

I can agree, I did read your post wrong. Sarcasm can also be hard to notice when reading unless its blatantly obvious. I had not noticed your first post about TFC being Team Fortress Classic, if I had I would not have posted as I would have had a basis for the sarcasm.

TFC is an overhaul mod. Instead of adding new things to the game it completely changes the game. I can&#39;t really cover everything but there&#39;s a lot more depth and challenge to it. You have to pick up wrocks, smash them together into tool heads, break leaves to get sticks and craft the head and stick together to make tools. You can&#39;t make stone tools either, so you can&#39;t break stone for a long time (You have to make a metal pick, which means you have to slowly get small ore nuggets off the ground until you can amass one measily ingot to make a pick with). 

There&#39;s a lot of other changes (The land generator is a lot prettier, and there&#39;s more trees and stuff), you kind of just have to play it.

I watch Spumwuck, and he makes tutorials/letsplays for the mod, I&#39;d suggest going to him. He explains it very well.

TFC is an overhaul mod. Instead of adding new things to the game it completely changes the game. I can&#39;t really cover everything but there&#39;s a lot more depth and challenge to it. You have to pick up wrocks, smash them together into tool heads, break leaves to get sticks and craft the head and stick together to make tools. You can&#39;t make stone tools either, so you can&#39;t break stone for a long time (You have to make a metal pick, which means you have to slowly get small ore nuggets off the ground until you can amass one measily ingot to make a pick with). 

There&#39;s a lot of other changes (The land generator is a lot prettier, and there&#39;s more trees and stuff), you kind of just have to play it.

I watch Spumwuck, and he makes tutorials/letsplays for the mod, I&#39;d suggest going to him. He explains it very well.

Very popular minecraft lets players, if you can call it lets plays. They do other games too, like gmod, or whatever comes up.

Some people like them, some people don&#39;t. Knowing facepunch most people probably don&#39;t just because their fanbase is young.

And please, let no more be said so this thread doesn&#39;t turn into a fight for 6 pages."

We haven&#39;t been with an Australian host since early 2012 but yeah that&#39;s us. We call the events &quot;ages&quot; and they are just different world themes created using a mix of different plugins. The last age we had was the Age of Darkness where it was eternal night and snowing constantly with much deadlier mobs. All this while factions duked it out with PVP and fighting the cold (we had a plugin where you needed leather to keep warm). We also have unique events called Rifts where the nether realm spills onto the map causing a world wide attack where the entire server fights the hordes. 

Next age I&#39;m opening a new continent where all the factions will be more contained. Limited resources and limited space, there&#39;s going to be a lot of PVP for those who want it :smile:"
