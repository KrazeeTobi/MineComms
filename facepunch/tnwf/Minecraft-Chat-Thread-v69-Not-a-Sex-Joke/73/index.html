Seeing a handicapped kid in a wheelchair taking a picture with a mojangsta and constantly smiling after it is pretty amazing!</span>

That&#39;s what made seeds like glacier and gargamel great. Extreme mountains are shit, it&#39;s just ugly turquoise lumps of ground with no large flat areas. There needs to be more terrain like in your screenshots.

edit:
I also love plateaus and valleys with trees. It&#39;s what I always look for to build near.[/QUOTE]
 
Biggest reason I&#39;m changing back to 1.3_01 is because of the new terrain generator.

It&#39;s so fucking shit, they just took out all the good things about the old one, like how exciting it was to venture through it and how unusual it was, but now it&#39;s all bland and boring.

Remember when everyone used to talk about the Far Lands and people tried to go there on long journeys? That was awesome."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Jallen;38568482]IMO something that the current terrain generation is really missing is the contrast of flat ground with sharp mountains.
That&#39;s what made seeds like glacier and gargamel great. Extreme mountains are shit, it&#39;s just ugly turquoise lumps of ground with no large flat areas. There needs to be more terrain like in your screenshots.

edit:
I also love plateaus and valleys with trees. It&#39;s what I always look for to build near.[/QUOTE]
 
Biggest reason I&#39;m changing back to 1.3_01 is because of the new terrain generator.

It&#39;s so fucking shit, they just took out all the good things about the old one, like how exciting it was to venture through it and how unusual it was, but now it&#39;s all bland and boring.

Remember when everyone used to talk about the Far Lands and people tried to go there on long journeys? That was awesome.</span>

Mods are very versatile but as Minecraft is right now installing mods is anything but user friendly. We were promised Mod API for 1.4, but Dinnerbone took one look at the code and said &quot;Let&#39;s fix this first&quot;.

I&#39;m betting that we won&#39;t see mod API until 1.6 myself."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=gottifour;38583656]I don&#39;t see why they still constantly update. I might sound a little dumb here, but mods do all the work these days. Stuff like the Pretty Scary Update are cool, but the new redstone update isn&#39;t all needed because most of the stuff in it so far has already been filled by mods. Think of it like HL2. Not many people play THE HL2, but people play GMod and many other mods created from HL2. Minecraft updates should be mainly focused on bugs, which is needed considering some bugs like the black spots are VERY annoying.[/QUOTE]
 
Mods are very versatile but as Minecraft is right now installing mods is anything but user friendly. We were promised Mod API for 1.4, but Dinnerbone took one look at the code and said &quot;Let&#39;s fix this first&quot;.

I&#39;m betting that we won&#39;t see mod API until 1.6 myself.</span>

 That&#39;s it. They should make the Mod API, fix all the bits and bobs, and bam. Final version versatile for all of your mods. I will admit, installing mods is ANNOYING, time-consuming, and sometimes somewhat complicated. Using the Mod API would be great, but like you said, Dinnerbone is jerking around, fixing the petty little things. He also found a fix for the spots, but didn&#39;t use it for reasons I cannot recall.

If Mojang would get their priorities set, that would be great."

That might be kind of subjective, because everyone has different preferences on what direction the game should taken. Personally, the direction that villagers and enchanting have gone in isn&#39;t one that I would have clamored for, but I&#39;m not going to complain at this point. I&#39;d be inclined to say Mystcraft, but I get that it&#39;s rather far-removed from the core precepts of the game."

Using the Mod API would be great, but like you said, Dinnerbone is jerking around, fixing the petty little things. He also found a fix for the spots, but didn&#39;t use it for reasons I cannot recall.

If Mojang would get their priorities set, that would be great.[/QUOTE]
 
Reasons you can&#39;t recall being that recoding the entire lighting engine took time, and their early builds sacrificed speed for quality. (Framerates of 15/s were common.)"

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=gottifour;38583766]That&#39;s it. They should make the Mod API, fix all the bits and bobs, and bam. Final version versatile for all of your mods. I will admit, installing mods is ANNOYING, time-consuming, and sometimes somewhat complicated. Using the Mod API would be great, but like you said, Dinnerbone is jerking around, fixing the petty little things. He also found a fix for the spots, but didn&#39;t use it for reasons I cannot recall.

If Mojang would get their priorities set, that would be great.[/QUOTE]
 
Reasons you can&#39;t recall being that recoding the entire lighting engine took time, and their early builds sacrificed speed for quality. (Framerates of 15/s were common.)</span>

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Jallen;38586500]Personally, I think some more things that we see in mod packs should become part of the game. Buildcraft pipes and redpower wire are two things which I think the game would greatly benefit from, as well as more generation options as seen in Better World Generation (such as beta style world gen) and many other features for automation like quarries for end game advanced play.[/QUOTE]
 
The Redpower tubes are much, much better than the buildcraft pipes.</span>
