There&#39;s a glitch that happens if you stare at an enderman and he teleports, and you still get the stare sound every once and a while.

I only remember this because it kept happening until I quit the game, it was an old snapshot from wayback."

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=pansarkurt;38118086]Guys, i have a very strange story to share with you.
Now, first of all, yes. This is a story starring a strange happenings in minecraft.
No, i dont think its Herobrine, but it is most certainly... something.

My friend started up a survival server earlier today for us to play on. We thought we would try the newest snapshot so all of us installed it and joined the server.

It all started out fairly basic, we teamed up in pairs and started making plans of our future.
Fortresses, farms and the like. Me and my friend was exploring this cave we found on the surface wich led down and into a ravine. So we stuck around for a while and mined what few ores we could find on such a high altitude of the underground. We were mining a vein of coal when suddenly a strange sound
caught our attention.

It started out as a low static, but within seconds got higher and a low moaning sound could be heard.
Me and my friend started freaking out when the moaning got higher and it almost sounded like a scream was building up.

So we ran the fuck up to the surface, scared shitless. Now, ive played minecraft for almost two years now and i have never ever heard anything like that. It was most certainly not an ambience sound because as i turned and ran, i could hear the surround of the sound. It was very close to us, possibly around the corner or on the other side of the stone.

That was our first encounter with this strange phenomenon that we eventually started calling &quot;The groke&quot;, named after the big black ghost from Moomin.

The second encounter was on the surface, in daylight. I was running past my friends house when the static started. I stopped, listened this time for a source. &quot;Hey! Get over here, its back!&quot; I said to my freind. He got there as quick as possible, but the only sound he heard was a faint shhhhh that faded out. 

Now we had three witnesses of this &quot;Groke&quot; so we started trying to figure out what the sound was.
The fact it had surround means it was not ambience but something coming from a source. We went through the resource folder in .minecraft but found nothing unusual.

This simply made no sense. We were all three certain that this was real, it was not our mind playing tricks. Needless to say, this server has got a lot scarier now. Noone dares to mine alone and there is this constant feeling of dread looming over all of us.

I am not trying to be dramatic, and im not making this up. Wether it was something Mojang implemented as a secret for Halloween, or if our minds really are playing tricks on us, it scared us out of our senses.

Does anyone have a reasonable explanation for this &quot;Groke&quot;?

EDIT:
Oh, and did i mention the sound was strangely familiar with the sounds in the broken Disc?[/QUOTE]
 
Reminds me of the time I logged into my Eronev 2 save and got attacked by some invisible creature that seemed to act like a zombie pigman(speed,damage dealt) but it didn&#39;t make any sounds and there was no way that an invisible zombie pigman could get in my base anyways.

I just switched to peaceful,that does wonders for exorcism

Matmos adds some fucking cool sounds to everything. It adds combat sounds like swinging a sword, a sword hitting flesh, hitting other blocks and a blocking sound. It really helps with fighting and makes it more interesting.</span>

                        <postrender input="I mean anyone who can&#39;t see any way to make minecraft combat better is probably blind anyway. [i]Enemies walk into you and deal damage.[/i] It&#39;s literally the most basic possible thing, at some point there had to have been plans to replace it that just got eternally backburnered like 60% of everything else ever.

That, and the lack of variety (Diamond Sword is objectively the best melee weapon in any situation, Bow is the only ranged weapon aside from thrown potions) make for very bland combat.


Having a couple of extra weapontypes that behave differently to swords (such as Balkon&#39;s Weaponmod) and some kind of simple damage type/resistance system and material properties wouldn&#39;t be too far from the overall theme of the game while making things much better. Then make enemies actually attack rather than being walking spikepits, with different attack types.

Plus, adding different manners of attacks would allow us to actually have mob variety without it just being redundant. Right now we have zombies and only zombies as the generic human-behaviour mob, because if there was another one there&#39;d be no way for it to behave not like a zombie aside from moving at a different speed or dealing a different amount of damage - but that&#39;s only really parameters of the existing zombie behaviour, thus you just have to treat it as such. It doesn&#39;t make it new or interesting, it&#39;s just another zombie.


So you could do, say, two extra melee weapon types - a mace and a short spear of some kind - and a three-damagetype system of crushing, piercing and slashing damage (nothing new or innovative there). Swords would deal primarily Slashing damage, Maces Crushing, Spears Piercing.
You could then also add material properties, that dictate what materials are better for what shapes - Diamonds, for instance, would be naturally more suited to piercing shapes since shaping them into an edge is weird - so they&#39;d make better spears (and pickaxes) but worse maces and swords (and axes or hoes), but iron is malleable and easy to work with so it&#39;d make pretty good all-round tools. Conversely armor made of a material would be more resistant to that material&#39;s damagetype than the others (but still be pretty resistant to others). Pickaxes would also deal piercing rather than Slashing damage, and Axes would deal a mix of Slashing and Crushing (since they&#39;re not quite so sharp as swords), Hoes Crushing (but at a much lesser rate) so even your tools have their own place in the combat system if you don&#39;t have a proper weapon on hand.

Enemies could be equipped with different weapons in the case of humanoids like Zombies and Skeletons. Spiders would deal Piercing damage and above a certain amount of damage dealt, cause poisoning (cave spiders always poison) so if you have no armor they&#39;re very dangerous but once you have some armor the poison doesn&#39;t get to you so they&#39;re much less of a threat. Zombies could have Swords, Maces or Spears, and as such deal different types of damage and be more or less dangerous depending on that. Skeletons could have Bows or Spears, and would be much faster moving than zombies making them quite dangerous - unless you have good Piercing armor, since they only have weapons that deal Piercing damage. Enemies would also actually telegraph their attacks - Skeletons would actually draw their bows, spiders would crouch back before leaping to attack you, Zombies would raise their arms before bringing a strike down.

The controls remain the same, it&#39;s still a clickfest but there&#39;s nothing new to learn in terms of gameplay - just strategy.

Also, ranged could use some love, so perhaps a flintlock pistol that deals primarily Crushing damage, and some different ammotypes for pistols and bows - incendiaries, web arrows that spawn cobwebs for a short time, things like that - thus giving you some variety at range as well.

Especially since you would NEED a wiki, because there&#39;s no in-game guide to tell you &quot;Zombies are weak against crushing, this weapon has crushing damage, etc&quot;

It&#39;d be cool if you could pay dojo NPC&#39;s to train you or something and hone certain weapons skills so you do more damage with a certain weapon.  Like a permanent Sword Strength or Bow Damage buff, but only one at a time for a certain time.[/QUOTE]
 
Well, you would probably infer that from the fact that there are Swords, Maces and Spears; but you&#39;d probably also want to give people a concrete notion of damage. You could go the RPG route and show what damage it does most of in the tooltip, and how much as a general read (like &quot;Heavy Slashing Damage&quot; or &quot;Light Piercing Damage&quot;).
As for showing what mobs are weak to what, you could have village guards who have all three types of weapon and swap depending on what they&#39;re fighting - of course, that would mean the player would need to find a village, but it&#39;d make sense for the spawn area to always be a village anyways. It wouldn&#39;t outright say &quot;HEY SKELETONS ARE WEAK TO CRUSHING DAMAGE&quot; but if you observed closely enough - either watching guards fight, or observing how quickly you kill things with different weapons - you&#39;d learn how it works. If materials matched their damage enhancements between armor and weapons (strong piercing damage on weapons = strong piercing resistance on armor) you&#39;d also learn about the armor in the same system, and thus learn how to deal with armored mobs.

But you&#39;ll be playing for a longer period anyway - Minecraft isn&#39;t so &#39;instant gratification&#39;-prone as other games, so it makes sense to not just give you all the information up front.

Also: Hybrid tools. These were my favorite feature of Inficraft, and you could easily integrate them into the system: Pickaxes would do a combination of Slashing and Piercing, Axes Crushing and Slashing and Hoes Piercing and Crushing (gameplay, not logical reasons there) - but do less damage overall since they&#39;re not designed for combat. By adding a different weapon to the tool you could craft a hybrid weapon, which is half as effective as a tool but as effective as a proper weapon for combat - with the strength of the damages effected by the material."
