All day Wednesday, and on through to Thursday night, my server was up and a few of my friends were playing on it. I played on it a little on Wednesday afternoon, then didn&#39;t touch it until the next night. SOMEHOW, on Wednesday night, my friends all lost the ability to connect to my server.

Now, I know this change did not occur because of anything [i]I[/i] did. After I stopped playing on Wednesday, they were still able to stay connected, disconnect, and reconnect a few times. I did not so much as [b]touch[/b] my computer during the time frame that the server stopped working.

I can still enter the server myself, but no outside connections can. The message my friends are getting seems to suggest that it&#39;s an issue with port forwarding or Windows firewall, but if anything like that was the issue, it would have been an issue from the very beginning; it wouldn&#39;t have just started randomly when I wasn&#39;t even touching the computer.

So what could [b]possibly[/b] have happened when nobody was using this computer that would have caused the server to be inaccessible to all outside connections?"

kay thanks wanted to make sure i didnt get banned

so all of these are compatible with 1.4.6 or 1.4.7 but i&#39;m not sure what order to install in, primarily forge, api, and modloader. 

And yes, I realize it will most likely not work (right?) but I want to try because all of these mods together + a world map will lead me to do something (i believe) will be epic. In the literal sense, not the &quot;lol epic xD&quot;"

Actually, here&#39;s a better idea:

Install Forge and the required APIs first into minecraft.JAR. Run Minecraft once to prepare Forge. Close it. Move your mods to the /mods folder (.minecraft/mods). Should have explained that part. Can&#39;t accept that Steam invite now to talk as I can&#39;t run Steam (it won&#39;t let me)."

BuildCraft. Doesn&#39;t require a knowledge of Redstone, but a similar, three-dimensional form of it called pipes. Use with Railcraft, Forestry, ExtraBees, and the required (for your sake) Thermal Expansion.</span>

That&#39;s one mod of FTB.

Honestly, if you don&#39;t want something as cluttered as FTB, I&#39;d recommend a setup somewhat like:

Forge, Optifine in the JAR
CodeChickenCore and NEI in coremods
Redpower2 (all modules), Thaumcraft 3, ExtraBiomesXL, Buildcraft, Railcraft, Forestry, Thermal Expansion, your choice of Rei&#39;s or Zan&#39;s minimap (recommend Zan&#39;s), maybe ExtraBees and Thaumic Bees in mods

That&#39;s a very well-rounded set of mods that [i]in my opinion[/i] provides a similar experience to a larger modpack without being quite so cluttered or full of confusing duplicate functionality or game-breakingly powerful gear like the Quantum Suit.

The main omission from this set compared to other modpacks is IndustrialCraft 2. A lot of IC2 functionality is replicated in Redpower2 and Thermal Expansion, but with more interesting mechanics and/or more polish. Including IC2 as well just gives you a third power system to work with (Blutricity, Buildcraft Mechanical Power and IC2 EU systems) and a hell of a lot of unpolished looking stuff with overly complex and rarely sensible crafting recipes. I don&#39;t miss it at all.


But, if you also don&#39;t want to do custom mod installs (which, yes, can be a pain; I recommend [url=http://forkk.net/MultiMC4]MultiMC[/url] as usual for these, managing mods in your Minecraft instances is extremely easy and I&#39;ve never encountered any issues with its automated mod installing) then booting up an FTB pack isn&#39;t really all that scary. Just remember: NEI is your friend. Need to know how to craft something? Search for it by name, R for recipes. Wondering what the fuck this thing you picked up is for? U for usage. Those two keys alone will save you a thousand wiki trips - in fact, I managed to progress through the tech tree of the Direwolf20 pack from start to finish without checking wikis at all, simply by using NEI for recipes and experimenting to see how things work. Many explosions were had, and it was actually really fun because I was in the game and focused on it and not really worrying about doing things &quot;right&quot;. Could not recommend doing this more :V"

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Manibogi;39684842]That&#39;s basically FTB :v:

Use DivineRPG... OH NO NO NO, disregard that, I forgot it sucked.[/QUOTE]
 
That&#39;s one mod of FTB.

Honestly, if you don&#39;t want something as cluttered as FTB, I&#39;d recommend a setup somewhat like:

Forge, Optifine in the JAR
CodeChickenCore and NEI in coremods
Redpower2 (all modules), Thaumcraft 3, ExtraBiomesXL, Buildcraft, Railcraft, Forestry, Thermal Expansion, your choice of Rei&#39;s or Zan&#39;s minimap (recommend Zan&#39;s), maybe ExtraBees and Thaumic Bees in mods

That&#39;s a very well-rounded set of mods that [i]in my opinion[/i] provides a similar experience to a larger modpack without being quite so cluttered or full of confusing duplicate functionality or game-breakingly powerful gear like the Quantum Suit.

The main omission from this set compared to other modpacks is IndustrialCraft 2. A lot of IC2 functionality is replicated in Redpower2 and Thermal Expansion, but with more interesting mechanics and/or more polish. Including IC2 as well just gives you a third power system to work with (Blutricity, Buildcraft Mechanical Power and IC2 EU systems) and a hell of a lot of unpolished looking stuff with overly complex and rarely sensible crafting recipes. I don&#39;t miss it at all.


But, if you also don&#39;t want to do custom mod installs (which, yes, can be a pain; I recommend [url=http://forkk.net/MultiMC4]MultiMC[/url] as usual for these, managing mods in your Minecraft instances is extremely easy and I&#39;ve never encountered any issues with its automated mod installing) then booting up an FTB pack isn&#39;t really all that scary. Just remember: NEI is your friend. Need to know how to craft something? Search for it by name, R for recipes. Wondering what the fuck this thing you picked up is for? U for usage. Those two keys alone will save you a thousand wiki trips - in fact, I managed to progress through the tech tree of the Direwolf20 pack from start to finish without checking wikis at all, simply by using NEI for recipes and experimenting to see how things work. Many explosions were had, and it was actually really fun because I was in the game and focused on it and not really worrying about doing things &quot;right&quot;. Could not recommend doing this more :V</span>
