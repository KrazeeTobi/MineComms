Like I&#39;ve said before, that&#39;s the beauty of Minecraft; you make your own fun in this worldly sandbox. Personally I&#39;ve still been working on my giant sandstone pyramid, but now I&#39;ve been thinking about adding a bit more fortification to Stonewall Village, perhaps constructing a large castle behind it. No wait, scratch that, it shall be a Wizard&#39;s Spire; a vertical fortress in which I can conduct arcane experiments and help improve the lives of the villagers!

Once 1.5 is released, I&#39;ll probably even add a new Portal to the Wizard&#39;s Tower, as well as the Pyramid, in the hopes of building a sort of &quot;Webway&quot; to connect my various holdings; I already have a Portal in a smaller tower near Redwood Canopy, at the edge of the swamp near the eastern deserts, so with luck I could construct the Webway without too many complications. But sadly we can&#39;t craft Webs yet, so I wouldn&#39;t be able to add that &quot;webby&quot; quality to the Webway, though perhaps a patterning of yellow and blue could make it seem to have kind of an Eldar-esque aesthetic to it.

That&#39;s another example of making one&#39;s own fun; role-playing the character you imagine Steve to be, and imagining the backstory of this strange twisted world. To me, Steve is the Lost Wizard of Technology, the last living human in the world of Minecraftia, cast across the seas of time in an effort to escape the zombie apocalypse that was annihilating his race. He was also born with the soul of a Reaper, an ancient soul-devouring creature that could use it&#39;s abundant spiritual essences to cheat death endlessly. After making his home in the jungle where he first entered the feral untamed future, he sought to find the remnants of his former culture, which he found in the Testificatum; a race of homonculi that were once servants of humanity. The simple farming settlement he found would become the village of Stonewall, which in time would expand and become the capital city of a new civilisation, as well as the beating heart of the sheltered Webway network which connected the various provinces of his &quot;empire&quot;."

start at spawn, preferably by the sea

travel 1 in-game day in a random direction, where ever i end up at mid day (proving it&#39;s on land)
this shall be the town which will be bigger than the village
link the starting village with this new town by a gravel path
next-
travel 2 in-game days in same direction i was heading originally
where ever i end up at mid day again, this shall be the HUB CITY 
huge city that spits in four directions North, east, south, west.
from each of those roads travel like i did before, 2days for a town, then 1day for a village

He was also born with the soul of a Reaper, an ancient soul-devouring creature that could use it&#39;s abundant spiritual essences to cheat death endlessly. After making his home in the jungle where he first entered the feral untamed future, he sought to find the remnants of his former culture, which he found in the Testificatum; a race of homonculi that were once servants of humanity.

I lost the will for large projects after my world was wiped. I first made my base before farming, water physics, minecarts, the halloween update or boats. I had it in a sheer cliffside and it progressively got connected to a second base I created once minecarts came in. My carts went down to bedrock, up a tower then fell down right at land level before going up  the hill behind my base then right back down inside it. they later added new terrain gen so I built a long ass bridge across the local ocean and made a third base.
Things I remember that you may not: 
Lava at the bottom of the map that I used to light my tunnels.
The day that the lava was removed from the bedrock.
The day that slimes were added and my unlit bedrock level tunnel stayed somehow strangely devoid of slimes while everyone else complained about them everywhere.
Redstone being added.
Furnace carts being the best thing ever.

It always makes me sad when I think about it, it was lost when we formatted for windows 7.

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=01271;39331671]I lost the will for large projects after my world was wiped. I first made my base before farming, water physics, minecarts, the halloween update or boats. I had it in a sheer cliffside and it progressively got connected to a second base I created once minecarts came in. My carts went down to bedrock, up a tower then fell down right at land level before going up  the hill behind my base then right back down inside it. they later added new terrain gen so I built a long ass bridge across the local ocean and made a third base.
Things I remember that you may not: 
Lava at the bottom of the map that I used to light my tunnels.
The day that the lava was removed from the bedrock.
The day that slimes were added and my unlit bedrock level tunnel stayed somehow strangely devoid of slimes while everyone else complained about them everywhere.
Redstone being added.
Furnace carts being the best thing ever.

It always makes me sad when I think about it, it was lost when we formatted for windows 7.

 I feel the same. Maybe it&#39;s the nostalgia talking, but Minecraft today just isn&#39;t the same as it was two years ago. Back then, the updates were coming fairly often, packed with exciting new features and ideas. Megathreads were filled with bug reports, discussion about the latest update, and the all-too-often complaint of &#39;a creeper fell down from above and blew me up!&#39;.
Every world had its own little gems, and even the smallest caves were packed with danger and excitement. The best constructions weren&#39;t meant to look pretty, but instead preferred functionality, leaving the imagination to fill in the gaps. Every diamond found was a treasure, regarded as a miracle by its astounded founder.

Nowadays, Minecraft isn&#39;t the same. A huge pile of mods are required to squeeze out even the smallest enjoyment out of a game that was once devoured for its simplicity and openness. No matter what, every world feels the same, with no unique or fascinating lands in sight. Caves are bare, unremarkable husks that are stripped clean and left untouched after being stripped of every single mineral, or completely neglected in preference for abandoned mineshafts. The excitement and wonder of an upcoming update is completely obliterated, as the latest snapshot is only a few clicks away.

It&#39;s sad, because I was enthralled with Minecraft during the summer of 2011. Nowadays, I hesitate to even start it up.
I&#39;m planning on starting a new world, but in Beta 1.7.3, where my fondest memories are. It would be interesting to see how a public server would run if it was set up on such an old version.

Actually, it would be really neat if you could switch between map generation types via the World Type setting in today&#39;s Minecraft. The floating islands from Indev would be a really neat world to build your Nether Quartz mansion in."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=01271;39331671]I lost the will for large projects after my world was wiped. I first made my base before farming, water physics, minecarts, the halloween update or boats. I had it in a sheer cliffside and it progressively got connected to a second base I created once minecarts came in. My carts went down to bedrock, up a tower then fell down right at land level before going up  the hill behind my base then right back down inside it. they later added new terrain gen so I built a long ass bridge across the local ocean and made a third base.
Things I remember that you may not: 
Lava at the bottom of the map that I used to light my tunnels.
The day that the lava was removed from the bedrock.
The day that slimes were added and my unlit bedrock level tunnel stayed somehow strangely devoid of slimes while everyone else complained about them everywhere.
Redstone being added.
Furnace carts being the best thing ever.

Command blocks can be renamed, bonemeal works differently, mobs avoid minecart rails, dispensers can use bonemeal and activate TNT, and there&#39;s a scoreboard system.

Basically this; maybe my opinion is colored by having discovered skeleton dungeons wherever I start a new base and making XP grinders out of them, but I tend to end up with chests full of 64x bone stacks and enough bonemeal to last me a good long while as it stands.

[QUOTE=Cheshire_cat;39336726]I feel the same. Maybe it&#39;s the nostalgia talking, but Minecraft today just isn&#39;t the same as it was two years ago. Back then, the updates were coming fairly often, packed with exciting new features and ideas. Megathreads were filled with bug reports, discussion about the latest update, and the all-too-often complaint of &#39;a creeper fell down from above and blew me up!&#39;.
Every world had its own little gems, and even the smallest caves were packed with danger and excitement. The best constructions weren&#39;t meant to look pretty, but instead preferred functionality, leaving the imagination to fill in the gaps. Every diamond found was a treasure, regarded as a miracle by its astounded founder.

Nowadays, Minecraft isn&#39;t the same. A huge pile of mods are required to squeeze out even the smallest enjoyment out of a game that was once devoured for its simplicity and openness. No matter what, every world feels the same, with no unique or fascinating lands in sight. Caves are bare, unremarkable husks that are stripped clean and left untouched after being stripped of every single mineral, or completely neglected in preference for abandoned mineshafts. The excitement and wonder of an upcoming update is completely obliterated, as the latest snapshot is only a few clicks away.

It&#39;s sad, because I was enthralled with Minecraft during the summer of 2011. Nowadays, I hesitate to even start it up.
I&#39;m planning on starting a new world, but in Beta 1.7.3, where my fondest memories are. It would be interesting to see how a public server would run if it was set up on such an old version.

Actually, it would be really neat if you could switch between map generation types via the World Type setting in today&#39;s Minecraft. The floating islands from Indev would be a really neat world to build your Nether Quartz mansion in.[/QUOTE]
 
A few months ago I played beta 1.7.3 on an old computer I hadn&#39;t accessed in over a year, and the difference between then and now is immense. For as nostalgic as that version is, there is a hell of a lot I&#39;ve gotten used to in the newer versions, such as sprinting and proper shift-clicking and not-trampling crops and all sorts.

I do wish that they would have an option for the old terrain gen, but if that was there, would anyone use the current one at all? Would the old one have biomes like jungles and swamps?"

Tree farms can quickly grow to the point where trees are regrowing before you&#39;ve finished chopping down the last ones, and farms needn&#39;t really be actively maintained to the point of requiring bonemeal if you don&#39;t spend the entirety of your time sprinting and jumping - and even then, just make the farm bigger and you&#39;ll mostly do fine, and as such I generally find myself with chests full of bones. If i&#39;m playing with mods, I can fairly easily fill a Diamond chest entirely with a combination of bones and unused bonemeal that I forget I have when I turn more bones into bonemeal instead, and if you have the Soul Shards mod this can amplify greatly when attempting to create a Wither Skeleton farm in the overworld - or if you happen to find a skeleton dungeon which aren&#39;t exactly rare.

I do think 7 bonemeal for 1 wheat growth is a little excessive, though, perhaps it should apply a radial buff to farmland-grown crops, causing them to grow their current stage twice or even three times as fast, resetting when they do grow past that stage? Naturally, the crop you click on will still grow upwards, but not the 9(?) in the radial boost."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=ElectricSquid;39343904]Basically this; maybe my opinion is colored by having discovered skeleton dungeons wherever I start a new base and making XP grinders out of them, but I tend to end up with chests full of 64x bone stacks and enough bonemeal to last me a good long while as it stands.[/QUOTE]
 
Tree farms can quickly grow to the point where trees are regrowing before you&#39;ve finished chopping down the last ones, and farms needn&#39;t really be actively maintained to the point of requiring bonemeal if you don&#39;t spend the entirety of your time sprinting and jumping - and even then, just make the farm bigger and you&#39;ll mostly do fine, and as such I generally find myself with chests full of bones. If i&#39;m playing with mods, I can fairly easily fill a Diamond chest entirely with a combination of bones and unused bonemeal that I forget I have when I turn more bones into bonemeal instead, and if you have the Soul Shards mod this can amplify greatly when attempting to create a Wither Skeleton farm in the overworld - or if you happen to find a skeleton dungeon which aren&#39;t exactly rare.

I do think 7 bonemeal for 1 wheat growth is a little excessive, though, perhaps it should apply a radial buff to farmland-grown crops, causing them to grow their current stage twice or even three times as fast, resetting when they do grow past that stage? Naturally, the crop you click on will still grow upwards, but not the 9(?) in the radial boost.</span>
