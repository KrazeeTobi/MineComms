/infdev/&amp;#8217;s been updated with muuuuch faster lighting sky brightness recalculation than before, and actual working lights.

It also keeps a cyclic buffer of near chunks in memory, so it won&amp;#8217;t run out of memory when you walk for a long distance. But since it doesn&amp;#8217;t save anything to disk yet, you&amp;#8217;ll loose stuff you walk away from.

Next up is working entities and working disk caching of chunks![/quote]"

Apparently the new loading system only loads things within your field of vision. I built a really large tower and saw chunks loading really far in front of me, but when I turned around, the chunks only just started loading when I looked at them.

It makes Inf_Dev pretty seemless, along with reducing a lot of lag. All-in-all, infinite is actually a better system than finite it seems."

                            <span v-pre>Wow, the Inf_Dev is going along nicely. I can also place torches during dawn/dusk without black holes. I just hope I can also do that when mobs and other features are added.

Apparently the new loading system only loads things within your field of vision. I built a really large tower and saw chunks loading really far in front of me, but when I turned around, the chunks only just started loading when I looked at them.

It makes Inf_Dev pretty seemless, along with reducing a lot of lag. All-in-all, infinite is actually a better system than finite it seems.</span>

                        <postrender input="I just wrote this:

It was getting dark. I had to leave my mine and head for home. I had made it perhaps within 100 yards of my home when I heard a faint whisper. I stopped for a second and looked around, nothing was there. My pace increased from a walk to a slow jog. Eventually I reached the house and exhaled deeply, my mind now at ease.

No sooner than I entered the bedroom had I heard that noise again, but it was louder now. Had I forgotten to barricade the door? My eyes widened, glancing around the room. There, in the dark corner, stood the intruder. He approached me and torchlight cast upon him. He stood slightly taller than me on his 4 legs. Studying him more closely, I was horrified at the sight of his huge, green, blocky penis, Both now stood erect, ready for action. That horrible, HORRIBLE sound now louder than ever as he charged me with his throbbing member.

He was too quick for me, and that was made immediately apparent as I was pinned to the ground with legs spread. He stood over me now, savoring the moment. He caressed me and leaned in, licking then whispering into my ear, &quot;SSSSSsSsSSS.&quot;  I knew what was going to happen and prepared myself. That was of little use. He slammed into me over and over, his manhood tearing up my tight blocky ass. It seemed as if his dick was over 8 times the surface area of earth.

He doubled his speed with every thrust, his diamond pick tearing through my hole. He was spelunking my ass, and I could do nothing about it. I felt something expanding in me. His head. And it was about to run out of room and my ass was already having enough trouble accomodating his dick. I closed my eyes, which had already filled with tears, waiting for the inevitable. He hissed again, it was a deafining, ear-splitting sound.

&quot;sssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S!!&quot;

I let out a massive grunt. My asshole had exploded. Hot smoke filled the room. I lied there, for what I imagined was an eternity. I raised my head to look around. The intruder was nowhere to be found, but he had left my house in shambles. I gazed through a hole in the wall to find it was still dark out. My ears, though still ringing, heard something chilling; the whispers of countless others who had been waiting for their chance."

                            <span v-pre>I just wrote this:

It was getting dark. I had to leave my mine and head for home. I had made it perhaps within 100 yards of my home when I heard a faint whisper. I stopped for a second and looked around, nothing was there. My pace increased from a walk to a slow jog. Eventually I reached the house and exhaled deeply, my mind now at ease.

No sooner than I entered the bedroom had I heard that noise again, but it was louder now. Had I forgotten to barricade the door? My eyes widened, glancing around the room. There, in the dark corner, stood the intruder. He approached me and torchlight cast upon him. He stood slightly taller than me on his 4 legs. Studying him more closely, I was horrified at the sight of his huge, green, blocky penis, Both now stood erect, ready for action. That horrible, HORRIBLE sound now louder than ever as he charged me with his throbbing member.

He was too quick for me, and that was made immediately apparent as I was pinned to the ground with legs spread. He stood over me now, savoring the moment. He caressed me and leaned in, licking then whispering into my ear, &quot;SSSSSsSsSSS.&quot;  I knew what was going to happen and prepared myself. That was of little use. He slammed into me over and over, his manhood tearing up my tight blocky ass. It seemed as if his dick was over 8 times the surface area of earth.

He doubled his speed with every thrust, his diamond pick tearing through my hole. He was spelunking my ass, and I could do nothing about it. I felt something expanding in me. His head. And it was about to run out of room and my ass was already having enough trouble accomodating his dick. I closed my eyes, which had already filled with tears, waiting for the inevitable. He hissed again, it was a deafining, ear-splitting sound.

&quot;sssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S!!&quot;

I let out a massive grunt. My asshole had exploded. Hot smoke filled the room. I lied there, for what I imagined was an eternity. I raised my head to look around. The intruder was nowhere to be found, but he had left my house in shambles. I gazed through a hole in the wall to find it was still dark out. My ears, though still ringing, heard something chilling; the whispers of countless others who had been waiting for their chance.</span>

As I was optimizing and fixing bugs today, I found a few places where I was still using 32 bit floats instead of 64 bit floats. As a result of fixing this, the maximum surface area in Minecraft is now 4096 million square kilometers, or about eight times the surface area of earth.

The optimizations (mostly as a break from the lighting, which I need to rewrite partially AGAIN) have been very fruitful. On the shortest fog (twice as long as the current shortest fog) I get 1200 fps on my main computer, and 80 fps on my Eee 901 PC. Please keep in mind that this is without caves and enemies, but it’s still a pretty massive improvement.

I will get an infdev update out this weekend.[/quote]

&quot;sssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S!!&quot;

I let out a massive grunt. My asshole had exploded. Hot smoke filled the room. I lied there, for what I imagined was an eternity. I raised my head to look around. The intruder was nowhere to be found, but he had left my house in shambles. I gazed through a hole in the wall to find it was still dark out. My ears, though still ringing, heard something chilling; the whispers of countless others who had been waiting for their chance.[/QUOTE]

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=SomeFaggot;20734560]I just wrote this:

It was getting dark. I had to leave my mine and head for home. I had made it perhaps within 100 yards of my home when I heard a faint whisper. I stopped for a second and looked around, nothing was there. My pace increased from a walk to a slow jog. Eventually I reached the house and exhaled deeply, my mind now at ease.

No sooner than I entered the bedroom had I heard that noise again, but it was louder now. Had I forgotten to barricade the door? My eyes widened, glancing around the room. There, in the dark corner, stood the intruder. He approached me and torchlight cast upon him. He stood slightly taller than me on his 4 legs. Studying him more closely, I was horrified at the sight of his huge, green, blocky penis, Both now stood erect, ready for action. That horrible, HORRIBLE sound now louder than ever as he charged me with his throbbing member.

He was too quick for me, and that was made immediately apparent as I was pinned to the ground with legs spread. He stood over me now, savoring the moment. He caressed me and leaned in, licking then whispering into my ear, &quot;SSSSSsSsSSS.&quot;  I knew what was going to happen and prepared myself. That was of little use. He slammed into me over and over, his manhood tearing up my tight blocky ass. It seemed as if his dick was over 8 times the surface area of earth.

He doubled his speed with every thrust, his diamond pick tearing through my hole. He was spelunking my ass, and I could do nothing about it. I felt something expanding in me. His head. And it was about to run out of room and my ass was already having enough trouble accomodating his dick. I closed my eyes, which had already filled with tears, waiting for the inevitable. He hissed again, it was a deafining, ear-splitting sound.

&quot;sssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S!!&quot;
