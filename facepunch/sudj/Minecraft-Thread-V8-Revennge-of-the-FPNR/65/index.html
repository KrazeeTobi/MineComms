I&#39;d say so, once I fix the RAM problems.

I&#39;d say so, once I fix the RAM problems.

(AKA I think I just fixed them)

Get on irc on espernet (irc.esper.net) and /query ^o^ (temporary name to piss some people off)

I think esper has a java client on their site.

I think the idea if you don&#39;t want to build the house yourself you should be able to pick from some sort of blueprint list and make a building that would take about a half of an ingame day to build and/or you can choose the same blueprint and place it above the house automatically reforming the house with an upstairs or put the blueprint next to it for the same idea but to the sides of the house.

Server Hosts will be able to make a map that everyone will start in a village of preset, the village will the center of the map, if on Infdev the village will be in a random location with near resources and food. Server Hosts will also be able to choose how long days are ingame with a 10min-4Hour limit. This would effect house blueprint building. Server Hosts will be able to set currency on or off, this will allow all players who join to start with 100 MineCoins, if disabled players will have to scavenge the lands for resources to trade with other players with what they think the correct amount is, Example:

4 Bread Loafs=1 Iron Sword or something of the likes.

I think the idea if you don&#39;t want to build the house yourself you should be able to pick from some sort of blueprint list and make a building that would take about a half of an ingame day to build and/or you can choose the same blueprint and place it above the house automatically reforming the house with an upstairs or put the blueprint next to it for the same idea but to the sides of the house.[/QUOTE]

What would you rather do? Build a house or have the resources to build one and have to stand atleast 2 blocks from the house and wait for half the ingame day for the house to build itself? Most people would probably choose Building the house themself, as would I, but for those people who really don&#39;t have the time to build their own personal house can sit there while they go get some coffee or something and have some lunch or however to come back to have their small little room built, this is only just a idea and I&#39;m in doubt of it ever being implemented. I was also thinking if you built a house you could save a blueprint of the house and send it to your friend so they can use it. It would ONLY be transferable around the one server though. Maybe while it is being built you are more open to get killed by creepers and have a smaller health portion to make it more of a survival fallback instead of a join the server and get a house in around 30 minutes to an hour sort of move.

Maybe if you had to do some sort of speedcraft minigame to have the house built where you have to choose the correct parts for a house, if you do it wrong the house is more vulnerable to other players and creepers when it is done being built, If the game is lost by making an incorrect choice 3 times, the house is only built 2 blocks high, and not allowing the player to build a house for another 3 minutes."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=DeandreT;21204026]What would you rather do? Build a house or have the resources to build one and have to stand atleast 2 blocks from the house and wait for half the ingame day for the house to build itself? Most people would probably choose Building the house themself, as would I, but for those people who really don&#39;t have the time to build their own personal house can sit there while they go get some coffee or something and have some lunch or however to come back to have their small little room built, this is only just a idea and I&#39;m in doubt of it ever being implemented. I was also thinking if you built a house you could save a blueprint of the house and send it to your friend so they can use it. It would ONLY be transferable around the one server though. Maybe while it is being built you are more open to get killed by creepers and have a smaller health portion to make it more of a survival fallback instead of a join the server and get a house in around 30 minutes to an hour sort of move.

Maybe if you had to do some sort of speedcraft minigame to have the house built where you have to choose the correct parts for a house, if you do it wrong the house is more vulnerable to other players and creepers when it is done being built, If the game is lost by making an incorrect choice 3 times, the house is only built 2 blocks high, and not allowing the player to build a house for another 3 minutes.[/QUOTE]

Notch doesn&#39;t need to waste time adding stupid shit. What is the point of playing when the playing part is done for you.</span>
