Lets say on the future [B]Multiplayer Infdev Survival[/B] version of the game, someone gets into [B]Farming[/B] and harvesting foods and wool from sheep, then they produce such a huge mass of [B]Materials[/B], they could open a self-built shop and accept Smelted Ore&#39;s as currency.

Imagine, running a pretty nice little factory, hiring people, paying them what you make in profit and also using your earned Ore&#39;s from selling stuff to make more tools for Farming etc.

This is going to be really interesting and I hope it develops into something much more deep and complex than &#39;hit blox, build shit, kill shit and move on&#39;.

Imagine, running a pretty nice little factory, hiring people, paying them what you make in profit and also using your earned Ore&#39;s from selling stuff to make more tools for Farming etc.

This is going to be really interesting and I hope it develops into something much more deep and complex than &#39;hit blox, build shit, kill shit and move on&#39;.

When Inf_Dev comes out, look for my statues.
I built this one in single player Inf_Dev,
Started the arms using dirt scaffolding-

I don&#39;t see how that could happen with practically infinite space, you can&#39;t build nearly as fast, and players will defend their creations.

And people will probably live in old structures and refurbish and add on to them

I disagree with you.
The key to keeping any multiplayer game fresh is to allow people to play multiple roles, and that&#39;ll be key to keeping multiplayer survival interesting.  Initially?  I&#39;d like everyone in the mines, some guarding, some digging, some running errands, everybody taking turns.  As a base is established, I&#39;d like to think people can fulfill multiple roles including building ad-hoc structures without being shoehorned into &quot;jobs&quot; or the like.

All I&#39;d really like to see is an outpost or ship on the borders of levels where gold can be traded for materials.  That&#39;s about it.

My logic is this: If there are griefers on Creative multiplayer, why wouldn&#39;t there be griefers on Survival MP? i mean, it would be EVEN EASIER for them to accomplish what they want: Fuck you over and piss you off, because now instead of ONLY building something awesome, you need to also fight for it and defend it. If they grief your base while you are away or even there, you&#39;re fucked; Get killed etc."
