Given the last few which introduced elements which caused massive graphical issues and proved how poorly he was prepared for fame.
 
He needs to sit down, and actually spend time on an update.  Nto just force something out for the masses on a friday.  Just sit and wait.  Good things take time.[/QUOTE]

What graphical issues? Only issues I know of were the server issues and yeah, he wasn&#39;t prepared for that. Yet it had nothing to do with the quality of the update.
Sitting down and forcing something out worked for the last 10 weeks.</span>

That was a pure quality update.  That forced out update which added absolutly nothing to the game.
 
Seriously, update where he adds items that are useless is kinda retarded.  We have eggs, milk, fishing rods, and slime balls.  We cant do a damn thing with any of them, so why do we need an update adding more items that have no purpose?"

Shit your right, I forgot Alpha is an excuse to let games have massive bugs which completely screw over some users. Damn. How could one be so silly.
 
May not be a full game, doesnt mean that he doesn&#39;t need to do some bug testing before releasing an update. If this was any other developer who had this issue, you&#39;d be jumping down their throats.
 
 
I want better updates. I dont want half assed code done during his lunch. I want a quality patch that isn&#39;t full of bugs, and glitches. I will gladly wait months for a patch thats actually full of content and fixes. I will wait with a smile on my face.
 
Secret friday updates are supposed to be fun, sure. But when the secret is &quot;You dont get to play, enjoy this grey screen&quot; Im less then enthralled with that kind of update.
