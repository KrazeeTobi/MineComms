Since there&#39;s infinite X and Y space I don&#39;t see why infinite Z space isn&#39;t possible. Just make the chunks as cubes instead of squares and have it not generate any land down (or up) until you get to that elevation. 

This&#39;d also allow for floating islands hundreds of metres in the sky.</span>

TF2 was my favourite multiplayer FPS game in 2007, then they added some things, I was okay with it. Then they added weapon upgrades... that&#39;s when it got out of hand.

Now the game is just fucking idling pricks and controversy over e-peens because you have a rare hat or all weapons.

I knew they were going to add trading once they started adding crafting.

I just wish they wouldn&#39;t have done that, because now I barley play anymore because all this stupid shit.

wile you have a good point there, most games today rely on dlc (just take a look at most mainstream games) and team fortress 2 strayed away from that releasing 137 free updates adding new weapons, hats, maps and new gamemodes

i think notch said there should be a backup folder somewhere in the saves&#39; folder if you can&#39;t find it google it. and one question, did you try to launch the save after the bsod if so you can&#39;t recover it 

pageking so i might as well help a nice guy with his server
