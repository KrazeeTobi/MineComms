Speaking of this, has notch said anything about wanting to add big monsters, like a dragon? Maybe varying in size, from about 2x the size of a creeper, to about 10x the size? Able to fly, and can breathe fire (that deals damage and sets fire to blocks it lands on) as well as use melee attacks. Also, it can survive in the day, and its main behavior is hunt/to kill/eat pigs/cows. It will attack the player and other animals at night, but in the daytime it retreats to a mountain lair (if notch ever adds monster villages), which contains many chests full of treasure (much like a dungeon)

I can picture it; As the sun sits on the horizon, bleeding a fading shade of orange, you see a silhouette in the distance. It drifts through the air, from here to there, occasionally landing on a mountain to survey the countryside. As it comes closer, you can see it terrorizing the animals of your farmstead; rending them limb from limb before devouring them. Its fiery breath lights your fields ablaze, sending billowing clouds of smoke into the fresh-born night. You go to your chest, and retrieve your  worn iron armor and sword. With these tools, your father protected his homeland from invaders. Now you too must take up the mantle of the warrior, and defend what you hold dear. 


You steel your resolve, and leave the relative safety of your home, facing the raging conflagration that was once your fields. The beast stands in the center of it all, distorted by the heat; appearing horrific and otherworldly. Entering the blaze, your vision begins to blur, and you lose your footing in one of the furrows. Face down in the baked earth, you are at the mercy of the dragon, who you can hear approaching. Thud, thud, thud, the heavy footsteps grow louder until they appear to be almost on top of you. A shadow draws over you, and the dragon prepares to make you into yet another scorched skeleton. Quickly, you turn, and blindly plunge your sword upward, piercing clean through both sides of the beast&#39;s mouth, sealing it shut.   The dragon rears back, up onto its two back legs, eyes wide. The gases that fuel the dragon&#39;s fire breath have been trapped in its sealed maw, but, in it&#39;s rage, the dragon still attempts to ignite them. However, as it is unable to release any of the considerable amount of pressurized fuel, the ignition only serves to cause an explosion, that vaporizes the monster&#39;s head entirely. The dragon&#39;s now headless body flails around hopelessly, before falling to the ground."

The beast stands in the center of it all, distorted by the heat; appearing horrific and otherworldly. Entering the blaze, your vision begins to blur, and you lose your footing in one of the furrows. Face down in the baked earth, you are at the mercy of the dragon, who you can hear approaching. Thud, thud, thud, the heavy footsteps grow louder until they appear to be almost on top of you. A shadow draws over you, and the dragon prepares to make you into yet another scorched skeleton. Quickly, you turn, and blindly plunge your sword upward, piercing clean through both sides of the beast&#39;s mouth, sealing it shut.   The dragon rears back, up onto its two back legs, eyes wide. The gases that fuel the dragon&#39;s fire breath have been trapped in its sealed maw, but, in it&#39;s rage, the dragon still attempts to ignite them. However, as it is unable to release any of the considerable amount of pressurized fuel, the ignition only serves to cause an explosion, that vaporizes the monster&#39;s head entirely. The dragon&#39;s now headless body flails around hopelessly, before falling to the ground.[/QUOTE]I bet that would drastically change the way players build their first home to survive the first night. It would be like that one film Reign of Fire, where the main method of survival would be to dig as deep as possible.</span>
