/places create &lt;name&gt; &lt;type&gt;
/places rename &lt;old&gt; &lt;new&gt;

/place &lt;name&gt;

All names will have to be unique now. This way people wont have to type in your name every time.

Also, when you create signs it will create a place for you if you put it in this format.

!name = personal place
@name = global place
#name = private place

Deleting the signs will delete the place."

a minecraft server barely uses over 70-90mb, let alone 1gb.[/quote]

AHAHAa 70-90 mb?! HAH /c

Like now, the map i have right now is probably massive, but i can&#39;t tell due to the google maps overview cache that is in the world maps folder making it like 5 GB, and the server is using 150mb with one person on, this might just be the leak acting up though."

a minecraft server barely uses over 70-90mb, let alone 1gb.[/quote]

AHAHAa 70-90 mb?! HAH /c

Like now, the map i have right now is probably massive, but i can&#39;t tell due to the google maps overview cache that is in the world maps folder making it like 5 GB, and the server is using 150mb with one person on, this might just be the leak acting up though.</span>

It&#39;s my unfinished treefarm! I&#39;m going to turn around and head back to the right this time.

Hmm? What&#39;s this door doing down here? Let&#39;s head down there.

Oh! This is my mini-warehouse! At the end, you can see the entrance to my super-cave.

These are the two main tunnels. But this isn&#39;t what I want to show you guys! Let&#39;s head back out and around.

My minecart tunnel. See mobs that can&#39;t get to you while carting around! Let&#39;s keep going and see what we find.

:iia:


I wish there were monster settlements, underground cities of creepers, skeletons, zombies and spiders, villages of goblins, abandoned castles guarded by monsters and dragons.

When I get bored of simply surviving, sometimes I want to sail off to a hostile island settled by intelligent versions of the current mobs with their own buildings and civilisations, and raid them for high-quality materials and items.[/QUOTE]

I agree with your post so much I quoted it for the next page.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=ProWaffle;25169653]Anyone read Diary of a Creeper?

:iia:


I wish there were monster settlements, underground cities of creepers, skeletons, zombies and spiders, villages of goblins, abandoned castles guarded by monsters and dragons.

When I get bored of simply surviving, sometimes I want to sail off to a hostile island settled by intelligent versions of the current mobs with their own buildings and civilisations, and raid them for high-quality materials and items.[/QUOTE]

I agree with your post so much I quoted it for the next page.

Checking out diary of a creeper now.</span>

Stone, grass, iron, etc, all looks the way it should.

However, the water and lava textures, *WHICH SHOULD LOOK VASTLY DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO TERRAIN.PNG*, have not changed. They are still the default textures. I&#39;ve compared the way I installed my textures with the way Doku&#39;s RPG pack installs and I don&#39;t see anything I&#39;ve missed.

I spent an hour in Photoshop making a custom texture pack using a 16x16 version of Doku&#39;s RPG texture pack, Painterly,and Browncraft textures. The main thing I wanted from Doku was the water texture to complement the Browncraft lava texture. After testing this, I can confirm that all of my block textures work fine. Stone, grass, iron, etc, all looks the way it should.

However, the water and lava textures, *WHICH SHOULD LOOK VASTLY DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO TERRAIN.PNG*, have not changed. They are still the default textures. I&#39;ve compared the way I installed my textures with the way Doku&#39;s RPG pack installs and I don&#39;t see anything I&#39;ve missed. 

Has anyone else had this problem?[/QUOTE]

Don&#39;t know exactly why this happens, but when the textures resolution is the default, it uses default liquids. But if it is higher, it uses the new liquids at a cost, no animations.

Although I knew they could, it would be better if you didn&#39;t directly link to the image.


Also, feedback of any kind... From anyone?

If I get no feedback then I will take it that it means it&#39;s perfectly fine and to continue with what I have.


After I get my youtube page complete ( it looked like shit, that&#39;s why I really want to pretty it up. ) I will start some wallpapers, but you guys, the end users, will need to tell me what you want. if you want a specialized wallpaper for you, please tell me exactly how you would like it and what resolutions.

Yeah, I can understand that. I am also a bit disappointed in the amount of updates now, but that is just because we are spoiled by this point. Bugfixes and stuff plus fun Friday updates? No other dev does that. But when people start to make shit up about him being an asshole because he now earns money, how he doesn&#39;t care about the game anymore since he earns enough now anyway... that is just stupid, and I don&#39;t like stupid behaviour.

Oh well, on another note: I tried the Overviewer thingy, but couldn&#39;t get it to work. Installed all the Python stuff, but the screen just disappears as soon as I start it. Managed to grab a partially transparent screenshot of it, and it seems it loads normal. Saw text about &quot;These are the saves we found&quot; etc. :/"
