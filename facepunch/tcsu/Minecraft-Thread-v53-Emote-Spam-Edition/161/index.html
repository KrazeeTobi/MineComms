Sadly, most of the people I kill end up whining about it, saying it breaks the rules on a PvP server. When I lose, I usually tell them they are a good shot or appraise their strategy, unless it was a cheap kill, like when they spawnkill me over and over.

Getting minerals and ores and working yourself up to a full set of iron armor, diamond sword, bow, and a stack of arrows never gets old, and the satisfaction of creating a successful, creative ambush on an unsuspecting target just gives me that rush of adrenaline. 

Sadly, most of the people I kill end up whining about it, saying it breaks the rules on a PvP server. When I lose, I usually tell them they are a good shot or appraise their strategy, unless it was a cheap kill, like when they spawnkill me over and over.

The key to minecraft is SMART combat. I can&#39;t stress this enough. I&#39;m thinking of writing a guide on useful PvP tips, anyways. Anyone interested?[/QUOTE]
 
Reminds me of a trick I used once, somebody was hunting me with a diamond sword, I made a tiny cobble wall so he could not see me, dug a hole in the ground and went digging forward, ending up behind him, while he was still trying to remove the little wall."

Forgot to mention, I am currently have a 5:0 kill:death ratio on Nerdy&#39;s server, but I attribute that to the fact that I have a massive fortress on the water and mining operations underneath, and never really leave it except when I have the urge to PvP. When I want to kill, I just head over to the spawn and look around for people. In one case, I asked some guy I was friends with on the server about if he knew of any people around the spawn to kill, and he told me who. That person was warned, yet made the stupid mistake of sitting in his house, with his back to the wall closest to me, making something on a crafting bench. Hit him a couple times with arrows, and ran around the house, catching him from behind as he investigated where I shot through."

Now that&#39;s a great trick.

I specialize in environmental warfare, doing a lot like you did, using the environment to the advantage. For example, three of my kills were in a cave, where the person started looking deep down in the cave for me, when I was in the main, first cavern behind a wall, sneaking. He walked right up, past me, and I critically damaged him with a stone sword. He made pursuit, and I doubled up on him by going into a cave room that looked a lot like this:

[img_thumb]http://gyazo.com/abb6fdc8fb8c8af18bcf98cbfeab5cd6.png[/img_thumb]

The oldest trick in the book, and I caught him in it. He chased me to the area with the green arrow, and I hid in the alcove where the green arrow was pointing. Once he ran past me, I was the one chasing him and successfully killed him with my simple stone sword.
