[b]TNT Enabled[/b]

[b]Rules[/b]
1. Admins are always right. Listen to them.
2. No harassing players. This means don&#39;t camp them 24/7. You will be banned for this.
3. Anything can be stolen if it is not protected.
4. Anything can be destroyed out in the wasteland. Except by lava and water. Use of water or lava will to destory something will get you banned.
5. No building within 100 blocks of a guild town and the spawn
6. No stupid buildings. (Ex. Penises, Nerd poles, Pixel art) Try to keep it a medieval theme. Or to a guild theme.
7. Anything goes in the wasteland that does not conflict with the above rules. (The wasteland is anything besides the spawn and protected towns.)
8. By entering the server you are agreeing that you have read the rules and understand them. You also agree that you know that if you break one of these rules you might be banned.

[b]Guild Towns:[/b]
If you and a group of people want a guild town protected then ask an admin when they are online. 

[b]Requirements for a town:[/b]
1. The guild leader must ask the admin for a town.
2. The guild must have at least 3 or more people in the guild.
3. Only one guild town per guild. 

[b]Things to keep in mind:[/b]
TNT is allowed and can be used to destroy anything. So be on the look out for traps.
Chest can&#39;t be protected unless they are in a protected guild town. You must also be allowed to build in that protected area to protect your chest. So hide your stuff or it will get stolen.
This is a pure survival server. If you die don&#39;t cry and whine asking for your stuff back. Suck it up and play better.[/QUOTE]
 
I&#39;m just going to say that this is a great server. PvP, TNT, all that stuff. Great stuff. I would play, but I have some Oblivion to play.</span>
