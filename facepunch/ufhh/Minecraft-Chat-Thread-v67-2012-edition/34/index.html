No what I mean is something like....

There is a main town, which has been made by the original people. Plots are open for sale to build on, and there is something of a &quot;government&quot; to manage the town. A mayor and a few &quot;nobles&quot; would be the leaders of the group and they would help manage. There would also be a town &quot;watch&quot; to keep creepers out, making the town a safe haven. Outside the major town would be pretty much a free for all."

No what I mean is something like....

There is a main town, which has been made by the original people. Plots are open for sale to build on, and there is something of a &quot;government&quot; to manage the town. A mayor and a few &quot;nobles&quot; would be the leaders of the group and they would help manage. There would also be a town &quot;watch&quot; to keep creepers out, making the town a safe haven. Outside the major town would be pretty much a free for all.</span>

I think the Open Trail server has everything you&#39;re looking for. We have player made settlements which can gain advantages through cooperation as a community. We have a comprehensive completely player-based economy, which works great and encourages trade between players and cities and even the opening of shops (I&#39;ve even seen some people sell homes in prime locations :v:). While a town is being constructed it has no protection from mobs so players often elect a militia of some sort to protect them. Once the players accomplish certain &quot;Town Tasks&quot; (This can be anything from building a prison, to constructing a town Market) they gain benefits such as protection from mobs and TNT. The wild areas between established settlements are a complete free for all."

Get the Too Many Items mod. It has a feature to set it to morning/noon/evening/midnight so you can have perpetual day. It also has a feature to give you whatever items you want in any quantities but you can ignore that (and you can toggle the mod on and off with a single key so you don&#39;t get tempted every time you open your inventory)"

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Rammlied;34368607]Here, a sapling harvester. When the sapling grows it turns into a tree, the log conducts the redstone current along, pushing the logs out. Eventually the logs would collect at the end while the leaves decay producing saplings, eventually burning.

It wasn&#39;t until typing this that I discovered that since you have to place the saplings yourself it&#39;s more or less useless/inneficient. Oh well.[/QUOTE]
 
Imo the dispenser should work like the deployer in redpower.</span>

XP Farms are fairly simple depending on what mob you&#39;re using.
With cave spiders it takes a bit of work because to be efficient you just need to build a giant pit rather than a 1x1 tube, but it works basically the same because it just drops them. However because they&#39;re dropped when they spawn so their health will vary, and you need to use a stone sword to kill them, which isn&#39;t too much of a cost. Besides that, cave spiders spawn like crazy so it might yield the most experiance, Idunno.

Skeletons are probably the most simple, you can funnel them into a 1x1 tube, raise them up about 22-23 blocks, drop them in front of you and you can basically bunch them to death to get your XP. Some skeletons will take two hits, so you can use a sword if you want to, but it probably isn&#39;t worth it. However in most cases you will be dropping the skeleton within the dungeon check zone (When a monster spawner is about to spawn it will check the area for the mob to see if there is already enough), so you can put a piston at the tippy top and hold the skeletons out of the zone until you&#39;re ready to kill them.

Zombies work the same as skeletons, but there&#39;s no way to get them to 1-2 punches because of their &quot;Armor&quot;, so you have to use a sword. (I have the two combined because I got lucky, probably won&#39;t happen for you)

I don&#39;t recommend using a dark room because it will require you to use a bow, unless of course you use splash health potions, in which you could use on all of these traps. They work very well because otherwise if you were to leave your computer on all night to let the mobs save up, it would be far too laggy to kill them. With a splash potion you can kill most of them instanty, getting enough XP to get to level 50 in one go.

I have a neat idea; what if we got a bunch of people to pool their amazing main worlds into one thing, and someone MCedit&#39;s the highlights of the world into an island, and the all the players with their main world islands battle eachother with their resources and stuff they&#39;ve got with their worlds. Could be interesting."
