I agree that the pathfiding is too smart for zombies, but they shouldn&#39;t be able to break blocks.  Maybe be able to knock open a wooden door after it&#39;s hit several times(to give you enough warning of the zombies wanting to come in).  Creepers shouldn&#39;t be too smart either, they already have a devastating power, if they had brains and the power to explode I fear they&#39;d be able to destroy things too easily.  Skeletons and slimes should have a moderate intelligence.  Spiders, Endermen, and Blazes should be the smartest.

[B]Edit:[/B]

Actually here is my idea of how the AI should work:
&amp;#8226; Creepers should always try to run straight at you, because they want to blow you up, they can only doge small walls to get to you, can&#39;t navigate a maze.
&amp;#8226; Skeletons should try to stay several blocks away from you, so you&#39;d need to sprint at them or shoot them with your own arrows if you want to kill them, they&#39;re a bit smarter about walls, but will still try to only get into a shooting range, not get right up to you.
&amp;#8226; Spiders should always try to get behind you before they attack, and they should be smart enough to navigate a maze.  If you&#39;re already hitting them they&#39;ll just come right at you instead of being sneaky.
&amp;#8226; Zombies should scale their intelligence as more zombies are around.  So if there&#39;s 1 zombie it will be very dumb, but if there&#39;s say, 6 zombies near each other they can navigate a maze, sort of a collective intelligence.

I&#39;m not going to talk about the other mobs because I don&#39;t encounter them often."

I agree that the pathfiding is too smart for zombies, but they shouldn&#39;t be able to break blocks.  Maybe be able to knock open a wooden door after it&#39;s hit several times(to give you enough warning of the zombies wanting to come in).  Creepers shouldn&#39;t be too smart either, they already have a devastating power, if they had brains and the power to explode I fear they&#39;d be able to destroy things too easily.  Skeletons and slimes should have a moderate intelligence.  Spiders, Endermen, and Blazes should be the smartest.

[B]Edit:[/B]

Actually here is my idea of how the AI should work:
&amp;#8226; Creepers should always try to run straight at you, because they want to blow you up, they can only doge small walls to get to you, can&#39;t navigate a maze.
&amp;#8226; Skeletons should try to stay several blocks away from you, so you&#39;d need to sprint at them or shoot them with your own arrows if you want to kill them, they&#39;re a bit smarter about walls, but will still try to only get into a shooting range, not get right up to you.
&amp;#8226; Spiders should always try to get behind you before they attack, and they should be smart enough to navigate a maze.  If you&#39;re already hitting them they&#39;ll just come right at you instead of being sneaky.
&amp;#8226; Zombies should scale their intelligence as more zombies are around.  So if there&#39;s 1 zombie it will be very dumb, but if there&#39;s say, 6 zombies near each other they can navigate a maze, sort of a collective intelligence.

I&#39;m not going to talk about the other mobs because I don&#39;t encounter them often.</span>

Actually here is my idea of how the AI should work:
&amp;#8226; Creepers should always try to run straight at you, because they want to blow you up, they can only doge small walls to get to you, can&#39;t navigate a maze.
&amp;#8226; Skeletons should try to stay several blocks away from you, so you&#39;d need to sprint at them or shoot them with your own arrows if you want to kill them, they&#39;re a bit smarter about walls, but will still try to only get into a shooting range, not get right up to you.
&amp;#8226; Spiders should always try to get behind you before they attack, and they should be smart enough to navigate a maze.  If you&#39;re already hitting them they&#39;ll just come right at you instead of being sneaky.
&amp;#8226; Zombies should scale their intelligence as more zombies are around.  So if there&#39;s 1 zombie it will be very dumb, but if there&#39;s say, 6 zombies near each other they can navigate a maze, sort of a collective intelligence.

I&#39;m not going to talk about the other mobs because I don&#39;t encounter them often.[/QUOTE]
 
also, zombies should only really come to you if they detect you in a way apart from seeing (smell? hunger?)

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=CowThing;34308243]I agree that the pathfiding is too smart for zombies, but they shouldn&#39;t be able to break blocks.  Maybe be able to knock open a wooden door after it&#39;s hit several times(to give you enough warning of the zombies wanting to come in).  Creepers shouldn&#39;t be too smart either, they already have a devastating power, if they had brains and the power to explode I fear they&#39;d be able to destroy things too easily.  Skeletons and slimes should have a moderate intelligence.  Spiders, Endermen, and Blazes should be the smartest.

I think you&#39;re right by saying ALL mobs need basic path finding. They shouldn&#39;t be as easy to escape  as they are now.

If zombies were to gain some advantage it should be the ability to use certain tools and weapons. Ever heard of muscle memory? I think they would spawn in large packs of 10 or so zombies and the occasional ones will have armor and tools. Certain tools, like a pick, axe, or shovel, could break through certain blocks to reach you. Weapons and armor act like they do on the player, providing a damage boost and more protection from attacks.

Also, mobs should have biome-based skins. Maybe pigs in jungles and swamps could be dark boars and in deserts they could be lighter toned. In forests a chicken would instead be a duck and so on."
