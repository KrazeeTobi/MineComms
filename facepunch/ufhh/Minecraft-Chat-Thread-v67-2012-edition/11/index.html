But the thing is, his skin changes with mine. Check the first video I posted, that and the giant spaceman statue are my current skin. In the old videos, his skin is MY old one, the Creeper with headphones. If he just thought my skin was cool he&#39;d have taken the CURRENT one and stuck with it, but for some reason, he updates his when I update mine, like he&#39;s taking it right from the source, which is [url]www.minecraft.net/skin/Doomish.png[/url]. The problem with that is that he has to download it himself, and that means that SOMEHOW he either is playing on my account legitimately, or he has a shitload of time on his hands."

Maybe he saw you a really, really long time ago and never got over how cool he thought your skin was?[/QUOTE]
 
But the thing is, his skin changes with mine. Check the first video I posted, that and the giant spaceman statue are my current skin. In the old videos, his skin is MY old one, the Creeper with headphones. If he just thought my skin was cool he&#39;d have taken the CURRENT one and stuck with it, but for some reason, he updates his when I update mine, like he&#39;s taking it right from the source, which is [url]www.minecraft.net/skin/Doomish.png[/url]. The problem with that is that he has to download it himself, and that means that SOMEHOW he either is playing on my account legitimately, or he has a shitload of time on his hands.</span>

Yeah, I am. But someone had an idea that he&#39;s changing the name/skin via a server plugin, and given that he has his own server somehow, that would make sense. It still doesn&#39;t answer why he is impersonating me of all people, but oh well.

Yeah, but it won&#39;t automatically update. Once you click the link where you change the skin to theirs, you get the one they currently have, but not any they may have in the future.

Regardless, I looked it up, and there&#39;s a Bukkit plugin that lets you change your name if you have OP/Admin status. Again, since he has his own server, he can do that, and if the name is a legitimate name in the database as well, you get their skin too I guess.
