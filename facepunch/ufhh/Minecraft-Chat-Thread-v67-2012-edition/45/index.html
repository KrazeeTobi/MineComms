The endermen pick up blocks in the main world because they&#39;ve never seen such a thing before, they are all &quot;Holy shit what is this soft green stuff coming out the ground!&quot; and grab they start checking it out because the world they come from is so dark and bleak that when the come to our world they are so curious of everything they just want to take it back.

The end is basiclly just a big boss fight arena, i do think the dragon fight could be better though like if it had some kind of ranged attack.

I also hope we get overworld dragons that land."

It&#39;s a barren wasteland, and it makes sense.

The endermen pick up blocks in the main world because they&#39;ve never seen such a thing before, they are all &quot;Holy shit what is this soft green stuff coming out the ground!&quot; and grab they start checking it out because the world they come from is so dark and bleak that when the come to our world they are so curious of everything they just want to take it back.

The end is basiclly just a big boss fight arena, i do think the dragon fight could be better though like if it had some kind of ranged attack.

I also hope we get overworld dragons that land.[/QUOTE]

I&#39;ve always hated the End because of how there is no motivation to go there.  You have to kill shitloads of Endermen to get there, the only hostile mobs in the game that don&#39;t attack you look at them sideways.  Then you have to find some random-ass fortress that under normal circumstances you should never even know exists.  Then, you have to repair a broken portal to another dimension and kill a dragon that has not wronged you.  The whole quest is based around killing things that mean you no harm.  

Not to mention that the entire quest is not mentioned anywhere in the game.  The only way to know about it is to look it up and know about it outside of the game, which really takes you out of the game.  Plus the reward is really meager, since the exp you get is relatively useless if you&#39;ve already beaten the dragon.  

so to recap:

1. No means of knowing about the quest in the game. 
2. Quest centers around killing things that have not wronged you.
3. Reward is relatively useless.

The End should be covered in really shitty replicas of the overworld.  Like the Enderfolk really like the Overworld and try to bring it home but everything they bring back dies because they aren&#39;t doing anything correctly.

This is the main part of the cave. You can see all the sand that is from the ruins of Oblivion. The Imperial&#39;s only town. It was destroyed by a virus.

This is a large ruin. Legend says, Dwarfs built these ruins in the very early days of this cave. This mineshaft was cut off abruptly into a large web infested cave. It is rumored that some spawning eggs are located here. It was defeated just a few minutes ago by me, and CJ.
