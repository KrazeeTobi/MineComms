Or instead of OPs they just assign leaders, and a referee/rule keeper will give each faction a set amount of supplies (cobble, wood, etc) for them to start out with, and they have 5 minecraft/ one irl hour to set up a base with walls.
In addition, the OP/rule keeper will be somewhat of a game master, setting up easter eggs with supplies like TNT, flint and steal, armor, etc, along with traps and stuff, and maybe in certain situations turn the side of battle for one team or the other to keep things interesting.

We should really get this going."

                            <span v-pre>The OPs could have a referee make sure they don&#39;t spawn a bunch of diamonds.
Or instead of OPs they just assign leaders, and a referee/rule keeper will give each faction a set amount of supplies (cobble, wood, etc) for them to start out with, and they have 5 minecraft/ one irl hour to set up a base with walls.
In addition, the OP/rule keeper will be somewhat of a game master, setting up easter eggs with supplies like TNT, flint and steal, armor, etc, along with traps and stuff, and maybe in certain situations turn the side of battle for one team or the other to keep things interesting.

We should really get this going.</span>

I am just so busy with school nowadays and some of the new games that came out, I can&#39;t spare as much time playing minecraft and thinking of another nifty adventure to show you guys, not to mention I have the mandatory military service on my head as in this country every citizen has to serve the military, both males and females alike, so I have to divide my attention to so many things that I don&#39;t even get time to play a lot of minecraft as I used to.

Oh wow, I just noticed how cluttered my HUD has become in minecraft.

Maybe someone should start a farm like raptor did a while back :V[/QUOTE]

I am just so busy with school nowadays and some of the new games that came out, I can&#39;t spare as much time playing minecraft and thinking of another nifty adventure to show you guys, not to mention I have the mandatory military service on my head as in this country every citizen has to serve the military, both males and females alike, so I have to divide my attention to so many things that I don&#39;t even get time to play a lot of minecraft as I used to.

Oh wow, I just noticed how cluttered my HUD has become in minecraft.
