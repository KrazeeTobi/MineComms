                            <span v-pre>So today I had the luxury of having this group of 10 year olds Join my Server and attempt to grief us, and then DDOS us.

Long story Short, I subnet banned them all and DarkSoul made sure we didn&#39;t get ddos&#39;d(I rent from Elpishost)

Well apparently they have a Youtube Series about griefing. Here is their video.

Apparently when you banned some guy (i seriously cant remember his name) it brought the wrath of a bunch of ten year olds down on your server and &quot;by the time we get banned your spawn will be destroyed&quot;.

Whoops. I rolled back the destruction :(

Holy shit YES it looks perfect

Time to make an amazonian forest kingdom where unknowing tresspassers into the forest get turned into arrow-hedgehogs oozing blood.

Also,anyone else noticed that there are really low trees that are pretty much bushes?

I wonder if the new trees will have their own saplings so we can make our own megaforests.


That gives me another idea,what about making sapling-alloys of sorts?(You can&#39;t crossbreed trees IRL,can you?:v:)Combine a birch with a pine to get a pine tree with birch logs and leaves,or combine a pine tree with a forest Sequoia or w/e those will be and get a really tall and thick pine tree?

That would be so silly yet so cool
