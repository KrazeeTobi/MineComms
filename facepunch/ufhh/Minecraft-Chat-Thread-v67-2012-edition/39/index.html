The incredibly interesting part:  Repeated experiment with natural cave.  In this case, Zombie did follow me out and caught on fire, which it responded to by jumping in to the water near the cave&#39;s mouth, where it resumed chasing me.  It seemed as though the zombie knew there was water outside of the cave and jumped in to it because it figured it was worth the risk of a few moments of exposure to continue chasing me.  Zombie then waded across the water to a large tree in the jungle and is now chasing me under the available shade. 

Jon&#39;s a fucking madman, I tell you."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=The Calzone;34404684]Interesting thing in the new snapshot:  I made a small platform out of a zombie spawner, with a section shaded and a section unshaded.  The hostile zombie followed me to the edge of the shade and followed no further.

The incredibly interesting part:  Repeated experiment with natural cave.  In this case, Zombie did follow me out and caught on fire, which it responded to by jumping in to the water near the cave&#39;s mouth, where it resumed chasing me.  It seemed as though the zombie knew there was water outside of the cave and jumped in to it because it figured it was worth the risk of a few moments of exposure to continue chasing me.  Zombie then waded across the water to a large tree in the jungle and is now chasing me under the available shade.

Jesus, I can&#39;t imagine what snow golems could be capable of if they had even half that amount of intelligence. It&#39;d be nice if they would lure monsters [I]away[/I] from you/your house rather than just pelting snowballs at everything.</span>

I hope they do something with the testificates soon, they&#39;re only use to me is to use as decoration. I&#39;d hope that they&#39;re working on it atm, I&#39;d kinda like it if they finished their old stuff before starting new stuff.
Also, maybe an actual name for these things? I don&#39;t think they&#39;re actual name is testificate nor caveman squidward, so they should have a legitimate name.[/QUOTE]
 
I&#39;m sure they will be working on the villagers soon enough, maybe after the other mobs get a new AI.  Also they&#39;re called &quot;villagers&quot;.  &quot;Testificate&quot; was Notch testing how they&#39;d look with a name above their head."

Why does a ocelot turn into a kitty cat? why does a feral jungle cat turn into a house cat? Id rather a tamed Ocelot be a tamed ocelot, then if you breed two tamed ocelot, the offspring is a house cat. I dunno. Im betting money that its just a placeholder though[/QUOTE]

I really wish that people would some complaining about game features, and just deal with it. That&#39;s what got the damn Enderman nerfed so he can&#39;t pick up player made blocks."
