As wheat growing is random, it&#39;s hard to make timings for the purpose unless you go for a best case/worst case (depending on how you look at it) scenario.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/8a/MCWheatGrowth.jpg[/img]

You&#39;ll want a timer going for an hour for almost-100% probability that all the crop is fully grown. Although - as also indicated by the picture and the fact that it&#39;s random - you may only have to wait 10 minutes. If you don&#39;t care about that, never mind.

Since repeaters are 100 ms delay per level (400 ms max per repeater) then - indeed - you&#39;ll need an insane amount of repeaters for a one hour delay (9000 of them, to be exact).

What you can do is take a look at this. I don&#39;t remember how long of a delay this produces, but I think it&#39;s 10 minutes.

Also, I see what you&#39;re saying, but the idea is the output should [I]only[/I] yield 1 if [U]both[/U] inputs are 1.
Likewise [I]only[/I] yield 0 if [U]both[/U] inputs are 0.

A and B are inputs, O is output.
It&#39;s a bit hard to see but the wire running along the far right and then along the bottom is actually connected to input A

Hm. What you&#39;re saying sort of makes sense. I&#39;ll try.

[editline]1st February 2012[/editline]

[QUOTE=Samuka97;34492943]Since you guys are already talking about redstone, can someone help me out here? I&#39;ve recently been wanting to make an automatic farm. No, not one of those that you pull a lever and it releases water and you go down to pick it up. I mean something that waits the appropriate amount of time for a decent quantity of the wheat to grow, auto-triggers the pistons and after enough time passed, puts them back into place and all you have to do is replant.

I was thinking of doing it with a BUD switch and a binary counter, but that&#39;d take up too much space, so instead I thought, why not just use a really long timer? But I&#39;m not really sure how to make one. With repeaters, I&#39;d need way way [b]waay[/b] too many of them to make a long enough interval for the wheat to grow, and as for the de-spawning-item-on-a-pressure-plate trick, I&#39;m not exactly sure if it&#39;d be exactly a very reliable way.

tl;dr how make long timer, about the time wheat takes to grow[/QUOTE]
 
As wheat growing is random, it&#39;s hard to make timings for the purpose unless you go for a best case/worst case (depending on how you look at it) scenario.

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/8/8a/MCWheatGrowth.jpg[/img]

You&#39;ll want a timer going for an hour for almost-100% probability that all the crop is fully grown. Although - as also indicated by the picture and the fact that it&#39;s random - you may only have to wait 10 minutes. If you don&#39;t care about that, never mind.

Since repeaters are 100 ms delay per level (400 ms max per repeater) then - indeed - you&#39;ll need an insane amount of repeaters for a one hour delay (9000 of them, to be exact).

What you can do is take a look at this. I don&#39;t remember how long of a delay this produces, but I think it&#39;s 10 minutes.

Also, I see what you&#39;re saying, but the idea is the output should [I]only[/I] yield 1 if [U]both[/U] inputs are 1.
Likewise [I]only[/I] yield 0 if [U]both[/U] inputs are 0.

[QUOTE=ralle105;34479322]I came up with this
[t]http://i.imgur.com/lhHkD.png[/t]

A and B are inputs, O is output.
It&#39;s a bit hard to see but the wire running along the far right and then along the bottom is actually connected to input A

[editline]31st January 2012[/editline]

When it has gotten through the AND gate it acts as an OR gate until both inputs are off and it resets.[/QUOTE]
 
Alright I built your circuit, but I&#39;m having trouble seeing what you&#39;re doing behind here?

 Probably, but thing is that clocks are normally not very reliable. Sometimes they stop when leaving/reloading a chunk, stopping/restarting a server and so on. That&#39;s why I came up with the idea for the watermelon trick. But does anybody know where I can find information about how long it takes melon stems to grow?

[editline]a[/editline]

They have 7 growth stages like wheat, but if I give it slightly less light and take into consideration the extra time it takes to actually grow a melon, it might work out because that might just be the extra time some of the other, better lit crops take to grow.

[editline]a[/editline]

Oh wait, I found out that a pumpkin stem takes 10 to 30 minutes to grow, but then counting the time it takes to actually produce a pumpkin, that&#39;s enough to have half-ish of the farm grown?"
