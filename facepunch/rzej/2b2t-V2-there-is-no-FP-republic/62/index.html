I was notorious with the older people on the server and that&#39;s kinda why I didn&#39;t want to release the information because I haven&#39;t had the experiences with you guys.

Keep in mind that all of this is [I]before[/I] the server was down for weeks. This means that any material gathered were legitimately obtained.
All images are thumbed due to size, click to enlarge.

What you&#39;re about to see is documentation of about half of the bases I&#39;ve visited. Since, at the beginning, I wasn&#39;t very good at logging destinations, there&#39;s quite a bit missing. Some of it will be covered by part of the the internal Ownzone document of destinations I&#39;ve decided to leak, as well.

Many of the places didn&#39;t contain names or a name, so I&#39;ve just come up with some random name based on what the place looked like. I only have [I]very[/I] few before/after pictures because I&#39;ve had to move in and out at a pretty fast pace and therefore forgot it in the haste.

[B]So what am I doing now?[/B]
If you&#39;ve followed the thread you know Ownzone II was taken out by The Trinity, so we moved elsewhere to what is now known as Ownzone III. We will post pictures of the base once we complete the construction. Or a video. I don&#39;t know.

We have a vague idea where this Trinity is located and we&#39;re considering finding them, but honestly, we can&#39;t be assed. No hard feelings against The Trinity. They expertly erased Ownzone II and I&#39;m happy it wasn&#39;t some faggot raid with 20 TNT coming to blow our bedroom up and poke us in the chat for months afterwards.

I&#39;ve been taking a break from 2b2t the past few weeks due to being busy IRL but I&#39;ll definitely consider coming back.

For those of you who doesn&#39;t know, Ownzone is two people - me and someone else - and after 2b2t went back up, we&#39;ve gained a number of inters around the map that is 2b2t.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.
Trust no one.

Also romet/dlaor/whatever, if you&#39;re wondering who took out your base recently, it was me.[/QUOTE]

Well, nice to know Putzburg&#39;s interesting at least. Why&#39;s that?

It was an interesting project and actually one of the most successful ones. It was very funny that you gave me the coords without even asking who I am in-game, back when the public didn&#39;t know.

I wasn&#39;t the one to massacre the base. I only stole shit. I didn&#39;t leak any information, either. I have no idea who actually destroyed Putz.
