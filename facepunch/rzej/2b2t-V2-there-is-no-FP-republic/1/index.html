[release][B]What the shit?[/B]
Terminologically correct it is an [I]anarchy server[/I]. 2b2t is the [I]only[/I] server out there true to Minecraft&#39;s gamemode: survival. It&#39;s the only server not infested by idiot-cunt-kid admins fucking up the server with every Bukkit plugin out there. The server is completely vanilla with the exception of the Bukkit plugin NoCheat. There are no admins, no moderators, no OPs, no bans, no kicks, no punishment, no rules, no nothing. It&#39;s up to you to survive.
And that&#39;s why we like it.
People from all over the Internet has adventured (and is still adventuring): from Facepunch, /b/, /v/, Reddit, SA and even DeviantART.

We&#39;re all equally worthless on this server. Nobody cares if you are raped, your base is destroyed, your friends betray you and your shit is stolen.

If you&#39;re even more worthless and don&#39;t know what to do, type &quot;/rules&quot; and &quot;/guide&quot; on the server, it&#39;ll give you a friendly insight.

It&#39;s [B]2b2t.net[/B] to connect if you didn&#39;t know. There is no whitelist or website.
[/release]
[release][B]Things we do not care about[/B]
• You found ungriefed land X blocks away from spawn
• You found trees X blocks away from spawn
• There are no trees in an X blocks radius from spawn
• You found a small, shitty but intact base X blocks close to spawn
• Yes there are huge craters and the spawn look like hell, we all know

Feel free to add in[/release]
[release][B]Some common questions[/B] you may have if you are clueless
• [B]How do you get so much TNT?[/B]
[url]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Mob_Farm[/url]
• [B]Why are some people so rich?[/B]
Because they&#39;re cunts and used a duplicator exploit to duplicate blocks.
• [B]How do I stay safe?[/B]
By not being a complete and utter moron. You heard right - it&#39;s [I]that[/I] easy.
• [B]Can I join...[/B]
Nope.
• [B]Will the map ever reset?[/B]
&quot;Not unless notch forces me to&quot;
• [B]Has anyone ever been banned?[/B]
Nope. And nobody will.
[/release]
[release][B]Some server facts[/B]
The server is connected with a 100/100 mbit/s line. The server resides in Sweden.
[img]http://www.speedtest.net/result/1370980067.png[/img]
It&#39;s already running an SSD, it&#39;s not why it&#39;s lagging.

[U]The stats as of July 7th 2011:[/U]
[B]37856 unique players[/B] have connected.
World is [B]8 months old[/B].
World is [B]29.7 GB[/B].

Type &quot;/server&quot; in chat for updated information.
[/release]
[release][B]The server lags![/B]
Should the server be unstable you can thank the idiots who are exploiting and/or clogging the chunk generation queue. Flying doesn&#39;t lag the server, flying over ungenerated land does.
[/release]
[release][B]Kill on sight[/B] - because for some reason you need one
• [B]DesertFury13[/B]: For appearing to be decent while subtly ruining peoples&#39; shit from the inside and being overly, unnecessarily, knowingly dumb
• [B]Luke[/B] and [B]Mweorz[/B] (assumed to be the same person, but its debatable). Biggest fucking hackers in the whole server. They have pretty much caused the destruction every single FP base there is, they are pretty much a legend. Rumor has it that at 100,000 blocks from spawn they have a massive mansion made out of diamond blocks, all covered in obsidian. Someone posted a video of his base a long time ago in the old thread.
• [B]Glent [/B]- Leaked coordinates and helped destroy an FP base
• [B]Protocol7 [/B]- ???
• [B]Bennygun [/B]- Abuses TNT, has destroyed several FP bases
• [B]rage639 [/B]- Idiot, griefer
• [B]coolnow [/B]- ???
• [B]PimpMastaFlex [/B]- Destroyed CC base

[/release]
[release][B]Some final words[/B] - because you&#39;ll probably need them

Don&#39;t trust anyone in this thread saying they&#39;ll start a camp. 24 hours, give or take a few, it&#39;s already on its way to the history books because they are absolutely clueless and have no idea how to execute the plan properly or who to trust. 24 hours is a decent attempt.
Don&#39;t listen to all the new idiots on the server who think they know everything and are ~pro~, they even more worthless than you are. Don&#39;t let them suck you down to their level. 
Out of the almost forty thousand people who have been on the server, how many do you think persisted more than a few weeks? Almost none. That&#39;s because they&#39;re idiots. There are no room for idiots on 2b2t. 
It&#39;s all up to you though. Now you know.

You should probably know that I&#39;m Sequel on Minecraft. You probably know me as an asshole on 2b2t, but that&#39;s alright, I don&#39;t need to be nice on 2b2t. I will post some interesting information about me and 2b2t at some point, maybe, although it&#39;s not even funny any longer because the many old people on the server I&#39;ve had relations with are no longer with us.

[B]If you want every horror imaginable happening to you [U]very[/U] quickly, follow this guy&#39;s advice:[/B]

[release][B]The server lags![/B]
Should the server be unstable you can thank the idiots who are exploiting and/or clogging the chunk generation queue. Flying doesn&#39;t lag the server, flying over ungenerated land does.

[release][B]Kill on sight[/B] - because for some reason you need one
• [B]DesertFury13[/B]: For appearing to be decent while subtly ruining peoples&#39; shit from the inside and being overly, unnecessarily, knowingly dumb
• [B]Luke[/B] and [B]Mweorz[/B] (assumed to be the same person, but its debatable). Biggest fucking hackers in the whole server. They have pretty much caused the destruction every single FP base there is, they are pretty much a legend. Rumor has it that at 100,000 blocks from spawn they have a massive mansion made out of diamond blocks, all covered in obsidian. Someone posted a video of his base a long time ago in the old thread.
• [B]Glent [/B]- Leaked coordinates and helped destroy an FP base
• [B]Protocol7 [/B]- ???
• [B]Bennygun [/B]- Abuses TNT, has destroyed several FP bases
• [B]rage639 [/B]- Idiot, griefer
• [B]coolnow [/B]- ???
• [B]PimpMastaFlex [/B]- Destroyed CC base

[release][B]Some final words[/B] - because you&#39;ll probably need them

Don&#39;t trust anyone in this thread saying they&#39;ll start a camp. 24 hours, give or take a few, it&#39;s already on its way to the history books because they are absolutely clueless and have no idea how to execute the plan properly or who to trust. 24 hours is a decent attempt.
Don&#39;t listen to all the new idiots on the server who think they know everything and are ~pro~, they even more worthless than you are. Don&#39;t let them suck you down to their level. 
Out of the almost forty thousand people who have been on the server, how many do you think persisted more than a few weeks? Almost none. That&#39;s because they&#39;re idiots. There are no room for idiots on 2b2t. 
It&#39;s all up to you though. Now you know.

You should probably know that I&#39;m Sequel on Minecraft. You probably know me as an asshole on 2b2t, but that&#39;s alright, I don&#39;t need to be nice on 2b2t. I will post some interesting information about me and 2b2t at some point, maybe, although it&#39;s not even funny any longer because the many old people on the server I&#39;ve had relations with are no longer with us.

[B]If you want every horror imaginable happening to you [U]very[/U] quickly, follow this guy&#39;s advice:[/B]

You try to put down new people in the OP but if you don&#39;t know who those people are you must have started on this server today.

Luke and Mweorz are assumed to be the same person, but its debatable. Reason: Biggest fucking hackers in the whole server. They have pretty much caused the destruction every single FP base there is, they are pretty much a legend. Rumor has it that at 100,000 blocks from spawn they have a massive mansion made out of diamond blocks, all covered in obsidian. Someone posted a video of his base a long time ago in the old thread.

Luke and Mweorz are assumed to be the same person, but its debatable. Reason: Biggest fucking hackers in the whole server. They have pretty much caused the destruction every single FP base there is, they are pretty much a legend.
