It would be amazing if you would do this. You are offcially my favorite person in the world if you do. Also, in my opinion it would be nice to start a new map over.

 Well hey I might just do it. I&#39;ve got school in a bit so I&#39;ll start working on it when I get home.

That might be possible to do. Maybe once a week or so?

I don&#39;t think users can do that, and I doubt housemaster is going to give that out. It would be cool, but I don&#39;t see it happening, as much as I would even like it."

Also, in my opinion it would be nice to start a new map over. It would obviously get to be like the 2b2t world eventually, and making it get that way would be fun. Don&#39;t listen to people who say HURR THE MAP IS NEW NO FUN[/QUOTE]
 
 Well hey I might just do it. I&#39;ve got school in a bit so I&#39;ll start working on it when I get home.

[QUOTE=Zero-Point;31757973]Even better would be if it were somehow possible to have a time-lapse of the spawn area over the course of a few months or so.[/QUOTE]
 
That might be possible to do. Maybe once a week or so?

[QUOTE=lexus04;31761704]maybe it would make sense to copy over the 1024*1024 space around the spawn to the US server? I dunno if that&#39;s even possible but it would help the feel I guess[/QUOTE]
 
I don&#39;t think users can do that, and I doubt housemaster is going to give that out. It would be cool, but I don&#39;t see it happening, as much as I would even like it.</span>

If you pull that US 2b2t server off, you can suggest a sub-domain of 2b2t.net to be pointed to the IP of the server. Something like us.2b2t.net or whatever. That way you don&#39;t have to pay for a domain yourself, if you want one.

I&#39;ll give you the details later today. I&#39;ve already got the perfect domain for it, and it&#39;s not going to be expensive in any way. 3.99 a year really isn&#39;t a problem. Though I don&#39;t want to give it out just yet, because I know some ass hat would go buy it while I&#39;m gone. But it&#39;ll be just as easy to access, and easily distinguishable from 2b2t.net. And as for anything else, I&#39;ll PM you so that I don&#39;t clog up the thread.
