Insisted it was me leaking base coordinates on the bases that I haven&#39;t built anything in the new base, despite the fact I just logged on after being asleep and I&#39;m around 4000 blocks from the new base.

These idiots are unorganised assholes who still don&#39;t realise that they&#39;ve got a traitor among them and each time they move a new base, they&#39;ll still be there because the traitor is in the &#39;close-knit&#39; group.

Have fun being raided again and again you fucking newfags, how about you just leave the server and let the decent people play without your faggotry and whining filling up both this thread and the in-game chat."

Insisted it was me leaking base coordinates on the bases that I haven&#39;t built anything in the new base, despite the fact I just logged on after being asleep and I&#39;m around 4000 blocks from the new base.

These idiots are unorganised assholes who still don&#39;t realise that they&#39;ve got a traitor among them and each time they move a new base, they&#39;ll still be there because the traitor is in the &#39;close-knit&#39; group.

Have fun being raided again and again you fucking newfags, how about you just leave the server and let the decent people play without your faggotry and whining filling up both this thread and the in-game chat.</span>

I wasn&#39;t actually the one who leaked them in the first place, but once I started getting accused I&#39;m not going to be all nice about it, so I leaked them.

Also happened when you guys started blaming &#39;jellybaby&#39; or whatever his name was in base 10, you kicked him out and it turned out to be CreamoftheSlop and you guys got quickly TNT&#39;ed after.

It&#39;s funny because the only reason your shit survived is because I stayed there and killed him, saving Beefbars also.

I pointed out once before on the server that of the two people who seem to be like the official &quot;base leaders&quot; each time, one of them is likely the jackass who keeps making everyone move to a new location to start building a new base that will just be blown up or leaked or some shit again. 

To the people who know that they aren&#39;t leaking coordinates or sabotaging their own bases, move out and start building up secret bases/homes for yourself in decent locations. Follow pretty much exactly what FunnyBunny said and you&#39;re going to be a lot better off in the 2b2t world than if you stick with your current pack. 

To the idiot who&#39;s causing all this retarded drama just for the sake of having something to do at the expense of others&#39; time and interests, quit being a dick and find another group of idiots to drag around.


I&#39;ve been much better off when not having to deal with waiting for a set of coords to a base that will just be blown up before I get there, and finding supplies on my own to build my own little area on the server with a decent storage of redstone/iron/etc."

To the people who know that they aren&#39;t leaking coordinates or sabotaging their own bases, move out and start building up secret bases/homes for yourself in decent locations.

To the idiot who&#39;s causing all this retarded drama just for the sake of having something to do at the expense of others&#39; time and interests, quit being a dick and find another group of idiots to drag around.


I&#39;ve been much better off when not having to deal with waiting for a set of coords to a base that will just be blown up before I get there, and finding supplies on my own to build my own little area on the server with a decent storage of redstone/iron/etc.</span>

Yeah, I didn&#39;t really give much of a fuck and wasn&#39;t involved when shit went down as I was heading to my own base.

I built that base, but I knew not to bring too many valuables since it was destined to get doomed either way. I remember mike going back and forth between &quot;KILL CREAMOFTHESLOP NOW! IT WAS HIM!&quot; and &quot;KILL JELLYBABY NOW! HE DID IT!&quot; every two minutes."
