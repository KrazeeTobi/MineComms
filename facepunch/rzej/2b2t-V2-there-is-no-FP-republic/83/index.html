The map has been corrupt and every player&#39;s data has been deleted. And now from what I read the world becomes more and more unstable.

I&#39;m not saying that playing in an unstable world is a good thing.

Yeah that&#39;s the problem I can see. It&#39;ll be just a bland map when it first starts, and unless people start playing it, it won&#39;t change much. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking first, instead of having one up for a while, and then it going down because no one played it. Would rather not let anyone down like that."

Yeah that&#39;s the problem I can see. It&#39;ll be just a bland map when it first starts, and unless people start playing it, it won&#39;t change much. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking first, instead of having one up for a while, and then it going down because no one played it. Would rather not let anyone down like that.</span>

make a new one? I don&#39;t think so. It sounds like a good idea, but why doesn&#39;t everybody just go through the nether to like 500k or wherever there is a large space with no chunks yet. It will be like a new map, but still have all old stuff closer in.

make a permanent portal at spawn that takes really far out, pretty much equating to a new map.

Maybe you&#39;re just lucky. Pretty much everything I do lags a little bit. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one that experiences this, and I hope that there are enough people willing to start anew for a slightly better experience.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Pilgrim;31753688]Stuff about lag:
I hardly ever lag, and I&#39;m pretty much as far away from Sweden as you can get.

Map:
make a new one? I don&#39;t think so. It sounds like a good idea, but why doesn&#39;t everybody just go through the nether to like 500k or wherever there is a large space with no chunks yet. It will be like a new map, but still have all old stuff closer in.
 
Other idea, but stupid because it requires plugins:
make a permanent portal at spawn that takes really far out, pretty much equating to a new map.

What I&#39;m probably going to do is resource gather until 1.8, then make a long tunnel in the nether and play it from there. Hopefully, there will be a period when flyhacks work, and I&#39;ll be able to get out there quicker.[/QUOTE]
 
Maybe you&#39;re just lucky. Pretty much everything I do lags a little bit. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one that experiences this, and I hope that there are enough people willing to start anew for a slightly better experience.

[QUOTE=Alan Ninja!;31754253]I&#39;d like a closer server, lag was killing me the other day. If you start one, I&#39;ll gladly help you turn it into an apocalyptic wasteland.[/QUOTE]

Yeah this is exactly what I&#39;m talking about. I hate to inconvenience anyone from 2b2t, but I&#39;m hoping it will be worth it.</span>
