I must be suicidal being within 1,000 blocks of spawn. Been in this base for nearly a week and no one has touched it.

[editline]9th July 2011[/editline]

[QUOTE=AntonFTW;31006382]What the fuck, I made a small underground tree farm, after a while tree had grown but there was no leaves.
I walked closer to investigate, got stuck in the invisible leaves, rejoined, re-spawned in a lava cave above, died and lost about 30 diamond blocks + other important shit.[/QUOTE]

I was tree-farming underground as well, and I was surprised as well that there were no leaves. It also seemed laggy as fuck as well.

Also thanks to Paramud for the music disc, diamonds and stacks of iron ore &lt;3</span>

We moved after our base got destroyed. I get on now, both chests of supplies are gone. Our chosen location for a base is abandoned and not added onto at all.

There&#39;s a nether portal not far away, and then nothing.
If it was Polly, fuck you. If it wasn&#39;t, where the fuck did you go.[/QUOTE]

Isak...I moved the entrance to the base about 20 blocks away from the original one...I&#39;m there lol.

I just moved it because that cave with the lake in it was annoying and we&#39;d get to have a larger base if I moved it back to the room that has your bed in it.

Edit: I moved all the supplies down to the base so they&#39;d be more protected. I thought about leaving a sign with directions to get to the base, but I didn&#39;t want to risk someone else finding it. Whenever you&#39;re online I&#39;ll show you.

Edit 2: And I&#39;ll remind you that I pm&#39;d you multiple times last night on Steam asking you to come on 2b2t so I can show you where the new base is and you can see how I&#39;m coming along on it and you ignored me. Rather, you showed me a link to the new Youtube changes.

I just moved it because that cave with the lake in it was annoying and we&#39;d get to have a larger base if I moved it back to the room that has your bed in it.

Edit: I moved all the supplies down to the base so they&#39;d be more protected. I thought about leaving a sign with directions to get to the base, but I didn&#39;t want to risk someone else finding it. Whenever you&#39;re online I&#39;ll show you.

Edit 2: And I&#39;ll remind you that I pm&#39;d you multiple times last night on Steam asking you to come on 2b2t so I can show you where the new base is and you can see how I&#39;m coming along on it and you ignored me. Rather, you showed me a link to the new Youtube changes.

Now I&#39;d like an apology [img]http://sae.tweek.us/static/images/emoticons/emot-colbert.gif[/img][/QUOTE]

Sorry!
It&#39;s really well-hidden. I x-rayed around, looking for it, and all I saw was the nether portal so I assumed (blegh).

Good job :D"

If it were that simple. Thats what I though until I actually started basing with other people. You cant trust anyone. Just cause some facepuncher wants in doesn&#39;t mean he isn&#39;t gonna leak the coordinates or steal all your shit.

There is 3 people in my base that are friends of people in my base, everyone else is a facepuncher.
