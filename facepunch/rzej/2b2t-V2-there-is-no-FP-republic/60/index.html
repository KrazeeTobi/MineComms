                            <span v-pre>Here&#39;s a sum-up of 2b2t.net:

Newfags:

&quot;WHERE R DA TREES&quot;
&quot;THIS SERVER SUCKS&quot;
&quot;WHERE IS EVERYONE!&quot;

Regulars:

Is there anyone that I can team with?
So what ever happened to spawn?
Lets change 2b2t forever (fails afterwards)

Semi-Olds:

Used dupe glich for massive diamonds.
Hates newfags
Good chance they will betray people.

Olds:

&quot;Fuck Off&quot;
&quot;Screw You&quot;

I figured this person would be coming back sometime soon so I took off to the north and never looked back. I&#39;m a good 8K blocks out now and it looks pretty deserted as far as massive terrain damage. Still a shortage of trees though. I setup camp and got to crafting a set of Iron armor and some Diamond tools. Off to a great start and hopefully I don&#39;t die anytime soon. I kind of like the excitement of a survival server, never knowing when your going to be randomly stabbed in the back and have all your gear looted. Now if I could just figure out what the spawn point coordinates were.[/QUOTE]
