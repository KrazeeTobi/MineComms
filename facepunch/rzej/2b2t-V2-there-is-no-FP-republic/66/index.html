You think it&#39;s shit because it doesn&#39;t have a horde of 12-14 year-old admins constantly playing on the server to ban everyone placing one block wrongly, it doesn&#39;t have every Bukkit plugin for economy, clans, or whatever you have out there and it doesn&#39;t encourage a family-like community."
