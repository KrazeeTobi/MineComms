                        <postrender input="I put my stuff in my chest, equipped a full diamond kit and TNT. I set off towards spawn. About 2000 blocks from my home, I found two dungeons, very nearby each other (less than 10 blocks inbetween). I lagged like crazy and died. So, I remade the diamond kit and started going towards spawn when I found the dungeons again, with all my stuff lying around. I looted the four chests and escaped with two sets of diamond armour.

I found many bases, but there was only one that I griefed at all. The reason I was leaving to go to the spawn was to kill, after all. I found a small tunnel and went down it, this was around 1,500 blocks from spawn. Inside was a sign saying &quot;ABANDONED    have fun&quot;. However, it was not abandoned, as I found gold, iron, redstone and lapis in several chests. I first started getting more suspicious when I found a Trapdoor within one. But then I found a bookshelf inside someone&#39;s wooden room. And, of course, I found a switch. And, of course, the bookshelf opened. The bookshelf slid open to reveal a small cavern which I didn&#39;t bother to explore.

I noticed that the room&#39;s light was provided by lava, held back by glass. I remembered what my mission was; to hurt. So I smashed all the glass and allowed the scorching magma to flow onto the wooden planks, I smiled at the crackling sound of flames. I then placed a sign, which said something along the lines of &quot;Nice bookshelf, bro.  -TylerCB&quot;.

I found many, many hidden chests throughout that base, and the second floor was made of wood. I had buckets of lava, as well as my trusty Flint and Steel. I placed lava above every bed I found. I set fire to most of the wood, but allowed some pieces to remain unharmed, in order to provide a more damaged effect. I took everything that was valuable, I placed signs with my name everywhere, so my victims would know who caused the inferno.

Almost every room had lava in it, most of the wood had been burned, and I destroyed lots of their creations. I took their valuables, I ruined their hard work, I melted their homes. And I was proud of it.


I then found x0XP&#39;s older base, which was already very griefed and there was nothing of value to take. On my way to my destination I came across landmarks that I had previously encountered on my journey to my current home, Fort Eden. When I got within 600 blocks of the spawn, I found a wolf, which I tamed, my plan was to use him as a soldier in my twisted games. After walking some distance, I met my first three people. I cannot remember their names, but I killed them all.
All but one.
One attempted to escape, and so I chased after them. They had entered some form of cave with an open roof and they were trying to dig away from me. I started digging down, when I lagged horrible and disconnected. When I rejoined, I was suffocating and had to smash my diamond pickaxe at whatever I could reach. To my horror, I heard the yelps of my pet, and by the time I managed to dig my way out, my new-found companion was dead, killed by my own pick.

Blinded with rage, I rushed towards the entrance of the survivor&#39;s cave and place TNT, setting it alight with my Flint and Steel. The explosive block dropped, and the person simply stared in awe at me. I watched the TNT explode, I watched the crater appear, and I watched the person disappear, dropping nothing but a piece of Flint.

I continued on my travels, coming across many castles I had seen so many times before. Memories flooded back to me of how I had hid in these old, broken buildings, long ago. As I entered a small area of trees, I found three more wolves. I tamed them all, glad that I, once again, had partners. As we walked, we met the two people from earlier - the ones I killed first. They tried to escape me, but I cornered them. One of them offered me a gift, which was a Sapling. I was about to let him go when him attempted to insult me, and so me and my soldiers dispatched of him quickly and cleanly. His friend tried swimming away, but it was getting dark and he couldn&#39;t see my dark clothing lurking in the shadows of the water. I shot an arrow through his brain and pierced him with my diamond sword.

As night fell, I stood in the area in which my opponents died, waiting for the sun to rise. But the monsters had other plans. Me and my wolves defended our torch-lit beach, until one of my partners&#39; life ended by the explosion of a Creeper. I rushed away and hid in a castle, but it started to rain. I lagged and disconnected, and when I rejoined, skeletons were viciously murdering my friends. As I watched the life go out of my pets, I killed the skeletal archers and ran away. I recognized the area, it was an overhang. But one thing was different about it.

In the center of the floor, barely lit by the moonlight, there was an obsidian frame. Somebody had made a Nether portal, which had obviously failed and was no longer working. Monsters were everywhere, stumbling forwards from the darkness. I lit the portal, in the hopes that it will help a future human in the same situation as me, effectively saving their life. Standing on top of the Hell gate, I fought off swarms of the undead, until eventually my position was over-run and I had to retreat. I rushed towards a small, sandy hill. As I climbed it, I was met with a familiar site.

The destroyed crater that is the spawn.

I stood in amazement. When I first came to this land, I was a mere refugee attempting to find safety. But now, now I was an evil, diamond-wearing murderer. I was the monster. But you do what you must to survive, and the only way to survive here is at the death of others. I looked at what I was carrying. Gold, redstone, iron, things I had stolen from others, people who would never see them again. I was unstoppable, and as I stood there with my diamond armour and tools, I felt indestructible.

Then I heard a hiss and was killed by a motherfucking Creeper, and I respawned 8000 blocks away."

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=TCB;31029099]I put my stuff in my chest, equipped a full diamond kit and TNT. I set off towards spawn. About 2000 blocks from my home, I found two dungeons, very nearby each other (less than 10 blocks inbetween). I lagged like crazy and died. So, I remade the diamond kit and started going towards spawn when I found the dungeons again, with all my stuff lying around. I looted the four chests and escaped with two sets of diamond armour.

I found many bases, but there was only one that I griefed at all. The reason I was leaving to go to the spawn was to kill, after all. I found a small tunnel and went down it, this was around 1,500 blocks from spawn. Inside was a sign saying &quot;ABANDONED    have fun&quot;. However, it was not abandoned, as I found gold, iron, redstone and lapis in several chests. I first started getting more suspicious when I found a Trapdoor within one. But then I found a bookshelf inside someone&#39;s wooden room. And, of course, I found a switch. And, of course, the bookshelf opened. The bookshelf slid open to reveal a small cavern which I didn&#39;t bother to explore.

I noticed that the room&#39;s light was provided by lava, held back by glass. I remembered what my mission was; to hurt. So I smashed all the glass and allowed the scorching magma to flow onto the wooden planks, I smiled at the crackling sound of flames. I then placed a sign, which said something along the lines of &quot;Nice bookshelf, bro.  -TylerCB&quot;.

I found many, many hidden chests throughout that base, and the second floor was made of wood. I had buckets of lava, as well as my trusty Flint and Steel. I placed lava above every bed I found. I set fire to most of the wood, but allowed some pieces to remain unharmed, in order to provide a more damaged effect. I took everything that was valuable, I placed signs with my name everywhere, so my victims would know who caused the inferno.

Almost every room had lava in it, most of the wood had been burned, and I destroyed lots of their creations. I took their valuables, I ruined their hard work, I melted their homes. And I was proud of it.


I then found x0XP&#39;s older base, which was already very griefed and there was nothing of value to take. On my way to my destination I came across landmarks that I had previously encountered on my journey to my current home, Fort Eden. When I got within 600 blocks of the spawn, I found a wolf, which I tamed, my plan was to use him as a soldier in my twisted games. After walking some distance, I met my first three people. I cannot remember their names, but I killed them all.
All but one.
One attempted to escape, and so I chased after them. They had entered some form of cave with an open roof and they were trying to dig away from me. I started digging down, when I lagged horrible and disconnected. When I rejoined, I was suffocating and had to smash my diamond pickaxe at whatever I could reach. To my horror, I heard the yelps of my pet, and by the time I managed to dig my way out, my new-found companion was dead, killed by my own pick.

Blinded with rage, I rushed towards the entrance of the survivor&#39;s cave and place TNT, setting it alight with my Flint and Steel. The explosive block dropped, and the person simply stared in awe at me. I watched the TNT explode, I watched the crater appear, and I watched the person disappear, dropping nothing but a piece of Flint.

I continued on my travels, coming across many castles I had seen so many times before. Memories flooded back to me of how I had hid in these old, broken buildings, long ago. As I entered a small area of trees, I found three more wolves. I tamed them all, glad that I, once again, had partners. As we walked, we met the two people from earlier - the ones I killed first. They tried to escape me, but I cornered them. One of them offered me a gift, which was a Sapling. I was about to let him go when him attempted to insult me, and so me and my soldiers dispatched of him quickly and cleanly. His friend tried swimming away, but it was getting dark and he couldn&#39;t see my dark clothing lurking in the shadows of the water. I shot an arrow through his brain and pierced him with my diamond sword.

As night fell, I stood in the area in which my opponents died, waiting for the sun to rise. But the monsters had other plans. Me and my wolves defended our torch-lit beach, until one of my partners&#39; life ended by the explosion of a Creeper. I rushed away and hid in a castle, but it started to rain. I lagged and disconnected, and when I rejoined, skeletons were viciously murdering my friends. As I watched the life go out of my pets, I killed the skeletal archers and ran away. I recognized the area, it was an overhang. But one thing was different about it.

In the center of the floor, barely lit by the moonlight, there was an obsidian frame. Somebody had made a Nether portal, which had obviously failed and was no longer working. Monsters were everywhere, stumbling forwards from the darkness. I lit the portal, in the hopes that it will help a future human in the same situation as me, effectively saving their life. Standing on top of the Hell gate, I fought off swarms of the undead, until eventually my position was over-run and I had to retreat. I rushed towards a small, sandy hill. As I climbed it, I was met with a familiar site.

The destroyed crater that is the spawn.

I stood in amazement. When I first came to this land, I was a mere refugee attempting to find safety. But now, now I was an evil, diamond-wearing murderer. I was the monster. But you do what you must to survive, and the only way to survive here is at the death of others. I looked at what I was carrying. Gold, redstone, iron, things I had stolen from others, people who would never see them again. I was unstoppable, and as I stood there with my diamond armour and tools, I felt indestructible.

Then I heard a hiss and was killed by a motherfucking Creeper, and I respawned 8000 blocks away.[/QUOTE]

                            <span v-pre>I&#39;m making a small memorial to fallen bases in Polly and my base. (how do you even say that)

So far we&#39;ve got his two old forts, Maanalanien and Kekonnen, and some old FP bases (The Hub, CC Base, and Fort H&amp;S)

Any other (good) fallen bases that anyone wants me to put in here? A little cave doesn&#39;t count.</span>
