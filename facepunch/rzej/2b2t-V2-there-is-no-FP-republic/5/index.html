I would, but mods wouldn&#39;t be too happy about new threads.

[B]I will if I get more agrees than disagrees on this post. (Rate agree if you want me to make a new thread. Disagrees are saying I shouldn&#39;t.)[/B]</span>

I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re so mad. We&#39;re playing a game. At the moment I&#39;m exposing you because you&#39;re not learning. You don&#39;t want me to be the OP of the thread because of this.

Hi.
I didn&#39;t add him because I dislike him. I have nothing against him, why would I? I don&#39;t know the guy, but it&#39;s alright you believe I added him for that reason.
Anyway, the reason I&#39;m poking policemike is because he&#39;s insisting on duplicating items all the time, thus lagging the server with the 1-tick circuits. I [I]did[/I] try the nice approach, but it didn&#39;t work. I&#39;m not saying I didn&#39;t do anything, but he provoked it himself. You being a part of his stuff, whatever he&#39;s doing, is not my fault and I&#39;m deeply sorry if I ruined the game for you - it wasn&#39;t my intention. I am not sorry if I&#39;ve ruined the game for policemike, I&#39;m getting even with him by doing this.

Policemike removed from the KOS list."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=.Isak.;30977660]Sequel is the OP, inacio. One reason we want Chez to remake it - plus he&#39;s a nicer guy in general.

Sequel, the reason I&#39;d like to see mike taken off the KOS list is because he does not belong there.
Luke destroys bases. BennyGun too. Others have leaked coordinates.
You simply add him there because you personally dislike him and you don&#39;t think he can play the game how he wishes. So what if he and some of his friends are making bases together and moving several times daily? They enjoy it. Let them.

Sequel, for leaking coordinates in an above post, YOU should be on the KOS list. Leaking coords and griefing are why you should be on it, not moving bases several times a day.[/QUOTE]

Luke and Mweorz are assumed to be the same person, but its debatable. Reason: Biggest fucking hackers in the whole server. They have pretty much caused the destruction every single FP base there is, they are pretty much a legend.

Luke and Mweorz are assumed to be the same person, but its debatable. Reason: Biggest fucking hackers in the whole server. They have pretty much caused the destruction every single FP base there is, they are pretty much a legend.
