                        <postrender input="Might as well tell our side of the story too:
We had a small base on a beach about 1,000 blocks away from spawn. The base was simply a stairway leading into a small square room with some chests and beds. Someone, I can&#39;t remember whether it was toothycat or godilla101, reported that two people in diamond just got into the stairway. They killed us all, and me and chaoslink kept respawning in the beds, and after being spawn killed trying to attack them, chaos managed to kill one of them, original_ganker. The other guy, kstalawl, broke our beds and sent us back to spawn. When we were preparing for revenge, we met up with another guy, chancejones7, who gave us a huge amount of help along the way. When we finally got back to the base, we looked around and found nothing, and continued on, with no sign of the raiders. Eventually, nightfall came, and me, chaos, toothycat, and godilla101 made a small dirt hut in a nearby desert. Godilla101 spotted a nameplate in the distance, kstalawl. A few seconds later, another one showed up, though we couldn&#39;t make out the name.

We followed the nameplates, and dug down into the furnace wall of funnybunny&#39;s base.

[img]http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/4750/baseisinvade.png[/img]

Chaos found a ton of diamond stored in one of the furnaces, and kstalawl spotted us. He spammed TNT everywhere around us, but he didn&#39;e detonate it. I had some redstone torches on me, so I ignited the TNT, and the main room became a huge mess of lava. Outside, chaoslink crafted me diamond armor and a sword. Kstalawl came running out of the base, and I killed him pretty easily. We went back into the base, and met up with toothycat, who entered from another location. I went down into the duping room, and Original_ganker was standing there doing nothing, I killed him and stole all of his TNT. Toothycat was running around in the huge hole to bedrock, being chased by parcec(funnybunny). He disappeared as I was chasing him(This was before the log in/out messages were removed).

We finished stealing everything of value and blew up the place. After spending the night in the great wall nearby, we caught parcec running away in the desert. We managed to hit him once, but he ended up logging out. We spent the next couple hours at the desert, waiting for him to come back. We built a dirt house nearby with a bed and crafting table. We also met back up with chance and gave him some of our loot. Kstalawl came running back through the area a few times. The first time he came back, we chased him around with diamond swords until on a rainy night we had him up against a corner in an old cobblestone house. We made fun of him and asked him some questions. He gave us details on his base, told us how he didn&#39;t know parcec, and said that he raided our base because we were too close to his. 

After a while, we all agreed that parcec wasn’t coming back any time soon, and camping there was a complete waste. We went thousands of blocks away, and at one point, godilla went to sleep. We went another few thousand blocks out and made a small house in a cave. At this point, parcec started messaging us, and made up a story of how kstalawl and original_ganker were intruders to his base. Me and chaos believed this, though toothycat and godilla101 were suspicious from the start. He came over to our house, and we talked a bit and logged off. We continued on to make a new base at bedrock, which we stayed at for 4 days.  Over this time, we noticed a stack of diamond and logs missing. There was also some other guy in the area who messed with our nether portal in a cave nearby and placed signs about how he is going to find our base in an ice ocean nearby. His name was animefan9. A few days passed, everyone got bored and went off to play some other games. After playing an hour or two of TF2, toothycat logged back in to find that our entire base was gone. I went down and found kstalawl, and we also killed some other guy, his name was something dictator. I searched through what was once our base, and found a nice poem:

ROSES ARE RED
VIOLETS ARE BLUE
DON’T FUCK WITH ME
SIGNED, FUNNYBUNNY

I went back upstairs and saw enigma937. I killed him, and holyshiz logged on since he had our only diamond left. He was running around when he casually told us that someone was shooting him with arrows. That guy turned out to be parcec. We all went back downstairs to find him still there. He vanished, and while I was trying to find this tunnel he told me about, chaoslink and toothycat were telling me to just get the hell out of there, because we assumed the coords were leaked, since we didn&#39;t know who all these other inruders were. Eventually, they started to leave without me, so I quit the search and joined them."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=flyboy463;31259625]Just started out on this server, was a nice change of pace from single player. Pretty much died a few times at spawn, looked for trees for a few thousand blocks, found one, cut it, then proceeded to build a base in a mountainside.

While building my what was going to be tree farm some guy (sorry forgot the name) with a Solid Snake skin got teleported from a nether portal close to my house. He then dropped a tnt bomb close by, not affecting my base any, and then proceeded to dig his way into my hideout.

I guess he took pity on me because I was starting out and proceeded to say &quot;It&#39;s not safe to go alone, take this!&quot; and threw me his diamond pickaxe. He then said something about [sp]operation red[/sp] and said &quot;kill me, my base isn&#39;t too far from here, I&#39;ll bring more supplies.&quot; With everyone screaming DO IT FAGGOT I killed him.

I then proceeded to make my once was tree farming area into a living room.

Not bad for an hour.[/QUOTE]

I spent a while looking for chests, TNTing their hidden respawn rooms, and I went over a hill. There was a small overhanging cliff, fully stone, except one area at floor level made of dirt. I decided to dig through the dirt, thinking I&#39;d end up at the other side. To my surprise, I found a chest. What was in it?
Diamonds, gold, iron, slimeballs, and lapis.

It turns out this was devildex&#39;s hidden item cache he mentioned in the sign, and I took all the goods. After digging out a bit more, I found another chest, with more items. I looked at chat to see the words &quot;TylerCB&quot;, said by devildex123. He then said &quot;camp shellshock&quot;, to which I replied &quot;I know&quot;. But here&#39;s what I was proud of.
I snuck up behind him, so he couldn&#39;t see me, and then he said &quot;where are u?&quot;. Immediately, I knew what I had to say, so I typed;

He span around and I hit him with my diamond sword, knocking him into lava. He dropped iron, gold and slimeballs, and couldn&#39;t respawn at his bed.
