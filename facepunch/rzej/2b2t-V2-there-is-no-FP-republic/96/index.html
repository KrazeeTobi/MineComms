Yeah, I just respawned there earlier today, and it was clear. Don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like now.

ZCal and I joined .US last night since .NET was down, and stumbled upon two very nice young fellas. They were building a castle and we set out to upstage them with a larger one... we ended up building one meant to merge into theirs. =P

However, I joined an hour or so ago and saw that a couple of the regular trolls from .NET had joined (chris being one) and were in the middle of griefing everything, so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on at spawn at this point.

Good luck! &gt;_&gt;"

Can I swear at you here without getting banned? I really want to. I&#39;ll make sure it&#39;s lava&#39;d again as soon as .us goes back up.

[QUOTE=RZ III;32085922]I dug a hole through the wall with my bare hands, but my guess is Ziggy or his pet closed it up. There was also Jesse getting in my way thinkin&#39; he/she was gonna do something (which never amounted to much considering Jesse couldn&#39;t even get past the lava).

Edit: I did make it to the water, but both times I managed to make it past Jesse&#39;s blundering self, I got killed by Skeles on the way to safer lands and loads of pigsteak.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=RZ III;32085922]I dug a hole through the wall with my bare hands, but my guess is Ziggy or his pet closed it up. There was also Jesse getting in my way thinkin&#39; he/she was gonna do something (which never amounted to much considering Jesse couldn&#39;t even get past the lava).

Edit: I did make it to the water, but both times I managed to make it past Jesse&#39;s blundering self, I got killed by Skeles on the way to safer lands and loads of pigsteak.[/QUOTE]

Are you kidding me. I did all that myself. Ziggy wasn&#39;t even at spawn until I&#39;d already completely enclosed it and had lava pouring right in the position where you spawn.  It took quite a bit of effort, and I consider it one of my better feats of trolling you morons, and I don&#39;t want ziggy taking my credit.

[editline]3rd September 2011[/editline]
