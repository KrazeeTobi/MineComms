Agreed. In my opinion you should be able to fly/speed, or walk. Whichever you prefer - because its an [u]anarchy[/u] server. And this is going to sound hypocritical but there should be a cap like there is on flying, for 5-10 seconds to prevent people from sperging out with maxed speeds flying through chunks."

This is basically my (our) intent. I could add a bunch of plugins that allows you to run super fast, fly around and what not, but I want to run it vanilla which leads me to blocking these. You can still put through effort to cheat, you won&#39;t be told to stop or be kicked.

If the bukkit team keeps being slow, it will run on 1.7.2 with pistons disabled meanwhile. You can downgrade and play if you want."

                        <postrender input="I don&#39;t see how any of you could possibly suggest that flying is a good idea on this server. Maybe on a building server, but this isn&#39;t one, this is a 1 man vs. the world server. There&#39;s combat involved. How the fuck would combat work if one person was walking while another person could zoom by from the air raining down volleys of arrows on him? Say what you will about anarchy, but that is complete bullshit and makes the game not fun for anyone. The people that play the game legit are being destroyed, and the people that hack are not even getting a challenge. What&#39;s the point of playing the game if anyone you pass you can kill with ease?

I never got why people used flyhacks to get really far away from spawn. For every block out you go, the area that you can explore gets exponentially bigger. (5 blocks out there&#39;s a total of 25 blocks, 10 blocks out there&#39;s 100, etc, I&#39;m sure you get simple math) This means that at 100,000 blocks out the chances of finding anyone&#39;s base is microscopic at best, nor are you at risk of your own base getting griefed. So what&#39;s the point? What&#39;s the difference between playing 100,000 blocks out on this server, or playing on your own singleplayer game? Surely it&#39;s easier to build in a single player server, or at least your own small mp server, where the lag isn&#39;t nearly as crippling? So why do you do it then? Is it so that you can tell everyone that you&#39;re some crazy distance like 200,000 blocks out and expect someone to look at you in awe and admire you or something? Because that&#39;s not how we look at you, at all. We look at you as the asshole that lags up our server and causes housemaster to bring it down, completely. Let me remind you that the reason none of us have played on it for the last few days was because of everyone that was using flyhacks. Honestly, why do you fly? I truly don&#39;t understand, please, explain it to me. There&#39;s no bases to loot out there, building a base there is practically the same as building it in SP except with crippling server lag. Why do you fly?

Also all the X-Ray people. At least this one has a purpose. With an X-Ray hack you can easily find hidden bases and loot them to quickly become rich, saving you hours of work. I get that. But why use it when it ruins the whole fun of the entire server. For example, my base has a rather intricate entrance system that looks like an average mountain but comes apart to be an entrance to the base. I think it&#39;s cool because of all the work that was put into it. (sticky pistons aren&#39;t cheap, those guys are harder to acquire than diamonds) I think that when someone does actually stumble apon the system completely by accident, they&#39;d be really impressed, and would enter to see a quite established base with plenty to loot. But what&#39;s the point of making cool hidden entrances when you can just X-Ray chests and figure out exactly where my base is? You&#39;re ruining the whole experience of living on the edge by building your base moderately close to the top, and camouflaging it really well so that average passerby&#39;s don&#39;t notice it and mistake it for another mountain. The only way we can protect ourselves from X-Ray hacks is by building all our bases at bedrock and hoping that it&#39;s too far away for you to see the chests.

I know you guys try to justify this stuff by &#39;Anarchy server&#39; but honestly, there&#39;s a difference between anarchy and being a total asshat. Like someone&#39;s already said, the game should be played as anarchy, but within the game&#39;s limits. Not anarchy as in use any 3rd party program you want, go wild. Using hacks you&#39;re totally ruining the fun of everybody on the server, whether it be the immense lag, server being shut down, or pillaging bases. And I know what you&#39;re gonna say, &quot;No one is supposed to enjoy being looted!&quot; There&#39;s a difference between looting someone&#39;s base and what you&#39;re doing. When you loot someone&#39;s base, steal all their valubles, drop lava everywhere and leave a sign saying &quot;HIDE YOUR BASE BETTER FAGGOT&quot;, the person gets mad for a second, and then realizes that&#39;s the risk of playing this game. They accepted the risk when they started the game, and when it happened to them, well, all it teaches them is to hide their base better. When you use hacks you aren&#39;t playing anarchy, you&#39;re literally ruining the game for everyone else. When you loot a base you didn&#39;t do it legitimately, you did it by cheating. We can keep arguing about this in minecraft, but let me give you an example in real world terms. Say you&#39;re playing poker. When you play a hand, you&#39;re living on the edge, you know the risks, and rewards. That&#39;s how it would be like if everyone is playing the game the way it was meant to be played. When someone hacks, that&#39;s the equivalent of playing poker with someone who has an ace up their sleve. Face it, you guys know it&#39;s bullshit, you&#39;re all just in denial about it and think that just because it&#39;s an anarchy server and I won&#39;t get banned for it, I can do what I want without regard for anyone else&#39;s enjoyment.

That&#39;s all I have to say on the matter.

Polly brought up a good point. The only time I think it&#39;s ever acceptable to fly is when you&#39;re building something on the ceiling of your base and you don&#39;t want to spend time building scaffolding or vertical columns every 5 blocks. But that&#39;s about it."

                        <postrender input="I agree with most of what you say, but I use flying to help build my base as it has very high ceilings, with chandeliers and intricate patterns. Scaffolding is very annoying because I often fall off and acquire unneeded damage, waste time and armor points...you get what I mean.

But I think all this argument about flying/X-ray is totally pointless because what makes an anarchy server is people making a choice. People make a choice about using X-Rays or flying because it enhances the game experience for them somehow and I think that that should be okay. If your base is found by an X-Rayer, should&#39;ve hidden it better or been further out. Going further out? If you choose, you can get a fly mod and go faster.

Really what I mean to say is that people have a choice, and to allow the server to function like it says (anarchy), they should be allowed that choice. The only thing other people can do is adapt."

But I think all this argument about flying/X-ray is totally pointless because what makes an anarchy server is people making a choice. People make a choice about using X-Rays or flying because it enhances the game experience for them somehow and I think that that should be okay. If your base is found by an X-Rayer, should&#39;ve hidden it better or been further out. Going further out? If you choose, you can get a fly mod and go faster.

Really what I mean to say is that people have a choice, and to allow the server to function like it says (anarchy), they should be allowed that choice. The only thing other people can do is adapt.</span>

Wait what point are you trying to make? That looting bases is ok? Using what you quoted it seems like the alternative is not looting other people&#39;s bases at all. The question isn&#39;t whether it&#39;s ok to loot bases, it&#39;s whether it&#39;s ok to loot them by hacking."

Indeed. I am enjoying adapting to a server [i]that is currently down because of flying[/i].

I mean, seriously, do you really want an actual &quot;anarchy&quot; server with absolutely no rules governing flying just to nitpick and stay true to the definition of &quot;anarchy&quot;, or [i]do you want a server to actually be able to play on[/i]?

X-ray -- fair enough. If there was a way to ban them, I&#39;d be fine with it. If not, I&#39;m fine with it. [i]If I actually have a server to play on, even better.[/i]

Sure, flying is a choice and a convenient way to build your base. [i]Except I cannot build anything in my base when the server is down due to flying.[/i]


I hope you&#39;re getting the subtle hints I&#39;m laying out here to illustrate my point."

But I think all this argument about flying/X-ray is totally pointless because what makes an anarchy server is people making a choice. People make a choice about using X-Rays or flying because it enhances the game experience for them somehow and I think that that should be okay. If your base is found by an X-Rayer, should&#39;ve hidden it better or been further out. Going further out? If you choose, you can get a fly mod and go faster.

Really what I mean to say is that people have a choice, and to allow the server to function like it says (anarchy), they should be allowed that choice. The only thing other people can do is adapt.[/QUOTE]

Indeed. I am enjoying adapting to a server [i]that is currently down because of flying[/i].

I mean, seriously, do you really want an actual &quot;anarchy&quot; server with absolutely no rules governing flying just to nitpick and stay true to the definition of &quot;anarchy&quot;, or [i]do you want a server to actually be able to play on[/i]?

X-ray -- fair enough. If there was a way to ban them, I&#39;d be fine with it. If not, I&#39;m fine with it. [i]If I actually have a server to play on, even better.[/i]

Sure, flying is a choice and a convenient way to build your base. [i]Except I cannot build anything in my base when the server is down due to flying.[/i]


I hope you&#39;re getting the subtle hints I&#39;m laying out here to illustrate my point.</span>
