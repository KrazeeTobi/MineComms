Lol, we were actually planning to cover up the tunnel, except we had members of our party that hadn&#39;t gotten to the base yet. I knew that the only failpoint would be the nether, there&#39;s no way anyone would walk 80,000 blocks legit. I&#39;m actually pretty amazed you found the gate under the nether, good job. Anyways, thank you. 2b2t has been taking up WAAAAY too much time in my life these past few weeks, I had promised myself I would quit when this last base got raped. Thank you for freeing me.

[editline]4th August 2011[/editline]

I have one question, did you Xray when you were walking through the nether? I&#39;m not gonna scold you for it, I&#39;m just curious.

[editline]4th August 2011[/editline]

By the way, the coordinates are special. I never got a chance to write it on a sign outside the nethergate however. The Real-World Coords seem random, but the nether coordinates are z= -9876, x=-5432 y=10

The last surviving piece of our base, so long sweet prince.

The last surviving piece of our base, so long sweet prince.

[B]PHAGOCYIT&#39;C AMAZING 2B2T ADVENTURE[/B]
This is about one month&#39;s worth of screenshots.

[B]PART ONE: RANDOM SHIT[/B]
So here&#39;s my very first base. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/1kwzm.png[/IMG]
Here&#39;s something I found while flying around. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/3nZaj.jpg[/IMG]
Here&#39;s an amazing sandstone castle I found. Too bad it&#39;s griefed. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/oJs2j.jpg[/IMG]
This was right on top of base five. Who is Murk? [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Vlhaf.png[/IMG]
This was on a mountain near base five. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KCbr1.png[/IMG]
Here&#39;s a really cool land formation I found. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GhsUz.jpg[/IMG]

[B]PART TWO: THE REBIRTH OF BASE FIVE[/B]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/V9WDG.png[/IMG]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/fuE9U.jpg[/IMG]
I found your stuff cheez &lt;3 [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/W1Qbr.png[/IMG]
I really spent quite some time making Base Five look spiffy. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Ck8hn.png[/IMG]
After this, the base was griefed. I&#39;ll post more pics in a bit.

[B]PART THREE: THE TWIN OF BASE FIVE[/B]
This is a nice abandoned base I found. It&#39;s very similar to Base Five. It must have been made by the same people.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/onvrR.jpg[/IMG]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/sF9yJ.png[/IMG]
Seeing people&#39;s old signs like this makes me feel weird. It&#39;s a sad, but happy feeling. Hard to describe.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/YAmMD.png[/IMG]

[B]PART THREE AND ONE HALF: THE SHORT LIVED BASE[/B]
This base lasted about an hour before someone posted the coords in chat accidentally.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/QlscF.png[/IMG]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/BtYts.png[/IMG]
That was my grave marker for the base after we left it.

All right, that&#39;s it for now. I will upload more pictures later."

[B]PHAGOCYIT&#39;C AMAZING 2B2T ADVENTURE[/B]
This is about one month&#39;s worth of screenshots.

[B]PART ONE: RANDOM SHIT[/B]
So here&#39;s my very first base. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/1kwzm.png[/IMG]
Here&#39;s something I found while flying around. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/3nZaj.jpg[/IMG]
Here&#39;s an amazing sandstone castle I found. Too bad it&#39;s griefed. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/oJs2j.jpg[/IMG]
This was right on top of base five. Who is Murk? [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Vlhaf.png[/IMG]
This was on a mountain near base five. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/KCbr1.png[/IMG]
Here&#39;s a really cool land formation I found. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GhsUz.jpg[/IMG]

[B]PART TWO: THE REBIRTH OF BASE FIVE[/B]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/V9WDG.png[/IMG]
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/fuE9U.jpg[/IMG]
I found your stuff cheez &lt;3 [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/W1Qbr.png[/IMG]
I really spent quite some time making Base Five look spiffy. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Ck8hn.png[/IMG]
After this, the base was griefed. I&#39;ll post more pics in a bit.

[B]PART THREE: THE TWIN OF BASE FIVE[/B]
This is a nice abandoned base I found. It&#39;s very similar to Base Five. It must have been made by the same people.

Seeing people&#39;s old signs like this makes me feel weird. It&#39;s a sad, but happy feeling. Hard to describe.

[B]PART THREE AND ONE HALF: THE SHORT LIVED BASE[/B]
This base lasted about an hour before someone posted the coords in chat accidentally.

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/BtYts.png[/IMG]
That was my grave marker for the base after we left it.

All right, that&#39;s it for now. I will upload more pictures later.</span>

I was notorious with the older people on the server and that&#39;s kinda why I didn&#39;t want to release the information because I haven&#39;t had the experiences with you guys.

Keep in mind that all of this is [I]before[/I] the server was down for weeks. This means that any material gathered were legitimately obtained.
All images are thumbed due to size, click to enlarge.

What you&#39;re about to see is documentation of about half of the bases I&#39;ve visited. Since, at the beginning, I wasn&#39;t very good at logging destinations, there&#39;s quite a bit missing. Some of it will be covered by part of the the internal Ownzone document of destinations I&#39;ve decided to leak, as well.

Many of the places didn&#39;t contain names or a name, so I&#39;ve just come up with some random name based on what the place looked like. I only have [I]very[/I] few before/after pictures because I&#39;ve had to move in and out at a pretty fast pace and therefore forgot it in the haste.

[quote][B]chillyt[/B]

This is probably the first notable base I&#39;ve raided. It was owned by a guy called chillyt. For some reason I didn&#39;t bring any equipment with me, except TNT, because I didn&#39;t expect to raid anyone. So he was rushing at me with his diamond sword, I managed to TNT him and take his shit. He proceeded to ask me to give me a few diamonds back. I was like &quot;wtf&quot; because obviously I had the upper hand so he had to LET ME leave? 
Nope.

Before:

After:
[t]http://localhostr.com/files/59BKkih/2011-05-16_12.16.37.png[/t]

I have a bunch of pictures of his base but I won&#39;t bore you with that.
[/quote]

[quote][B]-unknown-[/B]

I have literally no idea where this is. I remember it&#39;s on top of a mountain with a decently big base underneath. I erased it with many stacks of TNT. This was early on, too, so documentation is scarce.
[t]http://localhostr.com/files/gQtrAkj/2011-05-16_13.15.57.png[/t]

I&#39;m [I]fairly[/I] certain it&#39;s here, but no promises:

I visited some place and it was already raided by Oldhamfu. I don&#39;t know if any of you are familiar with him, but he&#39;s an old guy on the server, no longer playing. 
[t]http://localhostr.com/files/fXYMaBI/2011-06-05_13.02.11.png[/t]

Then, as the sign suggest, I visited him. No images of this, see the leaked document at the bottom for his coordinates. It&#39;s a pretty impressive base he had, albeit messy. Have a look if you have the time.

[quote][B]20147024[/B]

It&#39;s some FP dude who said he was amazed his base was untouched. I found it two or three days later.

I don&#39;t know who this is. Had nothing to destroy or loot. Looked like a newly started base.

A very cool ship I found:
[t]http://localhostr.com/files/LhagS5B/2011-06-05_12.25.55.png[/t]

It had no real loot, but suddenly I spotted a lot of diamond equipment in the water. It looks like the owner had died in the water and never came back since.

[t]http://localhostr.com/files/nlF6CBT/2011-06-05_12.33.13.png[/t]
You can probably tell the story of the ship by the looks of the glitched TNT to the right.

[quote][B]-unknown-[/B]

Found a random base that looked newly started. Had very few TNT with me due to me coming from a raid.

[quote][B]chumchum_II[/B]
chumchum_II has always been notorious with Ownzone because he compromised the first Ownzone settlement back in March, I think. It caused us to move, and then, a few hours before the server went down for weeks, I visited.
We&#39;re even.
[t]http://localhostr.com/files/Vqy52mA/2011-06-05_17.39.03.png[/t]

This sign was set up literally 1 minute before the server shut down and it lagged so much it isn&#39;t even positioned correctly.
[t]http://localhostr.com/files/1olE6om/2011-06-05_17.55.19.png[/t]

I couldn&#39;t see the sign when I logged back in after the server went back up, but that was because I was somewhere else due to the immense lag. Before I realized that, I had set up a new sign because I thought the first one was gone:

chumchum himself stated in the previous thread that he was sad of the loss of the base because his friends did most of the work. There was about 8 beds in there. 
Let this be a lesson to all of you: don&#39;t work with people with notorious reputation. That includes me. If someone comes after me and I live in your base, it&#39;ll be your problem too.

[quote][B][U]The final loot[/U][/B]
We proceeded to compile a picture of all the valuables we had collected during our time on 2b2t from raiding. Very little of what you&#39;re about to see is from mining. We acquired all this legitimately, and we played many hours to acquire it because (by far) most bases we raided before the dupe exploit only had 5-15 diamonds, half to a whole stack of iron and very little gold. 

As you can see by the dates in the picture filenames, this is [u]before[/u] the loot from chumchum was added to the chest.

This is why I was very upset about all of this duping going on, because it essentially made our stash of valuables worthless. It&#39;s not so much about the items, it&#39;s about how much playtime we put into getting these items. All of this means nothing now, and it kinda sucks. Now everyone and their mother has a stack of diamond blocks and it&#39;s not even funny to steal because it took them 30 seconds to get it. Back in the days, I tell you, stealing half a stack of diamonds was a big thing because all of them was mined legitimately.

[B]So what am I doing now?[/B]
If you&#39;ve followed the thread you know Ownzone II was taken out by The Trinity, so we moved elsewhere to what is now known as Ownzone III. We will post pictures of the base once we complete the construction. Or a video. I don&#39;t know.

We have a vague idea where this Trinity is located and we&#39;re considering finding them, but honestly, we can&#39;t be assed. No hard feelings against The Trinity. They expertly erased Ownzone II and I&#39;m happy it wasn&#39;t some faggot raid with 20 TNT coming to blow our bedroom up and poke us in the chat for months afterwards.

I&#39;ve been taking a break from 2b2t the past few weeks due to being busy IRL but I&#39;ll definitely consider coming back.

For those of you who doesn&#39;t know, Ownzone is two people - me and someone else - and after 2b2t went back up, we&#39;ve gained a number of inters around the map that is 2b2t.

                            <span v-pre>Alright, I guess it&#39;s time to release some information. I briefly mentioned I&#39;d do it in the OP, but never got around to do it.
I was notorious with the older people on the server and that&#39;s kinda why I didn&#39;t want to release the information because I haven&#39;t had the experiences with you guys.

Keep in mind that all of this is [I]before[/I] the server was down for weeks. This means that any material gathered were legitimately obtained.
All images are thumbed due to size, click to enlarge.

What you&#39;re about to see is documentation of about half of the bases I&#39;ve visited. Since, at the beginning, I wasn&#39;t very good at logging destinations, there&#39;s quite a bit missing. Some of it will be covered by part of the the internal Ownzone document of destinations I&#39;ve decided to leak, as well.

Many of the places didn&#39;t contain names or a name, so I&#39;ve just come up with some random name based on what the place looked like. I only have [I]very[/I] few before/after pictures because I&#39;ve had to move in and out at a pretty fast pace and therefore forgot it in the haste.

[quote][B]chillyt[/B]

This is probably the first notable base I&#39;ve raided. It was owned by a guy called chillyt. For some reason I didn&#39;t bring any equipment with me, except TNT, because I didn&#39;t expect to raid anyone. So he was rushing at me with his diamond sword, I managed to TNT him and take his shit. He proceeded to ask me to give me a few diamonds back. I was like &quot;wtf&quot; because obviously I had the upper hand so he had to LET ME leave? 
Nope.

I have a bunch of pictures of his base but I won&#39;t bore you with that.

[quote][B]-unknown-[/B]

I have literally no idea where this is. I remember it&#39;s on top of a mountain with a decently big base underneath. I erased it with many stacks of TNT. This was early on, too, so documentation is scarce.

I visited some place and it was already raided by Oldhamfu. I don&#39;t know if any of you are familiar with him, but he&#39;s an old guy on the server, no longer playing. 
[t]http://localhostr.com/files/fXYMaBI/2011-06-05_13.02.11.png[/t]

Then, as the sign suggest, I visited him. No images of this, see the leaked document at the bottom for his coordinates. It&#39;s a pretty impressive base he had, albeit messy. Have a look if you have the time.

[quote][B]20147024[/B]

It&#39;s some FP dude who said he was amazed his base was untouched. I found it two or three days later.

A very cool ship I found:

It had no real loot, but suddenly I spotted a lot of diamond equipment in the water. It looks like the owner had died in the water and never came back since.

[t]http://localhostr.com/files/nlF6CBT/2011-06-05_12.33.13.png[/t]
You can probably tell the story of the ship by the looks of the glitched TNT to the right.

We&#39;re even.

I couldn&#39;t see the sign when I logged back in after the server went back up, but that was because I was somewhere else due to the immense lag. Before I realized that, I had set up a new sign because I thought the first one was gone:
