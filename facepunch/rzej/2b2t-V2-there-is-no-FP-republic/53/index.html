Look into 64-bit version of Java, if you haven&#39;t already. It helped my friends&#39; similar problems.

[QUOTE=Natahster;31437019]Yeah OP exaggerates. I was exploring around spawn or a long time and no one attacked me. Everyone already has their own base or they already walked far out. It seems smarter to build closer to spawn. But ofcourse it&#39;s risky and you&#39;d have to crouch a lot.[/QUOTE]
2b2t has changed. Almost none of the old people play regularly on the server anymore. I know you don&#39;t like when I say it like this, but the server is filled with new people and they don&#39;t know 2b2t yet. It&#39;s all fine, but as an old player, it kinda sucks for me. 
I hate to say it like this because it sounds stupid, but BACK IN THE DAYS you&#39;d be treated differently on the server. This is, of course, also due to the prevention of flying. It makes baserape more time consuming, even if you know where they are. I currently have somewhere between 25 and 30 bases on my list of places I&#39;ve visited, only 2 of which are after 2b2t was up again, simply because none of the old people are playing and the new peoples&#39; bases are done in the matter of very few days or sometimes hours. Eventually they&#39;ll learn but chances are they&#39;ve left the server by the time they lose their 3rd base. It&#39;s understandable, but it sort of ruins the 2b2t experience that is anarchy.
Most of this probably made no sense, so I apologize if some deciphering is needed.
[QUOTE=Raptor_S;31436824]I love how OP is all &quot;this is srs bisness u will die here dawg u have no chance dawg im a morpheus&quot; :v:
Anyway, I&#39;m enjoing the server so far.[/QUOTE]
I wrote it like that because that&#39;s how 2b2t works - or should work, if you will. It&#39;s the nature of the game.
And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as bad as your mimic indicates, so I guess we both exaggerate a bit!"

I currently have somewhere between 25 and 30 bases on my list of places I&#39;ve visited, only 2 of which are after 2b2t was up again, simply because none of the old people are playing and the new peoples&#39; bases are done in the matter of very few days or sometimes hours. Eventually they&#39;ll learn but chances are they&#39;ve left the server by the time they lose their 3rd base. It&#39;s understandable, but it sort of ruins the 2b2t experience that is anarchy.
Most of this probably made no sense, so I apologize if some deciphering is needed.
[QUOTE=Raptor_S;31436824]I love how OP is all &quot;this is srs bisness u will die here dawg u have no chance dawg im a morpheus&quot; :v:
Anyway, I&#39;m enjoing the server so far.[/QUOTE]
I wrote it like that because that&#39;s how 2b2t works - or should work, if you will. It&#39;s the nature of the game.
And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as bad as your mimic indicates, so I guess we both exaggerate a bit!</span>

I was minding my business in the nether when I saw Lesbians and luvil09 were going nuts in chat about finding some giant tunnel haven with tons of glowstone and diamond blocks. I asked for coords when they left, and they gave them to me. However they didn&#39;t give the exact coords of the entrance until they were there. I should have realized then that trusting them was a bad idea. I followed them into this tunnel that looked really familiar, and then I realized that I had been there before. It&#39;s pretty fucking close to spawn, and it used to be a lot more elaborate and have way more diamond. Anyway, we head into the tunnel and they start mining away at iron and redstone; the only reason I went was to find diamond blocks they may have missed. It&#39;s a huge fucking mine so we got separated at one point, and all of a sudden they said they found diamonds and gave me their location. At this point I had one heart left after encountering a bunch of creepers down one of the tunnels, and asked for any food since I was near death. Big mistake, never tell anyone how close you are to death. I walked up to where they were and they paused for a few seconds, making me think they were going to throw out a porkchop. Wrong. They caught me off guard and attacked me, and I lost a lot of shit. Two sets of diamond tools, set of diamond armor, half a stack of diamonds, a bunch of torches, coal, redstone, and other things that are pretty valuable. 

My own stupidity, I guess I deserved it. However now they&#39;re going on in chat acting innocent and saying I attacked them and being retarded fucks about it. I&#39;ll get over it, still sucks though. Coords for their &quot;sacred tunnel&quot; that no longer has anything worthwhile in it is about 500x 210z.

Try this cycle instead:
Run, hide, build, rape, loot.
Repeat step 4 and 5 as many times as you please."
