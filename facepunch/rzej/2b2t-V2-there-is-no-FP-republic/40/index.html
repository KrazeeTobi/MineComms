I cant say I&#39;m happy about it either, at least everybody on my team is actually quite disappointed but that&#39;s what 2b2t is about, complete and total anarchy and the motto of the server really rings true ... &quot;Trust no one&quot;. At least Funnybunny and his team had the courtesy to leave us some helpful items to help us re-build. We tnt&#39;d his base and he got to do the same with ours. I cant really blame him for doing this either after all we stole ALL of his items and i have to admit he was really good at acting ... although he did slip up at the end. He also picked a real opportune moment to strike, while my friends and i were dicking around in TF2 he launched the assault on our base. All i can really say about this is that this experience has taught my team some really important lessons about 2b2t.

All I&#39;m hoping for is that if funnybunny writes his essay, he doesnt just flat out call us fags or antagonize us like he did in his ... &quot;poem&quot; that he left at our base.

But it&#39;s totally worth it:v:

Okay so where do I begin&amp;#8230; This is the tale of the week-long endeavor my group had with Freak472&amp;#8217;s group. It involves sabotage, betrayal, espionage, straight up slaughter, and gratuitous amounts of dynamite. Get ready for a hefty read, because this was about the coolest thing I&amp;#8217;ve ever done in minecraft so I&amp;#8217;m not gonna spare any detail.

So, first let me introduce my group. It consists of:
Parcec: Me
Enigma937: Melkor (FP member)
Original_Ganker: Accomplice, pro at redstone circuits
Brother_Snake: Accomplice, pro at building bases
Shadowkiller: Accomplice, builds bases with Brother_Snake, explores a lot
Kstalawl: Originally Melkor, later this was someone else, I&amp;#8217;ll go into detail later.

We are all friends IRL, so we don&amp;#8217;t worry about espionage, and we always talk on skype when we play, it&amp;#8217;s nice not having to type to each other. 

The other group consisted of 6(?) people, sorry I don&#39;t know all of you, I only really interacted with, Freak472, chaoslink23, Toothycat, and Godilla101.
I&amp;#8217;ll skip the boring bits of our first base, and simply start the story the day this whole thing began, when the server came back up as 1.7.2, and everyone found out you could dupe again. At this point, our base was already fully built, pics of it were already up on facepunch: 
[quote][img]http://gyazo.com/7ad75eb55d09de3f28b92929b9b3c935.png[/img][/quote]
We started out the day by gathering up or 2 sticky pistons, and trying to dupe them. The tricky part was that the SP method involved 3 sticky pistons, one for the clock, one for the piston, and one used as a dupe. The standard repeater clock method didn&amp;#8217;t work because the server was lagging. After a bit of panicking, Original_Ganker easily solved this problem by manually flipping a lever back and forth really fast, which, as luck may have it, gave us a third piston, letting us get our duping setup. We duped a little bit, and after a while I started getting perfectionst and tried to set up multiple lanes of dupers powered by a single clock for maximum efficiency. To test this out, Ganker put down dynamite in the duper. It was working fine, except when the dynamite travelled a few blocks, and hit an unfortunately placed redstone torch. The whole place exploded, I had to walk back from spawn, that&amp;#8217;s when I made this post:
[quote][img]http://gyazo.com/9dcfa8431fbe34f0f5360bca7c0542fe.png[/img][/quote]
Keep this image in mind for later.

This is where all the action began. Melkor, who was playing as kstalawl at the time, was wandering outside the base at the time, when he saw a name. Seeing enemy players was very, very rare for us, so he followed it and found more people there. He called over Ganker to his location, who brought him full diamond armor, and they contemplated going in. I told them &amp;#8220;Wait, it could be an FP base!&amp;#8221; To which they replied they didn&amp;#8217;t recognize any names, so I just said &amp;#8216;go ahead&amp;#8217; and they jumped in from the ceiling, slaughtering everyone in the base. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure Melkor in his fury killed Ganker on accident, who respawned at our base and got back to mining duped items. The whole time I was working on getting a better duping setup going, which I did, and Ganker went AFK gathering hundreds of TNT blocks. We soon started pumping out everything you can imagine, Diamond, Iron, Gold, and TNT blocks. Original_Ganker had to go so he sat AFK collecting hundreds of dynamite blocks. After a little bit of stockpiling, we felt like we ruled the server. Yet, the novelty soon began to wear off as we realized that it&amp;#8217;s pretty boring playing the game when you&amp;#8217;re horrendously overpowered. In the meantime, I was watching the chat unfold, as the entire party we just raided flipped out when Melkor revealed their coordinates in the server chat. A distinctive &amp;#8220;NOOOOOOO&amp;#8221; was heard from one of their gang. Looking to utilize some of our newly found TNT, he filled their base with it and detonated it, leaving nothing for them to return to. He then returned to our base, and I left to eat dinner.

Fast forward two hours. I come back to see a skype message saying &amp;#8220;FUCK DUDE THEY FOUND OUR BASE.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;WERE FUCKED MAN THEY GOT IT ALL.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;shit.&amp;#8221; I join the call and log on to see what the fuck is going on. To my surprise, I log in to see someone wearing no armor staring back at me. Piece of cake I think, and I start attacking him. In an attempt to get away he jumps down into a giant ravine that was built all around our base, all the way down to bedrock, which was meant to be filled with lava. I followed him into it and proceeded to attack, only to be suddenly struck from behind by someone else in full diamond, so in a panic I logged out. Fast forward a couple minutes, I log back in and make my way back up to our base. Melkor assures me that the coast is safe, as he&amp;#8217;s been tracking them to a big wall a few hundred blocks from our base. (By the way guys, we built that wall. That was all the cobble we got from digging all the way to bedrock. If we had more time it would have gone all the way to the other side where there was water.) Using this time, I gather up anything of value we have left in our base, and dump it into a chest under a tree. I make another chest on the other side, and while I&amp;#8217;m looking through what to put into it I notice 3 guys in full diamond rushing right at me. Knowing those exposed chests were our only chance of surviving, I lead these guys into the desert, desperately trying to get away. I had a bow, but unfortunately, had put the arrows in the chest without thinking. Had I had those arrows, this entire adventure would have been averted, because I was only being chased by people with melee swords. As I led this gang away from our base, I was shouting at Melkor over Skype to cover up the chests. Eventually, Melkor did do so, but he only covered up one, not seeing the other because it was dark. Melkor died and my other friend shadow logged on, who tried to grab anything he could out of the base and made it out without them noticing. While Melkor was walking back from spawn shadow observed that the gang was camping where I last logged off, with wolves, and apparently surrounded me in a building. At this point Melkor had to go for a bit, and I was stuck without an account, so I hopped on to Kstalawl and decided to check out what was going on. I logged in just in time to see someone ask in chat, &amp;#8220;Does anyone know who Parcec is?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;IDK lol&amp;#8221; I answered, only to see their gang say &amp;#8220;I thought he was with you&amp;#8221; To which I answered, &amp;#8220;Nah lol, he&amp;#8217;s not with us&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Us?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Me and Original_Ganker&amp;#8221; I replied, thinking they killed him when he was AFKing. (I don&amp;#8217;t know if they did, to this day) It was that brief conversation with them that started the whole espionage act that I played throughout the next week. 

Look what they did to my baby :(
[QUOTE=halofreak472;31168251][img]http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/6935/itdead.png[/img][/QUOTE]

We all kinda logged off, and hopped on a few hours later. To my surprise, I logged in to find no-one camping me, and on close inspection I found a slimeball on top of the structure (I have no Idea why it was there). I brought this slimeball back to our small new base that Shadow and Brother_Snake were already working on, and created our only sticky piston. It was useless without a second one however. Figuring that our only hope rather than starting everything from scratch was tracking these guys down, I decided to try my best to convince them I was not allied with Original_Ganker and kstalawl. The basic story went that the base was mine, Ganker and kstalawl blew up their base, and then settled in mine, thinking it was abandoned, but I was really logged off. When I logged back on I was surprised by the guy infront of me, so I instinctively attacked him, considering he was an intruder in my base. At least, that was the story we were going to use. Recognizing the name Freak, I thought he was from FP (Half the server is from FP). Ends up the user I actually confused him for was FreakyMe, regardless, as luck would have it, a quick google search revealed my that Freak472 was indeed a facepuncher. I explained to my version of what happened, used my 2006 joindate and goldmembership as leverage; and, figuring he frequented this thread often, decided to remind him about my recent Anti-Hacking Rant (shown below) to set an image of myself as a sort of &amp;#8216;white knight&amp;#8217;. 

[QUOTE=FunnyBunny;31122247]I don&#39;t see how any of you could possibly suggest that flying is a good idea on this server. Maybe on a building server, but this isn&#39;t one, this is a 1 man vs. the world server. There&#39;s combat involved. How the fuck would combat work if one person was walking while another person could zoom by from the air raining down volleys of arrows on him? Say what you will about anarchy, but that is complete bullshit and makes the game not fun for anyone. The people that play the game legit are being destroyed, and the people that hack are not even getting a challenge. What&#39;s the point of playing the game if anyone you pass you can kill with ease?

I never got why people used flyhacks to get really far away from spawn. For every block out you go, the area that you can explore gets exponentially bigger. (5 blocks out there&#39;s a total of 25 blocks, 10 blocks out there&#39;s 100, etc, I&#39;m sure you get simple math) This means that at 100,000 blocks out the chances of finding anyone&#39;s base is microscopic at best, nor are you at risk of your own base getting griefed. So what&#39;s the point? What&#39;s the difference between playing 100,000 blocks out on this server, or playing on your own singleplayer game? Surely it&#39;s easier to build in a single player server, or at least your own small mp server, where the lag isn&#39;t nearly as crippling? So why do you do it then? Is it so that you can tell everyone that you&#39;re some crazy distance like 200,000 blocks out and expect someone to look at you in awe and admire you or something? Because that&#39;s not how we look at you, at all. We look at you as the asshole that lags up our server and causes housemaster to bring it down, completely. Let me remind you that the reason none of us have played on it for the last few days was because of everyone that was using flyhacks. Honestly, why do you fly? I truly don&#39;t understand, please, explain it to me. There&#39;s no bases to loot out there, building a base there is practically the same as building it in SP except with crippling server lag. Why do you fly?

Also all the X-Ray people. At least this one has a purpose. With an X-Ray hack you can easily find hidden bases and loot them to quickly become rich, saving you hours of work. I get that. But why use it when it ruins the whole fun of the entire server. For example, my base has a rather intricate entrance system that looks like an average mountain but comes apart to be an entrance to the base. I think it&#39;s cool because of all the work that was put into it. (sticky pistons aren&#39;t cheap, those guys are harder to acquire than diamonds) I think that when someone does actually stumble apon the system completely by accident, they&#39;d be really impressed, and would enter to see a quite established base with plenty to loot. But what&#39;s the point of making cool hidden entrances when you can just X-Ray chests and figure out exactly where my base is? You&#39;re ruining the whole experience of living on the edge by building your base moderately close to the top, and camouflaging it really well so that average passerby&#39;s don&#39;t notice it and mistake it for another mountain. The only way we can protect ourselves from X-Ray hacks is by building all our bases at bedrock and hoping that it&#39;s too far away for you to see the chests.

I know you guys try to justify this stuff by &#39;Anarchy server&#39; but honestly, there&#39;s a difference between anarchy and being a total asshat. Like someone&#39;s already said, the game should be played as anarchy, but within the game&#39;s limits. Not anarchy as in use any 3rd party program you want, go wild. Using hacks you&#39;re totally ruining the fun of everybody on the server, whether it be the immense lag, server being shut down, or pillaging bases. And I know what you&#39;re gonna say, &quot;No one is supposed to enjoy being looted!&quot; There&#39;s a difference between looting someone&#39;s base and what you&#39;re doing. When you loot someone&#39;s base, steal all their valubles, drop lava everywhere and leave a sign saying &quot;HIDE YOUR BASE BETTER FAGGOT&quot;, the person gets mad for a second, and then realizes that&#39;s the risk of playing this game. They accepted the risk when they started the game, and when it happened to them, well, all it teaches them is to hide their base better. When you use hacks you aren&#39;t playing anarchy, you&#39;re literally ruining the game for everyone else. When you loot a base you didn&#39;t do it legitimately, you did it by cheating. We can keep arguing about this in minecraft, but let me give you an example in real world terms. Say you&#39;re playing poker. When you play a hand, you&#39;re living on the edge, you know the risks, and rewards. That&#39;s how it would be like if everyone is playing the game the way it was meant to be played. When someone hacks, that&#39;s the equivalent of playing poker with someone who has an ace up their sleve. Face it, you guys know it&#39;s bullshit, you&#39;re all just in denial about it and think that just because it&#39;s an anarchy server and I won&#39;t get banned for it, I can do what I want without regard for anyone else&#39;s enjoyment.

That&#39;s all I have to say on the matter.

Polly brought up a good point. The only time I think it&#39;s ever acceptable to fly is when you&#39;re building something on the ceiling of your base and you don&#39;t want to spend time building scaffolding or vertical columns every 5 blocks. But that&#39;s about it.[/QUOTE]

At first, they were really shady, hardly replying to any private messages, so I was worried that they saw through my scheme. (My story was full of holes. If you had actually gone back to look through my posts in this thread, I constantly refer to me and a group of people, rather than me alone. Another example, go back to the picture of the duper gone wrong. There&#39;s another person in full diamond. This picture was taken roughly the same time we first attacked their base!) All those reasons, along with the fact that they had all of &amp;#8216;my&amp;#8217; items made them feel sorry/trustworthy enough to give me their coordinates, which was about 8k blocks from spawn. Well fuck I thought, considering my own cords of hardly 1,000 blocks away. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s our only hope&amp;#8221;, I thought to myself as I set out on the journey. I managed to survive and keep our gangs only set of diamond tools/armor, which helped me survive the 7,000 block journey. When I was within 500 blocks, I got a PM from Freak asking where I was, so I replied, &amp;#8220;Close&amp;#8221;. Less than a minute after, Toothycat, a member of their gang, said in chat &amp;#8220;LOL Parcec&amp;#8221;. My heart skipped a beat, as the thought that I walked all that space for nothing crossed my mind. Oh well, I&amp;#8217;ll walk the remaining 500 blocks and we&amp;#8217;ll see. To my surprise, I saw diamond wearing people walking around a frozen lake. I planned to set up a secret bed in a mountain before I went up to them, but Freak saw me and invited me over into their group. I was afraid that I might get ganged up on and killed, but to my surprise, I was let right into their tiny hiding hole, where I saw another sticky piston, wired up to a redstone repeater clock that I couldn&amp;#8217;t get working. (again) Noticing the lack of loot in the chests, I asked them where everything was, to which they replied that there was another guy, Godilla101, who was behind a few thousand blocks, that&amp;#8217;s the reason they had to stop, to wait for him to catch up. According to them, he had all sorts of diamond blocks, sticky pistons, you name it. The reason they couldn&amp;#8217;t get the duplicator working is because they also only had one sticky piston. The original plan was to steal their stuff, but realizing they could easily rebuild with Godilla&amp;#8217;s help, we decided it was best to wait. Their whole remaining gang went to sleep really early, and basically left me alone in the base. 

This was our chance. We decided we were going to march our sticky piston down to their sticky piston, dupe it, and start our own base of operations. The plan was brilliant. Ganker and Melkor set off, and I crafted some diamond armor sets and some stews and went to meet them in the middle. The rendezvous was a success, the piston arrived intact, and soon we were all armored up and ready to go. On the way back to their base we killed a few creepers and got 5 gunpowder, enough to make a TNT that we could dupe. At their base, Ganker used the same manual-flicky-switch method to dupe a single sticky piston, which let us create a working clock, and have an effective duper. We duped tons of sticky pistons, tons of iron, gold, diamond; we even carefully replaced the diamond back to 44 blocks, where it was before I even touched it.  When we were ready to leave we returned the duper back to its crippled mode, the only difference being it was slid over one block so that the piston clock would fit. Someone had noticed this the next day, but I simply explained to them that I was just fiddling with it trying to get it to work.  After we left the base, we walked 500 blocks, made a proxy base in the mountains, duped a bit more, made a secret stash (just incase), and logged off. 

The next day I wake up, get on and see the skype message &amp;#8220;Fuck I think they fixed duping &amp;#8211; Original_Ganker&amp;#8221;. The new Bukkit build came out and the server was finally updated. That meant no more fucking around, shit got real, no more infinite resources. We realized that we really didn&amp;#8217;t get to dupe that many things the night before, and that our only real option was to steal our original stuff back from them. To start the day Ganker and Melkor brought the recently duped resources back to our actual base at z=~2000, while I headed out to their base at around z=~8500. As I approached their base I got the same shady business, people not responding to my messeges, I thought they had abandoned me, yet, after 10 minutes, the same exact thing happened, someone came out and let me in the base. This time the base was at bedrock, and by the time I got there it was fairly set up, with an incinerator, a furnace room, a farm, mushroom farm, and a very thoroughly stocked food room filled with tons of mushroom stew. (They were all our mushrooms, Melkor was walking in the nether and found a patch of land with like 500 mushrooms, which he brought back to our original base). To make myself seem like a productive member, I quickly started working on a larger farm (Totally useless, small farm was more than enough, the big farm wasn&amp;#8217;t even finished) But while digging, I stumbled on a hidden chest. I quickly covered it up, but a few seconds later went back and checked it out. It had a hefty amount of diamond, among other things. I tried to cover it up, but someone had already saw me looking. &amp;#8220;Found this totally by accident lol&amp;#8221; I said, and I received a sarcastic sounding &amp;#8220;Uhuh&amp;#8221; from chaoslink. Just beyond this hidden chest I found another, with a few more nice items, and while digging around I found 3 gold blocks hidden behind the announcement board. This, along with a secret room I discovered later, pretty much taught me one thing. This base has a fuckton of secrets.

Throughout the following week I exchanged several facepunch PM&amp;#8217;s with Freak, where he revealed that he trusted me a lot more than I thought he did. He also conscripted me to build some traps, which I took from one of their designs, which I enjoyed because it improved my redstone abilities; as well as that was the place where I learned how to make quite possibly the best trap I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen. (The main premise is you&amp;#8217;re walking down a crude, poorly lit smoothstone stairway, and you step on a pressure plate. All of a sudden the wall a few blocks ahead pops out, and the step just before that retracts, so your momentum basically carries you into this freshly revealed lava pit.) While all this is going down, my squad&amp;#8217;s main base got raided, so all diamonds and iron left for us to use was the handful in the hidden cache. It soon became obvious that my little subterfuge plan HAD to succeed.

Now, at first, cooperating with these guys and earning their trust, I actually started to feel bad that I was about to steal everything. And that would have continued, except weird shit started happening at the base. First of all, it kept getting more and more secretive. Diamonds kept disappearing, hidden chests that were previously there were now gone. That, along with the fact that no one of their gang was on anymore was starting to get to me. The original plan was to have my whole squad surprise them in their base. They would have used my espionage to destroy their beds, so when they died they&amp;#8217;d be back at spawn. The plan was to have a sword, bow, full diamond, and a ton of slots filled with stew so that we&amp;#8217;d be prepared to take them on. Except, we ran into a couple problems. First of all, we had no diamond. All of our diamond had been jacked, except for the very little remaining which was made into tools. I had no diamond except for some tools, the enemy base I was in had gotten to the point where there was no diamond to be found. We could never get any of them on the server when we were on, and to make matters worse, my videocard died so I could only rarely play when I came over to someone&amp;#8217;s house. We weren&amp;#8217;t equipped to take them on at all. So I came over to a friends house today, and It was decided that, &amp;#8216;Fuck it, we&amp;#8217;re gonna do this now&amp;#8217;. We were logging in throughout the day, but no one was in the base. I gathered up all the items from the chests and put them all in the stockroom, organized by what was most important. We built a few hidden chests well outside their base, and shoved some stuff in there that we didn&amp;#8217;t want clogging our inventory. Now this is where the fun part begins.

We had 80 TNT, so we split it evenly between me, Shadow, and Brother_Snake, and we started tearing apart the base. The goal wasn&amp;#8217;t to be assholes. We were stripmining their base to look for chests. We did this carefully, one block at a time, so as to not destroy the chest itself. This payed off as we discovered a hidden chest with some nice goods in it, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t what we wanted. Sometime around here, kstalawl joined us, the real one, not Melkor. We kept detonating all over the base, until literally nothing was left, but then finally, in a stroke of luck Brother_Snake found one more hidden chest. We opened it and, Jackpot. Everything. Over 200 blocks of diamond, blocks of gold, Iron, practically everything they had. Our fears that they had it all in their inventories were extinguished when we found this chest. Brother_Snake piled it all in his inventory, and just before we were about to leave, we decided to utilize all their signs they had lying around their base and leave a commemoratory plaque. I wrote a rather rude note, sorry about that, I was kind of power high after realizing what we had accomplished. After reading it, everyone chuckled, and I put up another plaque next to it, &amp;#8220;-Signed, Funnybunny&amp;#8221;. Not 15 seconds after I placed this plaque I head over skype &amp;#8220;SHIT SOMEONE&amp;#8217;S HERE, LOG!&amp;#8221; and we all log out. Initially we were all jumping around with excitement thinking, oh shit, something is about to go DOWN. I thought about trying to blend back in with their crowd, only to realize that I just signed the wall with my name. &amp;#8220;The Jig is up guys,&amp;#8221; I said, and we started thinking of ways to get out. Our thoughts quickly turned to horror as we realized that if they covered the ground in lava, all our work would have been for nothing. It was around this time that Melkor signed on, on his own, new account, Enigma937. We rushed him over here to check out where everyone was, and apparently he drew quite the attention to himself, even getting himself camped on a frozen lake. At this point it was much more than the first person, now there were about 4 enemies roaming around in full diamond, while we at best had some stolen iron armor. Shadow valiantly died logging in to see if it was safe or not, he was the one that found out how many of them were on. His death gave them tons of TNT (I think?), but that didn&amp;#8217;t matter because all the valuables were on Brother_Snake. We found out that kstalawl had died earlier due to skype alt-tabbing him from the game during combat, so me and snake were the only ones left. As Melkor got himself camped on top of the lake, it gave us enough of a gap to spawn without being attacked. &amp;#8220;What do we do?&amp;#8221; Thoughts raced through our minds as we tried to think how the fuck we were gonna get out, with the only exit being guarded by 4 guys in full diamond. &amp;#8220;Dig into the wall!&amp;#8221; I told Brother_Snake, and he started digging a long escape tunnel. The remaining 8 TNT blocks I had I placed right outside the entrance of the tunnel. About 15 blocks into the tunnel, another enemy logged in, inside the base. As in, right next to us, 5 blocks from me. &amp;#8220;FUCK!!&amp;#8221; I shouted as I hurriedly covered up the tunnel entrance. In my squalor I covered up only the bottom half of it, and I forgot to light the TNT and now couldn&amp;#8217;t reach it. The new enemy was curious, and looked into the tunnel, but I quickly unloaded a volley of arrows into his face which scared him off, giving me enough time to break the blocks, light the TNT, and retreat back into the tunnel. The TNT blew up, the guy disappeared. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if he logged out, or if he was taken out by it. Almost perfectly, the explosion, which was so close to the entrance of the tunnel, broke the ceiling which revealed a lava flow, which perfectly covered our cave entrance so they couldn&amp;#8217;t even see where we went. After digging a whole ton we were close to the surface, holding shift so we didn&amp;#8217;t get spotted. We could literally see their names on the land above us, probably from seeing me while I was typing and not holding shift. Eventually, we got away while they went off to search another area, we booked it in the opposite direction, and after walking 1000, blocks, we logged off with our newfound loot. We took everything out of the proxy chests, and as a posse went far, far away to make our next base.

Good game guys, all I can say. Just so you know how good of a game that was, I just spent 2 hours writing 4,000 word story on it. Please post if there&#39;s something I forgot, this whole thing is from my perspective and I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be interesting if you post some things from yours that I may not know about. Feel free to correct my on anything, I may have said that was wrong.
PS: I&#39;d love to play TF2 with you guys sometime. Guess what my favorite class is?

But it&#39;s totally worth it:v:

Okay so where do I begin&amp;#8230; This is the tale of the week-long endeavor my group had with Freak472&amp;#8217;s group. It involves sabotage, betrayal, espionage, straight up slaughter, and gratuitous amounts of dynamite. Get ready for a hefty read, because this was about the coolest thing I&amp;#8217;ve ever done in minecraft so I&amp;#8217;m not gonna spare any detail.

So, first let me introduce my group. It consists of:
Parcec: Me
Enigma937: Melkor (FP member)
Original_Ganker: Accomplice, pro at redstone circuits
Brother_Snake: Accomplice, pro at building bases
Shadowkiller: Accomplice, builds bases with Brother_Snake, explores a lot
Kstalawl: Originally Melkor, later this was someone else, I&amp;#8217;ll go into detail later.

We are all friends IRL, so we don&amp;#8217;t worry about espionage, and we always talk on skype when we play, it&amp;#8217;s nice not having to type to each other. 

The other group consisted of 6(?) people, sorry I don&#39;t know all of you, I only really interacted with, Freak472, chaoslink23, Toothycat, and Godilla101.
I&amp;#8217;ll skip the boring bits of our first base, and simply start the story the day this whole thing began, when the server came back up as 1.7.2, and everyone found out you could dupe again. At this point, our base was already fully built, pics of it were already up on facepunch: 
[quote][img]http://gyazo.com/7ad75eb55d09de3f28b92929b9b3c935.png[/img][/quote]
We started out the day by gathering up or 2 sticky pistons, and trying to dupe them. The tricky part was that the SP method involved 3 sticky pistons, one for the clock, one for the piston, and one used as a dupe. The standard repeater clock method didn&amp;#8217;t work because the server was lagging. After a bit of panicking, Original_Ganker easily solved this problem by manually flipping a lever back and forth really fast, which, as luck may have it, gave us a third piston, letting us get our duping setup. We duped a little bit, and after a while I started getting perfectionst and tried to set up multiple lanes of dupers powered by a single clock for maximum efficiency. To test this out, Ganker put down dynamite in the duper. It was working fine, except when the dynamite travelled a few blocks, and hit an unfortunately placed redstone torch. The whole place exploded, I had to walk back from spawn, that&amp;#8217;s when I made this post:
[quote][img]http://gyazo.com/9dcfa8431fbe34f0f5360bca7c0542fe.png[/img][/quote]
Keep this image in mind for later.

This is where all the action began. Melkor, who was playing as kstalawl at the time, was wandering outside the base at the time, when he saw a name. Seeing enemy players was very, very rare for us, so he followed it and found more people there. He called over Ganker to his location, who brought him full diamond armor, and they contemplated going in. I told them &amp;#8220;Wait, it could be an FP base!&amp;#8221; To which they replied they didn&amp;#8217;t recognize any names, so I just said &amp;#8216;go ahead&amp;#8217; and they jumped in from the ceiling, slaughtering everyone in the base. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure Melkor in his fury killed Ganker on accident, who respawned at our base and got back to mining duped items. The whole time I was working on getting a better duping setup going, which I did, and Ganker went AFK gathering hundreds of TNT blocks. We soon started pumping out everything you can imagine, Diamond, Iron, Gold, and TNT blocks. Original_Ganker had to go so he sat AFK collecting hundreds of dynamite blocks. After a little bit of stockpiling, we felt like we ruled the server. Yet, the novelty soon began to wear off as we realized that it&amp;#8217;s pretty boring playing the game when you&amp;#8217;re horrendously overpowered. In the meantime, I was watching the chat unfold, as the entire party we just raided flipped out when Melkor revealed their coordinates in the server chat. A distinctive &amp;#8220;NOOOOOOO&amp;#8221; was heard from one of their gang. Looking to utilize some of our newly found TNT, he filled their base with it and detonated it, leaving nothing for them to return to. He then returned to our base, and I left to eat dinner.

Fast forward two hours. I come back to see a skype message saying &amp;#8220;FUCK DUDE THEY FOUND OUR BASE.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;WERE FUCKED MAN THEY GOT IT ALL.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;shit.&amp;#8221; I join the call and log on to see what the fuck is going on. To my surprise, I log in to see someone wearing no armor staring back at me. Piece of cake I think, and I start attacking him. In an attempt to get away he jumps down into a giant ravine that was built all around our base, all the way down to bedrock, which was meant to be filled with lava. I followed him into it and proceeded to attack, only to be suddenly struck from behind by someone else in full diamond, so in a panic I logged out. Fast forward a couple minutes, I log back in and make my way back up to our base. Melkor assures me that the coast is safe, as he&amp;#8217;s been tracking them to a big wall a few hundred blocks from our base. (By the way guys, we built that wall. That was all the cobble we got from digging all the way to bedrock. If we had more time it would have gone all the way to the other side where there was water.) Using this time, I gather up anything of value we have left in our base, and dump it into a chest under a tree. I make another chest on the other side, and while I&amp;#8217;m looking through what to put into it I notice 3 guys in full diamond rushing right at me. Knowing those exposed chests were our only chance of surviving, I lead these guys into the desert, desperately trying to get away. I had a bow, but unfortunately, had put the arrows in the chest without thinking. Had I had those arrows, this entire adventure would have been averted, because I was only being chased by people with melee swords. As I led this gang away from our base, I was shouting at Melkor over Skype to cover up the chests. Eventually, Melkor did do so, but he only covered up one, not seeing the other because it was dark. Melkor died and my other friend shadow logged on, who tried to grab anything he could out of the base and made it out without them noticing. While Melkor was walking back from spawn shadow observed that the gang was camping where I last logged off, with wolves, and apparently surrounded me in a building. At this point Melkor had to go for a bit, and I was stuck without an account, so I hopped on to Kstalawl and decided to check out what was going on. I logged in just in time to see someone ask in chat, &amp;#8220;Does anyone know who Parcec is?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;IDK lol&amp;#8221; I answered, only to see their gang say &amp;#8220;I thought he was with you&amp;#8221; To which I answered, &amp;#8220;Nah lol, he&amp;#8217;s not with us&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Us?&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Me and Original_Ganker&amp;#8221; I replied, thinking they killed him when he was AFKing. (I don&amp;#8217;t know if they did, to this day) It was that brief conversation with them that started the whole espionage act that I played throughout the next week. 

Look what they did to my baby :(
[QUOTE=halofreak472;31168251][img]http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/6935/itdead.png[/img][/QUOTE]

We all kinda logged off, and hopped on a few hours later. To my surprise, I logged in to find no-one camping me, and on close inspection I found a slimeball on top of the structure (I have no Idea why it was there). I brought this slimeball back to our small new base that Shadow and Brother_Snake were already working on, and created our only sticky piston. It was useless without a second one however. Figuring that our only hope rather than starting everything from scratch was tracking these guys down, I decided to try my best to convince them I was not allied with Original_Ganker and kstalawl. The basic story went that the base was mine, Ganker and kstalawl blew up their base, and then settled in mine, thinking it was abandoned, but I was really logged off. When I logged back on I was surprised by the guy infront of me, so I instinctively attacked him, considering he was an intruder in my base. At least, that was the story we were going to use. Recognizing the name Freak, I thought he was from FP (Half the server is from FP). Ends up the user I actually confused him for was FreakyMe, regardless, as luck would have it, a quick google search revealed my that Freak472 was indeed a facepuncher. I explained to my version of what happened, used my 2006 joindate and goldmembership as leverage; and, figuring he frequented this thread often, decided to remind him about my recent Anti-Hacking Rant (shown below) to set an image of myself as a sort of &amp;#8216;white knight&amp;#8217;. 

[QUOTE=FunnyBunny;31122247]I don&#39;t see how any of you could possibly suggest that flying is a good idea on this server. Maybe on a building server, but this isn&#39;t one, this is a 1 man vs. the world server. There&#39;s combat involved. How the fuck would combat work if one person was walking while another person could zoom by from the air raining down volleys of arrows on him? Say what you will about anarchy, but that is complete bullshit and makes the game not fun for anyone. The people that play the game legit are being destroyed, and the people that hack are not even getting a challenge. What&#39;s the point of playing the game if anyone you pass you can kill with ease?

I never got why people used flyhacks to get really far away from spawn. For every block out you go, the area that you can explore gets exponentially bigger. (5 blocks out there&#39;s a total of 25 blocks, 10 blocks out there&#39;s 100, etc, I&#39;m sure you get simple math) This means that at 100,000 blocks out the chances of finding anyone&#39;s base is microscopic at best, nor are you at risk of your own base getting griefed. So what&#39;s the point? What&#39;s the difference between playing 100,000 blocks out on this server, or playing on your own singleplayer game? Surely it&#39;s easier to build in a single player server, or at least your own small mp server, where the lag isn&#39;t nearly as crippling? So why do you do it then? Is it so that you can tell everyone that you&#39;re some crazy distance like 200,000 blocks out and expect someone to look at you in awe and admire you or something? Because that&#39;s not how we look at you, at all. We look at you as the asshole that lags up our server and causes housemaster to bring it down, completely. Let me remind you that the reason none of us have played on it for the last few days was because of everyone that was using flyhacks. Honestly, why do you fly? I truly don&#39;t understand, please, explain it to me. There&#39;s no bases to loot out there, building a base there is practically the same as building it in SP except with crippling server lag. Why do you fly?

Also all the X-Ray people. At least this one has a purpose. With an X-Ray hack you can easily find hidden bases and loot them to quickly become rich, saving you hours of work. I get that. But why use it when it ruins the whole fun of the entire server. For example, my base has a rather intricate entrance system that looks like an average mountain but comes apart to be an entrance to the base. I think it&#39;s cool because of all the work that was put into it. (sticky pistons aren&#39;t cheap, those guys are harder to acquire than diamonds) I think that when someone does actually stumble apon the system completely by accident, they&#39;d be really impressed, and would enter to see a quite established base with plenty to loot. But what&#39;s the point of making cool hidden entrances when you can just X-Ray chests and figure out exactly where my base is? You&#39;re ruining the whole experience of living on the edge by building your base moderately close to the top, and camouflaging it really well so that average passerby&#39;s don&#39;t notice it and mistake it for another mountain. The only way we can protect ourselves from X-Ray hacks is by building all our bases at bedrock and hoping that it&#39;s too far away for you to see the chests.

I know you guys try to justify this stuff by &#39;Anarchy server&#39; but honestly, there&#39;s a difference between anarchy and being a total asshat. Like someone&#39;s already said, the game should be played as anarchy, but within the game&#39;s limits. Not anarchy as in use any 3rd party program you want, go wild. Using hacks you&#39;re totally ruining the fun of everybody on the server, whether it be the immense lag, server being shut down, or pillaging bases. And I know what you&#39;re gonna say, &quot;No one is supposed to enjoy being looted!&quot; There&#39;s a difference between looting someone&#39;s base and what you&#39;re doing. When you loot someone&#39;s base, steal all their valubles, drop lava everywhere and leave a sign saying &quot;HIDE YOUR BASE BETTER FAGGOT&quot;, the person gets mad for a second, and then realizes that&#39;s the risk of playing this game. They accepted the risk when they started the game, and when it happened to them, well, all it teaches them is to hide their base better. When you use hacks you aren&#39;t playing anarchy, you&#39;re literally ruining the game for everyone else. When you loot a base you didn&#39;t do it legitimately, you did it by cheating. We can keep arguing about this in minecraft, but let me give you an example in real world terms. Say you&#39;re playing poker. When you play a hand, you&#39;re living on the edge, you know the risks, and rewards. That&#39;s how it would be like if everyone is playing the game the way it was meant to be played. When someone hacks, that&#39;s the equivalent of playing poker with someone who has an ace up their sleve. Face it, you guys know it&#39;s bullshit, you&#39;re all just in denial about it and think that just because it&#39;s an anarchy server and I won&#39;t get banned for it, I can do what I want without regard for anyone else&#39;s enjoyment.

That&#39;s all I have to say on the matter.

Polly brought up a good point. The only time I think it&#39;s ever acceptable to fly is when you&#39;re building something on the ceiling of your base and you don&#39;t want to spend time building scaffolding or vertical columns every 5 blocks. But that&#39;s about it.[/QUOTE]

At first, they were really shady, hardly replying to any private messages, so I was worried that they saw through my scheme. (My story was full of holes. If you had actually gone back to look through my posts in this thread, I constantly refer to me and a group of people, rather than me alone. Another example, go back to the picture of the duper gone wrong. There&#39;s another person in full diamond. This picture was taken roughly the same time we first attacked their base!) All those reasons, along with the fact that they had all of &amp;#8216;my&amp;#8217; items made them feel sorry/trustworthy enough to give me their coordinates, which was about 8k blocks from spawn. Well fuck I thought, considering my own cords of hardly 1,000 blocks away. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s our only hope&amp;#8221;, I thought to myself as I set out on the journey. I managed to survive and keep our gangs only set of diamond tools/armor, which helped me survive the 7,000 block journey. When I was within 500 blocks, I got a PM from Freak asking where I was, so I replied, &amp;#8220;Close&amp;#8221;. Less than a minute after, Toothycat, a member of their gang, said in chat &amp;#8220;LOL Parcec&amp;#8221;. My heart skipped a beat, as the thought that I walked all that space for nothing crossed my mind. Oh well, I&amp;#8217;ll walk the remaining 500 blocks and we&amp;#8217;ll see. To my surprise, I saw diamond wearing people walking around a frozen lake. I planned to set up a secret bed in a mountain before I went up to them, but Freak saw me and invited me over into their group. I was afraid that I might get ganged up on and killed, but to my surprise, I was let right into their tiny hiding hole, where I saw another sticky piston, wired up to a redstone repeater clock that I couldn&amp;#8217;t get working. (again) Noticing the lack of loot in the chests, I asked them where everything was, to which they replied that there was another guy, Godilla101, who was behind a few thousand blocks, that&amp;#8217;s the reason they had to stop, to wait for him to catch up. According to them, he had all sorts of diamond blocks, sticky pistons, you name it. The reason they couldn&amp;#8217;t get the duplicator working is because they also only had one sticky piston. The original plan was to steal their stuff, but realizing they could easily rebuild with Godilla&amp;#8217;s help, we decided it was best to wait. Their whole remaining gang went to sleep really early, and basically left me alone in the base. 

This was our chance. We decided we were going to march our sticky piston down to their sticky piston, dupe it, and start our own base of operations. The plan was brilliant. Ganker and Melkor set off, and I crafted some diamond armor sets and some stews and went to meet them in the middle. The rendezvous was a success, the piston arrived intact, and soon we were all armored up and ready to go. On the way back to their base we killed a few creepers and got 5 gunpowder, enough to make a TNT that we could dupe. At their base, Ganker used the same manual-flicky-switch method to dupe a single sticky piston, which let us create a working clock, and have an effective duper. We duped tons of sticky pistons, tons of iron, gold, diamond; we even carefully replaced the diamond back to 44 blocks, where it was before I even touched it.  When we were ready to leave we returned the duper back to its crippled mode, the only difference being it was slid over one block so that the piston clock would fit. Someone had noticed this the next day, but I simply explained to them that I was just fiddling with it trying to get it to work.  After we left the base, we walked 500 blocks, made a proxy base in the mountains, duped a bit more, made a secret stash (just incase), and logged off. 

The next day I wake up, get on and see the skype message &amp;#8220;Fuck I think they fixed duping &amp;#8211; Original_Ganker&amp;#8221;. The new Bukkit build came out and the server was finally updated. That meant no more fucking around, shit got real, no more infinite resources. We realized that we really didn&amp;#8217;t get to dupe that many things the night before, and that our only real option was to steal our original stuff back from them. To start the day Ganker and Melkor brought the recently duped resources back to our actual base at z=~2000, while I headed out to their base at around z=~8500. As I approached their base I got the same shady business, people not responding to my messeges, I thought they had abandoned me, yet, after 10 minutes, the same exact thing happened, someone came out and let me in the base. This time the base was at bedrock, and by the time I got there it was fairly set up, with an incinerator, a furnace room, a farm, mushroom farm, and a very thoroughly stocked food room filled with tons of mushroom stew. (They were all our mushrooms, Melkor was walking in the nether and found a patch of land with like 500 mushrooms, which he brought back to our original base). To make myself seem like a productive member, I quickly started working on a larger farm (Totally useless, small farm was more than enough, the big farm wasn&amp;#8217;t even finished) But while digging, I stumbled on a hidden chest. I quickly covered it up, but a few seconds later went back and checked it out. It had a hefty amount of diamond, among other things. I tried to cover it up, but someone had already saw me looking. &amp;#8220;Found this totally by accident lol&amp;#8221; I said, and I received a sarcastic sounding &amp;#8220;Uhuh&amp;#8221; from chaoslink. Just beyond this hidden chest I found another, with a few more nice items, and while digging around I found 3 gold blocks hidden behind the announcement board. This, along with a secret room I discovered later, pretty much taught me one thing. This base has a fuckton of secrets.

Throughout the following week I exchanged several facepunch PM&amp;#8217;s with Freak, where he revealed that he trusted me a lot more than I thought he did. He also conscripted me to build some traps, which I took from one of their designs, which I enjoyed because it improved my redstone abilities; as well as that was the place where I learned how to make quite possibly the best trap I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen. (The main premise is you&amp;#8217;re walking down a crude, poorly lit smoothstone stairway, and you step on a pressure plate. All of a sudden the wall a few blocks ahead pops out, and the step just before that retracts, so your momentum basically carries you into this freshly revealed lava pit.) While all this is going down, my squad&amp;#8217;s main base got raided, so all diamonds and iron left for us to use was the handful in the hidden cache. It soon became obvious that my little subterfuge plan HAD to succeed.

Now, at first, cooperating with these guys and earning their trust, I actually started to feel bad that I was about to steal everything. And that would have continued, except weird shit started happening at the base. First of all, it kept getting more and more secretive. Diamonds kept disappearing, hidden chests that were previously there were now gone. That, along with the fact that no one of their gang was on anymore was starting to get to me. The original plan was to have my whole squad surprise them in their base. They would have used my espionage to destroy their beds, so when they died they&amp;#8217;d be back at spawn. The plan was to have a sword, bow, full diamond, and a ton of slots filled with stew so that we&amp;#8217;d be prepared to take them on. Except, we ran into a couple problems. First of all, we had no diamond. All of our diamond had been jacked, except for the very little remaining which was made into tools. I had no diamond except for some tools, the enemy base I was in had gotten to the point where there was no diamond to be found. We could never get any of them on the server when we were on, and to make matters worse, my videocard died so I could only rarely play when I came over to someone&amp;#8217;s house. We weren&amp;#8217;t equipped to take them on at all. So I came over to a friends house today, and It was decided that, &amp;#8216;Fuck it, we&amp;#8217;re gonna do this now&amp;#8217;. We were logging in throughout the day, but no one was in the base. I gathered up all the items from the chests and put them all in the stockroom, organized by what was most important. We built a few hidden chests well outside their base, and shoved some stuff in there that we didn&amp;#8217;t want clogging our inventory. Now this is where the fun part begins.

We had 80 TNT, so we split it evenly between me, Shadow, and Brother_Snake, and we started tearing apart the base. The goal wasn&amp;#8217;t to be assholes. We were stripmining their base to look for chests. We did this carefully, one block at a time, so as to not destroy the chest itself. This payed off as we discovered a hidden chest with some nice goods in it, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t what we wanted. Sometime around here, kstalawl joined us, the real one, not Melkor. We kept detonating all over the base, until literally nothing was left, but then finally, in a stroke of luck Brother_Snake found one more hidden chest. We opened it and, Jackpot. Everything. Over 200 blocks of diamond, blocks of gold, Iron, practically everything they had. Our fears that they had it all in their inventories were extinguished when we found this chest. Brother_Snake piled it all in his inventory, and just before we were about to leave, we decided to utilize all their signs they had lying around their base and leave a commemoratory plaque. I wrote a rather rude note, sorry about that, I was kind of power high after realizing what we had accomplished. After reading it, everyone chuckled, and I put up another plaque next to it, &amp;#8220;-Signed, Funnybunny&amp;#8221;. Not 15 seconds after I placed this plaque I head over skype &amp;#8220;SHIT SOMEONE&amp;#8217;S HERE, LOG!&amp;#8221; and we all log out. Initially we were all jumping around with excitement thinking, oh shit, something is about to go DOWN. I thought about trying to blend back in with their crowd, only to realize that I just signed the wall with my name. &amp;#8220;The Jig is up guys,&amp;#8221; I said, and we started thinking of ways to get out. Our thoughts quickly turned to horror as we realized that if they covered the ground in lava, all our work would have been for nothing. It was around this time that Melkor signed on, on his own, new account, Enigma937. We rushed him over here to check out where everyone was, and apparently he drew quite the attention to himself, even getting himself camped on a frozen lake. At this point it was much more than the first person, now there were about 4 enemies roaming around in full diamond, while we at best had some stolen iron armor. Shadow valiantly died logging in to see if it was safe or not, he was the one that found out how many of them were on. His death gave them tons of TNT (I think?), but that didn&amp;#8217;t matter because all the valuables were on Brother_Snake. We found out that kstalawl had died earlier due to skype alt-tabbing him from the game during combat, so me and snake were the only ones left. As Melkor got himself camped on top of the lake, it gave us enough of a gap to spawn without being attacked. &amp;#8220;What do we do?&amp;#8221; Thoughts raced through our minds as we tried to think how the fuck we were gonna get out, with the only exit being guarded by 4 guys in full diamond. &amp;#8220;Dig into the wall!&amp;#8221; I told Brother_Snake, and he started digging a long escape tunnel. The remaining 8 TNT blocks I had I placed right outside the entrance of the tunnel. About 15 blocks into the tunnel, another enemy logged in, inside the base. As in, right next to us, 5 blocks from me. &amp;#8220;FUCK!!&amp;#8221; I shouted as I hurriedly covered up the tunnel entrance. In my squalor I covered up only the bottom half of it, and I forgot to light the TNT and now couldn&amp;#8217;t reach it. The new enemy was curious, and looked into the tunnel, but I quickly unloaded a volley of arrows into his face which scared him off, giving me enough time to break the blocks, light the TNT, and retreat back into the tunnel. The TNT blew up, the guy disappeared. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if he logged out, or if he was taken out by it. Almost perfectly, the explosion, which was so close to the entrance of the tunnel, broke the ceiling which revealed a lava flow, which perfectly covered our cave entrance so they couldn&amp;#8217;t even see where we went. After digging a whole ton we were close to the surface, holding shift so we didn&amp;#8217;t get spotted. We could literally see their names on the land above us, probably from seeing me while I was typing and not holding shift. Eventually, we got away while they went off to search another area, we booked it in the opposite direction, and after walking 1000, blocks, we logged off with our newfound loot. We took everything out of the proxy chests, and as a posse went far, far away to make our next base.

Good game guys, all I can say. Just so you know how good of a game that was, I just spent 2 hours writing 4,000 word story on it. Please post if there&#39;s something I forgot, this whole thing is from my perspective and I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be interesting if you post some things from yours that I may not know about. Feel free to correct my on anything, I may have said that was wrong.
PS: I&#39;d love to play TF2 with you guys sometime. Guess what my favorite class is?
