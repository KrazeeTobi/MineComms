Found this base at x: 2816, z: 27. I left Diamond. I took coal and cobblestone out of the chest and used them to make torches and fix holes. It&#39;s far from pretty but the base is pretty much liveable for the next person to come along. I&#39;d usually destroy shit like this and be on my merry way, but this seemed....special :v:[/QUOTE]

So I waited outside our base for him to log in, and when he did I snuck into the house and destroyed his bed. He was still outside farming and didn&#39;t notice I was there, so I took out my diamond sword, went around to the top of the hill overlooking our farm, and jumped down and killed him in one hit.

I was worried maybe he had seen me, but was relieved to see him type in chat a minute later &quot;Did someone kill me?&quot;. Our base is only a couple k out from spawn, but it was night so I figured I had enough time to set up a couple of traps and get out before he got back. I set up a landmine under the door very quickly, but then I decided I didn&#39;t want to leave until I had placed a lava trap in our house. Our house was 2 stories and made of wood, so I started making a cage of lava on the second story ceiling with a piston/pressure plate setup to send the lava pouring in when he walked upstairs. 

I was just about finished (all I had to do was put the lava in) when he comes back to the base way earlier than I expected. Apparently he walked there through the night even though he had no weapon. So he walks in the door and I&#39;m standing there deer in headlights, holding the diamond sword I just used to kill him. All he says is &quot;Oh hey&quot; and then proceeds to activate my landmine (but survived). I was totally shocked during all of this but I decided to act like I had just logged on seconds ago, and he bought it, telling me the story of some mystery guy who killed him just a few minutes ago and put a landmine in the house.

So I went along with it, and helped him rebuild the blown up floor I was responsible for. The next day I decided I wasn&#39;t through with him, so I decided to finish the lava trap. I did so without him seeing me, and sure enough he walked upstairs and activated it a couple minutes later.

He immediately assumed this was also the work of the mystery assailant. Watching that house burn down was more beautiful than all the sunsets I&#39;ve witnessed in this game. I&#39;m still with the guy and he&#39;s none the wiser, what should I do next? And yes I know I&#39;m an asshole but it&#39;s the whole fun of this server."

So I waited outside our base for him to log in, and when he did I snuck into the house and destroyed his bed. He was still outside farming and didn&#39;t notice I was there, so I took out my diamond sword, went around to the top of the hill overlooking our farm, and jumped down and killed him in one hit.

I was worried maybe he had seen me, but was relieved to see him type in chat a minute later &quot;Did someone kill me?&quot;. Our base is only a couple k out from spawn, but it was night so I figured I had enough time to set up a couple of traps and get out before he got back. I set up a landmine under the door very quickly, but then I decided I didn&#39;t want to leave until I had placed a lava trap in our house. Our house was 2 stories and made of wood, so I started making a cage of lava on the second story ceiling with a piston/pressure plate setup to send the lava pouring in when he walked upstairs. 

I was just about finished (all I had to do was put the lava in) when he comes back to the base way earlier than I expected. Apparently he walked there through the night even though he had no weapon. So he walks in the door and I&#39;m standing there deer in headlights, holding the diamond sword I just used to kill him. All he says is &quot;Oh hey&quot; and then proceeds to activate my landmine (but survived). I was totally shocked during all of this but I decided to act like I had just logged on seconds ago, and he bought it, telling me the story of some mystery guy who killed him just a few minutes ago and put a landmine in the house.

So I went along with it, and helped him rebuild the blown up floor I was responsible for. The next day I decided I wasn&#39;t through with him, so I decided to finish the lava trap. I did so without him seeing me, and sure enough he walked upstairs and activated it a couple minutes later.

He immediately assumed this was also the work of the mystery assailant. Watching that house burn down was more beautiful than all the sunsets I&#39;ve witnessed in this game.

String him along, use him as a pack mule and make him mine shit for you when you start a base. After all, a manservant could be useful. Never trust him with the valuables though, keep them with you at all times. Make sure to be very far out too, because if you ever need to kill him(which you will) you must be a safe distance away before he comes back. Also don&#39;t put a whole lot of effort into anything because once you murder him he will give everyone your coords and try to murder you.

On an unrelated note I went on my first raid and came out with a ton of magenta wool, ~20 slimeballs, and two sticky pistons."
