wat

the reason its POSSIBLE for a map restart is because there&#39;s a bug with the version 

if the maps too big there&#39;s multiple choices

if there&#39;s a bug in the version and how long the map has been up we&#39;d PROBABLY have to wait for an update/map restart</span>

i agree , and this happend to me several times, BUT its pretty much empty untill atleast 20k, and no new players are staying so all the ruins pretty much stay forgotten.
 Base that do get destroyed now, like mine which is about 100k about will mostlikely not been seen by anybody. Because its just to far for them to walk there."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Agree;34028894]The server should NOT shut down, the passage of time will continue, so what if a base with a lot of people in it got blasted the glory of this server is the hundreds of thousands of minutes spent by hundreds of dedicated players, building and destroying bases. Just recently we integrated 2 people into our village a few days after their village got raided, their constructions that hours were spent working on got destroyed, but when they came to our village they worked on building massive buildings and amazing constructions that put half of the things that we made to shame, their effort shows that those 2 builders had more desire to build than most of those in our village, and I am jealous of what they have made. I saw their destroyed base, in its shambles, TNT holes in walls and walkways Glowstone and Lapis Lazuli removed from walls, lava everywhere, it was horrifying. But I know that I, and anyone else who happens to come across that slab of land in the next year(s) that the server exists will be awestruck with what is there, and they, even through the destruction, will be able to see through the damage and see the grandeur of that which once was. It&#39;s a shame to see something that amazing get blown to shreds, instead of just looted for the goodies that were inside, like anyone with a heart (adjusted for 2b2t) would do, but still, seeing them man up after the destruction and move on and continue building shows what makes this server so great, and why it SHOULD NOT EVER RESET. The constant creation of a world throughout the passage of time, a whole year as a timeline for constant discovery and creation. So Cheers, to the two builders, kep and jake, Glad to have you in our village, and I&#39;m glad to be a part of 2b2t, what it is, and what it has been, and what it will be in the future.[/QUOTE]

If you want a map restart go play on some build server with a great community, good admins, no cussing, no griefing, no PVP, no stealing and have all the 300 plugins you want.

If you want 2b2t then you&#39;re gonna get the full 75GB world with unbearable lag, epic ruins, great loot and the greatest minecraft community in the history of fucking forever. If it weren&#39;t for the world it has, 2b2t wouldn&#39;t be what it is. Face it, if the world were to be restarted, the only thing that would happen would be unbearable lag for about a week to two weeks while people go so far as fuck out, the spawn is virtually left alone and all the cool ruins don&#39;t exist. We would just fall back into the ranks of the &quot;nothing special servers&quot; and people like you are ones supporting the server&#39;s ruin.

S.T.O.P

If you want a map restart go play on some build server with a great community, good admins, no cussing, no griefing, no PVP, no stealing and have all the 300 plugins you want.

If you want 2b2t then you&#39;re gonna get the full 75GB world with unbearable lag, epic ruins, great loot and the greatest minecraft community in the history of fucking forever. If it weren&#39;t for the world it has, 2b2t wouldn&#39;t be what it is. Face it, if the world were to be restarted, the only thing that would happen would be unbearable lag for about a week to two weeks while people go so far as fuck out, the spawn is virtually left alone and all the cool ruins don&#39;t exist. We would just fall back into the ranks of the &quot;nothing special servers&quot; and people like you are ones supporting the server&#39;s ruin.

Gonna say it once again for clarification...[b]Stop bitching about a restart.[/b][/QUOTE]
 
Actually if it were to restart all that would happen is the same thing that happened when 2b2t started off to begin with. What made 2b2t what it was was complete and total lack of moderation: Do what you want, when you want, to whomever you want, so if people really cared about the spirit of 2b2t that much, all resetting the map would do is cause many people to be butt-frustrated that everything they&#39;ve built is gone, and some time after, a new treasure-trove of raids and ruins will be born anew."
