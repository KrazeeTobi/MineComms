Ah sorry haha. If I&#39;d known that it was Facepunchers I would&#39;ve left it alone (or at least not devastate it like I did) You really should&#39;ve had something like a sign or something saying it&#39;s Facepunch.

And I have to give you props too. I liked the automated reed farm and the big quarries you guys had. Also the architecture wasn&#39;t too bad either. The hedge walls and swimming pool were nice too.

Sorry :v:

I enjoy building really awesome things, then once they&#39;re done return after awhile to see how its &#39;aged&#39;.

For example: My castle at 300x, 3000z was a magnificent sight. Tons of work went into it, though it was a bit small as far as castles go. I abandoned the place soon after completing it. When I returned, the place was in ruins with signs that people had settled at/near there... I.E. a GIANT castle surrounded by a lava wall. Even our underground &#39;proper&#39; shelter had signs that it was being used. I dunno, I get some sense of satisfaction in knowing that people will come a crossed these ruins and admire what it could&#39;ve been in their prime, and that it will essentially last forever, as most griefers won&#39;t bother to destroy every trace of a structure, but leave it in shambles.

That&#39;s why I enjoy 2b2t. Yeah, it kinda sucked that our settlement that Polly destroyed wasn&#39;t anywhere near finished. It, at the least, remains as a ruin that will be discovered months from now by someone else."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Chezhead;31497995]This server is pretty much just &quot;build something really cool and wait until it gets destroyed&quot; sort of thing. People build really cool houses and such, and just wait for someone to come along and demolish it. What&#39;s the fun in that?[/QUOTE]

I enjoy building really awesome things, then once they&#39;re done return after awhile to see how its &#39;aged&#39;.

For example: My castle at 300x, 3000z was a magnificent sight. Tons of work went into it, though it was a bit small as far as castles go. I abandoned the place soon after completing it. When I returned, the place was in ruins with signs that people had settled at/near there... I.E. a GIANT castle surrounded by a lava wall. Even our underground &#39;proper&#39; shelter had signs that it was being used. I dunno, I get some sense of satisfaction in knowing that people will come a crossed these ruins and admire what it could&#39;ve been in their prime, and that it will essentially last forever, as most griefers won&#39;t bother to destroy every trace of a structure, but leave it in shambles.

That&#39;s why I enjoy 2b2t. Yeah, it kinda sucked that our settlement that Polly destroyed wasn&#39;t anywhere near finished. It, at the least, remains as a ruin that will be discovered months from now by someone else.</span>
