We were playing on a private SMP server. The owners friend couldn&#39;t get in so we made it public, which solved the problem. Then a guy called Doridian (creator of MCadmin) comes in with a [DEV] tag. We didnt know he was a developer so we thought he was some hacker and banned him. 

Cut a long story short he shut down our server.

So my friend posted a thread on the minecraft forums ([url]http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1013&amp;t=66067[/url]) and people arent happy with this &quot;back door&quot; the developer had put into the game and alot of people are removing the mod from their server!

The reason I am hated is quite easy: I don&#39;t do what others tell me to, like &quot;cool&quot; people do. I am not cool, nor wanting to be.
And saying &quot;an implementation of VAC should not come from 3rd party&quot; seems quite weird to me. How does it differ if Notch does it from me doing it. ESPECIALLY since as I said you can disable the global banlist if you dislike my policies.

On the other hand, Apple has worse backdoors in Mac OS, and especially iPhone OS (they decide what you run and how you run it, they even got an App blacklist hardcoded into the kernel [it reads a webpage off an Apple webserver]).
Microsoft has backdoors into Windows, too, which would allow them to push everything they want onto you (atleast if they used Windows update to push their code, for example).

Also, I am quite sure Mozilla has hidden backdoors in Firefox, just like I am sure Google Chrome has hidden backdoors for Google.

Ofcourse obfuscation is no real security, but as soon as I found someone abusing the global ban system (by him finding a flaw which I don&#39;t hope which exists), I will instantly disable and fix it.
Thinking even Steam user ID tickets were hacked (you could play games as any other steam user with an app).

His justification

Does he not realise that not mentioning things that are in the product and maliciously using the unmentioned code  is illegal?"

The reason I am hated is quite easy: I don&#39;t do what others tell me to, like &quot;cool&quot; people do. I am not cool, nor wanting to be.
And saying &quot;an implementation of VAC should not come from 3rd party&quot; seems quite weird to me. How does it differ if Notch does it from me doing it. ESPECIALLY since as I said you can disable the global banlist if you dislike my policies.

On the other hand, Apple has worse backdoors in Mac OS, and especially iPhone OS (they decide what you run and how you run it, they even got an App blacklist hardcoded into the kernel [it reads a webpage off an Apple webserver]).
Microsoft has backdoors into Windows, too, which would allow them to push everything they want onto you (atleast if they used Windows update to push their code, for example).

Also, I am quite sure Mozilla has hidden backdoors in Firefox, just like I am sure Google Chrome has hidden backdoors for Google.

Ofcourse obfuscation is no real security, but as soon as I found someone abusing the global ban system (by him finding a flaw which I don&#39;t hope which exists), I will instantly disable and fix it.
Thinking even Steam user ID tickets were hacked (you could play games as any other steam user with an app).

As to the legality of this issue, here is an example of a Tennessee State statute on point.  Most states have a similar law.  

Tenn. Code Ann. 39-14-602(b)
Whoever intentionally and without authorization, directly or indirectly:
	
		     (1)  Accesses any computer, computer system, or computer network  commits a Class C misdemeanor. Operating a computer network in such a  way as to allow anonymous access to that network shall constitute  implicit consent to access under this part;

[And you border on this much more serious charge:]

(4)  Accesses, causes to be accessed, or attempts to access any computer  software, computer network, or any part thereof, for the purpose of  maliciously gaining access to computer material or to tamper maliciously  with computer security devices including, but not limited to, system  hackers, commits a Class A misdemeanor;[/quote]

Basically he is breaking the law in atleast one state.

The ability to remotely shut down someone stuff is unfair and I&#39;m sure there is a law against it somewhere. Imagine if Robin could get butthurt and shutdown tf2 servers like this guy and MC servers.
He would be in up to his ears in shit.

Stuff like this makes my over powerful sense of justice boil.[/QUOTE]
 
as said in the MC forums it&#39;s illegal in quite a lot of states</span>
