I have made a portal. This is because I want to go check out what hell is like. After I have explored hell enough, I will start a new world so I can get biomes and such.


Also I had a pretty close call with a creeper near my house:

You can&#39;t handle getting a simple backup creator for your server so that griefing isn&#39;t a problem anymore. People have posted links to them. They have given you all the resources. Maybe you just want the server to be griefed so that you can pretend to have a reason to delete the map. I once liked creating things on your server. I spent lots of time building, and even when I came back I made a few friends because I helped start off the new town that just sprung up because you forced everyone to start over again because a map full of beautiful cities is so dull compared to a completely untouched new map. You are so confusing, I don&#39;t even understand how you think. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll just go ahead and just agree that 13 year old server hosts don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. I didn&#39;t do anything wrong when I came back to your server. You build a community by having people who are attached to the landscapes they&#39;ve changed by building or mining. People are leaving because their shit keeps getting erased.

To everyone who still thinks guniv&#39;s server is something to invest your time in: Don&#39;t do it. He&#39;s already pointed out that after you&#39;ve spent a long time building your creation it is now &#39;dull&#39; and will be removed."

You can&#39;t handle getting a simple backup creator for your server so that griefing isn&#39;t a problem anymore. People have posted links to them. They have given you all the resources. Maybe you just want the server to be griefed so that you can pretend to have a reason to delete the map. I once liked creating things on your server. I spent lots of time building, and even when I came back I made a few friends because I helped start off the new town that just sprung up because you forced everyone to start over again because a map full of beautiful cities is so dull compared to a completely untouched new map. You are so confusing, I don&#39;t even understand how you think. That&#39;s why I&#39;ll just go ahead and just agree that 13 year old server hosts don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. I didn&#39;t do anything wrong when I came back to your server. You build a community by having people who are attached to the landscapes they&#39;ve changed by building or mining. People are leaving because their shit keeps getting erased.

To everyone who still thinks guniv&#39;s server is something to invest your time in: Don&#39;t do it. He&#39;s already pointed out that after you&#39;ve spent a long time building your creation it is now &#39;dull&#39; and will be removed.</span>

I would have to travel really far for those biomes. I&#39;d rather just have them right there.

I heard there&#39;s some third-party program that can be used to remove certain chunks. (therefore forcing them to be generated again) This would probably make biomes work just fine. I am considering doing that. If someone has a link to this program, I would like to have it.



Ok, now my plans have changed. I will remove all chunks except the ones in which my home is located. This should make biomes work nicely"

If you didn&#39;t do anything wrong, i&#39;m sorry, but after having you threaten to grief buildings in my facepunch group, I don&#39;t think i can trust you.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Guniv;25614652]i have a backup script; however there are many people on at once so if i go back to an old save after griefing, stuff will be lost. You helped with the new town before starting to TNT it all. and yes, most 13 year olds have no idea what they&#39;re doing, but i have a pretty good sense on running servers. If you didn&#39;t do anything wrong, i&#39;m sorry, but after having you threaten to grief buildings in my facepunch group, I don&#39;t think i can trust you. We had the last map for about a month before it got switched, and i gave everyone plenty warning that some kind of map switch would happen.

Oh man blowing up 1 bridge that took less than an hour to make is so much worse than deleting everything and calling people&#39;s pride and joy dull.

MEANWHILE GUNIV DOESN&#39;T REALIZE THAT HE&#39;S GRIEFING HIS OWN SERVER

and I wasn&#39;t talking about the town that you deleted 3 maps ago
