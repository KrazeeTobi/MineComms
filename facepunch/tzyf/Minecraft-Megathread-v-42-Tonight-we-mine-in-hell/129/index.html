We were playing on a private SMP server. The owners friend couldn&#39;t get in so we made it public, which solved the problem. Then a guy called Doridian (creator of MCadmin) comes in with a [DEV] tag. We didnt know he was a developer so we thought he was some hacker and banned him. 

Cut a long story short he shut down our server.

So my friend posted a thread on the minecraft forums ([url]http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1013&amp;t=66067[/url]) and people arent happy with this &quot;back door&quot; the developer had put into the game and alot of people are removing the mod from their server!

I too would advise anyone using MCadmin to use something else. The owner can manipulate your server in any way he sees fit.[/QUOTE]
 
Never use MCAdmin again. Try Hey0&#39;s Mod.

Now we know why people hate him.</span>
