[QUOTE]Part One: Waking Up In The Middle Of Nowhere

	I was laying facedown in a grassy plain when I awoke. I turned over and sat up, confused but awake. The sun loomed overhead, straight up in the sky like it was barely the afternoon. At first, I didn&#39;t know where I was. I looked around for some sign of civilization, but I found nothing. There was only grass, the sky, and myself. All around me there were trees. Not dense enough to be a forest, but getting close. Above the treeline I could see mountains and formations of all sorts of shapes and sizes. Getting a better look was impossible over the leaves, and I knew I&#39;d have to find my way out of them before nightfall or I&#39;d probably be lost for more than a little while. I could have wandered among them for hours, but going in one direction seemed to be the best idea, so I traveled what I assumed was North.

	After what seemed like an eternity, I found a clearing with few trees, and decided to take a rest there. Sitting down in the field, I  recalled everything I could remember about myself. My name was Zach. I had a wife and two children. I lived in a small town East of Notchguard. I couldn&#39;t recall how I got where I was nor why I was there in the first place. I fumbled through my pockets for my wallet. I pulled it out to find everything still in its place. Credit cards, a few gold coins, and my wife&#39;s picture. I also found a few small iron bars, just enough to smelt something small if I had some fire. That was all I must have taken with me, so it must have been a short trip to wherever I was going. I thought as hard as I could but nothing came to mind.

	A small rest later, I took another glance around. There was a small mountain which seemed climbable from where I was standing. I figured it&#39;d be a nice way to get a look around, so I started my ascent. There was little I had to do myself as most of the terrain was walkable, but here and there I had to displace a little dirt into makeshift stairs. As I neared the peak I noticed it was especially high up, almost to the clouds. It wasn&#39;t a very tall mountain, which meant the ground I was on before was elevated. I wasn&#39;t sure if it&#39;d be of any help to know that, but I kept it in mind. I reached the top in no time, and stood up, ignoring the wind that blew through my hair as I did so.

	A quick look over the scenery told me there was no getting rescued from wherever I was. There was forest in all directions, and on the edge of the horizon I could see water masses here and there. I thought I was on an island at first, but the lack of sand gave me other ideas. I looked from the edge of the cliff down to the forest below. There was a bit of crumbling on the highest point, right in front of a very steep drop, and below that, the clearing I&#39;d woken up in. It didn&#39;t take rocket science reasoning to figure that I&#39;d fallen from this peak at some point and hit my head.

	Before I had another spill, I descended back to ground level and considered my options. I could wait to get rescued, or go look for help myself. Since I appeared to be in the middle of nowhere, the former seemed unlikely, so I went with the latter and continued Northward. I had no way of knowing if I was going in the right direction to civilization, but I didn&#39;t have any other choice at the moment. By the time I&#39;d made a little headway, it&#39;d begun to get dark. There was lore around town about monsters and creatures of the night, and I didn&#39;t believe any of it, but then again, I&#39;d never been outside of the town walls at night. I wasn&#39;t going to take any chances, but I didn&#39;t have time or materials to build a shelter.

	As the sun set, I rifled through some nearby gravel and came up with a bit of flint, which, after some striking against some fallen logs and my iron bars, made a nicely sized fire to keep me warm and safe from any possible monsters. I would like to say I slept soundly, but admittedly I didn&#39;t sleep at all. I was busy thinking about what I was doing out in the wilderness and what I would do on the coming day.

	After a sleepless night, I was not prepared for moving again when the sun arose, so I fashioned a bucket from the little iron I had left, making use of the fire I&#39;d set the previous night. I wandered a little ways away from my still burning pile of logs before I came to a stream that flowed from horizon line to horizon line with no end in sight. I filled the bucket, brought it back to the fire, and boiled away any bad germs like I&#39;d seen on TV once.

	Letting the water cool down for a little while, I figured I&#39;d set up a makeshift home while I was here. I pried some wood off of the nearby trees and placed them in a large square around my fire. After setting up a perimeter, I grabbed a hefty stone off of the ground and used my fire to shape it into an axe. Using the few untouched stocks from the fire, I made some sort of ghetto caveman axe. Not the best, but it&#39;d do nicely. I cut down some of the surrounding trees, and after a bit of hard work and eye-to-fingers measuring, I&#39;d made a small house. Wiping the sweat from my brow, I exited the somewhat unsteady abode and glanced at the sun. It was exactly straight up from my standing position, which meant it was around noon.

	At that point, I realized my stomach was gurgling. I hadn&#39;t had anything to eat since I&#39;d woken up, which was a good 36 hours prior. I considered my options.  The local fauna of sheep and pigs had served me well back in my town, and I did have an axe on my person. With a shrug, I leapt at the nearest pig, and before I knew it, I was roasting some ham on a stick over my fire. With a full belly, I walked out of the house for a second time, trying to avoid the awkward glances from the still-thriving animals. I grabbed some more water before retreating for the safety of my home as the sun set.

	I slept soundly that night. I can remember my dream as clearly as any waking moment, or rather, nightmare. I was standing in a clearing much like the one I&#39;d woken up in. The sky was dark, but I could tell it was daytime. The clouds hung black and pregnant in the sky, about to rain acid any second. The trees around me were barren and scarred from some unseen fire. The grass I was sitting on when I awoke was now crumbling, loose dirt. In front of me was what appeared to be a giant lake of magma. It burned red hot as I neared it, and I could not stop staring in awe. It was unlike anything I&#39;d ever seen before.

	I heard someone clear their throat from somewhere behind me in the black mist. I turned, and the person I least expected to be there stood before me. Father Notch, the fabled creator of Notchguard, glared at me as if I had done something wrong. I tried to ask what I&#39;d done, but no sound came from my throat. I then realized I was dressed in diamond armor, with a diamond sword in my hand. I could have sworn I wasn&#39;t wearing it before. I glanced back up at Father Notch, but he was gone.

	Then, out of the fog came monsters. Tens, hundreds, maybe thousands in all directions. Green, four-legged creatures wobbled over, their stumpy legs barely supporting their large, rectangular bodies. I looked behind me in fear as I saw bare bone skeletons crawling their way out of the magma, fire still searing them to the marrow. There were spiders almost as large as my body scrambling for me. I readied my sword to fight them.

	Before I could even take a step, lightning cracked across the sky above, and suddenly it was raining. I opened my eyes. The roof of my hut had sprung a leak and was dripping slowly on my face. My fire&#39;d gone out, leaving me almost blind. I scrambled to light a torch with my flint but I couldn&#39;t find it. It was black, which meant it blended in with the darkness. Luckily, it was almost sunup, though it wouldn&#39;t be very bright thanks to the clouds.

	I would have spent the day inside thinking about my next move. I should have. Instead, I threw on my clothes and trudged out into the rain. I needed to get more wood to reinforce my home. I grabbed my axe from its spot lying against the house and hacked away at any tree I could find. I heard the burst of thunder from somewhere close by, but I ignored it. If I couldn&#39;t defend myself from whatever monsters were out there in the wasteland with a diamond sword, how would I if I had no weapons at all?

	I&#39;d always had an interest in the Armageddon. The holy book of code had always spoken of it. In fact, the last chapter of the book was about it. The preachers at the church paid no mind to it, calling the situation “many years off, far past any inhabitable life”. Well, I didn&#39;t want to believe this. Despite no interest in monster lore,  the idea had always intrigued me. The stories told of Father Notch raining hell upon his creations. The prophecy was that “the night when Mother Rana did not shine upon the land”. Mother Rana is the moon, and her not shining happened once every week as part of the moon cycle. It was no big surprise when I woke up the next morning, but I&#39;d always wondered if the next new moon would be the one to kill us all.

	Another part of the book told of a hero sent by Father Notch himself to save all of Notchguard and beyond with his strength. He was identifiable by, what else, but his diamond armor. The nightmare I&#39;d had the night before was exactly the apocalypse described in the book. I couldn&#39;t help but shudder at the thought of the world ending.

	As I felled a tree, I noticed a loose patch of gravel in a cliffside. It was as if the tree was concealing it. My house was a small dot on the horizon at this point, so I collected my logs and dug away at the gravel. Behind the gravel, there was a cave. Well, it was less of a cave and more of a hole. A very large one. I could hardly even see the bottom, a small speck. I didn&#39;t dare lean over farther, after my last fall I might not survive the next one. I could see a shimmering red liquid at the bottom of the pit, and I knew I&#39;d uncovered something horrible.

	The magma churned and rumbled far below me, echoing through the entire cavern. I could hear it fizzling and popping, and I could have sworn it was slowly getting louder. I&#39;d not only run into a cave, I&#39;d run into the peak of a volcano. The rain outside raged on as I watched below. Little did I know, I was not alone in the cave.

	I felt a pressure on my back, and before I knew what was happening, I was freefalling into the hole. With a yelp, I gripped the side for dear life and squeezed my eyes shut. Daring to open them, I could feel the heat of the fires below, blowing hot air into my face, almost lifting me off the ground. I looked up to see who my attacker was, and I saw something I never thought I&#39;d see outside of my dreams.

	It was one of the green four-legged creatures. It hissed at me and did nothing more. I stared into the deep holes where its eyes would be, horrified at what I was watching. It seemed to grow and shrink as it glanced around, possibly deciding what to do next with me. There was a small hole in the ceiling, which is where I assumed it came from. It hissed long and low, slowly getting louder, before it did the one thing I wasn&#39;t expecting it to do.

	It blew the fuck up.

	It threw me across the hole, sending me back first into the other side and then down into the hole. I wanted to say my whole life flashed before my eyes when I was falling, but I couldn&#39;t remember it worth a damn. I assumed all was lost. I looked around frantically for some way to escape my fate, some ledge to grab, some water to land in, but there was nothing but rock and heat. I spotted a small alcove, and gritted my teeth as I prepared to land on it.

	My feet hit the rocky surface hard, and I could feel my ankles breaking as I fell to the ground with a crunch. I was almost halfway down the hole now, and the heat was practically unbearable. It was so humid I could barely breathe, and I tried to sit up. I laid for what must have been a couple hours down there, just waiting for my legs to heal. That is definitely a plus about my people. We heal limbs if the strike isn&#39;t critical enough to kill you. It makes falling off of things less of a hazard, which is how I assumed I survived my cliff fall now that I think about it.

	After I could stand again on my own, I considered what to do from here. I was halfway down a hole, with the bottom filled with hot magma and the top far, far above and far, far too rocky to climb. I could have lost my cool, and I did when it reached about 100 degrees, but now I was used to the heat, and I could already tell I was sweating. I was almost halfway to what I assumed was the core of the Earth. Now I just had to get the hell out. I shielded my eyes with my hand and took a quick peak out over the ledge. The boiling hot magma was in fact rising. Slowly, sure, but that meant it would eventually reach the surface.

	I didn&#39;t have any other options. I&#39;d have to climb. And climb I did. For three whole hours, I climbed, and by the time I reached the top of the hole, I was scared half to death and exhausted at least &#190; to death. If I were a cat, I&#39;d have lost eight and a quarter lives during my climb. I wanted to lay down and just die right there, but I had to get back to my home. I stumbled out of the cave, not bothering to seal up the exit, wandered back to my home through the darkness and mushy dirt, lit a fire with my flint and planks, and fell flat on my face to sleep again.

	I slept soundly that night. I can remember my dream as clearly as any waking moment, or rather, nightmare. I was standing in a clearing much like the one I&#39;d woken up in. The sky was dark, but I could tell it was daytime. The clouds hung black and pregnant in the sky, about to rain acid any second. The trees around me were barren and scarred from some unseen fire. The grass I was sitting on when I awoke was now crumbling, loose dirt. In front of me was what appeared to be a giant lake of magma. It burned red hot as I neared it, and I could not stop staring in awe. It was unlike anything I&#39;d ever seen before.

	I heard someone clear their throat from somewhere behind me in the black mist. I turned, and the person I least expected to be there stood before me. Father Notch, the fabled creator of Notchguard, glared at me as if I had done something wrong. I tried to ask what I&#39;d done, but no sound came from my throat. I then realized I was dressed in diamond armor, with a diamond sword in my hand. I could have sworn I wasn&#39;t wearing it before. I glanced back up at Father Notch, but he was gone.

	Then, out of the fog came monsters. Tens, hundreds, maybe thousands in all directions. Green, four-legged creatures wobbled over, their stumpy legs barely supporting their large, rectangular bodies. I looked behind me in fear as I saw bare bone skeletons crawling their way out of the magma, fire still searing them to the marrow. There were spiders almost as large as my body scrambling for me. I readied my sword to fight them.

	Before I could even take a step, lightning cracked across the sky above, and suddenly it was raining. I opened my eyes. The roof of my hut had sprung a leak and was dripping slowly on my face. My fire&#39;d gone out, leaving me almost blind. I scrambled to light a torch with my flint but I couldn&#39;t find it. It was black, which meant it blended in with the darkness. Luckily, it was almost sunup, though it wouldn&#39;t be very bright thanks to the clouds.

	I would have spent the day inside thinking about my next move. I should have. Instead, I threw on my clothes and trudged out into the rain. I needed to get more wood to reinforce my home. I grabbed my axe from its spot lying against the house and hacked away at any tree I could find. I heard the burst of thunder from somewhere close by, but I ignored it. If I couldn&#39;t defend myself from whatever monsters were out there in the wasteland with a diamond sword, how would I if I had no weapons at all?

	I&#39;d always had an interest in the Armageddon. The holy book of code had always spoken of it. In fact, the last chapter of the book was about it. The preachers at the church paid no mind to it, calling the situation “many years off, far past any inhabitable life”. Well, I didn&#39;t want to believe this. Despite no interest in monster lore,  the idea had always intrigued me. The stories told of Father Notch raining hell upon his creations. The prophecy was that “the night when Mother Rana did not shine upon the land”. Mother Rana is the moon, and her not shining happened once every week as part of the moon cycle. It was no big surprise when I woke up the next morning, but I&#39;d always wondered if the next new moon would be the one to kill us all.

	Another part of the book told of a hero sent by Father Notch himself to save all of Notchguard and beyond with his strength. He was identifiable by, what else, but his diamond armor. The nightmare I&#39;d had the night before was exactly the apocalypse described in the book. I couldn&#39;t help but shudder at the thought of the world ending.

	As I felled a tree, I noticed a loose patch of gravel in a cliffside. It was as if the tree was concealing it. My house was a small dot on the horizon at this point, so I collected my logs and dug away at the gravel. Behind the gravel, there was a cave. Well, it was less of a cave and more of a hole. A very large one. I could hardly even see the bottom, a small speck. I didn&#39;t dare lean over farther, after my last fall I might not survive the next one. I could see a shimmering red liquid at the bottom of the pit, and I knew I&#39;d uncovered something horrible.

	The magma churned and rumbled far below me, echoing through the entire cavern. I could hear it fizzling and popping, and I could have sworn it was slowly getting louder. I&#39;d not only run into a cave, I&#39;d run into the peak of a volcano. The rain outside raged on as I watched below. Little did I know, I was not alone in the cave.

	I felt a pressure on my back, and before I knew what was happening, I was freefalling into the hole. With a yelp, I gripped the side for dear life and squeezed my eyes shut. Daring to open them, I could feel the heat of the fires below, blowing hot air into my face, almost lifting me off the ground. I looked up to see who my attacker was, and I saw something I never thought I&#39;d see outside of my dreams.

	It was one of the green four-legged creatures. It hissed at me and did nothing more. I stared into the deep holes where its eyes would be, horrified at what I was watching. It seemed to grow and shrink as it glanced around, possibly deciding what to do next with me. There was a small hole in the ceiling, which is where I assumed it came from. It hissed long and low, slowly getting louder, before it did the one thing I wasn&#39;t expecting it to do.

	It blew the fuck up.

	It threw me across the hole, sending me back first into the other side and then down into the hole. I wanted to say my whole life flashed before my eyes when I was falling, but I couldn&#39;t remember it worth a damn. I assumed all was lost. I looked around frantically for some way to escape my fate, some ledge to grab, some water to land in, but there was nothing but rock and heat. I spotted a small alcove, and gritted my teeth as I prepared to land on it.

	My feet hit the rocky surface hard, and I could feel my ankles breaking as I fell to the ground with a crunch. I was almost halfway down the hole now, and the heat was practically unbearable. It was so humid I could barely breathe, and I tried to sit up. I laid for what must have been a couple hours down there, just waiting for my legs to heal. That is definitely a plus about my people. We heal limbs if the strike isn&#39;t critical enough to kill you. It makes falling off of things less of a hazard, which is how I assumed I survived my cliff fall now that I think about it.

	After I could stand again on my own, I considered what to do from here. I was halfway down a hole, with the bottom filled with hot magma and the top far, far above and far, far too rocky to climb. I could have lost my cool, and I did when it reached about 100 degrees, but now I was used to the heat, and I could already tell I was sweating. I was almost halfway to what I assumed was the core of the Earth. Now I just had to get the hell out. I shielded my eyes with my hand and took a quick peak out over the ledge. The boiling hot magma was in fact rising. Slowly, sure, but that meant it would eventually reach the surface.

	I didn&#39;t have any other options. I&#39;d have to climb. And climb I did. For three whole hours, I climbed, and by the time I reached the top of the hole, I was scared half to death and exhausted at least &#190; to death. If I were a cat, I&#39;d have lost eight and a quarter lives during my climb. I wanted to lay down and just die right there, but I had to get back to my home. I stumbled out of the cave, not bothering to seal up the exit, wandered back to my home through the darkness and mushy dirt, lit a fire with my flint and planks, and fell flat on my face to sleep again.

To make your own plot! That&#39;s the fun of it. I can do whatever the hell I want with it, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s easy to write about. It&#39;s an open book, just like when you start a new Infdev map.

I was stumbling around, lost, confused, looking for shelter, when i tripped and fell into a strange trench-like area.

(even though I fell i managed to get a perfect picture of it beforehand even though I totally had no idea it was there.)

I hit the ground and passed out for a short while, waking up 5 minutes later. I realized there was no way out of here. I realized, however, that there was a cave on the side, with a torch burning in the middle.

I crawled inside out of the cold night air into the smokey air of the cave, noticing that it branced in two directions. One was illuminated by the torches, naturally I followed that.

I walked into a room with a deep pit into which a beautiful underground river flowed. A torch was hammered into the wall nearby. I followed the path beside it for a short while, with no more torches being found. I decided that the only way must be down. I jumped into the column of water, and as if by magic, my fall was instantly slowed as I fell with the water. I safely landed at the bottom and followed the river through it&#39;s twists and turns, struggling to see in the pitch black. The torches ended, and I began to have my doubts.

Suddenly I came to the end of the river and saw something move in the mist.

A single sheep stood before my very eyes. It stared at me, and in a stern yet soothing voice it said &quot;Welcome.&quot; The caverns shook as he spoke.

&quot;You have found my layer, braved the waters, and this act has lead you to me. The cave does not lead deeper, but your journey has not yet ended. Come, you will follow me to the place of your dreams.&quot;

Purple smoke enveloped the air, spreading through the room until as if instantly it wrapped around my being. I woke to a blinding bright light, a lush meadow full of hot strippers riding in tanks having supersoaker fights in white t-shirts lay before my eyes. Instantly, my first thoughts were &quot;I got to post on facepunch about this shit&quot;, and thus here I am. I&#39;m typing this message from a computer composed of 42 supercomputers that got smashed together in a car-on-car-on-fighter jet-on-waverunner collision sitting on top a supermodel&#39;s back in my new mansion the size of Russia.
