&amp;#9773; ------------------ Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Minecraft Stalking Guide. ------------------- &amp;#9773;

For those of you who are fed up with constantly getting killed in SMP and want a little revenge.

[b]Now[/b], the most basic rule of stalking is sneaking. The shift key is not there to be pretty, especially in Minecraft. If you sneak your name tag will be hidden as long as you and your target are separated by a chunk, you can use this to your advantage, but so can your enemy, and that brings us to the second rule of stalking.

[b]Stay vigilant[/b] Any good stalker should know this. Everyone can use the shift key, now most players don&#39;t know that you can jump off ledges in sneak mode, same goes for jumping on ledges, so if you see a players name tag flash for a moment when they leave sneak to jump you know that they have less than lenient intentions. But when a better player is going after you they will usually stay in sneak when jumping, so always be prepared.

[b]Be prepared.[/b] Always have a weapon of some sort with you, even when you are safe in your home.
And always have armor when going after a target. If you are going to try and murder someone with a wooden sword and they have diamond armor then you might as well hug a creeper, sometimes you have to prepare yourself for a certain target and make weapons yourself.
Sometimes being prepared means having less items, if you are planning on going into combat you should store any valuables in a safe place. But prepare that safe place too. trying to hide a chest in a house by placing cobblestone or dirt in front of it is a giveaway towards burglars, use smoothstone in a natural house or whatever material blends into the wall.

[b]Keep your home hidden.[/b] If you plan on building a massive building do so in safe cities, almost every PVP server has one. But if you want to survive on the basics like a real SMP stalker then try to build your home as far away from the spawn as possible, if /sethome is non functional then use landmarks, build a simple landmark, some cobblestone resembling a compass with an extra block facing the spawn will do. Once you make your humble abode cover the entrance with materials that blend with the environment, leave an out of place block somewhere near the entrance. If you are building a house on flat land then you could place water blocks on the walls to slow any enemies, it will slow them to a crawl in sneak mode. Less experienced stalkers would loose patience and eventually stand revealing themselves to you.

[b]Have patience[/b] If you want a good clean kill then you must wait. Always wait until a player has their back turned to you when you go in for a kill, if they are mining you can run up behind them and kill them before they even see your name tag. If they are staring into the darkness looking for any predators find an alternate route or wait until they are not looking, if they spot you leave sneak mode and offer to trade or simply leave, act like you were not intending to end their life.

[b]Pick targets according to the time of day[/b] Most PVP servers also have PVE, preventing players from venturing into the night. Allowing you to kill someone in their own home and also preventing their escape. But come morning most players will go out to mingle with others or simply collect resources. which would allow you to steal from a house or simply scout the area, but if you are looking into revenge as I have previously mentioned, a bucket of lava can go a long way. As I said previously a player will usually go out at day, which will provide you plenty of time to find and slaughter them, unless of course they are not alone.

[b]Don&#39;t go after a group of people[/b] Another key to being a good stalker is to go after targets individually, two people are more likely to win a fight than one. so only go after targets when they are alone, if someone is playing with a friend wait until he/she is alone. going after a group of people will only get you killed and possibly banned depending on the rules of the server.

[b]Follow the fucking rules[/b] Remember when I mentioned cities, they are there for a reason, and most of the time that reason is to provide a safe and friendly place to stay.

[b]Torches hate you, they will always hate you.[/b] Torches might keep the baddies away, but they also sell you out to the entire fucking world. Trying to sneak into a well lit base will usually get you caught, they also give out your base if you are not careful with them.

[b]stick to the shadows, and respect the shadows[/b] The darkness is a blanket for stalkers, a blanket that is choking you because it is tucked in way to tight. If you suddenly find a player returning to the house that you are stealing from then simply hide in the darkest corner you can find, and kill the player when he is in reach.

[b]Last but not least, get the fuck out of the crime scene.[/b] Just murdered your nemesis and burned down his home? Get as far away as possible, then lay low for a while. Try to return to base to unload all your goodies afterwards unless a player is near.

I hope this guide will help people who have fallen victim of stalkers, and help them get revenge once they have regained their bearings. Or, you know, just help people murder and rob someone they don&#39;t like."

&amp;#9773; ------------------ Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Minecraft Stalking Guide. ------------------- &amp;#9773;

For those of you who are fed up with constantly getting killed in SMP and want a little revenge.

[b]Now[/b], the most basic rule of stalking is sneaking. The shift key is not there to be pretty, especially in Minecraft. If you sneak your name tag will be hidden as long as you and your target are separated by a chunk, you can use this to your advantage, but so can your enemy, and that brings us to the second rule of stalking.

[b]Stay vigilant[/b] Any good stalker should know this. Everyone can use the shift key, now most players don&#39;t know that you can jump off ledges in sneak mode, same goes for jumping on ledges, so if you see a players name tag flash for a moment when they leave sneak to jump you know that they have less than lenient intentions. But when a better player is going after you they will usually stay in sneak when jumping, so always be prepared.

[b]Be prepared.[/b] Always have a weapon of some sort with you, even when you are safe in your home.
And always have armor when going after a target. If you are going to try and murder someone with a wooden sword and they have diamond armor then you might as well hug a creeper, sometimes you have to prepare yourself for a certain target and make weapons yourself.
Sometimes being prepared means having less items, if you are planning on going into combat you should store any valuables in a safe place. But prepare that safe place too. trying to hide a chest in a house by placing cobblestone or dirt in front of it is a giveaway towards burglars, use smoothstone in a natural house or whatever material blends into the wall.

[b]Keep your home hidden.[/b] If you plan on building a massive building do so in safe cities, almost every PVP server has one. But if you want to survive on the basics like a real SMP stalker then try to build your home as far away from the spawn as possible, if /sethome is non functional then use landmarks, build a simple landmark, some cobblestone resembling a compass with an extra block facing the spawn will do. Once you make your humble abode cover the entrance with materials that blend with the environment, leave an out of place block somewhere near the entrance. If you are building a house on flat land then you could place water blocks on the walls to slow any enemies, it will slow them to a crawl in sneak mode. Less experienced stalkers would loose patience and eventually stand revealing themselves to you.

[b]Have patience[/b] If you want a good clean kill then you must wait. Always wait until a player has their back turned to you when you go in for a kill, if they are mining you can run up behind them and kill them before they even see your name tag. If they are staring into the darkness looking for any predators find an alternate route or wait until they are not looking, if they spot you leave sneak mode and offer to trade or simply leave, act like you were not intending to end their life.

[b]Pick targets according to the time of day[/b] Most PVP servers also have PVE, preventing players from venturing into the night. Allowing you to kill someone in their own home and also preventing their escape. But come morning most players will go out to mingle with others or simply collect resources. which would allow you to steal from a house or simply scout the area, but if you are looking into revenge as I have previously mentioned, a bucket of lava can go a long way. As I said previously a player will usually go out at day, which will provide you plenty of time to find and slaughter them, unless of course they are not alone.

[b]Don&#39;t go after a group of people[/b] Another key to being a good stalker is to go after targets individually, two people are more likely to win a fight than one. so only go after targets when they are alone, if someone is playing with a friend wait until he/she is alone. going after a group of people will only get you killed and possibly banned depending on the rules of the server.

[b]Follow the fucking rules[/b] Remember when I mentioned cities, they are there for a reason, and most of the time that reason is to provide a safe and friendly place to stay.

[b]Torches hate you, they will always hate you.[/b] Torches might keep the baddies away, but they also sell you out to the entire fucking world. Trying to sneak into a well lit base will usually get you caught, they also give out your base if you are not careful with them.

[b]stick to the shadows, and respect the shadows[/b] The darkness is a blanket for stalkers, a blanket that is choking you because it is tucked in way to tight. If you suddenly find a player returning to the house that you are stealing from then simply hide in the darkest corner you can find, and kill the player when he is in reach.

[b]Last but not least, get the fuck out of the crime scene.[/b] Just murdered your nemesis and burned down his home? Get as far away as possible, then lay low for a while. Try to return to base to unload all your goodies afterwards unless a player is near.

I hope this guide will help people who have fallen victim of stalkers, and help them get revenge once they have regained their bearings. Or, you know, just help people murder and rob someone they don&#39;t like.</span>
