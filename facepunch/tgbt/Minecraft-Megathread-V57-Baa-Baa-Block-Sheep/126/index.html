                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=The Jman Wik;28081252]the core mechanic of the game would be nice... if i was afflicted with socially crippling autism. still the core block mechanic is the game&#39;s most compelling feature. too bad it was ripped directly from infiniminer

 the rest of the game is gathering blocks to make tools. how fun. the crafting recipes are impossible to figure out without the aid of a guide/wiki. so much for a sense of discovery. 

there are monsters that inhabit the game world, but the spawn code is so lazy and and nonfunctional that they&#39;re more of a nuisance than anything. the combat system is simple point and click, and it breaks and becomes cheap in confined areas. furthermore, should you die, you&#39;re reset to the spawn. have fun losing your items when a green dildo spawns next to you and fucks your shit. notch: &quot;guys my game has infinite terrain generation&quot; *harshly punishes exploration*

the multiplayer hardly even works despite the game being in &quot;beta&quot;, and the singleplayer quickly becomes tedious and boring. the only reason i enjoyed infiniminer was the multiplayer

2/10[/QUOTE]
 
Again with the autism. Why is it that everyone thinks the majority of the fanbase is autistic? Minecraftforum, I bet... No. We are not. Now go tell the entire CAD community that they&#39;re also autistic. Have fun.

It was ripped from infiniminer. A tech demo. That was based on an older game. Minecraft is a conglomeration of Infiniminer, Dwarf Fortress, and [insert generic RPG here]. 

Monsters haven&#39;t posed any issue to me. Just kill them. Or play on peaceful. The setting is there for a reason.

Multiplayer works fine, if you find a good server. For instance, I play on a server based in California, with very little lag, and even less bugginess. 

Now... Again, I said you can get a refund. If you wish, then do so. But please, for the love of sanity, don&#39;t come into a megathread and complain about the topic of said megathread. You know what you got yourself into."

Again with the autism. Why is it that everyone thinks the majority of the fanbase is autistic? Minecraftforum, I bet... No. We are not. Now go tell the entire CAD community that they&#39;re also autistic. Have fun.

It was ripped from infiniminer. A tech demo. That was based on an older game. Minecraft is a conglomeration of Infiniminer, Dwarf Fortress, and [insert generic RPG here]. 

Monsters haven&#39;t posed any issue to me. Just kill them. Or play on peaceful. The setting is there for a reason.

Multiplayer works fine, if you find a good server. For instance, I play on a server based in California, with very little lag, and even less bugginess. 

Now... Again, I said you can get a refund. If you wish, then do so. But please, for the love of sanity, don&#39;t come into a megathread and complain about the topic of said megathread. You know what you got yourself into.</span>

If you&#39;re going to claim that MC is a ripoff of infiniminer that&#39;s just silly. Notch has said himself that the entire basis of minecraft&#39;s block system was pretty much directly based on infiniminer&#39;s system. This is old news. As for recipies, if you really have trouble figuring out how to do anything when the only things you can do are break trees and collect dirt/sand/gravel upon spawning, you&#39;ve got a problem there. It&#39;s a fairly obvious transition to at least make the crafting table, and from there it&#39;s just a process of placing shit on your crafting table to see what happens. If you just went straight to the wiki without even trying to puzzle out the recipies for yourself, you&#39;ve already lost a bit of the experience. 
The monsters in minecraft are pretty retarded, you have my agreement there. However, your comment on the combat system is fairly retarded. &quot;hurr durr point and click&quot; goes for most all PC games involving mice, which most do, with the exception of QWOP. It&#39;s not just a &quot;click on the enemy lol he ded&quot; system, there is some small amount of skill necessary to fight of hordes (very, very small hordes. think like hordes of 3) monsters at a time, through the night and dark caves. If you honestly are unable to function in confined areas with the combat system, you&#39;re doing something wrong because I&#39;ve never had a problem with it. Do you want every mechanic of the game to be perfect right at the get-go? Remember, many of these features were coded by one man in a relatively short amount of time, and there will be complications.
Multiplayer really has no problems with it aside from the fact that notch is too stupid to keep backup servers somewhere for the authentication side of it. Sure there are a few bugs, such as those blinking animals and occasional lag spikes, but unless you live in rural Siberia, there shouldn&#39;t be too much lag for you if it&#39;s a decent host.

learn to tolerate dissent against things you like crybaby. the minecraft megathread is for minecraft discussion. it&#39;s not your private circle jerk. i&#39;m allowed to post negative feedback if i feel like it.

infiniminer was not a tech demo. it was a full game. second, this game has few rpg elements. All of the crafting recipes are available from the start, and most of them just allow you to dig different block types faster.

 a sandbox game with no conflict is boring, so peaceful mode is out. the ability to remove monsters entirely doesn&#39;t justify them not working correctly to start with.

the multiplayer is undeniably buggy. it&#39;s not even updated concurrently with the singleplayer. they&#39;re like 2 seperate games.  

lastly, notch is terrible at responding to support requests. just look at his support forum. at one point, paypal locked down his account because he wasn&#39;t providing support for his product. i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll get my refund...1.5 months after i ask for one."

infiniminer was not a tech demo. it was a full game. second, this game has few rpg elements. All of the crafting recipes are available from the start, and most of them just allow you to dig different block types faster.

 a sandbox game with no conflict is boring, so peaceful mode is out. the ability to remove monsters entirely doesn&#39;t justify them not working correctly to start with.

Just to clarify on the rules, 

Racism and Homophobia is bannable on first offense on all VG servers NO EXCEPTIONS
Griefing/Theft on VG is bannable
Griefing/Theft on SVG is allowed, as is PVPing
Bitching is a bannable offense
Trolling is usually okay, trolling after being asked to stop by an admin is bannable 
Magoo/Zero-Point&#39;s word is law on New Ventlegille, obey him
Harassing admins is a bannable offense

Note: A ban on one VG server does not carry over to other servers unless it is a very serious offense (breaking multiple rules, threats, etc)
Bans may be appealed and or lifted with good behavior on other VG servers with approval from another admin
