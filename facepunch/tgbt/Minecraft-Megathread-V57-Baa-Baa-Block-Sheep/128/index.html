Redstone is very easy. It&#39;s merely logic gates.

Basically, when a note block is supplied with power from wire or a redstone torch, it plays a note based on the blocktype under it.

If you rightclick a noteblock, you will increase the pitch of the block, Each blocktype has 25 different pitches.

Look on the redstone circuits page on Minepedia, look for the Pulsers and the Delays and use them (especially the delays) to time out the tune. Note blocks are also on Minepedia, along with all the information regarding them. Theres some tutorials on this exact thing as well."

Was trying this plugin earlier, but it didn&#39;t work. It was redstone sponge interaction, so you could hook up a restone wire and control the flowing of water(floodgate). That would be freaking awesome if it worked, sadly it did not. That is what I desperately want, some form of working floodgate. I do think there is a mod but it&#39;s only for single player?

Glowstone that can be toggled with redstone. ( makeshift lightbulb anyone? )[/QUOTE]
 
Was trying this plugin earlier, but it didn&#39;t work. It was redstone sponge interaction, so you could hook up a restone wire and control the flowing of water(floodgate). That would be freaking awesome if it worked, sadly it did not. That is what I desperately want, some form of working floodgate. I do think there is a mod but it&#39;s only for single player?

Floodgates in minecraft should work like this:

Power = Gate is at metaphorical 0, 0, 0
No power = gate is at metaphorical 0, 0, -1

[Editline]a[/Editline]

If block is at 0, 0, 0 and gate is at 0, 0, -1 and the gate has power, nothing will happen."

Basically, when a note block is supplied with power from wire or a redstone torch, it plays a note based on the blocktype under it.

If you rightclick a noteblock, you will increase the pitch of the block, Each blocktype has 25 different pitches.

I said:

[quote]This song doesn&#39;t really describe what goes on in Minecraft very well. In this song the character spends the whole time hiding from the monsters in the spawnhouse that doesn&#39;t actually exist in the game anymore. Then there&#39;s TALKIN BOUT MINECRAFT again and again.

To which he responded:

[quote]@L4D2Tour You apparently played minecraft AFTER it went beta...[/quote]
[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKG3Tb8lMhg[/url]

That&#39;s actually sort of insulting considering that I&#39;ve been with the game since the beginning. :smith:

So, here&#39;s what I said to him:

[quote]@WW2BOY Actually, I&#39;m one of the first handful buyers by the name of Doomish. I&#39;ve been playing the game since before it had multiplayer at all. I realize the song was written during Indev, but even so, it doesn&#39;t really tell what the game is about.

                            <span v-pre>Hey guys, look! The guy who wrote the Minecraft song responded to my comment!

I said:

[quote]This song doesn&#39;t really describe what goes on in Minecraft very well. In this song the character spends the whole time hiding from the monsters in the spawnhouse that doesn&#39;t actually exist in the game anymore. Then there&#39;s TALKIN BOUT MINECRAFT again and again.

To which he responded:

[quote]@L4D2Tour You apparently played minecraft AFTER it went beta...[/quote]
[url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKG3Tb8lMhg[/url]

That&#39;s actually sort of insulting considering that I&#39;ve been with the game since the beginning. :smith:

So, here&#39;s what I said to him:

[quote]@WW2BOY Actually, I&#39;m one of the first handful buyers by the name of Doomish. I&#39;ve been playing the game since before it had multiplayer at all. I realize the song was written during Indev, but even so, it doesn&#39;t really tell what the game is about.

I&#39;m surprised he actually said something to me. Weird.</span>
