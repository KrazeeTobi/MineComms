Open the minecraft.jar file in 7-zip and place the files (base.vsh, base.fsh, final.fsh) into the, &quot;shaders,&quot; folder. Then just close 7-zip, run minecraft.exe (if using windows), and enjoy. Also, there aren&#39;t always all three files needed, apparently. I&#39;m new to the shaders game, but the only files that I&#39;ve dealt with are the base.vsh and final.fsh...

                        <postrender input="Here&#39;s a new thought: if one sets Grass or Plants on fire, the result is an Ash-like topsoil similar to Snow, making the block look as if it had actually been set ablaze. Removing the Ash with a Shovel gives a pile of Ashes, which would need to have a different appearance to a pile of Gunpowder, as a pile of Ashes would look similar to a pile of Gunpowder in real life. Unless, that is, the Gunpowder piles looked black as they do in reality, and the Ash piles looked like what Gunpowder piles look like now.

Ash could also form on the ground during an Ashfall, a weather-based event that would happen on occassion in the rare Volcanic biomes (as well as surrounding non-Volcanic chunks), due to the eruptions on an unseen volcano. And with that, I once again suggest Dynamic Weather Patterns. The way it would work would be like this; there&#39;d be a random chance for the clouds to change in certain ways, and with it certain environmental effects would occur. For more info on how Biomes work (and how Weather may work), look at this chart detailing Rainfall and Temperature from the Minecraft Wiki.
[IMG]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/7/73/BiomesGraph.png[/IMG]

Here&#39;s a list of possible weather types:
-Normal: Clouds stay normal, nothing out-of-the-ordinary happens.

-Rain: Clouds turn grey, rain falls from the sky, plant growth increases during this weather period, burning objects are extinguished, any open-air water blocks gain a special rippled graphical effect that looks like a Portal, emulating the effect of rain on open water, as well as open-air Lava emitting steam like nobody&#39;s business and flowing slower. Chance to occur depends on the Rainfall value of the biome (high Rainfall = high chance of Rain).

-Snow: Clouds turn dark-grey, snowflakes drift down from the sky, Snow settles on most blocks (except non-solid blocks and the blocks under them). Chance to occur depends on the Temperature value of the biome (low temperature = high chance of Snow).

-Ash: Clouds turn red, grey flakes of ash fall from the sky, Volcanic Ash (a natural variant of regular Ashes made from burning Plants) settles on most blocks except the ones Snow doesn&#39;t fall on, plants grow quicker than in rain (ash is kind of a fertiliser IRL). Only occurs on rare occasions in the rare Volcanic biome, but the surrounding area of the &quot;eruption&quot; (4 to 40 blocks from the epicenter) will end up covered in Volcanic Ash. 2 piles of Volcanic Ashes crafted together would yield a Pumice Stone, useful for sharpening one&#39;s Tools (it repairs a Tool by a small amount when used on it, helping you get a bit more mileage out of your precious Diamond tools).

If it happens at night, the moon will turn red, and the undead will become even more hungry for your blood, their eyes glowing red like Spider eyes and their numbers swelling greatly. Best to stay inside and lock your cellar doors. Speaking of which...

3 Plank blocks + 1 Cobblestone block = the Trapdoor, a door that goes in the ceiling or floor, allowing you to finally build the attics and basements of your dreams ([U][B]OR YOUR WORST NIGHTMARES[/B][/U]). Thanks to the in-built Ladder that drops down when the Trapdoor is open, you may clamber up through it into the attic, or descent carefully into the basement, depending on whether you put it on the ceiling or floor, as well as whether or not you&#39;ve actually made an attic/basement beforehand.

One final thing to suggest is a little something I call the Cauldron. Forged from 3 Obsidian blocks (placed in a similar formation to a Bucket or Bowl) and 3 Redstone Torches (placed underneath), this giant cooking pot is used for brewing magical potions, seeing as Obsidian has magical properties. After all, what other material opens a gateway to another world when set on fire in the shape of an archway?

Anyways, the way you make potions with the Cauldron can be broken down into X (relatively) easy steps.

Step 1: Right-click on the Cauldron to open the Cauldron menu. 
Step 2: Use a Bucket of Water on the Water square. The Cauldron now has 4 units of Water to brew potions with. The Water square can be topped up with additional Water, allowing a maximum of 16 units of Water for the Cauldron to use.
Step 3: Place two different ingredients, be they Food items, Plants or Dyes, into the two different Ingredients squares. For example, put a Cooked Porkchop in one square and a unit of Rose Red in the other.
Step 4: Press the &quot;Brew&quot; button in the menu, the ingredients will have vanished, a unit of Water is subtracted, and the Potion square (right of the Ingredients squares) will be filled with a single use of the brewed Potion. 
Step 5: Use a Wooden Bowl on the Potion square to transform the empty bowl into a Bowl filled with the brewed Potion, after which the Cauldron will empty and ready to use again.

If you followed these steps exactly, and used the Cooked Porkchop &amp; Rose Red, the Potion square would have 1 use of Roseblood in it, a Potion that adds 3 extra Hearts to your Life Bar. These additional hearts are green, and are &quot;temporary&quot; in the sense that you cannot heal them, and once they&#39;re gone, they can only be restored by drinking another bowl of Roseblood. Basically it&#39;s an Overheal potion.

If you have enough ingredients, you can quickly make several instances of the same potion. This can come in handy if you are in a group in SMP, as you or one of your padres can deploy their Cauldron, toss in some Water and ingredients, and before you know it, he&#39;s got a Cauldron full of Roseblood, and the other member of the group are lining up with their Bowls to grab a serving, like hobos lining up at the soup kitchen. Speaking of soup kitchens, in theory one could use the Cauldron to quickly knock up about a dozen servings of Mushroom Soup (or Stew, whatever) at a much faster rate than with a Workbench, thus allowing Cauldron Chefs to truly heal their party with plenty of Soup to spare.

A very important thing to remember is that you&#39;ll need to clear the Potion square of Potion before you can brew a different potion, so don&#39;t make more than you need. Also, the Cauldron is so sturdy that it takes a LONG time to dismantle, just like the Obsidian it was forged from. And for good reason, too, since if you dismantle the Cauldron, you only get the Cauldron, and anything inside it, like the Water, the ingredients, the Potion, all those are lost if they&#39;re still in there, so remember to clear it out before moving on. Unless you have plenty of Obsidian to spare, of course, in which case you can just leave it there and come back later if you&#39;re in the area and need to Brew some potions.

Well, that&#39;s all for tonight. So to recap, I covered Ash, Weather, Red Moon Nights (briefly), Trapdoors, and most important of all, Cauldrons and Potions. Try to read it all, even if reading is a challenge for you, and you&#39;ll actually understand what i&#39;m saying.

                            <span v-pre>Here&#39;s a new thought: if one sets Grass or Plants on fire, the result is an Ash-like topsoil similar to Snow, making the block look as if it had actually been set ablaze. Removing the Ash with a Shovel gives a pile of Ashes, which would need to have a different appearance to a pile of Gunpowder, as a pile of Ashes would look similar to a pile of Gunpowder in real life. Unless, that is, the Gunpowder piles looked black as they do in reality, and the Ash piles looked like what Gunpowder piles look like now.

Ash could also form on the ground during an Ashfall, a weather-based event that would happen on occassion in the rare Volcanic biomes (as well as surrounding non-Volcanic chunks), due to the eruptions on an unseen volcano. And with that, I once again suggest Dynamic Weather Patterns. The way it would work would be like this; there&#39;d be a random chance for the clouds to change in certain ways, and with it certain environmental effects would occur. For more info on how Biomes work (and how Weather may work), look at this chart detailing Rainfall and Temperature from the Minecraft Wiki.

Here&#39;s a list of possible weather types:
-Normal: Clouds stay normal, nothing out-of-the-ordinary happens.

-Rain: Clouds turn grey, rain falls from the sky, plant growth increases during this weather period, burning objects are extinguished, any open-air water blocks gain a special rippled graphical effect that looks like a Portal, emulating the effect of rain on open water, as well as open-air Lava emitting steam like nobody&#39;s business and flowing slower.

-Snow: Clouds turn dark-grey, snowflakes drift down from the sky, Snow settles on most blocks (except non-solid blocks and the blocks under them). Chance to occur depends on the Temperature value of the biome (low temperature = high chance of Snow).

Anything over 32x32 (And even then, some call that HD) are usually considered &quot;HD&quot;, so yes, HD packs are terrible because they loop so much.

Even 32x32 packs look terrible. Only 16x16 looks good. :colbert:"

HD doesn&#39;t necessarily mean good. It&#39;s just high res. Default textures are 16x16, so even a simple 64px pack is 16 times larger. FHD is 5 times larger than DVD. What&#39;s your point?
