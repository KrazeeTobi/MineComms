(Ignore the numbers)

It would be a fallout-ish style of gameplay focusing more on raiding and looting than actually cutting down trees or mining. There are scattered chests, iron on buildings, and also mines in scattered places around the map. Most people will want to stick to the city, as it would give them a nice area for PvPing for resources. Eventually, people would create alliances and group up, and certain natural factions would form. People would create their own towns and bases, and wars would naturally start. On the flipside, there could be some who just randomly kill people, but are naturally put in place by others. If something seemed too unbalanced, like an organization that pretty much took over the entire city, I would put them down to size for the fun of the rest of the players, possibly by mounting a creeper attack on their main base.

The main draw of this map besides the city, however, are the sneaky little easter eggs and events. Some of these include a failsafe switch hidden somewhere to &quot;destroy the server in case of catastrophe&quot;, an obsidian room holding a diamond block (it takes diamond to open this up, as well as about thirty minutes of staring at that block digging, so you have to be sure you&#39;re doing this in secret), mob spawners, basements full of traps, plenty of TNT traps, secret little buildings and cottages out in the wild, and much more.

Events would be triggered by me, the admin, and would include things such as spawning loads of creepers or other mobs, opening up a vault of diamond for people to squabble over, releasing a bit of lava around the city, blowing up a building, me walking around in full diamond armor and diamond sword holding lots of goodies for whoever kills me, making a mysterious island appear over the city, and other things. 

The map would be constantly changing, so sometimes I would add little cottages around the outskirts of the towns, refill chests, remove torches, add monster spawners, burn forests, creating pockets of diamond ore in caves, and other little things to add to the replayability.

There would be a schedule, so for example, I would create an event on every Saturday and Wednesday, and maybe opening a vault every Monday for people to search for the rest of the week, revealing the coordinates, one axis every hour, on Friday. Maybe a Mob Monday, in which a random mob would be spawned quite a bit? This could be friendly or enemy mobs, so you may have a couple ghasts in the sky, loads of pigs in a building, or skeleton invasion from the sewers.

The rules would be a tad more complicated than most PvP servers, but all for good reason.

Some server statistics: Fire would not spread (too many wood buildings), PvE enabled, PvP enabled, creepers would be nerfed (would be ajusted and tweaked)

1. No destroying something unless you have a real purpose, like getting into an enemy base, gathering resources, getting up the side of something, setting traps, or destroying an enemy encampment. AKA no random griefing of unused buildings.

2. Killing someone within the boundaries of the spawn is simply not allowed, as well as killing someone repeatedly as long as they are not properly prepared. Feel free to attempt to kill that guy with iron armor, but generally don&#39;t be mean to newcomers and kill them when they don&#39;t have anything of value. Anyone that attacks you is fair game, however.

3. No hacking or using duping glitches, blah blah blah

4. Be respectful and ethical, but you can trash talk a little if you really want to. Just keep it to a minimum. Drama should be taken care of by a duel, not rants and COOL CAPS messages over the public chat.

5. No abusing your mod powers. This means giving yourself an advantage over other players will result in a ban or demotion.

6. Feel free to use TNT, but no more than three at a time. Any more than three TNTs exploding at once will get you a warning. Also, only use it to accomplish a purpose. Don&#39;t blow up a building if no one is in it, or just for fun. Make traps, use it for combat purposes, mine with it, or anything like that.

So, what do you think? Would you like playing on this sort of server?"
