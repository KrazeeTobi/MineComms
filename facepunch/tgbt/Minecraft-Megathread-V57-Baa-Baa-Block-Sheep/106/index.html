You can also change that switch to 2X4

i was walking on my sp world 3 trying to find the first coal i needed. at this point i had a small cave that was blocked up with dirt and stone tools, it had been 1 night and i survived in a 1x2 hole in the ground. after i had found some coal, i had gotten myself lost quite far away from my cave so i used cartograph to map the world to see where i was. i looked around for myself on the map and found the torch i had created to make finding myself a little more easy. i drew a red line in paint and opened up minecraft again, loaded up the world and began to follow the imaginary line toward my spawn. i eventually reached a point that i had to look at the map again. i scrolled around and found the line i had made, and a strange tower. it looked like cobble and was about 2 stories high, but was really dark, apart from some low light. i diverted the line drawing on the map and pointed it to the tower and went to it in minecraft, it was cobble and was 2 stories height. there were no stairs or ladders or anything, so i broke a hole through the cobble and stepped in. there was a small staircase in the center with redstone going all the way to the top of the tower i climbed up and stepped into the top room where there was a large circuit filling the entire room. i carefully stepped through the circuit to reach the other side of the room. the circuit was a few rapid pulsers with memory cells connected and a noteblock where i was stood. the noteblock was tuned really high, it  seemed like it was higher than the max not you could get. nearby was a switch, when i hit it, all the redstone torches around the room began flashing and turning on or off. the block began to play in a seemingly random sequence. i hit the switch again and the circuit stopped for as second and then the switched flicked back on again. i broke the switch and it returned again like the protected blocks in SMP, but i was surely in singleplayer. the building was perplexing, and still 100% dark so i  threw up some torches and punched the redstone circuitry, it returned as said before. the sound was getting annoying, it seemed to repeat. after looking around the tower for a while the tune was stuck in my head. i alt tabbed out of the game and started up itunes to listen to some music. i muted minecraft and continued, but i couldn&#39;t get the tune from my head. i build a small building nearby the tower and stayed in it for the next few nights, strip mining at bedrock, all the time the clicking sound was still audible. even through over 50 layers of solid stone it sounded like it was next to me. after finding diamonds and a large vein of iron, i noticed that the clicking sound of glass had stopped. i walked into the tower through the same hole i made before with my iron armor, a diamond sword and a ton of cooked ham. all my torched were broken and on the floor, so i threw them back up again. i flicked the switch and... nothing, no changes to the circuit or note block had been made. i thought about the tune for a few real hours and realized that it could be morse code. i went to wikipedia and looked up morse code, and spent the next few hours remembering and writing down the tune on a piece of paper before writing it into notepad and putting it through a morse code translator ( this one [URL]http://morsecode.scphillips.com/jtranslator.html[/URL] ) i got this:

WHEN THE SIGNAL STOPS THE TIME IS RIGHT

I thought about it and loaded up minecraft again. once more the tower had been rolled back and my torches were gone, and the morse code was absent. any changes i make will get rolled back whenever the chunk is re-loaded. to this day i have no idea about the mystery of the tower, and still live next to it.
