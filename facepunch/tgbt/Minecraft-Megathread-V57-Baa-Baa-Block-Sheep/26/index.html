I was going to post this in the Gift Giving Thread, but I&#39;m not looking for a gift and that thread seems to have dissappeared. :/

I was wondering if anyone still has an unused Minecraft Gift Code from Alpha they havn&#39;t used that I could buy off of them. I&#39;m looking for something pre-beta, because I don&#39;t want to get dragged into the shitstorm this the following quote has the possibility to start.

Minecraft Beta: December 20, 2010
The next epoch is upon us! The skies are trembling, pigs are growing wings, and the nether is turning awfully cold, as Minecraft slowly crawls out of Alpha..

Minecraft will reach Beta status on December 20th, 2010.

~~~~We will also change the license to remove the line that promises all future versions of the game for free.

Buying the game during beta will include all updates up until release, of course, and bug patches will be free.~~~[/QUOTE]

You could sell it for exactly how much it&#39;s being sold for now, seeing as it has the added benefit of getting free DLCs after launch.

Also I wouldn&#39;t ask on the MC forums.  I think you&#39;re not allowed to sell accounts."

My minecraft was payed for in the alpha stage so you will still be able to get updates after launch. 

I don&#39;t want much. lay down an offer and we will see what happens.[/QUOTE]
 
You could sell it for exactly how much it&#39;s being sold for now, seeing as it has the added benefit of getting free DLCs after launch.

Also I wouldn&#39;t ask on the MC forums.  I think you&#39;re not allowed to sell accounts.</span>

Don&#39;t know if you saw my PM, but posting here with an offer.

I&#39;ll give you that $15 US for the account. I assume you&#39;ve got a Paypal to work with? (Derp)

Also, I didn&#39;t just show up here from google. Seems I&#39;ve been banned. :(

But I am not looking for a square offer I am just looking to not have all my money go to waist.[/QUOTE]
 
Don&#39;t know if you saw my PM, but posting here with an offer.

I&#39;ll give you that $15 US for the account. I assume you&#39;ve got a Paypal to work with? (Derp)

Also, I didn&#39;t just show up here from google. Seems I&#39;ve been banned. :(
