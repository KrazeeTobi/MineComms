I was using Gerodoku&#39;s texture pack (the one that Lewis uses in the Yogscast) and the shovel was held upside down, which I loved. 

But then I was messing around with some mods and had to start from scratch, and I reinstalled the texture pack same as before, but now the shovel is held rightside up.

Is there any way to change it back to upside down?"

                            <span v-pre>Goddamn it this is bothering me so much

I was using Gerodoku&#39;s texture pack (the one that Lewis uses in the Yogscast) and the shovel was held upside down, which I loved. 

But then I was messing around with some mods and had to start from scratch, and I reinstalled the texture pack same as before, but now the shovel is held rightside up.

Is there any way to change it back to upside down?</span>

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Chezhead;27943471]You know what? I&#39;m going to work on creating a bropocolypse type thing, but with a fluid city instead of randomly placed creations. I&#39;ll work on making it quite realistic and attempt to get someone to host it.

If anyone has some realistic buildings they would like to give me in .schematic files, I would be glad to feature them in this sort of thing. It would be as big as possible, as well as having plenty of secrets and other little huts outside of town.

When the SMP server would be out, it would have PvP, PvE, and that would really be it. I would attempt to make a journal logging my adventures, with meeting people and such, making it sort of a post-apocalyptic fiction blog, where me and my companions journey the city and everything outside of it.

I would have a grainy, apocalyptic texture pack, as well as a bit of photoshopping during some parts, like if something got on me or other things.[/QUOTE]
 
If the guy who&#39;s doing the other bropocolypse map lets you use some stuff from that, it would be a good start.</span>
