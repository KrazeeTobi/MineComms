so you&#39;re laughing about the fact that he got a minecraft-related title, but you don&#39;t even care about the fact that he spent money to get some words under his name on an internet forum?

The thing is, though, the game&#39;s not likely to be optimized for some time. It was a side project done by a guy who just sort of ran with it, not a game started with a particular objective in mind. Sure, he&#39;s got the company now, but that means jack shit. It&#39;s still an indie game, and it&#39;s still in early (hopefully) development. There will be problems, and optimization is hardly on the top of his list, however much it should be."

so you&#39;re laughing about the fact that he got a minecraft-related title, but you don&#39;t even care about the fact that he spent money to get some words under his name on an internet forum?

[QUOTE=MedicWine;28081020]Seems like a valid argument to me. I understand it&#39;s in beta and all, but his review is going to be over the game in it&#39;s current state.

[/QUOTE]
 
The thing is, though, the game&#39;s not likely to be optimized for some time. It was a side project done by a guy who just sort of ran with it, not a game started with a particular objective in mind. Sure, he&#39;s got the company now, but that means jack shit. It&#39;s still an indie game, and it&#39;s still in early (hopefully) development. There will be problems, and optimization is hardly on the top of his list, however much it should be.</span>

Okay... Question. What is your issue? Do you have a mental condition? What were you expecting when you came into this thread, a thread about [b]MINECRAFT[/b] of all things, to complain about Minecraft... Did you expect a [i]positive[/i] response? Good lord... 

Of course not. Why? You&#39;re a troll. How can I tell? 

You came into a megathread about a game complaining about a game, expecting... what, exactly? 

But, since it is my sworn duty to help people... Notch gives refunds if you&#39;ve purchased the game within the last 30 days, and dislike it for some reason. Just E-mail him or one of his employees, and he&#39;ll refund your paypal in full. You&#39;re welcome. Now get out."

See above.

And now that I&#39;ve secured a place, time for my reasoning.

See, I could personally care less if he didn&#39;t like the game. It&#39;s not that big a deal. A few of my friends can&#39;t stand it, but they&#39;re not the most creative bunch... Anyway, my issue was with what he chose to do. He chose to come into a thread and incite a reaction. Which is exactly what happened. That&#39;s trolling, comrades."

What were you expecting when you came into this thread, a thread about [b]MINECRAFT[/b] of all things, to complain about Minecraft... Did you expect a [i]positive[/i] response? Good lord... 

Of course not. Why? You&#39;re a troll. How can I tell? 

You came into a megathread about a game complaining about a game, expecting... what, exactly? 

But, since it is my sworn duty to help people... Notch gives refunds if you&#39;ve purchased the game within the last 30 days, and dislike it for some reason. Just E-mail him or one of his employees, and he&#39;ll refund your paypal in full. You&#39;re welcome. Now get out.[/QUOTE]

I had this software for a capture card that for some odd reason, didnt work on some computers. I searched and searched, and the only thing I could find out was that it just didnt work on some computers. There was no fix, it just didnt work for you. Sometimes minecraft can be this way. I&#39;ve played minecraft on like 15 or so different computers, and each one seems to have different errors or problems.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Derpmeifter;28081190]Honestly if you expect to participate in an indie game that&#39;s only recently gained really competent staff (love you jeb) and which is still in the Beta stage, and find it perfectly optimized for your system, you&#39;re just being silly.[/QUOTE]
 
I had this software for a capture card that for some odd reason, didnt work on some computers. I searched and searched, and the only thing I could find out was that it just didnt work on some computers. There was no fix, it just didnt work for you. Sometimes minecraft can be this way. I&#39;ve played minecraft on like 15 or so different computers, and each one seems to have different errors or problems.

[QUOTE=The Jman Wik;28081252]the core mechanic of the game would be nice... if i was afflicted with socially crippling autism. still the core block mechanic is the game&#39;s most compelling feature. too bad it was ripped directly from infiniminer

Wow.  I completely agree with all of that. This just isnt the game for you.</span>
