&amp;#9773; ------------------ Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Minecraft Stalking Guide. ------------------- &amp;#9773;

For those of you who are fed up with constantly getting killed in SMP and want a little revenge.

[b]Now[/b], the most basic rule of stalking is sneaking. The shift key is not there to be pretty, especially in Minecraft. If you sneak your name tag will be hidden as long as you and your target are separated by a chunk, you can use this to your advantage, but so can your enemy, and that brings us to the second rule of stalking.

[b]Stay vigilant[/b] Any good stalker should know this. Everyone can use the shift key, now most players don&#39;t know that you can jump off ledges in sneak mode, same goes for jumping on ledges, so if you see a players name tag flash for a moment when they leave sneak to jump you know that they have less than lenient intentions. But when a better player is going after you they will usually stay in sneak when jumping, so always be prepared.

[b]Be prepared.[/b] Always have a weapon of some sort with you, even when you are safe in your home.
And always have armor when going after a target. If you are going to try and murder someone with a wooden sword and they have diamond armor then you might as well hug a creeper, sometimes you have to prepare yourself for a certain target and make weapons yourself.
Sometimes being prepared means having less items, if you are planning on going into combat you should store any valuables in a safe place. But prepare that safe place too. trying to hide a chest in a house by placing cobblestone or dirt in front of it is a giveaway towards burglars, use smoothstone in a natural house or whatever material blends into the wall.

[b]Keep your home hidden.[/b] If you plan on building a massive building do so in safe cities, almost every PVP server has one. But if you want to survive on the basics like a real SMP stalker then try to build your home as far away from the spawn as possible, if /sethome is non functional then use landmarks, build a simple landmark, some cobblestone resembling a compass with an extra block facing the spawn will do. Once you make your humble abode cover the entrance with materials that blend with the environment, leave an out of place block somewhere near the entrance. If you are building a house on flat land then you could place water blocks on the walls to slow any enemies, it will slow them to a crawl in sneak mode. Less experienced stalkers would loose patience and eventually stand revealing themselves to you.

[b]Have patience[/b] If you want a good clean kill then you must wait. Always wait until a player has their back turned to you when you go in for a kill, if they are mining you can run up behind them and kill them before they even see your name tag. If they are staring into the darkness looking for any predators find an alternate route or wait until they are not looking, if they spot you leave sneak mode and offer to trade or simply leave, act like you were not intending to end their life.

[b]Pick targets according to the time of day[/b] Most PVP servers also have PVE, preventing players from venturing into the night. Allowing you to kill someone in their own home and also preventing their escape. But come morning most players will go out to mingle with others or simply collect resources. which would allow you to steal from a house or simply scout the area, but if you are looking into revenge as I have previously mentioned, a bucket of lava can go a long way. As I said previously a player will usually go out at day, which will provide you plenty of time to find and slaughter them, unless of course they are not alone.

[b]Don&#39;t go after a group of people[/b] Another key to being a good stalker is to go after targets individually, two people are more likely to win a fight than one. so only go after targets when they are alone, if someone is playing with a friend wait until he/she is alone. going after a group of people will only get you killed and possibly banned depending on the rules of the server.

[b]Follow the fucking rules[/b] Remember when I mentioned cities, they are there for a reason, and most of the time that reason is to provide a safe and friendly place to stay.

[b]Torches hate you, they will always hate you.[/b] Torches might keep the baddies away, but they also sell you out to the entire fucking world. Trying to sneak into a well lit base will usually get you caught, they also give out your base if you are not careful with them.

[b]stick to the shadows, and respect the shadows[/b] The darkness is a blanket for stalkers, a blanket that is choking you because it is tucked in way to tight. If you suddenly find a player returning to the house that you are stealing from then simply hide in the darkest corner you can find, and kill the player when he is in reach.

[b]Last but not least, get the fuck out of the crime scene.[/b] Just murdered your nemesis and burned down his home? Get as far away as possible, then lay low for a while. Try to return to base to unload all your goodies afterwards unless a player is near.

I hope this guide will help people who have fallen victim of stalkers, and help them get revenge once they have regained their bearings. Or, you know, just help people murder and rob someone they don&#39;t like.[/QUOTE]

&amp;#9773; ------------------ Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Minecraft Stalking Guide. ------------------- &amp;#9773;

For those of you who are fed up with constantly getting killed in SMP and want a little revenge.

[b]Now[/b], the most basic rule of stalking is sneaking. The shift key is not there to be pretty, especially in Minecraft. If you sneak your name tag will be hidden as long as you and your target are separated by a chunk, you can use this to your advantage, but so can your enemy, and that brings us to the second rule of stalking.

[b]Stay vigilant[/b] Any good stalker should know this. Everyone can use the shift key, now most players don&#39;t know that you can jump off ledges in sneak mode, same goes for jumping on ledges, so if you see a players name tag flash for a moment when they leave sneak to jump you know that they have less than lenient intentions. But when a better player is going after you they will usually stay in sneak when jumping, so always be prepared.

[b]Be prepared.[/b] Always have a weapon of some sort with you, even when you are safe in your home.
And always have armor when going after a target. If you are going to try and murder someone with a wooden sword and they have diamond armor then you might as well hug a creeper, sometimes you have to prepare yourself for a certain target and make weapons yourself.
Sometimes being prepared means having less items, if you are planning on going into combat you should store any valuables in a safe place. But prepare that safe place too. trying to hide a chest in a house by placing cobblestone or dirt in front of it is a giveaway towards burglars, use smoothstone in a natural house or whatever material blends into the wall.

[b]Keep your home hidden.[/b] If you plan on building a massive building do so in safe cities, almost every PVP server has one. But if you want to survive on the basics like a real SMP stalker then try to build your home as far away from the spawn as possible, if /sethome is non functional then use landmarks, build a simple landmark, some cobblestone resembling a compass with an extra block facing the spawn will do. Once you make your humble abode cover the entrance with materials that blend with the environment, leave an out of place block somewhere near the entrance. If you are building a house on flat land then you could place water blocks on the walls to slow any enemies, it will slow them to a crawl in sneak mode. Less experienced stalkers would loose patience and eventually stand revealing themselves to you.

[b]Have patience[/b] If you want a good clean kill then you must wait. Always wait until a player has their back turned to you when you go in for a kill, if they are mining you can run up behind them and kill them before they even see your name tag. If they are staring into the darkness looking for any predators find an alternate route or wait until they are not looking, if they spot you leave sneak mode and offer to trade or simply leave, act like you were not intending to end their life.

[b]Pick targets according to the time of day[/b] Most PVP servers also have PVE, preventing players from venturing into the night. Allowing you to kill someone in their own home and also preventing their escape. But come morning most players will go out to mingle with others or simply collect resources. which would allow you to steal from a house or simply scout the area, but if you are looking into revenge as I have previously mentioned, a bucket of lava can go a long way. As I said previously a player will usually go out at day, which will provide you plenty of time to find and slaughter them, unless of course they are not alone.

[b]Don&#39;t go after a group of people[/b] Another key to being a good stalker is to go after targets individually, two people are more likely to win a fight than one. so only go after targets when they are alone, if someone is playing with a friend wait until he/she is alone. going after a group of people will only get you killed and possibly banned depending on the rules of the server.

[b]Follow the fucking rules[/b] Remember when I mentioned cities, they are there for a reason, and most of the time that reason is to provide a safe and friendly place to stay.

[b]Torches hate you, they will always hate you.[/b] Torches might keep the baddies away, but they also sell you out to the entire fucking world. Trying to sneak into a well lit base will usually get you caught, they also give out your base if you are not careful with them.

[b]stick to the shadows, and respect the shadows[/b] The darkness is a blanket for stalkers, a blanket that is choking you because it is tucked in way to tight. If you suddenly find a player returning to the house that you are stealing from then simply hide in the darkest corner you can find, and kill the player when he is in reach.

[b]Last but not least, get the fuck out of the crime scene.[/b] Just murdered your nemesis and burned down his home? Get as far away as possible, then lay low for a while. Try to return to base to unload all your goodies afterwards unless a player is near.

I hope this guide will help people who have fallen victim of stalkers, and help them get revenge once they have regained their bearings. Or, you know, just help people murder and rob someone they don&#39;t like.[/QUOTE]

[quote]I present to you a guide on the humble art of Player vs. Player. This is by far my favorite mode, and presents a few strategies. Here is a simple list to start you off. Note that this guide is for solo fighters or small groups, about 1-4.

1. Never, ever trust anyone. Unless it is a close friend you know from real life or known for a while on the internet, don&#39;t trust them. Always be suspicious, but never tell anyone these suspicions.

2. Never keep all your valuables on your person, and likewise, never keep all your valuables in one chest. If someone kills you or finds this one chest, all your things are gone. Hide chests in clever places, like underwater or in dirt. Never, ever keep them in an open base. Surround them on all sides with blocks so x-ray texture packs can never see them. For ultimate security, hide it somewhere random, like three blocks down in some random mountain. Write the coordinates down (press F3 to see these coordinates) or put them in a txt file in case you forget.

3. Travel in groups if you are a group person. Let&#39;s say you actually have friends that you trust and they trust you. Two people with iron swords and leather armor will likely beat someone with diamond swords and iron armor. Group strategy is key when working in groups, and make sure you discuss any sensitive topics over /msg or /tell.

4. Make outposts everywhere. If you have a base you are going to infiltrate, make an outpost near it, but not too close. That way you can do recon and have a safe place for the night.

5. SNEAK WHENEVER POSSIBLE. If you are building something, sneak. Climbing a ladder? Sneak. Sneaking hides your name when behind blocks, and someone seeing you could attempt to find and kill you. It may be slower, but it pays off.

6. Make bases with an ambush in mind. Create secret shortcuts and tunnels to hide in, or make corners designed for counter-attacking. Branching paths help too, especially when you understand them.

7. If you see someone following you, never let them know you see them or turn around. You can walk around a corner, sneak, then ambush them when they come around this corner as well.

8. Camouflage. Make a skin that is a dark green with plenty of noise, or a dark grey if you mostly work and fight in caves. It will not hide the name tag, but sneaking does make your tag darker and more transparent, so camo could save your skin.

9. Bows and arrows are required. Get them as soon as possible. You can&#39;t harm anyone that isn&#39;t close to you, except with a bow and arrows.

10. Use recoil to your advantage. Arrows have good knockback, so use them if someone is near the edge of a cliff or lava.

11. Always have food on yourself. When two people come together to murder each other, they both can have full diamond armor and diamond swords, but the only variable is the amount of food or arrows. Stock up on both before a large fight or raid.

12. Always wear earphones or have speakers on. Without them, you could miss someone tunneling into your base and not be properly prepared.

13. If possible, choose the battlefield. If you have someone on their tail, lead them into an area you know, so you can hide in places you know of and such. Even better, combat-prepare your bases or locations of hiding by adding nooks and crannies, as well as shortcuts and secret tunnels, as stated before.

14. Never hesitate to run from a fight. There will always be someone smarter, stronger, or more prepared than you, and it is better to keep your equipment and run then stay and die against some person with diamond armor and swords.

15. When you lose, keep your cool. Never yell at someone and call them a &quot;n00b&quot; or any other insult, but congratulate them and keep your cool. You would be respected by many other users and look more mature than you may actually be.

16. Know thine enemy. If you know someone to sneak around and kill people, use that against them. Find ways to exploit people&#39;s strategies.

17. Create fear. People will be more nervous fighting you if you have a reputation for sneaking around and playing with your prey. With enough time and effort, you can get anyone to run away from you on sight.

18. Carry a stone or iron sword if you have the space. Along with being useful for killing friendly mobs instead of wasting diamond tools, you can bluff and make it seem as if you are weaker, causing others to engage you instead of cowering from your diamond tools.

19. Have your battle necessities in easy-to-reach spots. I would say having your sword at 4 on your hotbar, food at 5 and 6, bow at three, pickax at 2, and a shovel at 1.

20. Flint and steel are great for corridor combat. You can place some behind you and run, causing people to have to either spend time to put it out or run right through it, causing a waste of time or health.

21. Create efficient bases. Never make something in the open unless it is a trap. Hide your bases in mountainsides and under dirt, so no one can find it unless they dig there.

22. Making a mob trap is a great idea if you need to get food or leather quickly. All you need to do is place a single log on the ground and light the top on fire. It won&#39;t go out (in SMP) and during night, friendly mobs will spawn at it and kill themselves in the fire. Make sure you are nearby so these animals actually spawn.

23. Sneak through enemy bases. Always look for traps. The only way to trigger them is a pressure pad, so keep your eyes on the ground.

The most important tip: INTELLIGENCE IS KEY. A good ambush or trap is better than any diamond armor.

[quote]I present to you a guide on the humble art of Player vs. Player. This is by far my favorite mode, and presents a few strategies. Here is a simple list to start you off. Note that this guide is for solo fighters or small groups, about 1-4.

1. Never, ever trust anyone. Unless it is a close friend you know from real life or known for a while on the internet, don&#39;t trust them. Always be suspicious, but never tell anyone these suspicions.

2. Never keep all your valuables on your person, and likewise, never keep all your valuables in one chest. If someone kills you or finds this one chest, all your things are gone. Hide chests in clever places, like underwater or in dirt. Never, ever keep them in an open base. Surround them on all sides with blocks so x-ray texture packs can never see them. For ultimate security, hide it somewhere random, like three blocks down in some random mountain. Write the coordinates down (press F3 to see these coordinates) or put them in a txt file in case you forget.

3. Travel in groups if you are a group person. Let&#39;s say you actually have friends that you trust and they trust you. Two people with iron swords and leather armor will likely beat someone with diamond swords and iron armor. Group strategy is key when working in groups, and make sure you discuss any sensitive topics over /msg or /tell.

4. Make outposts everywhere. If you have a base you are going to infiltrate, make an outpost near it, but not too close. That way you can do recon and have a safe place for the night.

5. SNEAK WHENEVER POSSIBLE. If you are building something, sneak. Climbing a ladder? Sneak. Sneaking hides your name when behind blocks, and someone seeing you could attempt to find and kill you. It may be slower, but it pays off.

6. Make bases with an ambush in mind. Create secret shortcuts and tunnels to hide in, or make corners designed for counter-attacking. Branching paths help too, especially when you understand them.

7. If you see someone following you, never let them know you see them or turn around. You can walk around a corner, sneak, then ambush them when they come around this corner as well.

8. Camouflage. Make a skin that is a dark green with plenty of noise, or a dark grey if you mostly work and fight in caves. It will not hide the name tag, but sneaking does make your tag darker and more transparent, so camo could save your skin.

9. Bows and arrows are required. Get them as soon as possible. You can&#39;t harm anyone that isn&#39;t close to you, except with a bow and arrows.

10. Use recoil to your advantage. Arrows have good knockback, so use them if someone is near the edge of a cliff or lava.

11. Always have food on yourself. When two people come together to murder each other, they both can have full diamond armor and diamond swords, but the only variable is the amount of food or arrows. Stock up on both before a large fight or raid.

12. Always wear earphones or have speakers on. Without them, you could miss someone tunneling into your base and not be properly prepared.

13. If possible, choose the battlefield. If you have someone on their tail, lead them into an area you know, so you can hide in places you know of and such. Even better, combat-prepare your bases or locations of hiding by adding nooks and crannies, as well as shortcuts and secret tunnels, as stated before.

14. Never hesitate to run from a fight. There will always be someone smarter, stronger, or more prepared than you, and it is better to keep your equipment and run then stay and die against some person with diamond armor and swords.

15. When you lose, keep your cool. Never yell at someone and call them a &quot;n00b&quot; or any other insult, but congratulate them and keep your cool. You would be respected by many other users and look more mature than you may actually be.

16. Know thine enemy. If you know someone to sneak around and kill people, use that against them. Find ways to exploit people&#39;s strategies.

17. Create fear. People will be more nervous fighting you if you have a reputation for sneaking around and playing with your prey. With enough time and effort, you can get anyone to run away from you on sight.

18. Carry a stone or iron sword if you have the space. Along with being useful for killing friendly mobs instead of wasting diamond tools, you can bluff and make it seem as if you are weaker, causing others to engage you instead of cowering from your diamond tools.

19. Have your battle necessities in easy-to-reach spots. I would say having your sword at 4 on your hotbar, food at 5 and 6, bow at three, pickax at 2, and a shovel at 1.

20. Flint and steel are great for corridor combat. You can place some behind you and run, causing people to have to either spend time to put it out or run right through it, causing a waste of time or health.

21. Create efficient bases. Never make something in the open unless it is a trap. Hide your bases in mountainsides and under dirt, so no one can find it unless they dig there.

22. Making a mob trap is a great idea if you need to get food or leather quickly. All you need to do is place a single log on the ground and light the top on fire. It won&#39;t go out (in SMP) and during night, friendly mobs will spawn at it and kill themselves in the fire. Make sure you are nearby so these animals actually spawn.

23. Sneak through enemy bases. Always look for traps. The only way to trigger them is a pressure pad, so keep your eyes on the ground.

The most important tip: INTELLIGENCE IS KEY. A good ambush or trap is better than any diamond armor.

If you have any questions about SMP PvP, or need some strategy help, feel free to ask in this thread or over a PM.[/quote]
