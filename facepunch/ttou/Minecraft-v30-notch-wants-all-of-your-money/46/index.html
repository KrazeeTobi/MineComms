Ah, but you forget. Most of his time right now is being spent developing Survival Multiplayer. These &quot;Secret friday updates&quot;? They&#39;re filler. They&#39;re there so we don&#39;t get bored between now and Multiplayer&#39;s release.

Well I would have to disagree with you on that, but that&#39;s a different argument entirely. The point is that the base game is, in my opinion, not completely in tune, and I&#39;m quite certain there are people who agree with me. I could go on and on about how the terrain is sometimes impossible to navigate, how the hills occasionally become monotonous to explore, etc. I love this game and I&#39;m grateful Notch continues to pay attention to it, but I feel like certain additions, most of this last update in particular, are a case of misplaced effort.

The tunnel inside the inner walls leads into a 3-story deep fortress complete with magma furnace, tree farm, workshops, and dining rooms.
The tunnel on the far right leads out of the valley and onto a beach where I have this dock set up.

I plan to build a large ship in there somewhere.

The tunnel inside the inner walls leads into a 3-story deep fortress complete with magma furnace, tree farm, workshops, and dining rooms.
The tunnel on the far right leads out of the valley and onto a beach where I have this dock set up.

I&#39;m not trying to nitpick, you just keep insisting that my claim, that the base game isn&#39;t complete, isn&#39;t valid. None of these problems are game-breaking, but they are annoying and are encountered frequently (I suppose it could just be the way I play), and I feel like they warrant more attention than the game&#39;s dreaded lack of bookcases."

I&#39;m not trying to nitpick, you just keep insisting that my claim, that the base game isn&#39;t complete, isn&#39;t valid. None of these problems are game-breaking, but they are annoying and are encountered frequently (I suppose it could just be the way I play), and I feel like they warrant more attention than the game&#39;s dreaded lack of bookcases.</span>
