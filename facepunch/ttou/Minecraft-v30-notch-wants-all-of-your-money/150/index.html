&quot;Grifing&quot; and &quot;SMP&quot; should never be uttered in the same sentence really.

Survival Multiplayer is about survival, how someone goes about this is their choice. If someone wants to break into people&#39;s bases and steal some equipment or other stuff and possibly stay the night I don&#39;t see why their freedom to do this be revoked. This isn&#39;t griefing, it&#39;s a way to survive.

Now, towering above someones base with 20 buckets of lava and having them all dump onto the persons base offering no escape? I would call that griefing under MOST circumstances. 

You all are really just being whiny little care bears who just want to sit in safety and restrict other peoples fun."

&quot;Grifing&quot; and &quot;SMP&quot; should never be uttered in the same sentence really.

Survival Multiplayer is about survival, how someone goes about this is their choice. If someone wants to break into people&#39;s bases and steal some equipment or other stuff and possibly stay the night I don&#39;t see why their freedom to do this be revoked. This isn&#39;t griefing, it&#39;s a way to survive.

Now, towering above someones base with 20 buckets of lava and having them all dump onto the persons base offering no escape? I would call that griefing under MOST circumstances. 

You all are really just being whiny little care bears who just want to sit in safety and restrict other peoples fun.</span>

Oh, sorry, so when you stated that you had better things to do than sitting at your computer all night, you&#39;re actually just continuing to play the exact same game in a different mode.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Moreto;23658124]&quot;Grifing&quot; and &quot;SMP&quot; should never be uttered in the same sentence really.

Survival Multiplayer is about survival, how someone goes about this is their choice. If someone wants to break into people&#39;s bases and steal some equipment or other stuff and possibly stay the night I don&#39;t see why their freedom to do this be revoked. This isn&#39;t griefing, it&#39;s a way to survive.

Now, towering above someones base with 20 buckets of lava and having them all dump onto the persons base offering no escape? I would call that griefing under MOST circumstances. 

You all are really just being whiny little care bears who just want to sit in safety and restrict other peoples fun.[/QUOTE]

If the game is about survival, there wouldn&#39;t be any need to destroy another person property or steal their things for no clear reason. A way to survive is just a poor excuse -- you can [B]GIVE PEOPLE ITEMS[/B] there should be [B]NO EXCUSE[/B] as to why you went into their home and stole everything when you just could have asked them to help them get a jumpstart.</span>

I got onto SMP 4 times earlier, and played all that I wanted to. I never waited longer than 5 minutes to connect, and was playing ROTMG on my laptop while the script was running.

I never said you couldn&#39;t do it, I just said it&#39;d be called griefing if you did. If someone is trying to build their base and you are destroying their base that is griefing and there is no two ways about it. There aren&#39;t any layers of depth in it. It&#39;s what you do in creative if you want to grief and it translates over to SMP in the same manner.

It all boils down to the server you join. If the rules say no killing/stealing, you should probably refrain from killing or stealing. If it says do whatever, then you can do whatever."
