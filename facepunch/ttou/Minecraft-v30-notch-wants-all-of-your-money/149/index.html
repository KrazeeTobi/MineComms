If you aren&#39;t part of the solution you&#39;re part of the problem, and you definitely aren&#39;t part of the solution. Why should you get any better chance of playing the beta than the rest of us? The servers are full and the person who gets in is someone using a macro to do it?

It all boils down to how fast your internet is and how good your connection is compared to X,000 other people who are doing the exact same thing. I&#39;d rather not try to play SMP at all than play knowing there are thousands of people cheating to get in first.[/QUOTE]

If you aren&#39;t part of the solution you&#39;re part of the problem, and you definitely aren&#39;t part of the solution. Why should you get any better chance of playing the beta than the rest of us? The servers are full and the person who gets in is someone using a macro to do it?

SMP&#39;s a bad idea because everyone&#39;s got it in their head that griefing will add fun to the game.</span>

Even though you&#39;re a great example, it doesn&#39;t have much to do with you. For example, if Daijitsu decided to stop being a moderator, nobody would listen to him, and he most certainly wouldn&#39;t getting be worshiped and praised like he does now.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=WolfeClaw;23658059]Fair enough, there are some decent people, but the rest are pure pricks. Did I mention that there are hardly any decent people that are from /v/? No? Well, it&#39;s true.[/QUOTE]

4chan in general can be a bunch of pricks. I know a few other /v/ friends, and while we joke around a lot, we are still nice guys. People over react when they hear /v/, or 4chan in general, but I can see why.</span>
