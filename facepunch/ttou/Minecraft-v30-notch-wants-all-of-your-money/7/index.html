Notch said that he isn&#39;t going to worry too much about copy protection, as it would be at the expense of developing for the people that paid for it. Tons of people have purchased and love the game, even if a few accounts are shared."

you see these notices on sites all the time. They &quot;Can&#39;t be held responsible if their users perform the action illegally, the service is legal on those terms&quot; blah blah blah.[/QUOTE]

that&#39;s a really common misconception, but you are not entitled to any sort of second copy or license, physical or digital unless expressly stated by the manufacturer, and it would still be illegal to torrent in that case because of the P2P aspect of it.
