If you want to play survival then you will be stuck with two options: become a faggot pirate or just make due with creative. Do you want this to happen?[/QUOTE]

oh my fucking god are you kidding me

notch could pretty much retire at this point from all the moneys hes gotten, and i remember reading something about him quitting his job to work on minecraft. if you actually think that notch is going to quit development on minecraft you&#39;re truly stupid cause notch has said time and time again that piracy doesn&#39;t really bother him."

put yourself in notchs shoes, you spent countless hours working on this game ALONE, you quit your job to work on this game cause your that confident that minecraft will be successful, and about 34,000 people payed 10 dollars for it, BUT you just decide to cancel all development on it just because a few thousand people downloaded your game.

I&#39;d be pretty pissed yeah, but jesus you can&#39;t read, he didn&#39;t say Notch would cancel development all he said was that he&#39;d stop alpha/infdev while he carries on making the game, so all we have to play is creative."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Kid Cudi;23562149]holy shit 

i said it once and pieclock said it as well, but let me say it again:

notch doesnt give a fuck about piracy, and another thing

put yourself in notchs shoes, you spent countless hours working on this game ALONE and about 34,000 people payed 10 dollars for it, and your just about to cancel all development on it just because a few thousand people downloaded your game.


does that really sound plausible?[/QUOTE]

I&#39;d be pretty pissed yeah, but jesus you can&#39;t read, he didn&#39;t say Notch would cancel development all he said was that he&#39;d stop alpha/infdev while he carries on making the game, so all we have to play is creative.</span>
