                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=AgentBoomstick;24766170]Alright everybody, the gig is up. We first staged the picture and edited out the name (which everybody was doing). We thought it would be awesome to FILM Herobrine and have him shoot around a corner and respawn to make it look like he disappeared. It worked awesome, but we needed to edit out the named of the person staging it. We planned it out extremely well. We had people talking about Herobrine in the chat, we had one of our friends download the skin and fly around a corner on my queue, it was great. Until it came to the editing. The plan was to record a scene without anybody in it, to be able to mask out the name. Then we recorded a friend and I went HOLY SHIT IT&#39;S HEROBRINE NOBODY MOVE. They all played along and said things like &quot;No, you&#39;re trolling&quot;, etc. Then I got to editing it, and I was just too lazy, and the videos were too off sync to get anything believable done. The jigs up, Herobrine is not real. Everybody on Hangover&#39;s server played along with it, and we actually got some people to believe :smug:
