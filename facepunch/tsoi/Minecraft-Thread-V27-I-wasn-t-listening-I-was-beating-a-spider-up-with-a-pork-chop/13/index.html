it tends to be more stable when they are stacked, i have had my negative durability suddenly disappear a couple times when i was moving it around.

Hold punch on a tree. Take the wood, press &quot;I&quot; and put it in the four square box. Take the crafted wood out and put 4 in a square in the square box. You now have a workbench. Put the workbench down on the ground and right click it. Now you should see a 3x3 square.

If you want to mine, make a pickaxe, if you want to chop moar trees, axe (you can make as many as you want.)

One fine day, out in the countryside, I was building a few structures at the bottom of the cliff which my castle was perched upon. The creepers were asleep (most likely in my mines), so I didn&#39;t have a care in the world. The pigs and the sheep watched curiously as I went about constructing my constructions. It was a rather productive day for me, and I had built a large statue and an aqueduct which would provide fresh water to my castle from a nearby mountain spring, all before noon. 

Feeling energized by my accomplishments, I began construction of a fiendish device, a most fiendish device indeed. It was designed to trap wandering creatures and, using the power of water currents, pull them down into a flooded basin. Their lungs would fill with water and they would asphyxiate, causing them to drop all of their worldly belongings. The water current would pull these items through a small gap further into the device, where they would be deposited for easy collection. 

After many test runs and near-death experiences later, the device was complete. I sat in a nearby tree and waited for my first victim. Mere minutes later, my wait was over. A lone sheep came along and, apparently interested by the mysterious new construction, promptly jumped into the water current. I hopped down and eagerly awaited the inevitable, but the sheep would not give in so easily. He summoned all of his sheepish strength in an effort to outswim the current, but it was to no avail. Slowly but surely, he neared the pit which would mean his demise. Just before being pulled under, he turned around and looked me straight in the eyes, as if to say...

[i]&quot;How could you?&quot;[/i]

I watched in horror as he drowned and ran around to the other side of the device, the collection area. 3 blocks of soft, white wool floated out and landed on the ground at my feet. I gave a salute to the strong hero, a sheep who I have named &quot;Thomas&quot;. I picked up the wool and built a shrine in his honor on the hills on which he used to jump and play. 

Let this shrine serve as a beacon of hope for generations to come.

I know, it only started happening when I switched to hosting it off dropbox, I&#39;m gonna try to fix it.
Server is back up, don&#39;t know if that fixed it, but I&#39;m changing the ports to default ones tommorow.
