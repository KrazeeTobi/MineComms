Allow my [I]PATENTED[/I] sales pitch* to help convince you to buy it ASAP:

/game/ is the newest and FINAL paid-only in development version. It has infinite terrain (don&#39;t let anyone tell you otherwise), animals, enemies, a day/night cycle, and damn near infinite replayability. You start out punching trees down with your bare hands, and craft blocks into tools like swords and axes and other things like chests and furnaces, where you can smelt ores into usable materials. You can kill pigs for their pork, hit sheep to make their wool fly off, and even get milk from cows.

At night, however, the enemies come out, and their only purpose is to completely wreck your shit and murder you. Any enemy that finds you will make a beeline for you and you&#39;ll have to either run away or kill it. There are a handful of different enemies, like the exploding creeper or the fierce spider.

Basically, you mine and craft, just like the game says. It&#39;s a ton of fun and I recommend it to anyone, really. You don&#39;t need a superior computer to run it, and it&#39;s got really polished graphics.

That&#39;s my official &quot;sales pitch&quot; but you won&#39;t really know for sure unless you try it out. Even if you don&#39;t like it, you&#39;ll be able to do all the stuff I just described and more with friends when you play Survival Multiplayer. The price will double when it gets finished, so I assure you it&#39;s a better deal to get it now. I can definitely say you won&#39;t regret it.

It&#39;s a definite PROBABLY right now. I say PROBABLY because some (like me for example) don&#39;t want Notch to do it, but most do, and Notch himself wants to, so, y&#39;know, he&#39;ll probably do it."

No I&#39;m not. I called you a douchebag, not an elitist prick. The difference being that now you&#39;re doing it just to make people mad that they don&#39;t have the IP to the server, and even though I DO have the IP* to the server, I&#39;m still pissed off about it just like anyone else.

Its not being a douchebag, what has your problem been lately?[/QUOTE]

I try to be nice, I really do, but lately I really just don&#39;t give a shit because I have more important things in my life to worry about than people arguing like children 24/7 about Minecraft. I don&#39;t care what you or Venn or whoever thinks, you can&#39;t stop me from being mad by just telling me to stop being mad. The Minecraft community used to be good, but suddenly it went to shit and now we&#39;ve spent a solid three threads bickering about whose IP is given to who or why the game doesn&#39;t have this or this or it&#39;s all Notch&#39;s fault for not releasing the client when it&#39;s finished or blah blah blah and I want to know why, but nobody is willing to tell me because they&#39;re too busy with their stupid drama. I don&#39;t care if this is the most popular megathread on FP, it&#39;s not an excuse for letting the community&#39;s quality drop like a rock. This game used to be about building cool shit with your friends, but now it&#39;s about how many people you&#39;re letting into your &quot;exclusive SMP community&quot; and posting whitelists and blacklists and every color of list so that everyone knows just who can and can&#39;t join."

Its not being a douchebag, what has your problem been lately?[/QUOTE]

I try to be nice, I really do, but lately I really just don&#39;t give a shit because I have more important things in my life to worry about than people arguing like children 24/7 about Minecraft. I don&#39;t care what you or Venn or whoever thinks, you can&#39;t stop me from being mad by just telling me to stop being mad. The Minecraft community used to be good, but suddenly it went to shit and now we&#39;ve spent a solid three threads bickering about whose IP is given to who or why the game doesn&#39;t have this or this or it&#39;s all Notch&#39;s fault for not releasing the client when it&#39;s finished or blah blah blah and I want to know why, but nobody is willing to tell me because they&#39;re too busy with their stupid drama. I don&#39;t care if this is the most popular megathread on FP, it&#39;s not an excuse for letting the community&#39;s quality drop like a rock. This game used to be about building cool shit with your friends, but now it&#39;s about how many people you&#39;re letting into your &quot;exclusive SMP community&quot; and posting whitelists and blacklists and every color of list so that everyone knows just who can and can&#39;t join.</span>

View of my empire through the eyes of skullfucker castle. (Not pictured, my giant cobblestone tower that reaches the top of the skybox, because it&#39;s just outside the draw distance.)

Took me a good few hours to make. The only thing I cheated with was the obsidian, because fuck mining precisely 203 blocks of that stuff. Built the whole thing by hand. Really pleased with how it turned out.

View of my empire through the eyes of skullfucker castle. (Not pictured, my giant cobblestone tower that reaches the top of the skybox, because it&#39;s just outside the draw distance.)

Took me a good few hours to make. The only thing I cheated with was the obsidian, because fuck mining precisely 203 blocks of that stuff. Built the whole thing by hand. Really pleased with how it turned out.
