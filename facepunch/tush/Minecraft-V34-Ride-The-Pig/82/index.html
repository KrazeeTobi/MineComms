You are not spelunking enough.

Step 1: Mass on torches (about 30-50) and a few rock pickaxes. A couple of swords too.
Step 2: Find cave entrance on the surface.
Step 3: Check cave size from the entrance, if it leads further underground, go to step 4, if not return to step 2.
Step 4: Start exploring the cave while placing torches to light your path and mark the way out and killing monsters.
Step 5: Find plenty iron ore and mine it. If you don&#39;t, return to step 2.
Step 6: Gather iron, torches and all the resources you found and leave the cave system."

Seriously? How about you try and give me a cohesive response trying to prove me wrong instead of going with the other countless other people who have responded to me with a sentence or less. 

I am not trying to start a fight.

I am not trying to cause drama.

I want an explanation for the shit that is going on, whether it may be a minor happening or a major one, and why nobody wishes to place their opinion as well. We need to stop idolizing Notch, as somebody else also said, and give him criticism. I know, life is tough. Maybe you don&#39;t want to see reality within this thread, maybe you want to cling to your secure future in having patience and waiting for updates that may come, in a year or so. But whenever life gives me a chance to argue for what I believe needs to be done, I shall do so.

What I want to see is people actually responding, giving a good argument for why they think it&#39;s either a good or bad thing that he is pursuing. All I see now is complacent fuckers sitting in front of a screen writing a few words while their money is squandered around because they do not wish to fight for what is rightfully theirs. You get absolutely no respect from me when you cannot even pull of some High School level coherent and useful response."

I want an explanation for the shit that is going on, whether it may be a minor happening or a major one, and why nobody wishes to place their opinion as well.

What I want to see is people actually responding, giving a good argument for why they think it&#39;s either a good or bad thing that he is pursuing.

I am not trying to start a fight.

I am not trying to cause drama.

I want an explanation for the shit that is going on, whether it may be a minor happening or a major one, and why nobody wishes to place their opinion as well. We need to stop idolizing Notch, as somebody else also said, and give him criticism. I know, life is tough. Maybe you don&#39;t want to see reality within this thread, maybe you want to cling to your secure future in having patience and waiting for updates that may come, in a year or so. But whenever life gives me a chance to argue for what I believe needs to be done, I shall do so.

What I want to see is people actually responding, giving a good argument for why they think it&#39;s either a good or bad thing that he is pursuing. All I see now is complacent fuckers sitting in front of a screen writing a few words while their money is squandered around because they do not wish to fight for what is rightfully theirs. You get absolutely no respect from me when you cannot even pull of some High School level coherent and useful response.[/QUOTE]

I am not trying to start a fight.

I am not trying to cause drama.

I want an explanation for the shit that is going on, whether it may be a minor happening or a major one, and why nobody wishes to place their opinion as well. We need to stop idolizing Notch, as somebody else also said, and give him criticism. I know, life is tough. Maybe you don&#39;t want to see reality within this thread, maybe you want to cling to your secure future in having patience and waiting for updates that may come, in a year or so. But whenever life gives me a chance to argue for what I believe needs to be done, I shall do so.

What I want to see is people actually responding, giving a good argument for why they think it&#39;s either a good or bad thing that he is pursuing. All I see now is complacent fuckers sitting in front of a screen writing a few words while their money is squandered around because they do not wish to fight for what is rightfully theirs. You get absolutely no respect from me when you cannot even pull of some High School level coherent and useful response.[/QUOTE]

Want a response then how about this.

I don&#39;t idolize Notch, I happen to think he is doing well with his game though and deserves some amount of respect. He has been away the past week or so which means clearly no update which he even told us. He also said don&#39;t expect much from SMP as he rushed it for us before he went away.

As for the Friday update being cancelled I am pissed off, like many, but it&#39;s not the end of the fucking world.

Christ.

Also why would anyone give a shit if you respected them or not?"
