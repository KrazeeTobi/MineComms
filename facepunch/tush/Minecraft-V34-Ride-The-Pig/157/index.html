This should really be the last post on the matter

Don&#39;t reply to it with a retarded argument, this thread is about the magical game of MINECRAFT

Speaking of which, does anyone else have it where during nights the game spawns pretty much creepers and nothing else on the overworld?

It kinda creeps me out knowing that there&#39;s 30 creepers outside my house that I have to deal with in the morning

[QUOTE=Kontradaz;24115961]You brought this shit here when you wrote your failed attempt at getting some sort of respect. This is the type of blind ignorance that just gets the fuck on your nerves, you have absolutely no counter-argument to me basically telling you your future is shit, aside from telling me that you don&#39;t need to listen to me; you are just another example of a kid fucking himself over with his extremely fragile and not reasonable academic plans while ignoring everyone who even tries to reason with him.[/QUOTE]

Dude, shut up
