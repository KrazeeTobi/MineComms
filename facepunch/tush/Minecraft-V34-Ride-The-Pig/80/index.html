[code]Competition entries:
I really like the Java 4K [Game] Programming Contest, and have entered seven games so far:
MEG4kMAN (2009), a Mega Man clone featuring very old school graphics.
Left 4k Dead (2009), a zombie shooter game inspired by Left 4 Dead.
t4kns (2008), a real time strategy game.
Miners4k (2006), a game kinda inspired by lemmings and diggers. It won the 2006 competition!
[MISSING] Hunters4k (2005), a first person shooter.
[MISSING] Dungeon4k (2005), a dungeon exploration game.
Sonic Racer 4k (2005), a racing game with stolen sprites. I lost the source code for this.
I also made a game called Dachon4k, a gravity based shooter, but I never entered it.
Oh, and I forgot about l4krits, a luxor clone, that I never entered either.
I made Blast Passage, an 8-Bit mashup between Bomberman and Gauntlet for the 2008 Retro Remakes competition.

I sometimes enter the Ludum Dare competition.
Most recently, I made Bunny Press, a somewhat violent puzzle game.
The first time I competed, I made a game called Breaking the Tower in 48 hours. It&#39;s not a bad game! It finished third in the LD12 competiton.
There&#39;s the Infinite Mario Bros game I wrote for some mario themed competition. The source code is public domain now!
2.5d Engines:
I started work on an rpg called Legend of the Chambered, but lost interest for some reason.
I made a first person shooter prototype in flash. It uses graphics from the freedoom project.
There&#39;s also a flash doom level renderer. It doesn&#39;t have any fancy textures, though.
I also wrote a dungeon master type game engine in java using similar techniques. I also have a DM engine in flash, but that one uses static graphics.
Even nerdier:
I made a turing complete hexagon based cellular automata thingie. It&#39;s REALLY nerdy.
And then I started making a 40x30 pixel ega color remake of Eye of the Beholder 2. I should finish it.[/code]

His old jobs: 
[code]I used to work for Jalbum as a programmer. Or developer. Or code guru. We got to pick our own titles. :D

Before that, I worked for King.com as a game programmer for 4.5 years. I wrote games like Funny Farm, Luxor, and Carnival Shootout. I mostly did actionscript programming there, but also some java for the game verification code.
Recently, I&#39;ve done some work in C++. It&#39;s a powerful language and fun, but the retarded compilation system makes me cry a bit.

I was one of the founders of a unique mmorpg called Wurm Online. I&#39;m no longer active there.
I also make music under the name Markus Alexei. It&#39;s electronica, and releases are very far apart.[/code]"

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Kontradaz;24037360]Who really gives a shit? There are far more important things to fix within SMP now than trying to add more things which would only act to make shit more unstable than it already is. I am telling you, this is a plain case of focusing more and more on extra, needless for the moment, things while those that need improvement and bug-fixing are left uncovered.[/QUOTE]

I honestly think SMP isn&#39;t that bad how it is now, and you&#39;re just whining. Let Notch update what he wants, when he wants. :colbert:

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Kontradaz;24037466]Sorry if I am not part of this group that wishes to wank over Notch&#39;s updates or failures as if they were all right all the fucking time. I have the damn right to complain if I want, and I don&#39;t care what you guys wish to think about how things are going but there is absolutely no denial that he is focusing on the wrong things. 

Had he not been pushed around by idiots who wanted Biomes and whatever else crazy shit that can be created later down the road, maybe he would have released something rational today. But no, everyfuckingbody wants to have a damn biome because that&#39;s all that&#39;s important today.

He may have all of next week to work on SMP, but what fucking invisible barrier blocked him from ironing out some critical issues today? Mistaken priorities, that&#39;s all.[/QUOTE]

Your priority is to get the fuck out of this thread.



Gah shit, resist.</span>
