Eventually the game lost it&amp;#8217;s fire. I created everything I had wanted to and become bored. I stopped playing for a while and every now and then I would go to minecraft.net and check out what&amp;#8217;s going on and maybe play on some servers for a few minutes. 
	Cut to one week ago. August 4th, 2010. I decided to drop by and see what&amp;#8217;s up on Notch&amp;#8217;s blog and whatnot. I see that there was a new version of the game called Survival. I also noticed that Notch had added a downloadable client (the one thing I had always wanted with Minecraft, in-browser play was dumb). I decided to download it and found it highly enjoyable. I was playing for three or four hours at a time, mining deep down and creating endless tunnels, crafting, smelting, farming, etc. This game was perfect. I read Notch&amp;#8217;s blog and found something about an &amp;#8220;SMP server&amp;#8221;. I had no idea what this was. When I found out it was Survival Multiplayer I was ecstatic. This was a great idea. 
	Fast forward to now. I want to experience SMP. I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find any decent SMP servers. As I browse FacePunch, I only hear positive things about the Nerdy server. My one wish since I was a child was to be apart of your server, and if you deny my application you will be denying my dream.

I bought the game for $9.99 and thought it was amazingly priced. The fact that I would get all future versions of the game was appealing as well.
Eventually the game lost it&amp;#8217;s fire. I created everything I had wanted to and become bored. I stopped playing for a while and every now and then I would go to minecraft.net and check out what&amp;#8217;s going on and maybe play on some servers for a few minutes. 
	Cut to one week ago. August 4th, 2010. I decided to drop by and see what&amp;#8217;s up on Notch&amp;#8217;s blog and whatnot. I see that there was a new version of the game called Survival. I also noticed that Notch had added a downloadable client (the one thing I had always wanted with Minecraft, in-browser play was dumb). I decided to download it and found it highly enjoyable. I was playing for three or four hours at a time, mining deep down and creating endless tunnels, crafting, smelting, farming, etc. This game was perfect. I read Notch&amp;#8217;s blog and found something about an &amp;#8220;SMP server&amp;#8221;. I had no idea what this was. When I found out it was Survival Multiplayer I was ecstatic. This was a great idea. 
	Fast forward to now. I want to experience SMP. I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find any decent SMP servers. As I browse FacePunch, I only hear positive things about the Nerdy server. My one wish since I was a child was to be apart of your server, and if you deny my application you will be denying my dream.

Lol. Little too long. Just wanted a paragraph. 4-8 sentences on why you want to come in and what you will contribute.

You are approved but I need to sleep so in the morning I will put you in.
