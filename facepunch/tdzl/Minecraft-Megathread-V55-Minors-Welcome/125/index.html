Ever since I posted that, I have continuously found more and more dungeons on the surface. But yet I have never found the elusive creeper spawner. I shall continue my search! And your right. It does make you feel like your excavating some age old lost temple or something. I like it. :v:</span>

I was wondering what would happen to the gameplay if resources were a lot more area specific. Like dropping the ore spawn rate in temperate zones and boosting them in mountain-cold zones and desert-hot zones.
But then also making the temperature extreme zones a bit more dangerous and less suitable for fancy, richly colored buildings.

This way, mining becomes less guesswork and more of a process.



Also, I still long for super expanded biomes, that literally take days (1 or more) to cross. Anyone got a fix for this?"

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Mr Shadyface;27731861]Is there [i]any[/i] way to find iron and other ores other than sheer dumb luck? I have been digging tunnels EVERYWHERE and all i can find is coal, gravel and water.[/QUOTE]
 
I was wondering what would happen to the gameplay if resources were a lot more area specific. Like dropping the ore spawn rate in temperate zones and boosting them in mountain-cold zones and desert-hot zones.
But then also making the temperature extreme zones a bit more dangerous and less suitable for fancy, richly colored buildings.

This way, mining becomes less guesswork and more of a process.



Also, I still long for super expanded biomes, that literally take days (1 or more) to cross. Anyone got a fix for this?</span>

Well the textures in the game have twice as many pixels as the one one the main characters face. I&#39;m not talking about extreme detail, just adding a little bit more room for creativity.

Hell, even if he added a single more pixel in the face we could have noses."

Well the textures in the game have twice as many pixels as the one one the main characters face. I&#39;m not talking about extreme detail, just adding a little bit more room for creativity.

Hell, even if he added a single more pixel in the face we could have noses.</span>

Wow, so you people really find mining for hours, to find diamonds, to add to your collection of 300. Apparently now you feel it necessary to post it on Facepunch to show off your e-penis only to find someone that has more diamonds than you. Honestly, what makes Minecraft so fun to you?  Is it the constant building of buildings smoothing out the imperfections, then posting it on Facepunch so that one person may rate you artistic so you can squeal in glee at how much that one person loves your building enough to rate you the coveted artistic. I&#39;ve scanned through this thread and find that most of the posts regard setting up their server, showing off their generic houses, and asking other players what their texture pack is. It seems to me that it&#39;s not Minecraft its&#39; self, but the need to post your experience with Minecraft that everybody has already had multitudes of times just so that you can feel content with your poor decision of giving notch 10 dollars. What gets me, you all treat notch like he is a fucking god, well he&#39;s a pretty lazy god, maybe he should work for valve where he&#39;s more suited."
