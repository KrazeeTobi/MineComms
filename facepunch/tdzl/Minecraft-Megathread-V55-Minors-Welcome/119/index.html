                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=Doomish;27694338]So I&#39;m having an argument with a guy that doesn&#39;t like Minecraft.

[code]Lumenshroom: y u liek miencrafte
Lumenshroom: it&#39;s so
Lumenshroom: confused feeling
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: how so?
Lumenshroom: well
Lumenshroom: uhm
Lumenshroom: as i see it, survival is a sort of splicing between &quot;create&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t get killed&quot; and &quot;explore&quot; objectives, but it only succeeds in watering each of them down due to the others being limiters
Lumenshroom: for example, the compases point to the goddamn spawn instead of some placeable block, so you can never find your house, so exploration is impossible without getting lost, and creation is limited by making you harvest shit for hours at a time
Lumenshroom: which means buildings are only impressive because it took SO LONG to build them, kinda like how paintings would be cooler if they were made w/ an eyelash and a can of nail polish
Lumenshroom: and survival isn&#39;t really survival considering how easy it is
Lumenshroom: so yeah]
Lumenshroom: that stuff
Lumenshroom: it needs a clear objective (and don&#39;t say &quot;no it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s a sandbox&quot;, sandboxes require guidance)
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it has a clear objective right now
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: two actually
Lumenshroom: which ones
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: the first is building a portal, which requires you to get diamond, which requires you to get iron, which requires you to get stone, which requires you to make a pickaxe, which requires wood, etc.
Lumenshroom: the nether is not so important that it is a &quot;clear objective&quot; imo
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it&#39;s not about the nether
Lumenshroom: and even if it is, what do you do after you&#39;ve gone to the nether
Lumenshroom: i mean, it&#39;s not that interesting in there
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it doesn&#39;t matter, when you spawn, you basically need to do everything the game has to offer to get the obsidian for a portal
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it still constitutes as a goal
Lumenshroom: i expected big, awesome caverns filled with diamond and shit but i got gigantic lakes of lava and fireball throwing cacodemons impeding my exploration
Lumenshroom: was a disappointment
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it&#39;s hell, what else would you expect
Lumenshroom: uh
Lumenshroom: it&#39;s bad game design, regardless of what you call it
Lumenshroom: if you are a game designer, one of your most important tools is critical thinking, and I don&#39;t think Notch is thinking critically
Lumenshroom: minecraft has no direction
Lumenshroom: sandboxes need some form of linearity aside from &quot;harvest these blocks so you can harvest better blocks&quot;
Lumenshroom: well minecraft what happens when i have the best blocks
Lumenshroom: boring
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: you make cool looking and creative stuff
Lumenshroom: why bother when you could do it in creative
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it&#39;s not about having the &quot;best blocks&quot; or whathaveyou, it&#39;s about making stuff that looks good using what you have
Lumenshroom: so
Lumenshroom: you&#39;re saying
Lumenshroom: that the objective, even in survival, is building things
Lumenshroom: even though it&#39;s called survival
Lumenshroom: you&#39;re admitting it&#39;s a confused game
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: uh
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: no
Lumenshroom: yeah
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: don&#39;t put words in my mouth pal
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: survival is survival, you do all that stuff while balancing enemy battles
Lumenshroom: &quot;it&#39;s about building cool things regardless of what you have&quot;
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: you even quoted me wrong :|
Lumenshroom: sounds like you&#39;re backpedaling tbh
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: i haven&#39;t backpedaled anywhere, i&#39;ve been saying the same thing since the beginning of the conversation
Lumenshroom: no you haven&#39;t lol
Lumenshroom: beginning of conversation = &quot;minecraft has lots of objectives! getting portal materials... and uh...&quot;,  end of conversation = &quot;minecraft&#39;s objective is to build things with what you have&quot;
Lumenshroom: that sounds a lot like backpedaling
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: once again, i never said the objective was to build cool things
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: i said that was what the game was about
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: even since creative that&#39;s what the game has been about
Lumenshroom: gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it&#39;s not about having the &quot;best blocks&quot; or whathaveyou, it&#39;s about making stuff that looks good using what you have
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: yes, i said that
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: ok
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: and i just said it again
Lumenshroom: the objective IS &quot;what the game is about&quot;
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: no it isn&#39;t, objectives are different than the game&#39;s purpose
Lumenshroom: unless you mean theme or something which is retarded because minecraft doesn&#39;t tell a story
Lumenshroom: at all
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: minecraft doesn&#39;t have a story, it&#39;s YOUR story, you make it with your experience
Lumenshroom: this is sounding more and more like a shitty RPG advert
Lumenshroom: something i&#39;d read in an ad for Aeion or whatever
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: you don&#39;t have to find dungeons or make portals or anything, you can cheat in all your materials if you want to, the game is fun because you can do whatever you want to
Lumenshroom: or second life
Lumenshroom: LOL
Lumenshroom: &quot;the game is fun because you do lots of stuff&quot;
Lumenshroom: that&#39;s not the criteria a game has to meet to make it &quot;good&quot;
Lumenshroom: fallout 3 let you do lots of stuff but it was also structured and allowed for linear play if the player wanted that
Lumenshroom: minecraft dumps you into a randomly generated pile of blocks and says &quot;do shit&quot;
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: oh my god did you really just try to compare fallout 3 to minecraft
Lumenshroom: yes
Lumenshroom: actually no lol
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: they are completely different games in concept, gameplay, and general plot and you just tried to compare them
Lumenshroom: you said that miencraft is good because it lets you do lots of different things, so i gave an example of a game which lets you do lots of things but is actually GOOD
Lumenshroom: also &quot;general plot lol
Lumenshroom: please explain to me minecraft&#39;s plot
Lumenshroom: leave no stone unturned and fill in all the plot holes!!
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: alright, here is the extent of minecraft&#39;s plot
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: give me a second, this is going to take a bit
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: &quot;you are a player who is dumped in a world that is as big as your hard drive space, and you have to get the materials necessary to make any kind of structure or shelter you want to while defending yourself from the hordes of monsters that spawn at night (this is of course optional as the game offers a difficulty setting that makes them all but vanish)&quot;
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: simple, easy
Lumenshroom: that&#39;s not a plot
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it was sarcasm
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: no shit it doesn&#39; t have a plot
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: the game has no directions or goals and that&#39;s the point of it
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: you can do literally whatever you want
Lumenshroom: you&#39;re
Lumenshroom: uh
Lumenshroom: forgetting why i brought that uop
Lumenshroom: you said fallout 3 and minecraft have &quot;way different general plots&quot;
Lumenshroom: pretty fucking dumb claim considering minecraft doesn&#39;t have one
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it doesn&#39;t matter either way, they&#39;re still completely different games
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: that only helps my argument :|
Lumenshroom: what
Lumenshroom: that&#39;s not even
Lumenshroom: i&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve been led so far down the rabbit hole we&#39;ve forgotten our points
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: i&#39;m still on my point, you&#39;ve gotten far off from yours
Lumenshroom: anyway, minecraft needs an objective if it wants to be taken seriously
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: mine is that minecraft is a good game and it doesn&#39;t need direction to be good

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Doomish;27694338]So I&#39;m having an argument with a guy that doesn&#39;t like Minecraft.

[code]Lumenshroom: y u liek miencrafte
Lumenshroom: it&#39;s so
Lumenshroom: confused feeling
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: how so?
Lumenshroom: well
Lumenshroom: uhm
Lumenshroom: as i see it, survival is a sort of splicing between &quot;create&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t get killed&quot; and &quot;explore&quot; objectives, but it only succeeds in watering each of them down due to the others being limiters
Lumenshroom: for example, the compases point to the goddamn spawn instead of some placeable block, so you can never find your house, so exploration is impossible without getting lost, and creation is limited by making you harvest shit for hours at a time
Lumenshroom: which means buildings are only impressive because it took SO LONG to build them, kinda like how paintings would be cooler if they were made w/ an eyelash and a can of nail polish
Lumenshroom: and survival isn&#39;t really survival considering how easy it is
Lumenshroom: so yeah]
Lumenshroom: that stuff
Lumenshroom: it needs a clear objective (and don&#39;t say &quot;no it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s a sandbox&quot;, sandboxes require guidance)
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it has a clear objective right now
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: two actually
Lumenshroom: which ones
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: the first is building a portal, which requires you to get diamond, which requires you to get iron, which requires you to get stone, which requires you to make a pickaxe, which requires wood, etc.
Lumenshroom: the nether is not so important that it is a &quot;clear objective&quot; imo
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it&#39;s not about the nether
Lumenshroom: and even if it is, what do you do after you&#39;ve gone to the nether
Lumenshroom: i mean, it&#39;s not that interesting in there
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it doesn&#39;t matter, when you spawn, you basically need to do everything the game has to offer to get the obsidian for a portal
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it still constitutes as a goal
Lumenshroom: i expected big, awesome caverns filled with diamond and shit but i got gigantic lakes of lava and fireball throwing cacodemons impeding my exploration
Lumenshroom: was a disappointment
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it&#39;s hell, what else would you expect
Lumenshroom: uh
Lumenshroom: it&#39;s bad game design, regardless of what you call it
Lumenshroom: if you are a game designer, one of your most important tools is critical thinking, and I don&#39;t think Notch is thinking critically
Lumenshroom: minecraft has no direction
Lumenshroom: sandboxes need some form of linearity aside from &quot;harvest these blocks so you can harvest better blocks&quot;
Lumenshroom: well minecraft what happens when i have the best blocks
Lumenshroom: boring
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: you make cool looking and creative stuff
Lumenshroom: why bother when you could do it in creative
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it&#39;s not about having the &quot;best blocks&quot; or whathaveyou, it&#39;s about making stuff that looks good using what you have
Lumenshroom: so
Lumenshroom: you&#39;re saying
Lumenshroom: that the objective, even in survival, is building things
Lumenshroom: even though it&#39;s called survival
Lumenshroom: you&#39;re admitting it&#39;s a confused game
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: uh
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: no
Lumenshroom: yeah
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: don&#39;t put words in my mouth pal
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: survival is survival, you do all that stuff while balancing enemy battles
Lumenshroom: &quot;it&#39;s about building cool things regardless of what you have&quot;
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: you even quoted me wrong :|
Lumenshroom: sounds like you&#39;re backpedaling tbh
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: i haven&#39;t backpedaled anywhere, i&#39;ve been saying the same thing since the beginning of the conversation
Lumenshroom: no you haven&#39;t lol
Lumenshroom: beginning of conversation = &quot;minecraft has lots of objectives! getting portal materials... and uh...&quot;,  end of conversation = &quot;minecraft&#39;s objective is to build things with what you have&quot;
Lumenshroom: that sounds a lot like backpedaling
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: once again, i never said the objective was to build cool things
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: i said that was what the game was about
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: even since creative that&#39;s what the game has been about
Lumenshroom: gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it&#39;s not about having the &quot;best blocks&quot; or whathaveyou, it&#39;s about making stuff that looks good using what you have
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: yes, i said that
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: ok
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: and i just said it again
Lumenshroom: the objective IS &quot;what the game is about&quot;
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: no it isn&#39;t, objectives are different than the game&#39;s purpose
Lumenshroom: unless you mean theme or something which is retarded because minecraft doesn&#39;t tell a story
Lumenshroom: at all
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: minecraft doesn&#39;t have a story, it&#39;s YOUR story, you make it with your experience
Lumenshroom: this is sounding more and more like a shitty RPG advert
Lumenshroom: something i&#39;d read in an ad for Aeion or whatever
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: you don&#39;t have to find dungeons or make portals or anything, you can cheat in all your materials if you want to, the game is fun because you can do whatever you want to
Lumenshroom: or second life
Lumenshroom: LOL
Lumenshroom: &quot;the game is fun because you do lots of stuff&quot;
Lumenshroom: that&#39;s not the criteria a game has to meet to make it &quot;good&quot;
Lumenshroom: fallout 3 let you do lots of stuff but it was also structured and allowed for linear play if the player wanted that
Lumenshroom: minecraft dumps you into a randomly generated pile of blocks and says &quot;do shit&quot;
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: oh my god did you really just try to compare fallout 3 to minecraft
Lumenshroom: yes
Lumenshroom: actually no lol
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: they are completely different games in concept, gameplay, and general plot and you just tried to compare them
Lumenshroom: you said that miencraft is good because it lets you do lots of different things, so i gave an example of a game which lets you do lots of things but is actually GOOD
Lumenshroom: also &quot;general plot lol
Lumenshroom: please explain to me minecraft&#39;s plot
Lumenshroom: leave no stone unturned and fill in all the plot holes!!
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: alright, here is the extent of minecraft&#39;s plot
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: give me a second, this is going to take a bit
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: &quot;you are a player who is dumped in a world that is as big as your hard drive space, and you have to get the materials necessary to make any kind of structure or shelter you want to while defending yourself from the hordes of monsters that spawn at night (this is of course optional as the game offers a difficulty setting that makes them all but vanish)&quot;
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: simple, easy
Lumenshroom: that&#39;s not a plot
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it was sarcasm
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: no shit it doesn&#39; t have a plot
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: the game has no directions or goals and that&#39;s the point of it
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: you can do literally whatever you want
Lumenshroom: you&#39;re
Lumenshroom: uh
Lumenshroom: forgetting why i brought that uop
Lumenshroom: you said fallout 3 and minecraft have &quot;way different general plots&quot;
Lumenshroom: pretty fucking dumb claim considering minecraft doesn&#39;t have one
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: it doesn&#39;t matter either way, they&#39;re still completely different games
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: that only helps my argument :|

Lumenshroom: i&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve been led so far down the rabbit hole we&#39;ve forgotten our points
gd&amp;#1103; | Doomish: i&#39;m still on my point, you&#39;ve gotten far off from yours
