                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=Sinr33t;27732185]Wow, so you people really find mining for hours, to find diamonds, to add to your collection of 300. Apparently now you feel it necessary to post it on Facepunch to show off your e-penis only to find someone that has more diamonds than you. Honestly, what makes Minecraft so fun to you?  Is it the constant building of buildings smoothing out the imperfections, then posting it on Facepunch so that one person may rate you artistic so you can squeal in glee at how much that one person loves your building enough to rate you the coveted artistic. I&#39;ve scanned through this thread and find that most of the posts regard setting up their server, showing off their generic houses, and asking other players what their texture pack is. It seems to me that it&#39;s not Minecraft its&#39; self, but the need to post your experience with Minecraft that everybody has already had multitudes of times just so that you can feel content with your poor decision of giving notch 10 dollars. What gets me, you all treat notch like he is a fucking god, well he&#39;s a pretty lazy god, maybe he should work for valve where he&#39;s more suited.[/QUOTE]
 
I find exploring gigantic mob filled caves extremely fun, yes. And just overall exploring, I like to see what the world generator can make
Some others just like the building aspect of it, like to make gigantic towns and castles.
Or others just like what you just said.
Just because we&#39;ve have a different opinion and look of &quot;fun&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re wrong.
Now go away, your shitty whining wont make us stop playing the game. Especially with that avatar."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Sinr33t;27732185]Wow, so you people really find mining for hours, to find diamonds, to add to your collection of 300. Apparently now you feel it necessary to post it on Facepunch to show off your e-penis only to find someone that has more diamonds than you. Honestly, what makes Minecraft so fun to you?  Is it the constant building of buildings smoothing out the imperfections, then posting it on Facepunch so that one person may rate you artistic so you can squeal in glee at how much that one person loves your building enough to rate you the coveted artistic. I&#39;ve scanned through this thread and find that most of the posts regard setting up their server, showing off their generic houses, and asking other players what their texture pack is. It seems to me that it&#39;s not Minecraft its&#39; self, but the need to post your experience with Minecraft that everybody has already had multitudes of times just so that you can feel content with your poor decision of giving notch 10 dollars. What gets me, you all treat notch like he is a fucking god, well he&#39;s a pretty lazy god, maybe he should work for valve where he&#39;s more suited.[/QUOTE]
 
I find exploring gigantic mob filled caves extremely fun, yes. And just overall exploring, I like to see what the world generator can make
Some others just like the building aspect of it, like to make gigantic towns and castles.
Or others just like what you just said.
Just because we&#39;ve have a different opinion and look of &quot;fun&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re wrong.
Now go away, your shitty whining wont make us stop playing the game. Especially with that avatar.</span>

I think you should build engravings on the walls instead, it might look nicer than a big statue taking up a bunch of space.

Apparently now you feel it necessary to post it on Facepunch to show off your e-penis only to find someone that has more diamonds than you. Honestly, what makes Minecraft so fun to you?  Is it the constant building of buildings smoothing out the imperfections, then posting it on Facepunch so that one person may rate you artistic so you can squeal in glee at how much that one person loves your building enough to rate you the coveted artistic. I&#39;ve scanned through this thread and find that most of the posts regard setting up their server, showing off their generic houses, and asking other players what their texture pack is. It seems to me that it&#39;s not Minecraft its&#39; self, but the need to post your experience with Minecraft that everybody has already had multitudes of times just so that you can feel content with your poor decision of giving notch 10 dollars. What gets me, you all treat notch like he is a fucking god, well he&#39;s a pretty lazy god, maybe he should work for valve where he&#39;s more suited.[/QUOTE]
 
If you&#39;re so adamant about how bad and boring the game is, then leave.

It&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just that I&#39;m trying to understand why this game is so fun and why it has such a large following.[/QUOTE]

Well, I personally just primarily do cave exploring. I installed a lot of mods that add more things to be mined (shockah&#39;s mineral mods), in combination with R-T-B&#39;s updated version of the Biome Terrain Mod, which I set to make the world far more chaotic, and make caves more likely.

I&#39;m going to currently change distributions so coal is a lot rarer. The idea is forcing myself to have to use non-coal fuels, such as burning wood, and making coal itself much more valuable (as it should be). I mean, I currently have four full stacks of coal just sitting in my chest, waiting to be used. It&#39;s kind of ridiculous, actually."

It&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just that I&#39;m trying to understand why this game is so fun and why it has such a large following.[/QUOTE]

Well, I personally just primarily do cave exploring. I installed a lot of mods that add more things to be mined (shockah&#39;s mineral mods), in combination with R-T-B&#39;s updated version of the Biome Terrain Mod, which I set to make the world far more chaotic, and make caves more likely.

I&#39;m going to currently change distributions so coal is a lot rarer. The idea is forcing myself to have to use non-coal fuels, such as burning wood, and making coal itself much more valuable (as it should be). I mean, I currently have four full stacks of coal just sitting in my chest, waiting to be used. It&#39;s kind of ridiculous, actually.</span>

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=Loofiloo;27731504]Is there some way I can increase the brightness of Minecraft?

I&#39;ve been playing with my friend, and he goes wandering around in caves without even placing any torches anywhere. My monitor must be darker (or maybe it&#39;s due to a slight glare behind me) because I can&#39;t go more than 7-8 steps away from a torch before everything is [i]pitch black[/i]. If I&#39;m caught outside in the middle of the night, I can&#39;t see a damn thing if there are no torches. I can hardly even see my sword in my hand.

My monitor&#39;s brightness is already turned up to its maximum, so is there any more I can do? Like maybe edit some Minecraft properties file that allows for adjusting brightness? Because it certainly isn&#39;t in the options menu.[/QUOTE]
