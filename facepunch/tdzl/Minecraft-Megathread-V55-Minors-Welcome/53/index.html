And don&#39;t say MCEdit or some other map editor cuz they don&#39;t work!!!
I make a small map and if I get to the edge of the map and climb up it&#39;s just the normal map again :(

This isn&#39;t about having a small map for fun(well yes for fun but...) but because I don&#39;t have a good enough connection for invdev but I do for classic.

how can I use classic map in beta?

Thanks for any help."

The first time I played Minecraft was about 10 days after the official first release. I tried it once or twice and then forgot about it completely for a long time. Bought it in August 2010.

For me, it is just over two years at this point. Minecraft is basically what got me into Facepunch. Hell, I&#39;ll give you guys a quick history because I&#39;m feeling old.

Lets go back to October of 2009, and I was listening to the Casual Collective web radio. Someone said it was boring and they would go back to playing this strange game called &quot;minecraft&quot;. I did the same and after finding the site, was amazed and made lots of awesome stuff. I found multiplayer, and was fully addicted at this point, and an active member of the tiny forum, minecraftforum.net. Back then the community was small and fun.

I didn&#39;t actually buy the game yet, but there was this gifting program going on at this time which was if you bought the game, you could give a free copy to anyone you wanted. This went from about December 25th to 2010. I was searching some multiplayer servers at this time and stumbed across &quot;Heavy Petters&quot;, I&#39;m just messing around there, and some guy called &quot;Doomish&quot; was talking about making a Black Mesa replica in minecraft. I&#39;m interested, and join in the fun. We used Freeman&#39;s Mind as a guide, and made a ton of it. It eventually got griefed by &quot;sprite_hater&quot;, and we were pretty sad. I eventually found out that this server was made for &quot;Facepunch&quot; members, and I checked out the forum and casually joined to comment on the Black Mesa project. I eventually got hooked, and look where I am now.

The server owner, Shaedez, on new year&#39;s eve, decided to gift me the game. Just about this time, indev came out. That was a ton of fun, so I played that and multiplayer creative mode on and off. I eventually started Minelife, a popular blog about indev mode that was on Notch&#39;s blog at one point, as well as Minecast, a popular minecraft podcast that featured Notch on the 5th episode. ([url]http://minecast.zuriki.net/[/url]) Some point in this time, the game exploded and the forums were overrun. I migrated most of my posting over to here, and the rest is history."

For me, it is just over two years at this point. Minecraft is basically what got me into Facepunch. Hell, I&#39;ll give you guys a quick history because I&#39;m feeling old.

I&#39;m a very creative person, or at least a person that likes to attempt to be creative, and this game certainly encourages it. I think a combination of SMP and constant updates keeps the game quite fresh and enjoyable for long periods of time.

Also, people like Doomish have been playing longer than me, and are still very active on the forums.
