It&#39;s not going to happen overnight, but I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll be able to do this. I got quite far with my RP mod for GMOD and that was really limiting and difficult for the coders. Probably would&#39;ve been made into a releasable state too, if I didn&#39;t end up demodding and banning the head coder for abusing his moderator powers :v:

[QUOTE=Saza;27622766]Hmm. Some things right off the bat might take time.

But others would be simple. I can see the gold as currency as it isn&#39;t good for much else but the problem is it&#39;s rare as hell. 

The custom tools are like a texture pack - doable, as they&#39;re pretty much a 3d rendering of the icon.
Same for the texpack. 

I&#39;m not sure about the nations models and the balancer.

Maybe modifying Factions / Groups for the teams, but I don&#39;t think it can force a custom skin.

I can help with the RP or Gestapo and I know a few others who can as well.

As far as hosting goes I don&#39;&#39;t know of any hosters that offer that for a reasonable price.[/QUOTE]
 
With regards to the gold as currency, we could maybe bump up the spawn rate in that map generator thing someone mentioned earlier. We&#39;ll have to see though, it&#39;s not important at the moment. I&#39;m open to suggestions!

As for the RP for each faction, I really want them to be distinct and each have their underlying theme that reflects in their building style. For example, we could have a green kingdom that build their houses into the ground so as to maximise the amount of farming land available. We could have a red kingdom that is all about aggression and building big penis shaped buildings. We could have a blue kingdom that builds things on the water and sometimes even underneath, who live off of fish! And so on, so forth. That&#39;s the kind of thing I&#39;m looking for!

[QUOTE=nerdygamer;27622787]Most of that stuff is possible but what you are asking is a lot.[/QUOTE]

Yeah, something like that. Except they probably wouldn&#39;t look like their original blocks and might act differently, like sand won&#39;t fall anymore and will act more like dirt.

[QUOTE=boxxy brown;27622838]Hezzy, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen Betterlight or not but it&#39;s a must have. Right now it&#39;s quite bugged (sides of grass are puke green) but the maker is about to push out a fix.


[img_thumb]http://i.min.us/iCmkM.png[/img_thumb][/QUOTE]
 
Yes, I&#39;m running Betterlight with qPack

[QUOTE=Esteam;27622840]You&#39;re restricting cities built in with two different blocks.

That won&#39;t work out, ever.

I would rather have building styles that of Europe, different countries for different cities.[/QUOTE]
 
I&#39;m not a great believer in restrictions - people wouldn&#39;t be forbidden from using different blocks, it&#39;s just that those blocks will be the most common in that area.

[QUOTE=Inacio;27622841]Sure would be awesome, but you&#39;d have to find commited players - I once ran an experiment server to see if I could get a group of people excited about being a team, and it was anything but easy.
And dude, seriously: get to meet BiomeMod. That&#39;d make this whole thing much more plausible. With BiomeMod you can set the rarity of blocks, so all you&#39;d have to do is set a config, generate a kingdom, change that config, generate the other kingdoms, and [I]if[/I] you don&#39;t want people to generate more land, you just set a boundary.

Hot damn this sounds nice[/QUOTE]
 
Brilliant, so we&#39;ve already got that shit sorted out - we can tick it off the list.

Yes, exactly. They wouldn&#39;t really be able to enjoy it properly if they weren&#39;t using the correct model and texture pack.

[QUOTE=Saza;27622887]You can&#39;t FORCE a player to have one, it&#39;s their own choice when they upload their skin to MCnet. You could ask them nicely, though :v:
Mine&#39;s a creeper in a suit but right now I can&#39;t have it uploaded as it&#39;s being migrated.[/QUOTE]
 
That&#39;s fine, maybe people could even make their own custom skins! The only thing is that you&#39;d have to distinguish it as a member of a kingdom, so if they were red kingdom they&#39;d have to use a lot of red.

[QUOTE=kevinseven;27622906]Whats this thing Hezzy is posting about? It sounds cool, I&#39;d love to help build cities and be a guard/police for it.[/QUOTE]
 
Go to my profile and search for my last posts, you can catch up about it on there

[QUOTE=FlubberNugget;27622999]Exactly what are the teams, current server groups?[/QUOTE]
 
I&#39;d probably be assigning people randomly to each faction, to encourage people to make friends and work together. I think it&#39;d be more fun that way. If we keep everyone in their little groups then sometimes they tend to get a bit cliquey 

[QUOTE=krail9;27623047]Instead of forcing skins there should be a mod that gives faction-specific capes :buddy:[/QUOTE]
 
See, these are the kind of ideas I&#39;m on about - I didn&#39;t even know there were capes in the game!

[QUOTE=Esteam;27623063]Most of the people saying they&#39;re :awesome: builders, are really shitty and just trying to get into a role.[/QUOTE]
 
When it comes down to getting someone to help me come up with motifs and building styles I&#39;ll probably just have people email pictures of their creations. This will probably follow the creation of a custom texture pack.

[QUOTE=Shadowstone;27623217]Hezzy, if you&#39;re serious about doing that you may want to actually consider getting some professional mod makers, or try to get in contact with Notch himself or another Mojang employee.
