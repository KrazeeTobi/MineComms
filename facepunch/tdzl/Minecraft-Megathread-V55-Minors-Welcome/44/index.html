Planetside would make this 200% more awesome. 

It also works with architecture, vanu (the best :v:) having sleek, purple alien buildings, terran having very industrial/minimalist buildings. 

Also with mods maybe the equipment of each faction could be different, vanu are the only ones who can wear diamond armour, terran have more powerful bows, and NC have the best swords :v:"

As do I, only things that are supposed to be made out of cloth should be made out of cloth.

I came up with an idea - why not have a giant server with areas that are split into countries. Each country would make a town and they&#39;d interact with each other. There&#39;d be a king for each country, who are part of the game staff and their job is to organise events such as going to war or banding together to kill a group of monsters or something. They&#39;d also give direction on how to build buildings, so each country would have their own building style (and colours). I think it&#39;d be cool to see all this play out, and the dynamics between them. It could be mirrored here on the forums, with a private forum for members of each nation and a general forum for all the nations to interact in.

Failing that (due to hardware / software limitations), we could have a server dedicated to each country and then a &quot;wilderness&quot; server which would be open to members of all the countries.[/QUOTE]
