Look near sandy beaches and in deserts. I went schlepping through a desert one time and found 400+ clay there. :byodood:
So basically, where there&#39;s sand, odds are there might be clay.</span>

okay, i think the cobblestone looks like someone put plastic wrap over it, it seems too shiny. same goes for the hellstone, but i guess you could pass that off as trying to look like meat, i guess. the thing above the chest, i honestly cant tell, it seems just.. bad. i cant describe it, sorry. the leaves just look like a clusterfuck, the wool just looks like a plain colour to me, with a tiny TINY bit of noise, and the top of the grass looks like green-ish wool. alot of it is nice, but there are some obvious flaws (imo)[/QUOTE]

Thank you for the clarification. 

Not that I&#39;m rejecting your criticism here, but I disagree with the thing about the cobble and blood stone. Keep in mind however, there are several cobble/mossy cobble alternatives in the Alternatives.png. If there is enough people saying that it looks as you described &quot;like someone put plastic wrap over it&quot;, I can look into modifying it.

The thing above the chest is the jukebox, I do want to make another however this was a kind of &quot;last minute&quot; one, because the one we had originally didn&#39;t work too well with the new music blocks. You can&#39;t see it from the angle but there is a record on top, giving a clear indication that it is in fact a record player. 

Leaves I agree entirely with, and really that&#39;s all they are, a clusterfuck. I do want to make another one (see To Do list), however, I prioritised other things over leaves because I felt that they were at a tolerable level for the moment. 

The wool does have noise, just very subtle like you said. I can increase it but I found when in game, it was more noticeable up close. I may make the wool noisier in time, but for now that&#39;ll do.

The grass I do somewhat agree with. I don&#39;t think it looks like green wool, but quite obviously it is a very simple texture. Believe me, I have tried to make it more interesting but I struggled with that. We&#39;ll try and see what can be done with it, but no promises.

Anyway, again thankyou for clarifying."

Noticed it was Flaks, I don&#39;t really mind it though.
