The idea behind this game mode is that people want to work together to build a kingdom and take part in events. If they won&#39;t listen to the king, then what&#39;s the point being on the server?

[QUOTE=The Inzuki;27624550]Hey, Hezzy, I&#39;m not trying to be a bother (not sure if you&#39;re ignoring me :v:) but do you need any help with this whole plan you&#39;re devising?

As in, can I be of any assistance?[/QUOTE]
 
I&#39;ll post the list of stuff I need doing;

List of shit that I&#39;ll need, not sure if it&#39;s all possible but please let me know if it isn&#39;t:

[list][*]Something that&#39;ll provide three teams, force same model for each team. 
[*]Team balancer, so teams can&#39;t go over 20 people (for a 60 person server)
[*]Custom models for tools / weapons / armour
[*]Distinct models for each three nations
[*]Texture pack that incorporates national colours
[*]Something that will allow me to edit tool, armour and weapon values. I.E making stone as good as iron.
[*][sp]Something that will allow me to edit the percentage of certain blocks in a certain region (so we can allocate custom textured blocks into the area - more red blocks than blue blocks in red kingdom, etc)[/sp]
[*][sp]Currency system (Gold ingots maybe?)[/sp]
[*]Some background regarding the three kingdoms
[*]Person(s) to design motifs and themes for each kingdom
[*]Two people to help me run RP events (Kings)
[*]Nine people to help keep the peace (City Watch / Police / GESTAPO)
[*]Someone to help with the technical side of things
[*][sp]Reliable hosting company[/sp][/list]

That&#39;s all I can think of, anything else?

[QUOTE=nerdygamer;27624776]I&#39;m not saying we should build out of cloth but at least have Roofs or something on our buildings that have our kingdom color.[/QUOTE]
 
I think you&#39;re forgetting that some blocks are going to have their textures changed, so that they make each kingdom&#39;s land look unique, as well as having their buildings look unique too. I&#39;m not quite sure how I&#39;m going to do this yet as I&#39;m not familiar with the restrictions of block modification. If someone can point me in the right direction, that&#39;d be cool. At the moment I&#39;m thinking of making dirt the common block for Kingdom C, clay the common block for kingdom B and obsidian the common block for kingdom A. This most likely isn&#39;t going to be the best solution, but it&#39;s a start for now. The attributes would be modified to make them fair, so obsidian and clay will be able to be mined as easy as dirt, etc.

[QUOTE=helpiminabox;27624817]If you do use blue colored cloth as a kingdom&#39;s color, you better jack up the lapuz whatever it&#39;s called by a lot.[/QUOTE]
 
If we go down that way then I&#39;ll definitely be doing this. However, I&#39;d prefer not to encourage people to use cloth as a building material, it isn&#39;t right!"

I&#39;ll post the list of stuff I need doing;

List of shit that I&#39;ll need, not sure if it&#39;s all possible but please let me know if it isn&#39;t:

[list][*]Something that&#39;ll provide three teams, force same model for each team. 
[*]Team balancer, so teams can&#39;t go over 20 people (for a 60 person server)
[*]Custom models for tools / weapons / armour
[*]Distinct models for each three nations
[*]Texture pack that incorporates national colours
[*]Something that will allow me to edit tool, armour and weapon values. I.E making stone as good as iron.
[*][sp]Something that will allow me to edit the percentage of certain blocks in a certain region (so we can allocate custom textured blocks into the area - more red blocks than blue blocks in red kingdom, etc)[/sp]
[*][sp]Currency system (Gold ingots maybe?)[/sp]
[*]Some background regarding the three kingdoms
[*]Person(s) to design motifs and themes for each kingdom
[*]Two people to help me run RP events (Kings)
[*]Nine people to help keep the peace (City Watch / Police / GESTAPO)
[*]Someone to help with the technical side of things
[*][sp]Reliable hosting company[/sp][/list]

That&#39;s all I can think of, anything else?

[QUOTE=nerdygamer;27624776]I&#39;m not saying we should build out of cloth but at least have Roofs or something on our buildings that have our kingdom color.[/QUOTE]
 
I think you&#39;re forgetting that some blocks are going to have their textures changed, so that they make each kingdom&#39;s land look unique, as well as having their buildings look unique too. I&#39;m not quite sure how I&#39;m going to do this yet as I&#39;m not familiar with the restrictions of block modification. If someone can point me in the right direction, that&#39;d be cool. At the moment I&#39;m thinking of making dirt the common block for Kingdom C, clay the common block for kingdom B and obsidian the common block for kingdom A. This most likely isn&#39;t going to be the best solution, but it&#39;s a start for now. The attributes would be modified to make them fair, so obsidian and clay will be able to be mined as easy as dirt, etc.

[QUOTE=helpiminabox;27624817]If you do use blue colored cloth as a kingdom&#39;s color, you better jack up the lapuz whatever it&#39;s called by a lot.[/QUOTE]
 
If we go down that way then I&#39;ll definitely be doing this. However, I&#39;d prefer not to encourage people to use cloth as a building material, it isn&#39;t right!</span>

I&#39;ll post the list of stuff I need doing;

List of shit that I&#39;ll need, not sure if it&#39;s all possible but please let me know if it isn&#39;t:

[list][*]Something that&#39;ll provide three teams, force same model for each team. 
[*]Team balancer, so teams can&#39;t go over 20 people (for a 60 person server)
[*]Custom models for tools / weapons / armour
[*]Distinct models for each three nations
[*]Texture pack that incorporates national colours
[*]Something that will allow me to edit tool, armour and weapon values. I.E making stone as good as iron.
[*][sp]Something that will allow me to edit the percentage of certain blocks in a certain region (so we can allocate custom textured blocks into the area - more red blocks than blue blocks in red kingdom, etc)[/sp]
[*][sp]Currency system (Gold ingots maybe?)[/sp]
[*]Some background regarding the three kingdoms
[*]Person(s) to design motifs and themes for each kingdom
[*]Two people to help me run RP events (Kings)
[*]Nine people to help keep the peace (City Watch / Police / GESTAPO)
[*]Someone to help with the technical side of things
[*][sp]Reliable hosting company[/sp][/list]

That&#39;s all I can think of, anything else?


 
I think you&#39;re forgetting that some blocks are going to have their textures changed, so that they make each kingdom&#39;s land look unique, as well as having their buildings look unique too. I&#39;m not quite sure how I&#39;m going to do this yet as I&#39;m not familiar with the restrictions of block modification. If someone can point me in the right direction, that&#39;d be cool. At the moment I&#39;m thinking of making dirt the common block for Kingdom C, clay the common block for kingdom B and obsidian the common block for kingdom A. This most likely isn&#39;t going to be the best solution, but it&#39;s a start for now. The attributes would be modified to make them fair, so obsidian and clay will be able to be mined as easy as dirt, etc.

If we go down that way then I&#39;ll definitely be doing this. However, I&#39;d prefer not to encourage people to use cloth as a building material, it isn&#39;t right![/QUOTE]
 
Since you want to do this all on the same map then that might be hard. Hell I don&#39;t even think it is possible. Making parts of the map have more resources then another is not something that can be done Biome mod. Its more like you change some values and things appear more then others. You can&#39;t really say &quot;Lets spawn this stuff here and this stuff there.&quot; Also the values and stuff. That is possible to change (I think).

[list][*]Something that&#39;ll provide three teams, force same model for each team. 
[*]Team balancer, so teams can&#39;t go over 20 people (for a 60 person server) - [b] With coding this can be done easily[/b]
[*]Custom models for tools / weapons / armour [b] This is done with texture packs but you can&#39;t make everyone have a unique armor. But then again you could make all armor the same damage reduction and durability and just have different textures for leather, iron, gold, and diamond.[/b]
[*]Distinct models for each three nations - [b] What do you mean by model?[/b]
[*]Texture pack that incorporates national colours - [b] Possible [/b]
[*]Something that will allow me to edit tool, armour and weapon values. I.E making stone as good as iron. [b] With a plugin you can do that. There is not one out now but I am sure it would not be hard to make[/b]
[*][sp]Something that will allow me to edit the percentage of certain blocks in a certain region (so we can allocate custom textured blocks into the area - more red blocks than blue blocks in red kingdom, etc)[/sp] -[b] Not possible in the same map. But with different maps it might be. [/b]
[*][sp]Currency system (Gold ingots maybe?)[/sp] - [b] Already a plugin for this.[/b]
[*]Some background regarding the three kingdoms
[*]Person(s) to design motifs and themes for each kingdom
[*]Two people to help me run RP events (Kings)
[*]Nine people to help keep the peace (City Watch / Police / GESTAPO)
[*]Someone to help with the technical side of things - [b] Many of us host servers so I am sure Profan or Flak would not mind helping.[/b]
[*][sp]Reliable hosting company[/sp][/list] - [b] For dedicated servers I would say limestone since I had a good time with them when I was with crafthub.[/b]

Also what do you mean &quot;Something that&#39;ll provide three teams, force same model for each team. &quot;

If we can change the attributes of blocks can&#39;t we simply make new blocks all together? Anyway that is a good idea, although maybe dirt should be something else? Clay and obsidian are good though.

It&#39;d have to be done manually but that isn&#39;t really a big deal. We&#39;d also be working with a limited amount of space. It wouldn&#39;t be small by any stretch of the imagination but it&#39;ll still be limited.

If need be, then I&#39;ll split the different nations into different servers. Don&#39;t really want to have to do that, but if it&#39;s necessary then that&#39;s that!

Can someone take a look at this [url]http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/more-blocks-in-multiplayer.1733/[/url] and help me understand how possible this is?

With regards to the &quot;force same model&quot; quote, we&#39;ve established that player models can&#39;t be forced. This won&#39;t be a problem for when the server is small but if it gets larger we&#39;ll have to come up with something! Can&#39;t have people from the blue kingdom running around wearing red kingdom&#39;s clothes!

Talking about the armour, I meant pretty much exactly what you said. We&#39;d have iron assigned to Red Kingdom, Gold assigned to Blue Kingdom and Diamond assigned to Green Kingdom. To make it fair, the ores must be made equal and the armour must be made with the same damage reduction and durability. Each armour will be coloured to correspond with the nation&#39;s primary colour.

To begin with I&#39;m looking at a 15 slot server to test on, moving onto a 30 slot server for the initial release."
