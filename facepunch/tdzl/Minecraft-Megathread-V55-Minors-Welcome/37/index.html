I came up with an idea - why not have a giant server with areas that are split into countries. Each country would make a town and they&#39;d interact with each other. There&#39;d be a king for each country, who are part of the game staff and their job is to organise events such as going to war or banding together to kill a group of monsters or something. They&#39;d also give direction on how to build buildings, so each country would have their own building style (and colours). I think it&#39;d be cool to see all this play out, and the dynamics between them. It could be mirrored here on the forums, with a private forum for members of each nation and a general forum for all the nations to interact in.

Failing that (due to hardware / software limitations), we could have a server dedicated to each country and then a &quot;wilderness&quot; server which would be open to members of all the countries.[/QUOTE]

But with todays plugins you can really stop all that pretty quickly. Like BigBrother. I can find out who build and destroyed any block in my server with a couple of commands. Even down to a 1 block radius.  I can know when and where someone is placing lava and or water at any time.[/QUOTE]
 
I thought BigBrother only recorded such actions when you told it to watch someone, so does it just keep a log of all changes now like LogBlock used to?"

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=nerdygamer;27622270]As in keep track of. Make sure no one is griefing and doing something they are not suppose to.

But with todays plugins you can really stop all that pretty quickly. Like BigBrother. I can find out who build and destroyed any block in my server with a couple of commands. Even down to a 1 block radius.  I can know when and where someone is placing lava and or water at any time.[/QUOTE]
 
I thought BigBrother only recorded such actions when you told it to watch someone, so does it just keep a log of all changes now like LogBlock used to?</span>

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Hezzy;27622437]At the moment I&#39;m thinking maybe three different nations, each with their own prime colour and building style. I&#39;d of course have to get someone a bit more artistic and knowledgeable in Minecraft to help me with that but I&#39;m thinking it can be done without much fuss. If it&#39;s possible, it might be worth limiting certain resources within certain regions of the map so different buildings are made out of different kinds of block. We can also use texture packs to do this.[/QUOTE]
 
Personally if I founded a city it&#39;d be Dwarf-like, where everything&#39;s underground and carved from hills and mountains.

[QUOTE=nerdygamer;27622504]Its exactly like log block now. Except you  have a config that you can specify what you want it to watch. Like  blocks placed, buttons pressed, chest, and even doors.[/QUOTE]
 
o rly? I must experiment at once. I read before Bukkit became THE server mod that it only logged people you told it to because the way it did shit was slow and resource intensive.</span>

Hmm. Some things right off the bat might take time.

But others would be simple. I can see the gold as currency as it isn&#39;t good for much else but the problem is it&#39;s rare as hell. 

The custom tools are like a texture pack - doable, as they&#39;re pretty much a 3d rendering of the icon.
Same for the texpack. 

I&#39;m not sure about the nations models and the balancer.

Maybe modifying Factions / Groups for the teams, but I don&#39;t think it can force a custom skin.

I can help with the RP or Gestapo and I know a few others who can as well.

As far as hosting goes I don&#39;&#39;t know of any hosters that offer that for a reasonable price."
