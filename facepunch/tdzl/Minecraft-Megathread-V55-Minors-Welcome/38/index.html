With regards to building styles, I&#39;m thinking it&#39;d be on a couple of levels - you&#39;d build out of a specific material that&#39;d be common to the area (so blue blocks occur a lot in the blue kingdom), there&#39;d be little architectural nuances - like you&#39;ve got to build a roof in this particular way or something like that.

[list][*]Something that&#39;ll provide three teams, force same model for each team. [b]Not possible yet[/b]
[*]Team balancer, so teams can&#39;t go over 20 people (for a 60 person server)
[*]Custom models for tools / weapons / armour 
[*]Distinct models for each three nations 
[*]Texture pack that incorporates national colours[b]You can&#39;t make people use a texture pack yet.[/b]
[*]Something that will allow me to edit tool, armour and weapon values. I.E making stone as good as iron.
[*]Something that will allow me to edit the percentage of certain blocks in a certain region (so we can allocate custom textured blocks into the area - more red blocks than blue blocks in red kingdom, etc)[b]This is not possible.

With regards to the force model, I&#39;ve seen people having custom models in servers. Maybe that would be a sufficient compromise?

I was planning on asking someone to make a custom texture pack, so people could perhaps mine some blue block and make a blue block house. Can you get it so that when the world is seeded, the blocks look a certain way, and when the player mines then and puts then down again, they look different? I&#39;m sure it does this for stone. We could have it so perhaps one region looks quite deserty or something and when you place the mined blocks, they&#39;re red brickwork or somethign like that."
