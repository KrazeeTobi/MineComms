Well, the only ones that I KNOW are furries are the ones that are up in your face about it. I&#39;m sure there are some that aren&#39;t like that but you don&#39;t really know because they are nice enough to leave me alone about it. I don&#39;t go around saying that I love guns and shooting shit all the time unless the person I&#39;m talking to feel the same way.

[QUOTE=Doomish;27601245]The title of this thread is &quot;Minors Welcome! (Except Mario583)&quot;. The title of this thread is hating on a single person and it&#39;s going to be around for 119 more pages. What do you think that says about us? Do you or chezhead or anyone think that it makes us look good? People who look at the title of this thread are going to think &quot;Gee, I wonder why they hate this person? Maybe they&#39;ll hate me if I post there, Minecraft must have a shitty community&quot; and that is not acceptable. It&#39;s rude. They don&#39;t know Mario583 was a &quot;furry&quot; or a &quot;shitposter&quot;, they just think he&#39;s another member of the forum.[/QUOTE]

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Stupideye;27601244]Thats not always true. You are just stereotyping furry&#39;s. I know someone on here that is a furry and he&#39;s actually a really cool guy.[/QUOTE]
 
Well, the only ones that I KNOW are furries are the ones that are up in your face about it. I&#39;m sure there are some that aren&#39;t like that but you don&#39;t really know because they are nice enough to leave me alone about it. I don&#39;t go around saying that I love guns and shooting shit all the time unless the person I&#39;m talking to feel the same way.

[QUOTE=Doomish;27601245]The title of this thread is &quot;Minors Welcome! (Except Mario583)&quot;. The title of this thread is hating on a single person and it&#39;s going to be around for 119 more pages. What do you think that says about us? Do you or chezhead or anyone think that it makes us look good? People who look at the title of this thread are going to think &quot;Gee, I wonder why they hate this person? Maybe they&#39;ll hate me if I post there, Minecraft must have a shitty community&quot; and that is not acceptable. It&#39;s rude. They don&#39;t know Mario583 was a &quot;furry&quot; or a &quot;shitposter&quot;, they just think he&#39;s another member of the forum.[/QUOTE]
 That&#39;s a good point. It&#39;s shitty that they didn&#39;t just leave it be.</span>

I&#39;m glad we can at least agree on something.

What&#39;s been going on in this thread of late is just ridiculous. At least Mario posted content unlike half the posters here. I&#39;ve noticed that a lot of people only seem to post in agreement with those that just outright say &quot;____ is a bad poster&quot;. It&#39;s annoying, wastes thread space, nobody cares, and is bannable, so just stop doing it, I promise that it&#39;s in your best interest. You know who you are.

I have to use Nerdy as an example (sorry). I hated him before, but then I thought about why I hated him and I couldn&#39;t come up with a real reason. I can say the same thing about a lot of the people this thread is seemingly against. It&#39;s just stupid."

[b][url=http://www.mediafire.com/?0k77j8zfvd5a0xa]Download the latest version on the Medieval Craft [32x32] Texture Pack, 1.0.1b![/url][/b]
Note: The terrain.png is completely useable, the b is to indicate we&#39;re not done with the pack yet! Read below under &quot;To Do&quot; to see why.

[b]About[/b]
A texture pack loosely based on a Medieval style setting. Initially was called the &quot;Ancient Greek pack&quot; or &quot;Hellenic pack&quot; however after continuously straying away from that theme in order to keep it interesting, we decided it was no longer an &#39;Ancient Greek&#39; pack. This pack was designed for Multiplayer use, however it will work fine in Singleplayer.

[b]Installation[/b]
[i]If you want to use any of the Alternative textures, read under the &quot;Alternative Textures&quot; sub heading![/i]
1. Download the .zip file above
2. If you don&#39;t want animated water + lava and you don&#39;t mind some blocks not displaying correctly, skip this step. If you want to use the texture pack as best as possible, download [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1021&amp;t=46173]xau&#39;s HD Texture Fix[/url], if you have trouble using it request help in that thrad, not this one. 
3. Paste the .zip file (do not extract it!) in your Minecraft texturepacks directory, you can either navigate to it manually or access it via the ingame menu.
4. Select the texture pack in the &quot;Mods and Texture Packs&quot; window
5. Enjoy!

[b]Alternative Textures[/b]
If you wish to use a texture other than the one in the original terrain.png, follow the following instructions. The block which is probably furthest from the original is the lightstone, which has been changed to be more practical in building situations. There are however 2 alternative versions that have a more natural look. 
1. Extract Medieval Craft.zip 
2. Open both the Alternatives.png and Terrain.png in your image editor of choice
3. On the Alternatives.png, highlight via a select tool the texture you would like to replace (it has to be the exact 32x32 pixels!) and copy it (shortcut Crtl + c)
4. Open the window with the terrain.png file, and paste the your recently copied texure/s down and place it over the texture you&#39;re wanting to replace.
5. For textures which have a transparent background, it will probably require erasing the original image behind it. Either use the eraser tool, or select the area and press &#39;Del&#39;/&#39;Delete&#39; on your keyboard.

If you are unable to do the above, post in the thread nicely asking and specifying your requests, and someone may be nice enough to do it for you. Please don&#39;t ask just to be lazy!


[b]To Do[/b]
As this is not a final release, we do have some things we wish to do in the future. We make no promises however, what determines whether we do these is based purely on motivation and interest in the pack. Anywho, to the point:
- Finish items.png (I&#39;ve started the tools, that&#39;s about it. If anyone would like to do this (keeping in mind I prefer to keep a certain quality standard) then feel free to do so, though I won&#39;t be expecting anyone to :P
- Make a new GUI and Menu theme
- Change the portraits or at the very least increase them from a 16x16 scale to 32x32 scale
- Boats
- Change the Sun and Moon
- New particles file
- Fix lava (it doesn&#39;t tile flawlessly)
- Make a better custom cake, rather than a 32x32 version of the original (not a priority, I don&#39;t totally agree with the addition of the cake for anything more than a bit of fun).
- Maybe mobs, I&#39;m not too sure about this as it may take away from the minecraft feel..
- I want to make new leaves, but I&#39;m struggling to do this without making them look like total shit. If anyone was able to do them for me (to a sufficient standard mind you) I would happily add them officially, providing they weren&#39;t ripped without permission off of another pack. Until then, I will continue trying myself.
- I kind of want to make a new simpler dirt, but I don&#39;t like making things as basic as a blank 32x32 square with some noise, so I&#39;ll see what I can do. 
- Probably more that I can&#39;t think of right now

[b]What you can do to improve this pack![/b]
Provide feedback, make suggestions for future updates and report issues such as bad tiling. 

[b]Video[/b]
Coming soon, hopefully. Feel free to make your own if you want and I&#39;ll probably add it to this post.

[b][url=http://www.mediafire.com/?0k77j8zfvd5a0xa]Download the latest version on the Medieval Craft [32x32] Texture Pack, 1.0.1b![/url][/b]
Note: The terrain.png is completely useable, the b is to indicate we&#39;re not done with the pack yet! Read below under &quot;To Do&quot; to see why.

[b]About[/b]
A texture pack loosely based on a Medieval style setting. Initially was called the &quot;Ancient Greek pack&quot; or &quot;Hellenic pack&quot; however after continuously straying away from that theme in order to keep it interesting, we decided it was no longer an &#39;Ancient Greek&#39; pack. This pack was designed for Multiplayer use, however it will work fine in Singleplayer.

[b]Installation[/b]
[i]If you want to use any of the Alternative textures, read under the &quot;Alternative Textures&quot; sub heading![/i]
1. Download the .zip file above
2. If you don&#39;t want animated water + lava and you don&#39;t mind some blocks not displaying correctly, skip this step. If you want to use the texture pack as best as possible, download [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1021&amp;t=46173]xau&#39;s HD Texture Fix[/url], if you have trouble using it request help in that thrad, not this one. 
3. Paste the .zip file (do not extract it!) in your Minecraft texturepacks directory, you can either navigate to it manually or access it via the ingame menu.
4. Select the texture pack in the &quot;Mods and Texture Packs&quot; window
5. Enjoy!

[b]Alternative Textures[/b]
If you wish to use a texture other than the one in the original terrain.png, follow the following instructions. The block which is probably furthest from the original is the lightstone, which has been changed to be more practical in building situations. There are however 2 alternative versions that have a more natural look. 
1. Extract Medieval Craft.zip 
2. Open both the Alternatives.png and Terrain.png in your image editor of choice
3. On the Alternatives.png, highlight via a select tool the texture you would like to replace (it has to be the exact 32x32 pixels!) and copy it (shortcut Crtl + c)
4. Open the window with the terrain.png file, and paste the your recently copied texure/s down and place it over the texture you&#39;re wanting to replace.
5. For textures which have a transparent background, it will probably require erasing the original image behind it. Either use the eraser tool, or select the area and press &#39;Del&#39;/&#39;Delete&#39; on your keyboard.

If you are unable to do the above, post in the thread nicely asking and specifying your requests, and someone may be nice enough to do it for you. Please don&#39;t ask just to be lazy!


[b]To Do[/b]
As this is not a final release, we do have some things we wish to do in the future. We make no promises however, what determines whether we do these is based purely on motivation and interest in the pack. Anywho, to the point:
- Finish items.png (I&#39;ve started the tools, that&#39;s about it. If anyone would like to do this (keeping in mind I prefer to keep a certain quality standard) then feel free to do so, though I won&#39;t be expecting anyone to :P
- Make a new GUI and Menu theme
- Change the portraits or at the very least increase them from a 16x16 scale to 32x32 scale
- Boats
- Change the Sun and Moon
- New particles file
- Fix lava (it doesn&#39;t tile flawlessly)
- Make a better custom cake, rather than a 32x32 version of the original (not a priority, I don&#39;t totally agree with the addition of the cake for anything more than a bit of fun).
- Maybe mobs, I&#39;m not too sure about this as it may take away from the minecraft feel..
- I want to make new leaves, but I&#39;m struggling to do this without making them look like total shit. If anyone was able to do them for me (to a sufficient standard mind you) I would happily add them officially, providing they weren&#39;t ripped without permission off of another pack. Until then, I will continue trying myself.
- I kind of want to make a new simpler dirt, but I don&#39;t like making things as basic as a blank 32x32 square with some noise, so I&#39;ll see what I can do. 
- Probably more that I can&#39;t think of right now

[b]What you can do to improve this pack![/b]
Provide feedback, make suggestions for future updates and report issues such as bad tiling. 

[b]Video[/b]
Coming soon, hopefully. Feel free to make your own if you want and I&#39;ll probably add it to this post.

The mob spawner above  is an older version, a newer version with transparency has been made to be able to see the mob inside now.
