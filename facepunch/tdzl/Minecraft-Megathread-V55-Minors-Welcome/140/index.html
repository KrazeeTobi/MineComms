Yogscast is actually half-set up. They have a set plot they&#39;ve made up but their experience is real, and you can see that in certain things, like in the most recent one the Skylord randomly falls in a hole, and they have numerous funny SMP bugs, etc.</span>

- Stabilize;
- Fix bugs with the generator or whatever is causing black blocks and blocks that float in the air possibly;
- Fix bugs with SMP, like horrible boat controls (not sure if that&#39;s limited to SMP, haven&#39;t tried in SP) and chunks not loading (causing voids until the user reconnects);
- Optimize;
- Add more uses to lapis lazuli, maybe dirt, and whatever else isn&#39;t used much;
- Add more weapons possibly, maybe a shield that can block arrows until it breaks;
- Add a server browser;
- Make the game not open a menu when you click somewhere while the Mojang logo is displayed, that&#39;s really annoying, I&#39;ve created new worlds by mistake because of it. Hopefully to be fixed in the next launcher;
- Add more rare stuff, I&#39;ve been underground just a few times and found diamond, obsidian, gold, lapis lazulis and all already. Which leads me to the next one;
- Add some item, or update the compass, to serve the same purpose but be able to point to another place than the spawn;
- Add a craft recipe for mob spawners. You&#39;d have to use some material (obsidian?) in a 9x9 square with the slot in the middle being, for instance, sulphur for creepers, bones for skeletons, porkchop for pigs, etc.;
- Allow players to write and read things in books, and to store written books in bookshelves as well as to retrieve them;
- Decorative furniture I don&#39;t know;
- Beds! And you could sleep in them! An entire day or night cycle would pass, and you would be fully healed. Incorporate an algorithm that would determine whether you are in a safe enough place to sleep without dying from some monster, and then you&#39;d see whether you died or survived the night/day. Only problem is SMP. But it would so much more convenient;
- In the not-so-near future, possibly have a better version of the crafting table that could be used for rare 4x4 recipes? Could be used for more large-scale objects that would occupy more than one block.

Of course, I&#39;m being super optimistic, there are potential problems with these things and Notch won&#39;t have the time to code significant changes.

- Fix bugs with the generator or whatever is causing black blocks and blocks that float in the air possibly;
- Fix bugs with SMP, like horrible boat controls (not sure if that&#39;s limited to SMP, haven&#39;t tried in SP) and chunks not loading (causing voids until the user reconnects);
- Optimize;
- Add more uses to lapis lazuli, maybe dirt, and whatever else isn&#39;t used much;
- Add more weapons possibly, maybe a shield that can block arrows until it breaks;
- Add a server browser;
- Make the game not open a menu when you click somewhere while the Mojang logo is displayed, that&#39;s really annoying, I&#39;ve created new worlds by mistake because of it. Hopefully to be fixed in the next launcher;
- Add more rare stuff, I&#39;ve been underground just a few times and found diamond, obsidian, gold, lapis lazulis and all already. Which leads me to the next one;
- Add some item, or update the compass, to serve the same purpose but be able to point to another place than the spawn;
- Add a craft recipe for mob spawners. You&#39;d have to use some material (obsidian?) in a 9x9 square with the slot in the middle being, for instance, sulphur for creepers, bones for skeletons, porkchop for pigs, etc.;
- Allow players to write and read things in books, and to store written books in bookshelves as well as to retrieve them;
- Decorative furniture I don&#39;t know;
- Beds! And you could sleep in them! An entire day or night cycle would pass, and you would be fully healed. Incorporate an algorithm that would determine whether you are in a safe enough place to sleep without dying from some monster, and then you&#39;d see whether you died or survived the night/day. Only problem is SMP. But it would so much more convenient;
- In the not-so-near future, possibly have a better version of the crafting table that could be used for rare 4x4 recipes? Could be used for more large-scale objects that would occupy more than one block.

Of course, I&#39;m being super optimistic, there are potential problems with these things and Notch won&#39;t have the time to code significant changes.

True true, but at least make it so that you can stack a bunch in the furnace and maybe chests and not in the inventory.

Actually, even without stacking you could easily just set tonnes of porkchops on your bar and you&#39;d have to be really stupid to run out of them while still fighting shit."

If you want sponge again use inv edit if you need it so bad.

Mods are easy to install get &#39;Mod manager&#39; from the mc forums.

So easy to use.
Download the manager and the mods you wish.

Open manager go to open new mod.
Go to your downloads or were ever you put the file.

Click on them then go to finish modding and your done.

If you want sponge again use inv edit if you need it so bad.

Mods are easy to install get &#39;Mod manager&#39; from the mc forums.

So easy to use.
Download the manager and the mods you wish.

Open manager go to open new mod.
Go to your downloads or were ever you put the file.

Click on them then go to finish modding and your done.
