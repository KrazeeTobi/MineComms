&quot;Hey guys I&#39;ve been coding updates for you for the last year or so now, I&#39;m just taking a quick break and playing something I want to for once!&quot;

Notch isn&#39;t hired by anybody, he has no set work times, he can just take breaks when he pleases, I&#39;m sure he would fix a bug that was actually causing damage to the game, but currently you seem to be the only person I have seen complaining their Minecraft doesn&#39;t work. Almost everybody I know can use it just fine."

You&#39;ve [i]obviously[/i] never debugged a single line of code in your life.

Quite clearly me and you are above the low levels on intelligence Toaca has, rating us dumb for proving that their arguments are flawed and mostly retarded.

Indie development isn&#39;t just sitting in front of a PC, coding three lines of code to magically fix everything and pushing it out. it is sitting in front of the PC, reading error log and bug report after bug report from illiterate morons trying to decipher what the fuck they are talking about. Then hoping to dear god the 10, 20 lines of code you change don&#39;t cause any more bugs. A small team like this cannot test the game in every conceivable manner, that is why it is in Beta, for us to find bugs from playing, not for us to play as if it was released.

Stop fucking moaning, find something else to do."

You&#39;ve [i]obviously[/i] never debugged a single line of code in your life.


 
Any other business has teams of 20+ people.[/QUOTE]
 
Quite clearly me and you are above the low levels on intelligence Toaca has, rating us dumb for proving that their arguments are flawed and mostly retarded.

Indie development isn&#39;t just sitting in front of a PC, coding three lines of code to magically fix everything and pushing it out. it is sitting in front of the PC, reading error log and bug report after bug report from illiterate morons trying to decipher what the fuck they are talking about. Then hoping to dear god the 10, 20 lines of code you change don&#39;t cause any more bugs. A small team like this cannot test the game in every conceivable manner, that is why it is in Beta, for us to find bugs from playing, not for us to play as if it was released.

Stop fucking moaning, find something else to do.</span>

We get it, he takes his own breaks and it&#39;s childish. But he DID make this game. So let him take a break, my Minecraft works fine (apart from MP). Singleplayer is still addicting though so be happy with that.

Also, I think there should be a Minecraft subsection.[/QUOTE]

First I&#39;d cancel all over projects and get a hold of my ADD and aspergers syndrome and learn to focus and plan. I would get back to work on developing and FIXING minecraft, leaving Friday and Thursday open for developing special things, and the other days of the week would be bug fixes and maintenance. I would keep a schedule like that. Saturday would be days that I do meetings (for WHAT other than an office and legal). There is nothing business men could offer me, I am already making millions (for now.) 

I will open a poll on Wednesday too, to see what the COMMUNITY would like me to work on, on Thursday and Friday. That would also increase blog traffic, and I would maybe set up Google Adsense there too. I would stop mentioning that I want to do other things and that I&#39;m too lazy to finish up simple things and bug fixes, and I would stop taking luxury, long vacations in the middle of times like this.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=boxxy brown;27756652]If I knew Java, it wouldn&#39;t be hard to get work done. It&#39;d be quite easy, actually. 


First I&#39;d cancel all over projects and get a hold of my ADD and aspergers syndrome and learn to focus and plan. I would get back to work on developing and FIXING minecraft, leaving Friday and Thursday open for developing special things, and the other days of the week would be bug fixes and maintenance. I would keep a schedule like that. Saturday would be days that I do meetings (for WHAT other than an office and legal). There is nothing business men could offer me, I am already making millions (for now.) 

I will open a poll on Wednesday too, to see what the COMMUNITY would like me to work on, on Thursday and Friday. That would also increase blog traffic, and I would maybe set up Google Adsense there too. I would stop mentioning that I want to do other things and that I&#39;m too lazy to finish up simple things and bug fixes, and I would stop taking luxury, long vacations in the middle of times like this. 

And I&#39;d actually enjoy playing the game I made, and I would put my community and my game before my own game playing, for fuck&#39;s sake.[/QUOTE]
