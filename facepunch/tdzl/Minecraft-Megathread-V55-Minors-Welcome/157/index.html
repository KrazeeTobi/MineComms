when building a real house, do you paint the walls before you put them up?[/QUOTE]
 
no, you create blueprints, create small scale models and ensure the fucking thing stands before building anything. Which is what the Alpha had done, once he got the base game working and running to some extent he could then move on to perfecting the design, once all the flaws are out of the way, then the game can be built. SMP not working constantly is one of the flaw he would be working on before finishing up the game, it really is not a hard concept to grasp."

no, you create blueprints, create small scale models and ensure the fucking thing stands before building anything. Which is what the Alpha had done, once he got the base game working and running to some extent he could then move on to perfecting the design, once all the flaws are out of the way, then the game can be built.

He even stated that he had no intention of making Minecraft this big in the baby steps of its development. All of this was completely unplanned and unprecedented.
The community made it bigger than he can handle.

Look at their forums.
Look at yourself.
Look at how many threads we&#39;ve gone through.
Look at his sales.

The fact that he can&#39;t manage his game to the degree that you demand of him is not his fault."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=boxxy brown;27756876]Notch didn&#39;t plan his project properly. He didn&#39;t plan it within his means and skills, he didn&#39;t develop it with a structure. He just did what he felt like on a whim, and he continues to do that within a business environment while he has financial backers. He&#39;s going to fuck up hard in the business world. He&#39;s a victim of his success, a shitty businessman breaking his promises. Neither are necessarily his fault, any more of a fat guys fault that he can&#39;t suddenly run a marathon.[/QUOTE]
 
He even stated that he had no intention of making Minecraft this big in the baby steps of its development. All of this was completely unplanned and unprecedented.
The community made it bigger than he can handle.

Look at their forums.
Look at yourself.
Look at how many threads we&#39;ve gone through.
Look at his sales.

The fact that he can&#39;t manage his game to the degree that you demand of him is not his fault.</span>
