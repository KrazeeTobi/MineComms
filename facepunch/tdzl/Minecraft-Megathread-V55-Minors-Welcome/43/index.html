The entire map will be new, and everything will have to be built by scratch. No cheating by adding things in!

There will probably be rounds, which will last for a month or two. Then the map is reset again with brand new kingdoms and styles.

I&#39;m thinking about letting the nations work out their own borders (within fairness), then using the city watch / police to moderate skirmishes between nations that will dictate changes. Maybe split the map into regions or something, not sure yet.

[QUOTE=Shadowstone;27623730]Yes, that sounds reasonable. Additionally, I had an idea for the three factions on the server. Taken from series such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, we could have Earth, Water, and Fire factions (we could use wind as a fourth, although they&#39;re extinct in The Last Airbender, and air is hard to use in minecraft so it works out). 

The [B]fire tribe[/B] will be dressed in red satin robes, with golden wrist bands and neckbands. Their villages/country will be similar to that of the Nether if possible, and it could be possible to get netherstone for building (An admin would have to do this). Lava and red-dyed wool can be incorporated, as well as anything else people have ideas for. Their homes will be mostly built of cobblestone and nether-stone, with  slowsand and lightstone used on the side (Again, if possible). Lava will  have a large presence. The flag is Red, Black, and Orange.

The [B]water tribe[/B] will be dressed in light and dark blue robes, with incorporation of white signifying the coldness of winter. Their country/villages will be made of water, with waterfalls, water fountains, and possibly ice and snow around it. It would be best to make a winter biome for this faction. Their homes will be built of glass, so as to encompass the idea of transparency. Their homes will/can also be built partially underwater. Their flag is blue and white.

Lastly, the [B]Earth Tribe[/B] will be dressed in light green robes, with brown embroidering and dark green wrist bands. Their land will, obviously, be composed of mostly earth, with wooden homes. Cobblestone is not abundant, but has a definite presence. They are also able to use resources with more intelligence and at a quicker pace than the other factions. Their homes will be built of wood and some cobblestone. The flag will be green and brown.[/QUOTE]
 
This is a good start and along the right lines, but don&#39;t be limited to what&#39;s already in Minecraft. Imagine it this way, each faction will have a few different types of building block relevant to their theme (which is up to your imagination), then an ore which is unique to them (so they can make their national armour).

[QUOTE=Shadowstone;27623745]Oh, also, if this server grows to something large, I think it may be suitable to create a separate thread, so as to not muck up the main megathread.[/QUOTE]

This is a good start and along the right lines, but don&#39;t be limited to what&#39;s already in Minecraft. Imagine it this way, each faction will have a few different types of building block relevant to their theme (which is up to your imagination), then an ore which is unique to them (so they can make their national armour).


 
Yes, I will be doing this eventually. For now though, discussion can stay in here until it takes off.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Hezzy;27623955]The entire map will be new, and everything will have to be built by scratch. No cheating by adding things in!

There will probably be rounds, which will last for a month or two. Then the map is reset again with brand new kingdoms and styles.


 
I&#39;m thinking about letting the nations work out their own borders (within fairness), then using the city watch / police to moderate skirmishes between nations that will dictate changes. Maybe split the map into regions or something, not sure yet.


 
This is a good start and along the right lines, but don&#39;t be limited to what&#39;s already in Minecraft. Imagine it this way, each faction will have a few different types of building block relevant to their theme (which is up to your imagination), then an ore which is unique to them (so they can make their national armour).


 
Yes, I will be doing this eventually. For now though, discussion can stay in here until it takes off.


I&#39;ll have a bit of a ponder and try and come up with some ideas for the nation while I&#39;m at work tomorrow!

If anyone has some good ideas, be sure to write on my profile page or send me a PM.[/QUOTE]
 
Great to hear. I&#39;ll be PMing you with my ideas and some mockups for ore materials.</span>

I was using the sand / dirt thing as an example. What I was saying was that the nation blocks will look completely different and will replace other blocks. Like I don&#39;t know, maybe obsidian would become red kingdom&#39;s main building block - it&#39;s attributes would be changed to be similar to dirt and a custom texture would be applied to make it relevant to the red kingdom&#39;s architectural motif 

I made a post earlier about building styles and I said something like it&#39;d work on different levels. You&#39;ve got people building stuff out of common materials to their kingdom (which will be shaded to correspond with the kingdom&#39;s colour) and they&#39;ll also be built in a certain architectural style, for example the shapes of the buildings may all be similar - perhaps a motif of a certain kingdom will to build partially underground. Another may be that they build on the water. Another may be that they use extensive use of overhangs and columns. I don&#39;t know yet, it&#39;s something that&#39;ll be really exciting to think about and I&#39;d want a lot of help from the community to come up with them all.

Just a thought on that, rather than going through the effort of tinkering with all those different blocks&#39; attributes, perhaps each nation could have a couple of colours of wool?

Each &#39;colour&#39; of wool block can be skinned to be anything you want, they don&#39;t all have to look like shades of eachother. That way only a texture pack is needed rather than mods that change blocks :buddy:"

Honestly. I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t just let them use all the blocks in Minecraft and then just assign a color to each kingdom. Then they can dye cloth and use that."
