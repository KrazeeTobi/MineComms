You spawn infront of this little house:

Then you go inside and go down this ladder: (this was a natural hole I just smoothed it out)

View looking up from the bottom:

It goes to the right into this natural round cave, where I make basecap, the left and right shafts are just mine entrences:

That glass floor has something special below it. Yep. Its a LITTLE PARADISE

Yep, Pretty nice place:

It has a little waterfall with a river running through the entire garden

For one, he took a vacation for Christmas and the New Year, which was not even a month ago.
Second, if I can deal with working all week long and have one day off per month (and the acceptable breaks in summer and winter), I don&#39;t see why he can&#39;t. He has his own office with a fucking TV and video games, computers and shit and he&#39;s still too lazy to go there every weekday. I sit on hard chairs in classes listening to boring as fuck lectures. Come on."
