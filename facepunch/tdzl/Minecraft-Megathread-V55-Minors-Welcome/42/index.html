As for the nation model, then they would definitely have to use it or they wouldn&#39;t be able to play on the server.[/QUOTE]
 
Yes, that sounds reasonable. Additionally, I had an idea for the three factions on the server. Taken from series such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, we could have Earth, Water, and Fire factions (we could use wind as a fourth, although they&#39;re extinct in The Last Airbender, and air is hard to use in minecraft so it works out). 

The [B]fire tribe[/B] will be dressed in red satin robes, with golden wrist bands and neckbands. Their villages/country will be similar to that of the Nether if possible, and it could be possible to get netherstone for building (An admin would have to do this). Lava and red-dyed wool can be incorporated, as well as anything else people have ideas for. Their homes will be mostly built of cobblestone and nether-stone, with  slowsand and lightstone used on the side (Again, if possible). Lava will  have a large presence. The flag is Red, Black, and Orange.

The [B]water tribe[/B] will be dressed in light and dark blue robes, with incorporation of white signifying the coldness of winter. Their country/villages will be made of water, with waterfalls, water fountains, and possibly ice and snow around it. It would be best to make a winter biome for this faction. Their homes will be built of glass, so as to encompass the idea of transparency. Their homes will/can also be built partially underwater. Their flag is blue and white.

Lastly, the [B]Earth Tribe[/B] will be dressed in light green robes, with brown embroidering and dark green wrist bands. Their land will, obviously, be composed of mostly earth, with wooden homes. Cobblestone is not abundant, but has a definite presence. They are also able to use resources with more intelligence and at a quicker pace than the other factions. Their homes will be built of wood and some cobblestone. The flag will be green and brown."

As for the nation model, then they would definitely have to use it or they wouldn&#39;t be able to play on the server.[/QUOTE]
 
Yes, that sounds reasonable. Additionally, I had an idea for the three factions on the server. Taken from series such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, we could have Earth, Water, and Fire factions (we could use wind as a fourth, although they&#39;re extinct in The Last Airbender, and air is hard to use in minecraft so it works out). 

The [B]fire tribe[/B] will be dressed in red satin robes, with golden wrist bands and neckbands. Their villages/country will be similar to that of the Nether if possible, and it could be possible to get netherstone for building (An admin would have to do this). Lava and red-dyed wool can be incorporated, as well as anything else people have ideas for. Their homes will be mostly built of cobblestone and nether-stone, with  slowsand and lightstone used on the side (Again, if possible). Lava will  have a large presence. The flag is Red, Black, and Orange.

The [B]water tribe[/B] will be dressed in light and dark blue robes, with incorporation of white signifying the coldness of winter. Their country/villages will be made of water, with waterfalls, water fountains, and possibly ice and snow around it. It would be best to make a winter biome for this faction. Their homes will be built of glass, so as to encompass the idea of transparency. Their homes will/can also be built partially underwater. Their flag is blue and white.

Lastly, the [B]Earth Tribe[/B] will be dressed in light green robes, with brown embroidering and dark green wrist bands. Their land will, obviously, be composed of mostly earth, with wooden homes. Cobblestone is not abundant, but has a definite presence. They are also able to use resources with more intelligence and at a quicker pace than the other factions. Their homes will be built of wood and some cobblestone. The flag will be green and brown.</span>

 If so VG group would fit water tribe or earth tribe, not one single bit of netherrack on our map...other than our nether.
Also a seperate chat for certain areas would be needed for secret sabotages or agreements and general group chat etc."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Shadowstone;27623730]Yes, that sounds reasonable. Additionally, I had an idea for the three factions on the server. Taken from series such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, we could have Earth, Water, and Fire factions (we could use wind as a fourth, although they&#39;re extinct in The Last Airbender, and air is hard to use in minecraft so it works out). 

The [B]fire tribe[/B] will be dressed in red satin robes, with golden wrist bands and neckbands. Their villages/country will be similar to that of the Nether if possible, and it could be possible to get netherstone for building (An admin would have to do this). Lava and red-dyed wool can be incorporated, as well as anything else people have ideas for. Their homes will be mostly built of cobblestone and nether-stone, with  slowsand and lightstone used on the side (Again, if possible). Lava will  have a large presence. The flag is Red, Black, and Orange.

The [B]water tribe[/B] will be dressed in light and dark blue robes, with incorporation of white signifying the coldness of winter. Their country/villages will be made of water, with waterfalls, water fountains, and possibly ice and snow around it. It would be best to make a winter biome for this faction. Their homes will be built of glass, so as to encompass the idea of transparency. Their homes will/can also be built partially underwater. Their flag is blue and white.

Lastly, the [B]Earth Tribe[/B] will be dressed in light green robes, with brown embroidering and dark green wrist bands. Their land will, obviously, be composed of mostly earth, with wooden homes. Cobblestone is not abundant, but has a definite presence. They are also able to use resources with more intelligence and at a quicker pace than the other factions. Their homes will be built of wood and some cobblestone. The flag will be green and brown.[/QUOTE]
 If so VG group would fit water tribe or earth tribe, not one single bit of netherrack on our map...other than our nether.
Also a seperate chat for certain areas would be needed for secret sabotages or agreements and general group chat etc.</span>
