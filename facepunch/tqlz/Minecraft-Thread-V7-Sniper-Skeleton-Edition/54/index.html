That&#39;s why you find a good server to join. SOmeone&#39;s bound to respond to you with their server link :D</span>

Don&#39;t get me wrong, Survival is awesome, but not for long run. And &quot;creative multiplayer&quot; is even more horrible. I can&#39;t find nice server with good admins instead of anti-griefing plugin. 3-4 servers I joined are full of kids that want to change map after 30-40 minutes because &quot;they are bored&quot;. Flatgrass servers are made of bullshit, boring and ugly sprites. Or, oh, lava server.
I finally made my nice wooden fortress. City for everyone. Wait, what the fuck? Admin comes and builds his shit with op block all over my place. I tell him to stop doing that, &quot;stop whining&quot; - kick. Okay, I get it, bad admins, not game. But this happens on most of the servers. Community is horrible - and please, don&#39;t say that I play on shit servers. 10-15 servers with 6+ players and they are shit. Call me stupid because I play on bad servers - hello, I don&#39;t know which one is good and which one is bad by name.

Yeah, most of the servers out there are pretty shitty. You should join either yum&#39;s server or my server. Both have an antigriefing &#39;plugin&#39;, but I know I have a public world, and I think yum has one. We normally won&#39;t kick you for bullshit.
