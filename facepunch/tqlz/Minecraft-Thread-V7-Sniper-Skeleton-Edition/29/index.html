Relatively easy to sort this out with NBT Forge, don&#39;t use Omen though as with the current version it&#39;ll bugger your chests, while NBT Forge seems to leave them alone. (I haven&#39;t tried it since furnaces etc, so make sure you make a backup first)"

Unfortunately there is a [b]critical[/b] bug which confuses the end of the level lava with normal OP blocks when you save. When I load my save the bottom of my fort is made of lava.

And in my save I happen to be standing right in it.[/QUOTE]

Relatively easy to sort this out with NBT Forge, don&#39;t use Omen though as with the current version it&#39;ll bugger your chests, while NBT Forge seems to leave them alone. (I haven&#39;t tried it since furnaces etc, so make sure you make a backup first)</span>

&quot;cut trees and farm during the day, work in the mines at night&quot; seems to work pretty well, but I can see what you&#39;re saying, the first few days usually do result in sitting in a house for 15 minutes because there&#39;s not enough resources to mine, usually not having enough coal for torches or not enough wood

I&#39;m sorry? Anyone retarded enough to not go straight out and cut down AT LEAST 20-30 wood is an idiot. There is NO reason to be sitting in your house for 15 minutes. 15 minutes daylight is more than enough time to go out, get some wood, kill a few pigs and prospect around for any lucky veins of coal / iron.

When it starts turning to night time, casually make your way back to your base. It takes a whole 2 minutes or so to actually become night time when mobs spawn. During night time, just dig a mine shaft in your spawn base. Simple as.

Also, having no torches at the beginning is a problem, and I guess now that you gotta make flint it&#39;s even MORE of a problem. But why not just take a torch from your spawnhouse? One torch above and one below is enough to keep mobs away. Just place it somewhere strategically so it lights as much as possible.

PS: I know it&#39;s impossible to do now, but setting up little bonfires with wood and setting it alight with flint was a good beginner way to light tunnels, until coal was found. Not do-able now, seeing as you need iron and you need coal to smelt it into iron to make flint :p"

You can also burn blocks of wood. Not nearly as efficient but it&#39;s handy when there&#39;s no coal available and you want to get iron tools instead of just mucking about in mines until you happen to stumble upon coal.

There is NO reason to be sitting in your house for 15 minutes. 15 minutes daylight is more than enough time to go out, get some wood, kill a few pigs and prospect around for any lucky veins of coal / iron.

When it starts turning to night time, casually make your way back to your base. It takes a whole 2 minutes or so to actually become night time when mobs spawn. During night time, just dig a mine shaft in your spawn base. Simple as.

Also, having no torches at the beginning is a problem, and I guess now that you gotta make flint it&#39;s even MORE of a problem. But why not just take a torch from your spawnhouse? One torch above and one below is enough to keep mobs away. Just place it somewhere strategically so it lights as much as possible.

PS: I know it&#39;s impossible to do now, but setting up little bonfires with wood and setting it alight with flint was a good beginner way to light tunnels, until coal was found. Not do-able now, seeing as you need iron and you need coal to smelt it into iron to make flint :p[/QUOTE]

I&#39;m not saying night is difficult or anything, I&#39;m saying we shouldn&#39;t get a way to speed up time and instead get generally more stuff to do at night other than mine
people really want a sleep or wait function or something but it wouldn&#39;t be needed if night wasn&#39;t so boring
more ways of getting light and, well, maybe some higher rewards for hunting monsters would fix this right up, I&#39;d just go outside and beat spiders to death with my hands if they all dropped food and more than one string at a time

oh yeah and it&#39;s almost always not enough coal over not enough wood, digging a mineshaft without any torches is a pretty bad idea and two torches ain&#39;t gonna light a mine bigger than a broom closet

then again I guess &quot;all you do at night is mine&quot; is basically half the game anyway, the game is about mining after all
I also really like building shit with the stone you get from mining and that isn&#39;t possible at night, when I run out of torches (64 torches go pretty fast in a deep map) I usually return to the surface to build shit, if it&#39;s night time, well, you can&#39;t build shit easily at night
yet again I&#39;d do it anyway if killing monsters was more worthwhile

A lot of your problems can be solved easily. All you gotta do is build a wall that is three bricks high surrounding whatever land you want to build on. Seeing as most people build things that resemble medieval castles, this would most likely end up being your outer wall. Then you can safely build at night time (on the 3rd or 4th night) when you have enough torches to stop any mobs spawning inside. Obviously you gotta compensate for any dirt that might provide a jumping platform for spiders. Once you got that, it&#39;s so safe and easy to build at night.

Also, the whole torches thing. There is coal EVERYWHERE. There is so much of the damn stuff :p At least now with furnaces it&#39;ll be more needed. But like I said, one torch is enough to keep monsters from spawning. And all you gotta do is branch out real quick till you find a coal vein. Mine out 2-3 (doesn&#39;t have to be the whole vein) and make some torches. Then you can re-arrange your torch design so it&#39;s much lighter.

And another problem you had was using up way too many torches. Mobs will only spawn in pitch black and one-shade less than pitch black squares. They don&#39;t spawn in semi-light squares. You should be using one torch every 20-30 blocks or so. Unless it&#39;s a big room.

And seeing as it&#39;s a mine, you don&#39;t have to keep EVERYTHING open. Feel free to re-collect torches in times of need and seal the mine up, either for good, or for the time being. That way, you can expand in another direction. You just gotta be intuitive, and not be so linear :p

And mining, how you say it, makes it seem so boring. It&#39;s loads of fun digging out an underground base. As well as building a huge spire that projects from the center of said underground base to the surface. It&#39;s friggin sweet.

Oh, I completely misread what you said :p Sorry.[/QUOTE]

I used to dig out huge cave systems, use a light amount of torches to stretch the light out, but no, monsters will still spawn, haha, in fact, you actually need to light the damn ceiling in caves because they can spawn up there and immediately drop down to the lit areas
goddamn I hated getting spider bombed from the ceiling

also I&#39;m pretty sure monsters don&#39;t need completely pitch black areas to spawn, they used to spawn in old hell maps perfectly fine, they were only dark, but not pitch black.

oh yes keep in mind this is all in the first few days of any new game, once the ball is rolling, it&#39;s pretty much good for anything at any time of day
I have no problems with this shit at all, in fact I&#39;d turn it down from hard if I did, but I hear people complain about this stuff all the time and I know what they mean
I don&#39;t play on hell maps anymore because you can&#39;t farm on them though, such a shame, an island base surrounded by lava like the one I have a picture of in the OP was a great defense

The creepers didn&#39;t kill me, though they are annoying. Dunno how they blow a hole in your house though, they only blow up if you&#39;re next to em. As soon as you run away, they defuse and start following again.

Also, Notch made it so they won&#39;t blow up if they&#39;re on the other side of a wall. Which is awesome :D

Also, decided to stop work on my castle. It&#39;s doing it&#39;s job now. All I&#39;d end up doing is making it look nicer.

Making an express tunnel to my quarry (a nice smoothed out tunnel that isn&#39;t cramped. Allows me to run fast between resource-rich areas [a huge cavern] and my base) which should take a few days. It&#39;s a long way to get there, and I want everything smooth, no jagged pieces of rock. Want it civilised, damn it!"

Also, decided to stop work on my castle. It&#39;s doing it&#39;s job now. All I&#39;d end up doing is making it look nicer.

Making an express tunnel to my quarry (a nice smoothed out tunnel that isn&#39;t cramped. Allows me to run fast between resource-rich areas [a huge cavern] and my base) which should take a few days. It&#39;s a long way to get there, and I want everything smooth, no jagged pieces of rock. Want it civilised, damn it![/QUOTE]
