If anything, anti-aliasing would help to sharpen the &#39;block&#39; feeling of everything by defining hard edges better when looking at blocks[/QUOTE]
I don&#39;t think traditional anti-aliasing would work in Minecraft. In order to be efficient the engine would need to determine which edges of blocks need smoothing, since most edges are just part of larger flat surfaces. But that would probably be really costly and not worth the slight visual improvement."

If anything, anti-aliasing would help to sharpen the &#39;block&#39; feeling of everything by defining hard edges better when looking at blocks[/QUOTE]
I don&#39;t think traditional anti-aliasing would work in Minecraft. In order to be efficient the engine would need to determine which edges of blocks need smoothing, since most edges are just part of larger flat surfaces. But that would probably be really costly and not worth the slight visual improvement.</span>

I can almost imagine some graphics whore making a Bloom emulator for this game.

Then again, it worked great with infiniminer.

Maybe a bloom setting that ONLY works on the sky/lava? I know it messes with the style a bit, but it would satisfy the people who constantly message notch over it."

That&#39;s awesome, I hope you manage to complete that.

I just had an idea for INDEV infinite worlds, for multiplayer, where maybe it would be possible for people to take their own saves, and put them on their own minecraft &quot;Earth&quot;, which would be used as their starting location while all the world is generated around it.

And I REALLY hope notch adds snow and ice. And weather cycles, but first we shall patiently wait for him to finish his near-infinite awesome.

I mean, snow and ice textures for everything would be awesome, and would add a lot of variety to what kind of place the area you discover turns out to be. Who knows, you might end up travelling across the sea so far, that you discover a huge island of snow and ice without any trees that would resemble a minecraft antarctica."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=D0C H.;20414055]Also im looking for suggestions. I LOVE this game. but now that I have an impermeable castle, large enough wheat farm, huge tree farm and massive mining operation. i dont know what to to. do torches keep away monsters?  I will only see one monster per night IF IM LUCKY. Toss out any sudjestions you got because I dont want this game to become boring so fast, nor do I want to start again. i just want an onslought of monster like I used to get :saddowns:

Not super long. just create a mine from inside your house and during the night mine stones, and during the day build a bigger house, gather wheat/wood/food ect. repeat.

AND I can NEVER find creepers to get gunpowder! :argh:[/QUOTE]

Put difficulty up, and yes, torches generate light areas and monsters only spawn in dark ones.</span>
