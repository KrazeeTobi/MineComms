There are so, SOOOOOO many things wrong with this post.

1. Nothing burns up during the night what the hell

2. Creepers (the blow up zombies) don&#39;t burn up during the day

3. The noises and burning you heard were regular zombies and skeletons

4. Spiders do not attack during the day unless you get too close or attack them

5. &#39;Blow up zombies&#39; don&#39;t explode unless you hit them

6. They also make noise. The FFFFFFFFFFFSSSSSSSSSS didn&#39;t tip you off that they were about to explode?

That&#39;s pretty much what I play it like. :v:

I also just lost about... the last 45 minutes of progress, so I lost that. I dug down in a little island since I burnt the main island, so all the mobs were outside the walls of my island like this:

Sorry, wrote it real late, I&#39;m dead tired. I meant burning during the day. And I thought blow up zombies DID die during the day.

Also, they go Fssssshhhhh when they get near you. When you hit them, they don&#39;t explode unless you&#39;re near them for more than a second. Also, they can un-bomb themselves (if they set their timer off, they can turn it off again to follow you). And spiders DO attack in the day time if you aggroed them in the night. It&#39;s as if they don&#39;t lose aggro if you hit them before.

And the blow up zombie fuse sound is only a 2 second warning, barely enough time to run. And it was me get blown up by him, or jump down a 6 z-level high cliff and die with my half heart left."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Teh Zip File;20240488]That&#39;s pretty much what I play it like. :v:

I also just lost about... the last 45 minutes of progress, so I lost that. I dug down in a little island since I burnt the main island, so all the mobs were outside the walls of my island like this:

Now every now and again when I go up there a skeleton shoots an arrow and hits one of the exploding ones so it goes over the walls. This happened, it exploded and took out some walls. Water was rushing in, I blocked it and ran down the stairs to block it from going down more...

...A skeleton follows me in and kills me. :saddowns:
