I came up with an idea for a map system while I was on the shitter.

So, you&#39;ve made a house, but you&#39;ve mind the island dry. You think &quot;Well, it&#39;s about time I migrate I guess&quot;. But wait, there&#39;s a problem. There&#39;s no way you can transport all your valuables in one trip. Now, you COULD make a bridge, but that could take hours, and what about if you come upon an island without any mines? You&#39;d have to run to the other end and start your bridge again.

But instead of that, how about this: Your game automatically maps the island you start on, and a certain area around your character if you travel off the mapped area. So instead of spending many tedious hours building a bridge, you can just go in any direction you&#39;d like, and then follow the path the map marked pack.


Sound like a good idea?"

I came up with an idea for a map system while I was on the shitter.

So, you&#39;ve made a house, but you&#39;ve mind the island dry. You think &quot;Well, it&#39;s about time I migrate I guess&quot;. But wait, there&#39;s a problem. There&#39;s no way you can transport all your valuables in one trip. Now, you COULD make a bridge, but that could take hours, and what about if you come upon an island without any mines? You&#39;d have to run to the other end and start your bridge again.

But instead of that, how about this: Your game automatically maps the island you start on, and a certain area around your character if you travel off the mapped area. So instead of spending many tedious hours building a bridge, you can just go in any direction you&#39;d like, and then follow the path the map marked pack.

Sarcasm. It doesn&#39;t translate well in to text. I still think a map would be pretty cool.</span>

A map would be useful and cool but there&#39;s no reason it should have to point at your main base. A simple map would be very useful but it has to be achievable. not just handed to you at the beginning of ever save."

I think we should just be able to craft a big scroll out of paper and sticks. You can free hand right or draw on it and so you should be able to plot out features as you go in a personal way.

That said, some people may not be artistic enough or whatever for it, but then it would be interesting to be a cartographer in SMP as a job for someone who is good at drawing them."

I think we should just be able to craft a big scroll out of paper and sticks. You can free hand right or draw on it and so you should be able to plot out features as you go in a personal way.

That said, some people may not be artistic enough or whatever for it, but then it would be interesting to be a cartographer in SMP as a job for someone who is good at drawing them.</span>

I found an awesome waterfall like that once. I was exploring a cave system with a tonne of water flows. After crossing a number of them the cave went up a steep shaft. 

At the top was another water flow that I covered so I could get through easier. After that the cave ended so I backtracked down the shaft.

It turned out that some of the water flows were connected and the one I blocked caused another &#39;river&#39; right down the bottom to clear, revealing 6 diamonds that were previously hidden by the water. It was like some awesome Indiana Jones style puzzle to find the treasure :v:"
