Play in browser?

Repost for new page:
[quote=Hesychasmos]Maybe I&#39;m late on this, but mobs attack each other. I was hiding up a  ladder and looking down at two skeletons, and I was about one block  within safety of any arrows they shot up -- AND THEN IT HAPPENED. One of  the arrows fell back down on a skeleton. I saw it coming, I was hoping  it would happen, but what I wasn&#39;t expecting is that they would start  bitching and attacking each other. :iia:

Seeing as this could only happen due to skeletons, I wonder how other  mobs react. I know that creepers drop records when shot by skeletons,  but do they attack back first?[/quote]

Page king content:
Here&#39;s what I just started working on. I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll probably replace the wood with stone so that I don&#39;t suicide when it burns down (because it would with my luck).

In the past month he has released Survival Multiplayer, taken a PLANE TRIP TO AMERICA TO VISIT VALVE to discuss marketing his game, started his own business, gone through dozens of applications, and is slowly beginning to select members all the while trying to make an update for sorry ungrateful assholes like you. Saying he&#39;s lazy isn&#39;t just your opinion, it&#39;s outright incorrect, because he&#39;s probably been working harder on his game than you have on anything in your life recently, pal. He didn&#39;t say Friday was the only day he could update, he NEVER said that. The fanbase demanded that he update on Friday and that became the tradition and GOD FORBID he stops for a week or two because that means he will NEVER UPDATE AGAIN AND I PAID THE PRICE OF A PIZZA FOR THIS GAME AND WAAAAH WAAAH WAAAH.[/QUOTE]

Can you honestly get out. You come in here and say you guys don&#39;t know shit about notch yet you ramble on about this bullshit that you don&#39;t know about.

[quote]taken a PLANE TRIP TO AMERICA TO VISIT VALVE to discuss marketing his game[/quote]

How do you know he went to discuss marketing? Wait... you don&#39;t. He might of gone to see valve to maybe take a tour or had a beer with someone.

[quote] gone through dozens of applications, and is slowly beginning to select members all the while trying to make an update for sorry ungrateful assholes like you.[/quote] 

Do you work for notch? Have you seen him go through the applications? No? Then STFU.

[quote]NEVER UPDATE AGAIN AND I PAID THE PRICE OF A PIZZA FOR THIS GAME AND WAAAAH WAAAH WAAAH[/quote]

Pizza is $10 here. Where is my $3.

But really stop quoting every person god dam post saying they don&#39;t know shit. You obviously don&#39;t know either.

He does not have to update the game if he doesn&#39;t want to, he can say &quot;fuck you&quot; and never update again and you&#39;d have to sit there and take it because you didn&#39;t pay for a full game and you shouldn&#39;t expect him to give you one the instant you ask for it.



In the past month he has released Survival Multiplayer, taken a PLANE TRIP TO AMERICA TO VISIT VALVE to discuss marketing his game, started his own business, gone through dozens of applications, and is slowly beginning to select members all the while trying to make an update for sorry ungrateful assholes like you. Saying he&#39;s lazy isn&#39;t just your opinion, it&#39;s outright incorrect, because he&#39;s probably been working harder on his game than you have on anything in your life recently, pal. He didn&#39;t say Friday was the only day he could update, he NEVER said that. The fanbase demanded that he update on Friday and that became the tradition and GOD FORBID he stops for a week or two because that means he will NEVER UPDATE AGAIN AND I PAID THE PRICE OF A PIZZA FOR THIS GAME AND WAAAAH WAAAH WAAAH.[/QUOTE]

Can you honestly get out. You come in here and say you guys don&#39;t know shit about notch yet you ramble on about this bullshit that you don&#39;t know about.

[quote]taken a PLANE TRIP TO AMERICA TO VISIT VALVE to discuss marketing his game[/quote]

How do you know he went to discuss marketing? Wait... you don&#39;t. He might of gone to see valve to maybe take a tour or had a beer with someone.

[quote] gone through dozens of applications, and is slowly beginning to select members all the while trying to make an update for sorry ungrateful assholes like you.[/quote] 

Do you work for notch? Have you seen him go through the applications? No? Then STFU.

[quote]NEVER UPDATE AGAIN AND I PAID THE PRICE OF A PIZZA FOR THIS GAME AND WAAAAH WAAAH WAAAH[/quote]

Pizza is $10 here. Where is my $3.

How do you know he went to discuss marketing? Wait... you don&#39;t. He might of gone to see valve to maybe take a tour or had a beer with someone.

 

Do you work for notch? Have you seen him go through the applications? No? Then STFU.


Pizza is $10 here. Where is my $3.

But really stop quoting every person god dam post saying they don&#39;t know shit. You obviously don&#39;t know either.



Your an idiot. Thats my opinion[/QUOTE]

How do you know he went to discuss marketing? Wait... you don&#39;t. He might of gone to see valve to maybe take a tour or had a beer with someone.

 

Do you work for notch? Have you seen him go through the applications? No? Then STFU.



Pizza is $10 here. Where is my $3.

But really stop quoting every person god dam post saying they don&#39;t know shit. You obviously don&#39;t know either.



Your an idiot. Thats my opinion[/QUOTE]

You are a terrible poster.

We know he went there to discuss marketing because he said so in his blog, so take the time to learn how to read.  He is going through hiring people and has been having trouble with the servers lately.

A a pizza is $13 here and even then it doesn&#39;t matter, you get the point that it is close to a pizza so stop nit picking, looking for arguments.
