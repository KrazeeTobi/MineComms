Texture packs are client side, hence editing your minecraft.jar. The only reason you have to reinstall texture packs each update is because the updates overwrite the minecraft.jar file.

Player skins are technically not client side and are bound to your account."

[QUOTE=Radiosquid;24967180]I&#39;ve been working on a Halloween texture pack for the past week. I was planning on releasing it through the Minecraft forums, but seeing as they&#39;re down I&#39;ll release it here for anyone who&#39;s interested.

[QUOTE=Radiosquid;24967180]I&#39;ve been working on a Halloween texture pack for the past week. I was planning on releasing it through the Minecraft forums, but seeing as they&#39;re down I&#39;ll release it here for anyone who&#39;s interested.

I believe I read on the Developer&#39;s blog that Paypal has had so many people buying Minecraft today that they&#39;re having a slight back up.
So it might be an hour or so until you can play if that&#39;s still the case."
