Why the fuck would I ever want to make a tunnel connecting my base to another persons base?
 
One, that&#39;s a huge waste of time to dig out. Two, my base is and would be fucking far away from anyone else. Three, I don&#39;t trust anyone that&#39;s not at my base (and there&#39;s only two people including myself at my base) to have access to my base. Four, whats to stop us from just making floating cities and shit and cutting ourselves off from mobs permanently?

Plus it has nothing to do with the vanilla spirit that 2b2t has, who are the server&#39;s main audience. And even if you make a server with that, afaik there aren&#39;t any released mods like it so you&#39;d have to make it yourself, and you&#39;d have an extremely difficult time creating a new playerbase for it.

Plus you haven&#39;t said anything regarding the role of admins or moderators on the server, both of which are elements that we would never want"

One, that&#39;s a huge waste of time to dig out. Two, my base is and would be fucking far away from anyone else. Three, I don&#39;t trust anyone that&#39;s not at my base (and there&#39;s only two people including myself at my base) to have access to my base. Four, whats to stop us from just making floating cities and shit and cutting ourselves off from mobs permanently?

Plus it has nothing to do with the vanilla spirit that 2b2t has, who are the server&#39;s main audience. And even if you make a server with that, afaik there aren&#39;t any released mods like it so you&#39;d have to make it yourself, and you&#39;d have an extremely difficult time creating a new playerbase for it.

                            <span v-pre>Ok I&#39;ve been working on this the last hour or so. What do you think? It should generate random cave biomes (all biome types) in this fashion. The top of the map is covered with a 1 block thick layer of bedrock. Although it seems to not be perfect yet and player can through in certain biomes.

[B]These areas are pretty dark because of the bedrock layer above, blocking out the sun.[/B]

And here&#39;s how the cave generation looks with the bedrock layer gone. Looks prettier but doesn&#39;t maintain the darkness we probably want.

You&#39;re comparing a server with rules &amp; roleplay to a server where there will be no rules &amp; roleplay. Apples &amp; oranges. A 2b2t-like server interests me because it is a complete contrast to The Ancient World and I wouldn&#39;t mind funding such a server so long as people are enjoying their time on it. Why would I make it anything like my other server? That just defeats the purpose.

Oh I remember now.. Yeah I banned you guys for building a swastika. Then you denied you ever did it and that was the end of it. If you really didn&#39;t build a swastika then it was a misunderstanding if anything. I really do believe what I saw was a swastika made from cobblestone."

You&#39;re comparing a server with rules &amp; roleplay to a server where there will be no rules &amp; roleplay. Apples &amp; oranges. A 2b2t-like server interests me because it is a complete contrast to The Ancient World and I wouldn&#39;t mind funding such a server so long as people are enjoying their time on it. Why would I make it anything like my other server? That just defeats the purpose.

Oh I remember now.. Yeah I banned you guys for building a swastika. Then you denied you ever did it and that was the end of it. If you really didn&#39;t build a swastika then it was a misunderstanding if anything. I really do believe what I saw was a swastika made from cobblestone.</span>

This would probably be a good time to inform you that several people have tried appealing to 2b2t players in the past and not once have any of their servers lasted more than a couple weeks. The biggest part of 2b2t is the history and that&#39;s not something you can recreate."

Good point. I&#39;m not really looking for 2b2t&#39;s level of success. I just think it would be a good substitute server to my own, as players can sometimes get bored at the lack of PVP &amp; endless exploration on our RP map.

Oh I remember now.. Yeah I banned you guys for building a swastika. Then you denied you ever did it and that was the end of it. If you really didn&#39;t build a swastika then it was a misunderstanding if anything. I really do believe what I saw was a swastika made from cobblestone.[/QUOTE]


If your trying to draw players from 2b2t im afraid the only crowd you will draw in are new fags who quit 2b2t because they cant get 10 feet out of spawn. By all means give it a shot but as Gman said you cant recreate the history of 2b2t and the swastikas were for the glory of Hitler of course!"
