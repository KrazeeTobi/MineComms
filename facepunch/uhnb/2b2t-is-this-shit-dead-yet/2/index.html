I did kind of get lost in my own mine shaft complex/strip mine/cavern chain because a) it&#39;s really huge and b) i don&#39;t have my waypoint mod installed anymore.

I don&#39;t really remember how far I&#39;m out, but it&#39;s less than 500k and I&#39;m within a few chunks of a nether portal someone else placed, so welp. Griefers please. I want vistors.[/QUOTE]

Ender pearl glitch on top of the roof and then build a nether portal when you want to get down. The problem is that you can&#39;t get directly back to that specific portal. Going back through the portal that you create in the overworld will put you in the nether at a normal location, not back on top.

The best place to gold farm was on top of the nether with piston pushing. Then you&#39;d let things fall into vines so they didnt take falling damage, shove them into a nether portal with pistons (note this cause(s)(d) massive MASSIVE fucking lag), and you&#39;d make a really long water ferry to carry the gold to an uloaded chunk in the overworld. Go afk for 2 hours, and pick up an inventory of nuggets.

Why the complexity? Because you have to stand significantly above the bedrock to instantly despawn mobs below you, and water elevators are obviously non functional in the nether (without source blocks, but idk if you can even place those anymore because of hause&#39;s plugins. I don&#39;t have any anymore to check) You can just use pistons to push stuff into you after it dies, but the drawback is that mobs spawn below you and decrease the effectiveness of your spawner.

Technically you could find a 250x250 chunk of solid nether rock and build something out of that, but chunks that large are extremely rare. I guess you could also find one and use xray to fill it in and make your grinder.

EDIT:

Why would you need so much gold? Because golden carrots and apples are the best food, and with a grinder like that you can easily generate stacks of carrots. Amazingly space efficient for what you get. The new items in 1.5 will make a lot of stuff mentioned above uneeded though. Hoppers let you skip a lot of stuff."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Zephyrs;39859289]Ender pearl glitch on top of the roof and then build a nether portal when you want to get down. The problem is that you can&#39;t get directly back to that specific portal. Going back through the portal that you create in the overworld will put you in the nether at a normal location, not back on top.

The best place to gold farm was on top of the nether with piston pushing. Then you&#39;d let things fall into vines so they didnt take falling damage, shove them into a nether portal with pistons (note this cause(s)(d) massive MASSIVE fucking lag), and you&#39;d make a really long water ferry to carry the gold to an uloaded chunk in the overworld. Go afk for 2 hours, and pick up an inventory of nuggets.

Why the complexity? Because you have to stand significantly above the bedrock to instantly despawn mobs below you, and water elevators are obviously non functional in the nether (without source blocks, but idk if you can even place those anymore because of hause&#39;s plugins. I don&#39;t have any anymore to check) You can just use pistons to push stuff into you after it dies, but the drawback is that mobs spawn below you and decrease the effectiveness of your spawner.

Technically you could find a 250x250 chunk of solid nether rock and build something out of that, but chunks that large are extremely rare. I guess you could also find one and use xray to fill it in and make your grinder.

EDIT:

Why would you need so much gold? Because golden carrots and apples are the best food, and with a grinder like that you can easily generate stacks of carrots. Amazingly space efficient for what you get. The new items in 1.5 will make a lot of stuff mentioned above uneeded though. Hoppers let you skip a lot of stuff.[/QUOTE]
