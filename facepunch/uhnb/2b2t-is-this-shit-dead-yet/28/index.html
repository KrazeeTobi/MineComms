                        <postrender input="So I managed to drown with all my good stuff and I never cared to mark down my coordinates. I didn&#39;t really want to go back there anyways because it was around 15k from spawn and I was looking for a new adventure. I got past all the withers without any trouble and just kept sprinting in one direction. I was hoping for a pig, chicken, or something to kill to keep my hunger off long enough so I could start to get together some basic supplies. I sprinted as long as I could before I went below 3 and I had not seen any animals at all. Soon I was starving to death and I was just walking and watching my inevitable death get closer and closer. I thought to myself how ironic and wonderful it would be to see a pig right as I die, counting off the hearts till the end. Around half health a pig appeared in the distance. I was sure it was just far enough away to let me kill it but die in the process. Walking like my life depended on it I got to business on the pig, killing it with a heart left. The server was lagging just a bit and eating the raw pork didn&#39;t seem to be doing anything at that point so I thought I was fucked, thinking that some update made uncooked meat ineffective. Half a heart stared me in the face as I just gave up on this short life and sat back in my chair. But it stayed. I somehow managed to eat two of the three raw porkchops that pig had dropped saving my life. Still unable to run, I walked my way over to a tree and gave it enough punches for a workbench, shovel, and pickaxe. Soon I was digging into the Earth for stone to make a furnace. I decided to go a block deeper and by the chin hairs of luck I was looking at a nice supply of coal to light up the quickly approaching darkness. I spent the night in a hole and waited for day to break. I emerged hungry again and rose to the top of a hill to look for fresh meat. Instead of livestock I met a pack of creepers and other night folk that would make a well off player be cautious, let alone my unarmored, unarmed, half-heart self. I just about ran but I couldn&#39;t because my hunger was still too high. I dropped back into my hole to cook my lone chop. Without eating that single slice of meat I would have surely died to the tiny hands of one of those new fucking miniature zombies that was now on my ass. I got the fuck out of there and kept pushing forward. A stone sword helped me kill a skeleton along the way to a barely intact piece of farmland with a bunch of ungrown melon stalks and a single patch of green wheat. I didn&#39;t have time to wait on an abundant source of food. I used the bone from the skeleton to mature three stalks hoping one of them would bear a melon soon. One dropped pretty quicly and I used it&#39;s fruit to start healing. I explored the immediately surrounding area while I waited for more to drop. A hole in the ground similar to my own was nearby, except it had a wooden door in it&#39;s dirt door frame. Inside was an empty stone box. I decided this would be my new temp home while I farm a few stacks of melon. Shortly I had quite a few melons spawning every few minutes. During the night I dug down to get a few shafts started for a small strip mining operation to get me enough iron to protect myself. Luckily I dropped right into a cave full of skeletons and creepers. For the creepers I would knock them back far enough so that they would blow while I blocked with the sword eliminating most of their damage. Skeletons would get only a shot or two off before I could kill them. A few exposed spots of iron lay around the cave walls and without going too far I had a helmet, chestplate, and sword. I was now ready to do some serious cave exploring. This first cave system turned out to be a great source of coal, but only netted me three more iron before I had exhausted it&#39;s routes. I looked elsewhere for a more complex system that would hopefully offer a route deep into the crust. Literally the next cave over went quickly down and I was seeing lapis. a handfull of gold was in one room and now I had enough iron for platelegs and boots. Many monsters came along for the journey into the deepest parts of the cave as I looked for diamond. After turning back from a dead end with a tease of redstone I saw my first block of diamond stuck in the ceiling near a lone lava source. Good news was that there wasn&#39;t a lava lake above it. Bad news is there was only one diamond. That&#39;s good enough for me from all the luck I had already exhausted during this unbelievable journey. I made my way back to the surface to start dumping things out of my completely stuffed inventory. I had not expected such an amazing journey to rise from the humiliating drowning I had suffered earlier that day. Whoever thinks this game is boring just hasn&#39;t followed the right path."
