                        <postrender input="Y&#39;know, i&#39;ve been thinking a bit about Redstone and it&#39;s properties (thinking deeply here), and I must say it&#39;s a damn interesting concept for a mineral. It&#39;s a resilient material in it&#39;s naturally-occuring ore-form, yet at the same time it is brittle enough to drop in the form of dust after mining.

As for it&#39;s stranger attributes, it appears to be conductive, piezoelectric and potentially radioactive. The conductivity is kind of obvious, as Redstone Wires can easily carry energy currents produced by Redstone Torches, whereas the piezoelectricity, by which it generates an energy current under pressure, comes from how the Ore glows a bit when it is struck or stepped on, as well as how it responds to Pressure Plates, Stone Buttons, Levers, etc.

The last part, the potential radioactivity, can be attributed to how it glows and whatnot. Tied in with the piezoelectricity, Redstone Dust glows when pressure or a current is applied, emitting both red light and some other energy, perhaps electricity or something similar. However, when crafted into a Redstone Torch, it glows of it&#39;s own volition, and ceases to do so when a current is applied.

How does this work? Does the Redstone react in a certain way when it is crafted with Wood? Is there some sort of energy in the wood of Minecraft trees that is capable of forcing the Redstone into it&#39;s radioactive state (perhaps Minecraftian Trees are magical, like the Hist from The Elder Scrolls), or does the crafting method for Redstone Torches involve high-enough pressures to send it into the same state with a semi-permanent duration? (I always imagine the Redstone part of the Redstone Torch to be some sort of Redstone crystal) I think it is the latter, since Repeater blocks are unpowered by default, although perhaps the Stone has a relative grounding effect.

Regardless, when the Torch is supplied with a current, it is switched off, possibly due to the current having a sort of &quot;stabilising effect&quot; that restores order to the restless &quot;provoked&quot; state of the Redstone Torch. Quite an interesting mechanic if you ask me.

All in all, I find Redstone utterly fascinating, despite my inability and unwillingness to work with it outside of making Watches and Compasses (mostly Watches). And on that note, it brings me to the subject of Watches and Compasses. The Compasses I understand with ease, as the electrical nature of Redstone combined with the magnetic qualities of Iron can easily be interpreted as the Redstone magnetising a sliver of Iron to point towards your apparently-magnetic spawnpoint, which brings me to believe that one&#39;s spawnpoint is a point in time and space that is mysteriously attuned to one&#39;s body and &quot;soul&quot;, and radiates strong magnetic fields for some inscrutable reason.

However, I don&#39;t fully understand what causes Redstone to power a Clock. Perhaps the current reacts with Gold so that the Golden ring inside the Clock slowly rotates around a Redstone Crystal in a clockwise direction, thus turning the clockface it is attached to. There, I think I solved that little mystery by myself.

I know what you&#39;re all thinking, you&#39;re thinking &quot;What is he prattling on about this time?&quot;, &quot;That boy&#39;s thinking too deeply into a video game...&quot;, and &quot;...what&quot;. Maybe I am, but it&#39;s all because of this wonderous and seemingly-magical material. If it actually existed in real-life, it would be one of the most awesome materials known to man, if there aren&#39;t similar materials already, which I highly-doubt there are. Although it might be possible that a combination of strontium-90, an isotope of strontium-90 that is beta-radioactive (it radiates beta particles, high-speed high-energy electrons), and an electrically-conductive metal like gold or platinum, might yield a material with similar attributes, at least the seemingly-spontaneous generation of electrical energy, though the other attributes of Redstone would likely not apply to the Strontium-90+Gold compound, which i&#39;d probably term &quot;strontaurum&quot;, a portmaneau of strontium and aurum, the Latin word for gold. Either that or Redstone in honour of Minecraft Redstone, but only if it&#39;s got a reddish colour.

Someone in the realms of science should attempt to smelt gold and strontium-90, just to see the resulting material. Who knows, might turn out to be pretty valuable, even if it&#39;s not Redstone. Apparently strontium-90&#39;s a by-product of nuclear fission, so nuclear power-plants could potentially be &quot;goldmines&quot; for strontium-90, if there&#39;s enough present in nuclear waste. Come to think of it, there&#39;s quite a bit of strontium-90 in the area  affected by the Chernobyl Incident. Perhaps in the STALKER setting,  throwing gold into an anomaly like a Vortex, Whirligig,  Springboard, etc, would yield something like &quot;strontaurum&quot; or Redstone, although now this is just speculation, so i&#39;ll end that little bit.

Theoretical smithings and strontium-90 aside, Redstone is so mysterious and amazing, and it&#39;s made me think deeply about it. If the real-world had anything with Redstone&#39;s properties, it&#39;d be pretty damn revolutionary. But what i&#39;m wondering is how it forms in Minecraft. Is it simply a fusion of gold and other heavy elements deep underground, or is it something more &quot;magical&quot;, like the spilt blood of eldritch abominations that once roamed Minecraftia but were eventually wiped out by ancient Pigman tribes? I guess we won&#39;t know for a long time, unless Mojang decides to actually add some sort of lore to Minecraft.

To sum up, pseudoscience of Redstone, attempted rationalisation of it&#39;s strange properties, speculation of what it could be, a waste of 2 hours on my part, but only a few minutes on yours, moreso if you actually read it all."

(I always imagine the Redstone part of the Redstone Torch to be some sort of Redstone crystal) I think it is the latter, since Repeater blocks are unpowered by default, although perhaps the Stone has a relative grounding effect.

Regardless, when the Torch is supplied with a current, it is switched off, possibly due to the current having a sort of &quot;stabilising effect&quot; that restores order to the restless &quot;provoked&quot; state of the Redstone Torch. Quite an interesting mechanic if you ask me.

All in all, I find Redstone utterly fascinating, despite my inability and unwillingness to work with it outside of making Watches and Compasses (mostly Watches). And on that note, it brings me to the subject of Watches and Compasses. The Compasses I understand with ease, as the electrical nature of Redstone combined with the magnetic qualities of Iron can easily be interpreted as the Redstone magnetising a sliver of Iron to point towards your apparently-magnetic spawnpoint, which brings me to believe that one&#39;s spawnpoint is a point in time and space that is mysteriously attuned to one&#39;s body and &quot;soul&quot;, and radiates strong magnetic fields for some inscrutable reason.

However, I don&#39;t fully understand what causes Redstone to power a Clock. Perhaps the current reacts with Gold so that the Golden ring inside the Clock slowly rotates around a Redstone Crystal in a clockwise direction, thus turning the clockface it is attached to. There, I think I solved that little mystery by myself.

I know what you&#39;re all thinking, you&#39;re thinking &quot;What is he prattling on about this time?&quot;, &quot;That boy&#39;s thinking too deeply into a video game...&quot;, and &quot;...what&quot;. Maybe I am, but it&#39;s all because of this wonderous and seemingly-magical material. If it actually existed in real-life, it would be one of the most awesome materials known to man, if there aren&#39;t similar materials already, which I highly-doubt there are. Although it might be possible that a combination of strontium-90, an isotope of strontium-90 that is beta-radioactive (it radiates beta particles, high-speed high-energy electrons), and an electrically-conductive metal like gold or platinum, might yield a material with similar attributes, at least the seemingly-spontaneous generation of electrical energy, though the other attributes of Redstone would likely not apply to the Strontium-90+Gold compound, which i&#39;d probably term &quot;strontaurum&quot;, a portmaneau of strontium and aurum, the Latin word for gold. Either that or Redstone in honour of Minecraft Redstone, but only if it&#39;s got a reddish colour.

Someone in the realms of science should attempt to smelt gold and strontium-90, just to see the resulting material. Who knows, might turn out to be pretty valuable, even if it&#39;s not Redstone. Apparently strontium-90&#39;s a by-product of nuclear fission, so nuclear power-plants could potentially be &quot;goldmines&quot; for strontium-90, if there&#39;s enough present in nuclear waste. Come to think of it, there&#39;s quite a bit of strontium-90 in the area  affected by the Chernobyl Incident. Perhaps in the STALKER setting,  throwing gold into an anomaly like a Vortex, Whirligig,  Springboard, etc, would yield something like &quot;strontaurum&quot; or Redstone, although now this is just speculation, so i&#39;ll end that little bit.

Theoretical smithings and strontium-90 aside, Redstone is so mysterious and amazing, and it&#39;s made me think deeply about it. If the real-world had anything with Redstone&#39;s properties, it&#39;d be pretty damn revolutionary. But what i&#39;m wondering is how it forms in Minecraft. Is it simply a fusion of gold and other heavy elements deep underground, or is it something more &quot;magical&quot;, like the spilt blood of eldritch abominations that once roamed Minecraftia but were eventually wiped out by ancient Pigman tribes? I guess we won&#39;t know for a long time, unless Mojang decides to actually add some sort of lore to Minecraft.

To sum up, pseudoscience of Redstone, attempted rationalisation of it&#39;s strange properties, speculation of what it could be, a waste of 2 hours on my part, but only a few minutes on yours, moreso if you actually read it all.</span>

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=ironman17;28423926]Y&#39;know, i&#39;ve been thinking a bit about Redstone and it&#39;s properties (thinking deeply here), and I must say it&#39;s a damn interesting concept for a mineral. It&#39;s a resilient material in it&#39;s naturally-occuring ore-form, yet at the same time it is brittle enough to drop in the form of dust after mining.

As for it&#39;s stranger attributes, it appears to be conductive, piezoelectric and potentially radioactive. The conductivity is kind of obvious, as Redstone Wires can easily carry energy currents produced by Redstone Torches, whereas the piezoelectricity, by which it generates an energy current under pressure, comes from how the Ore glows a bit when it is struck or stepped on, as well as how it responds to Pressure Plates, Stone Buttons, Levers, etc.

The last part, the potential radioactivity, can be attributed to how it glows and whatnot. Tied in with the piezoelectricity, Redstone Dust glows when pressure or a current is applied, emitting both red light and some other energy, perhaps electricity or something similar. However, when crafted into a Redstone Torch, it glows of it&#39;s own volition, and ceases to do so when a current is applied.

How does this work? Does the Redstone react in a certain way when it is crafted with Wood? Is there some sort of energy in the wood of Minecraft trees that is capable of forcing the Redstone into it&#39;s radioactive state (perhaps Minecraftian Trees are magical, like the Hist from The Elder Scrolls), or does the crafting method for Redstone Torches involve high-enough pressures to send it into the same state with a semi-permanent duration?
