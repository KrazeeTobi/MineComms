Also if you use it, be careful about ghosting into blocks with the pig stack, it&#39;ll kill the pigs or yourself.

Upon further testing, ghosting into tree leaves will not kill the pigs or yourself."

[u]Holy Water:[/u]

Diamonds, when smelted, turn into Holy Water, which was a bright, physically lighted liquid that acts as water, but is very bright and beautiful, healing anyone or anything stepping into it.

The brightness would be more than lava, and the healing would take place as fast as if one was on peaceful. The liquid would have a very, very rare chance of being found underground. Any dirt near the water will turn into green grass. Any zombie or skeleton will not go near the water if possible, but if pushed in, will die slowly. (Mob trap, possibly?) Grass near it would have an increased spawn rate for all creatures, but the simple fact that the light emitted is bright, only peaceful mobs will spawn nearby.

It would have particles floating up from it, and when rushing, had a sort of &quot;magical&quot; sound like water, but more peaceful and with some soft chimes thrown in.
[u]Oil[/u]

Oil would be a rare find underground, but very interesting. It flows like water and lava, but a bit faster than water. When this touches lava or any fire, it will immediately burst into flames, replacing all oil blocks with fire. The source block will explode like normal TNT.

When put in a bucket, this will give furnaces 50 blocks of smelting power. The sound would be like normal water.

[u]Sludge[/u]

This is a liquid that everyone will hate immensely. The bucket will pick it up, but will stay bonded to this vile fluid unless lava is put into it, destroying the sludge. Sludge makes you sink into it slowly, but mashing the space bar extremely fast will bring you above the top, letting you not suffocate. Slimes will spawn from this fluid, and cannot sink into it. All healing stops when you are inside it, so peaceful mode will not do anything to heal you while inside it, and eating will give you no health.

Sludge flows at an extremely slow pace, slower by two times than lava.

The flowing sounds would be like boiling sludge.

[u]Gas[/u]

Not really a fluid, but has the properties of it except one thing: It flows and floats upward instead of downward. It is a pale purple and suffocates you, as well as being extremely flammable, causing a considerable explosion. When this gas floats more than 10 blocks upward without stopping, it disappears. It can be captured in a bucket like any normal liquid, and functions the same way. When a bucket of this is put in a furnace, it does something special: It takes up the bottom slot for about thirty seconds, enabling it to be taken out, but after that thirty seconds the furnace explodes, allowing for timed explosives.

More ores!
-Sulferstone, which is a pale brown version of a block, that when hit, starts a countdown of three seconds before it explodes! It&#39;s like a creeper inside the wall! Beware when strip mining from now on! When this explodes, it leaves one or two sulfur behind.
-Crystal: Totally not diamond. This is a quartz like material that makes up certain parts of caves, much like a small crystal cave of sorts. It takes a bit longer to mine than stone, but can create tools that are a step between iron and stone. Armor made from this has the chance to reflect arrows and negate all damage done by them, as well as giving you protection from lava (both wear the suit down), but it does not prevent any damage other than the two later. Each block drops 3 crystal, and these can be combined into blocks when made into a 2x2 shape.
Lavastone: A blackish stone with a rough texture that is frequently near lava. This material is a pain to step on, and deals damage much like cactus without having to be on sand or not surrounded by something.

New mobs!
-Lava Slimes: Spawn in lava and jump very far, dealing fire damage to anything it hits. These slimes will attack other creatures other than slimes as well, and are quite weak. These drop lavastone.
-Shadows: Truly the monsters of your nightmares. These only spawn in the darkest places, and have two red eyes. They will stare you down from the darkness and hide behind ledges and corners, waiting for you to come near to attack. When they find you and attack from a hiding place, they will immediately teleport to an area behind you after the hit and repeat. These are quite weak and sunlight will burn them immediately, as well as a well-placed diamond sword. These monsters do not drop anything, but when killed, disappear on the spot.
-Dark Slimes are much like regular slimes, but will travel faster and hit harder the darker the place is. In complete darkness these are invincible, while in sunlight, they will break up and dissipate.
-Lashers are small 2x1 lizards that hide in holes in the walls and lash at you with their tongue, doing damage once when it hits you, and hits you a couple more times when it chomps on you after pulling you in. Once hit, they will let go, but eventually attack again.
-Crystal Lizards are small 2x1 creatures that are quite friendly, but when attacked, shoot bits of crystal from its mouth, dealing half a heart of damage per hit. They also function in a group mechanic, so when you attack one, they all will attack you. Be warned, the recoil on these crystals is the worst part, knocking you into lava or completely disorienting you. They drop crystals."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Chezhead;28286520]Idea: CAVE EXPANSION PACK

More ores!
-Sulferstone, which is a pale brown version of a block, that when hit, starts a countdown of three seconds before it explodes! It&#39;s like a creeper inside the wall! Beware when strip mining from now on! When this explodes, it leaves one or two sulfur behind.
-Crystal: Totally not diamond. This is a quartz like material that makes up certain parts of caves, much like a small crystal cave of sorts. It takes a bit longer to mine than stone, but can create tools that are a step between iron and stone. Armor made from this has the chance to reflect arrows and negate all damage done by them, as well as giving you protection from lava (both wear the suit down), but it does not prevent any damage other than the two later. Each block drops 3 crystal, and these can be combined into blocks when made into a 2x2 shape.
Lavastone: A blackish stone with a rough texture that is frequently near lava. This material is a pain to step on, and deals damage much like cactus without having to be on sand or not surrounded by something.

New mobs!
-Lava Slimes: Spawn in lava and jump very far, dealing fire damage to anything it hits. These slimes will attack other creatures other than slimes as well, and are quite weak. These drop lavastone.
-Shadows: Truly the monsters of your nightmares. These only spawn in the darkest places, and have two red eyes. They will stare you down from the darkness and hide behind ledges and corners, waiting for you to come near to attack. When they find you and attack from a hiding place, they will immediately teleport to an area behind you after the hit and repeat. These are quite weak and sunlight will burn them immediately, as well as a well-placed diamond sword. These monsters do not drop anything, but when killed, disappear on the spot.
-Dark Slimes are much like regular slimes, but will travel faster and hit harder the darker the place is. In complete darkness these are invincible, while in sunlight, they will break up and dissipate.
-Lashers are small 2x1 lizards that hide in holes in the walls and lash at you with their tongue, doing damage once when it hits you, and hits you a couple more times when it chomps on you after pulling you in. Once hit, they will let go, but eventually attack again.
-Crystal Lizards are small 2x1 creatures that are quite friendly, but when attacked, shoot bits of crystal from its mouth, dealing half a heart of damage per hit. They also function in a group mechanic, so when you attack one, they all will attack you. Be warned, the recoil on these crystals is the worst part, knocking you into lava or completely disorienting you. They drop crystals.[/QUOTE]
 
I may try the Lavastone if you make a texture.</span>
