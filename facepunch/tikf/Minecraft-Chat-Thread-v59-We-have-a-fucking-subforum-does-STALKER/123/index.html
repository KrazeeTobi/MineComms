I could go on about his statement about &quot;all you do is place blocks and build things&quot;,

All you do in Call of Duty is shoot things
All you do in Portal is jump and shoot portals
All you do in Half-life is shoot things
All you do in Mario is jump on things and run
All you do in Mass Effect is shoot people and talk
All you do with music is listen to it
All you do with life is living it"

Take that square building, cut the side edges off. After that, cut the top edges off too. It looks like a hut in a way, but saves resources and looks better.

Try and make buildings to scale, for example take a picture like this

[img]http://www.atlantaplansource.com/uploaded_images/A2021-Small-Color-Rendering-796129.jpg[/img]

And make it to scale, that one looks pretty simple to do in fact.

For things like the window at the very top, don&#39;t worry about making it round, use a single glass block.

And for the back, use your imagination or try and make a good guess, because chances are the front may repeat in the back."
