Thanks and I get your thinking and I actually figured you had this mindset. Its silly though only because doing that would double the amount of memory needed for any given chunk. A chunk&#39;s definition is a 16x16 block that spans the [b]maximum[/b] vertical distance (in this case 128). In the second pane the maximum vertical distance would be 128*2=256 which would effectively double the chunk size. So what the guy that propositioned that image is saying is that Notch should double the vertical distance (and thus the map memory) so we can have higher mountains. He demonstrates a flawed understand of how the chunk system works.

Its useless to say &quot;it still respects the 128 block height limit&quot; because it actually doesn&#39;t. Its completely changing the maximum allowed height to 256 because a chunk spans the entire vertical distance (aka no stacking two chunks on top of each other). Which means a chunk is now 256 units instead of the maximum 128. Bedrock is still a block that has to be stored in data.

Point is, more room = more memory. The easiest way to raise the roof (:v:) would be to make the height 256."

You see it loads an extra chunk under it as plain bedrock, keeping the 128 limit for the chunks, but making it bigger at the same time. It just offsets everything and makes stuff confusing just like what I&#39;m typing right now.[/QUOTE]
 
Thanks and I get your thinking and I actually figured you had this mindset. Its silly though only because doing that would double the amount of memory needed for any given chunk. A chunk&#39;s definition is a 16x16 block that spans the [b]maximum[/b] vertical distance (in this case 128). In the second pane the maximum vertical distance would be 128*2=256 which would effectively double the chunk size. So what the guy that propositioned that image is saying is that Notch should double the vertical distance (and thus the map memory) so we can have higher mountains. He demonstrates a flawed understand of how the chunk system works.

Its useless to say &quot;it still respects the 128 block height limit&quot; because it actually doesn&#39;t. Its completely changing the maximum allowed height to 256 because a chunk spans the entire vertical distance (aka no stacking two chunks on top of each other). Which means a chunk is now 256 units instead of the maximum 128. Bedrock is still a block that has to be stored in data.

Point is, more room = more memory. The easiest way to raise the roof (:v:) would be to make the height 256.</span>

I see what you&#39;re getting at. That would just require a variable to offset the chunk. With Flak&#39;s explaination I thought you were allowed to build in the space above those little rectangles. Doesn&#39;t that sound silly though? Some buildings would be higher than others. Say I wanted to build a bridge across two moutains (not to mention building a subway would be a nightmare). I couldn&#39;t because there are suddenly horizontal limits. I figured this might be what the picture meant but I didn&#39;t see how that would be reasonable.

The only reasonable way to have taller mountains would be to either increase the vertical distance or lower sea level which would make the underground smaller."

You can have top block at maximum height and next block could be located in another chunk but go higher because it&#39;s another chunk, but you wouldn&#39;t be able to build back to old chunk from new chunk at higher altitude. Does this make sense to you? I&#39;m not that good at explaining with words.

Bedrock isn&#39;t stored besides the first layer.

Also, check yMod, it changes MAXIMUM vertical distance on the fly.

I see what you&#39;re getting at. That would just require a variable to offset the chunk. With Flak&#39;s explaination I thought you were allowed to build in the space above those little rectangles. Doesn&#39;t that sound silly though? Some buildings would be higher than others. Say I wanted to build a bridge across two moutains (not to mention building a subway would be a nightmare). I couldn&#39;t because there are suddenly horizontal limits. I figured this might be what the picture meant but I didn&#39;t see how that would be reasonable.

The only reasonable way to have taller mountains would be to either increase the vertical distance or lower sea level which would make the underground smaller.</span>

If it had to translate x and y positions then that&#39;d be a huge nightmare (I&#39;m not sure that minecraft saves blocks relative to the chunk&#39;s origin, it might, funny I wrote a parser for the old MC file format, you&#39;d think I&#39;d know this).

You see it loads an extra chunk under it as plain bedrock, keeping the 128 limit for the chunks, but making it bigger at the same time. It just offsets everything and makes stuff confusing just like what I&#39;m typing right now.[/QUOTE]

Instant petrified world. It would be really cool as dirt would actually be hard to find, and it would look like a barren wasteland.
