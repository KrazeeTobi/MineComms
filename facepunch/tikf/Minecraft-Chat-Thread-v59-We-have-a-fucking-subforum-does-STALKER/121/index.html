[b]What is NationCraft?[/b]

It&#39;s a unique RP server that is currently in a testing phase. The story of NationCraft pits three distinct factions with their own culture and architecture against each other in a vast and compelling storyline created by the NationCraft staff. This story unfolds through weekly events organised and moderated by our team.

We firmly believe that YOU should have a say in what happens. Not only in the story (allowing you to suggest events that will shape the entire story arc) but also in the developmental process, which is completely transparent and available for access.


[b]Backstory[/b]

The skies were overcast, and the mood was foul. For the nations under the king, their world was about to be irrevocably changed.

Governer Sichar, Prince Gabriel and General Belial stood at the bottom of the palace steps, awaiting the inevitable. The King had been fighting disease for months, but now he was drawing his final breath.

Sichar shot a sideways glance to the Prince. &#39;This petulant child thinks he is fit to take the throne? I&#39;ve been the ruling body over the townspeople and chief advisor to the king since before he knew how to use the toilet!&#39;

Prince Gabriel glared at the General, &#39;How dare he think he can rule! This is my birth right, I&#39;m not about to pass it off to some glorified thug with a foul attitude.&#39;

Belial looked disapprovingly upon the Governer. &#39;This man is soft, he doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s best for the people, the people don&#39;t know what&#39;s best either! Military rule is the only thing that can save the nation, so that we may become an empire once again.&#39;

The silence was shattered as the king&#39;s nurse descended the stairs. &quot;In God&#39;s name,&quot; she proclaimed, &quot;The King is dead.&quot; The three men looked to her, then looked to each other and nodded. They each turned their backs on each other and left to find their respective manifesto.

As the hours turned into days, and the days turned into weeks, a decision still could not be made on who should gain control of the kingdom. The underclasses were becoming restless and the entire nation was under threat of splitting apart. Prince Gabriel wanted things to return to how they were under the old king&#39;s rule, all would be cared for and all men would be able to live under a roof together as equal. Sichar wanted to progress his nation immediately, the weak would be treated as such, granted lesser accomodation and allowed meager food rations, whereas the mighty would benefit greatly if they could prove their excellence.

General Belial saw problems with both of these plans, instead plotting to establish a new form of law amongst the people. By heavily regimenting the actions and activities of the people he will grant their loyalty and trust. It would be a perfect plan to reduce crime and increase efficiency, yet for some reason Gabriel and Sichar took offence to it.

The kingdom was on the verge of civil war, and with no ruler the three leaders assumed control of their own various provinces and began mounting their forces. As he was the rightful heir to the throne, Prince Gabriel was granted the lush green hills and valleys of the Westerlund province, fertile as they were with trees, natural crops and wildlife. The Governer called the Svendich province his home. At first glance it was a hostile environment, almost entirely blanketed in snow, but below the frigid surface a vast variety of natural resources could be found.

The General was not so lucky with his province, the Ester regions were barren and treacherous with lava flows and sharp jagged rocks coating the landscape. Although it lacked the basic raw materials for growth and culture, Belial couldn&#39;t help but smile at his glorious nation, even walking from one&#39;s bedroom to the town hall would be considered an exercise. &quot;We&#39;ll make an army of you yet&quot; he said to himself, &quot;Just you see&quot;.
