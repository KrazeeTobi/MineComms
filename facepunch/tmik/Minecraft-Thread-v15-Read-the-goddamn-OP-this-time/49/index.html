[I]New Plymouth:
[/I]1867: Colonists from the motherland arrive in the New World. There are very few of them, on this first ship, numbering approximately ten. The first building that is built on order of the King is the Royal Port Authority. This way, the motherland can have a degree of control over the residents of the colony. A dock is added on soon after.

A few days later, Ninja Wilko, a skilled carpenter, sets up shop in the town. His job is to provide tools and supplies for the colonists to use, critical for expanding and maintaning the colony. Using Wilko&#39;s tools. The Royal Port Authority, headed by Jacob Culvern, authorizes the construction of Hillfront Mine, which remained un-haunted until two pigs were found deep in its main shaft later that month. Closely following the completion of the mine, traders from the motherland open the New Plymouth Trading Co., hoping to take a share of the intercontinental trade that the Port Authority so far had the monopoly over.

New Plymouth continues to grow. More homes are built daily, and the services of the blacksmith, Demonguard, are required fairly often.
--
When the first colonists arrived to New Plymouth, along with them came a man and his three sons: John Swampsen. Back in the motherland, his father owned a succesful lumbermill, and there was much pressure on him to do the same in the New World. Setting off into the wilderness, he formed John&#39;s Logging, Ltd. in the middle of a dense forest.

Soon, more workers were attractred to the camp, as the pay was well and pigs plentiful. A manufactory was opened close to the main camp in order to better supply the workers. After the camp gained its first resident, Pandemix, it was officialy recognized as the town of West Creek by the New Plymouth Royal Port Authority. Recently, however, John has pursued a more troubling path. Attempting to reduce tariffs by sending his products to the New Plymouth Trading Co., the motherland has become worried of West Creek&#39;s independant sentiment. To create further ties with West Creek,a road had been built between them and the area it encompassed dubbed the &quot;District of Hinterland&quot;. 

After John&#39;s policies did not change following the completion of the Road, the Port Authority has greatly restricted the rights of West Creek. After the value of logs and planks plumetted due to an exceptionally strong growing season overseas, growth of West Creek had squalled, permitting the Port Authority to downgrade the Town to a District and ban all trade through the New Plymouth Trading Co.

It&#39;s a way of tiding us over until MP comes out, but I&#39;d prefer if we kepts our maps separate. Also, since I have nothing better to do, story time.

[I]New Plymouth:
[/I]1867: Colonists from the motherland arrive in the New World. There are very few of them, on this first ship, numbering approximately ten. The first building that is built on order of the King is the Royal Port Authority. This way, the motherland can have a degree of control over the residents of the colony. A dock is added on soon after.

A few days later, Ninja Wilko, a skilled carpenter, sets up shop in the town. His job is to provide tools and supplies for the colonists to use, critical for expanding and maintaning the colony. Using Wilko&#39;s tools. The Royal Port Authority, headed by Jacob Culvern, authorizes the construction of Hillfront Mine, which remained un-haunted until two pigs were found deep in its main shaft later that month. Closely following the completion of the mine, traders from the motherland open the New Plymouth Trading Co., hoping to take a share of the intercontinental trade that the Port Authority so far had the monopoly over.

New Plymouth continues to grow. More homes are built daily, and the services of the blacksmith, Demonguard, are required fairly often.
--
When the first colonists arrived to New Plymouth, along with them came a man and his three sons: John Swampsen. Back in the motherland, his father owned a succesful lumbermill, and there was much pressure on him to do the same in the New World. Setting off into the wilderness, he formed John&#39;s Logging, Ltd. in the middle of a dense forest.

Soon, more workers were attractred to the camp, as the pay was well and pigs plentiful. A manufactory was opened close to the main camp in order to better supply the workers. After the camp gained its first resident, Pandemix, it was officialy recognized as the town of West Creek by the New Plymouth Royal Port Authority. Recently, however, John has pursued a more troubling path. Attempting to reduce tariffs by sending his products to the New Plymouth Trading Co., the motherland has become worried of West Creek&#39;s independant sentiment. To create further ties with West Creek,a road had been built between them and the area it encompassed dubbed the &quot;District of Hinterland&quot;. 

After John&#39;s policies did not change following the completion of the Road, the Port Authority has greatly restricted the rights of West Creek. After the value of logs and planks plumetted due to an exceptionally strong growing season overseas, growth of West Creek had squalled, permitting the Port Authority to downgrade the Town to a District and ban all trade through the New Plymouth Trading Co.

To be honest I really don&#39;t understand the &quot;Okay I&#39;ll be a farmer&quot; and then some other guy saids &quot;Okay I&#39;ll be the lumberjack&quot;, when people can do everything themselves with ease.
I mean in Wurm online, there&#39;s a point to that, as the jobs are a lot harder. But in Minecraft, someone could clearcut a forest and get a shitload of wood, make a farm, finish a good sized base, and do quite a bit of cave exploring and mining in the time it would take a average wurm player to just make a small house.
I apologize if I offended anyone, I was just saying what I thought.

I don&#39;t mind it, but it&#39;s a little weird. OMG TODAY IM FARMER AND IM GOING TO FARM THINGS. OOh look at my pretty little hoose i have a bed and a tv and a hot lol its so cozy I made windows too

Again, I think this is fun, but I don&#39;t think he does.[/QUOTE]
To be honest I really don&#39;t understand the &quot;Okay I&#39;ll be a farmer&quot; and then some other guy saids &quot;Okay I&#39;ll be the lumberjack&quot;, when people can do everything themselves with ease.
I mean in Wurm online, there&#39;s a point to that, as the jobs are a lot harder. But in Minecraft, someone could clearcut a forest and get a shitload of wood, make a farm, finish a good sized base, and do quite a bit of cave exploring and mining in the time it would take a average wurm player to just make a small house.
I apologize if I offended anyone, I was just saying what I thought.

Minerals for me are a lot more plentiful from spelunking than mining. Also, I prefer just exploring the caves around my main base as I can just expand into them later on.

Also image dump of my walkway and docks. Sorry for the FPS counters. I really want to make my walkway into a railway someday.
