    Notch, creator of minecraft, has been making a lot of progress lately on his virtual digging simulator. Just this morning I found myself lost in the randomly generated caves for hours. He&amp;#8217;s done a great job so far.

    Let&amp;#8217;s hope the upcoming multiplayer experience is as great as it should be!

    Good luck, Notch!

He walked down the dirt staircase and approached the center of his small fort, he took his time placing the dynamite, he was in no rush.

Famasfan placed the dynamite around him in a trisector. Him standing in the middle. Famasfans intentions were clear: if he was going down, which he was, he was going to take as many as he could with them. The wall shudered and then burst open revealing the mass of twisted entities rushing towards him. Mini-bricks flying everywhere.

 He only had one heart left anyway, the fall damage had taken its toll.

The dynamite detonated, the creeprince and its horrid horde would die.

 An old survival vet dies, a young noob lives, fair trade. The creeprince fell to the ground and flickered three times. He watched as the creeprince disappeared, he smiled. letting the tear roll down his face unashamedly.

I hope notch makes a VERSUS. Start on premade saves, one minute days and up to five minute nights. Half the players are the humans, the others are the mobs. Players rebuild in the daytime part, if they&#39;re still alive (No respawning.) Unable to build at night, during the seige where the mobs can spawn. When the survivors are finished, team switch.

Good?"

                            <span v-pre>[b]Guys, I had a gamemode idea.[/b]

I hope notch makes a VERSUS. Start on premade saves, one minute days and up to five minute nights. Half the players are the humans, the others are the mobs. Players rebuild in the daytime part, if they&#39;re still alive (No respawning.) Unable to build at night, during the seige where the mobs can spawn. When the survivors are finished, team switch.

Good?</span>

[i]Famasfan sighed, it would be over soon. His fort had lasted many game days but soon it would perish. He stood upon his stone balcony looking down at the mass of creepers and clattershots. The fort Famasfan had built was a nice beach side fort built mainly from stone. He walked down the dirt staircase and approached the center of his small fort, he took his time placing the dynamite, he was in no rush.

 Through the one block whole in the wall he could see a creeprince approaching its fearsome face smeared with the 8-bit blood of fresh noobs trying out survival. Famasfan placed the dynamite around him in a trisector. Him standing in the middle. Famasfans intentions were clear: if he was going down, which he was, he was going to take as many as he could with them. The wall shudered and then burst open revealing the mass of twisted entities rushing towards him. Mini-bricks flying everywhere.

 He only had one heart left anyway, the fall damage had taken its toll. He lifted his left finger, crying to himself as he did, Famasfan left clicked and as he watched that 8-bit fuse run down he felt relief. The relief of no more pain. The dynamite detonated, the creeprince and its horrid horde would die.

 An old survival vet dies, a young noob lives, fair trade. The creeprince fell to the ground and flickered three times. He watched as the creeprince disappeared, he smiled. letting the tear roll down his face unashamedly.
