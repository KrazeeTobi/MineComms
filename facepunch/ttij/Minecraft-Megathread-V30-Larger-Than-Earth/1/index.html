[release]+ [URL=&quot;http://notch.tumblr.com/&quot;]Notch&#39;s Blog![/URL]  sssSsSSsssSecret friday updates galore!
+ [URL=&quot;http://twitter.com/xnotch&quot;]Notch&#39;s Twitter![/URL]
Notch is quite active on twitter, and will sometimes &quot;leak&quot; info about the new updates in replies and such!
+ [URL=&quot;http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=1c111&quot;]Notch&#39;s Google Moderator Page![/URL]
Notch has had many ways of seeing suggestions and answering them, weather it be forumspring, the MC forums, or this, but this seems to be a good way for him to see good ideas.

[B]Past updates:[/B]

[B]Update #1[/B]
Minecarts + Tracks!
UPDATE: You can now ride minecarts! (But you can no longer store things  in them)

[B]Update #2[/B]
Treasure rooms made of mossy cobblestone. Contain:

Chests full of treasure, including saddles, which you can use to ride  pigs.
Mob spawners, which spawn enemies. When you pick them up, placing  them again causes them to spawn pigs. EDIT: For some reason, you  can&#39;t pick them up any more.

[B]Update #3[/B]
 [URL=&quot;http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6741/sfu3byoctopie.png&quot;][IMG_thumb]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6741/sfu3byoctopie.png[/IMG_thumb][/URL]

[B]Update #4[/B]
Snow and Ice!   
Each time you generate a new world, there&#39;s a chance that it&#39;ll be  snowing! Lakes will be covered in ice, and snowflakes will clutter your  vision.

[B]Update #4.1[/B]
Snowballs!
You gain snowballs from breaking snow, which can be used to craft snow blocks.
Plus various bug fixes.

[b]Update $5[/b]
BOATS!!
You can now construct boats, and random large trees, and cacti, now spawn.
Snowballs can stack to 16, and you only need 4 to create a snowblock, and animals only spawn on grass.

[b]Update #5.1[/b]
The stuttering and death big has been fixed! You can now play on a difficulty again with out the worry of losing your save!
Leaves now decay again, boats only crash when going above a certain speed, and they turn much nicer.

[b]Update #5.1.1[/b]
Levels &quot;load better&quot; now.

[b]Update #6[/b]
There are cows, and they drop leather. The leather is now used to make leather armor and cloth will soon be used to make robes instead as notch said. Cows will also soon be able to give milk, but it does not work yet.

[b]Notch&#39;s Plans![/b]
From his Brocraft Stream on July 14.
Thanks to Chezhead
[code]
- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- Boxers, not briefs.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- Kill notch, get an apple. You can make this into a golden apple.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug in this update.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Notch dies in lava really fast.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Notch has Hedgehog a name? Sparkles.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Notch gets suprise-attacked by a monster.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Mineville. It&#39;s going to happen.
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Gayb- I mean, Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Notch has seen the facebooks and the twitters.
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- 1000 livestream viewers! 
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Notch finds Gabe Newel attractive and admits his furry fandom
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- He doesn&#39;t smoke weed &quot;right now&quot; and tells us that drugs are bad.
- Rana is gone forever
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- *Gabe Newel Fat joke*
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- &quot;[Hedgehogs] could be a good idea! It hurts if you step on it.&quot;
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.

QUESTION TIME

Is notch a martial arts master? Nope.
TF2 is this favorite European war-themed hat simulator.
Notch has a fedora. A really expensive one.
He did not expect to be still working on it or for it to be this big.
Notch thinks that shared accounts are good for advertisement, but doesn&#39;t like them much.

- Leather armor would be what cloth armor is now, and cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- If a nun and a midget walk into a bar, what happens?&quot; &quot;Probably a punch line.&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Notch loves achievements.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.
- Notch is going to end the stream, and show us some multiplayer footage! It&#39;s jsut going to be the bare bones, but a development none-the-less.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
-Erp, the server crashed. It looks like water isn&#39;t working. He thinks that a player got attacked by a monster and died, thus crashing the server.
- Oohh! The SMP server he has is infinite! He says he will be starting with the hard stuff first...
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP! (Editor&#39;s note - my town can be used!)
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits!

And thats a wrap!

[B]Minecraft[/B]

Minecraft is a single and multi player game based on placing and  destroying blocks of different materials. It was based on another game,  infiniminer, but with various changes and improvements the game has  really grown and continues to expand on the ideas of infiniminer.
It began its life on May 10, 2009, at the hands of Markus Persson (Also known as Notch, sexy, bald and swedish) It&#39;s currently free to play Minecraft Classic but to play &quot;/game/&quot; you have to pay:

+ 9.95 Euros
+ &#163;8.53 (as of 31/06/10)
+ ~$12-13

via PayPal. The price will double (it is currently half price) when the  game reaches beta stage. 

[B]Classic:[/B]

[b]Minecraft keeps randomly stuttering and freezing, and I can&#39;t respawn. How do I fix it?[/b]
Open your save&#39;s level.dat with NBTedit, and set the player&#39;s health to 20, and deathtime to 0.

[B]Minecraft crashes and I get an error. What do I do?[/B]
Have you tried uninstalling/re-installing java? Have you updated java?  Have you deleted minecraft.jar and ran the client to re-download it? Try  these before you ask in the thread.

If nobody knows, have you e-mailed Notch?

E-mail all error reports to [EMAIL=&quot;support@mojang.com&quot;]support@mojang.com[/EMAIL]

[B]How do I buy minecraft?[/B]
[highlight]YOU NEED PAYPAL TO PURCHASE MINECRAFT.[/highlight]
Head over to [URL=&quot;http://www.minecraft.net/&quot;]www.minecraft.net[/URL],  register an account, click the &quot;buy now&quot; link at the top right.
Should be self explanatory from there.
You can also purchase minecraft for a friend, by selecting &quot;purchase as  gift&quot;.

[B]Minecraft doesn&#39;t have all the cool stuff I see in the screenshots,  like tools and bacon and creepers![/B]
You need to purchase the game to use these features. Once you have  bought the game, head on over to [URL]http://minecraft.net/game/[/URL] to play! Or  alternatively, download the client from [URL]http://minecraft.net/download.jsp[/URL]

[B]How do I access /game/?[/B]
[URL]http://minecraft.net/game/[/URL]
[URL]http://minecraft.net/download.jsp[/URL]

[B]How do I use custom texture packs?[/B]

#1: Download the texture pack. It should be in a .rar file.
#2: Open the texture pack in WinRAR.
#3: Go to %appdata%\.minecraft\bin\ and right click minecraft.jar --&gt;  open with --&gt; WinRAR
#4: The files in the texture pack should be in a structure with  terrain.png in the root folder (it should be visible when you open the  .rar) and folders such as armor, mobs etc.
#5: If #4 is true, Drag/Drop the texture files from the pack to  minecraft.jar (open in winRAR)
#6: Run minecraft!

NOTE: Your textures will be wiped if Notch updates terrain.png, so be  prepared to re-install packs often.

[B]I have installed a texture pack - some objects are pink/do not appear  at all[/B]

Your texture pack is not up to date. Wait for the creator to post the  latest version.
Alternatively, create the new textures yourself (edit terrain.png and  the other files)

[B]How do I create my own texture pack?[/B] (Thanks to DeanWinchester  for this answer!)
1. Get WinRAR
2. Go to &quot;%appdata%\.minecraft\bin\minecraft.jar&quot;
3. Open &quot;minecraft.jar&quot; with WinRAR
4. Create a folder somewhere called &quot;Minecraft Textures&quot;
5. Extract all png/gif files in there, as well as the folders:
&quot;armor&quot;
&quot;art&quot;
&quot;gui&quot;
&quot;item&quot;
&quot;misc&quot;
&quot;mob&quot;
&quot;terrain&quot;

to the folder you created.
6. Edit them and save.
7. Drag and drop everything from your &quot;Minecraft Textures&quot; folder back  into the jar file that is opened with WinRAR (following the same folder  structure) and let them replace the others.
8. Play and enjoy :D

[B]Will you buy minecraft for me?[/B]
No.
Some users run competitions, enter those.
Also, if you are willing to offer something in return, e.g. a game of  equivalent price, (because you can&#39;t use paypal for some reason) then  feel free to ask.
If you do beg (asking more than once), you are likely to be shunned. You  have been warned.


Here is the thread for SMP city discussion:

[B]How do I do the infinite water trick?[/B]
Dig a hole 1 block deep, 1 block wide, 3 blocks long, like so: (from  top)

[][][]

Make a bucket:

XXX
IXI
XIX

X = nothing
I = iron bar

collect 2 water blocks using buckets (if you have one bucket, place one  water block then go back and get another, place it)

place water in 3 block hole like so:

WXW

X = nothing
W = water

The centre block will be an infinte source.

This does not work for lava.

[b]What are these creatures and what do they do?[/b]

[b]Creepers[/b] are the green things with four legs, they simply walk up do you and explode. They drop powder which can be used to make TNT along with sand.

[b]Skeletons[/b] are the walking bones you see, and they shoot arrows at you. Just strafe them and land a couple hits with your sword on them. They drop arrows.

[b]Spiders[/b] are the bane of every miner&#39;s existance. They jump really high and can usually outrun you. They are wide, however, so they have trouble getting through doorways. These drop string so you can make bows.

[b]Zombies[/b] are really not much of a threat, but can attack you from above and kill you. They drop feathers for whatever reason which are used to make arrows.

[b]Pigs[/b] are friendly creatures which give you meat when you kill them, and if you find a sattle, you can &quot;ride&quot; them.

[b]Sheep[/b] are friendly and will drop wool/cloth, which is mostly useless.

[b]Cows[/b] drop leather when killed, and leather is used to make armor. They also double as musical instruments.

[B]How do I make XYZ?[/B]

All recipes are here:
[URL]http://www.echidnatribe.org/Minecraft/crafting.php[/URL]

[B]How do I grow things?[/B]

Trees apparently need 2 blocks of space around them.

     Code:
     [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][S][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

[ ] = block
[s] = sapling 
To grow wheat, you need the tilled dirt blocks to be (I think)  &lt; 3 blocks away from a water source to get the tilled dirt wet.
Till grass to gain seeds.
Wait till the wheat looks yellowy brown before harvesting.

[B]How do I stream?[/B]
[URL]http://www.livestream.com/[/URL]
Go to that site, sign up, download their software, the rest should be  explained there.
If anyone has some better instructions, PM me and I&#39;ll add them.

[B]What&#39;s with the glasses?[/B]
Nothing. They don&#39;t exist anymore.

[B]How do I make logic gates with Redstone?[/B]

+ Gold is just as weak as wood, use diamond instead!
+ Placing sand directly above lava turns it into lava!
+ The simplest way to make your tower monster proof, is to have an under water entrance.
+ Saves can be found in &quot;C:\Documents and  Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\.minecraft
+ To get water to flow how you want, put the spawn so it can only go in  one direction/the directions you want, then use blocks to guide the  water. You can then delete the blocks (but not the ones around the  spawn)
+ Don&#39;t have a sword? Use an Axe! Axes are the 2nd strongest weapon against mobs! Order: Strongest - Sword, Axe, Pickaxe, Shovel, Fists - Weakest
+ When fighting spiders, go in a door-sized gap or hole in the wall, if any. Because spiders are fat 2x1x2 creatures, they cannot get through small holes!
+ Sheep, pigs, and cows can get hurt when you try to herd them, but if you want to get them somewhere without hurting them, use snowballs!
+ Snowballs are actually quite useful when fighting enemies around lava, as you can go rapid fire on them and hit them into lava!
+ If you are complaining about a lack of iron, you havn&#39;t looked enough. Do down into a deep cave as far as you can with a couple pickaxes, [b]lots[/b] of torches, 30 or so logs, 3 pork/bread, and a sword or two. Just go down as far as you can and you&#39;ll soon have iron out your ears.
+ There&#39;s a certain set distance that diamond is down, so you have to be very close to the bottom of the map to have a chance of finding it!

[release]+ [URL=&quot;http://notch.tumblr.com/&quot;]Notch&#39;s Blog![/URL]  sssSsSSsssSecret friday updates galore!
+ [URL=&quot;http://twitter.com/xnotch&quot;]Notch&#39;s Twitter![/URL]
Notch is quite active on twitter, and will sometimes &quot;leak&quot; info about the new updates in replies and such!
+ [URL=&quot;http://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=1c111&quot;]Notch&#39;s Google Moderator Page![/URL]
Notch has had many ways of seeing suggestions and answering them, weather it be forumspring, the MC forums, or this, but this seems to be a good way for him to see good ideas.

[B]Past updates:[/B]

[B]Update #1[/B]
Minecarts + Tracks!
UPDATE: You can now ride minecarts! (But you can no longer store things  in them)

[B]Update #2[/B]
Treasure rooms made of mossy cobblestone. Contain:

Chests full of treasure, including saddles, which you can use to ride  pigs.
Mob spawners, which spawn enemies. When you pick them up, placing  them again causes them to spawn pigs. EDIT: For some reason, you  can&#39;t pick them up any more.

[B]Update #3[/B]
 [URL=&quot;http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6741/sfu3byoctopie.png&quot;][IMG_thumb]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6741/sfu3byoctopie.png[/IMG_thumb][/URL]

[B]Update #4[/B]
Snow and Ice!   
Each time you generate a new world, there&#39;s a chance that it&#39;ll be  snowing! Lakes will be covered in ice, and snowflakes will clutter your  vision.

[B]Update #4.1[/B]
Snowballs!
You gain snowballs from breaking snow, which can be used to craft snow blocks.
Plus various bug fixes.

[b]Update $5[/b]
BOATS!!
You can now construct boats, and random large trees, and cacti, now spawn.
Snowballs can stack to 16, and you only need 4 to create a snowblock, and animals only spawn on grass.

[b]Update #5.1[/b]
The stuttering and death big has been fixed! You can now play on a difficulty again with out the worry of losing your save!
Leaves now decay again, boats only crash when going above a certain speed, and they turn much nicer.

[b]Update #5.1.1[/b]
Levels &quot;load better&quot; now.

[b]Update #6[/b]
There are cows, and they drop leather. The leather is now used to make leather armor and cloth will soon be used to make robes instead as notch said. Cows will also soon be able to give milk, but it does not work yet.

[b]Notch&#39;s Plans![/b]
From his Brocraft Stream on July 14.
Thanks to Chezhead
[code]
- He says he may add ham sandwiches
- He wants to add coins. He likes coins in games.
- He wants to make alchemy magic, and would use it for taming animals. No fireballs or offensive things. More fun, less war.
- He wants to add sharks as a passive mob.
- He will most likely keep the spawns where they are, as you can&#39;t move them, but he may add teleporters.
- In game maps or visualizers? Almost certainly. It will be a craftable object.
- Boxers, not briefs.
- The riding pigs was a joke. But there will be some animals you can control like... flaming birds?
- As said before, he wants to add prefixes, like flaming birds, shadow creeper, etc. 
- Very creepy mob he may implement: Mobs that only move when you don&#39;t look at them, much like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who or Boos from mario.
- Kill notch, get an apple. You can make this into a golden apple.
- The dungeon/ruins have a small chance of having golden apples.
- Magic may be used to make monster spawners.
- NO advanced trading, just dropping items...
- There will be LAN play, so you can play offline.
- NPCs? OPs may be able to add NPCs, but it would be &quot;very complex&quot;
- Notch fixed the &quot;Last thing mined disappears&quot; bug in this update.
- He will probably heighten the skybox, but not soon. No infinite hight, ever.
- He wants to make more uses for flint and steel.
- He tried implemented fences, but it &quot;went all horrible&quot;.
- Grappling hooks? Maybe.
- Powered minecarts are confirmed.
- Zombie Seige will not be in it&#39;s own game mode, and zombies will be able to break blocks. There will be certain nights were the moon will be red or something which indicates a zombie horde.
- Notch dies in lava really fast.
- Music changing in different places? Sure.
- Grates? He will add that.
- Notch has Hedgehog a name? Sparkles.
- Maybe fast travel.
- He likes the idea of land flags.
- You can steal stuff from other&#39;s chests.
- He will add slimes. It&#39;s going to be more of an annoyance.
- Notch gets suprise-attacked by a monster.
- Crafting beds could pass time like oblivion and possibly recover health, but maybe only food could restore health.
- Sleeping in SMP could be a ten minute break where you can&#39;t get back to the server for 10 minutes.
- The water is &quot;too much work and really, really difficult&quot;.
- He likes the idea of clouds slowing things down, and being physically active with the player. 
- He may make Diamond last longer, and iron last longer
- He may make diamond last forever
- He will add enemies that spawn deep down, but aren&#39;t afraid of light.
- Facebook integration? Maybe?
- Mineville. It&#39;s going to happen.
- Cobblestone next to mossy cobblestone will be turned mossy.
- Boats? There may be mulitple kinds of boats if it&#39;s needed.
- ctl-click functions sound good to Notch.
- Mandatory eating or drinking? Nope. Maybe you lose health when cold, though.
- Gayb- I mean, Rainbows with gold at the end?
- Notch has seen the facebooks and the twitters.
- Megabeasts will be persistent, and so will certain tagged mobs. (editor&#39;s note: YES)
- 1000 livestream viewers! 
- More liquids! Oil?
- Blocks that can be placed on top of redstone dust, nope.
- Cobblestone next to water turns mossy
- Everything that gives off light gives off heat/melts things in the current game
- Red stuff will not be made into sentries
- Notch finds Gabe Newel attractive and admits his furry fandom
- Summoning can be done with rituals and magic.
- There will be dyes
- If you make a compass, it would display the direction on the item, not the UI.
- &quot;Doors that look like rock?&quot; &quot;Possibly&quot;
- He doesn&#39;t smoke weed &quot;right now&quot; and tells us that drugs are bad.
- Rana is gone forever
- No stackable food
- Siege weapons confirmed
- Food may stack in furnaces, but can be only pulled out one at a time
- Stronger bows? Not really, but he wants to &quot;mess around with the arrows&quot;
- *Gabe Newel Fat joke*
- He may not add the old trees back, but may...
- &quot;Ah, I&#39;ll just add them in.&quot; (Trees)
- Rain will affect the world like snow, but he&#39;s not sure how. Irrigation or possible puddles. &quot;I wanted to do it but it&#39;s complicated.&quot;
- You will connect to servers through direct IPs and by the client or web page, and LAN servers won&#39;t have to confirm with minecraft.net.
- Possibly achievements. (You mine 10,000,000 blocks, etc.) Maybe hats.
- &quot;[Hedgehogs] could be a good idea! It hurts if you step on it.&quot;
- Lava could possibly be an alternate heat for furnaces, but it wouldn&#39;t last forever.

QUESTION TIME

Is notch a martial arts master? Nope.
TF2 is this favorite European war-themed hat simulator.
Notch has a fedora. A really expensive one.
He did not expect to be still working on it or for it to be this big.
Notch thinks that shared accounts are good for advertisement, but doesn&#39;t like them much.

- Leather armor would be what cloth armor is now, and cloth armor would be cloaks and capes.
- No bouncy platforms.
- No jetpacks.
- He likes the &quot;super crazy flying spells&quot; idea.
- Obsidian tools
- The tutorial levels will be a short level with &quot;lots of signs&quot; and would be teaching them about the fact there is no real point.
- Ghosts!
- After a while, this will be opensource and something with API.
- He likes the idea of letting owners of the game looking though the code.
- Farming will be more diverse with more food. &quot;Pumpkins, carrots, some day I&#39;m really going to go crazy with that.&quot;
- Wet sand, then it will turn into dry sand which will just stay there. When touched, it would fall.
- &quot;We should have a ritual that makes blocks glow&quot; &quot;Absolutely&quot;
- If a nun and a midget walk into a bar, what happens?&quot; &quot;Probably a punch line.&quot;
- Road system where you move faster. 
- There may be horses or donkeys.
- He wants all the monsters to be evil, and all the animals to be good. Make-believe things - bad. Real things - Good.
- No unlockable crafting recipes.
- Notch loves achievements.
- Unique events could be achievements, like when you ride a pig off a cliff or mine your first diamond. He ways he wants them to be things to get new players to explore new parts of the game.
- Notch is going to end the stream, and show us some multiplayer footage! It&#39;s jsut going to be the bare bones, but a development none-the-less.

MULTIPLAYER TIME!

- Players are invisible at the moment. It seems like nothing different than what we thought. It seems there is no breaking animation. He will release some early versions.
- In the first version of SMP, you will not be able to fight enemies with each other, as monsters will be clientside.
- There will be PvP servers.
-Erp, the server crashed. It looks like water isn&#39;t working. He thinks that a player got attacked by a monster and died, thus crashing the server.
- Oohh! The SMP server he has is infinite! He says he will be starting with the hard stuff first...
- Buckets will melt as soon as you place lava out of it.
- &quot;When are we getting chickens?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot;
- He wants to add elevators.
- Natural Disasters
- Single player maps can be used for SMP! (Editor&#39;s note - my town can be used!)
- He&#39;s going to fix the &quot;F&quot; glitch.
- Moving lighting is really hard and nauseating.
- Thrown torches!
- To-do list is no updated anymore.
- There will be crouching. &quot;When you press the crouching button, you won&#39;t fall off cliffs&quot;
- There will most likely not be an explosive larger than TNT, but there may be a ritual.
- Maybe transmutation circles with red stuff?
- He says he&#39;s fine with people doing anything in single player as long as they are having fun, but will no allow cheating in SMP.
- There will be fish particles, diving, and coral.
- Flame retardant suits!

And thats a wrap!

[B]Minecraft[/B]

Minecraft is a single and multi player game based on placing and  destroying blocks of different materials. It was based on another game,  infiniminer, but with various changes and improvements the game has  really grown and continues to expand on the ideas of infiniminer.
It began its life on May 10, 2009, at the hands of Markus Persson (Also known as Notch, sexy, bald and swedish) It&#39;s currently free to play Minecraft Classic but to play &quot;/game/&quot; you have to pay:

+ 9.95 Euros
+ &#163;8.53 (as of 31/06/10)
+ ~$12-13

via PayPal. The price will double (it is currently half price) when the  game reaches beta stage.

Have you tried uninstalling/re-installing java? Have you updated java?  Have you deleted minecraft.jar and ran the client to re-download it? Try  these before you ask in the thread.

If nobody knows, have you e-mailed Notch?

E-mail all error reports to [EMAIL=&quot;support@mojang.com&quot;]support@mojang.com[/EMAIL]

[B]How do I buy minecraft?[/B]
[highlight]YOU NEED PAYPAL TO PURCHASE MINECRAFT.[/highlight]
Head over to [URL=&quot;http://www.minecraft.net/&quot;]www.minecraft.net[/URL],  register an account, click the &quot;buy now&quot; link at the top right.
Should be self explanatory from there.
You can also purchase minecraft for a friend, by selecting &quot;purchase as  gift&quot;.

[B]Minecraft doesn&#39;t have all the cool stuff I see in the screenshots,  like tools and bacon and creepers![/B]
You need to purchase the game to use these features. Once you have  bought the game, head on over to [URL]http://minecraft.net/game/[/URL] to play! Or  alternatively, download the client from [URL]http://minecraft.net/download.jsp[/URL]

[B]How do I access /game/?[/B]
[URL]http://minecraft.net/game/[/URL]
[URL]http://minecraft.net/download.jsp[/URL]

[B]How do I use custom texture packs?[/B]

#1: Download the texture pack. It should be in a .rar file.
#2: Open the texture pack in WinRAR.
#3: Go to %appdata%\.minecraft\bin\ and right click minecraft.jar --&gt;  open with --&gt; WinRAR
#4: The files in the texture pack should be in a structure with  terrain.png in the root folder (it should be visible when you open the  .rar) and folders such as armor, mobs etc.
#5: If #4 is true, Drag/Drop the texture files from the pack to  minecraft.jar (open in winRAR)
#6: Run minecraft!

NOTE: Your textures will be wiped if Notch updates terrain.png, so be  prepared to re-install packs often.

[B]I have installed a texture pack - some objects are pink/do not appear  at all[/B]

Your texture pack is not up to date. Wait for the creator to post the  latest version.
Alternatively, create the new textures yourself (edit terrain.png and  the other files)

[B]How do I create my own texture pack?[/B] (Thanks to DeanWinchester  for this answer!)
1. Get WinRAR
2. Go to &quot;%appdata%\.minecraft\bin\minecraft.jar&quot;
3. Open &quot;minecraft.jar&quot; with WinRAR
4. Create a folder somewhere called &quot;Minecraft Textures&quot;
5. Extract all png/gif files in there, as well as the folders:
&quot;armor&quot;
&quot;art&quot;
&quot;gui&quot;
&quot;item&quot;
&quot;misc&quot;
&quot;mob&quot;
&quot;terrain&quot;

to the folder you created.
6. Edit them and save.
7. Drag and drop everything from your &quot;Minecraft Textures&quot; folder back  into the jar file that is opened with WinRAR (following the same folder  structure) and let them replace the others.
8. Play and enjoy :D

[B]Will you buy minecraft for me?[/B]
No.
Some users run competitions, enter those.
Also, if you are willing to offer something in return, e.g. a game of  equivalent price, (because you can&#39;t use paypal for some reason) then  feel free to ask.
If you do beg (asking more than once), you are likely to be shunned. You  have been warned.

[B]How do I do the infinite water trick?[/B]
Dig a hole 1 block deep, 1 block wide, 3 blocks long, like so: (from  top)

[][][]

Make a bucket:

XXX
IXI
XIX

X = nothing
I = iron bar

collect 2 water blocks using buckets (if you have one bucket, place one  water block then go back and get another, place it)

place water in 3 block hole like so:

WXW

X = nothing
W = water

The centre block will be an infinte source.

This does not work for lava.

[b]What are these creatures and what do they do?[/b]

[b]Creepers[/b] are the green things with four legs, they simply walk up do you and explode. They drop powder which can be used to make TNT along with sand.

[b]Skeletons[/b] are the walking bones you see, and they shoot arrows at you. Just strafe them and land a couple hits with your sword on them. They drop arrows.

[b]Spiders[/b] are the bane of every miner&#39;s existance. They jump really high and can usually outrun you. They are wide, however, so they have trouble getting through doorways. These drop string so you can make bows.

[b]Zombies[/b] are really not much of a threat, but can attack you from above and kill you. They drop feathers for whatever reason which are used to make arrows.

[b]Pigs[/b] are friendly creatures which give you meat when you kill them, and if you find a sattle, you can &quot;ride&quot; them.

[b]Sheep[/b] are friendly and will drop wool/cloth, which is mostly useless.

[b]Cows[/b] drop leather when killed, and leather is used to make armor. They also double as musical instruments.

[B]How do I make XYZ?[/B]

All recipes are here:
[URL]http://www.echidnatribe.org/Minecraft/crafting.php[/URL]

[B]How do I grow things?[/B]

Trees apparently need 2 blocks of space around them.

     Code:
     [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][S][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
[ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

[ ] = block
[s] = sapling 
To grow wheat, you need the tilled dirt blocks to be (I think)  &lt; 3 blocks away from a water source to get the tilled dirt wet.
Till grass to gain seeds.
Wait till the wheat looks yellowy brown before harvesting.

[B]How do I stream?[/B]
[URL]http://www.livestream.com/[/URL]
Go to that site, sign up, download their software, the rest should be  explained there.
If anyone has some better instructions, PM me and I&#39;ll add them.

[B]What&#39;s with the glasses?[/B]
Nothing. They don&#39;t exist anymore.

+ Gold is just as weak as wood, use diamond instead!
+ Placing sand directly above lava turns it into lava!
+ The simplest way to make your tower monster proof, is to have an under water entrance.
+ Saves can be found in &quot;C:\Documents and  Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\.minecraft
+ To get water to flow how you want, put the spawn so it can only go in  one direction/the directions you want, then use blocks to guide the  water. You can then delete the blocks (but not the ones around the  spawn)
+ Don&#39;t have a sword? Use an Axe! Axes are the 2nd strongest weapon against mobs! Order: Strongest - Sword, Axe, Pickaxe, Shovel, Fists - Weakest
+ When fighting spiders, go in a door-sized gap or hole in the wall, if any. Because spiders are fat 2x1x2 creatures, they cannot get through small holes!
+ Sheep, pigs, and cows can get hurt when you try to herd them, but if you want to get them somewhere without hurting them, use snowballs!
+ Snowballs are actually quite useful when fighting enemies around lava, as you can go rapid fire on them and hit them into lava!
+ If you are complaining about a lack of iron, you havn&#39;t looked enough. Do down into a deep cave as far as you can with a couple pickaxes, [b]lots[/b] of torches, 30 or so logs, 3 pork/bread, and a sword or two. Just go down as far as you can and you&#39;ll soon have iron out your ears.
+ There&#39;s a certain set distance that diamond is down, so you have to be very close to the bottom of the map to have a chance of finding it!
