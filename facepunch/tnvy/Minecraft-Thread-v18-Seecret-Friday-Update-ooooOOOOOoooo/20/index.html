It all started off with a small farming village who lived off the land. It only consisted of around 30 people, but each year more and more people started arriving and setting up in Facepunchia. Soon enough there was over 100 people living in Facepunchia as it thrived from the growth. The main source of income was from the farmers as Facepunchia was known for it&#39;s perfectly grown crops and perfectly grown cattle. Many wanted to know how this small village was thriving so much, was it the farmers? Was it the land? 

After a couple or so more years, Facepunchia had a population of 1000 people, soon enough the big tycoons were attracted to this location in search for the secret to the villages profit. As they moved in to seize the land, factories, machinery and workers migrated to Facepunchia. Soon enough the little village of Facepunchia was now a mass of smoke and big money tycoons. Everyone forgot what it had once used to be and the secret now lost. To this very day though Facepunchia is the biggest money making city in Minecraft, not that it wanted to be.

A millenia ago, there lived a nomadic tribe of people called the Prunes. One day, almost all of the Prunes got killed on a trek through a cave. 
Only Chief Pruney, his wife, and daughter survived.
Because the Prunes were nomadic, Chief Pruney built a house on a bay not far from the cave where his tribesmen had perished.
The Prunes had a great deity named Daijitsu. 
Chief Pruney would pray to Daijitsu every night that they would someday again find civilization.
Then one day, a massive tidal wave swept across the bay and crashed into Chief Pruney&#39;s house, rendering him and his family unconscious.
When Chief Pruney woke up, he found himself in the city of Facepunchia.
It&#39;s location is unknown."

                            <span v-pre>Ok wait, how about this?

A millenia ago, there lived a nomadic tribe of people called the Prunes. One day, almost all of the Prunes got killed on a trek through a cave. 
Only Chief Pruney, his wife, and daughter survived.
Because the Prunes were nomadic, Chief Pruney built a house on a bay not far from the cave where his tribesmen had perished.
The Prunes had a great deity named Daijitsu. 
Chief Pruney would pray to Daijitsu every night that they would someday again find civilization.
Then one day, a massive tidal wave swept across the bay and crashed into Chief Pruney&#39;s house, rendering him and his family unconscious.
When Chief Pruney woke up, he found himself in the city of Facepunchia.
It&#39;s location is unknown.</span>

I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse, that I horribly underestimated both the speed and range of these carts, that the non-roofed sections just turn into pork roadblocks, or that they handle jumps but not drops.  You can do well over 20 block stretches with no change in elevation and still be cruising like a motherfucker.

Time to start over.  Again."

I&#39;ve started work on the castle here. I know it has no windows but i&#39;m trying to make the whole thing first. 

Heres the current plan. It has 2 fully done floors and the top one to be done. (Should i add maybe 2 more?)
[IMG]http://i302.photobucket.com/albums/nn81/Initiatedprune/castle1.jpg[/IMG]

There is also a huge spiral staircase leading to all of the floors.

Finally there is a HUGE dungeon that i need to renevate.

There is also a huge spiral staircase leading to all of the floors.

I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse, that I horribly underestimated both the speed and range of these carts, that the non-roofed sections just turn into pork roadblocks, or that they handle jumps but not drops.

Time to start over again.[/QUOTE]

I&#39;ve been curious, how many blocks high do I need to get to top speed? I&#39;ve been trying to set up a speedy Minecart transportation system for my super tunnel, so I want to get the Minecart to go as fast as possible because the tunnel is sooOOooo long.

This is for the Small Farming, VOTE AGREE!

[QUOTE=Pruneyboy;22938565]
It all started off with a small farming village who lived off the land. It only consisted of around 30 people, but each year more and more people started arriving and setting up in Facepunchia. Soon enough there was over 100 people living in Facepunchia as it thrived from the growth. The main source of income was from the farmers as Facepunchia was known for it&#39;s perfectly grown crops and perfectly grown cattle. Many wanted to know how this small village was thriving so much, was it the farmers? Was it the land? 

After a couple or so more years, Facepunchia had a population of 1000 people, soon enough the big tycoons were attracted to this location in search for the secret to the villages profit. As they moved in to seize the land, factories, machinery and workers migrated to Facepunchia. Soon enough the little village of Facepunchia was now a mass of smoke and big money tycoons. Everyone forgot what it had once used to be and the secret now lost. To this very day though Facepunchia is the biggest money making city in Minecraft, not that it wanted to be.

[QUOTE=silentjubjub]A millenia ago, there lived a nomadic tribe of people called the Prunes. One day, almost all of the Prunes got killed on a trek through a cave.
Only Chief Pruney, his wife, and daughter survived.
Because the Prunes were nomadic, Chief Pruney built a house on a bay not far from the cave where his tribesmen had perished.
The Prunes had a great deity named Daijitsu.
Chief Pruney would pray to Daijitsu every night that they would someday again find civilization.
Then one day, a massive tidal wave swept across the bay and crashed into Chief Pruney&#39;s house, rendering him and his family unconscious.
When Chief Pruney woke up, he found himself in the city of Facepunchia.[/QUOTE]"
