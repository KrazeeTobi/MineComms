every game needs a fanfic dealing with sex[/QUOTE]

I typed this up for another place, but I&#39;m sure it fits the bill.

It was getting dark. I had to leave my mine and head for home. I had made it perhaps within 100 yards of my home when I heard a faint whisper. I stopped for a second and looked around, nothing was there. My pace increased from a walk to a slow jog. Eventually I reached the house and exhaled deeply, my mind now at ease.

No sooner than I entered the bedroom had I heard that noise again, but it was louder now. Had I forgotten to barricade the door? My eyes widened, glancing around the room. There, in the dark corner, stood the intruder. He approached me and torchlight cast upon him. He stood slightly taller than me on his 4 legs. Studying him more closely, I was horrified at the sight of his huge, green, blocky penis, Both now stood erect, ready for action. That horrible, HORRIBLE sound now louder than ever as he charged me with his throbbing member.

He was too quick for me, and that was made immediately apparent as I was pinned to the ground with legs spread. He stood over me now, savoring the moment. He caressed me and leaned in, licking then whispering into my ear, &quot;SSSSSsSsSSS.&quot;  I knew what was going to happen and prepared myself. That was of little use. He slammed into me over and over, his manhood tearing up my tight blocky ass. It seemed as if his dick was over 8 times the surface area of earth.

He doubled his speed with every thrust, his diamond pick tearing through my hole. He was spelunking my ass, and I could do nothing about it. I felt something expanding in me. His head. And it was about to run out of room and my ass was already having enough trouble accomodating his dick. I closed my eyes, which had already filled with tears, waiting for the inevitable. He hissed again, it was a deafining, ear-splitting sound.

&quot;sssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S!!&quot;

I let out a massive grunt. My asshole had exploded. Hot smoke filled the room. I lied there, for what I imagined was an eternity. I raised my head to look around. The intruder was nowhere to be found, but he had left my house in shambles. I gazed through a hole in the wall to find it was still dark out. My ears, though still ringing, heard something chilling; the whispers of countless others, who had been waiting for their chance."

every game needs a fanfic dealing with sex[/QUOTE]

I typed this up for another place, but I&#39;m sure it fits the bill.

It was getting dark. I had to leave my mine and head for home. I had made it perhaps within 100 yards of my home when I heard a faint whisper. I stopped for a second and looked around, nothing was there. My pace increased from a walk to a slow jog. Eventually I reached the house and exhaled deeply, my mind now at ease.

No sooner than I entered the bedroom had I heard that noise again, but it was louder now. Had I forgotten to barricade the door? My eyes widened, glancing around the room. There, in the dark corner, stood the intruder. He approached me and torchlight cast upon him. He stood slightly taller than me on his 4 legs. Studying him more closely, I was horrified at the sight of his huge, green, blocky penis, Both now stood erect, ready for action. That horrible, HORRIBLE sound now louder than ever as he charged me with his throbbing member.

He was too quick for me, and that was made immediately apparent as I was pinned to the ground with legs spread. He stood over me now, savoring the moment. He caressed me and leaned in, licking then whispering into my ear, &quot;SSSSSsSsSSS.&quot;  I knew what was going to happen and prepared myself. That was of little use. He slammed into me over and over, his manhood tearing up my tight blocky ass. It seemed as if his dick was over 8 times the surface area of earth.

He doubled his speed with every thrust, his diamond pick tearing through my hole. He was spelunking my ass, and I could do nothing about it. I felt something expanding in me. His head. And it was about to run out of room and my ass was already having enough trouble accomodating his dick. I closed my eyes, which had already filled with tears, waiting for the inevitable. He hissed again, it was a deafining, ear-splitting sound.

&quot;sssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S!!&quot;

I let out a massive grunt. My asshole had exploded. Hot smoke filled the room. I lied there, for what I imagined was an eternity. I raised my head to look around. The intruder was nowhere to be found, but he had left my house in shambles. I gazed through a hole in the wall to find it was still dark out. My ears, though still ringing, heard something chilling; the whispers of countless others, who had been waiting for their chance.</span>

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=SomeFaggot;22937462]I typed this up for another place, but I&#39;m sure it fits the bill.

It was getting dark. I had to leave my mine and head for home. I had made it perhaps within 100 yards of my home when I heard a faint whisper. I stopped for a second and looked around, nothing was there. My pace increased from a walk to a slow jog. Eventually I reached the house and exhaled deeply, my mind now at ease.

No sooner than I entered the bedroom had I heard that noise again, but it was louder now. Had I forgotten to barricade the door? My eyes widened, glancing around the room. There, in the dark corner, stood the intruder. He approached me and torchlight cast upon him. He stood slightly taller than me on his 4 legs. Studying him more closely, I was horrified at the sight of his huge, green, blocky penis, Both now stood erect, ready for action. That horrible, HORRIBLE sound now louder than ever as he charged me with his throbbing member.

He was too quick for me, and that was made immediately apparent as I was pinned to the ground with legs spread. He stood over me now, savoring the moment. He caressed me and leaned in, licking then whispering into my ear, &quot;SSSSSsSsSSS.&quot;  I knew what was going to happen and prepared myself. That was of little use. He slammed into me over and over, his manhood tearing up my tight blocky ass. It seemed as if his dick was over 8 times the surface area of earth.

He doubled his speed with every thrust, his diamond pick tearing through my hole. He was spelunking my ass, and I could do nothing about it. I felt something expanding in me. His head. And it was about to run out of room and my ass was already having enough trouble accomodating his dick. I closed my eyes, which had already filled with tears, waiting for the inevitable. He hissed again, it was a deafining, ear-splitting sound.

&quot;sssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S!!&quot;

I let out a massive grunt. My asshole had exploded. Hot smoke filled the room. I lied there, for what I imagined was an eternity. I raised my head to look around. The intruder was nowhere to be found, but he had left my house in shambles. I gazed through a hole in the wall to find it was still dark out. My ears, though still ringing, heard something chilling; the whispers of countless others, who had been waiting for their chance.[/QUOTE]
