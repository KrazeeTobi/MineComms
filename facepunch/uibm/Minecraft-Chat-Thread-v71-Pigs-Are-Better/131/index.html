[QUOTE=DragonAwesome;44245983]Furnace minecarts were useful until they &quot;revamped&quot; the minecart physics.
Now a furnace minecart can barely push anything other than a minecart with a player in it.

What&#39;s even worse is that they decided minecarts needed momentum, except they were too lazy to do it properly so now it&#39;s easier to push a filled minecart uphill than it is an empty minecart. That means if you want to send an empty minecart up a hill, you literally need every single rail to be a powered rail. What were they thinking? Did they even test it?[/QUOTE]"

[QUOTE=DragonAwesome;44245983]Furnace minecarts were useful until they &quot;revamped&quot; the minecart physics.
Now a furnace minecart can barely push anything other than a minecart with a player in it.

What&#39;s even worse is that they decided minecarts needed momentum, except they were too lazy to do it properly so now it&#39;s easier to push a filled minecart uphill than it is an empty minecart. That means if you want to send an empty minecart up a hill, you literally need every single rail to be a powered rail. What were they thinking? Did they even test it?[/QUOTE]</span>

 There&#39;s also no way to link the carts together, which is more of an annoyance than anything.

Cargo minecarts are useless, though, because they instantly stop moving as soon as they enter an unloaded chunk, which is [I]all the fucking time[/I]."

There&#39;s this as well. Why doesn&#39;t Mojang just take FML with the devs permission and merge it into Minecraft? The thing may be hacky currently, but it&#39;s the best modding tool Minecraft has currently (though some might disagree.)

Besides, too many modders use Forge and the mod API is almost certainly going to need them to rewrite their mods. I just hope someone makes a modification to Forge that&#39;d allow it to be installed through the mod API."

There&#39;s this as well. Why doesn&#39;t Mojang just take FML with the devs permission and merge it into Minecraft? The thing may be hacky currently, but it&#39;s the best modding tool Minecraft has currently (though some might disagree.)

Besides, too many modders use Forge and the mod API is almost certainly going to need them to rewrite their mods. I just hope someone makes a modification to Forge that&#39;d allow it to be installed through the mod API.</span>

The &quot;Mod API&quot; they are working on goes much further than what Forge is doing. The Mod API involves rewriting most of Minecraft code (which is what they&#39;ve been doing for a while now) to make it properly moddable and easy to update and extend in the future. Forge is a giant mess and will only increase the workload each update.

The original author of the Minecraft Coder Pack (Searge) now works at Mojang and is also working on the Mod API. Whenever the Mod API is finished (including in-game mod selecting/installing Mojang has talked about) it&#39;ll make all other APIs (Forge etc) redundant. Given the Mod API should in theory be more extendable and way more stable and less resource intensive, mod authors would need to update to it instead of using older things such as Forge."

Yes, as long as the API methods used don&#39;t change between versions.

Think of it like how garry&#39;s mod addons work. When there is a big change internally (gmod 12 -&gt; gmod 13) then yes, addons will need to be updated. But otherwise, they work across versions."

                        <postrender input="I need a little help with a bug.

Up until just now my game worked flawlessly. When I just tried to connect to a server no games would appear in the multiplayer list. After doing a direct connect I found that my mouse was being hyper sensitive/ moved in odd directions. 

What makes this really strange is on the menu and inventory screens the mouse works as usual. My keyboard input works fine too.

I Google&#39;d it and some suggested pressing F8, which did nothing, I also tried to restart/reinstall the game several times with no success. I disabled my texture pack/footsteps sound mod, this too did nothing. 

Can&#39;t spot much more with Google so I&#39;m wondering if anyone here has come across this and can help me out?

Update: Disabling my AV (Kaspersky) seems to have cured the issue, even after switching it back on the issue is gone. Strange."

                            <span v-pre>I need a little help with a bug.

Up until just now my game worked flawlessly. When I just tried to connect to a server no games would appear in the multiplayer list. After doing a direct connect I found that my mouse was being hyper sensitive/ moved in odd directions. 

What makes this really strange is on the menu and inventory screens the mouse works as usual. My keyboard input works fine too.

I Google&#39;d it and some suggested pressing F8, which did nothing, I also tried to restart/reinstall the game several times with no success. I disabled my texture pack/footsteps sound mod, this too did nothing. 

Can&#39;t spot much more with Google so I&#39;m wondering if anyone here has come across this and can help me out?

Update: Disabling my AV (Kaspersky) seems to have cured the issue, even after switching it back on the issue is gone. Strange.</span>
