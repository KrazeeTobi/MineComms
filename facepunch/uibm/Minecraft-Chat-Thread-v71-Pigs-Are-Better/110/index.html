It&#39;s just that kind of game.

After playing for a few days, or weeks, or maybe months, you&#39;ll get burnt out, and quit for awhile.

The best ways to learn are to either:
1) Dive in and try to focus on one mod at a time before figuring out how to make them work together.
2) Read the wiki (BOOOORING!)
3) Watch youtube videos in which people play it, such as direwolf20&#39;s channel. (possibly Hat Films too, but they don&#39;t have a clue what they&#39;re doing half the time either :V)"

the only mod I want is one to build a ship from blocks, with cannons, mythical sea monsters, enemy humanoid mobs, treasure islands, forts and more magic. Ships with enemies in the water would make sea environments more fun.</span>

Not Enough Items is your friend. If you hover over an item and press &quot;r&quot;, you&#39;ll see how to craft said item. With a few exceptions, this&#39;ll show if you need a specific machine to get it. If you press &quot;u&quot; over the item, it&#39;ll show you all the recipes that that item is used in.

If it&#39;s not turning up any recipes, that&#39;s when you should look up the mod it&#39;s from, or if you&#39;re not sure about that, just google the name of the item and &quot;minecraft mod&quot; and it&#39;ll usually give you a wiki page on it.

If you&#39;re at a crafting bench and you look at a recipe, it&#39;ll have a little ? to the bottom right of the recipe. Clicking on that will add ghost blocks to the crafting table to make crafting easier. A handy tip: If you shift+click it, it&#39;ll try to autocomplete the recipe with the items in your inventory, and if you&#39;re missing anything you need to craft it it won&#39;t."

                            <span v-pre>There&#39;s a mod called What Am I Looking At that adds what mod an item is from. You can also type @Mod.modname to filter out to items from that mod. Though if you do have WAILA you can just type the mod name and it&#39;ll generally do the same thing since it adds it to the tooltip.
