Anvils, enchanted books that you can use with anvils to selectively apply enchantments to things, Daylight sensors, redstone blocks, redstone &quot;comparators&quot;, hoppers, trapped chests, decorative Quartz that comes in 3 different flavors + stairs and slabs, some other redstone shit I&#39;m probably forgetting (1.5 was a redstone heavy update), and apparently some bugfixes.</span>

[quote]Team survival mode

Same as Survival mode, except players are divided into two or more teams.

Fortress mode

After having built a level in Creative or Survival mode, you and your friends connect to another fortress made by some other people. The map gets bigger so it fits both maps, and you play a game on this map. Perhaps Capture the Flag, perhaps something else. The last two modes will have weapons and fighting. Probably with arrows with proper physics, so you&#39;d aim diagonally up towards whatever you want to hit.

I had built my Nether Portal in the cavern underneath my house I dug out while trying to find the source of zombie noises.
When I first entered the Nether, I died due to fucking random-ass lava fall. Thankfully, it was close to my portal, so I died there and got my stuff back.
Not long after that, I saw a Zombie Pigman enter my portal. I just thought, &quot;cool&quot;, and quickly found a Nether Fortress.
Died three times there. Once to a mother-fucking gang of Blazes and their punk-ass Magma Cubes(which apparently are drained of their Cream), and twice to mother-fucking Wither Skeletons and their large, rock-hard swords they shoved up my ass.
Anyway, I decided to get the hell outta hell and went home. I found that same Zombie Pigman still there, walking around as the snow fell. I got it to fight a Skeleton that came from a cave system under my house.
So I pushed the Pigman into my house, so he could live there. He didn&#39;t survive until morning.
Cause of death? I accidentally hit him while trying to remove the pressure plate he was standing on so he wouldn&#39;t escape and was forced to kill him with my Iron Chod-err, Iron Giant Sword. :v:
His only drop was his sword, which was in near-perfect condition. So I made a monument to him.

Is there any demand for such a thread? Would probably die out quickly, but it would serve it&#39;s purpose."

Minecraft is one of those games that can produce great personal stories. Just looking through my screenshot folder (thats over 3 years old) i remember tons of great moments.

Is there any demand for such a thread? Would probably die out quickly, but it would serve it&#39;s purpose.</span>

Well, until then, I have two tales I can remember.
The first one is when I was new to Minecraft. I used a seed to spawn in a village so I would have company and pre-built houses. I set my base up in the chapel. After an expedition, I returned to the village at night, and found it crawling head-to-toe with zombies, skeletons, and some creepers. So I did what every minecrafter would do in this situation. I began digging a tunnel under the village to the church, having no idea where it was. At some point, I dug up a little bit to see where I was, and a [B]creeper fell out of the sky, into the tunnel, and blew me up, when my only weapon of self-defence was a shovel.[/B]
When I respawned in the church, I just went to bed to get the night over with. I then spent a few minutes looking for the crater that was my death, to see if any of my items were there. There wasn&#39;t any. Then, as a result, I rage quit.
My second story ends in a similar way, which is me rage-quitting. I had just gotten a diamond pickaxe, and was mining some obsidian. &quot;Just a few more&quot; I said, as I was digging it out. Then, out of nowhere, I find myself engulfed in lava, and quickly died without any time to switch to my water bucket. I stared at my screen in silence, hearing the sound of all of my items burning away. You can guess what happened afterwards."

...Fuck it, I&#39;ll try.
My server-hosting friend decided to start a survival event last year, where everyone started out fresh on a fresh map and it was basically FFA, first player to the End wins. There were about 10 people at most, I think, if not less, and because we were all friends or friends of friends, there wasn&#39;t much PVPing. Plenty of mischief, like thieving from bases and the occasional kill, but nothing malicious. The core group of people - me, the host, my best friend, and someone else I can&#39;t remember - had pretty much established bases and mines the first day, and eventually we were secure with things like guarded nether portals (I built a lava shield around mine, which basically fucked everyone else over) and diamond armor and such. 

Two or three days after the server starts, at a point where most of us are at iron or diamond tier, a &quot;friend of a friend of a friend&quot; gets on. The guy was someone I was acquainted with in real life but couldn&#39;t stand to talk to, because he was just so... [I]stupid.[/I] It was frustrating at times. Anyway, he gets on and starts building a little mud hut and pestering us for how-to information (we told him to use the wiki) and starts snooping around people&#39;s bases. He also had a habit of broadcasting whenever he did something, i.e. &quot;look guyz i found dimonds&quot;, &quot;how do i make the encanting table cus i gots lot of xp&quot;.

I was preparing for the journey to the End in secret at this point, and I needed XP so I went and ambushed the guy. I had diamond gear by then and he had no idea what was going on, so it was kind of a dick move on my part, but the game was FFA as we had all agreed on. The guy goes nuts and starts accusing me of hacking, complaining directly to the host and asking him to ban me, all sorts of shit, but the host could pull up the logs and show that there was no evidence that I had cheated. He wouldn&#39;t shut up though, and complained well into the end of the game and into the next world event, which was using Tekkit. The endgame for [I]that[/I] was him nuking my base with stuff that he [I]had[/I] cheated in. :v:

tl;dr: I ambushed some guy in a FFA survival game and he calls hacks, then becomes a massive hypocrite."

I personally like servers where a lot of cooperation goes on, where trade can be accomplished without stupid plugins, where FTB is present but people don&#39;t just bum-rush to Mass-Fabs to make all the shit they want.
Needless to say no such servers exist."

The thing I don&#39;t like - theoretically, mind you; I&#39;ve not really played any FTB servers - is that you join with nothing, as per usual, and you are at an *immediate* disadvantage to anyone who has been gathering resources before you. There will be people with top-tier armor, huge factories, ludicrously-powerful weapons, and who knows how much mined/harvested resources, meaning you have to run far, far away to set up your own fragile little operation. Until you surpass those people in all of the above, you will be entirely at their mercy. I get that it&#39;s sort of like this in Vanilla, but the advantage only really goes as high as diamond-tier; at least people are killable then, and the most destructive things there are only lava and TNT, not nukes and whatever the hell else."

The thing I don&#39;t like - theoretically, mind you; I&#39;ve not really played any FTB servers - is that you join with nothing, as per usual, and you are at an *immediate* disadvantage to anyone who has been gathering resources before you. There will be people with top-tier armor, huge factories, ludicrously-powerful weapons, and who knows how much mined/harvested resources, meaning you have to run far, far away to set up your own fragile little operation. Until you surpass those people in all of the above, you will be entirely at their mercy. I get that it&#39;s sort of like this in Vanilla, but the advantage only really goes as high as diamond-tier; at least people are killable then, and the most destructive things there are only lava and TNT, not nukes and whatever the hell else.</span>

When 343N had a server I did fairly well despite starting after people had been on it long before me, mostly because everyone else was too lazy to dig for silver or uranium (which at the time you couldn&#39;t make with UU matter). I had a factorization setup where I was at least tripling my silver yields so I had plenty to trade.
So I was basically a dwarf in that server: I lived under a mountain, built fantastic machines, and traded for things with silver. :v:"

Needless to say no such servers exist.[/QUOTE]

Since you got a few agrees, PM me what mods, plugins, version etc you&#39;d like to see.</span>

A well-rounded FTB with GregTech installed (it MASSIVELY balances things out and discourages people from bum-rushing to mass-fabs right away, and encourages people to consider mods besides just &quot;lolmacerators&quot; everywhere, as well as adding a few interesting items) should IDEALLY be all that&#39;s needed, but when you give people a game where they can do whatever they want and create whatever they want, people will opt to be dicks and eventually the server is ruined anyway. Then you have the people who join in and are like &quot;OMG SO COOL&quot;, play for 2-3 weeks, and then stop playing because &quot;LOLFTBANARCHYSERVAR!!!!111eleven&quot; or they simply leave because things are too over-whelming for them.
And then as said you have the chucklefucks who exploit dupe-glitches and run around in Quantum Armor with 15 enchantments on it while dropping duped nukes everywhere.
Really the server I described would best be created as a small private server with a group of friends rather than inviting every Tom, Dick and Harry inside to run amok and either contribute nothing, whine about lack of materials, or just be assholes in general.
Though the WORST people to have in a server (as I found in New Ventlegille back in the day) are the people who will drain you of all the resources you&#39;ve collected (we had a Commons room full of building materials), and then when those resources are used up they&#39;ll leave for a few days and come back hoping to find a chest full of shit to build their hideous cobble-stone monstrosities with, pretty much absolutely refusing to collect anything on their own and, in a round-about way, basically demanding that other people gather shit for them so they can bring their half-assed &quot;grand visions&quot; to life."
