I&#39;m considering starting a texture pack that doesn&#39;t really have a particular theme and just more so my art style. If it had a theme it&#39;d probably be &quot;Cartoon Gruesome&quot; because I like to make my mobs look colorful and detailed but not realistically detailed. I also like to try and make them look bloody and, well, gruesome. (just the enemy mobs of course)

This is the first thing I made. I wanted to give the skeleton mob an actual skull for a head. That was pretty much my main goal for this skin. I&#39;m really happy with it but it looked plain, so I added some blood and cracks.

The Creeper is the second skin I did. I wanted to make it look like some sort of insane creature that had a clever reason for exploding. It&#39;s oozing a sort of acidic goo from its mouth. Not only does it have TNT sticks tied to it, but you can see that the interior of its head also has TNT in it (not my original idea obviously.) I also added some skin patterns to it in order to prevent it from looking boring.

The Ghast is always crying out and making horrifying noises, so I figured I&#39;d try and make it look like an extremely depressed and tortured creature. Lots of gashes, cuts, and an arrow stuck in the side of him. Also sorta made it look like its tentacles were damaged by changing what they look like at the bottom. I also gave it a slight pink tone so that it looks more like something you&#39;d see flying around in the midst of the underworld. This still has a lot scheduled to change, I was waving my imagination around when I made this.

This is an apple.

Should I continue? I have a lot of work ahead of me and it&#39;s pretty overwhelming.

I&#39;d also like to mention that the Cowtoon Texture Pack was a big boost of motivation. I love how that texture pack looks and it really motivated me to get off my ass and start doing this."

It seems if you fight a zombie or one sees you, all zombies near that location will start moving towards the fight.

Also i did see a zombie just appear mid-air and then fall to the ground as well, so i guess they do also spawm more? Would be cooler if there was some animation of the zombie rising from the ground instead  of falling from the sky."

I mean, if you want realism, don&#39;t be playing fucking Minecraft.

I told him that, and then he replied &quot;well why do you think people get those texture packs ;)&quot;

So there is no protection other than trust. This trust was broken today, resulting in two players quitting.

I can foresee this happening in the future unless I add some sort of protection mod, and I really need ideas how to keep it minimal. Here&#39;s my plan so far:

• Allow citizens to set up their houses in a village that has TNT and creeper protection; Maybe even have like standard housing ready for players to move into.
• Inside the village, houses won&#39;t be protected with a mod, so their main function is as a spawn point, personal furnaces, unprotected chests (Probably for small amounts of iron, coal and other common blocks)
• Then if a player want&#39;s to store rare item&#39;s I am going to have one massive village bank, where players can buy protected chests for a diamond each
• The village will also have PVP off (If that is possible) 
• Once outside the village, anything goes, perhaps you can buy land from admins for like 1 diamond per 50 blocks of land, and chests outside the village for like 5 diamonds each.

Any better ideas? Also could people suggests mods for my needs?"

I can foresee this happening in the future unless I add some sort of protection mod, and I really need ideas how to keep it minimal. Here&#39;s my plan so far:

• Allow citizens to set up their houses in a village that has TNT and creeper protection; Maybe even have like standard housing ready for players to move into.
• Inside the village, houses won&#39;t be protected with a mod, so their main function is as a spawn point, personal furnaces, unprotected chests (Probably for small amounts of iron, coal and other common blocks)
• Then if a player want&#39;s to store rare item&#39;s I am going to have one massive village bank, where players can buy protected chests for a diamond each
• The village will also have PVP off (If that is possible) 
• Once outside the village, anything goes, perhaps you can buy land from admins for like 1 diamond per 50 blocks of land, and chests outside the village for like 5 diamonds each.

Any better ideas? Also could people suggests mods for my needs?[/QUOTE]

 Oh god please no. Imagine how you would feel if you found a nice mountain out in the wilderness, and then you had to find several diamonds and wait for someone to come talk about it and take the diamonds just to build on it.

Anyway, just have people hide their shit, or install a plugin to log stuff like that."
