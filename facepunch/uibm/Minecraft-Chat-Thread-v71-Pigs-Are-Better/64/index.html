We&#39;re adding horses, guys!
&quot;I hate you! Pigs are a lot more fitting to minecraft&#39;s theme!&quot;

I never did understand that theme argument, unless minecraft&#39;s theme is supposed to be lazy development. Since Notch has left the team Jeb and Dinnerbone have really stepped up their game, though. Which is very good.

I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t do it, hell; I hope they do it. It&#39;s just that as a game developer you generally want as little bitching as possible because it really takes the fun out of your job. Keeping the majority of your players happy is very important.

Because of how the minecraft launcher for 1.6 works now modifying the .minecraft/bin doesn&#39;t work anymore. You need to modify the .jar inside the .minecraft/versions.

Or just use the Minecraft Forge installer and move Reis into the mods folder. Forge Modloader comes with Modloader after all."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Artix3;41916224]This is my biggest complaint with the new Forge client. You can&#39;t have seperate profiles with different mod setups, since the mods folder is shared between all profiles. It&#39;s not like MultiMC or MagicLauncher.[/QUOTE]
 
Why not? just make another profile in its own folder using the same forge, It works fine for me.</span>

Using the vanilla minecraft launcher profiles? Unless Forge changed something since I last looked it only has one global mods folder in the .minecraft folder and any forge profile will have every mod in that loaded.

As opposed to MultiMC which has different installations for the different instances of MC."
