This is an energy production system that requires literally NO energy to operate, it&#39;s all completely self-contained. Lava power? Still need a pump that requires power. Ethanol? Requires quite a bit of power to get started and to run all the machines that are required to make it. Netherstar generators? Dangerous and expensive. Solar power? Also expensive (won&#39;t even go into the OP Ultimate Solars, because generating reasonable power at night when all you have is the moon is complete and utter garbage) and only works during the day.
Well, this system ALSO works only during the day, but it stores excess energy in the form of a big-ass tank of Hydrogen that allows it to work even through the night and through rain. It&#39;s powering 12 36HP boilers which are each running 2 turbines (not shown in this pic), which are then powering multiple Massfabs (drainiest load I could think of, also not pictured in this image). It works so damned well because Activators require NO energy, and the Lilypad of Fertility REALLY boosts the growth speeds of the algae, though it&#39;s possible to make a setup just like this that&#39;s entirely passive, though will take up a TON more space."

                        <postrender input="It was funny at some point on profans server where there was a bug with power converters and factorization where the steam turbine from factorization would produce more energy than it consumed steam (the steam turbines where uncraftable though but me and nissehutt had 1 since before the update) so we hooked it up to itself and added an EU output aswell. We had to kick start it with a little bit of energy but after that it just steadily increased it outputs until it hit some sort of limit of how fast it could convert the energy (I want to say it produced ~2M EU/t at that point but don&#39;t quote me on that) :v:

[editline]27th May 2014[/editline]

I also built an interesting storage device with redpower (oh how I miss you :c) where I hooked up 2 transposer to eachother with tubes as well as 2 sortrons, one input and one output. I would put an item in teh input chest in front of the input sortron and run a command on the computer to either register a new item type or just suck everything from the chest into the tubes. The items then travelled in an endless cycle between the 2 transposers until you run another command to request an item type and quantity with the output sortron. All in all it was a machine with literally infinite storing capacity and the waiting time to pull items out of the network was at most a few seconds. All fitting in 7 blocks of space, excluding input/output inventories and computer cables.

Because Applied Energistics is for casuals:wink:"

                            <span v-pre>It was funny at some point on profans server where there was a bug with power converters and factorization where the steam turbine from factorization would produce more energy than it consumed steam (the steam turbines where uncraftable though but me and nissehutt had 1 since before the update) so we hooked it up to itself and added an EU output aswell. We had to kick start it with a little bit of energy but after that it just steadily increased it outputs until it hit some sort of limit of how fast it could convert the energy (I want to say it produced ~2M EU/t at that point but don&#39;t quote me on that) :v:

I also built an interesting storage device with redpower (oh how I miss you :c) where I hooked up 2 transposer to eachother with tubes as well as 2 sortrons, one input and one output. I would put an item in teh input chest in front of the input sortron and run a command on the computer to either register a new item type or just suck everything from the chest into the tubes. The items then travelled in an endless cycle between the 2 transposers until you run another command to request an item type and quantity with the output sortron. All in all it was a machine with literally infinite storing capacity and the waiting time to pull items out of the network was at most a few seconds. All fitting in 7 blocks of space, excluding input/output inventories and computer cables.

                            <span v-pre>Speaking of mods, seeing all these crappy /r/feedthebeast base tours makes me nostalgic for the good old days back when mods rewarded people for effort.
