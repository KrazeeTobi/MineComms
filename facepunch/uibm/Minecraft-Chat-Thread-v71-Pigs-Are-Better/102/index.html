Consider four areas of 100 blocks wide around the player. That is, 100*100*4, or 40,000 blocks. Let&#39;s pretend this is how much usually loads. You&#39;re proposing 400*400*4, or 640,000 blocks. This is 16 times the loading power. It isn&#39;t feasible.

[editline]10th November 2013[/editline]

Imagine having furnace carts with an inventory, the ability to refill them and the ability to link carts together. You could have a long (or small, that doesn&#39;t really matter) cargo trains going from one city to another (as long as there&#39;s a driver, as they would otherwise not get past unloaded chunks)[/QUOTE]
 
Furnace carts are among the most useless items in the game. In order to make it even useful anymore, they would have to add cart linking, a proper way to start/stop burning, as well as making it able to pull/push much more carts up hills than it currently can."

planning on naming the ship, but I don&#39;t know what to name it.

not that impressive, but it does it&#39;s job well.

I am gonna sail the ocean until I find some Millenaire colonies along with going to ruins and dungeons to get equipment, besides my starting stone tier tools, I won&#39;t be crafting anything, only trading for weapons and work with items I get from mobs, hoping it&#39;ll be interesting."

                            <span v-pre>Got bored, brainstormed, decided to reboot a old map i had laying in the catacombs of my SSD.  Shocking after 10+ versions it converted the map properly.

The idea was a huge mall like map that offered tons of mini games (Sadly most i had lined up are no longer being developed).  However thanks to bungeecord i can now hook up additional servers to add more and balance the load.</span>

Ethanol production line using nothing but a Steve&#39;s Carts oak tree farm, Natura berries and MFR Harvesters/Sludge Boiler.
There&#39;s 3 &quot;bush bricks&quot; of each berry type that can be squeezed into fruit juice, each measuring 7x15x6 (currently 6 high, planning on expanding to 10 high) with an equal height arrangement of MFR Harvesters with gold range upgrades (had a shitload of gold lying around so figured &quot;why not?&quot;). Berries are deposited into AE system which takes them to 2 Squeezers, with a 3rd for processing apples only from the tree farm (also for mulch). The fruit juice is then used to ferment saplings from the tree farm (using mulch instead of fertilizers, more renewable), then further processed in an array of 4 stills. Currently using ethanol to fuel a max-sized high-pressure boiler. When it started, I had about 800 buckets worth of ethanol stored up from a previous smaller setup that used a low-pressure boiler and some magmatic engines to power the setup (MUCH smaller bush and manual sapling/mulch feed), the HP boiler sucked it down to about 200 buckets worth, and as of this post is has gone back up to roughly 800 buckets worth being stored in a 5x5x7 Railcraft tank. The plan is to have at least 4 HP boilers running Industrial engines and an additional 2 powering a handful of steam turbines.
While so far it&#39;s proving to be a success, I can&#39;t say I&#39;d recommend it for everyone, as acquiring that many damned bushes takes a good deal of time and/or bonemeal. Thankfully there&#39;s the Watering Can. :v:"

If MF:R harvesters can harvest from Natura berry bushes, can they harvest from IndustrialCraft cropsticks? Greg&#39;s harvester only covers one stick. [del]And I don&#39;t know if this is also your field of knowledge, but have you any idea on how to work his new bronze blast furnace? I&#39;ve been trying to assemble it with bronze blocks and bronze plated bricks and if requires a power of some sort, it sure isn&#39;t steam.[/del]

Found the solution. I&#39;m a dummy and need to learn to read the books in the game. According to his book GregTech Manual I (4e), a single bronze blast furnace requires a hundred bronze [b]plates[/b] (or [i]two hundred bronze bars[/i], and the steam forge hammer still requires two bars per plate!) Early steel does not require coal dust, but coal itself. Where the coal dust goes in the industrial blast furnace, you put something burnable, like coal or coal coke. It uses two coal coke or four coal per ingot. Blocks of said coals will not work. Protip: If a mod author provides a written book involving their mod, read it because it may have updated."

Spiders can spawn with random positive potion effects. Invisibility is honestly one of the least harmful because you can still see their eyes - a Regen II spider isn&#39;t particuarly fun, and nor is a bugged one I found with Instant Health - you know, the one that if forced to last longer than a single tick (as spider potion effects last fucking ages if not forever) gives health back every single tick. Speed-boosted spiders are the most common, I believe.

I also found a Water-Breathing cave spider when that feature originally launched in a snapshot and trapped it in what is now an arachnian fishbowl."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=scratch (nl);42839743]Is it normal for some spiders to spawn with invisibility, because fuck this wasn&#39;t fun :v:

Spiders can spawn with random positive potion effects. Invisibility is honestly one of the least harmful because you can still see their eyes - a Regen II spider isn&#39;t particuarly fun, and nor is a bugged one I found with Instant Health - you know, the one that if forced to last longer than a single tick (as spider potion effects last fucking ages if not forever) gives health back every single tick. Speed-boosted spiders are the most common, I believe.

Oh god, I just noticed how much ships are strewn about around the island.
I count four from this image.

I am not sure which texture pack to use, I am trying to decide between Summerfield (Above) or Sphax purebdcraft (below)
