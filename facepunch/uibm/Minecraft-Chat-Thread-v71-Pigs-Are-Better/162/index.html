                        <postrender input="For the sake of bringing discussion to a dying subforum, [I]what 5 blocks or items would you like to see implemented in 1.9[/I]?

1.8 was my favourite update in ages (because it was the only update in ages, hurr) in terms of the stuff it brought with it. Banners might be my favourite thing of all, since they have purpose in decoration, faction building, and ownership - but it also gave us three new types of stone, slime blocks, everything in sea temples, armour stands, and the new styles of fence and doors. Here are my five answers, in rough order of &#39;simple&#39; to &#39;complex&#39; to implement.

[B]Chair[/B] - probably one of the first ever &#39;we need this&#39; blocks in minecraft, and somehow it&#39;s still not implemented in 2014. Boats aren&#39;t exactly an ideal workaround.

[B]Potion of Learning[/B] - a potion that gives 3/8 minutes of double experience. If I could choose the ingredient, I&#39;d use a sponge (to soak up knowledge, see), which would mean the potion-maker would need to have explored a nether fortress and a sea temple to get it. Perfect end-game item, and removes some of the grindiness of getting enchantments.

[B]Scarecrow[/B] - for attracting or repelling passive or harmful mobs. For use in mob farming, crowd control, and base protection. Perhaps have the effect change on the head used in the crafting recipe?
Melon - attract passive mobs, attract harmful ones.
Pumpkin - attract passive mobs, repel harmful ones.
Player head- repel passive mobs, attract harmful ones. (need to add a way to get these in game, too)
Creeper/zombie/skeleton head - repel passive mobs, repel harmful ones.

[B]Shelves[/B] - Another request that&#39;s been around for ages. 3D item frames with 4/9 slots, pretty much. It&#39;d make the shops I build less like warehouses and much nicer to look at.

[B]Binoculars[/B] - for spying on players/mobs/pretty terrain 100-200m away. Aesthetic and combative uses! Working out the rendering method would probably be a nightmare though, given how laggy it is at the moment for shorter distances."

                            <span v-pre>For the sake of bringing discussion to a dying subforum, [I]what 5 blocks or items would you like to see implemented in 1.9[/I]?

1.8 was my favourite update in ages (because it was the only update in ages, hurr) in terms of the stuff it brought with it. Banners might be my favourite thing of all, since they have purpose in decoration, faction building, and ownership - but it also gave us three new types of stone, slime blocks, everything in sea temples, armour stands, and the new styles of fence and doors. Here are my five answers, in rough order of &#39;simple&#39; to &#39;complex&#39; to implement.

[B]Chair[/B] - probably one of the first ever &#39;we need this&#39; blocks in minecraft, and somehow it&#39;s still not implemented in 2014. Boats aren&#39;t exactly an ideal workaround.

[B]Potion of Learning[/B] - a potion that gives 3/8 minutes of double experience. If I could choose the ingredient, I&#39;d use a sponge (to soak up knowledge, see), which would mean the potion-maker would need to have explored a nether fortress and a sea temple to get it. Perfect end-game item, and removes some of the grindiness of getting enchantments.

[B]Scarecrow[/B] - for attracting or repelling passive or harmful mobs. For use in mob farming, crowd control, and base protection. Perhaps have the effect change on the head used in the crafting recipe?
Melon - attract passive mobs, attract harmful ones.
Pumpkin - attract passive mobs, repel harmful ones.
Player head- repel passive mobs, attract harmful ones. (need to add a way to get these in game, too)
Creeper/zombie/skeleton head - repel passive mobs, repel harmful ones.

[B]Shelves[/B] - Another request that&#39;s been around for ages. 3D item frames with 4/9 slots, pretty much. It&#39;d make the shops I build less like warehouses and much nicer to look at.

[B]Binoculars[/B] - for spying on players/mobs/pretty terrain 100-200m away. Aesthetic and combative uses! Working out the rendering method would probably be a nightmare though, given how laggy it is at the moment for shorter distances.</span>

Basically, things like Chisel, Carpenter&#39;s Blocks, Thaumcraft, any mod that does any amount of indepth rendering, will most likely not make the effort to port over to 1.8.

Why?

Well basically, this is what you have to do to render a basic cauldron block.

I&#39;d try to understand something of it but it&#39;s blurry as fuck (I don&#39;t know java, though).
Anyway it looks like it&#39;s just code to assign textures to the right side of every polygon, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a utility done to convert a model into that ^ in less than  a week."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=dmillerw;46216293]I&#39;m just popping in to say it now, most of the mods y&#39;all love won&#39;t be around in 1.8. I&#39;ve been ranting about it on Twitter for about an hour now.

Basically, things like Chisel, Carpenter&#39;s Blocks, Thaumcraft, any mod that does any amount of indepth rendering, will most likely not make the effort to port over to 1.8.

Why?

Well basically, this is what you have to do to render a basic cauldron block.

If you can actually read that, good for you, but seriously. The amount of effort that goes in to it.

This new resource system for models has killed any advanced rendering we were able to do.[/QUOTE]
 
I&#39;d try to understand something of it but it&#39;s blurry as fuck (I don&#39;t know java, though).
Anyway it looks like it&#39;s just code to assign textures to the right side of every polygon, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have a utility done to convert a model into that ^ in less than  a week.</span>
