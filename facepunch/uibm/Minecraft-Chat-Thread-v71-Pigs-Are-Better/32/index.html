 Nyeh, that one&#39;s a little better, but it&#39;s still made of too many polygons, if you ask me.

Redpower can&#39;t be removed entirely, it&#39;s too big in ftb to be. She hasn&#39;t been working on it as much as she wishes due to real life things.

You can also just not update, you&#39;re not forced to. Just keep playing on 1.4.7 until everything is ready."

Well I would if I could. But like I said, I tried reverting to several of the earlier versions, and the same glitches are still happening.

And I don&#39;t know how they&#39;re going to keep Redpower in if it&#39;s not going to be updated to 1.5. The way I heard it, the dev doesn&#39;t have time to do that big of an update to the mod, but also doesn&#39;t want to turn control of the mod over to anyone else just yet. So there isn&#39;t really anything that anyone can do."

Redpower can&#39;t be removed entirely, it&#39;s too big in ftb to be. She hasn&#39;t been working on it as much as she wishes due to real life things.

You can also just not update, you&#39;re not forced to. Just keep playing on 1.4.7 until everything is ready.[/QUOTE]
 
Well I would if I could. But like I said, I tried reverting to several of the earlier versions, and the same glitches are still happening.

And I don&#39;t know how they&#39;re going to keep Redpower in if it&#39;s not going to be updated to 1.5. The way I heard it, the dev doesn&#39;t have time to do that big of an update to the mod, but also doesn&#39;t want to turn control of the mod over to anyone else just yet. So there isn&#39;t really anything that anyone can do.</span>

I hear RedPower 2 is going to be removed from the pack in the next update too, because the dev is no longer able to work on it. That&#39;s going to remove so much shit from my world, and I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s going to happen to things like volcanoes and marble, which are present in world-gen.

For cheap hosting, I&#39;ve had some good experiences with exodushosting.

I use a vps on ramnode to host my server though, it works quite well, but its more expensive.
