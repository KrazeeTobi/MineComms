The whole northern forest/swamp region is occupied by others, so that&#39;s the region yet to be named.

My castle is in the Hellas overlook region. It&#39;s an extreme hills terrain with my castle built on the cliff overlooking the sea.

                            <span v-pre>Since I last updated it, the give function of Never Enough Items apparently doesn&#39;t work in single player anymore. Granted I would have liked to have made a large&#39;ish house from the get go, having it function as just a recipe guide has actually been kind of fun. Like they say: you can only have stuff handed to you for so long before it gets boring.</span>

3 days late, but MineFactoryReloaded has a fantastic item called Safari Net, which you can capture any mobs with, kinda like a pokeball. You can capture villagers too, however to circumvent the right-click trade gui, you will need a Safari Net Launcher, which shoots the pokeball and captures the mob into the item. These items are inexpensive to make and you can find some in jungle/desert temples."

The single-user ones are inexpensive. The reusable ones are the only ones that can be used in an MF:R mob spawner and require Ender pearls and tear of Ghast. One use I can think of with the launcher is capturing an animal consumed by the taint from Thaumcraft and launch it at your foes. Or launch it over their walls, unleashing the foulness from the inside."

Well, playing in Beta 1.7.3 gives you a lot of experience with building stone structures without using stone brick. Might want to try it sometime. One of the most important things to remember is that all types of stone are shades of gray, which is the most difficult part to work with.

To start, I&#39;ve found that cobblestone is best used for foundation work. For example, I&#39;m currently building a council building on top of a sizeable hill, so I added a huge amount dirt to make a flat building area. The massive cube of dirt is pretty hideous, though, so I outlined it in cobble. However, it&#39;s a necessity to add alcoves to visually break up the texturing, or it will look like a giant box.

Regular stone is also important, and I generally use it for the basic structure of a building. You don&#39;t [I]always[/I] need to make the design too complex, though - stone has a pleasing look, and a lot of detail can be distracting to the eye. However, adding one-block recesses to hold torches is a good way to add light without spamming torches across the walls. Sculpting arches and vaults is a good idea for underground structures, too.

Surprisingly enough, glass is almost a necessity in my designs. Look at real-life windows - most of them are sunken into the surface of a building&#39;s walls, so do the same in Minecraft. Just be sure to add plenty of torches for when the sun goes down.

Finally, stone slabs are useful for broad details, like creating a facade or walkways.

They&#39;re improving them? How? They&#39;re all but entirely useless with the advent of powered rails, the only means of making them useful again would be the ability to link carts to them."

Now a furnace minecart can barely push anything other than a minecart with a player in it.

What&#39;s even worse is that they decided minecarts needed momentum, except they were too lazy to do it properly so now it&#39;s easier to push a filled minecart uphill than it is an empty minecart. That means if you want to send an empty minecart up a hill, you literally need every single rail to be a powered rail. What were they thinking? Did they even test it?"

                            <span v-pre>Furnace minecarts were useful until they &quot;revamped&quot; the minecart physics.
Now a furnace minecart can barely push anything other than a minecart with a player in it.

What&#39;s even worse is that they decided minecarts needed momentum, except they were too lazy to do it properly so now it&#39;s easier to push a filled minecart uphill than it is an empty minecart. That means if you want to send an empty minecart up a hill, you literally need every single rail to be a powered rail. What were they thinking? Did they even test it?</span>
