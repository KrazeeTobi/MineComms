                        <postrender input="Factions servers are literally the biggest bullshit I&#39;ve ever experienced in Minecraft.

Let&#39;s start my riveting tale of tears and unfairness.

On the server, there were three factions - Orange, Blue and Green. I was in the last one, and we did fairly good. But two days after the server&#39;s opening (yes, that short) everything began to fall apart.

We were being constantly robbed by someone. We decided to build a storage to place unwanted stuff there. They even stole that unwanted pile of items.
Our spawn got lava&#39;d, no chances of getting out of there. We were also being constantly accused of &quot;sending thieves, griefers and spies&quot; into other factions (complete bullshit, we didn&#39;t ever send anyone). At last we managed to get the admin to reroll our map after a few days. He also rerolled everything that belonged to members - so during the sixth day we were basically at Day 0. The admin also [i]declared a war of Greens and Blues.[/i] We were struggling to get an advantage - no result. Ores were disabled because of that retarded plugin that makes ores drop from stone at random. So we were basically screwed over - a rich map, but we couldn&#39;t get any of that. Also, there were no diamonds - you could only get them from the ingame Market (God only knows why this retarded thing of a system was introduced). The only way you could get money was from farming and selling items.

Our world didn&#39;t have a single piece of grass anywhere near the spawn. Also, no villages.

Aaand it was finally the last day - war time. Our faction&#39;s equipment consisted of iron armor, swords and all that.

Guess what the Blues had?

[i]Full diamond armor and equipment, complete with enchantments. Also, Golden Apples and Ender Pearls.[/i]

Needless to say, we got completely steamrolled.

When I complained to the admin that the fight was completely unfair, he just ignored me and said that I didn&#39;t do shit during the fight.
[i]Except I was the first one on the battlefield, the rest was just [u]too scared[/u] to move out of the spawn.[/i]
Now the Blues are admitting to using external scripts (&quot;calculations&quot;), making AFK Machines (God knows for what, but it&#39;s basically bypassing the Anti-Idle plugin) and many other unfair shit.

Best part?

[b]Even my ex-teammates are turning against me, just because they got convinced by the other factions that I am the cause of all evil.[/b]

Bonus points of douchebagness for the admin - the leader of the Blue Faction is his IRL friend. It explains why he did not give a shit about them playing dirty.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Factions servers consist of elitists, cheaters, scumbags and ignorant admins. Basically the worst kind of experience you can have in Minecraft.

[sp]Sorry if it&#39;s a wrong place to post it, but I just wanted to share the story and making another thread seems pointless imho.[/sp]"

Needless to say, we got completely steamrolled.

When I complained to the admin that the fight was completely unfair, he just ignored me and said that I didn&#39;t do shit during the fight.
[i]Except I was the first one on the battlefield, the rest was just [u]too scared[/u] to move out of the spawn.[/i]
Now the Blues are admitting to using external scripts (&quot;calculations&quot;), making AFK Machines (God knows for what, but it&#39;s basically bypassing the Anti-Idle plugin) and many other unfair shit.

Best part?

[b]Even my ex-teammates are turning against me, just because they got convinced by the other factions that I am the cause of all evil.[/b]

Bonus points of douchebagness for the admin - the leader of the Blue Faction is his IRL friend. It explains why he did not give a shit about them playing dirty.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Factions servers consist of elitists, cheaters, scumbags and ignorant admins. Basically the worst kind of experience you can have in Minecraft.

[sp]Sorry if it&#39;s a wrong place to post it, but I just wanted to share the story and making another thread seems pointless imho.[/sp]</span>

Encountered my first witch today. Oddly not from a hut, but out in a field, probably picking toadstools for some mean Witch&#39;s Br&#252;. I don&#39;t know how people manage it, this one&#39;s poisoned me many times, possibly with a Poison II potion. I&#39;ve tried whacking at it with a bronze cleaver and it still won&#39;t die. Maybe it was using something like Regeneration or Health. This is to be a reminder that despite my best bronze armor is at hand, the potency of potions is not to be underestimated.

PS. I can&#39;t seem to chug milk like I used to. I could [url=http://i.imgur.com/QIzJ0Od.png]dump it in the world[/url], but what good is it when it&#39;s not in my belly?

On a serious note, could flux be responsible for the spawning of a witch? Checking the wiki, a flux if Instrumentum is responsible for witches. But I haven&#39;t even cracked out a thaumonomicon yet. The bad news is that I probably live very close to a bad node and I&#39;ve already settled Keebler style. Explains all the wisps harassing me. In order to move out, I probably should start crafting some knapsacks and get going."

Encountered my first witch today. Oddly not from a hut, but out in a field, probably picking toadstools for some mean Witch&#39;s Br&#252;. I don&#39;t know how people manage it, this one&#39;s poisoned me many times, possibly with a Poison II potion. I&#39;ve tried whacking at it with a bronze cleaver and it still won&#39;t die. Maybe it was using something like Regeneration or Health. This is to be a reminder that despite my best bronze armor is at hand, the potency of potions is not to be underestimated.

PS. I can&#39;t seem to chug milk like I used to. I could [url=http://i.imgur.com/QIzJ0Od.png]dump it in the world[/url], but what good is it when it&#39;s not in my belly?

[editline]editline[/editline]

On a serious note, could flux be responsible for the spawning of a witch? Checking the wiki, a flux if Instrumentum is responsible for witches. But I haven&#39;t even cracked out a thaumonomicon yet. The bad news is that I probably live very close to a bad node and I&#39;ve already settled Keebler style. Explains all the wisps harassing me. In order to move out, I probably should start crafting some knapsacks and get going.</span>

I&#39;ve been running a small server on a computer that worked perfectly fine during 1.3.2 or so, but now the lag is unbearable. It&#39;s not my network, because the server and my computer are literally side by side, yet I still experience lag. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s due to the Bukkit development build either, but I don&#39;t have much choice in the matter, as the Bukkit devs are taking their sweet-ass time releasing a recommended build.

Any advice?

I heard something about the new increased zombie range causing the lag, but I&#39;m not sure about that either."

                            <span v-pre>Damn, is there something wrong with the Minecraft server software? Sounds are delayed, blocks reappear occasionally, mobs sometimes refuse to attack altogether, and I&#39;m constantly getting warning messages about the server being overloaded.

I&#39;ve been running a small server on a computer that worked perfectly fine during 1.3.2 or so, but now the lag is unbearable. It&#39;s not my network, because the server and my computer are literally side by side, yet I still experience lag. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s due to the Bukkit development build either, but I don&#39;t have much choice in the matter, as the Bukkit devs are taking their sweet-ass time releasing a recommended build.

Any advice?

I heard something about the new increased zombie range causing the lag, but I&#39;m not sure about that either.</span>

If one of those is around, they always contain a Dark node which continually creates flux, so you either need to deal with it and work towards thaumcraft endgame, eventually removing the node and mostly curing your flux, or move.[/QUOTE]

I checked and I know about the dark nodes these things contain. Nothing like that close enough. Plus if there was one there, it would be keeping the wisps locked up instead of prancing about and flying through my farm windows. They stole a pumpkin pie I had cooling on the windowsill once. Plus I already moved out of the area since I&#39;m not going to deal with this constantly.
