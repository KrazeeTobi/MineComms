                        <postrender input="Fellow Facepunch/Minecraft folks, I present to you a vanilla redstone conundrum.

So I built this somewhat long underground minecart system to transport myself safely between three destinations (let&#39;s just call them A, B, and C).  At one point in the system, the tracks all meet at a three-way intersection.  I built a control room at destination A equipped with two redstone lamps to indicate where the junction was set to lead the mine cart, and I planned to do this at the other two destinations as well.  I also planned to allow the junction to be altered at any one of the destinations, to facilitate travel from each.

Now, silly redstone-impaired me thought that this would be simple.  I thought I could simply flip a redstone torch on and off to get the track to orient in the correct directions.  Unfortunately, I forgot about the south-east rule, and I also forgot that I have no idea how to use redstone circuits.  It turns out logic gates are much simpler in theory than in a game world with physical limitations (Wiremod was way easier than this).

After a few minutes trying to figure out this mystical south-east phenomenon, I ended up building the intersection as a ring, with a single empty block in the middle.  One redstone torch was placed under each turn, making three in total - the correct combination would have to be set to reach the desired destination.  The redstone lamps in the control rooms would indicate when the correct setup was made via buttons.  [I]In theory[/I], this design should work.  I know that I need to use some sort of latch system to allow for buttons from all three control rooms to correctly toggle the redstone torches regardless of source.  I also need some kind of two-way repeater system that both sends signal to the torches and reads the output of them for the lamps.  In the case that I added a fourth destination, I would also need to know how to negate input to the lamps because this fourth place would have a turn in the middle of another already-made rail.  However, I simply have no idea how to put it all together - how do I make the needed circuitry?

I made a crude MS Paint drawing to attempt to illustrate this predicament.

After a few minutes trying to figure out this mystical south-east phenomenon, I ended up building the intersection as a ring, with a single empty block in the middle.  One redstone torch was placed under each turn, making three in total - the correct combination would have to be set to reach the desired destination.  The redstone lamps in the control rooms would indicate when the correct setup was made via buttons.  [I]In theory[/I], this design should work.  I know that I need to use some sort of latch system to allow for buttons from all three control rooms to correctly toggle the redstone torches regardless of source.  I also need some kind of two-way repeater system that both sends signal to the torches and reads the output of them for the lamps.  In the case that I added a fourth destination, I would also need to know how to negate input to the lamps because this fourth place would have a turn in the middle of another already-made rail.  However, I simply have no idea how to put it all together - how do I make the needed circuitry?

I made a crude MS Paint drawing to attempt to illustrate this predicament.

Instead of having an overworld minecart system (unless that&#39;s what you want), you can use the nether to cut the distance by a factor of 8, then the redstone requirements would be fewer.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=rinoaff33;41809238]Fellow Facepunch/Minecraft folks, I present to you a vanilla redstone conundrum.

So I built this somewhat long underground minecart system to transport myself safely between three destinations (let&#39;s just call them A, B, and C).  At one point in the system, the tracks all meet at a three-way intersection.  I built a control room at destination A equipped with two redstone lamps to indicate where the junction was set to lead the mine cart, and I planned to do this at the other two destinations as well.  I also planned to allow the junction to be altered at any one of the destinations, to facilitate travel from each.

Now, silly redstone-impaired me thought that this would be simple.  I thought I could simply flip a redstone torch on and off to get the track to orient in the correct directions.  Unfortunately, I forgot about the south-east rule, and I also forgot that I have no idea how to use redstone circuits.  It turns out logic gates are much simpler in theory than in a game world with physical limitations (Wiremod was way easier than this).

After a few minutes trying to figure out this mystical south-east phenomenon, I ended up building the intersection as a ring, with a single empty block in the middle.  One redstone torch was placed under each turn, making three in total - the correct combination would have to be set to reach the desired destination.  The redstone lamps in the control rooms would indicate when the correct setup was made via buttons.  [I]In theory[/I], this design should work.

I also need some kind of two-way repeater system that both sends signal to the torches and reads the output of them for the lamps.  In the case that I added a fourth destination, I would also need to know how to negate input to the lamps because this fourth place would have a turn in the middle of another already-made rail.
