Personally I prefer modded Minecraft because it adds all sorts of shit that tickles my tinkering fancy, though I understand that sometimes it&#39;s just a tad too over-whelming for some trying to figure out what X ore does and what Machine #21 is supposed to do.[/QUOTE]
 
[QUOTE=Jrose14;45215424]True, its just mine diamonds to use to go get more diamonds.

You could always do fun events and stuff though. Do community mega-projects, like build a giant castle, or play games like spleef (if thats still a thing people like), Bomberman, etc.[/QUOTE]

man. i&#39;m cheap as fuck but if i&#39;m backed into a corner then i guess i&#39;ll have to help pay the fee. a better option for me at least would be to wait until 1.8, maybe vanilla servers will come back then. who knows when that will be though

man. i&#39;m cheap as fuck but if i&#39;m backed into a corner then i guess i&#39;ll have to help pay the fee. a better option for me at least would be to wait until 1.8, maybe vanilla servers will come back then. who knows when that will be though

I like building, but after a while I know that what I build isn&#39;t going to last or serve true function, or be as good as the guy over there will build. I used to build for a friends server, a big thing he wanted to make into a survival/RPG server, but we eventually gave up and all of my work went away, and I think that may have spoiled the appeal for me a bit. A few months he asked me to do a favor for him and make in a big beautiful map in worldpainter, which I was happy to. He wanted to make a new RPG server over a few months, but eventually, after working for hours of the map he wanted, he canned it too because of college stuff.

If I could build for an actual purpose that wouldn&#39;t get tossed out the window at some point (which is why I hate 2b2t, besides the lag of course) then I might enjoy myself in vanilla more."

What&#39;s to maintain? I&#39;ve run vanilla/mostly vanilla servers for months before without problems, even on the unstable and glitchy snapshot builds (and snapshots can&#39;t run spigot, which is dozens of times more stable). There are minimal mods, and I&#39;d like to OP a few people who can take care of minor problems should they arise. Whether or not I&#39;m active on the server has no bearing on how frequently I&#39;ll be able to add people to the whitelist, and other mundane tasks.

Even if there is a catastrophic problem, I have daily backups that are stored for a week via crontab. I can make them occur every 6 hours if people really feel that it is necessary.



Anyways:

The server ip 172.245.215.45 and it is up. I am currently running on the latest stable spigot build. The world border is a square centered at 0,0 where the edges are 5k out (so 10k square in total). The nether is the same with the edges being 625 out from 0,0 (1/8th), and the end is 500 out from 0,0.

Are people interested in having a map? I am thinking about setuping up overviewer and having it dump the contents of the world to [URL]http://172.245.215.45/map[/URL] or something similar automatically, unless people have a strong preference for using dynmap. I personally prefer overviewer over dynmap because it has [I]significantly[/I] higher quality isometric rendering.

I just need names to whitelist at this point.

Even if there is a catastrophic problem, I have daily backups that are stored for a week via crontab. I can make them occur every 6 hours if people really feel that it is necessary.



Anyways:

The server ip 172.245.215.45 and it is up. I am currently running on the latest stable spigot build. The world border is a square centered at 0,0 where the edges are 5k out (so 10k square in total). The nether is the same with the edges being 625 out from 0,0 (1/8th), and the end is 500 out from 0,0.

Are people interested in having a map? I am thinking about setuping up overviewer and having it dump the contents of the world to [URL]http://172.245.215.45/map[/URL] or something similar automatically, unless people have a strong preference for using dynmap. I personally prefer overviewer over dynmap because it has [I]significantly[/I] higher quality isometric rendering.

I just need names to whitelist at this point.

Finally, do people want voice chat? It&#39;s pretty trivial for me to create another TS3 virtual server since I&#39;m using 2 of the 10 virtual server slots I have available at the moment, and I know I haven&#39;t not gone over 50 out of the 512 users I can have more than a handful of times."

The default render settings have the shadows so dark it&#39;s impossible to see anything, and while that&#39;s &quot;accurate&quot; it&#39;s not really useful to have on a map, and fullbright, or even just block based lighting both look dumb as hell.

Finally, do people want voice chat? It&#39;s pretty trivial for me to create another TS3 virtual server since I&#39;m using 2 of the 10 virtual server slots I have available at the moment, and I know I haven&#39;t not gone over 50 out of the 512 users I can have more than a handful of times.[/QUOTE]
 
May I ask which country the server is based in? I would be interested but I don&#39;t know how bad the connection might be.</span>

Even if there is a catastrophic problem, I have daily backups that are stored for a week via crontab. I can make them occur every 6 hours if people really feel that it is necessary.



Anyways:

The server ip 172.245.215.45 and it is up. I am currently running on the latest stable spigot build. The world border is a square centered at 0,0 where the edges are 5k out (so 10k square in total). The nether is the same with the edges being 625 out from 0,0 (1/8th), and the end is 500 out from 0,0.

Are people interested in having a map? I am thinking about setuping up overviewer and having it dump the contents of the world to [URL]http://172.245.215.45/map[/URL] or something similar automatically, unless people have a strong preference for using dynmap. I personally prefer overviewer over dynmap because it has [I]significantly[/I] higher quality isometric rendering.

I just need names to whitelist at this point.
