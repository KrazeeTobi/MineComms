OpenVZ is container based virtualisation while KVM is &quot;full virtualisation&quot;. Instead of spending a few minutes going into details I&#39;ll c/p a post from WHT here.

[url]http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=8922937&amp;postcount=5[/url]

[quote=Manndude@WHT]OpenVZ is easier, and often oversold. Some providers manage this better than others, however some providers use OpenVZ to sell 300GB of RAM on a machine with 32GB -actual- RAM. (Yes, this has happened).

OpenVZ isn&#39;t as secure as KVM. If someone has access to the VPS node, they can easily enter your VPS by using the vzctl enter CTID command (where &#39;CTID&#39; is your container ID). Shouldn&#39;t be an issue from a trustworthy provider, but worth noting.

OpenVZ, assuming not oversold to death, can be slightly faster than KVM. Will you feel the difference? Maybe, but probably not. It&#39;s &#39;lighter&#39; and doesn&#39;t require as much hostnode resources.

KVM is more tamper proof, and more like managing a &#39;real&#39; server.

With KVM, you can utilize full disk encryption, which is a plus for those seeking an added level of security.

With KVM you can use SELinux, on OpenVZ you can not. (Unless this has changed)

KVM is generally more &#39;premium&#39; than OpenVZ and slightly more expensive due to it not being oversold, or as oversold as OpenVZ. This means you should have a more stable service, without being impacted by your neighbors as much as you would with OpenVZ.

At Afterburst we don&#39;t overload either KVM or OpenVZ nodes so really its down to personal preference. For minecraft you won&#39;t really notice the difference."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=RaptorRed;45695680]Whats the difference between OpenVZ and KVM?[/QUOTE]
 
OpenVZ is container based virtualisation while KVM is &quot;full virtualisation&quot;. Instead of spending a few minutes going into details I&#39;ll c/p a post from WHT here.

[url]http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showpost.php?p=8922937&amp;postcount=5[/url]

[quote=Manndude@WHT]OpenVZ is easier, and often oversold. Some providers manage this better than others, however some providers use OpenVZ to sell 300GB of RAM on a machine with 32GB -actual- RAM. (Yes, this has happened).

OpenVZ isn&#39;t as secure as KVM. If someone has access to the VPS node, they can easily enter your VPS by using the vzctl enter CTID command (where &#39;CTID&#39; is your container ID). Shouldn&#39;t be an issue from a trustworthy provider, but worth noting.

OpenVZ, assuming not oversold to death, can be slightly faster than KVM. Will you feel the difference? Maybe, but probably not. It&#39;s &#39;lighter&#39; and doesn&#39;t require as much hostnode resources.

KVM is more tamper proof, and more like managing a &#39;real&#39; server.

With KVM, you can utilize full disk encryption, which is a plus for those seeking an added level of security.

With KVM you can use SELinux, on OpenVZ you can not. (Unless this has changed)

KVM is generally more &#39;premium&#39; than OpenVZ and slightly more expensive due to it not being oversold, or as oversold as OpenVZ. This means you should have a more stable service, without being impacted by your neighbors as much as you would with OpenVZ.

[url=https://github.com/superjamie/minecraft-init-script/blob/master/README]This[/url] is a good enough tutorial to get things working. I personally use a fairly heavily modified version of this script. The basic script there has everything you need to have a server running, have simple commands to start/stop/restart/provide info, and have automated backups/restarts/whatever else.

Any 1 gig VPS plan will be plenty for 10 people. You could probably get by with half a gig, but might run into some problems from time to time if you don&#39;t decrease the draw distance. A 1 gig plan is ~8 dollars a month on Ramnode and Afterburst, and you should never have a problem with either. Just allocate 800MB to minecraft in the startup line and it shouldn&#39;t be a problem.

Mods obviously increase resource requirements, but the amount will vary depending on the mod. My recommendation would be to go with a half gig premium SSD plan from ramnode (just pay yearly, you save a little), and if you need more, you can just bump it up to 1 gig from the control panel, and then they send you an invoice for the difference.

I could walk you through setting stuff up if you wanted. It&#39;s mostly very simple stuff. Tweak a couple settings in the config, Yum/aptget/whatever to install a bunch of shit, Drag and drop a few files with an ftp client, chmod a couple things, and then setting up your cron jobs for backups. After that you basically just set it and forget it."

Our OpenVZ sale prices are still on actually - though that&#39;s not advertised either (we&#39;re a bit low on stock at the moment) - 25% off list price recurring (except super-micro).[/QUOTE]
 
Aren&#39;t your super micro plans limited to 50 Mb/s? 5GB of disc space won&#39;t hold a moderate world + a week of backups, let alone bloated mods, and that little bandwidth could easily be an issue if you run dynmap/overviewer.

Not to be a dick or anything, but most of your lower end plans are just absolutely crushed by ramnode in terms of pricing and what you get. The half gig plan has more storage space, more than your fair use network policy, is cheaper, has gigabit, 2 cores, and they tell you what kind of chips you get, etc."
