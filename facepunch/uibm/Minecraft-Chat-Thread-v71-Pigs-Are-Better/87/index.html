Quarried Stone makes a fine replacement for marble, but not in the case of GregTech. Back on Profan&#39;s FTB Ultimate, we needed some flint dust for ITNT, instead of bothering with gravel, we used our basalt stash to electrolyze basalt dust.

Just done a quick test, a bunch of spider jockeys in a field, I splash myself with an invisiblity potion and swap to survival. The spiders just wandered as they do, the skeletons began shooting and a creeper also in the field exploded everything.[/QUOTE]
 
Which is odd, &#39;cause spiders usually follow you around despite not being able to see you (such as through walls and such). Which makes sense, seeing as spiders sense vibrations."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=ReligiousNutjob;42283597]Has anyone else been noticing that since 1.6, Invisibility potions have no effect on most mobs anymore? All the changes they made to mob targeting and pathfinding, Creepers, Zombies and Skeletons completely ignore invisibility potions.

Spiders, the things that have been unchanged since Alpha are the only ones that actually work right and can&#39;t see invisible people.

Once again, not quite what I meant. Not my stuff being stolen, but quite literally, things I create. Maps, mods, so on. I&#39;ve never created my own mods, but I&#39;ve heard plenty of cases of them being stolen, or put into modpacks without permission, or so on. But what I do make is maps most of the time, and I&#39;m just sick to shit of them being stolen."

[editline]24th September 2013[/editline]

I think most whitelisted servers are more decent than public ones in that regard.[/QUOTE]
 
Once again, not quite what I meant. Not my stuff being stolen, but quite literally, things I create. Maps, mods, so on. I&#39;ve never created my own mods, but I&#39;ve heard plenty of cases of them being stolen, or put into modpacks without permission, or so on. But what I do make is maps most of the time, and I&#39;m just sick to shit of them being stolen.</span>
