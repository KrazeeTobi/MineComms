Minecraft currently has 4 gamemodes.

Survival:
The player has to actually gather resources to build. The player can take damage and die, they also have to eat to fill their hunger bar.

Creative:
The player has infinite resources. They can fly around and build to their hearts content without having to worry about hunger or death.

Hardcore:
Hardcore is the same as survival with a few changes. All mobs do more damage. The player can actually die from starvation. The player has ONE LIFE. After dying the player does not respawn and the world is deleted. On Hardcore multiplayer servers the player is banned after death.

Adventure:
Meant for player created maps. Adventure mode disables the ability to destroy most blocks without the proper tools, ie. an axe for wood. This mode was meant to be amazing, but actually ended up being pretty god awful.


Minecraft has quite a history, progressing from Survival Test, to InDev, to InfDev, to Alpha, to Beta, to the current &quot;Full Release&quot; version, and it&#39;s STILL being updated.

MOBS

Mobs are creatures that roam the generated terrain of every level. They can range from nice pigs to green dicks that blow up your shit.
There are currently 22 mobs in Survival Mode, with 7 of them being passive.

Friendly mobs:

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/3/32/MooshroomFace.png[/img]Mooshroom:
- Mooshrooms are creepy red Cows with mushrooms on their back. They exist only in Mushroom biomes and can be sheared to produce red mushrooms.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/d/d3/Villagerhead.png[/img]Villager:
- Villagers are Squidward-looking guys are found in villages across the world. They have several different occupations including librarian, farmer and blacksmith. They can trade you goodies for your emeralds. They react positively to you agreeing to trades and negatively to you attacking them.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/5/59/Snowgolemhead.png[/img]Snow Golem:
- Snow Golems can be crafted by players. They are little snowmen that wander around leaving a trail of snow behind them. They throw snowballs at enemies, but unfortunately, the snowballs do absolutely no damage.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/0/03/PigFace.png[/img]Pigs:
- Pigs are friendly mobs. They may seem cute, but not everyone lives forever. So you&#39;ll have to kill such adorable creatures for their delicious bacon to fill your hunger bar.
If one is struck by lightning it will turn into a Zombie Pigman. They can also be ridden if you put a saddle on them.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/b/b1/SheepFace.png[/img]Sheep:
- Sheep are just as adorable as pigs. You can kill them to get one wool, or if you craft shears (2 iron) you can get up to 3 wool off of them. If sheared, they will re-grow wool by eating grass.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/9/93/CowFace.png[/img]Cows:
- Cows seem friendly and look pretty stupid; But these mobs may drop up to 0-3 leather, which can be crafted into really crappy armor. They also drop delicious steak and can be milked using a bucket to make equally delicious cake.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/5/53/ChickenFace.png[/img]Chickens:
- Chickens may look like ducks, but try not to get them confused too much. Chickens drop 0-2 feathers when killed and crap out eggs every 5-10 minutes, these eggs can be used to make cake or thrown to make baby chickens.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/1/14/Squidface.png[/img]Squid:
- Squid are awkward-looking mobs that swim around in water and in many cases on land or even in the air. They drop ink sacks that can be used to dye wool.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/6/60/OcelotFace.png[/img]Ocelot:
- Ocelots are jungle cats. They can be tamed by giving them fish, thus turning them into cute wittle putty cats.

Neutral mobs:

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/2/2d/EndermanFace.png[/img]Enderman:
- These creepy fuckers wander around in the night picking up blocks. If you look them in the eye, they become hostile and will teleport around trying to kill you. They die in water. They can drop Ender Pearls which can be used to teleport and crafted into Eyes of Ender.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/d/d1/ZombiePigmanFace.png[/img]Pig Zombies:
- Pig Zombies, or Zombie Pigmen if you prefer, were added in during the Halloween Update. Though they can only be found in the Nether, they are completely friendly (until you disturb them by attacking them).

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/6/68/WolfFace.png[/img]Wolves:
- Wolves are a tamable mob. Attack one and it&#39;ll most definitely fuck your shit up. Give it some treats and you&#39;ll have a partner that will help you rape some creepers.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/1/13/Vg_face.png[/img]Iron Golem:
-Iron Golems are found in large villages. They can also be crafted by the player with 4 iron blocks and a pumpkin. They protect villagers from zombies and players that dare to hurt them. Upon death they drop iron ingots and roses.

Enemy mobs:
[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/b/b2/ZombieFace.png[/img]Zombies:
- Zombies looks like they&#39;re ready to hug, right? Well try not to get too close, because these fuckers pack a punch.They drop rotten flesh which can give you a bad case of food poisoning. When it turns day, they begin to burn (there must be no blocks above them, even leaves).

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/d/dc/SkeletonFace.png[/img]Skeletons:
- These assholes like to shoot arrows at you from anywhere when they&#39;re close to you. Do NOT get trapped in a pit with Skeletons above you. When killed, they drop 0-2 arrows and/or 0-3 bones. In rare cases they can drop bows too. Just like Zombies, they burn as well when it&#39;s day.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/0/05/SpiderFace.png[/img]Spiders:
- Spiders lurk anywhere, and are ready to jump at you whenever. They climb walls and can make their way into your house if you don&#39;t have a full roof. They can be a big pain in the ass, especially when there are more than one. When killed, they drop 0-2 String and 0-1 Spider Eye. But with Spiders, they do not start on fire, most of the time they become friendly, making nice house guests.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/c/ca/SlimeFace.png[/img]Slimes:
- Slimes are very adorable mobs, even if they are unfriendly. Slimes can range from small to very large; the smallest slimes don&#39;t hurt you, so you can have them follow you and keep them as a pet! When they are killed, they usually drop 0-2 slime balls which are used to make Sticky Pistons.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/5/5e/CreeperFace.png[/img]Creepers:
- Fucking Creepers.These gigantic faggot dicks are the epiphany of why we all hate this game at times. They can be lurking ANYWHERE - even more concealed than spiders, and jump at you and blow up for no reason. They may seem like they need a hug (like Zombies) but be careful - they will destroy your shit. And what makes it worse is that they do NOT burn in daylight. But they drop 0-3 gunpowder when they are killed normally (not blown up) that can be crafted with sand to create TNT. If these guys get struck by lightning, god help you.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/7/70/GhastFace.png[/img]Ghasts:
- Ghasts were added in during the Halloween Update. These large, white, box-like, annoying fuckers shoot fireballs at you from wherever they are floating, even if you aren&#39;t that close. Thank god Notch fixed them from crying so much when on fire, you&#39;d probably quit playing the game when it happened.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/3/31/Blaze_Face.png[/img]Blaze:
- Blazes spawn in Nether Fortresses. They can fly and shoot fire charges at the player, making them a real danger. They drop Blaze Rods upon death.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/6/6b/CaveSpiderFace.png[/img]Cave Spider:
- Cave Spiders is only found in Abandoned Mineshafts. If you thought normal spiders were bad, these are worse. They act just like spiders, but can hit the player with poison that sucks the life right out of them. They drop string and spider eyes.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/0/09/Magma_Cube_Face.png[/img]Magma Cubes:
- Magma Cubes are similar to Slimes, except they only spawn in the Nether. Upon death they drop Magma Cream, which is essential to brewing potions of fire-resistance.

[img][/img]Silverfish:
- Silverfish are small termite-like creatures. They can pop out of blocks upon being broken and swarm the player. They are difficult to hit and create a large nuisance for any player that is unfortunate enough to come across them.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/4/41/SilverfishFace.png[/img]Witch: First mob to have physics to it&#39;s model. Tosses potions to harm and drinks potions to heal.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/1/1d/WitherSkeletonHead.png[/img]Wither Skeletons: A melee skeleton only found in the Nether. They drop Wither Skeleton Skulls that are used to spawn the Wither. Applies the same Withering effect as the Wither.

Bosses

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/4/48/Enderdragon_Face.png[/img]Enderdragon:
- The Enderdragon is a big gigantic dragon found in the end. Sure fucks up your day if you don&#39;t expect him to be in the end, but defeating him earns you a nice xp bonus and the end of the game.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/8/84/WitherFace.png[/img]Wither: The Wither is spawned anywhere by the player. He&#39;ll fuck you up if you aren&#39;t prepared and is the first boss mob to attack other mobs.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/6/68/WolfFace.png[/img]Wolves:
- Wolves are a tamable mob. Attack one and it&#39;ll most definitely fuck your shit up. Give it some treats and you&#39;ll have a partner that will help you rape some creepers.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/1/13/Vg_face.png[/img]Iron Golem:
-Iron Golems are found in large villages. They can also be crafted by the player with 4 iron blocks and a pumpkin. They protect villagers from zombies and players that dare to hurt them. Upon death they drop iron ingots and roses.

Enemy mobs:
[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/b/b2/ZombieFace.png[/img]Zombies:
- Zombies looks like they&#39;re ready to hug, right? Well try not to get too close, because these fuckers pack a punch.They drop rotten flesh which can give you a bad case of food poisoning. When it turns day, they begin to burn (there must be no blocks above them, even leaves).

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/d/dc/SkeletonFace.png[/img]Skeletons:
- These assholes like to shoot arrows at you from anywhere when they&#39;re close to you. Do NOT get trapped in a pit with Skeletons above you. When killed, they drop 0-2 arrows and/or 0-3 bones. In rare cases they can drop bows too. Just like Zombies, they burn as well when it&#39;s day.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/0/05/SpiderFace.png[/img]Spiders:
- Spiders lurk anywhere, and are ready to jump at you whenever. They climb walls and can make their way into your house if you don&#39;t have a full roof. They can be a big pain in the ass, especially when there are more than one. When killed, they drop 0-2 String and 0-1 Spider Eye. But with Spiders, they do not start on fire, most of the time they become friendly, making nice house guests.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/c/ca/SlimeFace.png[/img]Slimes:
- Slimes are very adorable mobs, even if they are unfriendly. Slimes can range from small to very large; the smallest slimes don&#39;t hurt you, so you can have them follow you and keep them as a pet! When they are killed, they usually drop 0-2 slime balls which are used to make Sticky Pistons.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/5/5e/CreeperFace.png[/img]Creepers:
- Fucking Creepers.These gigantic faggot dicks are the epiphany of why we all hate this game at times. They can be lurking ANYWHERE - even more concealed than spiders, and jump at you and blow up for no reason. They may seem like they need a hug (like Zombies) but be careful - they will destroy your shit. And what makes it worse is that they do NOT burn in daylight. But they drop 0-3 gunpowder when they are killed normally (not blown up) that can be crafted with sand to create TNT. If these guys get struck by lightning, god help you.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/7/70/GhastFace.png[/img]Ghasts:
- Ghasts were added in during the Halloween Update. These large, white, box-like, annoying fuckers shoot fireballs at you from wherever they are floating, even if you aren&#39;t that close. Thank god Notch fixed them from crying so much when on fire, you&#39;d probably quit playing the game when it happened.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/3/31/Blaze_Face.png[/img]Blaze:
- Blazes spawn in Nether Fortresses. They can fly and shoot fire charges at the player, making them a real danger. They drop Blaze Rods upon death.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/6/6b/CaveSpiderFace.png[/img]Cave Spider:
- Cave Spiders is only found in Abandoned Mineshafts. If you thought normal spiders were bad, these are worse. They act just like spiders, but can hit the player with poison that sucks the life right out of them. They drop string and spider eyes.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/0/09/Magma_Cube_Face.png[/img]Magma Cubes:
- Magma Cubes are similar to Slimes, except they only spawn in the Nether. Upon death they drop Magma Cream, which is essential to brewing potions of fire-resistance.

[img][/img]Silverfish:
- Silverfish are small termite-like creatures. They can pop out of blocks upon being broken and swarm the player. They are difficult to hit and create a large nuisance for any player that is unfortunate enough to come across them.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/4/41/SilverfishFace.png[/img]Witch: First mob to have physics to it&#39;s model. Tosses potions to harm and drinks potions to heal.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/1/1d/WitherSkeletonHead.png[/img]Wither Skeletons: A melee skeleton only found in the Nether. They drop Wither Skeleton Skulls that are used to spawn the Wither. Applies the same Withering effect as the Wither.

Bosses

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/4/48/Enderdragon_Face.png[/img]Enderdragon:
- The Enderdragon is a big gigantic dragon found in the end. Sure fucks up your day if you don&#39;t expect him to be in the end, but defeating him earns you a nice xp bonus and the end of the game.

[img]http://media-mcw.cursecdn.com/8/84/WitherFace.png[/img]Wither: The Wither is spawned anywhere by the player. He&#39;ll fuck you up if you aren&#39;t prepared and is the first boss mob to attack other mobs.
