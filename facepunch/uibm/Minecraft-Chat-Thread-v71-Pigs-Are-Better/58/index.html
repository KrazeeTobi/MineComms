Mojang probably spends most of their time these days rewriting/fixing Notch code to make the game more moddable/stable in the future."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=RocketRacer;41787275][B]This.[/B] I&#39;ve seen the &quot;tour around Mojang office&quot;(posted here as well) and holy shit, their office is so fucking expensive, but they don&#39;t really do shit. Minecraft - rare and minor updates, and even a lazy one[I](horses)[/I]; Minecraft PE - [I]really[/I] rare updates, and small amount of content; Scrolls - don&#39;t really care but apparently they have done a good job with it; Cobalt - is anyone actually interested in it?

Why can&#39;t Notch, Jeb_, Dinnerbone and everyone-else-that-are-working-on-MC-right-now collaborate and make some reasonable updates that will please us, instead of separating on multiple projects?

Meanwhile a modder have made a fucking Lua inside a game.[/QUOTE]
 
Modders don&#39;t have to worry about general stability, testing features on a lot of configurations, making sure things don&#39;t cause the game to be unplayable on low-end systems, not to mention the fact that most mods are filled with bad code. Mojang probably spends most of their time these days rewriting/fixing Notch code to make the game more moddable/stable in the future.</span>
