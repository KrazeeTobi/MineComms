ok so don&#39;t post on mc forums and you can completely avoid that &quot;nuisance&quot;. you&#39;re literally saying &quot;i don&#39;t like kids in games because if you&#39;re young you&#39;re obviously a lesser being or some shit&quot;

You can&#39;t deny that most 12 year olds are terrible to play with. I&#39;ve seen mature 12 year olds, but they&#39;re few and far in between. And what I&#39;m saying is, It&#39;s hard to find a pure survival server, and when you go to somewhere where they can be found like the Minecraft Forums, it&#39;s loaded with STUPID (Not mature) 12 year olds who make crappy parkour courses, build crappy square houses, and make terrible pewdiepieand Tobuscus references (diamond sword oh god).

He&#39;s saying he doesn&#39;t like immature acting 12 year olds because he finds them annoying, what&#39;s your problem? No, age doesn&#39;t guarantee maturity - but older people tend to be more mature. Immature people are annoying regardless of age, but the proportion of 10-12 year olds that act immature is much higher than that of lets say 16-18 year olds."

So you want a &quot;pure&quot; Minecraft server that isn&#39;t anarchy and has no PVP. As someone who used to host such a server, do you have ANY idea how much of a pain in the ass it is to host such a thing? &quot;Mature community like FP&quot;? Most of the trouble-makers I had were FROM FP. You&#39;d have the cunts that would build &quot;islands&quot; out of dirt a whole 6 blocks from shore, assholes who would use up all the materials in the public warehouse and then never log in again until a few days later when the stores were refilled, and idiots who would rather waste time making cobble generators rather than just go down in the mines where they not only get LOADS of cobble, but also shit-tons of USEFUL materials like iron and diamonds.
And that&#39;s not even counting the actual griefers!"

Let me just throw in this one gem and I shall leave this topic forever. (Just so you don&#39;t have to ask about how do I know this, this all was told by a friend of mine who still played on the server.)

[b][u]---------------[/u][/b]

The Admin organized another faction war - Blue versus Orange+Green. You might think &quot;it will be a complete and utter steamroll&quot;.

Needless to say, Flawless Victory for Blues - no members lost, all loot gathered, basically a Curb Stomp Battle.

But the real kicker comes now.

After the battle, one of the Blues accidentally complimented Hamster, the Blue Faction leader, in the server&#39;s thread on some forum with a very specific sentence.

The sentence was: [b]&quot;haha gj hamster on those lag machines ;)&quot;[/b] - it was the proof that Blues were using something more than just external scripts - they even lagged the server just to win.

[b]This one sentence led to the Green and Orange Leaders resigning from their places and calling the Admin an unfair pile of shit, the Forum Administrator locking down the thread and the Admin&#39;s account getting deleted AND the server getting closed by himself in rage.[/b]

Let me just throw in this one gem and I shall leave this topic forever. (Just so you don&#39;t have to ask about how do I know this, this all was told by a friend of mine who still played on the server.)

[b][u]---------------[/u][/b]

The Admin organized another faction war - Blue versus Orange+Green. You might think &quot;it will be a complete and utter steamroll&quot;.

And it was. But if you think an alliance of two factions is an unstoppable force, you&#39;re wrong.

The battle was scheduled to start [i]in a day from the announcement.[/i] The Blues were practically ready, and the Alliance had to hurry up. They managed to get diamond tools and enchantments despite the handicap and that Ores-From-Stone-Only plugin. 

When the time finally came for the battle, [b]the Blues had 12 players online, meanwhile the Alliance had 7 players,[/b] 4 from one faction and 3 from the another one. Not that it was already a sure steamroll to start by Blue Faction, something was off about the battle - [b]the server started to lag unusually strong [u]just as the battle started.[/u][/b] People were dropping slots every second, [b]but if one was to keep looking at the server dynmap, they&#39;d spot that only the people who were in Green and Orange faction were crashing[/b]. The Blues were just fine. [b]Despite that, the Admin did not stop the war.[/b] The friend of mine dropped and logged back on only to find himself getting slaughtered by two Blues standing just at the spot where he crashed. 

Needless to say, Flawless Victory for Blues - no members lost, all loot gathered, basically a Curb Stomp Battle.

But the real kicker comes now.

After the battle, one of the Blues accidentally complimented Hamster, the Blue Faction leader, in the server&#39;s thread on some forum with a very specific sentence.

The sentence was: [b]&quot;haha gj hamster on those lag machines ;)&quot;[/b] - it was the proof that Blues were using something more than just external scripts - they even lagged the server just to win.

[b]This one sentence led to the Green and Orange Leaders resigning from their places and calling the Admin an unfair pile of shit, the Forum Administrator locking down the thread and the Admin&#39;s account getting deleted AND the server getting closed by himself in rage.[/b]

TL;DR is in bold.

I probably forgot to mention that Hamster and Admin were close IRL friends. Explains not stopping the war despite the lag.[/QUOTE]

Reminds me of a server I played on ages ago pre Beta 1.8.  It was a server based on some airship plugin.  Admin had set up a couple factions and basically you built aitrships and were supposed to have battles.

Anyways, server went fine for the first week or so, then everything just fell apart.  The Admin&#39;s faction (which was arguably the biggest) was attacked by another one of the more powerful ones, and when there ships got burned down he started making up all these rules and stuff that basically protected his precious ships, such as some kind of weird ratio limit between number of players that had too be online for a battle to happen.

Then the admin started jumping between factions. For a brief time he joined mine (which was probably the smallest and least threatening with only a handful of members), did jack shit except for almost giving away our base location.  After a week of that, he created his own special faction, which got a massive ship for free, stole half our stuff, and then proceeded to bomb our base while none of us were online (breaking his own damn rules).

The next day one of his faction members was afk in spawn and I found their huge ship and hijacked it as well as taking our stuff back.  When he came online he was pissed, but I had already dismantled his ship.  He never found out I did it and the server closed like 2 weeks later.

I later found out that the admin was 12."

Of course I do. I&#39;m not the lucky one when it comes to choosing servers to play on.

There was this time when I became an admin on a server and then was deopped and banned, all because of the issue of swearing on the server and Server Admin&#39;s childish behavior. Yeah. It&#39;s that stupid.

[sp]Just like in my previous stories, none of this is made up. This shit really happened.[/sp]

[b][u]---------------[/u][/b]

Let me tell you the story of yet another server led by kids. 

There is this Polish entertainment site - games, images, videos, jokes section and all that. They&#39;ve launched a Groups section in 2012, which is basically small forums with only one section. Of course, one of the first groups was about Minecraft (blame Polish YouTubers - if not for them, there would be less kids in MC). The group was spammed with server advertisements, but one server in particular caught my attention. It looked nice, seemed like it had a mature crew of admins and a pretty nice map, so I thought to myself &quot;why not join?&quot;. 

And that was one of my biggest mistakes.

As I joined, I found out that the Badmin (geddit? bad admin = badmin okay I&#39;ll stop) was 12. Me not quitting the server by this point was probably yet another big mistake. 

I asked Badmin if I could make a basic display system with redstone. He accepted my request and in a few minutes a simple display was ready to use. That earned me Badmin&#39;s sympathy (yes, the boy had no clue nor interest in redstone, he just asked others to do mechanisms). I was shortly modded, and then admined.

Then it all went downhill.

We (the entire crew of admins) could not do SHIT without Badmin&#39;s permission, not even simple changes to the spawn. Regardless of that, I&#39;ve made several mob arenas, PVP areas and basically many things to entertain the players. The Badmin kinda liked them, so he kept them.

Then, his IRL friend came on. He was the same age. He was admined the very second he joined. He just logged in and got opped. 

5 wild guesses on what happened later. Spoiler: power trip.

I invited him to test a mob arena built by me (well detailed to be honest, I spent hours on it, building, testing). He declined my offer to go with other players, claiming that &quot;he can take these [i]fukers[/i] on by himself&quot;. Needless to say, he got killed by the very first Juggernaut Zombie (diamond armor, and Badmin&#39;s friend had a bow w/ Knockback and Power specifically designed to fight them).

The result?
He removed EVERYTHING I&#39;VE CREATED on the map, banned me and put this reason: &quot;[i]youre arena sucks dick fuk you[/i]&quot;. I&#39;m not making this up, this is the exact sentence.

I was shortly after unbanned and Badmin was begging for me to stay. &quot;Okay, but only if you ban that fucking kid.&quot; His answer: &quot;stop swering this is very rude&quot;. He told me this even though he and his pal were swearing in the first place. I quit and told him to remove anything that was left that I built (he missed some stuff on another map). I was told to &quot;[i]fuk off[/i]&quot; (seriously, why did they use &quot;fuk&quot;?) and that &quot;[i]evrything is his now[/i]&quot;. Cue banned again.

I started a giant hate campaign against him on the Groups on that one site I mentioned in the beginning, I managed to show everyone in the Minecraft group that he is a kid and a liar (multiple screenshots of him admitting to it and lying to others), everyone trusted me. It was like a Pong match, except the ball was several countered arguments, one after one. Meanwhile, Badmin filled a complaint to the Site Administrator that I&#39;m &quot;rude to him&quot;. I was told in the group by the Site Administrator (public post that could be seen by everyone) to turn it down a bit.
Even he couldn&#39;t silence me. He was just told by me (and the entire group which simply band-wagoned after me) that this is a one-on-one thing and no one from outside should interrupt the argument. And apparently for him, banning over 30 people (that posted an opinion on the argument) at once seemed illogical.

To shorten what happened later on, he got flamed on by everyone for being a liar and a hypocrite, the thread was locked down and he is to this day seen among other people hated on the site, crying along with them that &quot;they have been exiled without any reason&quot;.

Also, that is how I got the reputation of the person that can silence even the Site Administrator without consequences.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=scratch (nl);41951572]Do you have more stories like this? I love reading about bad server owners from Gmod and Minecraft.[/QUOTE]
 
Of course I do. I&#39;m not the lucky one when it comes to choosing servers to play on.

There was this time when I became an admin on a server and then was deopped and banned, all because of the issue of swearing on the server and Server Admin&#39;s childish behavior. Yeah. It&#39;s that stupid.

[sp]Just like in my previous stories, none of this is made up. This shit really happened.[/sp]

[b][u]---------------[/u][/b]

Let me tell you the story of yet another server led by kids. 

There is this Polish entertainment site - games, images, videos, jokes section and all that. They&#39;ve launched a Groups section in 2012, which is basically small forums with only one section. Of course, one of the first groups was about Minecraft (blame Polish YouTubers - if not for them, there would be less kids in MC). The group was spammed with server advertisements, but one server in particular caught my attention. It looked nice, seemed like it had a mature crew of admins and a pretty nice map, so I thought to myself &quot;why not join?&quot;. 

And that was one of my biggest mistakes.

As I joined, I found out that the Badmin (geddit? bad admin = badmin okay I&#39;ll stop) was 12. Me not quitting the server by this point was probably yet another big mistake. 

I asked Badmin if I could make a basic display system with redstone. He accepted my request and in a few minutes a simple display was ready to use. That earned me Badmin&#39;s sympathy (yes, the boy had no clue nor interest in redstone, he just asked others to do mechanisms). I was shortly modded, and then admined.

Then it all went downhill.

We (the entire crew of admins) could not do SHIT without Badmin&#39;s permission, not even simple changes to the spawn. Regardless of that, I&#39;ve made several mob arenas, PVP areas and basically many things to entertain the players. The Badmin kinda liked them, so he kept them.

Then, his IRL friend came on. He was the same age. He was admined the very second he joined. He just logged in and got opped. 

5 wild guesses on what happened later. Spoiler: power trip.

I invited him to test a mob arena built by me (well detailed to be honest, I spent hours on it, building, testing). He declined my offer to go with other players, claiming that &quot;he can take these [i]fukers[/i] on by himself&quot;.
