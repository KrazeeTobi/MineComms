                        <postrender input="coming from the &quot;vent out your dislike about minecraft&quot;, I was thinking of reviving my server with a custom modpack intended to make the game harder and introduce new stuff to mess around with. Minecraft is way too easy and not rewarding in my opinion, so I&#39;d personally love to see a server oriented around a more hardcore experience with new stuff to mess with (mystcraft, thaumcraft, you name it). 

how does that sound? does it sound like a good idea?
I haven&#39;t done much planning as I&#39;m not sure if people would be interested or not, but I&#39;m thinking it would be hardcore with unbans once a week in a familiar fashion like Max No Relax does it.

I&#39;m not a big fan of air quality or physics as it sounds more like a hassle, but it looks like it&#39;s possible to disable it. 

then there are a few mods to add on top of that to spice up the experience from vanilla. obviously, I want to stay away from mods which has overpowered components in them. first three mods which comes to mind are [URL=&quot;http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1292130-thaumcraft-4-1-1-14-updated-20-5-2014&quot;]Thaumcraft[/URL], [URL=&quot;http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1280070-mystcraft-0-10-15&quot;]Mystcraft[/URL] and [URL=&quot;http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287648-tinkers-construct&quot;]Tinker&#39;s Construct[/URL]. I&#39;ve had lots of fun with these in the past and they seem to have a nice balance to them.

[editline]According to A&amp;R [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anokute&quot;]Chris Anokute[/URL], &quot;Waking Up in Vegas&quot; played a significant role in initiating Perry&#39;s pivotal move to [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records&quot;]Capitol Records[/URL]. Having been recorded while still under contract with [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records&quot;]Columbia Records[/URL] for an album that was then shelved, Anokute later heard the track on a three-song demo and tried to convince his employers at Capitol to sign Perry, claiming it was a number-one single and its singer a star talent.[SUP][URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_in_Vegas#cite_note-hitquarters-1&quot;][1][/URL][/SUP] In an interview with[URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitQuarters&quot;]HitQuarters[/URL], one of the songwriters of the song, [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Carlsson&quot;]Andreas Carlsson[/URL], claimed that he worked together with Perry and [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Child&quot;]Desmond Child[/URL] to write &quot;Waking Up In Vegas&quot;. Carlsson remarked that they &quot;really wanted to tell the story that described that moment when everybody’s checking out on Vegas after they’ve had their fun. And Katy is the perfect artist to tell such a story - she has humour, and she knows how to deliver it.&quot; Carlsson also said that two of the first aspects of the song to be composed were the main guitar riff - which he already had pre-prepared - and the phrase &quot;put your money where your mouth is,&quot; which they were very keen to use and which for a time was almost used as the song&#39;s title.[SUP][URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_in_Vegas#cite_note-hitquarters-1&quot;][1][/URL][/SUP]In an interview for [I]Pop Eater[/I], Perry revealed the inspiration behind the track, claiming:
&quot;What inspired it [was] this boy I was dating at the time. I was 21. We went to Vegas on a whim and we decided to get fake married. We took all the pictures with the minister, with the fake cake, in the fake chapel and got a fake marriage certificate. We went and bought a wedding dress and a suit at a thrift store, and scanned the pictures and the certificate to my family members, my manager at the time [and] totally freaked the s--- out of them.

&quot;Waking Up in Vegas&quot; was eventually picked as the album&#39;s fourth and final single, with a radio edit version of the song being released on April 7, 2009,[SUP][URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_in_Vegas#cite_note-3&quot;][3][/URL][/SUP] as well as being sent to US radio stations on April 21, 2009.[SUP][URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_in_Vegas#cite_note-4&quot;][4][/URL][/SUP] On the single&#39;s artwork, Perry is seen with two [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice&quot;]dices[/URL]behind her, giving more emphasis to the song&#39;s lyrical content of being in [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas&quot;]Vegas[/URL].[/editline]

I&#39;ve found a decent chunk of mods now. I was hoping to have MITE too, but it&#39;s not forge compatible and modifies the classes directly so that is sadly not an option. tried Terrafirmacraft too, but it&#39;s incompatible with one or more of the mods I&#39;ve found

                            <span v-pre>coming from the &quot;vent out your dislike about minecraft&quot;, I was thinking of reviving my server with a custom modpack intended to make the game harder and introduce new stuff to mess around with. Minecraft is way too easy and not rewarding in my opinion, so I&#39;d personally love to see a server oriented around a more hardcore experience with new stuff to mess with (mystcraft, thaumcraft, you name it). 

how does that sound? does it sound like a good idea?
I haven&#39;t done much planning as I&#39;m not sure if people would be interested or not, but I&#39;m thinking it would be hardcore with unbans once a week in a familiar fashion like Max No Relax does it.

I&#39;m not a big fan of air quality or physics as it sounds more like a hassle, but it looks like it&#39;s possible to disable it. 

then there are a few mods to add on top of that to spice up the experience from vanilla. obviously, I want to stay away from mods which has overpowered components in them. first three mods which comes to mind are [URL=&quot;http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1292130-thaumcraft-4-1-1-14-updated-20-5-2014&quot;]Thaumcraft[/URL], [URL=&quot;http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1280070-mystcraft-0-10-15&quot;]Mystcraft[/URL] and [URL=&quot;http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287648-tinkers-construct&quot;]Tinker&#39;s Construct[/URL]. I&#39;ve had lots of fun with these in the past and they seem to have a nice balance to them.

[editline]According to A&amp;R [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anokute&quot;]Chris Anokute[/URL], &quot;Waking Up in Vegas&quot; played a significant role in initiating Perry&#39;s pivotal move to [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Records&quot;]Capitol Records[/URL]. Having been recorded while still under contract with [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records&quot;]Columbia Records[/URL] for an album that was then shelved, Anokute later heard the track on a three-song demo and tried to convince his employers at Capitol to sign Perry, claiming it was a number-one single and its singer a star talent.[SUP][URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_in_Vegas#cite_note-hitquarters-1&quot;][1][/URL][/SUP] In an interview with[URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HitQuarters&quot;]HitQuarters[/URL], one of the songwriters of the song, [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Carlsson&quot;]Andreas Carlsson[/URL], claimed that he worked together with Perry and [URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Child&quot;]Desmond Child[/URL] to write &quot;Waking Up In Vegas&quot;. Carlsson remarked that they &quot;really wanted to tell the story that described that moment when everybody’s checking out on Vegas after they’ve had their fun. And Katy is the perfect artist to tell such a story - she has humour, and she knows how to deliver it.&quot; Carlsson also said that two of the first aspects of the song to be composed were the main guitar riff - which he already had pre-prepared - and the phrase &quot;put your money where your mouth is,&quot; which they were very keen to use and which for a time was almost used as the song&#39;s title.[SUP][URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_in_Vegas#cite_note-hitquarters-1&quot;][1][/URL][/SUP]In an interview for [I]Pop Eater[/I], Perry revealed the inspiration behind the track, claiming:
&quot;What inspired it [was] this boy I was dating at the time. I was 21. We went to Vegas on a whim and we decided to get fake married. We took all the pictures with the minister, with the fake cake, in the fake chapel and got a fake marriage certificate. We went and bought a wedding dress and a suit at a thrift store, and scanned the pictures and the certificate to my family members, my manager at the time [and] totally freaked the s--- out of them. It was the most hilarious, stupid prank I&#39;ve ever pulled. I still have the wedding dress and the certificate.&quot;[SUP][URL=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Up_in_Vegas#cite_note-popeater-2&quot;][2][/URL][/SUP]

from what I&#39;m seeing, it&#39;s the complete opposite, at least on Facepunch. I think there&#39;s only one modded server currently running, and that is pretty much dead. rest are different flavors of vanilla"

from what I&#39;m seeing, it&#39;s the complete opposite, at least on Facepunch. I think there&#39;s only one modded server currently running, and that is pretty much dead. rest are different flavors of vanilla</span>

it&#39;s one of those either you like it or not situations. I used to not like mods either as most are really complex, but I decided to try them anyway as I find vanilla very stale and repetitive. spawn, do what you always do, get diamonds, and you&#39;re pretty much done. now it&#39;s up to your creativity if you keep playing or not as that&#39;s the only thing you can do at this point. with mods, it usually adds a lot more stuff to fiddle around with and new things to make. it takes much longer to reach the point where there&#39;s nothing but building to do, which I prefer. never been much of a guy with a creative mind, so anything that adds onto the game with the proper balance is a well received addition to me"
