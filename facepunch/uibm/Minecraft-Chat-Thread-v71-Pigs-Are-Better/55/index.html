I can only list a few &#39;big&#39; things, like the end, which is just a novelty to get xp, brewing, which is just for pvp and hardcore, and enchanting, which is pretty useless outside of pvp, as once you get iron+ armor, you&#39;re pretty much unstoppable unless you fall into lava

Yes, but no.

And why do you think it&#39;s not? &quot;Modding API&quot; involves way more than just making the game moddable, it needs to be mostly rewritten first which is exactly what they&#39;ve been doing feature by feature for a while now. 

If they would actually put it as their #1 focus a lot of people would complain that they&#39;re not adding any new content.

Also, what should they do when they do implement it? Are they supposed to do nothing after they add the Modding API because everything can be a mod anyways?"

I didn&#39;t say it&#39;s not already #1, I&#39;m just saying it should always be #1, since in the long run, that&#39;s what is going to keep the game alive and fresh most.

Once they release the modding API, they should squash all bugs with both the modding API and the base game."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Marlamin;41717758]And why do you think it&#39;s not? &quot;Modding API&quot; involves way more than just making the game moddable, it needs to be mostly rewritten first which is exactly what they&#39;ve been doing feature by feature for a while now. 

If they would actually put it as their #1 focus a lot of people would complain that they&#39;re not adding any new content.

Also, what should they do when they do implement it? Are they supposed to do nothing after they add the Modding API because everything can be a mod anyways?[/QUOTE]
 
I didn&#39;t say it&#39;s not already #1, I&#39;m just saying it should always be #1, since in the long run, that&#39;s what is going to keep the game alive and fresh most.

Once they release the modding API, they should squash all bugs with both the modding API and the base game.</span>

The pickaxe head affects what it can mine and it&#39;s mining speed.
The tool binding is nothing more than an extra material.
The tool rod adds a durability modifier.

Manyullun pickaxe head and tool rod, paper binding. Binding does not seem to change anything of a pickaxe. This setup gives you four modifiers. The same effect can be achieved with a Thaumium binding instead of paper, but why do that when paper&#39;s cheaper?"

IIRC the AI changed around this time last year, and yes, they made the mobs smarter. Zombies can now tear down doors after beating on them for a while, and they can infect Villagers. You can change zombified villagers back though. I don&#39;t recall a time when good cart boosters have worked since 1.5 beta. Yes, those are bats. Light shit up as much as you can or they&#39;ll spawn in the dark spots. They&#39;re &quot;ambient&quot; mobs and don&#39;t drop anything. Biomes are still, as you say, fucked. Jeb&#39;s adding some new ones in an upcoming update, I think."
