The dirt platform was covered with a ton of torches, so I could get passive mobs to spawn in there at night."

Did you happen to post it on /v/

I remember that&#39;s how I first learned about minecraft, was on /v/ and saw someone posing a picture which was esentially a 4x4 dirt hole or something like that. I thought hey that looks pretty cool and checked it out. That was years ago though, I&#39;m actually pretty sure infdev, or hell, even a day and night cycle wasn&#39;t a thing yet.

Although I thought it was rather like one of those unity or java games that you sometimes see being posted think oh cool and then never hear from them again."

                            <span v-pre>I remember my first home in my first world, back before jungles or swamps were even a thing; I&#39;d dug out a humble abode into a hill, a cozy underground home that was technically wide-open with open mineshafts and exposed caves. Nowadays I have my big-ol&#39; Redwood Canopy that rises over the jungle, though looking back I kinda feel like building another &quot;hobbit-hole&quot; like before, only with better security.</span>
