I, personally hate and enjoy Minecraft.

I, personally hate and enjoy Minecraft. I hate it for its shitty code, its shitty community, its direction changing every few days, but I love it for all the good times I&#39;ve had and all the friends I&#39;ve made and the people who put in hard work to make a server or a map or a big build for others to enjoy.[/QUOTE]
 
It was, and still is a brilliant game. But it could have been so much more.</span>

I&#39;m currently in the middle of converting a big Savanna into a desert. Changing the terrain is simple enough with MCEdit, however I&#39;ve still got a problem involving the trees that the Savanna leaves behind. As you can see I began setting trees on fire and just letting them burn away but...it&#39;s a slow process. I also attempted using the flood fill tool in MCEdit to just change the trees into air, but this method is also slow and requires mindless clicking.

Anyone know of any extremely quick ways to deforest an area?"

It was actually one of the moves towards a modding API, since it means mod developers won&#39;t have to develop two seperate mods that do the same thing or create hundreds of special exception cases for singleplayer.

And then of course there were also mods that simply did not exist for multiplayer because it wasn&#39;t [I]really[/I] worth the hassle before - compare the Technic pack modlist to the Tekkit modlist. Quite a difference."

No, separation of server and client is far from dumb (it&#39;s how most games work). Having to maintain two separate sets of code is dumb. To be honest, the way helifreak phrased their post was dumb. Mojang didn&#39;t &quot;decide they could not be bothered&quot; updating two branches of the same game, they realised that all the code for physics, block interaction, mob ai, etc (aka stuff that should be running serverside) shouldn&#39;t be  mixed together with the code for rendering, guis, input handling, etc (aka stuff that should be running clientside). 
It&#39;s called &#39;good programming practice&#39;, not &#39;fucking dumb&#39;.
Yeah sure, it might have introduced bugs from multiplayer into singleplayer, but that&#39;s an inevitability when you&#39;re dealing with a shitty multiplayer implementation like the one Notch left for the new devs to deal with."

How about custom worldgen so the top of the map (Y=256) is bedrock, then everything below is stone, huge caverns etc. With that much space you could have a &#39;hell&#39; like area below everything for the inevitable dug-too-deep scenario."

It&#39;s basically meant to be Vanilla+. The point is to expand on current Minecraft gameplay rather than change the flow drastically.
The pack is going to be based around PVP heavily. Magic isn&#39;t going to be a big part of the pack because any mod that adds magic overshadows any vanilla mechanics.
Here&#39;s a list of mods that are currently in the pack. I&#39;m still messing around with some others so nothing is final.

Biomes O&#39; Plenty

                            <span v-pre>I&#39;m working on a server modpack. I&#39;m trying to keep it as balanced as possible so it won&#39;t have any tech mods or auto-mining machines into it. It&#39;s basically meant to be Vanilla+. The point is to expand on current Minecraft gameplay rather than change the flow drastically.
The pack is going to be based around PVP heavily. Magic isn&#39;t going to be a big part of the pack because any mod that adds magic overshadows any vanilla mechanics.
Here&#39;s a list of mods that are currently in the pack. I&#39;m still messing around with some others so nothing is final.
[CODE]Bibliocraft
Biomes O&#39; Plenty
Chisel
EnchantingPlus
FlatBedrock
ForgeMultipart
JABBA
OpenBlocks(might disable elevators)
Tinker&#39;s Construct
