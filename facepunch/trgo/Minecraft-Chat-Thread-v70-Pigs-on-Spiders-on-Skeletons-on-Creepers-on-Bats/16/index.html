if everything in direwolf20 is in ultimate, then your world will be fine. all official ftb packs (as in, not private packs) share the same block id&#39;s throughout all. so unless you have a mod in DW20 like compact solars, and in ultimate you have advanced solars, the compact/advanced solars have the same id&#39;s, so it&#39;ll just be converted to the right level. there may be some issues with gregtech and IC2, so you might want to delete gregtech (it wont break your world, but might delete/make a few blocks unusable)

but say you have biblocraft in DW20 but not in ultimate. everything in biblocraft will disappear (although biblocraft IS in ultimate so, just an example)"

IC2&#39;s medium-difficult until you accidentally hook your machines up to the wrong voltage. Then it&#39;s rage-inducing. BuildCraft and its derivative mods (Forestry, Thermal Expansion, RailCraft) are easier to learn since there is no immediate (sans Thermal Expansion&#39;s redstone energy cell) and cheap method of power storage; it&#39;s all to be used right then and there. If you&#39;re going to dabble into GregTech, you&#39;re best to start your world off using Thermal Expansion machines. They&#39;re run on BuildCraft power and have the same, if not better, effects than IC2 machines.

The pulverizer has a percentage to return a dust of another ore, the sawmill can make two extra stacks of planks from a stack of logs. The aqueous accumulator (best in some water) can keep your combustion engines cooled and your RailCraft boilers quenched. The magma crucible can melt cobblestone and netherrack into lava (and ender pearls into liquid ender and redstone into liquid redstone). The liquid transposer can fill and extract your cans/capsules/tesseract frames/energy cell frames. There are [url=http://ftbwiki.org/Thermal_Expansion]more machines[/url] to Thermal Expansion, and all on BuildCraft power.

My best bet with a workhouse is a RailCraft boiler with steam engines (not TE&#39;s steam engine). I personally have a RedPower windmill power a sugar cane farm (with part of the reaping head harvest/plant wheat), sort it out to their respective factories (wheat goes with dirt to make compost, sugar cane goes straight to a fermenter).
Instead of sugar cane, you can do all wheat and autocraft most of it into plantballs (IC2) and a small portion into compost. Plantballs do four times the amount of biomass than wheat, but only double the amount of a sugar cane. With sugar cane, one square meter of sugar cane (grown completely) can supply the biomass of one plantball (two canes, 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 = one plantball). If you&#39;re one of those weirdos who still lives in the past with a cactus farm, a cactus block makes a good alternative to a sugar cane.

The biomass is then refined (BuildCraft refinery preferred, jumpstart with external power for now) into biofuel, a weaker alternative to fuel at 5MJ/t (combustion engine compared to fuel&#39;s 6MJ/t). Keeping an aqueous accumulator (two water sources touching its sides) piped to a boiler, the biofuel can then be pumped into a boiler to make steam of the water. From that point, you&#39;re up to your own for the steam. I pipe it to some engines (commercial steam or industrial steam recommended) and hook those to a [URL=&quot;http://ftbwiki.org/Redstone_Energy_Conduit&quot;]redstone energy conduit[/URL] (TE, they never blow up from power buildup from lack of power use). Leaving the engines on and on the conduit will result in hopefully never-ending power source that will never blow up from too much power. If you have to use conductive pipes instead of a conduit, plop a [url=http://ftbwiki.org/Thermionic_Fabricator]thermionic fabricator[/url] somewhere at the end of the line to absorb the rest of the MJ so the pipes don&#39;t blow up. Holy crap, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d actually manage this word wall.

Anyway, if you&#39;re still in need of EU, same thing except instead of hooking the steam from the boiler to engines, use it in a [url=http://ftbwiki.org/Steam_Turbine]steam turbine[/url] to generate EU from it. The steam turbine that goes into the housing will take several days (real-time) of constant use before breaking and requiring replacement. RedPower windmills seem to be just as durable, as I have yet to have one break on me. Mind that the steam turbine will generate 100EU/t (MV). Gold cables can handle that kind of voltage but have very terrible energy losses."

                            <span v-pre>Me and a friend are trying to play with FTB. 

Both have windows 8 computers with most likely identical hardware. 

We both downloaded the FTB launcher, Both got to download the files but when we launch. I can launch and he crashes with the following error.

Even when I give him my entire installation he still crashes with the same fckin error. 

If anyone knows how to fix this I&#39;d appreciate it. This fucking shit has been annoying me for too long</span>
