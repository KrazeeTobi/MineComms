Are you making your books the correct way, and not just what you think might be the correct way?

I thought I figured out how to make ages with the new system but they were always awful, until I looked up a step-by-step tutorial that explained it; it fixed my problem.

Edit: If you create a notebook and organize the pages inside just how you want them (in the order you&#39;d put them into the book) I think you can use that to automatically create a descriptive book while in the writing desk UI. 
This video should help you:

Edit edit: Another note, the &quot;new Mystcraft system&quot; is how the mod author has intended it to be all along, which is apparently more like the canonical Myst system. The author is pretty adamant about how the mod is [i]supposed[/i] to be hard."

Are you making your books the correct way, and not just what you think might be the correct way?

I thought I figured out how to make ages with the new system but they were always awful, until I looked up a step-by-step tutorial that explained it; it fixed my problem.

Edit: If you create a notebook and organize the pages inside just how you want them (in the order you&#39;d put them into the book) I think you can use that to automatically create a descriptive book while in the writing desk UI.

The idea is that the entire world is a floating machine on wich you survive.
I need a good idea of what gold could be. I&#39;m thinking lighweight machinery, or some kind of material used in advanced technology. But i dont know what. Neither do i have a good idea for lapis or emerald.
Could anyone help me out?

Also, rust or no rust?[/QUOTE]
A liquid flow of some sort for the lapis. Like a cooling blue-tinted liquid.
A floppy disk for the emerald, the block being a screen with data and a floppy disk player.
No idea for the gold, maybe some pistons or I don&#39;t know.
Rust for the mossy alternative.

And to help for the recognition, make each ore have a specific color. Make the batteries more black, the redstone red, the diamond blue-tinted and the iron more orange."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Miricx;39866654]Ahh.. I feel like Minecraft is getting extremely boring, actually. :/
I will always remember the good ol&#39; times in alpha.

Today there is no more excitement, imo. You know how to survive, you know how to build nice things and you know all the crafting recipies.

There&#39;s nothing more to look forward to, such as before when you had thoughts like:

-Ooo, wonder how minecraft will look like in Beta!
-Cant wait for the full release!
-I wonder how the next update will look like.
-So this is Alpha? I wonder how Minecraft will look like in 2 years

Minecraft is fully released now.

I&#39;m speaking of course to the people who saw the Minecraft 2-3 years back. I&#39;m not trying to offend the game, this game is still extremely great and is still my favorite game.
Cause I still play Minecraft for some reason, It&#39;s like I&#39;m attached to it. :P

Also, here&#39;s something me and my friend built about 2 months ago. Took us 4 hours to build :D
