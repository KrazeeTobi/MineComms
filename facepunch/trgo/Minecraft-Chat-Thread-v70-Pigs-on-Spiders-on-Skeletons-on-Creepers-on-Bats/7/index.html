I got denied when the video was around 400k views. I lost out on like 4-6 thousand dollars.

I have 100% permission from notch and from mindthings to make money on the video and youtube said I didn&#39;t... have permission. 

The most I can do is keep monetizing the copy of the video on my new main channel, which is around 80k hits and share that one."

First of all, you only waited like ten minutes before coming here; second, &quot;way to lazy to Repost&quot; isn&#39;t a fucking excuse; third, you provided absolutely nothing useful for others to figure out what the root(s) of your problems might be, you just enumerated your issues."

First of all, you only waited like ten minutes before coming here; second, &quot;way to lazy to Repost&quot; isn&#39;t a fucking excuse; third, you provided absolutely nothing useful for others to figure out what the root(s) of your problems might be, you just enumerated your issues.</span>

It&#39;s a desert, and I need it to be *not* a desert. Preferably a forest or swamp, but the specific biome isn&#39;t the issue.

The world is also [i]extremely[/i] mod-heavy (I&#39;m using Twilight Forest trees, for example) so I can&#39;t use MCedit, because not only has it refused to change the biome for me (it always throws an error at me) but if I modify the world, it&#39;ll screw up all the mod blocks. I&#39;ve been using WorldEdit for a lot of terraforming, but the setbiome function is broken (apparently there&#39;s a lot of broken parts in the SinglePlayerCommands version, which I&#39;m using).

Does anyone have suggestions for what I could use or how I could change the biome, with a method that keeps the world as intact as possible? I&#39;m using all Forge mods, which I guess makes things slightly easier.[/QUOTE]

You would have to compare Tekkit&#39;s and FtB&#39;s mods, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fairly alright as far as blocks go, but I&#39;m not so sure about things like MoreHealthRPG and the like, if Tekkit still has that kind of stuff.
Just make sure to back up before trying anything, safe as it may appear."

You would have to compare Tekkit&#39;s and FtB&#39;s mods, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fairly alright as far as blocks go, but I&#39;m not so sure about things like MoreHealthRPG and the like, if Tekkit still has that kind of stuff.
Just make sure to back up before trying anything, safe as it may appear.</span>

You&#39;d have to make sure all the block IDs matched from Tekkit to FTB. If they don&#39;t, then it&#39;s going to be a painful amount of manual work to edit the configuration files, as Manibogi said, comparing the two to see which IDs need to be reallocated."

The Technic team have released the [URL=&quot;http://www.technicpack.net/&quot;]Technic Platform[/URL]. It allows users to create modpacks which can then be downloaded and updated through the new Technic Launcher.  I highly recommend the [URL=&quot;http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/details/plussigmapack.27&quot;]PlusSigma pack[/URL], which is crammed full of adventuring mods. You&#39;ll probably horribly die as often as in Dark Souls.

There are a hell of a lot of packs already. [URL=&quot;http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/list/top&quot;]Take a look![/URL]


As for Tekkit Classic and Lite, AFAIK Classic uses Bukkit and runs on an older version of Minecraft, while Lite is the newer Forge based version."

The Technic team have released the [URL=&quot;http://www.technicpack.net/&quot;]Technic Platform[/URL]. It allows users to create modpacks which can then be downloaded and updated through the new Technic Launcher.

There are a hell of a lot of packs already. [URL=&quot;http://www.technicpack.net/modpack/list/top&quot;]Take a look![/URL]


As for Tekkit Classic and Lite, AFAIK Classic uses Bukkit and runs on an older version of Minecraft, while Lite is the newer Forge based version.</span>
