Test #1, Client: Computronic Laboratories. Sir Cyclade.

Over the top just to handle a single-axis quarry? Sure. Shipment of the IO expander finally came in. Another success of the Forestry Postal System. A letter came in with the suggestion of more words to modularize the announced reaping head control system. To answer some questions...
1) The system planned makes use of the recently-shipped IO expander, along with a manual of FORTH words for it, including IOXSET (set) and IOXRST (reset). Ribbon cable goes in, bundled cable goes out. Split from the bundled cables are WHITE and ORANGE wires, which lead to the individual motors.

2) The block breakers (reaping head) are external to the system. The system is intended to be activated on a press of a button. Wireless recievers will be necessary for the head. Signal goes from reciever to NOT gate to timer, which activates redstone tube frames.

3) The system is also planned to have a variable amount of distance for the motors to move the reaping head. It also presumes one is using a long arm for the head (not using block-breakers and deployers to remove and replace frames). If I can find it possible to write words with parameters and my newb-level FORTH knowledge to be correct, then [b]21 FARM[/b] will be my expected parameter for a 21m farm. Plus it would help with sales on servers if someone appreciates the RPC 8/e as much as I do.

(Don&#39;t shoot me, it&#39;s sort of fun doing this roleplay stuff sometimes.)

I swear, this thing is an abomination from the Nether!

This is probably more than most people are willing to do on any server. Gather wood? Okay. Deal with Greg&#39;s atrocious nerfs? Check. Deal with FORTH? Good luck convincing anyone to do that.

This is probably more than most people are willing to do on any server. Gather wood? Okay. Deal with Greg&#39;s atrocious nerfs? Check. Deal with FORTH? Good luck convincing anyone to do that.

Honestly, minecraft is horribly optimized. Every update adds more and with the same janky optimization we get even less performance.

I have a computer with an above average graphics card and above average processor with 9 gigs of ram and since the last update, minecraft started dropping FPS on me. I went from 200+ fps stable to 60-10 since the last few updates.

I&#39;m trying to get a minecraft server but I don&#39;t want to over spend.

Also please say what host you are using.

Thanks.

Honestly, minecraft is horribly optimized. Every update adds more and with the same janky optimization we get even less performance.

I have a computer with an above average graphics card and above average processor with 9 gigs of ram and since the last update, minecraft started dropping FPS on me. I went from 200+ fps stable to 60-10 since the last few updates. It&#39;s embarrassing when the top (albeit stock) computer of the last two years can&#39;t even run minecraft with mods and optimizers.[/QUOTE]

Golems in Thaumcraft are pretty neat for farming. You can set up automatic farms without massive arrays of piping and machinery, just a smart straw golem and a wood golem can do the job easily.
That, or Forestry which is basically making a ton of machinery to farming if that&#39;s your thing. Adds new types of farming too, bees and tree breeding, and a whole bunch of new items you can get as a result of it."
