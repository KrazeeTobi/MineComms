That depends.. I don&#39;t want a &quot;Goose superfaction&quot; that ruins the experience for everybody else.

I&#39;m well aware that they banded up and have created superfactions on several servers just to destroy them (albeit these servers were shitty).

I like Zert and Rageblood, but some things will have to change before I allow the geese in. 

If this was a regular factions server, I&#39;d be content with them playing however large of a faction that they want, but since everybody is visible from Dynmap and all faction locations are known, some extra precautions need to be taken to prevent faction domination. 

In regular factions you can just hide far away and be safe long enough for you to build defenses or gain armor.

McMMO will not be in this revision.

I wish I could have a client-side map that would show faction locations only after you&#39;ve visited them, like Dynmap but for specific people.

I could always have Dynmap show nothing but the continents, but then the map would almost be pointless.

Any solutions?"

All I&#39;m doing now is going into my Mystcraft age with nether fortresses full of overworld mobs, and mass-slaughtering them in my quantum armor.

Also, are there any weapons that are considerably better than a nano saber? I tried making the hunter&#39;s handgun, and while it&#39;s decently powerful, making ammo for it is a pain in the ass, especially if you want to go stronger than neutral shots."

                            <span v-pre>What&#39;s the easiest way to farm experience in FTB? I&#39;ve read about making turtles to kill mobs, and using a brain in a jar to harvest the exp, but building and programming turtles sounds really difficult just to accomplish that.

All I&#39;m doing now is going into my Mystcraft age with nether fortresses full of overworld mobs, and mass-slaughtering them in my quantum armor.

Also, are there any weapons that are considerably better than a nano saber? I tried making the hunter&#39;s handgun, and while it&#39;s decently powerful, making ammo for it is a pain in the ass, especially if you want to go stronger than neutral shots.</span>

A sword of the zephyr from Thaumcraft can hit multiple enemies at once. I believe it does the same damage as an iron sword, but you can sit at a spawner for a bit and wait for a few to spawn, then slaughter them all very quickly and wait for more to spawn."

I&#39;m well aware that they banded up and have created superfactions on several servers just to destroy them (albeit these servers were shitty).

I like Zert and Rageblood, but some things will have to change before I allow the geese in. 

If this was a regular factions server, I&#39;d be content with them playing however large of a faction that they want, but since everybody is visible from Dynmap and all faction locations are known, some extra precautions need to be taken to prevent faction domination. 

In regular factions you can just hide far away and be safe long enough for you to build defenses or gain armor.

McMMO will not be in this revision.

I wish I could have a client-side map that would show faction locations only after you&#39;ve visited them, like Dynmap but for specific people.

I could always have Dynmap show nothing but the continents, but then the map would almost be pointless.

Any solutions?[/QUOTE]
 Dynmaps can ruin the fun, because the whole idea of spies and espionage is completely ruined when people can just open a link and see the entire world.

Depends on the situation. Most of the time, you&#39;re right, but letting 80 or so stack up in a small room with a spawner means you can kill them all in 3 or 4 swings. (You may want to turn your volume down though)
If you&#39;re happy charging around with a one-shotting sword, there&#39;s nothing that can increase your XP gain. You may want to look into a turtle farm, direwolf has a pretty good setup guide on one of his videos."

Use melee turtles, they&#39;re really easy to program
just type in the turtle.

After the server I play in was reset because the host&#39;s internet derped, I logged back in just to find my house became a chunk error. Luckly the chunk happened to end right at my inner walls (where my chests were located), and the border of my Pumpkin Pie [sp]a.k.a best food[/sp] farm, so my two most important things were saved. So he regenerated the chunk, but as a desert hill. I couldn&#39;t get a picture of it before he started to blow the massive hill up, but this is the best I got:

                            <span v-pre>So here&#39;s a fun story:
After the server I play in was reset because the host&#39;s internet derped, I logged back in just to find my house became a chunk error. Luckly the chunk happened to end right at my inner walls (where my chests were located), and the border of my Pumpkin Pie [sp]a.k.a best food[/sp] farm, so my two most important things were saved. So he regenerated the chunk, but as a desert hill. I couldn&#39;t get a picture of it before he started to blow the massive hill up, but this is the best I got:

After blowing up one of my empty chests, the rest was cleaned by hand:

And, a couple birch trees later, I restored my house to it&#39;s former glory:

Eventually, a faction&#39;s base [i]will[/i] be discovered, regardless of precautions taken. If the faction is being a prick or their enemy has spies, then it doesn&#39;t take nearly as long.[/QUOTE]
 

Yeah but without the dynmap the world may as well be a closed off minecraft gen&#39;d world.

[QUOTE=TMBGFan;39947944]Perhaps make it so that factions don&#39;t show on dynmap? Bases and stuff would still be there, so if someone says &quot;My base is in India&quot; you&#39;ll be able to scan the subcontinent for signs of habitation.

Also, you&#39;re able to hide from the dynmap, so if someone wants their whereabouts unseen they can just hide.[/QUOTE]
 
But when traveling across continents or something, getting exact bearings is near impossible when you&#39;re hidden.</span>

Decided I want to play with Buildcraft and IndustrialCraft2, So I installed MC 1.4.5 (Latest compatible IC2 version) and installed the correct Forge version.

I then put in industrialcraft2 and everything launched fine, Altough when I add Buildcraft to the mix the game won&#39;t start and crash with an error &quot;Failed to launch game&quot; or something.

Anyone know the problem?"

                            <span v-pre>So I&#39;ve wanted to try MC again after a while. 

Decided I want to play with Buildcraft and IndustrialCraft2, So I installed MC 1.4.5 (Latest compatible IC2 version) and installed the correct Forge version.

I then put in industrialcraft2 and everything launched fine, Altough when I add Buildcraft to the mix the game won&#39;t start and crash with an error &quot;Failed to launch game&quot; or something.

Anyone know the problem?</span>

By keep your world intact, do you mean the terrain, or the buildings?
If you mean the terrain, just grab the seed and pop it in when you create your Ultimate world, if you mean buildings, then I have no clue, besides MCEditing them into your new world :v:"
