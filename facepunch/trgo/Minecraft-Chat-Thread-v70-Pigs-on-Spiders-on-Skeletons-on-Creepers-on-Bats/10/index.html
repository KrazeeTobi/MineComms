The idea is that the entire world is a floating machine on wich you survive.
I need a good idea of what gold could be. I&#39;m thinking lighweight machinery, or some kind of material used in advanced technology. But i dont know what. Neither do i have a good idea for lapis or emerald.
Could anyone help me out?

Also, rust or no rust?[/QUOTE]

I need some opinions.

The idea is that the entire world is a floating machine on wich you survive.
I need a good idea of what gold could be. I&#39;m thinking lighweight machinery, or some kind of material used in advanced technology. But i dont know what. Neither do i have a good idea for lapis or emerald.
Could anyone help me out?

Also, rust or no rust?[/QUOTE]
 
Heck yes, we need more dithered retro packs, less ugly realistic stuff.
Also rust for mossy variants.</span>

 Aluminium is not rare or valuable though. I doubt terribly many people know that aluminium used to be extremely expensive before electrolysis was used to isolate it. 

Maybe you could make it Platinum, which is extremely expensive and rare. In fact, in the modern day, platinum is often ranked above gold . Platinum credit cards, platinum albums, etcetera. And Platinum is used in some tech applications as well. It&#39;s used in some anti-cancer drugs, which could be golden apples perhaps. It&#39;s also used in catalytic converters in cars, for spark plugs, and for electrodes. It&#39;s primary use though, other than catalytic converters, is jewelry, which would also fit with gold in Minecraft, since a lot of texture packs make the gold armour and tools extremely ornamental."

I was thinking about this the other day. The Painterly pack has options to make Netherrack and Nether Brick look meaty, (along with the unrelated &quot;BEE HELL&quot; options) but nothing quite on the scale you&#39;re thinking."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=pansarkurt;39874941]I just came up with another cool idea for a texture pack.

Imagine the world is a human, and the ground is the body.
Bedrock is bone, stone is flesh, dirt is skin.
Redstone would be neurons and coal could be glucose. The nether would be the digestion system, with lava re-textured into acid.

It would be called... Parasitecraft...[/QUOTE]
 
I was thinking about this the other day. The Painterly pack has options to make Netherrack and Nether Brick look meaty, (along with the unrelated &quot;BEE HELL&quot; options) but nothing quite on the scale you&#39;re thinking.</span>

Ok, so I have another mystcraft question, if anyone can help: I recently found the &quot;dense ores&quot; page, but it seems like no matter what combination of pages I set up, the world has spontaneous explosions or decay or blindness or something equally horrible.

Dense Ores adds a ton of instability, so you need to add stability by using symbols like Scorched or Charged. Scorched only works once, but charged will end up lagging from lightning entities before you get a world that doesn&#39;t destroy itself."

Forestry has the [url=http://ftbwiki.org/Treetap_%28Forestry%29]treetap[/url], an older farm, but that&#39;s about to be replaced with [url=http://forestry.sengir.net/wiki.new/doku.php?id=farms:programming]MultiFarms[/url]. Use a rubberised electron tube (electron tube using rubber instead of metals in a Forestry thermionic fabricator) on a circuit board (soldering iron required, set to manual farm).

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Loofiloo;39877013]Now a different question: How do I get an automated rubber farm working? All the wikis and tutorials all over the internet are really sparse in their information in this regard. I need a really in-depth guide, but preferably not a video, if it can be helped.

In fact, pretty much everything related to Forestry is really hard to learn about. It&#39;s like someone just made this huge complex mod but really doesn&#39;t want to tell anyone how to use it. And maybe other people are just so uninterested in it that the wikis don&#39;t get filled in very much.[/QUOTE]

Yeah, I never understood how that automatic treetap works. Do I need to attach it to a tree? Do I just put it near a tree? Does it have an area of effect? Does it pick up sticky resin on its own? What does it do with sticky resin? Does it have to work in conjunction with other machines?

I would have made one of those things a long time ago but I don&#39;t know the first thing about how it works, and the wiki tells me nothing."
