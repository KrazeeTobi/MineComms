Getting respect takes time, and sadly you&#39;re not helping your cause out when you still keep ranting about sewers (and claiming ideas as your own still).

Here&#39;s a tip for you for future posting :

When you&#39;re about to click &quot;submit reply&quot;, ask yourself the following question.

&quot;Is this something that resembles my old posting style?&quot;

If the answer is yes, rewrite your post completely and ask yourself that question again.

Only when you can say no to your question should you post.
That&#39;s the way you&#39;ll gain some respect, because right now your respect account is in the red."

It&#39;s more like a game of chess where you keep moving your pieces into the line of fire.
