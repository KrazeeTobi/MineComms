2b2t is the longest running and largest minecraft world ever made. [B]There are no rules, no staff, and infinite possibility[/B], in a completely vanilla setting. The world (at the time of writing this) is [B]787GB large and 49 months old[/B] (19 Jan 2015) and nearly 60,000 players have wandered the world at least once. The server will continue to grow and age as long as the community pays $90 monthy to maintain it. If you&#39;re someone who loves to explore, discover and create this is the server for you, there are a multitude of bases, forms of terrain to explore, and (thanks to a few dozen exploits, and even one back-door over the years) plenty of OP gear, loot, and resources to steal, provided you&#39;re lucky and persistent enough to go out there and find it. At peak times the server has around thirty players on, some are friendly, most are deadly. 

Facepunch was also part of its history, as proven on this threads: [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1083343&quot;]Here[/URL], [URL=&quot;http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1105156&quot;]Here[/URL] [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1160481&quot;]Here[/URL], [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1174308&quot;]Here[/URL], [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1250221&quot;]Here[/URL] [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1418046&quot;]Here[/URL] and [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1447148&quot;]Here[/URL].

In 27th April of 2011, Chezhead attempted to make a [B]Facepunch Republic[/B] in the server, however he startled most of the 4chan playerbase in the process. Because of this, the Republic never happened, being sabotaged over and over again by infiltrated players and griefers. But things have changed... 2b2t is currently in a era of peace. Griefers and griefings have decreased in number through the years. Because of this, bases like Valkyria, Gape, Asgard, Nova and Fenrir were able to happen. Playing in 2b2t is not just playing minecraft. This server is the ultimate minecraft online experience. No rules. No Admins. Welcome to Minecraft Hell.

The server was also inspiration for the Player Judge Holden to make a Comic about it:

There is also[URL=&quot;http://the2b2t.blogspot.com.br/&quot;]The 2b2t Blog[/URL], done by James_Rustles, who collects stories of the server and even some of his own.

Getting out of spawn is always a hard task, no matter when you log in. The server is filled with ruins of the past. Destroyed bases, homes and towns. Don&#39;t expect to survive in the first try.

The IP is [B]2b2t.org[/B]. Good luck, try not to die too much.

Here is what other facepunchers said about 2b2t on the older threads:

[QUOTE=Chezhead]2b2t is a server I find very interesting. It&#39;s basically an open, public server with no rules whatsoever. No admins, no plugins, no anything. This makes it a pvp free for all.
Many communities are invited to this cesspool of a server, including Something Awful, 4chan, and our own Facepunch.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Within]Terminologically correct it is an anarchy server. 2b2t is the only server out there true to Minecraft&#39;s gamemode: survival. It&#39;s the only server not infested by idiot-cunt-kid admins fucking up the server with every Bukkit plugin out there. The server is completely vanilla with the exception of the Bukkit plugin NoCheat. There are no admins, no moderators, no OPs, no bans, no kicks, no punishment, no rules, no nothing. It&#39;s up to you to survive. And that&#39;s why we like it.
People from all over the Internet has adventured (and is still adventuring): from Facepunch, /b/, /v/, Reddit, SA and even DeviantART.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=IliekBoxes]We&#39;re all equally worthless on this server. Nobody cares if you are raped, your base is destroyed, your friends betray you and your shit is stolen.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Phagocitic]2b2t provides a very unique experience to players both new and old to Minecraft. On average, there are usually about 40 or so players on at once, so you can easily make new friends (or enemies). There are ruins of old bases fucking everywhere, so if you are the kind of person who loves to explore, 2b2t is for you. Because there are no rules, if you&#39;re the type of person to spam chat with racism or grief any base in sight, you can do it to your heart&#39;s desire. And if you are just generally bored, hop on 2b2t, there&#39;s always an interesting conversation going on.[/QUOTE]

Here is a compilation of screenshots and images from older 2b2t threads(Some images comes with explanation):

There is also[URL=&quot;http://the2b2t.blogspot.com.br/&quot;]The 2b2t Blog[/URL], done by James_Rustles, who collects stories of the server and even some of his own.

Getting out of spawn is always a hard task, no matter when you log in. The server is filled with ruins of the past. Destroyed bases, homes and towns. Don&#39;t expect to survive in the first try.

The IP is [B]2b2t.org[/B]. Good luck, try not to die too much.

Here is what other facepunchers said about 2b2t on the older threads:

[QUOTE=Chezhead]2b2t is a server I find very interesting. It&#39;s basically an open, public server with no rules whatsoever. No admins, no plugins, no anything. This makes it a pvp free for all.
Many communities are invited to this cesspool of a server, including Something Awful, 4chan, and our own Facepunch.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Within]Terminologically correct it is an anarchy server. 2b2t is the only server out there true to Minecraft&#39;s gamemode: survival. It&#39;s the only server not infested by idiot-cunt-kid admins fucking up the server with every Bukkit plugin out there. The server is completely vanilla with the exception of the Bukkit plugin NoCheat. There are no admins, no moderators, no OPs, no bans, no kicks, no punishment, no rules, no nothing. It&#39;s up to you to survive. And that&#39;s why we like it.
People from all over the Internet has adventured (and is still adventuring): from Facepunch, /b/, /v/, Reddit, SA and even DeviantART.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=IliekBoxes]We&#39;re all equally worthless on this server. Nobody cares if you are raped, your base is destroyed, your friends betray you and your shit is stolen.[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Phagocitic]2b2t provides a very unique experience to players both new and old to Minecraft. On average, there are usually about 40 or so players on at once, so you can easily make new friends (or enemies). There are ruins of old bases fucking everywhere, so if you are the kind of person who loves to explore, 2b2t is for you. Because there are no rules, if you&#39;re the type of person to spam chat with racism or grief any base in sight, you can do it to your heart&#39;s desire. And if you are just generally bored, hop on 2b2t, there&#39;s always an interesting conversation going on.[/QUOTE]

Here is a compilation of screenshots and images from older 2b2t threads(Some images comes with explanation):

260 Images of history and autism. A history that is still being written. Its up to you to decide if you want to be part of the Minecraft most complex server.
