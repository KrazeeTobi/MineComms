Not really, I have a simple submission on Venn&#39;s server, thankfully the server is down so no griefing. :D

It&#39;s a Fully rendered Trench, even with bunkers,AA Guns, and a mortar pit.

Their servers are terrible, sectioned off into about 5 or so different groups, stopping new players from being able to build. they have a huge map, but they limit new players to a 64x128 section of it, tucked away in the corner, then the next section is for their &quot;members&quot;.

First, they feel that they have the right to judge peoples servers and add them to a &quot;Bad servers&quot; list. One of the servers a friend of mine hosts is the only one on there (muppets never even had the right IP or have the right Name anymore) The only reason iti s on there is because one of the members is butthurt about something. They also seem to have this unwarranted self importance, where everything they say, is now law in the Minecraft community...

Their servers are terrible, sectioned off into about 5 or so different groups, stopping new players from being able to build. they have a huge map, but they limit new players to a 64x128 section of it, tucked away in the corner, then the next section is for their &quot;members&quot;. This is fairly large, but stops guests from building in there, you cannot build on or past a wall they have built if you are not in the usergroup for the land over it. The last group area I saw was their builders area, which takes up a large portion of the map. If you are not going to treat your players equall, then what kind of a community are you?

Though there are some excellent trolls who pose as them to say they are &quot;judging&quot; your server as a inspection, when it is really a reason for them to grief.[/QUOTE]

Thing is I&#39;m not a griever. Your OPs muted me earlier for complaining about the fact the guest area is so full, you can&#39;t build, is this fair? No, is this how you attract new players? No, That is how you be a elitist asshat who thinks you are more important. Now GTFO my internets, and stick to your shit."

Thing is I&#39;m not a griever. Your OPs muted me earlier for complaining about the fact the guest area is so full, you can&#39;t build, is this fair? No, is this how you attract new players? No, That is how you be a elitist asshat who thinks you are more important. Now GTFO my internets, and stick to your shit.</span>

Laugh at what? I&#39;m not so sure what you&#39;re laughing at, he&#39;s bringing up very good contradictions to that server, and you do nothing but laugh at it? That&#39;s not a very good way to raise a community."

First, they feel that they have the right to judge peoples servers and add them to a &quot;Bad servers&quot; list. One of the servers a friend of mine hosts is the only one on there (muppets never even had the right IP or have the right Name anymore) The only reason iti s on there is because one of the members is butthurt about something. They also seem to have this unwarranted self importance, where everything they say, is now law in the Minecraft community...

Their servers are terrible, sectioned off into about 5 or so different groups, stopping new players from being able to build. they have a huge map, but they limit new players to a 64x128 section of it, tucked away in the corner, then the next section is for their &quot;members&quot;. This is fairly large, but stops guests from building in there, you cannot build on or past a wall they have built if you are not in the usergroup for the land over it. The last group area I saw was their builders area, which takes up a large portion of the map. If you are not going to treat your players equall, then what kind of a community are you?

Though there are some excellent trolls who pose as them to say they are &quot;judging&quot; your server as a inspection, when it is really a reason for them to grief.[/QUOTE]

Sorry to hear about your bad experience on WoM hex...

The bad server was posted due to a number of complaints sent to WoM.

I can&#39;t be on the server 24/7, so your case you could have notified an admin via WoM forums, WoM contact button or IRC if it really hurt you that bad. I&#39;d be interested to know who did this btw.

Thanks for the good point on trolls posing as us, I will amend this issue right away.

We don&#39;t treat everyone as a griefer, new people join as guests who can build in a small section of the map who are easily promoted to member by following the ingame instructions.

Anyway, thanks for the feedback. Good or bad, I appreciate it."

The bad server was posted due to a number of complaints sent to WoM.

I can&#39;t be on the server 24/7, so your case you could have notified an admin via WoM forums, WoM contact button or IRC if it really hurt you that bad. I&#39;d be interested to know who did this btw.

Thanks for the good point on trolls posing as us, I will amend this issue right away.

We don&#39;t treat everyone as a griefer, new people join as guests who can build in a small section of the map who are easily promoted to member by following the ingame instructions.

Anyway, thanks for the feedback. Good or bad, I appreciate it.[/QUOTE]

People came on and griefed, I ban them, they whine and my server gets put up on your bad servers list.

I suggest you remove it, especially since 3 of the WOM members came on and griefed today."
