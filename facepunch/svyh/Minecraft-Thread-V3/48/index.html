OK, you&#39;re right, I should state what I want from a server.

Here&#39;s a list of things that shouldn&#39;t be happening.

[b]It turns out the text below ended up about three times as big as I expected. for a short version, go to the bottom of this post, if you are venn or one of his OPs, I encourage you to read the long version anyway for various reasons that I will not state in the interest of keeping THIS part short.[/b]

OPblock constructions - I really don&#39;t understand why your OPs do this all the time, what&#39;s even worse is that they designate them as OP only, locking everyone else out. I&#39;ve stated why this is bad before, but allow me to restate it. OPblock constructions are bad because they change OP status from a responsibility to the &quot;cool kids club.&quot; if you make OP more than what it should be you get more demand for OP, from more people who are unqualified, not only that, but normal players hate it when you do that. What&#39;s the point of staying on a server when some of the structures are completely inaccessible?

OPblock abuse - I really fucking love it when your admins make opblock tunnels through my structures, making it inaccessible until I rebuild the part to work around it. you DO NOT want OPs doing this shit, it pisses me off, and it pisses anyone else who isn&#39;t an OP off. Fucking stop it. It also applies to OPs replacing random parts of wall with OPblocks, I would like to tunnel through that, but thanks to some random jackass with OP powers I now can&#39;t. You can create OPblocks, good for you. Now stop demonstrating this by ruining my shit.

Kicking/Banning people for random shit/banning where a kick or even a warning would suffice - I REALLY didn&#39;t think I would need to explain this one to you, but you continue doing it, so the logical conclusion is that either you don&#39;t REALLY give a fuck about your server, or that you don&#39;t know HOW to run a server. I was permabanned for building STAIRS, they weren&#39;t going through any structure, I didn&#39;t know you hated them because you DIDN&#39;T FUCKING SPECIFY THAT ANYWHERE. oh, and your random kicking of people is something I&#39;d expect from a 4channer.

Some griefers will grief the minute they see no value in staying on the server. Doing things that piss them off very much reduces the value of staying on the server, if you treat your players properly (start by not doing the things listed above) you are less likely to be griefed unless you are a public server, which you are NOT.

Here&#39;s what you SHOULD DO

Be polite - do the opposite of the third thing I wanted you to not do. warn people before kicking/banning them. the ONLY exception to this is when what they are doing is obviously, beyond a doubt, GRIEFING. A permaban should be a special event, not something used without second thought and done for any case that there&#39;s a SLIGHT chance that what they are doing is griefing. If you permaban someone for, say, building stairs for an underground area, which MIGHT look like griefing at first, they are not the griefer, YOU ARE.

Be efficient - the only proper use of OPblocks is to build a spawn jail. stop building admin forts, stop using them ANYWHERE outside of a spawn jail. When a group excludes others from the group and the events that that group enjoys, then the outsiders will hate that group for doing so. Why do you think the Jews have faced so much persecution over the years? (NOTE: before people start screaming &quot;GODWIN GODWIN GODWIN GODWIN!!!!,&quot; note that I did not mention nazis, and that they are not the first nor last group to persecute jews.)

Have a plan to kill everyone you meet - don&#39;t be so trusting of your OPs, they could easily be griefing other players behind your back. watch to see if there&#39;s an OP that isn&#39;t doing what they&#39;re supposed to. Banning people for stupid shit/banning people without proper reason? Remove the fucker. Carelessly building through other people&#39;s shit and treating them as trash? Remove the fucker. Many people are perfectly normal until you give them power, then they become dicks.

[b]short version[/b]:
-only use OPblocks for spawn jails, do NOT use them anywhere else in the map.
-only ban when you are totally CERTAIN it&#39;s a griefer, and by ban, I DON&#39;T mean permaban, only permaban in special cases
-watch over your OPs, some of them might be griefers.
-stop pissing people off.
