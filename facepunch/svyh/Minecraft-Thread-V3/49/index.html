Mind adding my server info to the OP venn?

[b]* User commands:[/b] (Admin level 0)
[code][b]/help[/b] - Lists all the available commands for you.
[b]/showself[/b] - Shows your own character, sent through the network as everyone else on the server would see you.
[b]/color[/b] - Lists all of the color codes you can use in chat, more on this later.
[b]/me[/b] - IRC-style action text. ([color=#7f007f]* JTE points and laughs at citricsquid![/color])
[b]/build[/b] - Allows you to build several types of the un-buildable blocks, including grass, ores, the lava sponge, the super sponge, and watervator.
[b]/mute[/b] - Votes to mute the given user by name. For normal users, this command can only be (successfully) used once every half hour, and it takes 3 votes to mute someone. Votes against a user will only go away if they&#39;re unmuted by a server admin.
[b]/where[/b] - Shows your own location in the map, by units of block-size, allowing you to blindly dig towards locations you&#39;ve previously found or just locate your friends in a large-ish map.
[b]/paint[/b] - Whenever you break a block, it immediately gets replaced by whatever block is currently selected before anything else happens. Useful for marking walls beyond which is water, replacing normal user created structures with admin blocks, and painting caves.[/code]

[b]* Build helper commands:[/b] (Admin level 20)
[code][b]/build[/b] - Similar to the normal user version, but can also build &#39;solid&#39; admin blocks, and dynamite.
[b]/solid[/b] - Alias for &#39;/build solid&#39;
[b]/adminbreak[/b] - Toggles your ability to break &#39;solid&#39; blocks, so admins can&#39;t accidentally break seals around lava or Spleef arenas.
[b]/tree[/b] - Place a tree stump, a fully grown tree instantly appears.
[b]/teleport[/b] - Teleport to a user, same as the official server.
[b]/tp[/b] - Alias for /teleport
[b]/dense[/b] - Toggles building dense blocks. They look (and act) the same as normal blocks, but cannot be broken. (They automatically regenerate instantly and never cause water inside them to flood or anything silly like that.) They may be permanently removed with /adminbreak if necessary.
[/code]

[b]* Moderator commands:[/b] (Admin level 50)
[code][b]/say[/b] - Send a global message, same as the official server.
[b]/mute[/b] - Similar to the user mute command, but instant. (Bypasses the voting system, note the lack of /unmute)
[b]/kick[/b] - Same as the official server.
[b]/k[/b] - Alias for /kick
[b]/fetch[/b] - Teleports another user directly to you. (In the future, it may also set their respawn location to where you use this, so they can&#39;t just respawn to get away either.)
[b]/recall[/b] - Alias for /fetch
[b]/ban[/b] - Same as the official server. (Note the lack of /unban)
[b]/banip[/b] - Same as the official server.[/code]

[b]* Admin commands:[/b] (Admin level 100)
[code]In addition to [b]everything[/b] the official server and lower user ranks have...
[b]/hide[/b] - The server silently deletes your character from the list of users and stops sending messages about you as if you had logged out, making you invisible.
[b]/new[/b] - Creates a simple new map of flatgrass-style and loads it, similar to /generate but much faster.
[b]/load[/b] - Loads a previously saved map, by name, without disconnecting anyone.
[b]/unmute[/b] - Un-mutes a user.[/code]

[b]* Server owner Commands:[/b] (Admin level 200)
[code][b]/nick[/b] - This is the big terrible reason why I shouldn&#39;t release this server to the public at the moment: This command allows server admins to change their name to anything, even including color codes and the names of other users. Since a character skin is loaded based on their user name, this means you can easily and effectively &#39;clone&#39; any user you want, including Notch, and the other players can&#39;t tell the difference. (Combine this with /hide and you realize THE ADMIN IS A SPY!!)
[b]/onick[/b] - Similar to /nick, but working on other users, allowing me to give people custom nicks without giving them super-admin status, or to taunt them by changing their name to Zoosmell Pooplord. Whatever.
[b]/build[/b] - Similar to the admin version, but can also build water and lava. Not even your ops can be trusted with these, I&#39;m afraid.
[b]/generate[/b] - Generates a new map of any given size and loads it, in game, same as /load, needs to be reworked and optimized a whole lot in the future...
[b]/config[/b] - Allows you to query and change several game configuration options while the server is running, including whether the server is public, the server&#39;s name and motd, and verify names. (Requires someone who knows exactly what they&#39;re doing, however, as this is very raw access to the server.)[/code]

[b]* Other chat commands:[/b]
[code][b]@&lt;user&gt;[/b] - Sends a private message specifically to one user, such as &quot;@JTE I think bendystraw is causing some trouble...&quot; resulting in JTE seeing &quot;@ Octorok whispers: I think bendystraw is causing some trouble...&quot;
[b]%cX[/b] Adds a color code to your message, where X is 0-9 or a-f, the results according to /color. All of the text following the color code will appear in that color, so &quot;%ccJTE&quot; will produce &quot;JTE&quot; in red.
[b]#[/b] - Sends a message to the entire server, such as &quot;#Hello world!&quot; producing &quot;# JTE shouts: Hello world!&quot;[/code]

[b]* Block types[/b]
[code][b]Lava Sponge[/b] - Like a normal sponge in every way. Except it ignores water and eats lava instead of the other way around.
[b]Dynamite[/b] - Spawns as a red cloth block, waits one second, then destroys all natural blocks (Dirt, grass, stone, sand, gravel, trees) within a 3 block area (7x7x7 cube) around and along with itself. 
[b]Super Sponge[/b] - A sponge that clears both water and lava in a 4 block area (9x9x9 cube). Vely powaful. Lespect him.
[b]Watervator[/b] - A single block of water which can never flood and is unaffected by sponges, only removable by building another block in its place or flooding it out with real water.[/code]

[b]* Server features:[/b]
[code]* Generated maps are much flatter than official servers, and include the &#39;decoration&#39; plants which grow in small patches of flowers, mushrooms, and bushes.
* Bushes and flowers require sunlight and dirt/grass and will die if these needs are not met.
* Mushrooms require only dirt and will happily live in dirt in underground caves as well as on the surface.
* All of these decoration blocks will be crushed out of existence if a sand or gravel block falls on top of them.
* All of these decoration blocks will be washed away by water or lava.
* Sand and gravel will fall through liquids as well, until they reach a solid block.
* Spreading water and lava will only &#39;think&#39; at most 20 times every time they spread, thus making them spread much slower in some cases (and in parts of larger floods, seem to have completely stopped), but the server will [b]never[/b] lag or die from even a full-map flood.
* All generated maps include a one-block layer of solid admin bedrock edging to the bottom and sides, to allow for easy building as well as avoid getting under the un-spongeable water at the edges of the map, and such. It only goes that high, doesn&#39;t block the ocean or sky out, is usually unnoticeable.
* The map is saved every minute while someone is playing on it, and an automatic dated backup is copied to the &quot;backups&quot; folder every 10 minutes, as many admin scripts do. A global announcement with the time stamp is made every time the map gets backed up, so any admins can /load it using that or normal users can tell the admins if there weren&#39;t any around at the time.[/code]

[b]* The Mute system:[/b]
[code]* Muted users appear with a name similar to &quot;[MUTED] JTE&quot;.
* Muted users are unable to chat, unable to build blocks, and unable to break blocks.
* The server completely ignores them, but still sends them messages about other things happening, thus they become a sort of spectator.
* However, their client will still allow them to build and break blocks all they like.
* They can completely grief the entire server if they want. ... It just won&#39;t ever show up for anyone else.[/code][/QUOTE]

[code][05:43] &lt;venn177&gt; I&#39;ve always noticed, always wondered, finally have a chance to ask.
[05:44] &lt;@Notch&gt; it pulls the camera back like 0.2 meters
[05:44] &lt;vede&gt; Yeah I noticed that before.
[05:44] &lt;venn177&gt; Yeah, but WHY? The whole fisheye thing seems a tad pointless.
[05:44] &lt;vede&gt; Why does it do that?
[05:44] &lt;@Notch&gt; it&#39;s to add parallax when looking around
[05:44] &lt;LG_Legacy&gt; Hm... interesting.
[05:44] &lt;vede&gt; Parallax?
[05:44] &lt;LG_Legacy&gt; Twilight MMO? God dammit
[05:44] &lt;LG_Legacy&gt; The worlds coming to an end
[05:44] &lt;venn177&gt; It turned out to be a hoax
[05:44] &lt;@Notch&gt; and when I tried it, I found myself getting much more immersed in the game than with a normal camera
[05:45] &lt;@Notch&gt; so I kept it. :D[/code]

[editline]05:57AM[/editline]

[code][05:53] &lt;venn177&gt; Oh, Notch, I&#39;ve been wondering because of all the conflicting arguments: What&#39;s your stance on custom server edits/flyhacks/etc?
[05:53] &lt;Colain&gt; I has to sleep
[05:53] &lt;vede&gt; One block = 1m and the player = 1.7m right?
[05:53] &lt;Super-Dot&gt; I think most games shy away from using real-world units
[05:54] &lt;JoeyJo0&gt; Why&#39;s that?
[05:54] &lt;Super-Dot&gt; Since everything uses crazy proportions
[05:54] &lt;Plinky&gt; Vede the player can fit on one block I believe right?
[05:54] &lt;venn177&gt; Yes
[05:54] &lt;Super-Dot&gt; Yeah, vede 
[05:54] &lt;LG_Legacy&gt; Huh i just got a crazy idea
[05:54] &lt;vede&gt; Plinky, 1.7 meters vertical.
[05:54] &lt;Visiiri&gt; :O
[05:54] &lt;Plinky&gt; Oh
[05:54] &lt;Super-Dot&gt; How thick is the player?
[05:54] &lt;venn177&gt; one block is 3ftx3ft
[05:54] &lt;@Notch&gt; venn177: Server edits are way cool, but I&#39;m a bit worried about losing creative control before I&#39;m even done with the game.
[05:54] &lt;LG_Legacy&gt; I was right
[05:55] &lt;LG_Legacy&gt; bugmenot has one minecraft account
[05:55] &lt;@Notch&gt; once the game is done, it&#39;s not as important, but I want to have a chance at least.
[05:55] &lt;venn177&gt; Notch: Thank you, I was banning people for flyhacking because the general concensus was that you hated them
[05:55] &lt;Super-Dot&gt; It&#39;s probably banned
[05:55] &lt;@Notch&gt; flyhacks are bad if they&#39;re used to grief, and I will help give tools to prevent it. People will be able to disable the tools if they really like the hacks, though
[05:55] &lt;@Notch&gt; but that&#39;s on a server level[/code]

[06:08] &lt;LG_Legacy&gt; I said it shouldn&#39;t matter whether zuriki is female or not, and to drop the subject.
[06:09] &lt;LG_Legacy&gt; Now if you will actually drop it...

[06:13] &lt;@Notch&gt; no, I&#39;m too big.
