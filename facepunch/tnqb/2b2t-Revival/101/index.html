I understand that, and the playercount at basically all times is 10-30. I&#39;m just trying to say that people wandering around spawn and just killing new players for no reason is discouraging these players from sticking to it. There was one player the other day that logged in, and was repeatedly killed because he was using the default skin, and as far as I know, he hasn&#39;t been back on. 

I&#39;ve been playing on this server off and on for a year. I understand that some things are just part of 2b2t, as I&#39;ve been griefed countless times and have seen what all happens. But I&#39;m not blinded by &quot;Well, that&#39;s just 2b2t&quot; to see that there are some things players are doing that are forcing new players away."

NO it hasn&#39;t.

I escaped their last night even with Redcrew being at spawn in diamond gear killing people. I got out on maybe the 4th try in a matter of maybe 6 mins. Even after running from it out of radar range I got 1500 blocks out of spawn. And thats after being burnt from lava.

Also even if 2b2t does ever close down, who cares. I had fun so far and isn&#39;t that the whole point?
