I found two chunks that slime spawn in using a website that checks the seed of the server and tells you the chunks that slimes spawn in. Then I went down well below block 40 to block 17, and mined out part of two back to back slime spawning chunks. Each section I mined was 16x16x5, but they were connected, making a 16x32x5 space. Before I finished the room, I went up a ladder to my base to fetch some supplies, went back down the ladder and there were three slimes and several endermen in the room. I killed all of those, then put up some torches. I then waited about 30 blocks away for slimes to spawn for two hours. I came back and slimes had not spawned. I figured the torches were prohibiting slimes from spawning, so I removed them and tried again. This time, not only had slimes not spawned, NOTHING spawned at all, not even hostile mobs. I tried again, decreasing the distance to the chunks, which still did not work.

I&#39;ve been wondering about that lately
A week a go i did a test.
I sealed 2 of each passive mobs in a 10x10x5 box at bedrock
I checked it today, both cows, 1 pig, both sheep and 1 wolf were gone
Any ideas?
Most likely it was magnets.

[URL=&quot;http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Spawn#Mob_Spawning&quot;]Accoridng to the wiki[/URL], the mob caps for the server are calclauted server-wide.

For the total number of loaded chunks across all players, divide that count by 256 and multiply by 70 to get the total number of hostile mobs that can spawn throughout the server.  So each player should be receiving 8 chunk radius (?) from the server, which is ~289 chunks per player, minus players&#39; chunks who are grouped up in the same area.

I can&#39;t find any information saying the actual spawners spawn based on the hostile mob count, so they probably do not.

So for example, you have 80 players on the server.  There&#39;s a few groups of people together working so effectively there are 60 players spread across the server.  That&#39;s 60 * 289 = 17340 chunks.  Divide by 256 = 18.3 then multiply by the constant for hostile mobs (70) = and you get a mob cap of 1281 mobs.

Now if you have only 6 people at mob spawners with ~200 mobs currently spawned... that leaves 81 mobs to be spawned across the remaining chunks for all 80 players.  It should not be a surprise if no mobs spawn at all in your area in this case, even at night; especially slimes, which only spawn 1/10th as often as other hostile mobs."
