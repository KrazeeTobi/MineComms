Yea, but there is still like 23 days or something of the month left for people to donate, and as long as people have at least helped pay for the server, like at least half of the cost or more, than it wont be that big of a expense for house. If no one donates than yea, house might not be able to keep the server running for long. Its a shame to see the server pop dwindle back down to 20 or so players, but those are the people who are dedicated long time players mostly."

Oh, and make lava ponds above his chests to keep them save from griefers.

The reason there is literally no decoration is because I got there literally a few days ago and have probably spent all of 4 hours on the island. And that time has been spent setting up food supplies and gathering building materials. Function over form in my book. Then form gets worked on. 
Still I love the look of mushroom biomes. 
Make sure to keep breeding the cows.

Well, I did spend time decorating/ terraforming. 
Clearing and making sure the dirt paths where the grass will grow took ages. Guess it could be called decorating."
