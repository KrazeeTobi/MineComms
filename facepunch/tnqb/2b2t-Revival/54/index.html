I was going to build that out of gold blocks with Diamond veins running up and down it.
The white was going to be iron blocks.

Don&#39;t bother asking people for help on the chat because that&#39;s never gonna happen. Just go box some skeletons. That&#39;s pretty much all you need, especially if you&#39;ve already found old farms.

Edit: Also I really don&#39;t understand why so many people insist on walking out of spawn when there&#39;s usually at least one working nether portal SOMEWHERE in the vicinity, unless someone&#39;s purposefully hunted every last one down recently (and there&#39;s quite a few strewn about so I doubt it, usually just the ones right at the exit get broken). I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but the ghast spawn rate seems[I] incredibly [/I]low so unless you habitually jump off ledges without looking or poke mutants wandering around with swords it&#39;s not that dangerous."

Don&#39;t bother asking people for help on the chat because that&#39;s never gonna happen. Just go box some skeletons. That&#39;s pretty much all you need, especially if you&#39;ve already found old farms.

Edit: Also I really don&#39;t understand why so many people insist on walking out of spawn when there&#39;s usually at least one working nether portal SOMEWHERE in the vicinity, unless someone&#39;s purposefully hunted every last one down recently (and there&#39;s quite a few strewn about so I doubt it, usually just the ones right at the exit get broken). I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just me but the ghast spawn rate seems[I] incredibly [/I]low so unless you habitually jump off ledges without looking or poke mutants wandering around with swords it&#39;s not that dangerous.</span>

Ah, you are FP to.

I sended you PM with some small hideouts I have/had/used close to spawn which still had stuff 3 days ago, hopefully 1 still has food, expect many to be raided. (I wanted to see xcc2&#39;s place myself, so went near spawn for a while.)

As they will not last long anyway, they might help you out.

I sended you PM with some small hideouts I have/had/used close to spawn which still had stuff 3 days ago, hopefully 1 still has food, expect many to be raided. (I wanted to see xcc2&#39;s place myself, so went near spawn for a while.)

As they will not last long anyway, they might help you out.

edit: Hmm, the &quot;send Messages&quot; folder does not show me a message. If I you did not receive one tell me</span>

I find it improbable that you&#39;ve made it to 12k and haven&#39;t come across any food whatsoever to keep you going. I&#39;ve found bases loaded with food before that weren&#39;t even 2k out. I also found some mushrooms and now I got food to last me for years. Hell, I haven&#39;t even made it to 10k and I have iron armor/tools and tons of food.

Also, cows have a 100% chance of dropping at least 1 steak, so I don&#39;t know what you mean when you said cows dropped no food.

&quot;No one will help me on the server&quot; - I don&#39;t know what to make of this. Nobody wants anything to do with other people half the time. If you tell someone your coords they will just kill you, so it&#39;s not going to happen.

I kindly asked someone at spawn for food and they gave me 4 bread. Not much right? I only jumped when I had to. If I see a cliff, I walk around it and not try to scale the cliff face."
