As for making/keeping safe points, In my experience it is better make 
multiple small points a bit further away (at least 1k) with minimal resource. 

This way it also doesn&#39;t hurt to much to give coordinates for one of 
them away here in forum or even as whisper ingame.

If I am in the mood I do the same, currently those bases are abandoned

Sounds like you got the easiest way out possible. My second time out of spawn, I couldn&#39;t get any bonemeal because there was a massive spike in players because the facepunchers started to come back and leaving my shitty hole in the ground meant certain death. I had to salvage a wrecked wheat farm and wait for wheat to grow while people walked around aboveground. Eventually I got killed by a ~pr0 mlg~ raider, but at least he was too busy going to spawn to destroy the wheat."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=endorphinsam;35890804]Man, so many people found the easy way out of spawn. Finding people that were nice enough to lend food, random chests with goodies

You want to know how I made it out?

I was just walking with about two health, all of a sudden I saw a watermelon item just laying on the ground next to tilled dirt. It was like the luckiest thing ever, and the hardest thing ever since it was right by spawn and I didnt have any wood. :( took me forever to get started when I see stories like this where people just find this awesome shit and are set for entire virtua life in 2b2t[/QUOTE]
Sounds like you got the easiest way out possible. My second time out of spawn, I couldn&#39;t get any bonemeal because there was a massive spike in players because the facepunchers started to come back and leaving my shitty hole in the ground meant certain death. I had to salvage a wrecked wheat farm and wait for wheat to grow while people walked around aboveground. Eventually I got killed by a ~pr0 mlg~ raider, but at least he was too busy going to spawn to destroy the wheat.</span>
