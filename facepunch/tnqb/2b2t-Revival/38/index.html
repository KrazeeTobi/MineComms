This guy is a PRIME example of what all you asshole newfags should be doing.

Stop bitching about the lava at spawn, man the fuck up, and find a way out of spawn, get some basic food that&#39;s EASILY findable within the first 1k blocks of spawn, and start getting materials so you don&#39;t get fucked. If you want to get somewhere on 2b2t, you have to work for it.

Thank you for being logical and reasonable
When i joined a couple months i knew what i was getting into i only said: &quot;wow. spawn is fucked&quot; when i first spawned in.
I spent the next hour concentrating on making it 500 blocks away and gathering meager supplies in a chest, then dying immediately.
Get 2 zombie flesh; eat 1 put other in abandoned chest.
die, respawn, make it back out
Kill a spider, put string in said chest.
I kept that up till i got a bed, got a new spawn point
Then i ran for the fucking hills.
Haven&#39;t looked back since.
Spawn is shit. It&#39;s worse now than back in January. Still, as long as you can leave the crater, you have no right to bitch or moan. We&#39;ve all done it and it&#39;s still just as hard.

While I agree with you for the most part, it does get pretty impossible when you always spawn directly IN lava. There&#39;s not really anything you can do to avoid death in that case, expecially when there are also several full-diamond-armor players trying to kill you as well. I think that lava should at least be blocked from being on the spawn. (I wasn&#39;t one of the people getting spawnkilled by the way)"

While I agree with you for the most part, it does get pretty impossible when you always spawn directly IN lava. There&#39;s not really anything you can do to avoid death in that case, expecially when there are also several full-diamond-armor players trying to kill you as well. I think that lava should at least be blocked from being on the spawn. (I wasn&#39;t one of the people getting spawnkilled by the way)</span>

My argument for keeping the lava at spawn is simple: 2b2t is &quot;supposed&quot; to be an anarchy server, where anything goes. If people don&#39;t want new players on and lava the entire spawn, so be it. Eventually they&#39;ll realize that new players help the server grow, and they&#39;ll fix this. Of course, &quot;eventually&quot; in terms of 2b2t would be quite a long time, but that&#39;s how anarchy works; no rules and anything goes, take it or leave it. Yes, I realize that&#39;s a stupid argument when it comes to Minecraft, but considering all of the idiots whining about not being able to leave spawn even when there isn&#39;t lava there, and there are plenty available tunnels to escape, I think throwing lava all over spawn helps weed out the morons, at least temporarily. 

It&#39;s a give and take sort of thing, and the only person who makes the solution(s) is Hause since it&#39;s his server and even though it&#39;s &quot;no rules,&quot; he can do whatever the fuck he wants with it. So far Hause&#39;s policy has been to remedy spawn so new players can at least spawn without being killed instantly by lava. Newfags should be thankful for this. And, because of this fact that Hause tries to make it so new players can at least spawn, they bitch about it anyway. This is where the moaning and whining crosses the line of idiocy.

It&#39;s not difficult to distinguish an unreliable source from one that is trusted; this goes for anything, not just Minecraft clients. 

[QUOTE=Zero-Point;35549967]So people who used piston duping should have their items removed? How do you determine who dupe&#39;d and who didn&#39;t?[/quote]
I&#39;m not talking about duped items. That was all going on like a year ago and it would pretty much be impossible to distinguished duped things from non-duped things. I&#39;m talking about people who managed to get OP privileges and spawned items that give them unfair advantages one way or another. I&#39;m not trying to pin-point anybody, but the simple fact that this has happened should be obvious to anybody that it&#39;s wrong and should be (or should have been) reverted. Why Hause didn&#39;t load a backup when this happened instead of only getting rid of some of the spawned-in items, I don&#39;t know.

It&#39;s not difficult to distinguish an unreliable source from one that is trusted; this goes for anything, not just Minecraft clients. 

[QUOTE=Zero-Point;35549967]So people who used piston duping should have their items removed? How do you determine who dupe&#39;d and who didn&#39;t?[/quote]
I&#39;m not talking about duped items. That was all going on like a year ago and it would pretty much be impossible to distinguished duped things from non-duped things. I&#39;m talking about people who managed to get OP privileges and spawned items that give them unfair advantages one way or another. I&#39;m not trying to pin-point anybody, but the simple fact that this has happened should be obvious to anybody that it&#39;s wrong and should be (or should have been) reverted. Why Hause didn&#39;t load a backup when this happened instead of only getting rid of some of the spawned-in items, I don&#39;t know.

There is the remains of what appears to be a lighthouse on it. I&#39;m thinking of maybe staying here and inviting a few oldfag buddies to come help me repair it.

Anyone know anything about the history of this base? It looks pretty old judging from the generation around it (although that does not necessarily mean the base is old) and it&#39;s barely grieved at all. Oh, and there was one sign, it said &quot;whatever the circumstances, you must leave a sign here.&quot; which is funny because there were no other signs there."

                            <span v-pre>I was leaving the little island I had been dicking around at for a week and walking on a nether road. I came across a random portal on the road. I always like to check things out, so I went and had a look and this is honestly one of the coolest things I have seen on 2b2t.

There is the remains of what appears to be a lighthouse on it. I&#39;m thinking of maybe staying here and inviting a few oldfag buddies to come help me repair it.

And here&#39;s a pretty cool freecam shot.

Anyone know anything about the history of this base? It looks pretty old judging from the generation around it (although that does not necessarily mean the base is old) and it&#39;s barely grieved at all. Oh, and there was one sign, it said &quot;whatever the circumstances, you must leave a sign here.&quot; which is funny because there were no other signs there.</span>

When i get time to sit down and really get going, you won&#39;t recognize the place.

I remember passing by there once last year. When I visited there were tons of signs up and loads of supplies. I think I have some screenshots of it intact around somewhere.

Also just spent about two hours building this fairly pointless vertical farm underground.
The yield was in no way proportionate to the effort it took to build.
