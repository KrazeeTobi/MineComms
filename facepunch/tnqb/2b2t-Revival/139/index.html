Java&#39;s a scripting language, not an engine per-se. Alot of the performance issues seem to be due to stupid shit left-over by Notch such as reloading the texture file every single frame. (I mean seriously, what the mother-bloody buttfuck made him think this was a good idea?)"

                        <postrender input="I&#39;m sorry, I really tried to love 2b2t.net, I tried to force myself into the 2b2t experience, but ultimately it was shit.
I guess it was my own fault for seeking a hardcore pvp or &quot;anarchy&quot; experience.
Allowing people to use hacks is a terrible, terrible start. If you don&#39;t use hacks yourself, you&#39;re at a disadvantage. And a very big one at that, because since ANYBODY can x-ray and noclip freecam at will, you have literally no chance of having a base anywhere that is not 100k blocks or more from spawn. And at that point, it literally doesn&#39;t get any better.
There is not a single gram of PVP. I could not even witness in chat any instance of two armored people fighting, the only kill notices were of veteran players spawncamping any newcomers zealously.
This had a base on the mentality of the server itself, since if at any time ANYBODY had a rough sketch of where your base was, they&#39;d xray into it, and blow it up with duped TNT that they got out of sand generators and hacked books with Sharpness and Looting 17000. Oh, right, and certain regulars had doublechests FULL of duped supplies from previous exploits that went unregulated due to no admin presence.
If you want any chance of surviving in this server, provided you managed to escape the spawn that the players rabidly try to make the most inhospitable possible, you essentially want to play Singleplayer in a terribly laggy server with a fucked up community.
Oh, the community. Seriously, every single player there had serious problems. A good bunch of them admitted to watching CP in onionpedo, found some of the biggest attention whores I&#39;ve seen, some fucks in particular were spewing an amount of racism and general obscenities (generally regarding Obama and Islam) just so fucking thick and dense you literally couldn&#39;t tell whether they actually had an opinion or not anymore. Others were wasted out of their asses and wouldn&#39;t shut up about how much they loved drugs and how they had relationship issues.
In the end, the only positive thing I can rescue from this server was the &quot;extremely fucked up spawn&quot; aspect, and seeing years of player erosion and construction on the same map. Even then, there were next to no worthwhile ruins, due to the scattering of players and near-infinite availability of TNT to veterans.
I know you all will jump on my post, give me boxes, and claim that I am a frustrated spawnfag, but I still want to give my two cents on this server, and why it is one of the experiences that in the end, you wish you never had. No, I didn&#39;t have my base raided, I didn&#39;t get aura-killed by someone with a book, in fact, I played smart and remained unfound for over a week and half AT 5K, 0, comfy in someone else&#39;s huge castle walls. But I don&#39;t have anything to prove anymore, I&#39;m just done with this.
Also, LordCarver, thanks for your invitation but I won&#39;t be logging in. Your coords are safe.


[I]Hause is making some interesting ratings around here, I am glad he could read this, so I urge him to give his two cents as well.[/I]"

I guess it was my own fault for seeking a hardcore pvp or &quot;anarchy&quot; experience.
Allowing people to use hacks is a terrible, terrible start. If you don&#39;t use hacks yourself, you&#39;re at a disadvantage. And a very big one at that, because since ANYBODY can x-ray and noclip freecam at will, you have literally no chance of having a base anywhere that is not 100k blocks or more from spawn. And at that point, it literally doesn&#39;t get any better.
There is not a single gram of PVP. I could not even witness in chat any instance of two armored people fighting, the only kill notices were of veteran players spawncamping any newcomers zealously.
This had a base on the mentality of the server itself, since if at any time ANYBODY had a rough sketch of where your base was, they&#39;d xray into it, and blow it up with duped TNT that they got out of sand generators and hacked books with Sharpness and Looting 17000. Oh, right, and certain regulars had doublechests FULL of duped supplies from previous exploits that went unregulated due to no admin presence.
If you want any chance of surviving in this server, provided you managed to escape the spawn that the players rabidly try to make the most inhospitable possible, you essentially want to play Singleplayer in a terribly laggy server with a fucked up community.
Oh, the community. Seriously, every single player there had serious problems. A good bunch of them admitted to watching CP in onionpedo, found some of the biggest attention whores I&#39;ve seen, some fucks in particular were spewing an amount of racism and general obscenities (generally regarding Obama and Islam) just so fucking thick and dense you literally couldn&#39;t tell whether they actually had an opinion or not anymore. Others were wasted out of their asses and wouldn&#39;t shut up about how much they loved drugs and how they had relationship issues.
In the end, the only positive thing I can rescue from this server was the &quot;extremely fucked up spawn&quot; aspect, and seeing years of player erosion and construction on the same map. Even then, there were next to no worthwhile ruins, due to the scattering of players and near-infinite availability of TNT to veterans.
I know you all will jump on my post, give me boxes, and claim that I am a frustrated spawnfag, but I still want to give my two cents on this server, and why it is one of the experiences that in the end, you wish you never had. No, I didn&#39;t have my base raided, I didn&#39;t get aura-killed by someone with a book, in fact, I played smart and remained unfound for over a week and half AT 5K, 0, comfy in someone else&#39;s huge castle walls. But I don&#39;t have anything to prove anymore, I&#39;m just done with this.

It all depends on how smart you are. Willingly giving out your coords will get you found at any distance, and you can survive for months at 10k, let alone 100

Also I think haus is a [del]pretty cool dude[/del] faggot, but honestly if he cared about what we said, or who we were, the server would have been gone long ago. Not even by choice either, the bill for his server is about $80, he pays out of his (donation munny) pockets to support people who call him a greedy jew."

I guess it was my own fault for seeking a hardcore pvp or &quot;anarchy&quot; experience.
Allowing people to use hacks is a terrible, terrible start. If you don&#39;t use hacks yourself, you&#39;re at a disadvantage. And a very big one at that, because since ANYBODY can x-ray and noclip freecam at will, you have literally no chance of having a base anywhere that is not 100k blocks or more from spawn. And at that point, it literally doesn&#39;t get any better.
There is not a single gram of PVP. I could not even witness in chat any instance of two armored people fighting, the only kill notices were of veteran players spawncamping any newcomers zealously.
This had a base on the mentality of the server itself, since if at any time ANYBODY had a rough sketch of where your base was, they&#39;d xray into it, and blow it up with duped TNT that they got out of sand generators and hacked books with Sharpness and Looting 17000. Oh, right, and certain regulars had doublechests FULL of duped supplies from previous exploits that went unregulated due to no admin presence.
If you want any chance of surviving in this server, provided you managed to escape the spawn that the players rabidly try to make the most inhospitable possible, you essentially want to play Singleplayer in a terribly laggy server with a fucked up community.
Oh, the community. Seriously, every single player there had serious problems. A good bunch of them admitted to watching CP in onionpedo, found some of the biggest attention whores I&#39;ve seen, some fucks in particular were spewing an amount of racism and general obscenities (generally regarding Obama and Islam) just so fucking thick and dense you literally couldn&#39;t tell whether they actually had an opinion or not anymore. Others were wasted out of their asses and wouldn&#39;t shut up about how much they loved drugs and how they had relationship issues.
In the end, the only positive thing I can rescue from this server was the &quot;extremely fucked up spawn&quot; aspect, and seeing years of player erosion and construction on the same map. Even then, there were next to no worthwhile ruins, due to the scattering of players and near-infinite availability of TNT to veterans.
I know you all will jump on my post, give me boxes, and claim that I am a frustrated spawnfag, but I still want to give my two cents on this server, and why it is one of the experiences that in the end, you wish you never had. No, I didn&#39;t have my base raided, I didn&#39;t get aura-killed by someone with a book, in fact, I played smart and remained unfound for over a week and half AT 5K, 0, comfy in someone else&#39;s huge castle walls. But I don&#39;t have anything to prove anymore, I&#39;m just done with this.

A good bunch of them admitted to watching CP in onionpedo, found some of the biggest attention whores I&#39;ve seen, some fucks in particular were spewing an amount of racism and general obscenities (generally regarding Obama and Islam) just so fucking thick and dense you literally couldn&#39;t tell whether they actually had an opinion or not anymore. Others were wasted out of their asses and wouldn&#39;t shut up about how much they loved drugs and how they had relationship issues.
In the end, the only positive thing I can rescue from this server was the &quot;extremely fucked up spawn&quot; aspect, and seeing years of player erosion and construction on the same map. Even then, there were next to no worthwhile ruins, due to the scattering of players and near-infinite availability of TNT to veterans.
I know you all will jump on my post, give me boxes, and claim that I am a frustrated spawnfag, but I still want to give my two cents on this server, and why it is one of the experiences that in the end, you wish you never had. No, I didn&#39;t have my base raided, I didn&#39;t get aura-killed by someone with a book, in fact, I played smart and remained unfound for over a week and half AT 5K, 0, comfy in someone else&#39;s huge castle walls. But I don&#39;t have anything to prove anymore, I&#39;m just done with this.
Also, LordCarver, thanks for your invitation but I won&#39;t be logging in. Your coords are safe.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=9600bauds;38269991]I&#39;m sorry, I really tried to love 2b2t.net, I tried to force myself into the 2b2t experience, but ultimately it was shit.
I guess it was my own fault for seeking a hardcore pvp or &quot;anarchy&quot; experience.
Allowing people to use hacks is a terrible, terrible start. If you don&#39;t use hacks yourself, you&#39;re at a disadvantage. And a very big one at that, because since ANYBODY can x-ray and noclip freecam at will, you have literally no chance of having a base anywhere that is not 100k blocks or more from spawn. And at that point, it literally doesn&#39;t get any better.
There is not a single gram of PVP. I could not even witness in chat any instance of two armored people fighting, the only kill notices were of veteran players spawncamping any newcomers zealously.
This had a base on the mentality of the server itself, since if at any time ANYBODY had a rough sketch of where your base was, they&#39;d xray into it, and blow it up with duped TNT that they got out of sand generators and hacked books with Sharpness and Looting 17000. Oh, right, and certain regulars had doublechests FULL of duped supplies from previous exploits that went unregulated due to no admin presence.
If you want any chance of surviving in this server, provided you managed to escape the spawn that the players rabidly try to make the most inhospitable possible, you essentially want to play Singleplayer in a terribly laggy server with a fucked up community.
