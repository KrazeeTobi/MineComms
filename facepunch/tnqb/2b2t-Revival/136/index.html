Update got it down.

[editline]29th October 2012[/editline]

[QUOTE=potatomaster;38238528]maybe the fact that 2b2t is down, could have caused the massive drop in players. we should GET 2B2T BACK UP! AND lava spawn more.. this should increase number of players on at any given time, as who doesn&#39;t enjoy spawnfag death messages and listening to their screams for help in chat.[/QUOTE]

lol that was a joke. i am very aware that hause wouldnt spawn me anything if i begged him to. i never claimed to be an oldfag and i spawncamp only when i have absolutely nothing better to do. but i do think spawn is a bit too easy at the moment, and i do not think i am the only one who thinks this. chill out bro."
