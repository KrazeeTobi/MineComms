So I log on to 2b2t today with the intent of visiting 2k2k. After getting out of spawn relatively easy I find a nether portal and start to make my into the negatives. Shortly thereafter I make it to the gutted mass of stone that barely resembles a mountain completely devoid of anything useful. I&#39;m starting to get hungry so I kill a few zombies and pigs for their meat and I decide to go farther in the nether. For a while I travel with a good bit of food searching for another portal to the overworld. It seems like I&#39;m going on forever though these carved paths of others before me. Not too long after that I realize I&#39;m running way low on food. I&#39;m starting to feel like I&#39;m not going to make it out alive when I find a portal but my bad luck reveals it&#39;s been broken. I travel on for a little bit more and eat my last piece of zombie meat and I&#39;m really worried I&#39;m not going to make it out alive. But in the distance I see the edge of obsidian over a lava lake so I move to the side to see if it&#39;s still working. Yes it is. Now all I have to do is get to it. There&#39;s no straight footpath there so I push my luck by going though tunnels mined by others. The one I choose doesn&#39;t lead me the right way and I&#39;m now lost in a nether cave without a sense of direction. I start to panic. My hunger bar is halfway gone with no food left. My stone pickaxe is red and I don&#39;t know where I came from. I desperately search every direction in this cave looking for a way out but all I&#39;m finding are dead ends. It should have been right there. I saw my exit. How could I have fucked this up. I&#39;m going to die and have to walk out here all over again. But the whole time I was also thinking I was going to make it out alive. Sure enough I somehow find a path out of the cave but at first the portal is nowhere in sight. I move out into the open and spot it again, and this time I can walk to it. I hop in the portal and arrive tens of thousands of blocks away from spawn. I kill a pig and save myself from hunger and I start to mine. I find some iron ore so I make a sword and keep moving. After a few thousand more blocks I stumble upon this strange sight.

Moving around that I stumble upon this really beaten down house

[thumb]https://dl.dropbox.com/u/25698984/2b2t2.jpg[/thumb]

Now I&#39;m excited to see this abandoned base at such a far out location but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s got nothing of value left inside. I take a look around and find it&#39;s mostly empty with broken glass but there are two double chests. Inside I find some normal things like wood coal and redstone but nothing that is really going to make my life easier. I start to cook more pork when I turn around to make sure no mob was at my back. This is when I notice in the corner a pile of items that I hadn&#39;t seen there before. Out loud I say &quot;no fucking way&quot; as I see the hint of cyan diamond laying there on the ground mixed in with the gray of iron and red of tnt. I couldn&#39;t believe this had happened. I found a diamond sword, 50 iron bars, 13 diamonds, a full set of iron armor. This will never happen to me again. I didn&#39;t know what to do with my newly found riches so I just exited the game and wrote this here.

What you&#39;re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I&#39;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called &quot;Linux&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#39;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called &quot;Linux&quot; distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=zxcwbz1;38551232]What you&#39;re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I&#39;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called &quot;Linux&quot;, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#39;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called &quot;Linux&quot; distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.[/QUOTE]
