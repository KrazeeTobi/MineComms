When I was last there, not a week ago I could leave spawn at the +x,+y side. 
When you stood before the lava, to the right was a small bridge (3 wide, 20 blocks long) 
it must still be there, as it was in the protected part.

Following this direction slightly keeping left at first, once out of direct spawn, keep more right/up and there were 1 or 2 good paths leading straight out. (Those are not protected, so they might be messed up.

Once out, you can circle around spawn and go any direction you wish.

in the +x,+y somebody maintained a base not far out with trees and wheat, 
well within 1k.

Otherwise a tree and a few spiders will give you access to fish for dinner.

When I was last there, not a week ago I could leave spawn at the +x,+y side. 
When you stood before the lava, to the right was a small bridge (3 wide, 20 blocks long) 
it must still be there, as it was in the protected part.

Following this direction slightly keeping left at first, once out of direct spawn, keep more right/up and there were 1 or 2 good paths leading straight out. (Those are not protected, so they might be messed up.

Once out, you can circle around spawn and go any direction you wish.

in the +x,+y somebody maintained a base not far out with trees and wheat, 
well within 1k.

Otherwise a tree and a few spiders will give you access to fish for dinner.

                            <span v-pre>I would offer to share my place, but you can&#39;t trust anyone.

You need to find those people whoa re helpful. My current base, i built first time I was on the server, and I saved the coords, went back to spawn. After I&#39;d gander 6 months, I return to the base to see someone had left a sign saying &quot;Thanks, this place saved my life. I would have starved. -(guys name)&quot; He left me some iron armor and some whatnots without hurting the base.

Currently I have some basic resources and a farm. It&#39;s not very notable.</span>

When you stood before the lava, to the right was a small bridge (3 wide, 20 blocks long) 
it must still be there, as it was in the protected part.

Following this direction slightly keeping left at first, once out of direct spawn, keep more right/up and there were 1 or 2 good paths leading straight out. (Those are not protected, so they might be messed up.

Once out, you can circle around spawn and go any direction you wish.

in the +x,+y somebody maintained a base not far out with trees and wheat, 
well within 1k.

Otherwise a tree and a few spiders will give you access to fish for dinner.
