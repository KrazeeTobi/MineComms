Theres enough magma cream there that work can begin on that blaze spawner. 

This tim im not setting a bed though. Making that walk to and from kinda sucks.[/QUOTE]

I don&#39;t do skype that much. 

Anyways I dropped off the 19 stacks of pork and 6 stacks of glowstone. I also srroudned one of the blaze spawners with cobblestone so its deactivare. The XP farm is ready to be bulit on it. Flamereaper built the one at the old base me him and Omal shared.

However I had to/decided to kill the 2nd spawn er in that area. I think they were far enough away both couldn&#39;t be activate at the same time. While fighting a blaze I accidentally shot a pigman and they ganged raped me back to my base. 

I also started to bulid walls around the spwaner area so you guys can work in peace without ghasts or other blaze shooting you. also theres 6 8 min anti fire/lava potions in that main house on the stands. As well as 12 more megma cream in the chest by it."

Hold up.
You made a portal on the shroom and neutralized a blaze spawner? Thanks. 
It wasn&#39;t my plan, because of the SNAFU at Divercity I really didn&#39;t want a portal to the island. 
You do know the grifer found Divercity via the nether right?
If knight and sleep say yes, then so be it. Majority rules. 
The nether is the easiest way of finding us, considering the island is in the middle of nowhere. In the nether it&#39;s a he&#39;ll of a lot easier to find a portal using X-ray, or a whole facility surrounding a blaze grinder like what I built before, and I made sure that what we had was invisible withoutxray, covered it all in netherrack. We really could use a blaze grinder but I&#39;m thinking risk( discovery and destruction of the shroom) vs reward( best XP drop in the game and unlimited blazerods)

The chances of anyone finding us through the nether is very slim. Most people AFK through the roof so the likelihood of a live player finding it is not very high. If anything we can get as many blaze rods as we want, and get as much XP as we want; even remove it all whenever we feel that it&#39;s no longer needed.

My only worries are that the aesthetics of the island become unnatural. I really want to get rid of all the cobblestone around the island, and fill any missing holes.
I&#39;m going to move the bookcase and the melons because their placement doesn&#39;t fit. Fire2box, try to keep in touch with me before you do any major changes. I love all the help &lt;3"

What he said is true when going from my base to yours I AFK for most of it. Plus on normal distance view you can hardly see anything. At most I say don&#39;t put chests or any containers in the nether. Also a huge block of netherrack wouldn&#39;t look normal on X-ray either. 


Also the greifer din&#39;t find &quot;divercity&quot; by chance Omal was pretty much giving away the cords to whoever he felt like since he was getting bored likely by not working on any of the good, useful projects. he told us both on skype he gave the cords to popbob. as well as like 2 other people.

[QUOTE=KnightVista;36733317]The chances of anyone finding us through the nether is very slim. Most people AFK through the roof so the likelihood of a live player finding it is not very high. If anything we can get as many blaze rods as we want, and get as much XP as we want; even remove it all whenever we feel that it&#39;s no longer needed.

My only worries are that the aesthetics of the island become unnatural. I really want to get rid of all the cobblestone around the island, and fill any missing holes.
I&#39;m going to move the bookcase and the melons because their placement doesn&#39;t fit. Fire2box, try to keep in touch with me before you do any major changes. I love all the help &lt;3[/QUOTE]
 
I didn&#39;tt place anything other then the new portal which was a accident of where it is lol.

Then I put coubble stone to mark the skelton farm. All i&#39;ve really done was expand the far out cane farm and start work on the blaze farm."

What he said is true when going from my base to yours I AFK for most of it. Plus on normal distance view you can hardly see anything. At most I say don&#39;t put chests or any containers in the nether. Also a huge block of netherrack wouldn&#39;t look normal on X-ray either. 


Also the greifer din&#39;t find &quot;divercity&quot; by chance Omal was pretty much giving away the cords to whoever he felt like since he was getting bored likely by not working on any of the good, useful projects. he told us both on skype he gave the cords to popbob. as well as like 2 other people.

[QUOTE=KnightVista;36733317]The chances of anyone finding us through the nether is very slim. Most people AFK through the roof so the likelihood of a live player finding it is not very high. If anything we can get as many blaze rods as we want, and get as much XP as we want; even remove it all whenever we feel that it&#39;s no longer needed.

My only worries are that the aesthetics of the island become unnatural. I really want to get rid of all the cobblestone around the island, and fill any missing holes.
I&#39;m going to move the bookcase and the melons because their placement doesn&#39;t fit. Fire2box, try to keep in touch with me before you do any major changes. I love all the help &lt;3[/QUOTE]
 
I didn&#39;tt place anything other then the new portal which was a accident of where it is lol.

Then I put coubble stone to mark the skelton farm. All i&#39;ve really done was expand the far out cane farm and start work on the blaze farm.</span>
