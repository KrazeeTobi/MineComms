Unless people managed to place blocks or cover the openings with lava in the last 48 hours (entirely possible mind you) there are at least 4 different exists from spawn.

[QUOTE=marco_q73;35452553]Just to be correct, isn&#39;t that all blocks from spawn to 10k (in a circle, not square).

Be aware, if you say you are pretty much exact 10k or 20k out somebody does not need 
to search the whole area, just the border. Which is much much less as what you calculated.
To protect yourself against this, don&#39;t tell the exact distance but be wrong for at least 5k[/QUOTE]

What I calculated was basically picking a random block within render distance of any 10K block on either the X or Z coordinates.  Not necessarily exploring a certain number of blocks.  To be technically correct on percent chance of finding a base simply by walking outwards from spawn, you would have to calculate the arc length ratio of your base compared to the entire length of blocks at your distance.  This would be a smaller number than what I arrived at by at least half I would think..."

Anything that depends on the server processing is not &quot;hackable&quot; on 2b2t afaik.  Things that the server can check to make sure you aren&#39;t hacking, such as flying, speed, step height, fall damage immune, etc. are not possible on 2b2t.  Things that are purely client-based are completely possible: chest finder, xray, freecam, auto-mine, auto-tool, force field, etc.

It really is disappointing to see what some players have the abilities to do because of Nodus and other hacked clients.  A 100% legit Minecraft experience would be quite preferable in my opinion.  Playing Minecraft with Nodus isn&#39;t even Minecraft anymore, it&#39;s Noduscraft."

did you mean &quot;minecart chests&quot; or just plain chests?


I forgot, what about beds or dispencers.

I just had some time (as the server is offline) to look for more 
inventive ways of hiding stuff.

For me, most important is bed + gear.
Now, for a bed I&#39;ve no problem putting it at 10k+. 
Bad luck if it&#39;s found, but I check enough to make sure one is there.
(Can I have multiple bed&#39;s. or does only the last work?)

But for gear it would be nice to have places which can be closer to 
spawn, at least with a reasonable chance to be overlooked.

Like hiding within ore or bedrock, but if it&#39;s outlined from great distance 
that&#39;s useless. (They will not be perfect otherwise, but that&#39;s acceptable)

Alternatively I might consider placing many empty chest as decoy.

Yes I did mean minecart chests,sorry.If you sleep in one bed,and then sleep in another,you will spawn at the second bed you slept in - and if the second bed was destroyed and you died you would respawn at spawn.You can set xrays to detect pretty much anything,although some people might not have theirs set to detect hidden dispensers and they might just ignore them."

did you mean &quot;minecart chests&quot; or just plain chests?

I forgot, what about beds or dispencers.

(Can I have multiple bed&#39;s. or does only the last work?)
[/QUOTE]

Yes I did mean minecart chests,sorry.If you sleep in one bed,and then sleep in another,you will spawn at the second bed you slept in - and if the second bed was destroyed and you died you would respawn at spawn.You can set xrays to detect pretty much anything,although some people might not have theirs set to detect hidden dispensers and they might just ignore them.</span>
