Inacio, me, and a few other people had a base at around 100k blocks from spawn for 6+ months, that no one found.  Until we decided to give out the coords and kill ourselves.

I think it would be nice if there was just ruins at spawn, but nothing like a giant walled in spawn. When I started playing the spawn was all bombed looking  but there was still structures amid st the destruction, the spawn was i think surrounded by a wall, but you could easily get out. Seeing those structures made the server feel like what it was supposed to be, a pvp no rules server. People just living right at spawn and then getting demolished, I don&#39;t know what spawn looks like at the moment but If I was a new player and was stuck in spawn surrounded by giant stone mountains with lava pouring down them, idk it would be a neat sight but I would rather see destroyed buildings and castles at spawn like the old days."

1) Walk the nether roof
2) Put a portal on top of nether roof
3) Set up a base in overworld, put down a bed and sleep in it to set my spawn point
4) Get a diamond pick
5) Walk back through the portal
5) End up in a nether portal that is [b]under[/b] the roof
6) Glitch my way on top of the roof
7) Mine the top portal
8) Die, respawn in the overworld
9) Get another diamond pick
10) Go through portal, exit at bottom nether portal.
11) Go under the place I died, and wait 2 minutes for items to despawn
12) Go to the place where I glitched to the top of the roof and remove all signs of my activity
13) Mine the bottom nether portal
14) jump into lava

What&#39;s the point of playing multiplayer if you are never going to see another player?[/QUOTE]

I&#39;ll reply with something that I posted a couple pages back:

[QUOTE=FunnyBunny;37183984]I am one of &#39;those&#39; players that are a significant distance out from spawn. Not as far as 100k, but a significant amount. While it is true that it&#39;s basically single player, I do it for two reasons:

1. If I ever get bored of just building, I can travel back to spawn and steal some supplies for some free stuff/building materials.
2. I build structures above ground. Although it is safer in single player, no one gets to appreciate your work. The best thing about 2b2t is knowing that eventually, yes, I&#39;m going to get bored of playing on this server. But when that happens, eventually somebody will stumble on what I&#39;ve built and appreciate it. As opposed to single player, where once I get bored with a server it&#39;s gone forever. Imagine if more people played &#39;singleplayer&#39; while logged into 2b2t. There would be so much more ruins to explore.[/QUOTE]

Although 1.5 Mil is kinda overkill. I&#39;m within 50k of spawn and we have a massive above ground castle and it hasn&#39;t been discovered for several months now. I we also have some lone bedrock-level base &lt;10k from spawn which has been undiscovered for ~14 months now. The trick to surviving is to not be a dumbass with the nether.

Rule 1. Never leave evidence in the nether. Nether gates are a big no no. Cobblestone and dirt paths over lava lakes are a runner up. 
Rule 2. Never build on a lone axis. You could go 5 mil out, it still wouldn&#39;t save you if your coords are (x = 5,000,000 z = 0).

By not being a dumbass it&#39;s perfectly feasible to have an above ground base &lt; 20k from spawn go undiscovered for months."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Nikita;37484417]So after setting up a base at 1.5 million, where nobody could find me, I realized something.

What&#39;s the point of playing multiplayer if you are never going to see another player?[/QUOTE]

I&#39;ll reply with something that I posted a couple pages back:

[QUOTE=FunnyBunny;37183984]I am one of &#39;those&#39; players that are a significant distance out from spawn. Not as far as 100k, but a significant amount. While it is true that it&#39;s basically single player, I do it for two reasons:

1. If I ever get bored of just building, I can travel back to spawn and steal some supplies for some free stuff/building materials.
2. I build structures above ground. Although it is safer in single player, no one gets to appreciate your work. The best thing about 2b2t is knowing that eventually, yes, I&#39;m going to get bored of playing on this server. But when that happens, eventually somebody will stumble on what I&#39;ve built and appreciate it. As opposed to single player, where once I get bored with a server it&#39;s gone forever. Imagine if more people played &#39;singleplayer&#39; while logged into 2b2t. There would be so much more ruins to explore.[/QUOTE]

Although 1.5 Mil is kinda overkill. I&#39;m within 50k of spawn and we have a massive above ground castle and it hasn&#39;t been discovered for several months now. I we also have some lone bedrock-level base &lt;10k from spawn which has been undiscovered for ~14 months now. The trick to surviving is to not be a dumbass with the nether.

Rule 1. Never leave evidence in the nether. Nether gates are a big no no. Cobblestone and dirt paths over lava lakes are a runner up. 
Rule 2. Never build on a lone axis. You could go 5 mil out, it still wouldn&#39;t save you if your coords are (x = 5,000,000 z = 0).

By not being a dumbass it&#39;s perfectly feasible to have an above ground base &lt; 20k from spawn go undiscovered for months.</span>

Eat zed flesh, spider eyes, don&#39;t sprint/jump or break unessecary blocks. 
Don&#39;t bother fighting other players, if they hit you, keep walking, unless you get a chance to knock them off a cliff or such. 
Try to get string from spiders, hole up at night inside of a dirt box/ tard pillar, find all burning mobs at dawn and collect the drops. 
Good luck
Also, try heading in an x+,z- direction"

Don&#39;t bother fighting other players, if they hit you, keep walking, unless you get a chance to knock them off a cliff or such. 
Try to get string from spiders, hole up at night inside of a dirt box/ tard pillar, find all burning mobs at dawn and collect the drops. 
Good luck
Also, try heading in an x+,z- direction[/QUOTE]
 
yeah i managed to eat zombie flesh once, but the lag is a pain in the ass.</span>
