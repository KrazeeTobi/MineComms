Birch saplings all stay relatively the same size. They&#39;ll never become large branched trees, which are harder to chop down, and so birch is more efficient.</span>

Bare minimum: Saplings (any kind), seeds, sufficient coal/charcoal to light up the bitch in case you can&#39;t find any while digging it out for what-ever reason, a bucket or two of water, and a bed.
Suggested: Above plus eggs, sugar cane, cactus, pumpkin(s), melon seeds, mushrooms, easy access to bones (skeleton spawners obviously a HUGE plus here). Could also have grass blocks (from silk touch or growing them down from the surface), but generally you should be able to build up a sufficient wheat farm to not have to worry about spawning animals.

Pros: 
- Birch saplings never grow into ridiculously gigantic trees (like oak will) and will always be 1x1 trunk with height of 4-8? blocks
- They &quot;tend to grow faster than oak trees&quot;
- They look good?

Cons:
- Birch saplings need to spaced out by 2 blocks from other birch saplings (and 4 blocks from other sapling types) in order to grow (less dense farming than oak)

Dear god please, if you&#39;re using a HD texture pack atleast get some mipmapping (optifine).

Ever since i started using it i can&#39;t stand looking at pictures without it."

What are you talking about, dunno if it was &quot;fixed&quot; or not but time and time again when I respawn in 2b2t I fall to far then the chunks regenerate I teleport to the top but the fall damage still happens and I die and the text says &quot;UberMesh suicided&quot; As if I actually fell 500 blocks. thats why I did it

and do you think this is really my fault?

I guess if you had a past experience you would attempt to be cautious... hence the desire to save your respawn point.  But now you know!

Though if it&#39;s helpful to know, I logged in on 2b2t whilst the DDoS or some ridiculous lag was going on, and I managed to fall to -3k y before it finally loaded a single chunk where I was standing...

And nothing happened.  It made a cracking bones noise and I did not take any damage.

Seems that perhaps there was a change made, and instead of the falling and resulting death being calculated client-side, your client now renders you as falling through the world, but once the server actually says &quot;Excuse me here is your chunk you requested.  You are not falling, and you are definitely alive still.&quot; the client will just update to that information.

For the same reason could be why you can sometimes see many mobs around you all fall into the world but &quot;teleport&quot; back to their original positions once the chunks are loaded.  And why you hear a &quot;damage sound&quot; when you do fall for a bit before chunks load, but don&#39;t actually take damage.

It&#39;s speculation as to any changes in coding since I haven&#39;t decompiled any Minecraft source, but since I&#39;ve played on 2b2t, I&#39;ve never actually died from &quot;lag-induced chunk-lacking&quot; during a log in. :)"
