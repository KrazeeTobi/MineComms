Yesterday I walked out of spawn to 1200,-1500 before I needed food. On the way I found 4 pieces of zombie flesh floating on the ground and ate them. By the time I got there I had found 4 chests in the open and two of them had melon in them. At about 1500.-1900 I found a giant base loaded with food and stacks of iron and armor. I equipped myself and kept walking. 

Entire time spent on this effort was about 20 minutes. It&#39;s not difficult.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=.Isak.;36951403]I&#39;ll try to give it a few more tries, but it&#39;s too different for my tastes. I managed to stockpile lots of chicken and zombie flesh, but it&#39;s still really difficult to find anything worthwhile. Even with zombe&#39;s.

Plus I still think the spawn is absolutely terrible. More than half the time it&#39;s full of lava. It should be a small, build-protected flat block where new players can leave without burning. The on-the-side-of-a-volcano shit is frustrating as all hell, since if you die you&#39;ll probably be stuck in lava dying repeatedly for another good 10-15 minutes until someone drops water.

I just miss the simpler times when flying wasn&#39;t blocked and 2b2t was essentially a competitive survival-build server. Where everyone had mob grinders and duplicators and all you really worried about was somebody finding you and bombing you to hell and back.[/QUOTE]

I guess you could try to do an archeology series or something, but you&#39;d have to record the entire thing in advance or people would work out where you were and come blow you up etc.</span>

So far every settlement/base/outpost that ive lived in have been led by someone else.
The first was a real Fag named urue_101, only reason i stuck with him was because he got me out of spawn and supplied me with gear. The base we lived at (8k from spawn) lasted 2 weeks. He was real hard ass with &#39;ALL RESOURCES MUST BE SHARED&#39; and he let no one other than the original 4 of us, join the group. (Totalitarian)

2 base i lived at (Divercity) Founded by Omalilymix was the opposite. He didnt give out the coords willy nilly. He was the opposite, almost everything was in the public chests but we were free to have our own supplies. Then one day he moved almost everything to hidden chests in mineshafts not too far, but didnt give coords. Yhen he started giving out coords, xcc2, faalbanana, and even poopboob visited.
Base was gone in about 3 months (socialist)

I&#39;ve learned my lesson. You need control, but you need freedom, you must give your residents/roomates control. All the diamonds are kept in public chests. We all use our own ger, minus things like silk touch picks and aqua affinity helets and such. But they are free to keep what they want, the best gear and loot, so long as they do not deprive the rest of us or use all of our materials(IE a full chest of wood) without replacing or at least partially restocking it, they can do what they want.

I may be the Governor of the Shroom, but this is a democracy.
The only thing i  has complete control over is who lives here. 
Only i have authority to divulge our location, which is the only thing that really matters. (Democracy)

I may be the Governor of the Shroom, but this is a democracy.
The only thing i  has complete control over is who lives here. 
Only i have authority to divulge our location, which is the only thing that really matters. (Democracy)

TL,DR Mix and match Govt types for best results[/QUOTE]

This is why the mushroom island is so nice to live on.
Now we just need about 2 more residents.</span>

Pretty much, if you&#39;re on top of where I built and you dig 1 block anywhere under you, you&#39;ll fall into this place.

This grassy area is just over 68 blocks length and 51 blocks width. Maximum height of 16 blocks.
