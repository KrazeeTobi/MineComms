I can&#39;t play much for the next 2 weeks, but lately, it&#39;s dead. Chrisingleghton is running out of people to troll. x0XP is running out of new players to kill and bases to torch. I feel less and less likely to have my home found and destroyed. 
If we do not take action to really revive 2b2t, this may very well be the end of our era. 
New players are less and less frequent, oldfags are still here, but people like me, middle players (6 months or less) are disappearing one by one. 
We need a surge in players and we need to give them a real experience. 
We need to take spawn, and make it 10 times as bad. We need to make this the true hell on earth server it is. lava left and right, a gigantic roof over spawn to keep mobs constantly spawning. Roving gangs of diamond clad assholes to hunt down and kill new players. 
I joined this server for a challenge it was, and people come here looking for a challenge. And you know what? The Romans were right.

 PM me the cords, I&#39;ll drop off like 4-5 stacks of reed if you want. I&#39;ll also bring 6 stacks of books. Also check your own PM&#39;s here.


im ready to travel to your base. Got like 6 stacks of blaze rods, two stacks of warts, 2 stacks of cane, 15 diamond blocks, 64 sticky pistons, seeds for melon pumpkin and 6 cocoa beans for when they grow in 1.3 as well as 20 jungle saps. If you want them. Just PM me the cords and I&#39;ll drop them off. I won&#39;t stay since I like my base too much."

im ready to travel to your base. Got like 6 stacks of blaze rods, two stacks of warts, 2 stacks of cane, 15 diamond blocks, 64 sticky pistons, seeds for melon pumpkin and 6 cocoa beans for when they grow in 1.3 as well as 20 jungle saps. If you want them. Just PM me the cords and I&#39;ll drop them off. I won&#39;t stay since I like my base too much.</span>
