It appears as if this town had undergone some serious griefing. What used to be full buildings were now rubble, only recognized by their incomplete walls and hanging ceilings.

I stand now, in the middle of these ruins and I give a moment of silence to a fallen city.

Reading the OP more thoroughly, I know now what town it was that I discovered. It&#39;s amazing how much I have found, and how little is left unharmed. It&#39;s truly a chaotic server.

It took me a long time to find any sort of food to survive let alone wood to build shelter. But I found this one town. It&#39;s huge. But clearly deserted. The most recent sign post is from May 12th. It appears as if this town had undergone some serious griefing. What used to be full buildings were now rubble, only recognized by their incomplete walls and hanging ceilings. Farms barely having enough food to provide for a single person, let alone the dozens of people I imagine it once cradled.

I stand now, in the middle of these ruins and I give a moment of silence to a fallen city.

EDIT:

Reading the OP more thoroughly, I know now what town it was that I discovered. It&#39;s amazing how much I have found, and how little is left unharmed. It&#39;s truly a chaotic server.

It appears as if this town had undergone some serious griefing. What used to be full buildings were now rubble, only recognized by their incomplete walls and hanging ceilings. Farms barely having enough food to provide for a single person, let alone the dozens of people I imagine it once cradled.

I stand now, in the middle of these ruins and I give a moment of silence to a fallen city.

EDIT:

Reading the OP more thoroughly, I know now what town it was that I discovered. It&#39;s amazing how much I have found, and how little is left unharmed. It&#39;s truly a chaotic server.
