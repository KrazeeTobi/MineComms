Dam. When I was first traveling to omal&#39;s base many months ago, I happened across a mushroom biome. I went full retard and didn&#39;t save the Coords. Is this in the X+ z- quadrent?

If I knew where the biome was, I&#39;d move there, it&#39;d be a nice break from living in the ruins of Divercity."

im turning my mushroom island into a fort and its going to be cool fucking beans[/QUOTE]
 
Dam. When I was first traveling to omal&#39;s base many months ago, I happened across a mushroom biome. I went full retard and didn&#39;t save the Coords. Is this in the X+ z- quadrent?

If I knew where the biome was, I&#39;d move there, it&#39;d be a nice break from living in the ruins of Divercity.</span>

Yeah, I crossed it as well but din&#39;t save the cords either. However the only thing good about those islands is the mushrooms and mooshrooms. if you want mycrilliam or whatever just go back to our griefed base area and collect some out of the sky. That&#39;s what I did, also you only need one piece since it spreads to barren dirt.

I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is the same island either, I know the general location of where to look however. but I hate boating and it&#39;s nearly all ocean out there. But any land mass would be easy to spot with Far render distance. Just make a grid to search and I could easily do it in half a day."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Flamereaper66;36544933]I made rounds on the base and cleared every chest. Got about 1.5 stacks of DB and a stack each of other valuables. Including about 20 grass and mycillium blocks. No other unobtainables though, because omal left me nothing. Any chance I can visit you?
I&#39;m hold up in a small facility I made on the outskirts of the base. When 1.3 comes out I will start enchanting, I don&#39;t want to have to do lvl 50 each time, in 1.3 it only goes to 30. As soon as I have some god tier armor I&#39;ll start going mobile. How have you been since the schism?[/QUOTE]
 
Haha.... No. :dance:  (Check your private messages)

Technically not a ban, but it is.

So much for no bans on 2b2t.

This is a misunderstanding, there have not been any IPs that have been blocked. It&#39;s due to the ipv6/dns change going on with Telia in Sweden. It will be fixed asap by them I suppose, but I can&#39;t do anything to fix it. Also I have no idea why you think Benjojo would have anything to do with it or why I would listen to him (and he hasn&#39;t even done anything for the server either, no plugins or anything)"
