Your reasoning is absurd.
If wiring is present, some people will be upset that they can&#39;t use it effectively.
If wiring is gone or simplified, they won&#39;t be upset that they still can&#39;t use it effectively?

It&#39;s like you people assume it&#39;s evil because some folks don&#39;t understand it.  Honestly, it&#39;s not that hard, tutorials [i]already exist[/i], more are coming.  If someone absolutely cannot figure out how to use it, they&#39;re a moron and we shouldn&#39;t worry about them.  If they don&#39;t want to...they won&#39;t.  No reason to complain, because it&#39;ll have the same effect on you whether it&#39;s present or not."

If wiring is present, some people will be upset that they can&#39;t use it effectively.
If wiring is gone or simplified, they won&#39;t be upset that they still can&#39;t use it effectively?

It&#39;s like you people assume it&#39;s evil because some folks don&#39;t understand it.  Honestly, it&#39;s not that hard, tutorials [i]already exist[/i], more are coming.  If someone absolutely cannot figure out how to use it, they&#39;re a moron and we shouldn&#39;t worry about them.  If they don&#39;t want to...they won&#39;t.  No reason to complain, because it&#39;ll have the same effect on you whether it&#39;s present or not.[/QUOTE]

So I go into a game of gmod. Wire, wire everywhere. I go to learn it. Its way to confusing for me, even reading straight off a sheet. I wanna be able to build epic constructions with friends, not turrets that auto kill everyone.

Same with minecraft. Its going to be filled with people in multiplayer discussing the newest logic gate. I wanna have minecraft simple, like it is now. Any further with this logic gate crap is shit."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Xenocidebot;23170876]Your reasoning is absurd.
If wiring is present, some people will be upset that they can&#39;t use it effectively.
If wiring is gone or simplified, they won&#39;t be upset that they still can&#39;t use it effectively?

It&#39;s like you people assume it&#39;s evil because some folks don&#39;t understand it.  Honestly, it&#39;s not that hard, tutorials [i]already exist[/i], more are coming.  If someone absolutely cannot figure out how to use it, they&#39;re a moron and we shouldn&#39;t worry about them.  If they don&#39;t want to...they won&#39;t.  No reason to complain, because it&#39;ll have the same effect on you whether it&#39;s present or not.[/QUOTE]

So I go into a game of gmod. Wire, wire everywhere. I go to learn it. Its way to confusing for me, even reading straight off a sheet. I wanna be able to build epic constructions with friends, not turrets that auto kill everyone.

Same with minecraft. Its going to be filled with people in multiplayer discussing the newest logic gate. I wanna have minecraft simple, like it is now. Any further with this logic gate crap is shit.</span>

You&#39;re still not making any sense.
&quot;I wanna be able to build epic stuff like everyone else, not simple stuff.&quot;
&quot;If I can&#39;t build epic stuff, I don&#39;t want anybody else to be able to either, and we should all be limited to simple stuff.&quot;
