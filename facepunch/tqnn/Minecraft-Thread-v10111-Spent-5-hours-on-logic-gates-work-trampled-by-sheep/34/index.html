I&#39;m going to ask yet again, Is this worty of buying? Don&#39;t just say yes. Elaborate.
It just seems like creative mode except you have to spend more time on it to get stuff to build with. Do you have to actually eat to not die, giving you a reason to hunt stuff? Can the creatures try to break your structures at night? That&#39;s what i thought atfirst, But watching some streams made it look like surviving during night time isn&#39;t hard at all. To me it all just seems like it&#39;s exactly like creative mode except you can get killed from a bunch of stuff, except for crafting with wich you can do some stuff.

Besides, You probably didn&#39;t read through the OP yourself. What kind of a person are you, Acting smart about something you don&#39;t know anything about? 


I&#39;m going to ask yet again, Is this worty of buying? Don&#39;t just say yes. Elaborate.
It just seems like creative mode except you have to spend more time on it to get stuff to build with. Do you have to actually eat to not die, giving you a reason to hunt stuff? Can the creatures try to break your structures at night? That&#39;s what i thought atfirst, But watching some streams made it look like surviving during night time isn&#39;t hard at all. To me it all just seems like it&#39;s exactly like creative mode except you can get killed from a bunch of stuff, except for crafting with wich you can do some stuff. To survive it seems to me that all you&#39;ve got to do is burry yourself in the ground. I think the red dust is very interesting though. I&#39;m surprised to see that many dumbasses in this thread whining about it, Seems to me like one of the best additions yet.[/QUOTE]

I would say it&#39;s definiatly worth it, there are a lot of possibilities in what you can build when it comes to survival, you may not have the creative freedom that you have in creative, but the things you build feels more earned when you have to work for the resources.

It&#39;s not only fun to just build however, and the possibility of creeps make it more fun, you can survive with just building yourself in, yes, but when you go and explore the large amount of caves that you are sure to find while being underground you have to either put it to peaceful, or man up, get an armour and a weapon and fight the beasts.

You are right with the redstone by the way, Notch implementing power into the game will open up the possibilites with what you can build and only that will make the game (in my opinion) atleast twice as good, it&#39;s always fun to build stuff but you want to create more intricate things.

The game is definiatly worth €10 or $15, I think I&#39;ve spent 50 hours in this game and the best have yet to come, which makes the game extremely costworthy when you consider that it&#39;s still in the alpha phase and not a finished game.

The possibilities are almost endless, and more possibilities are coming every week.

Buy it if you enjoy sandbox games, heck, buy it anyways, I can assure you that you will enjoy it.

[quote][B]Multiplayer progress update, and Minecraft Alpha 1.0.3[/B]

Getting the levels to support more than one player turned out to be a bigger rewrite than I thought. There was a surprising amount of level.getPlayer() calls, so I added a level.getNearestPlayer(x, y, z), which worked great as a substitute for most of the calls.
Another issue was the tile polling. In the original version, tiles between two players would get polled twice as frequently as tiles only near a single player. This also affected the mob spawner code. The solution there was to build a set of all unique chunks near players, which turns out to be handy when I do the memory caching of terrain data anyway.

I haven&amp;#8217;t actually implemented any multiplayer support in the client yet, but I did do some work on it, which leads up to version 1.0.3:

* The pathfinder now works for hills. Except for spiders. Of course.
* Generally more convincing mob idling behavior. They&amp;#8217;ll stand still more, looking around at their surroundings
* Monster sounds
* Ambient cave noises

Tomorrow is Thursday, then it&amp;#8217;s Seecret Friday time, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like I&amp;#8217;ll have anything testable this week.[/quote]"

                        <postrender input="Getting the levels to support more than one player turned out to be a bigger rewrite than I thought. There was a surprising amount of level.getPlayer() calls, so I added a level.getNearestPlayer(x, y, z), which worked great as a substitute for most of the calls.
Another issue was the tile polling. In the original version, tiles between two players would get polled twice as frequently as tiles only near a single player. This also affected the mob spawner code. The solution there was to build a set of all unique chunks near players, which turns out to be handy when I do the memory caching of terrain data anyway.

I haven’t actually implemented any multiplayer support in the client yet, but I did do some work on it, which leads up to version 1.0.3:

* The pathfinder now works for hills. Except for spiders. Of course.
* Generally more convincing mob idling behavior. They’ll stand still more, looking around at their surroundings
* Monster sounds
* Ambient cave noises

Tomorrow is Thursday, then it’s Seecret Friday time, so it doesn’t seem like I’ll have anything testable this week.
