Except that implies you own the entirety of or have to be playing Minecraft.  You don&#39;t.  It&#39;s optional for you.

A better analogy is coming over to someone&#39;s house, finding them drinking martinis, and bitching that they&#39;re not drinking beer, despite them offering you one.
Don&#39;t like martinis?  Drink the fucking beer.
Cannot stand them for drinking them?  [i]Leave.[/i]"

[quote=Notch]The rationale for Redstone
“But why”, some people ask, “are you making Minecraft programmable?”. The reason is, adventure mode!

The three main game modes when the game is finished will be:

* Creative mode. You can build anything for free, and there’s no health bar, and no inventory.
* Survival mode. There’s a health bar, an inventory, and you need to gather resources to be able to build.
* Adventure mode. There’s a health bar and an inventory, but you can’t destroy or place blocks, you can only use items.

(You can combine at least the two latter game modes for different players in multiplayer)

I foresee a future where people can design “challenge maps” in creative or survival mode, then share them with people so that they can try to beat them in Adventure mode. Being able to create interesting puzzles or trigger events requires some more advanced programming than the sand and water based stuff we’ve seen so far, yet still I don’t want to introduce real programming into the world.
I think the Redstone Dust (which is, and always has been[*] the official name for the red stuff) fits fairly well with the pseudo fantasy theme of Minecraft, and it will certainly have more uses in the future, mainly for alchemy and possibly other forms of magic.

Also, I’m a huge cellular automata nerd.

What the fuck, now you&#39;re going on about payment?

Why are you so angered against any sort of wiring? It&#39;s just remote right-clicking. You can&#39;t make things as complex as automated turrets and facing things and all the stupid inane bullshit that wire users tend to make daily, it&#39;s a fucking wire and a torch. Who gives a shit what people do with it? It&#39;ll never be as complex as Garry&#39;s Mod unless Notch allows it to become that way.

Besides, once modding comes to pass Minecraft, this would have inevitably happened anyway.

I don&#39;t even use wire or cuprite that often, even though I can use it to it&#39;s full potential. But you&#39;re just being an intense bitch about all this."

What the fuck, now you&#39;re going on about payment?

Why are you so angered against any sort of wiring? It&#39;s just remote right-clicking. You can&#39;t make things as complex as automated turrets and facing things and all the stupid inane bullshit that wire users tend to make daily, it&#39;s a fucking wire and a torch. Who gives a shit what people do with it? It&#39;ll never be as complex as Garry&#39;s Mod unless Notch allows it to become that way.

Besides, once modding comes to pass Minecraft, this would have inevitably happened anyway.

I don&#39;t even use wire or cuprite that often, even though I can use it to it&#39;s full potential. But you&#39;re just being an intense bitch about all this.</span>

No you fucking nimrod, it&#39;s like paying to enter a bar, sitting down to eat something that you love, and then seeing someone at the table next to you eating a dish you&#39;re not fond of.

You then proceed to stand up, flipping the chair backwards while flailing your arms around and screaming at the top of your lungs how this man should be prohibited from ever entering your bar again, and that the food he has paid for should be taken away from him because that&#39;s not something you like."
