[quote]A fully explored minecraft map would take up somewhere between 100 and 200 petabytes. That’s 100,000-200,000 full 1TB disk drives.

So, yes, I overstated a bit when I said there wasn’t enough hard drive space in Europe. :)[/quote]

I believe he means he said there was enough hard drive space in Europe on FAP, but above that is what it really should take.

So yeah, I mis-said it earlier, but I meant this."

Sure, I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, I just thought he would have been a bit smarter about it.

Me and my friend was discussing it. Assuming he&#39;s using algorithms to generate the world, he could store the values it used and keep them for later. Record all the last block changes the player made and just store that. So you generate the terrain again using them values and then make the changes the player made. As long as the player didn&#39;t change a few million blocks, the file size would be pretty small.

So instead of the file size being bound on the places you discovered, it would just be bound on player changes, which would be a huge difference."

Sure, I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, I just thought he would have been a bit smarter about it.

Me and my friend was discussing it. Assuming he&#39;s using algorithms to generate the world, he could store the values it used and keep them for later. Record all the last block changes the player made and just store that. So you generate the terrain again using them values and then make the changes the player made. As long as the player didn&#39;t change a few million blocks, the file size would be pretty small.

So instead of the file size being bound on the places you discovered, it would just be bound on player changes, which would be a huge difference.</span>

This is a good idea and should be emailed to him.

An infdev world  that was hardly explored was about 3.98mb. I&#39;m dreading to think how big infdev maps will be when 20-30 people are on them all doing their own thing, plus the 5 or so griefers who just walk one way for ever. I don&#39;t fancy downloading 100mb maps."

I had to reformat my hard drive and remove my second drive because it broke and it was the one with operating system installed on it, I thought the Infdev files save to server but I was wrong, everything is gone now. I might find a new hill maybe and build a new kingdom.

I lost all of my precious files I had on my PC, graphic work, mod work, just everything, including all the different photos from parties or my hobby photos I took over a long period of time.

You could backup with Wuala. It  works great if you only do a few folders, but it&#39;s nothing I&#39;d backup a whole system with.</span>

Me and my friend was discussing it. Assuming he&#39;s using algorithms to generate the world, he could store the values it used and keep them for later. Record all the last block changes the player made and just store that. So you generate the terrain again using them values and then make the changes the player made. As long as the player didn&#39;t change a few million blocks, the file size would be pretty small.

So instead of the file size being bound on the places you discovered, it would just be bound on player changes, which would be a huge difference.[/QUOTE]
