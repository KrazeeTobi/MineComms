2b2t old images recovered from old facepunch threads. All compilated in 2 albums.

This is just the first set. 260 images. First set have 150. Some of the images have description, some do not. Actually some doesn&#39;t really need one.

Wait what&#39;s even going on?

Edit: 

Turns out he spent a while dissing me in chat for &#39;going round telling people&#39; I base with him.
Wish he would have spoken to me about this gripe as its not true.

The only time I remember staying at the same base as him was Gape 1.0 for all of 2 hours."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=silentpedro;46844138]A little over a year ago, I was hunting a newfriend at spawn. As I was about to make the killing blow, I was shot by Taylo and sent falling to my doom. I did not forget this incident.

I come to you today with the exact coordinates of Taylo&#39;s base with one of the last working end portals. 

I am not normally one to leak coordinates like this, but after Taylo returned and insulted community leader and friend James_Rustles, I knew the time had come.

I have left the base intact. It includes the end portal, pig spawners, and other interesting sights. I will let fate decide what happens to this place.

Why is leaking the coords of a base where almost everything at that base has been spawned, cancer?
Forgot to mention in previous posts that taylo also had backdoor access, along with iTristan, Pyrobyte, popbob and ImperatorTerrae, hence my knowledge.

However, the base is old, and was sort of public knowledge anyway. It&#39;s in my coordinates list for a start.
Simply because, it&#39;s Kaamtown."

Why is leaking the coords of a base where almost everything at that base has been spawned, cancer?
Forgot to mention in previous posts that taylo also had backdoor access, along with iTristan, Pyrobyte, popbob and ImperatorTerrae, hence my knowledge.

However, the base is old, and was sort of public knowledge anyway. It&#39;s in my coordinates list for a start.
Simply because, it&#39;s Kaamtown.</span>

[B][U]Top 10 Most Hated Players on 2b2t[/U] [/B]

1 – [B]popbob[/B]
Why: 2b2t true master of deception and autism. Popbob is main suspect of sabotage on couple facepunch bases. He also backdoored the server, making hause install a plugin he made. And also known for spamming during his catfight with chrisleighton.

2 – [B]luke2thebun[/B] 
Why: Luke is literally the most hated griefer of 2b2t. He destroyed countless bases, most of them facepunch republics.

3 – [B]sequel[/B] (Not sure the complete nickname)
Why: Sequel is just behind luke. He also erased many facepunch bases, stalking them, on both game and fp forum. He is known for leaving irritating and edgy signs on the places he grief.

4 – [B]BennyGun[/B]
Why: Another griefer of 2b2t. Also a stalker of facepunch bases, BennyGun harassed many fp players through whisper spamming as well and got banned from facepunch at least more than 3 times.

5 – [B]jared2013[/B]
Why: Jared have a natural talent to attract hate. Probably the only one on this list that didn’t achieve anything great, he is still hated by the majority of 2b2t players currently most due his faggotry on 2b2t chat and his tryhard trollings 

6 – [B]drewbookman[/B]
Why: Edgy on 2b2t chat and also the griefer of Valkyria. Drew also griefed Valkyria a second time, however maybe not all of it.

7 – [B]Hausemaster[/B]
Why: The admin of the server, Hause is a mixture of love and hate. Sometimes you love him, sometimes you hate him. But most of times you hate him. All due server issues and his negligence to fix them.

8 – [B]Chrisleighton[/B]
Why: Chris was one of the most irritating players of 2b2t history. The best spammer of 2b2t, he basically brainwashed players with his motto “I am the king of 2b2t” repeating it on chat over and over and over. Day after day. That made him actually earn this title. He also poured lava on 2b2t spawn during a time, making new players unable to play the server.

9 –  [B]x0XP[/B]
Why: Known for griefing 1mil town, stalking Judge groups during the 1mil exploration. He is also accused of griefing other bases and won even more fame because of 2b2t comic, highlighting him as a villain in both new and old chapters. 

10 – [B]Harblax[/B]
Why: Someone who abused during popbob plugin, flooding the nether and causing other problems, such as the destruction of some bases. 


[B][U]Top 10 Players that made 2b2t a better place[/U][/B]

1 – [B]xcc2[/B]
Why: Creator of some of the most iconic buildings and bases of 2b2t, xcc2 is probably the best builder that the server had. He repaired and maintained bases along the server history, being NFE the most fixed.  He is legit loved and respected by everyone for his creations.

2 – [B]Chezhead[/B]
Why: The president of the facepunchers on 2b2t. He triggered and organized the facepunchers on 2b2t the best way he could. Giving each players a duty/job and maintaining bases and keeping control of tons of new players that joined him and his republic each day. His attempt to create order on 2b2t is admirable. 

3 – [B]THEJudgeHolden[/B]
Why: Probably one of the few 2b2t artists. Judge made a comic, highlighting himself and his adventures on the server. The people he met. The bases he lived on. The events he faced. He compiled all his experience in those pages, making a true odyssey. This was also important for new players to understand what they could possibly face as well as a history record of some important events on 2b2t.

4 – [B]Kinorana[/B]
Why: The blacksmith of 2b2t, kinorana changed the server by duping his tools and bows, spreading them through valkyria and its members, causing them to spread around the server as well. His effort to create only the best tools and weapons and the generosity he had by sharing this amazing items changed the server balance forever, making newfags and middlefags to stay on the same power level as oldfags, on both resource and pvp.

5 – [B]passie05[/B]
Why: Another great builder of 2b2t. Passie is xcc2 rival on building skills, even though together they built amazing things. 

6 – [B]Pyrobyte[/B]
Why: Pyrobyte was vital during Valkyria 1.0 and 2.0, duping and sharing during the 1.4.7 dupe. He also made 3b3t server, because of 2b2t lag problems, giving players a second home. His open source hacked client is also another great contribution to the server.

7 – [B]Assassin_raptor[/B]
Why: A known facepuncher, creator of many of his outposts, raptor attempted to keep the fp fire burning when the decline started, making around 4 or more outposts for the people on the thread and facing the agony of seeing each of them being sabotaged over and over. 

8 – [B]Sato86[/B]
Why: Sato created a base filled with players when no one believed this could still be possible since facepunch republic time, proving that 2b2t was not dead yet and that it still had much to offer. Valkyria is 2b2t most populated base, having the sum of 40 unique players that lived and worked there on cooperation. He also attempted to create similar base projects, such as Asgard and Fenrir.

9 – [B]Coldwave[/B]
Why: Coldwave played the most important role on Valkyria, calling out his crew and friends irl to populate the base. At 8 members of Valk were his friends irl. This allowed the base to have more connections to other players in the server.

10 – [B]Policemike55[/B]
Why: Another Facepuncher, Mike created many bases for his friends and fellow facepunchers, suffering the same constant raids and sabotage as raptor and chezhead did, but in less number, since he made less bases.

Well, the new backdoor is  recent, I started this list like 1 month ago. And it didnt affect the server as much as the first one.
Probably the only who hate him because of the backdoor are those who got left out. Other than that, he is not that hated.

[QUOTE=x0XP;46849911]Mike also had a love/hate thing going on, being practically bestfriends with popbob on 2b2t around his peak times, he was equally hated as he was liked.[/QUOTE]
 
I know. But I only took in consideration the good stuff he did. He really tried hard to settle a lot of facepunch bases and help people in the beginning. Mike faced a lot of troubles by doing this also."

Will do.

[QUOTE=x0XP;46849911]Also if popbob is on the hated list for a backdoor, shouldn&#39;t Pyrobyte, iTristan and ImperatorTerrae be on this list too? The only difference is one case is more known than the other.[/QUOTE]
 
Well, the new backdoor is  recent, I started this list like 1 month ago. And it didnt affect the server as much as the first one.
Probably the only who hate him because of the backdoor are those who got left out. Other than that, he is not that hated.

[QUOTE=x0XP;46849911]Mike also had a love/hate thing going on, being practically bestfriends with popbob on 2b2t around his peak times, he was equally hated as he was liked.[/QUOTE]
 
I know. But I only took in consideration the good stuff he did. He really tried hard to settle a lot of facepunch bases and help people in the beginning. Mike faced a lot of troubles by doing this also.</span>

Yes, we all know what sort of non-damage you&#39;re doing by directly undermining 2b2t itself.

And another thing, their plugins are still on 2b2t, but with the backdoor removed, however with less lag than when the backdoor was their as they were uploading to one of Pyrobyte&#39;s websites 24/7, draining resources.[/QUOTE]

I dont have access to all information. Its true that items were spawned, but I never heard of he spawning items for other people than himself. If jared got his hand on a block with enchant, it was not through Pyro. He hates jared. Also, 2b2t was hitting today 8 tps to 14 tps. I really don&#39;t see any difference at all. His plugin might have made things a little worse, but its sure not the main cause. 
I am not foolproof, senpai, but I tried my best to compile this list. 

Its natural that I commit mistakes, but from what I observe, Pyro is not hated on the server. He didn&#39;t made any major griefing or spamming.

[QUOTE=x0XP;46850300]Pretty sure popbob never spawned a Sharpness 666 sword, they also collected more base coordinates than popbob did. Seems to me that it&#39;s actually effected 2b2t in a much worse way really. 

If I&#39;m wrong, in what way did popbob&#39;s plugin have more of a change on 2b2t?
And finally, popbob&#39;s plugin wasn&#39;t the first on 2b2t, I apologize for this, but get your facts correct first please Sato.

They spammed in chat over a year ago that they had a backdoor, so it was already revealed before you started this list.
I never pinned all blame on Pyrobyte, Tristan was the one who let others have items.
