Oh, they informed me about the backdoor. But I didn&#39;t take part of it, for three reasons:

1- I didn&#39;t ask to be part of it. During this time I was not playing much if I remember.
2- I have no coding knowledge nor tools to be part of it.
3- I don&#39;t feel I need a backdoor to play a blocky game. Specially when I already have everything and the game itself gives me ways to get everything I need. Again.

The backdoor was mainly used to get spawned items. And this items are still hidden somewhere and only they know where. From what I was informed, there is 0,001% chance of people to found it. So yeah, it almost didn&#39;t affect the server at all (at least not yet). 666 sword was probably the only moment and Pyro was just testing it.

Now, if a new dupe comes, 2 things can happen

1- This items are leaked (death, afking, stealing, falling, etc) and 2b2t pvp will change forever
2- This items are not leaked and some people will become gods

Its gonna make stacked god armor and inf potions looks like a joke. And I am not saying that&#39;s a good thing. To be sincere its a time-bomb, carefully set to explode on a near future. Some people will feel the blast more than others, if you know what I mean."

uh oh! kaamtown gets leaked one again! this is important news guys! no one ever knew about this base or it&#39;s coordinates before right?
Also, as you might have noticed, mcbrainbomb and javazon already trashed the base a long time ago.

You might also want to credit the many people that stayed at that base and put effort into it. All taylo built was a sitxth of an unfinished church filled with my spawners."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=silentpedro;46844138]A little over a year ago, I was hunting a newfriend at spawn. As I was about to make the killing blow, I was shot by Taylo and sent falling to my doom. I did not forget this incident.

I come to you today with the exact coordinates of Taylo&#39;s base with one of the last working end portals. 

-snip-[/QUOTE]
 
uh oh! kaamtown gets leaked one again! this is important news guys! no one ever knew about this base or it&#39;s coordinates before right?
Also, as you might have noticed, mcbrainbomb and javazon already trashed the base a long time ago.

You might also want to credit the many people that stayed at that base and put effort into it. All taylo built was a sitxth of an unfinished church filled with my spawners.</span>

With the old spawn portal, literally any newfriend could walk into the end on their first day on the server. It was far more open and far more accessible. 

Almost none of the existing end portals had coordinates readily available to the public. Your claim of &quot;many people knew&quot; is pretty much just a handful of oldfags. HerMuffin and Tuna confirmed that less than 10 people actually know of working portals.

Let&#39;s get to the real issue at hand. You are most likely upset that my leaks have received more positive feedback than yours."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=x0XP;46854783]There&#39;s multiple end portals scattered around 2b2t that&#39;re known about by a lot of people anyway. The end was never &quot;closed&quot;, it was always open. There should be another portal or two near spawn, there&#39;s one around -27k -6/7k (i think they were one of my old stash coords, could be wrong. There was one at -50k 200/-200, not sure if it was destroyed or not. And the largest stash of mine leaked by me like 2/3 years ago had a portal there if anyone still has the coordinates, the portal there was never removed.[/QUOTE]

With the old spawn portal, literally any newfriend could walk into the end on their first day on the server. It was far more open and far more accessible. 

Almost none of the existing end portals had coordinates readily available to the public. Your claim of &quot;many people knew&quot; is pretty much just a handful of oldfags. HerMuffin and Tuna confirmed that less than 10 people actually know of working portals.

Let&#39;s get to the real issue at hand. You are most likely upset that my leaks have received more positive feedback than yours.</span>
