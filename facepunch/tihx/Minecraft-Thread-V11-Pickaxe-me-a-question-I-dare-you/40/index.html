There&#39;s a difference between Gmod and Infdev, though. Gmod is and always was an open sandbox to use the Source Engine&#39;s assets to do whatever you want with (namely build). It&#39;s basically Minecraft&#39;s Creative mode.

Infdev, however, is and always was a survival game with limitations and goals that can be set. You don&#39;t start off with infinity of every block and you have to use tools and planning to build and survive against the infinite world&#39;s dangers. What is there to do once you&#39;re there with friends? It&#39;s fun to set goals and work together to build a thriving community in the midst of the mode&#39;s restrictions and the world&#39;s features. What do people even do right now in single player mode? They build towers and cities and castles. What are people going to do in multiplayer mode?

I agree, let&#39;s not jump the gun here and take designs off of other things like Oblivion. What works elsewhere may not work in Minecraft, where the world is made out of boxes.

I think the layout should be left up to everyone else once we get there, too. It&#39;s enough to design the main castle/building (if we&#39;re even going to have one). The people who are actually going to use the rest of the city should be able to set it up to their liking. Like I and others have said, a &quot;government-imposed&quot; system is stupid. Let people do what they want. The only job any &quot;leaders&quot; would have is to make sure it&#39;s organized and fits together."

I agree, let&#39;s not jump the gun here and take designs off of other things like Oblivion. What works elsewhere may not work in Minecraft, where the world is made out of boxes.

I think the layout should be left up to everyone else once we get there, too. It&#39;s enough to design the main castle/building (if we&#39;re even going to have one). The people who are actually going to use the rest of the city should be able to set it up to their liking. Like I and others have said, a &quot;government-imposed&quot; system is stupid. Let people do what they want. The only job any &quot;leaders&quot; would have is to make sure it&#39;s organized and fits together.</span>

I agree with you. But I do love the spoke wheel patter of ancient cities. But a lerge square one would fit minecraft best. Like I said that was the only city I knew and could easily convert it to a simple explanation of what I was thinking."

This. Just let people build what they want. The city should build its walls around what the people build, not as a boundary to show people where they can build.

Well yeah, it&#39;s up to the player. If someone wants to pick one job and do that job while relying on others for other kinds of supplies, then so be it. Certainly they&#39;ll probably switch jobs many times as well. And if someone wants to do everything a Minecrafter does and be self-sufficient, then so be it.

I think some of you are confusing this whole &quot;organized server&quot; thing as a restrictive RPG with rules. It&#39;s not. I&#39;m just saying that if some people want to take up specific jobs and help each other out by playing multiple parts of a whole Minecrafter&#39;s work, then we can help them keep it organized and orderly.

Many people won&#39;t need or want other people&#39;s help and will just go off and do their own thing. But then again if you&#39;re going to do that then why not just play single player? The reason we&#39;re all getting together and picking jobs and leaders is so that we can make multiplayer life more interesting as opposed to &quot;this is my area; stay out of my area and go over there&quot;.

And besides that, some people like certain elements of Minecraft more than other elements. I&#39;m not very artistic when it comes to building, but I love farming and I love looking at other people&#39;s work. I wouldn&#39;t mind one bit just farming food and giving it to the people who like to just build. That way they don&#39;t have to bother with gathering food and can just keep on building. Same with miners; maybe some people like to just mine and dig out intricate and resourceful caves. They&#39;ll gather materials for the builders so the builders don&#39;t have to themselves. That&#39;s three different groups of people working together to get stuff built, and in the end we all can sit back and take a look at the final products of our work. That&#39;s not to say the farmer can&#39;t take up a pickaxe every now and then, but if the farmer wants to just farm and not worry about expanding the buildings or collecting ore, then why not join forces with other people? Isn&#39;t that what multiplayer survival is all about?"

What&#39;s the point of anything in this game? What are we even working for? Why do we build assfuck huge towers with intricate designs when we&#39;re perfectly able to &quot;functionally&quot; survive in a small, enclosed box? There&#39;s no point to this game unless you give it your own point, otherwise the functionality boils down to &quot;survival&quot;, which can be achieved by spawning, picking up nine blocks of dirt around you, and covering yourself with it. Bam. You win! Might as well stop playing Minecraft.

It&#39;s fun to build ultimately useless things just for looks. Chairs are only there to accentuate that and allow us to give some neat little touches to our buildings. My bet is that almost all furniture will be functionally useless; it&#39;ll just serve to make our palaces and cabins look better and will be fun to arrange.

It&#39;s like having chairs and tables in Lego. We don&#39;t NEED chairs and tables and steering wheels and wheels and etc. etc. to build Lego creations. They&#39;re just fun to put there as props for our little Lego people to &quot;use&quot;."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Sasasing;22436589]So Notch is going to add chairs ingame, OH WOW I can&#39;t wait to sit and stare at those creepers mind blowed by the vision of my sweet fucking chair! How more exciting can it get, motherfucking chairs holy shit and they will do absolutely fucking nothing!

I&#39;m fine with Notch adding chairs, and it&#39;s a first step for adding other kinds of furniture which may be more useful than a chair, because honestly what&#39;s the purpose of a chair other than sitting in it? and what&#39;s so interesting in sitting in a chair? Could be great once MP makes it way but for now honestly it&#39;s not that &quot;holy shit chairs!&quot;. Signs and ladders are much more interesting, and I hope Notch adds more furniture which hopefuly will have some purpose or atleast it will look nice.[/QUOTE]

What&#39;s the point of anything in this game? What are we even working for? Why do we build assfuck huge towers with intricate designs when we&#39;re perfectly able to &quot;functionally&quot; survive in a small, enclosed box? There&#39;s no point to this game unless you give it your own point, otherwise the functionality boils down to &quot;survival&quot;, which can be achieved by spawning, picking up nine blocks of dirt around you, and covering yourself with it. Bam. You win! Might as well stop playing Minecraft.

It&#39;s fun to build ultimately useless things just for looks. Chairs are only there to accentuate that and allow us to give some neat little touches to our buildings. My bet is that almost all furniture will be functionally useless; it&#39;ll just serve to make our palaces and cabins look better and will be fun to arrange.

It&#39;s like having chairs and tables in Lego. We don&#39;t NEED chairs and tables and steering wheels and wheels and etc. etc. to build Lego creations. They&#39;re just fun to put there as props for our little Lego people to &quot;use&quot;.</span>

                            <span v-pre>If someone&#39;s feeling kind on Facepunch, they should make a Facepunch MP server when it comes out, passworded for all our enjoyment.

But please, PLEASE ACTUALLY moderate the server, don&#39;t just sit around and wait for the person griefing to make themselves really really obvious before banning them.

And I mean by all this, if you see someone deleting shit that&#39;s not theirs, kick them right away. If they come back saying they didn&#39;t know/it was theirs, give them one other chance. As soon as they do it again, Perma ban them, no questions asked.</span>

That&#39;s not going to be fun, though. You&#39;d literally be standing in a shop waiting for people to come in and trade with you.
Anyway, in terms of planning a city, it&#39;s best to look at what actual city planners do. Take Hausmann, for example - he built the roads, and then set up regulations about what the buildings could look like. So the first people on the map would decide how the roads will go (I&#39;m imagining a grid like structure because diagonals would require a lot of effort) and then there would be regulations on style (e.g. All buildings must be made of cobblestone, all windows must be two blocks by two blocks etc. etc.) and safety (e.g. all buildings must be illuminated by torches to prevent monster spawns inside). I think it might also be an idea to have some parks in which to plant saplings just so crafting a chest doesn&#39;t require an arduous journey to the few remaining trees in the area.
As for roads - maybe instead of having non functional road markings, you could divide up the middle with torches? That would go a long way to preventing mobs spawning in the city.
As a side note, I don&#39;t think griefers should be that heavily frowned upon. Ok, if you go around deleting blocks that&#39;s not on, but if someone &quot;accidentally&quot; leaves the city gates open/opens a mine below the city wall and there&#39;s an invasion of mobs, it wouldn&#39;t be so bad - it would be kind of fun! Heck, there could even be a couple of little towns with skirmishes between the two. And terrorists, bombing places with TNT!
Oh, I&#39;m getting carried away. I can&#39;t even run infdev on my computer (it finishes generating chunks up to like 99% and then java just crashes, meaning next time it&#39;s run there&#39;s a map with a size of 0.0MB) and indev lags me out (and sometimes chunks end up transparent - the blocks are there but I can&#39;t see them and while I can mine through them, they never become visible)"

When I mention &quot;trading&quot;, I mean a lot more than &quot;shop-owning&quot;. There&#39;s the fact that you have to gather the goods to be traded, set up pricing, and travel between places to trade with. I&#39;m highly doubtful any people will even do that, so all I&#39;m saying is that it would be interesting to actually see people put forth the effort to do that. I would; I love the idea of traveling between multiple towns peddling various goods. I&#39;m terrible at designing and building anyway. That&#39;s why I said I&#39;d like to be a farmer/trader. Besides that, a lot more people would participate in that kind of economy than just self-proclaimed traders. Basically anything you do in Minecraft is going to generate goods, be it mining or farming. Those people would be trading for other things too.

As for griefers, I seriously don&#39;t think any sort of allowance would work. Yeah, it would create more activities to do, but people would abuse it. Building stuff in Minecraft is hard work, and allowing people to blow holes in buildings doesn&#39;t sound very fun, especially since they could easily set off a ridiculous amount of TNT and devastate an entire town. What would be your reaction to that? &quot;Dohoho, you silly terrorists! Shoo while we rebuild,&quot; or &quot;Holy SHIT, I SPENT HOURS ON THAT. BAN.&quot; I&#39;d pick the latter, myself. :v:"

That&#39;s only valid if the OPs are flipping retarded. If I ever OP a server, I&#39;m not standing for any shit. You behave and respect others or you get out.

As for stealing, my hope is that Notch will at least implement player-bound chests. Basically meaning only the player who placed the chest can add or remove goods from it. The drop command is easy enough for giving goods to another person; there&#39;s no need to have people use chests for that. This would allow people to place their most valuable possessions in their own chest.

But I guess we&#39;ll see. Certainly in a mode where objects actually have value, Notch will at least go to some lengths to prevent griefing. And if he doesn&#39;t, then the community will."

But that&#39;s where the moral issue comes in. If you&#39;re an OP and you see someone go into a castle that isn&#39;t theirs, do you ban them for trying to steal or let them go on their way because they&#39;re just looking around?

If you ban them and they weren&#39;t planning to steal, you&#39;re a dick to the poor guy you banned for no reason.
If you don&#39;t ban them and they steal and get away with it, you&#39;re a dick to the person who owns the castle.
If you don&#39;t ban them and they were just looking around, you&#39;re not a dick to anyone and everything is fine.

There&#39;s a 2/3 chance that you&#39;ll fail at being an OP, which is more of a chance than I&#39;m willing to take in a situation like that.

Why be preemptive like that and ban people for walking into a building? Surely when the owner comes back, he&#39;ll notice that his shit is gone. That&#39;s when he reports it and investigation begins on finding the person who stole (i.e. who walked into there between x time and x time). Of course it&#39;s not always going to end in finding the criminal, but them&#39;s the breaks. You have to deal with those who you catch and move on if you can&#39;t catch them. Usually criminals are stupid anyway; they&#39;ll create a string of robberies and will be easier to catch. Most people are either griefers or they&#39;re not, and to maintain a working, community environment you have to give everyone the benefit of the doubt until they&#39;re caught. Should we have been banned for registering at FP on the premise that we could be coming to shitpost and troll?

As for &quot;classic&quot; greifers destroying buildings, you just have to deal with it like it&#39;s dealt with in Creative. If you catch a person doing it, they get a ban. Besides, it&#39;s a lot harder to destroy structures in infdev since it takes a few seconds to destroy each block. I don&#39;t think many people are going to go out of their way to create a strong pickaxe all just to go wreck someone else&#39;s house.

I wouldn&#39;t worry about infdev having a proliferation of grifers anyway, especially on private servers. Infdev, being harder to build in and more complicated with crafting and mining, should attract a more serious crowd than Creative. Creative mode is filled with a ton of kids who screw around because for one, it&#39;s free, and second, it&#39;s easy to build and destroy and do whatever."
