Yeah, I was thinking about something like that, but those God damned animals seem to be able to get into nearly everything unless it can only be accessed by going deep underwater. That&#39;s why I connected it to my main tower, which has an underwater entrance. Thank God we&#39;re getting doors soon; it&#39;s going to make life 1,000% easier.

That and fixed water. I&#39;ve been assuming that I&#39;m not the only one who has broken water that won&#39;t flow...right?"

I think I might have to steal your greenhouse idea, though.[/url][/QUOTE]

Yeah, I was thinking about something like that, but those God damned animals seem to be able to get into nearly everything unless it can only be accessed by going deep underwater. That&#39;s why I connected it to my main tower, which has an underwater entrance. Thank God we&#39;re getting doors soon; it&#39;s going to make life 1,000% easier.

That and fixed water. I&#39;ve been assuming that I&#39;m not the only one who has broken water that won&#39;t flow...right?</span>

I usually just wander until I find a deposit of it. It might just be coincidence, but it seems like I usually find it at the foot of tall cliffs near areas that have overhanging land. It&#39;s usually near sand, too. But that could just be me."

Theres a variable in there to set the speed at which the blocks spawn, but thats limited to what the &quot;sbox_E2_maxPropsPerSecond&quot; is set at.
Also source can only handle 2048 entities before an engine error, and about 200 are already taken up, so you can only really have a max of about 1750 blocks.

Wow that was late."

Theres a variable in there to set the speed at which the blocks spawn, but thats limited to what the &quot;sbox_E2_maxPropsPerSecond&quot; is set at.

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=Darkomni;22386561]To anyone who thinks minecraft is a resource hog: trust me, it&#39;s not. For a 16x16x16 chunk of blocks, it has to take into account 4096 different blocks. That means every time that you go into infdev and take a look out over a landscape on a mountain, you&#39;re probably rendering tens of thousands of blocks, and processing hundreds of thousands that are unseen, underground, every frame. And yet, the majority of people here still get a framerate much higher than anybody would ever need.[/QUOTE]

Bro, I tried playing Minecraft on my laptop. I set the render distance to tiny and &quot;view bobbing&quot; to off. I had an average framerate of ~10 FPS and it froze every 2-3 seconds. :colbert:

Things I&#39;d like to see fixed/happen:

-Leaves falling in Infdev when the trunk is cut down
-Light in Indev at sunup/sundown
-Smaller random caves in Indev, random caves in Infdev
-BETTER OPTIMIZATION
-Sun/Moon visible even at render distance normal/short/tiny
-And, of course, multiplayer In(f)dev."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Darkomni;22386561]To anyone who thinks minecraft is a resource hog: trust me, it&#39;s not. For a 16x16x16 chunk of blocks, it has to take into account 4096 different blocks. That means every time that you go into infdev and take a look out over a landscape on a mountain, you&#39;re probably rendering tens of thousands of blocks, and processing hundreds of thousands that are unseen, underground, every frame. And yet, the majority of people here still get a framerate much higher than anybody would ever need.[/QUOTE]

Bro, I tried playing Minecraft on my laptop. I set the render distance to tiny and &quot;view bobbing&quot; to off. I had an average framerate of ~10 FPS and it froze every 2-3 seconds. :colbert:

FUCK YES[/QUOTE]

I fucking hate you.

Concerning note: I had a dream about Minecraft last night where I found a huge vein of Diamond. :geno:

[quote=Notch on his blog]So, well, at around noon yesterday, I got a phone call from UPS, saying they had a package for me. One hour later, I promised myself I’d just “check if it worked”, then get the Minecraft update out.[/quote]

After reading this, I was like HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT.

[quote=Notch on his blog]Well, turns out I didn’t. :D[/quote]

Then I raged. Hard.

[editline]11:35AM[/editline]

Things I&#39;d like to see fixed/happen:

-Leaves falling in Infdev when the trunk is cut down
-Light in Indev at sunup/sundown
-Smaller random caves in Indev, random caves in Infdev
-BETTER OPTIMIZATION
-Sun/Moon visible even at render distance normal/short/tiny
-And, of course, multiplayer In(f)dev.</span>
