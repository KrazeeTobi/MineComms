Yeah, pretty much this. When stuff like guilds and groups are started, the one simple rule should be to &quot;register&quot; with the local town&#39;s leader so the leader knows who you are and what you&#39;re doing. Then you can either accept work from the leader or be akin to a mercenary group and take on jobs from other players."

Oh and we need something for currency. Im assuming food and diamond would be it. That is the only stuff every player needs/can use.

Oh and if youre on a construction team you can get free food while building. Because the construction &quot;Company&quot; should also have a farmer."

Oh and we need something for currency. Im assuming food and diamond would be it. That is the only stuff every player needs/can use.

Oh and if youre on a construction team you can get free food while building. Because the construction &quot;Company&quot; should also have a farmer.[/QUOTE]

Well we&#39;re going to need a form of &quot;leaders&quot; regardless, especially to have op powers to ban/warn people who commit crime. There&#39;s no way an organized community type of setting is going to work out on its own two legs unless someone is there to oversee it and take action against unruly troublemakers.

I don&#39;t think a currency system would work in Minecraft. I think the economy should rely on trading. I.E. the local farmer/baker might ask for one of a certain selection of blocks for one bread. The farmer can then either use the goods for his own purposes or turn back around and trade them for other goods. The people will be able to make their own prices, but it&#39;ll balance out economy-wise with competition; so no one guy will be able to charge 10 diamonds for whatever good he&#39;s selling. Taking into account the distance between towns will also cause the economy to expand and different goods cost different prices in different places.

It&#39;ll all work out. Even if it is &quot;lol internet&quot;, as long as people take on specific jobs there will be specific needs and an economy will form."

Also I figure a system for new players would go like this.
1. Spawn in room and receive your own player locked door(presuming that doors are player locked and implemented before multi)
2. Get issued a government built house to stay in.
3. Get job at employers office
4. Do whatever

                            <span v-pre>I can&#39;t wait until we build straight onto the industrial age and start building cobblestone skyscrapers.
Also I figure a system for new players would go like this.
1. Spawn in room and receive your own player locked door(presuming that doors are player locked and implemented before multi)
2. Get issued a government built house to stay in.
3. Get job at employers office
4. Do whatever 
I figure this will give new players a place to start and give a basic feel of the server.</span>

Yes, exactly. Different jobs will work hand-in-hand with each other to be lucrative.

There can also be people who dabble in everything as dedicated traders/peddlers themselves. They have a certain mixed set of goods, go to a town that they know needs it, set up shop, trade the goods for other goods, then pack up and go to a different town where they know they&#39;ll get a profit off of their new set of goods. Some of these people could even be paid to ship a business&#39;s goods from one town to another; a shop owner can&#39;t leave for travel all the time.

But of course all of this is up to the people. We&#39;ll see how it happens when we get there. Right now I think the main things to think about are organization of government and getting people together to do certain jobs to get the central city started off (like you said). Once we&#39;re there and secure in a city, then people can start their businesses and begin building outward into the world."

1: Small shops (Bread, Furniture, Stone, Pork) to sell to people from inside and outside of the city.

2: The city&#39;s wheat farm.

3: The city&#39;s mine entrance or open pit mine.

4: Houses for the people who worked hard to build the city in the first place.

5: A random person&#39;s outpost where they can sell their own goods to people leaving the city.

And the main tower is where the Admins/OPs quarters will be. (and on the ground level in the center of the tower will be the spawn lobby) the tower will be high in the sky. It will also serve as a beacon and be covered in torches on the outside to aid in nightime direction.
This is based off the imperial city in Oblivion.

1: Small shops (Bread, Furniture, Stone, Pork) to sell to people from inside and outside of the city.

2: The city&#39;s wheat farm.

3: The city&#39;s mine entrance or open pit mine.

4: Houses for the people who worked hard to build the city in the first place.

5: A random person&#39;s outpost where they can sell their own goods to people leaving the city.

And the main tower is where the Admins/OPs quarters will be. (and on the ground level in the center of the tower will be the spawn lobby) the tower will be high in the sky. It will also serve as a beacon and be covered in torches on the outside to aid in nightime direction.
This is based off the imperial city in Oblivion.
