[B]What it is[/B]
An Economy Village. I studied an experiment in Psychology where some people stranded themselves in the wild with tools, and from nothing, made a city-y thing in a few years. We&#39;ll replicate that in Minecraft.

[B]How[/B]
In our Economy Village in Minecraft, we&#39;ll each do something. We can&#39;t do anything else. Imagine RP, but harder: you can only do what you are supposed to.

[B]Sounds hard[/B]
It is a bit. It&#39;s important that the participants really are dedicated to do this. This isn&#39;t your usual Minecraft experience.

[B]What will I do?[/B]
A few basic roles will be avaiable from the start. As the city evolves, much like in a real economy, more roles will be needed.
The starting ones will be:
[list][*][B]Dirt digger [/B]- Pretty self-explanatory: dig dirt, sell it to people for their stuff.
[*][B]Woodcutter[/B] - Chops trees, may make wood blocks. Can use an axe.
[*][B]Miner[/B] - Provides the city with rock, ores and coal.
[*][b]Craftsman[/b] - Crafts regular items, and tools up to Stone.
[*][B]Blacksmith[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Crafts Iron, Gold and Diamond tools. May smelt stone. [highlight]*[/highlight]Can have one other job.
[*][B]Shopkeeper[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Buys stuff. Sells stuff.
[*][B]Builder[/B] - Builds stuff. For a price.[/list]

It&#39;s gonna be pretty hard, but I think that if we find enough volunteers, it can be really interesting.
Players might not work somewhere else and must work only on their role for some time, though. If you&#39;re not interested on only this, don&#39;t ruin other people&#39;s game.

If you&#39;re in, let me know. If possible, PM, so I don&#39;t accidentally miss your post. Then I&#39;ll see a job for you :buddy:

[B]What it is[/B]
An Economy Village. I studied an experiment in Psychology where some people stranded themselves in the wild with tools, and from nothing, made a city-y thing in a few years. We&#39;ll replicate that in Minecraft.

[B]How[/B]
In our Economy Village in Minecraft, we&#39;ll each do something. We can&#39;t do anything else. Imagine RP, but harder: you can only do what you are supposed to.

[B]Sounds hard[/B]
It is a bit. It&#39;s important that the participants really are dedicated to do this. This isn&#39;t your usual Minecraft experience.

[B]What will I do?[/B]
A few basic roles will be avaiable from the start. As the city evolves, much like in a real economy, more roles will be needed.
The starting ones will be:
[list][*][B]Dirt digger [/B]- Pretty self-explanatory: dig dirt, sell it to people for their stuff.
[*][B]Woodcutter[/B] - Chops trees, may make wood blocks. Can use an axe.
[*][B]Miner[/B] - Provides the city with rock, ores and coal.
[*][b]Craftsman[/b] - Crafts regular items, and tools up to Stone.
[*][B]Blacksmith[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Crafts Iron, Gold and Diamond tools. May smelt stone. [highlight]*[/highlight]Can have one other job.
[*][B]Shopkeeper[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Buys stuff. Sells stuff.
[*][B]Builder[/B] - Builds stuff. For a price.[/list]

It&#39;s gonna be pretty hard, but I think that if we find enough volunteers, it can be really interesting.
Players might not work somewhere else and must work only on their role for some time, though. If you&#39;re not interested on only this, don&#39;t ruin other people&#39;s game.

If you&#39;re in, let me know. If possible, PM, so I don&#39;t accidentally miss your post. Then I&#39;ll see a job for you :buddy:

[B]What it is[/B]
An Economy Village. I studied an experiment in Psychology where some people stranded themselves in the wild with tools, and from nothing, made a city-y thing in a few years. We&#39;ll replicate that in Minecraft.

[B]How[/B]
In our Economy Village in Minecraft, we&#39;ll each do something. We can&#39;t do anything else. Imagine RP, but harder: you can only do what you are supposed to.

[B]Sounds hard[/B]
It is a bit. It&#39;s important that the participants really are dedicated to do this. This isn&#39;t your usual Minecraft experience.

[B]What will I do?[/B]
A few basic roles will be avaiable from the start. As the city evolves, much like in a real economy, more roles will be needed.
The starting ones will be:
[list][*][B]Dirt digger [/B]- Pretty self-explanatory: dig dirt, sell it to people for their stuff.
[*][B]Woodcutter[/B] - Chops trees, may make wood blocks. Can use an axe.
[*][B]Miner[/B] - Provides the city with rock, ores and coal.
[*][b]Craftsman[/b] - Crafts regular items, and tools up to Stone.
[*][B]Blacksmith[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Crafts Iron, Gold and Diamond tools. May smelt stone. [highlight]*[/highlight]Can have one other job.
[*][B]Shopkeeper[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Buys stuff. Sells stuff.
[*][B]Builder[/B] - Builds stuff. For a price.[/list]

It&#39;s gonna be pretty hard, but I think that if we find enough volunteers, it can be really interesting.
Players might not work somewhere else and must work only on their role for some time, though. If you&#39;re not interested on only this, don&#39;t ruin other people&#39;s game.

If you&#39;re in, let me know. If possible, PM, so I don&#39;t accidentally miss your post. Then I&#39;ll see a job for you :buddy:

At some point, you should add redstone electrician and railway engineer.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=pedroion;26812478]We&#39;ll be starting an old social experiment on Neon&#39;s server.

[B]What it is[/B]
An Economy Village. I studied an experiment in Psychology where some people stranded themselves in the wild with tools, and from nothing, made a city-y thing in a few years. We&#39;ll replicate that in Minecraft.

[B]How[/B]
In our Economy Village in Minecraft, we&#39;ll each do something. We can&#39;t do anything else. Imagine RP, but harder: you can only do what you are supposed to.

[B]Sounds hard[/B]
It is a bit. It&#39;s important that the participants really are dedicated to do this. This isn&#39;t your usual Minecraft experience.

[B]What will I do?[/B]
A few basic roles will be avaiable from the start. As the city evolves, much like in a real economy, more roles will be needed.
The starting ones will be:
[list][*][B]Dirt digger [/B]- Pretty self-explanatory: dig dirt, sell it to people for their stuff.
[*][B]Woodcutter[/B] - Chops trees, may make wood blocks. Can use an axe.
[*][B]Miner[/B] - Provides the city with rock, ores and coal.
[*][b]Craftsman[/b] - Crafts regular items, and tools up to Stone.
[*][B]Blacksmith[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Crafts Iron, Gold and Diamond tools. May smelt stone. [highlight]*[/highlight]Can have one other job.
[*][B]Shopkeeper[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Buys stuff. Sells stuff.
[*][B]Builder[/B] - Builds stuff. For a price.[/list]

It&#39;s gonna be pretty hard, but I think that if we find enough volunteers, it can be really interesting.
Players might not work somewhere else and must work only on their role for some time, though. If you&#39;re not interested on only this, don&#39;t ruin other people&#39;s game.

If you&#39;re in, let me know. If possible, PM, so I don&#39;t accidentally miss your post. Then I&#39;ll see a job for you :buddy:

[B]What it is[/B]
An Economy Village. I studied an experiment in Psychology where some people stranded themselves in the wild with tools, and from nothing, made a city-y thing in a few years. We&#39;ll replicate that in Minecraft.

[B]How[/B]
In our Economy Village in Minecraft, we&#39;ll each do something. We can&#39;t do anything else. Imagine RP, but harder: you can only do what you are supposed to.

[B]Sounds hard[/B]
It is a bit. It&#39;s important that the participants really are dedicated to do this. This isn&#39;t your usual Minecraft experience.

[B]What will I do?[/B]
A few basic roles will be avaiable from the start. As the city evolves, much like in a real economy, more roles will be needed.
The starting ones will be:
[list][*][B]Dirt digger [/B]- Pretty self-explanatory: dig dirt, sell it to people for their stuff.
[*][B]Woodcutter[/B] - Chops trees, may make wood blocks. Can use an axe.
[*][B]Miner[/B] - Provides the city with rock, ores and coal.
[*][b]Craftsman[/b] - Crafts regular items, and tools up to Stone.
[*][B]Blacksmith[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Crafts Iron, Gold and Diamond tools. May smelt stone. [highlight]*[/highlight]Can have one other job.
[*][B]Shopkeeper[/B][highlight]*[/highlight] - Buys stuff. Sells stuff.
[*][B]Builder[/B] - Builds stuff. For a price.[/list]

It&#39;s gonna be pretty hard, but I think that if we find enough volunteers, it can be really interesting.
Players might not work somewhere else and must work only on their role for some time, though. If you&#39;re not interested on only this, don&#39;t ruin other people&#39;s game.

If you&#39;re in, let me know. If possible, PM, so I don&#39;t accidentally miss your post. Then I&#39;ll see a job for you :buddy:
