&quot;I&#39;m sorry for the... lack of furnishing. I&#39;m re-decorating the castle, as I&#39;m considering finding a mate. We can&#39;t live on getting in more people all the time, eh? We have to get some newborns in here. You should think about it too! Anyways, to the point...
I kind of feared this would happen one day, that... that you and Alfred would stumble upon unusual people. You&#39;ve become pretty dear friends, I understand?&quot;

&quot;Ah. Well you see, the people you found can cause great havoc. A tamed animal is one thing. But a Creeper... it&#39;s not an animal, son. Once it breeds, the result will be devastating. The children of a tame Creeper will be the absolute opposite of tame, and the explosion can reach a strength of 150 megaton, with a blast-radius of god-knows-what.&quot;

Edit: These are all of basically the same angle, because I was being very lazy and then I just uploaded and linked them all. Top three are day, and bottom three are night, I believe.
Just watch the video if you want to see it better.

(As a swordfight is impossible to do with an already petted human, just watch this sword-fight and listen to the conversations, but imagine that Will Turner is our protagonist and Jack Sparrow is The Master.)

After a few stabs to the arms, I finally cornered The Master, and in a hope of getting some information out of him, I ask:
&quot;Who are you, really, and why do you brainwash the people who live in D.H?&quot;
[img_thumb]http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/6850/fight2.png[/img_thumb]

He smiled at me while breathing heavily, and collapsed to the ground.
&quot;My name is Henry Mastruss. My grandfath-&quot;
He stopped himself and spit out some blood, and took a few gasps of breath.
&quot;My grandfather was the creator of D.H! For a long time he had collected material to build with, and several friends of his helped him with building. For the longest time they had lived in the deserts, fending off animals and vile creatures. Then was my father, and now me. And I ha-&quot;
&quot;I did not ask for your life story, Henry, I asked why you are doing this to your people!&quot; I yelled.
His smile widened as he wiped some blood off his mouth.
&quot;What you do not understand, kid, is that I&#39;m not the one brainwashing them, as you call it. The [i]desert[/i] is. Remember how Alfred told you that the lands are evil?&quot;
I stood still for a moment trying to grasp what he said.
&quot;How do you know about that?&quot; I asked calmly.
&quot;Spies. you really thinkI can trust anyone to get people in here all by themselves? I want to know who you bring in, and what is said during your little trip in the Desertlands.&quot;
He spit some more blood on the ground.
&quot;What Alfred said is right. These lands are... Not for the faint of heart. After a few days out there, you will go mad. My grandfather wasn&#39;t very sane either. People who grew up in &quot;captivity&quot; can never develop this kind of paranoia. People who were picked up in the desert, however, will instantly worship the owner of this city for taking them in.&quot;

I lowered my sword. What he said was completely logical.
&quot;Whatever the reason they&#39;re brainwashed&quot;, I said silently. &quot;It does not make up for the fact that you&#39;ve killed 5 people to keep two people away.&quot;
I jabbed my sword into his heart. As he twitched and tried to grasp any air around him, I swear I heard him call me a fool. But it was too late now. He sunk together, and I let go of the handle.

The Master was dead."
