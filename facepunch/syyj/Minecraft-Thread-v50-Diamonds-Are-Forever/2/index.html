A long, long time ago, before the days of LOL, there were no ROFLCopters to defend the nation from invaders. This was before the days of ASCII, when there was only ASCI.

One day, an adventurer known as Bob arrived in WTFTown, after a long, hard journey from LOLCity, to seek his riches &amp;#8216;n stuff. He had heard tales of the ROFLDragon&amp;#8217;s infamous deeds and vowed to sleigh him for the good of the nation and a healthy supply of ROFLWaffles. Bob entered the town square, and immediately sought out the guy who was important and stuff. Yeah, you get the idea, &amp;#8220;Go defeat the Rofldragon blah blah blah&amp;#8221;, so Bob was all &amp;#8220;W/e&amp;#8221; and climbed Mt. Noob, seeking out the ROFLDragon. Bob had remembered to bring his AFK47 and Mini-ROFLING gun, along with some WTFBOOM-class LOLNades, which was kinda good cause he usually forgot those and stuff.

Along the way, Bob met a friendly hermit, who begged him for some spare change. Bob didn&amp;#8217;t like friendly hermits, so he kindly donated a LOLNade to the hermit. Unbeknownst to Bob, he forgot to pull the pin and the hermit later sold the grenade to a museum and became really rich and started up a LOLCake factory, which eventually was shut down because of health and safety regulations. So Bob trundled along the dusty road upwards, where nothing interesting happened until the next paragraph.

Bob climbed the slopey steeps of Mt. Noob, eventually finding himself outside the lair of the ROFLDragon. By now, Bob was hungry, so he had some LOLCakes and some other joke i haven&amp;#8217;t made yet. Anyway, he defeated the ROFLDragon and sleighed him for the army, but then they made ROFLCopters with ROFLing guns, and a WTFBOOM launcher, so they kinda went out if fashion and Bob lost his job as ROFLCopters don&amp;#8217;t need any training unlike ROFLDragons, he then began to protest as he still hadn&amp;#8217;t laughed at this post since it began.[/quote]

Also, ROFLWAFFLES.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=TraderRager;26704306]And before people accuse me of being hypocritical of about Furries, they are welcomed to their fetish. But they are NOT a culture. They are NOT discriminated against for their beliefs, and it is NOT a Sexual orientation. It&#39;s a bunch of people on the internet who fantasize about having sex with people who have fur all over their bodies, and generally push it in other peoples faces. I know perfectly well adjusted people who are furries, and they do not consider it a culture and more then a forum of people who enjoy bondage.[/QUOTE]
 
We are SO a culture!

I get a Steam message from a good friend of mine, &quot;Want to watch me Livestream Minecraft?&quot; I responded with, &quot;What the hell is Minecraft?&quot;

And so my adventure began.

I watched him Livestream for about a half hour, with my occasional comment and question. &quot;The graphics are strange, unique. I like it.&quot; I had said. He got killed by a skeleton, and after that, he told me how surprisingly creep(er)y caves in the game were, and I laughed at him. &quot;Scared of cubes? What is so scary about a bunch of squares?&quot;

He sent me his account details (he&#39;s pretty awesome, by the way) and let me play by mooching off his account. After about a month of non-stop play, I realized...Minecraft. Awesome. About a week after my realization, I brought my laptop to my friends house. After much (and I cannot stress how much I mean by [I]much[/I]) coaxing, I finally got him to log on (using my other friends account details). He was enraptured by the beauty of Minecraft.

Now, hear me out. The friend that I referred to was usually on Steam all day erry day. I introduced him to Minecraft. He wasn&#39;t on Steam for 2 and a half weeks. When he finally logged on one day, I questioned, &quot;Where the hell were you?&quot; And his response?


&quot;Minecraft.&quot;


Eventually, he bought his own account. Just recently, (about a day or 2 ago, actually) I finally got some money and bought my own account.
