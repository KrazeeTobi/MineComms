This is why I hate Minecraft threads. People never help but expect you to be nice, even though one simple mistake and they go batshit on your ass over it (Or at least one person does) because apparently &quot;Real Minecrafters are perfect!&quot; Even though they&#39;re far from it.
 
You guys are a bunch of assholes. You sit around trying to &quot;impress&quot; each other by showing off the &quot;impressive stuff&quot; you made in LEG- I mean Minecraft because you have nothing better to do but sit on your asses and obsess over a retarded little overrated Indy game.
 
OOOOOoooo I build things! You say, so I say &quot;It&#39;s a rip-off of LEGO added to a terrible survival game to give it imposed value&quot;
 
So you guys say &quot;But you have to build tools to get stuff to build!&quot; So I say &quot;Just another attempt to make it look less like a rip-off.&quot;
 
You guys all suck, your stupid, shit Indy game sucks, and NOTCH SUCKS TO!
 
Go fuck yourselves. I hope I get banned so I don&#39;t have to be part of this Fucking thread.

This is why I hate Minecraft threads. People never help but expect you to be nice, even though one simple mistake and they go batshit on your ass over it (Or at least one person does) because apparently &quot;Real Minecrafters are perfect!&quot; Even though they&#39;re far from it.
 
You guys are a bunch of assholes. You sit around trying to &quot;impress&quot; each other by showing off the &quot;impressive stuff&quot; you made in LEG- I mean Minecraft because you have nothing better to do but sit on your asses and obsess over a retarded little overrated Indy game.
 
OOOOOoooo I build things! You say, so I say &quot;It&#39;s a rip-off of LEGO added to a terrible survival game to give it imposed value&quot;
 
So you guys say &quot;But you have to build tools to get stuff to build!&quot; So I say &quot;Just another attempt to make it look less like a rip-off.&quot;
 
You guys all suck, your stupid, shit Indy game sucks, and NOTCH SUCKS TO!
 
Go fuck yourselves. I hope I get banned so I don&#39;t have to be part of this Fucking thread.

Well, you guys also tolerated that Rage Post well. I guess I&#39;ll continue posting because you put up with the rage without starting an arguement. I&#39;ll snip that post if you want.
 
Still, although I raged, it just all could be avoided if you guys weren&#39;t being so stuck up. Every mistake I make someone starts telling me off every Minecraft thread. So lets not do that please.
 
Oh, and the reason I quoted that pic was becase it&#39;s teasing me. Thanks Da Jester.

There aren&#39;t enough dumbs in the world because you are so wrong it&#39;s not even funny. This is a great community and the only reason anyone ever forms a hatred of it is because of user error. It doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t like the game, say your piece and leave, and besides that, you were trying earlier on in the thread to become part of the community and now this? If you hate the game or the thread enough to rant about it in a thread full of people who LIKE BOTH OF THOSE THINGS, then just leave, sheesh. You don&#39;t have to go nuts on us.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=BananaFoam;26741185]Well, you guys also tolerated that Rage Post well. I guess I&#39;ll continue posting because you put up with the rage without starting an arguement. I&#39;ll snip that post if you want.
 
Still, although I raged, it just all could be avoided if you guys weren&#39;t being so stuck up. Every mistake I make someone starts telling me off every Minecraft thread. So lets not do that please.
 
So please help and I&#39;ll be on my way.[/QUOTE]

This is why I hate Minecraft threads. People never help but expect you to be nice, even though one simple mistake and they go batshit on your ass over it (Or at least one person does) because apparently &quot;Real Minecrafters are perfect!&quot; Even though they&#39;re far from it.

You guys are a bunch of assholes. You sit around trying to &quot;impress&quot; each other by showing off the &quot;impressive stuff&quot; you made in LEG- I mean Minecraft because you have nothing better to do but sit on your asses and obsess over a retarded little overrated Indy game.

OOOOOoooo I build things! You say, so I say &quot;It&#39;s a rip-off of LEGO added to a terrible survival game to give it imposed value&quot;

So you guys say &quot;But you have to build tools to get stuff to build!&quot; So I say &quot;Just another attempt to make it look less like a rip-off.&quot;

You guys all suck, your stupid, shit Indy game sucks, and NOTCH SUCKS TO!

Go fuck yourselves. I hope I get banned so I don&#39;t have to be part of this Fucking thread.

Thanks for your help, assholes.[/quote]

By the way, why don&#39;t you leave if you want to be banned? It&#39;s better to just leave us alone and not be banned than rage and never be a Facepuncher again."

This is why I hate Minecraft threads. People never help but expect you to be nice, even though one simple mistake and they go batshit on your ass over it (Or at least one person does) because apparently &quot;Real Minecrafters are perfect!&quot; Even though they&#39;re far from it.

You guys are a bunch of assholes. You sit around trying to &quot;impress&quot; each other by showing off the &quot;impressive stuff&quot; you made in LEG- I mean Minecraft because you have nothing better to do but sit on your asses and obsess over a retarded little overrated Indy game.

OOOOOoooo I build things! You say, so I say &quot;It&#39;s a rip-off of LEGO added to a terrible survival game to give it imposed value&quot;

So you guys say &quot;But you have to build tools to get stuff to build!&quot; So I say &quot;Just another attempt to make it look less like a rip-off.&quot;

You guys all suck, your stupid, shit Indy game sucks, and NOTCH SUCKS TO!

Go fuck yourselves. I hope I get banned so I don&#39;t have to be part of this Fucking thread.

Thanks for your help, assholes.[/quote]

By the way, why don&#39;t you leave if you want to be banned? It&#39;s better to just leave us alone and not be banned than rage and never be a Facepuncher again.</span>
