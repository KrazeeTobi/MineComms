Also, anyone got a decent tutorial for Java and a way to de-mindfuck-erise Notch&#39;s class files so I can go around fixing various atrocities that I keep noticing in my game? (AHEM AHEM UN-HUED GRASS-SIDES FOR ONE THING)

I see what you mean. It simply becomes an annoyance rather than an addition to gameplay. I never really played Hardcore mode that much (I got stuck on a side quest because I didn&#39;t have high enough speech) so I stopped playing for awhile.
 
I also think it&#39;s still a bit early for Beta. Beta is the stage of development where you iron out bugs, but Notch says he&#39;s going to add stuff during Beta, which isn&#39;t really a good idea. I think it should stay in Alpha a little while longer, until Notch is shure he&#39;s added everything he wants to the game."

1. Install mods.
2. Craft &quot;Pet Rod&quot; using the included recipe.
3. Get a pet/slave.
4. Click E to select the order you want.
5. Wield your Rod, aim at your pet, and right-click to give them an order.
Done.

Half-way through the night, a group of people found us by the campfire. What we didn&#39;t expect, was them to carry with them a wild animal.
[img_thumb]http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/5617/20101216053915.png[/img_thumb]

They had their own friendly Creeper with them! How they had tamed it, they wouldn&#39;t tell us. They however did promise us, that if we let them come with us, they would tame any animal we wanted. The Master would love these people!

As the night slowly subsided into day, me and Alfred realised that it was time to head back. The reason we were being sent out during night, was that according to The Master, people search for light during the night. The horrors of the Desertland couldn&#39;t get to them in the light, and D.H was pretty damn filled with lights...
