I don&#39;t think you quite comprehend that developing Minecraft is notch&#39;s JOB.
It&#39;s not a side project, it&#39;s not something he spends a few hours on each week.
He spends MOST of his day, DEVELOPING MINECRAFT, AS A JOB.
A FULL TIME JOB.
And it&#39;s now been MONTHS, and the only thing we got, was a lot of bugs and lag and broken crap.
Now you have to wonder, how did all this broken crap get through?
The only way this could have happened is if Notch NEVER played the game after he did...whatever he did!
And I&#39;m not even sure WHAT he did, he didnt ADD anything, he hasn&#39;t CHANGED anything, it&#39;s just suddenly got spontaneously laggy.
That says to me that he literally rushed this out in about an hour, I&#39;m not even kidding, to have not even PLAYED the game more than 10 minutes to notice all this crashing and lagging, he&#39;d have to have spent no more than an hour on this update, at the most.
Spending an hour on Minecraft in over 3 weeks, while developing it is a 9 to 5, 5 days a week job?
Makes you wonder what he was doing in all the other time he had eh?
Oh right, live streaming himself coding a completely different thing that would never get released for absolutely no rhyme or reason or purpose.

OH BUT LUST, IT&#39;S A BETA, IT&#39;S MEANT TO BE BUGGY.
Yeah, lovely, I&#39;d understand it being MORE buggy if he&#39;d actually ADDED anything of substance in the, what, 4 months of no significant content we&#39;ve had?
OH BUT LUST, HE&#39;S RELEASED FISHING RODS, THAT DIDN&#39;T WORK FOR A LONG ASS TIME AND THEN TURNED OUT TO BE ALMOST USELESS.
OH AND A CLOCK, THAT WAS A RETEXTURE OF A COMPASS THAT NO ONE WANTED BECAUSE IT ONLY POINTS TO THE SPAWN.
OH AND HE ADDED NEW BLO- Oh wait no he didn&#39;t.
OH AND HE REMOVED LEAF DECAY, AND THEN ADDED IT IN WITH EXTREME-LAG EVEN THOUGH ITS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT WAS IN ALPHA.

Yeah, features that worked perfectly fine in Alpha are suddenly broken in Beta, that makes so much sense.
It kind of makes me wonder what the fuck he did, I can&#39;t even BEGIN to comprehend HOW he did this, he&#39;s got more money than most game development companies, it&#39;s a full time job, he &quot;works&quot; hours every day, and somehow he&#39;s managed to release absolutely nothing while breaking everything.

It boggles the mind how fucking lazy Notch must be getting for this to have happened.

And also enough of this discount bullshit, it&#39;s not a discount, it&#39;s just Notch saying that he&#39;ll raise the price.
You can&#39;t have a discount if it wasn&#39;t at that price to begin with.
OH LOOK, I WOULD SELL THIS PIECE OF CRAP FOR &#163;500, BUT I&#39;M GIVING IT TO YOU FOR JUST &#163;50, YOU&#39;RE GETTING IT FOR JUST 1/10TH OF THE PRICE I WOULD HAVE SOLD IT AT, SO YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR IT BEING TOTALLY BROKEN.

No, he&#39;s not giving you a &#39;discount&#39;.
He&#39;s giving it to you for a regular price, then slowly raising it over time."

[QUOTE=Lust;26851224]It really annoys to me to see all these people defending Notch and saying &#39;It&#39;s a beta it&#39;s meant to be buggy!&#39;
I don&#39;t think you quite comprehend that developing Minecraft is notch&#39;s JOB.
It&#39;s not a side project, it&#39;s not something he spends a few hours on each week.
He spends MOST of his day, DEVELOPING MINECRAFT, AS A JOB.
A FULL TIME JOB.
And it&#39;s now been MONTHS, and the only thing we got, was a lot of bugs and lag and broken crap.
Now you have to wonder, how did all this broken crap get through?
The only way this could have happened is if Notch NEVER played the game after he did...whatever he did!
And I&#39;m not even sure WHAT he did, he didnt ADD anything, he hasn&#39;t CHANGED anything, it&#39;s just suddenly got spontaneously laggy.
That says to me that he literally rushed this out in about an hour, I&#39;m not even kidding, to have not even PLAYED the game more than 10 minutes to notice all this crashing and lagging, he&#39;d have to have spent no more than an hour on this update, at the most.
Spending an hour on Minecraft in over 3 weeks, while developing it is a 9 to 5, 5 days a week job?
Makes you wonder what he was doing in all the other time he had eh?
Oh right, live streaming himself coding a completely different thing that would never get released for absolutely no rhyme or reason or purpose.

OH BUT LUST, IT&#39;S A BETA, IT&#39;S MEANT TO BE BUGGY.
Yeah, lovely, I&#39;d understand it being MORE buggy if he&#39;d actually ADDED anything of substance in the, what, 4 months of no significant content we&#39;ve had?
OH BUT LUST, HE&#39;S RELEASED FISHING RODS, THAT DIDN&#39;T WORK FOR A LONG ASS TIME AND THEN TURNED OUT TO BE ALMOST USELESS.
OH AND A CLOCK, THAT WAS A RETEXTURE OF A COMPASS THAT NO ONE WANTED BECAUSE IT ONLY POINTS TO THE SPAWN.
OH AND HE ADDED NEW BLO- Oh wait no he didn&#39;t.
OH AND HE REMOVED LEAF DECAY, AND THEN ADDED IT IN WITH EXTREME-LAG EVEN THOUGH ITS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT WAS IN ALPHA.

Yeah, features that worked perfectly fine in Alpha are suddenly broken in Beta, that makes so much sense.
It kind of makes me wonder what the fuck he did, I can&#39;t even BEGIN to comprehend HOW he did this, he&#39;s got more money than most game development companies, it&#39;s a full time job, he &quot;works&quot; hours every day, and somehow he&#39;s managed to release absolutely nothing while breaking everything.

It boggles the mind how fucking lazy Notch must be getting for this to have happened.

Prepare for copious amounts of &quot;OMG BUT IT&#39;S A BETA ASDGADDDFGDA&quot;

And also enough of this discount bullshit, it&#39;s not a discount, it&#39;s just Notch saying that he&#39;ll raise the price.
You can&#39;t have a discount if it wasn&#39;t at that price to begin with.
OH LOOK, I WOULD SELL THIS PIECE OF CRAP FOR &#163;500, BUT I&#39;M GIVING IT TO YOU FOR JUST &#163;50, YOU&#39;RE GETTING IT FOR JUST 1/10TH OF THE PRICE I WOULD HAVE SOLD IT AT, SO YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR IT BEING TOTALLY BROKEN.

No, he&#39;s not giving you a &#39;discount&#39;.
He&#39;s giving it to you for a regular price, then slowly raising it over time.[/QUOTE]"

It boggles the mind how fucking lazy Notch must be getting for this to have happened.

Prepare for copious amounts of &quot;OMG BUT IT&#39;S A BETA ASDGADDDFGDA&quot;

And also enough of this discount bullshit, it&#39;s not a discount, it&#39;s just Notch saying that he&#39;ll raise the price.
You can&#39;t have a discount if it wasn&#39;t at that price to begin with.
OH LOOK, I WOULD SELL THIS PIECE OF CRAP FOR &#163;500, BUT I&#39;M GIVING IT TO YOU FOR JUST &#163;50, YOU&#39;RE GETTING IT FOR JUST 1/10TH OF THE PRICE I WOULD HAVE SOLD IT AT, SO YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR IT BEING TOTALLY BROKEN.

No, he&#39;s not giving you a &#39;discount&#39;.
He&#39;s giving it to you for a regular price, then slowly raising it over time.[/QUOTE]</span>

Seriously, all you people defending him, think about your logic.
It took us TEN SECONDS to get crashes and bugs.
So for him to have NOT noticed this, it means he spent less than TEN SECONDS &#39;testing&#39; his...New additions to the game?

He fixed Biomes?
Wait, were they SUPPOSED to be 5 square wide patches of snow and sand randomly dispersed throughout forests?

Seriously, all you people defending him, think about your logic.
It took us TEN SECONDS to get crashes and bugs.
So for him to have NOT noticed this, it means he spent less than TEN SECONDS &#39;testing&#39; his...New additions to the game?

So yes, I was being very fucking literal when I said he must have spent less than an hour on Minecraft for the past few weeks.</span>

The bug is caused by connecting to a server from an external IP. My guess is he playtests it on a local network, therefore he didn&#39;t catch the issue.

I don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re making such a big deal over a small mistake that&#39;ll be fixed soon enough. By pure definition - &quot;A software version released to a limited population of users for functionality and bug test evaluation before the final release to the general user base.&quot; We thoroughly expect issues, I don&#39;t see why you purchased a beta/alpha and didn&#39;t expect issues.[/QUOTE]
 
Everything about this statement is so wrong and so absolutely stupid that I can&#39;t actually think of how to retort.
Oh, aside from the dictionary definition he copy pasted, that&#39;s correct.</span>

Yes Kapin Krunch, it&#39;s worth it because we&#39;re paying for content that we already have to be broken, and content that doesn&#39;t exist and hasn&#39;t been thought of yet to be added later for people to pay more for.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=kapin_krunch;26851569]Yeah I get what you mean with the &quot;we don&#39;t really pay less&quot; thing but remember, 
all the people who buy it at the proper release (and maybe at beta as well? I can&#39;t remember) have to pay for extra content that will be released other than the standard game and we won&#39;t.
 So really it is worth dealing with the bug that happen in alpha and beta because we will have to pay a lot less for the same content.[/QUOTE]
 
Yes Kapin Krunch, it&#39;s worth it because we&#39;re paying for content that we already have to be broken, and content that doesn&#39;t exist and hasn&#39;t been thought of yet to be added later for people to pay more for.

Wait, what?</span>

Yes, the content that doesn&#39;t exist and hasn&#39;t been thought of yet.
And the assurance that nothing will be broken in the far future that hasn&#39;t happened yet.

Why do you keep attempting to use things that don&#39;t exist/havent happened yet as points in conversation."
