Yes, and in all of them, there is a queen mob that if you kill, all of the monsters originating from that hive become docile/will die. That could be an awesome way to clear your area of monsters (although, some should still spawn randomly to spice things up). 

Maybe the hive material could be a new block that mobs have a much higher chance to spawn on."

Yes, and in all of them, there is a queen mob that if you kill, all of the monsters originating from that hive become docile/will die. That could be an awesome way to clear your area of monsters (although, some should still spawn randomly to spice things up). 

Maybe the hive material could be a new block that mobs have a much higher chance to spawn on.</span>
