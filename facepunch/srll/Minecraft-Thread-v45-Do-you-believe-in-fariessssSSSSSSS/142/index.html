So, with the Halloween update, we were introduced to biomes and fish.  Excited by the prospect of snow, I built myself an igloo, complete with a fire moat surrounding it, which used the new netherstone, also included in the update.  It was nothing that impressive for an average Minecraft player, but I was proud of it.

[URL=http://imgur.com/ZU3re.png][IMG]http://imgur.com/ZU3rel.jpg[/IMG][/URL]

My igloo, however, was very lonely.  After long days exploring mines, oceans and forests, I would come home to an empty igloo.  So, I decided to go and find myself some friends.

I waited until nightfall, and viciously attacked every spider I could find.  I was eventually able to collect the string required to craft a fishing pole.  The next morning, I headed out to my fishing pond, and wrangled a fish.  He was a cute little fella, certainly no trophy winner, but I thought that we would be good friends.  I also caught a couple fellow fish to keep him company while I was away.  

[URL=http://imgur.com/j9s9s.png][IMG]http://imgur.com/j9s9sl.jpg[/IMG][/URL]

For them I constructed a fish tank of the highest quality.  A large glass tank, with ample lighting, a gravel bottom, and pristine water.  They rejoiced at the excitement of having their own home, safe from renegade chickens and spiders that they would encounter outside.

[URL=http://imgur.com/W8zrD.png][IMG]http://imgur.com/W8zrDl.jpg[/IMG][/URL]

We talked, laughed, and shot the breeze all through the night.  Life, love, hate, everything was a topic of conversation.  We had a lot of fun getting to know each other.  I couldn&#39;t have asked for better friends.

[URL=http://imgur.com/jcvxN.png][IMG]http://imgur.com/jcvxNl.jpg[/IMG][/URL]

The next day, I bid farewell to my fishy friends, and set out on a long trek.  I traveled into my mine, and found plenty of gold and diamond.  I rushed home to tell my fish the good news, and...

[URL=http://imgur.com/ODTGV.png][IMG]http://imgur.com/ODTGVl.jpg[/IMG][/URL]

The fish were gone.  I was heartbroken.  Even thought we had just gotten to know each other, I felt that we had shared something special, a friendship that would have lasted longer than our lives could contain.  Sadly, theirs were cut short.

This is a formal appeal to Notch, to please change the item system, so that my fish do not disappear when I leave.  I just want them to be happy.  

In memory of Mr. Fish."

So, with the Halloween update, we were introduced to biomes and fish.  Excited by the prospect of snow, I built myself an igloo, complete with a fire moat surrounding it, which used the new netherstone, also included in the update.  It was nothing that impressive for an average Minecraft player, but I was proud of it.

[URL=http://imgur.com/ZU3re.png][img_thumb]http://imgur.com/ZU3rel.jpg[/img_thumb][/URL]

My igloo, however, was very lonely.  After long days exploring mines, oceans and forests, I would come home to an empty igloo.  So, I decided to go and find myself some friends.

I waited until nightfall, and viciously attacked every spider I could find.  I was eventually able to collect the string required to craft a fishing pole.  The next morning, I headed out to my fishing pond, and wrangled a fish.  He was a cute little fella, certainly no trophy winner, but I thought that we would be good friends.  I also caught a couple fellow fish to keep him company while I was away.  

[URL=http://imgur.com/j9s9s.png][img_thumb]http://imgur.com/j9s9sl.jpg[/img_thumb][/URL]

For them I constructed a fish tank of the highest quality.  A large glass tank, with ample lighting, a gravel bottom, and pristine water.  They rejoiced at the excitement of having their own home, safe from renegade chickens and spiders that they would encounter outside.

We talked, laughed, and shot the breeze all through the night.  Life, love, hate, everything was a topic of conversation.  We had a lot of fun getting to know each other.  I couldn&#39;t have asked for better friends.

[URL=http://imgur.com/jcvxN.png][img_thumb]http://imgur.com/jcvxNl.jpg[/img_thumb][/URL]

The next day, I bid farewell to my fishy friends, and set out on a long trek.  I traveled into my mine, and found plenty of gold and diamond.  I rushed home to tell my fish the good news, and...

[URL=http://imgur.com/ODTGV.png][img_thumb]http://imgur.com/ODTGVl.jpg[/img_thumb][/URL]

The fish were gone.  I was heartbroken.  Even thought we had just gotten to know each other, I felt that we had shared something special, a friendship that would have lasted longer than our lives could contain.  Sadly, theirs were cut short.

This is a formal appeal to Notch, to please change the item system, so that my fish do not disappear when I leave.  I just want them to be happy.

Notch already said that the Fish will eventually become REAL mobs, rather than just items. So then you can have your live fish swimming around indefinitely."
