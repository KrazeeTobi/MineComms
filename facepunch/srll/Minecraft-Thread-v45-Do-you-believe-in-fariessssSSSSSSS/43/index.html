Hm... That&#39;s kinda odd. I always play it maximized. When are you maximizing it? When you first start it up or after you get into a world?"

The length of that really long road is close to 1300 blocks in length, and it&#39;s 7 blocks wide. One end has the current city I&#39;m working on, and the other end right now is a castle in progress.

[QUOTE=muckuruxx;25865782]You make the best King of Page. Where do you find the music for your videos?[/QUOTE]
 
Thanks :unsmith:

Most of the time, I simply go through my rather massive music library and find something within 5 seconds longer or shorter of the duration of the video, and if I can&#39;t find something I like I simply find something that have the same tempo or atmosphere of the video and then find a part of that I use. For this I simply was listening to Armin Van Buuren a lot recently and wanted to use one."

Yes. I&#39;d love to. Would be like a dream to do this kind of stuff, but as a job.

[QUOTE=muckuruxx;25865782]You make the best King of Page. Where do you find the music for your videos?[/QUOTE]
 
Thanks :unsmith:

Most of the time, I simply go through my rather massive music library and find something within 5 seconds longer or shorter of the duration of the video, and if I can&#39;t find something I like I simply find something that have the same tempo or atmosphere of the video and then find a part of that I use. For this I simply was listening to Armin Van Buuren a lot recently and wanted to use one.</span>

                            <span v-pre>[quote=daijitsu;25867115]it&#39;s just... There. Ever since i built up my first hellgate, this has been itching me. You ever get that feeling there&#39;s a mob right behind you? Like that creeper sense where you know just when to turn around before they decide to ssssss

i keep feeling it, even when i turn it to peaceful. I&#39;ll hear something and whip around only to be greeted by a few torches and an empty hallway. I&#39;ve gotten into the habit of placing sand down in hallways as i progress to ensure mobs can&#39;t get in from the outside, a dark place i missed or just some stupid new mob spawn glitch, i don&#39;t know how the new spawns work yet. Just peace of mind... But i&#39;ve really become paranoid as of the past few days, it&#39;s weird. I understand there&#39;s mobs that will spawn but they&#39;re predictable. They&#39;&#39;ll exist until you get too close and they&#39;ll just meander over and do their thing, making sounds to alert you that they&#39;re pissed off, you kill them, whatever.

But this isn&#39;t something to fear for that. No, it&#39;s just toying with me. It does things like make punching sounds against stone nearby. Blocks never break, but you hear a &#39;thunk&#39; now and again, sometimes if i&#39;m i&#39;m mining for a while and stop, you&#39;ll hear something else clunk-clunk-clunk against the rock face in front of me, but faint. Maybe three or four blocks ahead. I abandoned those hall projects, they just end now. Filled with torches, just in case.

You&#39;ll see an black smoke sprite from a fire effect drift across a hall, or that overlay that dims your vision when night falls just kind of pinches in a bit, making things feel cramped. It&#39;s just gotta be me, i&#39;m sure of it. Standing too close to a torch, maybe walking too far from the torchlight and it&#39;s darkening the overlay but glitches not to open back up when you approach the light for a while.

But still. There&#39;s something weird. I won&#39;t go around corners without my sword drawn, i&#39;ve switched to peaceful to convince myself the footsteps i may hear are just a sheep or something, but there&#39;s never any animal noises. Not down in the caves. Just the occasional skuttle of footsteps. Maybe it&#39;s just my character readjusting when i turn around.
