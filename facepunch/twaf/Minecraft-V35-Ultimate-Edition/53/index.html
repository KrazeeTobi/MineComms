I never said that. I never ONCE even implied that nobody cares if a bug is fixed because one person is complaining about it. You still don&#39;t get it. I said that Notch does not care when you think he should fix something in comparison with his real life or other things he wants to add into minecraft, the game which you paid between ten and fifteen dollars to play, that is an alpha and therefore unfinished which means in turn that the bugs are completely understandable.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Doomish;24210777]I never said that. I never ONCE even implied that nobody cares if a bug is fixed because one person is complaining about it. You still don&#39;t get it. I said that Notch does not care WHEN YOU THINK HE SHOULD FIX SOMETHING IN COMPARISON WITH HIS REAL LIFE OR OTHER THINGS HE WANTS TO ADD INTO MINECRAFT, THE GAME WHICH YOU PAID BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN DOLLARS TO PLAY, THAT IS AN ALPHA AND THEREFORE UNFINISHED WHICH MEANS IN TURN THAT THE BUGS ARE COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE.

Oh, and he is also a greedy, ugly bald-headed retard who wants to sellout his shitty Mojang &quot;company&quot; that he dreamed up during his nappy time, to another game company (which will NEVER happen).

 He also occasional raves about his fictional &quot;girlfriend&quot;, who he is now engaged to ( but is actually his mom). He jerks off to his retarted 12 year old fanbase as well (they also circle-jerk together).

He likes to make blogs about his fake life, and whatever video game he is playing currently. But no one really gives a shit.

 He enjoys getting off with his boyfriend, C418. The faggot who makes the ear-rape that he claims is &quot;music&quot;. On August 20, 2010. Notch realased his last godawful update (nothing more than a fence, and features that were not needed.

 He then preceded to shoot himself in the head. Because he &quot;couldn&#39;t stand being around mere mortals anymore&quot;. No one went to his funeral. Save for his wife (mom), and his friend  (secret lover) C418.
