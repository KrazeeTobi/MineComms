Well my sister is crazy, she has many mental problems and dissorders, and she has gotten our stuff, including my week old wii stolen from us 4 times already.
She is whoring around for whatever reason, using livelinks and craigslist to get guys to make money. Almost all of her friends are horrible people that do drugs and mostly are whores, she also does drugs.

I am on vacation right now in Pennsulvania, we locked my door with a padlock that has all the valuables in there so she can&#39;t take them to sell or have her other friends rob us again.

Anyways, I heard that she has had a lot of guys over the past week and I&#39;m worried. I don&#39;t have a backup of any of my shit and I just bought some more ram for my computer.
If it turns out that she broke into my room or any of the other guys did and my computer is destroyed/ripped apart or stolen, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do, I think I might kill her, literally."

Bananazorz is being a pretty Awesome guy and is lending his Mumble to my Minecraft server! 

[b]What is Mumble?[/b]
It&#39;s Like Teamspeak or Ventrillo, it allows you to talk to a group of people.

[b]How do I Download this amazing science?[/b]
Go here: [url]http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/files/Mumble/1.2.2/Mumble-1.2.2.exe/download[/url]

[b]How do I get into it?[/b]
Once you finish Downloading the Software and go through the introduction, click &quot;server&quot; on the tool bar, and then click on the &quot;connect&quot; button. Hit &quot;Add new...&quot; and type in this information: 
[code]Servername:The Mumbel
Address:viuhka.fi
Port:64718
Username:(whatever you want your username to be)[/code]
And thats it! You should be all set to chat :D

[highlight][b]NOTICE:[/b][/highlight]Do not use the &quot;Backwards compatible&quot; version it does not work with the server.[/QUOTE]


Is this like mumble in project reality, where you can only hear people who are nearby you? If so, I will love you forever."

Bananazorz is being a pretty Awesome guy and is lending his Mumble to my Minecraft server! 

[b]What is Mumble?[/b]
It&#39;s Like Teamspeak or Ventrillo, it allows you to talk to a group of people.

[b]How do I Download this amazing science?[/b]
Go here: [url]http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/files/Mumble/1.2.2/Mumble-1.2.2.exe/download[/url]

[b]How do I get into it?[/b]
Once you finish Downloading the Software and go through the introduction, click &quot;server&quot; on the tool bar, and then click on the &quot;connect&quot; button. Hit &quot;Add new...&quot; and type in this information: 
[code]Servername:The Mumbel
Address:viuhka.fi
Port:64718
Username:(whatever you want your username to be)[/code]
And thats it! You should be all set to chat :D

[highlight][b]NOTICE:[/b][/highlight]Do not use the &quot;Backwards compatible&quot; version it does not work with the server.[/QUOTE]


Is this like mumble in project reality, where you can only hear people who are nearby you? If so, I will love you forever.</span>

                        <postrender input="So let me talk about spelunking.

A while ago in Survival Singleplayer I discovered a cave system near my home base. It had a fair amount of iron and coal near the surface, so during the daytime I would saunter on over, mine what I could before darkness hit, and then head back. When the materials near the surface started to dry up, I figured I&#39;d take a plunge and map it all out. That didn&#39;t really work out for me.

First, I discovered that it was [i]massive[/i]. I started with 64 torches, and right now I believe I have somewhere around 300, lighting the portions of the cave I&#39;ve explored. I&#39;ve found several waterfalls, two of which reach the lava near the bottom of the map and a third which swept me into a dead-end cavern where I promptly died from fall damage. When I figured I couldn&#39;t explore any more, I decided to work on my own mine... which led me into [i]another[/i] portion of the cave I hadn&#39;t yet explored. I thought another opening in the surface a while away was a different cave, until I saw my own torches after exploring some more. The various mining tunnels I&#39;ve been digging haven&#39;t been helping matters.

Second, the monsters. Even in the passages I&#39;ve traveled most, I can hear the moans of zombies and skeletons and spiders. The passages are well lit, but there are so many unlit side passages and corridors that finding the source is an exercise in futility. I often end up accidentally digging into these passages, trying to make the cave a bit easier to explore, and often end up getting an arrow to the face. When I do have to go spelunking, I have to be careful to leave anything I don&#39;t want to lose, as surprise Creeper attacks have been the cause of most of my deaths.

And then, there&#39;s the gravel. A huge portion of the cave&#39;s makeup is gravel. I&#39;ve almost died several times because of it, usually following an ore vein and then being crushed. 

I don&#39;t have a screenshot at the moment, but the&#39;s this one huge, gaping cavern that made out of [i]nothing[/i] but gravel. I don&#39;t have a screenshot, but right now it&#39;s the only thing blocking me from exploring the cave further. It&#39;s big enough and dark enough that I can&#39;t see anything at all, save for a wide gravel bridge going deeper into the earth. With the seemingly ever-increasing monster spawns, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to get ambushed while crossing it, causing the whole thing to collapse, wasting the torches used and the fancy diamond pick I made with the only diamond I&#39;ve found to date. 

It&#39;s a very impressive spectacle. This game is awesome. :v:"

Oh, the really fucked thing is that my mom stopped smoking and has not been for 5 months now and because of what my sister is doing to her, she is now smoking more then ever.
Also, forgot to mention, she has a son and doesn&#39;t know how to treat him at all, me and my mom are watching him till she gets better ( never ) or when he gets of age."

They don&#39;t do shit, we already have many many times before.


Oh, the really fucked thing is that my mom stopped smoking and has not been for 5 months now and because of what my sister is doing to her, she is now smoking more then ever.
Also, forgot to mention, she has a son and doesn&#39;t know how to treat him at all, me and my mom are watching him till she gets better ( never ) or when he gets of age.</span>
