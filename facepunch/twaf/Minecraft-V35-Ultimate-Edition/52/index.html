Under a lot of stress? What from? Getting to talk to Valve? Stress from updates? I doubt it, he&#39;s made it very clear that he&#39;ll just stop doing them if he thinks he needs a break.

Wow, people who love Notch seem to have very mixed ideas about him. 

Many of you say he cares about fans and opinions. And many of you say he doesn&#39;t give a shit about his fans.

What none of you seem to understand is that Notch really doesn&#39;t give a shit whether you like his update or not so there&#39;s no sense complaining that you don&#39;t like fences and think there are more important things he could be doing. He works on his schedule, not yours. If something&#39;s broke, he&#39;ll fix it. Maybe he won&#39;t fix it right this minute in the next update, but he&#39;ll fix it, and that&#39;s reason enough to stop griping about things that are broken and just play the damn game how it is.[/QUOTE]

You continue to twist my words into a pretzel knot. I never said the fans don&#39;t want issues fixed, I said that Notch will fix the issues when [I]he[/I] gets to it instead of when the fans tell him to do it. Specifically, I said &quot;Notch does not care if you think he should have done X first and Y later&quot;, and I meant that exactly. The rest of the Minecraft Thread couldn&#39;t care less about what [I]you personally[/I] think Notch should be doing right now at this moment, he isn&#39;t going to take a coffee break from coding the game only when you tell him to.

You continue to twist my words into a pretzel knot. I never said the fans don&#39;t want issues fixed, I said that Notch will fix the issues when [I]he[/I] gets to it instead of when the fans tell him to do it. Specifically, I said &quot;Notch does not care if you think he should have done X first and Y later&quot;, and I meant that exactly. The rest of the Minecraft Thread couldn&#39;t care less about what [I]you personally[/I] think Notch should be doing right now at this moment, he isn&#39;t going to take a coffee break from coding the game only when you tell him to.
