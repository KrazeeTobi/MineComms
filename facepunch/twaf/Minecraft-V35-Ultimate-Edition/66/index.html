                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Destitide;24228047]I guess, when you get to that level, it&#39;s a simple few qiestopms: Do you like building things from blocks, and is it an original idea?

I like Minecraft because it adds a challenge to building with blocks. Because it is difficult to gain the materials to build with, it becomes far more rewarding to build large structures.</span>
