If anyone wants to do anything with it, feel free.

[code]Minecraft is a browser-based Java game developed by Markus Alexej Persson.

Minecraft is still in pre-BETA stages, essentially meaning it is no where near done. Until it reaches the Beta stage, it is 9.99 Euro. After that, it will double to become ~20 Euro. Currently, pre-ordering it has no benefits apart from Indev (IN DEVelopement) and Infdev (INFinite in DEVelopement).

Gameplay is praised for being so simple while still being addicting. What you do is, using building blocks of all sorts, build stuff. However, what you do in Minecraft varies greatly depending on which gamemode you are playing. Currently, there are 4 gamemodes - Creative SP/MP, Survival SP, Indev SP and Infdev SP.

[B][I]==Gameplay elements==[/I][/B]

[B]Crafting-[/B]
Available in: Indev, Infdev
Crafting is, like a lot of things in Minecraft, what you&#39;d think it would be. You take a few things, throw &#39;em together, and you get something new. Most things including tools require you to have a crafting table, which can be made using 4 plank blocks in the crafting menu, which can be opened by pressing the I key (by default).

[B]Farming-[/B]
Available in: Indev, Infdev
Farming is hard to explain, but I&#39;ll do my best. Basically, when you craft a hoe tool and till some grass, there&#39;s a chance that seeds will come out. You can plant seeds on tilled dirt and if they get enough light, they will eventually grow. You can tell they are fully grown when there are distinct brown tips on them, at which point you can destroy it to get some wheat and 1-3 seeds.

[B]Mining/Logging/Misc.[/B] Resource gathering
Available in: Indev, Infdev, Survival
You&#39;ll find yourself spending most of your time in Minecraft either Mining, or gathering resources in some other fashion. Be it cutting down some trees or digging yourself to China, you&#39;ll need some stuff to build whatever it is you&#39;re trying to.
The ores you can find while mining are as follows, in order from best to worst: Diamond, Iron, Cobblestone, Gold (Gold has the same capabilities with tools as Wooden tools, so it is recommended you don&#39;t use it for tools).

[B]Mobs-[/B]
Available in: Indev, Infdev, Survival
There are 4 types of mobs currently (more are planned). They only appear on difficulties above peaceful (so easy, medium and hard), and spawn in low-light. This means you have to tread carefully when exploring a new cave, as they could be lurking there.
--The Skeleton takes up a 1x1x2 area, and will shoot arrows at you from a distance. They drop 0 - 2 arrows upon death, and if sunlight makes contact with them, they will begin to burn and eventually die.
--Creepers. They take up a 1x1x2 area. You&#39;ve probably heard a pun involving &quot;sssSSSsss&quot;. Creepers are the source of that little joke. They are funny looking green creatures originally intended to be humans by Notch. However, he eventually decided he was not going to go through with that and made the Creepers we know today. When you get too close to a Creeper, they will stop moving and being to puff up. During this time, they will hiss&quot;ssSSss&quot;. After about 1 and a half seconds of this, they will explode, damaging you if you are too close. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you can trigger their explosion and escape in time. It is also fairly common to trigger their attack, move away from them and have them randomly stop attacking and chase you again. They drop 0 - 2 gunpowder upon killing them (they will not drop this if they die from their own explosion).
--Zombies. They take up a 1x1x2 area, and are simplest of the mobs. Put simply, if you get too close to them, they&#39;ll attack you. Upon death, they can randomly drop feathers. When they make contact with light, they catch fire and eventually die.
--Spiders. Taking up a 2x2x1 area, they are fairly similar to Zombies. However, taking up a 2x2x1 area means they can sometimes slip under your defenses if they are not carefully built. When killed, they can drop string. They are not aggressive during the day.

[B]Creatures-[/B]
Available in: Indev, Infdev, Survival
Creatures are the only other living things in the game besides mobs. However, they do not try to harm you (although they are still typically very, very annoying). They are typically found roaming in packs.
--Pigs. Weighing in at 1x2x1 area taken up, they are possibly the best thing to see in the game (besides Diamond). When killed, they drop 0 - 2 Pork, which heals 1 and a half hearts when eaten. If smelted, it turns into Grilled Pork, which heals 4 hearts when eaten.
--Sheep. They take up a 1x2x1 area. They have a &quot;shield&quot; of sorts, this being their wool. When you attack a sheep, it will lose it&#39;s wool coat and drop 1-3 wool blocks. Killing them does not yield any further drops.

[B]Health-[/B]
Available in: Indev, Infdev, Survival
Yeah, you can get hurt and even die in Minecraft. In Survival, you get a nice &quot;Game over&quot; message displaying your score and an option to generate another map for another go.. In Indev, you get a &quot;Game over&quot; message as well as an option to load another Indev save. In Infdev, you get an option to return to the title screen or respawn. Respawning takes you to the very first spawnpoint you were at when you generated the map.
You can give yourself a &quot;health bonus&quot; of sorts by crafting armor. See the crafting guide for more details. To restore health, you need food - this includes Pork, Mushroom soup (again, consult the crafting guide), and bread (3 wheat crafted together). Right click while holding food to have it heal you (it will disappear).

[B][I]==Gamemodes==[/I][/B]

[B]Creative SP/MP-[/B]
In Creative Mode, you have one goal - build stuff. You have infinite resources of every building tool in the game so far at your disposal. The rule of thumb in Creative mode is that your imagination is the limit.

[B]Survival SP-[/B]
Exactly what you&#39;d think. Survive. You start out with nothing and must gather resources to eventually build up a defense while also killing mobs to gain points. This is believed to be the first (besides Creative) gamemode that will reach Multiplayer.

[B]Indev SP-[/B]
Despite the name, Indev is not actually in developement right now. It will be replaced soon by Infdev, however there will be an option to limit the size of the map you generate. In Indev, things are lot like Survival, however the gameplay is actually much, much different. There are added gameplay elements such as crafting, farming and smelting.

[B]Infdev SP-[/B]
Infdev. Quite possibly Minecraft&#39;s most popular and greatest gamemode. Infdev is pretty much the exact same thing as Indev - however, there is no limit to the size of the map. Well, there is - the size of your hard drive. Infdev will soon replace Indev with added options to limit the size of your map.
