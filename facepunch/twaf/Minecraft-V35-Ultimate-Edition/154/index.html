[highlight]Before anyone asks[/highlight], the texture pack I am using is [url=http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=25676]dokus&#39; RPG texture pack[/url], Teacarp is going to be posting some screenshots (probably less than what I have) with the vanilla texture pack later on. I am even interested to see these myself. 

This was all done over a few hours (some of yesterday and some of today).

[b]The Rapture[/b]: We never established a true name for this, except overall it was greatly inspired by Bioshock&#39;s underwater city, the Rapture. So as a result, we have always referred to it as the Rapture. In creating this, it was very difficult for obvious reasons (being underwater). We tried to make it very private and also difficult to get into, whilst maintaining an aesthetically pleasing appearance. I think the execution of this was done well, there is only 2 ways (excluding destroying the walls of stacking blocks) which are both very hidden, and one involves a huge tunnel which the entrance a long way away. There are several secrets within this too.

For the sake of not stretching the page too much, I will thumb these. They&#39;re in jpg format and 1920 x 1080 resolution, so you can decide whether you want to view them in their full size. 

This is the entrance. To get in, you have to find a 1x1 opening, swim down and the forward. It is very hard to locate from the surface, and while not perfect in how it was made it certainly is sufficient in keeping unwanted visitors out.

This is a screenshot from the roof of the tower. Nothing much really. The tower in the distance contains the storage and the large abyss (see a few screenshots below).
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/W6GVl.jpg[/img_thumb]

The reeds room. This (unlike the crops room) has had a lot of attention paid to it due to the motivation of the library needing to be completed. 
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/kwzMJ.jpg[/img_thumb]

This is the crops room. Being multiplayer we have had very little motivation to do anything other than simply plant 2 plants in there (courtesy of Crivens McJugs!).
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/CmExf.jpg[/img_thumb]

Our library, not 100% complete yet but it is pretty close. 
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/SxOjJ.jpg[/img_thumb]

This is our storage, it is several stories high and has [b]a lot[/b] of sand, wood, clay, iron blocks etc. There is plenty of space, which we utilize as much as possible. 
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/yYsQA.jpg[/img_thumb]

This is a large, open abyss. Originally a mine, but then we mined all the stone out of it for building purposes. Since being completely mind, it has become nothing other than an abyss. If we choose to, we could expand our storage into it because it is located directly under it, but as of now it is virtually pointless.
[IMG_thumb]http://imgur.com/HDgbp.jpg[/IMG_thumb]

This is just a bit of a lobby thing. It has a window on the roof, and a fireplace just to [i]making it a bit more interesting[/i].
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/p6O4i.jpg[/img_thumb]

The cobble stone generator, anyone who has plays minecraft should be able to work out how it works.

Crafting and smelting room, again self explanatory.

This is just a long distance shot. Unfortunately, it was difficult to capture the full essence of the rapture with full immersion but we certainly did our best.
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/cKkY3.jpg[/img_thumb]

A room with a tree in it. I think it looks sweet personally.

This is just looking down into the tree room.

[b]The Phasos Lighthouse[/b]: We based this lighthouse as best we could as the lighthouse in [url=http://www.foreign-independent-tours.com/images/tourdetails/PharosLightHouse.jpg]this image[/url], while not perfect and lacking the wall around it, and some window rows (that was mainly due to laziness (let me add every piece of smooth stone was cobble stone smelted down! This was a long and arduous process, and consisted of several hundred stones)). While not perfect, we are all very proud of the end result. This is linked up through a secret tunnel to the Rapture city, where this tunnel is I cannot say due to some people who play on the server might read here. It should also be noted that this building is not 100% complete.

First of all, this is a long shot of the building in day. As you can see, it is the full lighthouse except at this time of day, the actual light has very little effect. You can also see how big this thing is! 
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/zOX2X.jpg[/img_thumb]

This is a close-up of the building. 
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/O4kpM.jpg[/img_thumb]

The interior of the lighthouse. This is still a WIP, we have plans to put a water fountain in the centre and various other things.
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/2Gyz4.jpg[/img_thumb]

This is a long shot of the lighthouse at night. As you can see, it is fully lit and looking fantastic. 
[img_thumb]http://imgur.com/KOaN9.jpg[/img_thumb]

Overall, we&#39;re proud of our creation. We have not [i]cheated[/i] for anything, though to get the grass in the rapture screenshots we did ask an administrator to spawn us 2 grass blocks (for the 2 separate towers).

I probably should also mention, we plan on making a small village accompany the lighthouse on the coast."

This is just looking down into the tree room.

[b]The Phasos Lighthouse[/b]: We based this lighthouse as best we could as the lighthouse in [url=http://www.foreign-independent-tours.com/images/tourdetails/PharosLightHouse.jpg]this image[/url], while not perfect and lacking the wall around it, and some window rows (that was mainly due to laziness (let me add every piece of smooth stone was cobble stone smelted down! This was a long and arduous process, and consisted of several hundred stones)). While not perfect, we are all very proud of the end result. This is linked up through a secret tunnel to the Rapture city, where this tunnel is I cannot say due to some people who play on the server might read here. It should also be noted that this building is not 100% complete.

First of all, this is a long shot of the building in day. As you can see, it is the full lighthouse except at this time of day, the actual light has very little effect. You can also see how big this thing is!

This is a close-up of the building.

The interior of the lighthouse. This is still a WIP, we have plans to put a water fountain in the centre and various other things.

This is a long shot of the lighthouse at night. As you can see, it is fully lit and looking fantastic.

Overall, we&#39;re proud of our creation. We have not [i]cheated[/i] for anything, though to get the grass in the rapture screenshots we did ask an administrator to spawn us 2 grass blocks (for the 2 separate towers).

I probably should also mention, we plan on making a small village accompany the lighthouse on the coast.</span>
