[editline]12th March 2011[/editline]

Now onto MC. I seem to have found myself in a bit of trouble. I have no worlds. Everytime I start a world and try to be legit. I stop being legit for the sake of doing crazy shit. Like using GraviTNT and the sort. Even on my server I often neglect my powers to cheat my way into building something.[/QUOTE]
 
Same here, it ruins the gameplay, but in the longrun i&#39;m too lazy to get stacks of stone (at least in singleplayer).</span>

I was asking about your reasoning, you gave none, doesn&#39;t matter if it was an hour ban, I was asking why it was a ban, not why it was an hour ban.  But either way you&#39;re too proud to respond to any of that.



On topic because this is getting us nowhere, a chunk with everything but ore cleared out.
