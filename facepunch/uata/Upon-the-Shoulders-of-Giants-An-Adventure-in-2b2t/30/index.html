So, C-NGF was a wonderful military camp and bam, when you logged off Glent decided that his butt buddy Protocol7 and Glent would completely turn on us and destroy the camp, steal the resources, and leave us at spawn.

 I had no idea Glent would do this as it was completely random. He even built a little animal spawning room, which would have taken a bit of effort.

 I guess his gain was much better though, seeing as he had stolen the full set of diamond armor and 32 diamonds that I had on me while I was trying run away. The armor wasn&#39;t actually on me. It was already nearly gone by that time. I just exchanged it for iron armor.

They are both users. (They date me at that) I thought he wouldn&#39;t fuck shit up and he was trustworthy for being here from 2008 and lower.

So, that means that rule #1, #2, and #5 were broken.

You need to remove C-NGF from the camp list too."

Seeing as he told me that if I stayed in my fort outside of his base, he would kill me, I moved my base just outside the area where you can see peoples names through walls. I made a new base and when I logged, I logged off in a hole in the wall just to be safe. When I log back in and break out of my hole, there&#39;s a lava flow right on top of my fucking bed. It had to be an FPer from Startoads base because they&#39;re the only ones who give a shit enough to go out that far. I know it wasn&#39;t a raider, because they left my sugarcane crop untouched.

                            <span v-pre>I assume StarToad, or someone from his base, tried to kill me in my sleep. Seeing as he told me that if I stayed in my fort outside of his base, he would kill me, I moved my base just outside the area where you can see peoples names through walls. I made a new base and when I logged, I logged off in a hole in the wall just to be safe. When I log back in and break out of my hole, there&#39;s a lava flow right on top of my fucking bed. It had to be an FPer from Startoads base because they&#39;re the only ones who give a shit enough to go out that far. I know it wasn&#39;t a raider, because they left my sugarcane crop untouched.
[QUOTE=That Ninja;29579760]Coordinates for FP safe haven? I kept wandering between ruins, until I got surprise creeper bombed. It was dark out and it was raining, so I didn&#39;t notice these two players in full diamond approach me. I, stupidly, thought they would help me fight off everything, but they killed me.
I&#39;d [i]really[/i] appreciate some coordinates.[/QUOTE]
You&#39;re like the third person to talk about them. Any idea who they are?</span>
