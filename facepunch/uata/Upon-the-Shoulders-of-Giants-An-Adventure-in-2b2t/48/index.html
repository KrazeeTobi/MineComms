I&#39;d like to apply for a spot in the bombing the fuck out of your fucking shitty jew buildings, you can&#39;t even trust yourselves that&#39;s how shitty you are.

You can&#39;t even begin to fathom how hard your buildings will be raped, molested and burned, when I&#39;m finished with you all you&#39;ll be crying for more, because deep down you like being stepped upon by superior men. Fucking worthless Niggers.

I think the issue is with the number of people online and how spread out they are. I&#39;ve noticed on New Ventlegille that if I&#39;m the only person online, the mob tower there produces like crazy.

I was the first one to that area.

Then my psycho friend comes to the server (the one that tried to murder me and failed) so I dropped everything there and legged it to spawn.

Makes me regret not staying, so many facepunchers have stumbled across that area. So, if you find a nice valley with a wooden house with red and white wool carpet inside, it was constructed by me."

                            <span v-pre>While I was going on my journey from my old base about 30k out, to closer to spawn because I was bored of being a hermit, I found this amazing base. After talking with mweorz, he said that he was responsible for the damage to it. Obviously built with hacks before the server had its bukkit plugin installed. (I think?) (Yes I use more info mod - no I don&#39;t care. I like it)

[quote]Leave now, beware the claw. Watch your step[/quote]

Traveling north....spawns a mere images of what it used to be. The proud towers that once stood watch over the region now lay in ruins as I continue my journey. Day becomes night in almost an instant. Left with only my two fists, a clump of dirt and the feet that brought me here, I continue my travels north in the rain, snow, and the barren seas that keep me from civilization. 

I run into various camps of which are now abandoned. The dying flames of their torches and storage boxes with nothing but sand. Pilfered to oblivion with no signs of life, except for the moans of the dead and the clitter clatter of the skeletons over yonder, I eventually I lose all hope as I move on. With only good faith left in my mind I stumble across an elegant castle, slowly crumbling away over time I walk over to what remains of the entrance. There I see a vast field of flowers with signs and a work bench. I&#39;m assuming the last people to visit this area were riddled with more questions then I was. I set camp for the night with the hopes of being able to sleep for the night. The dim lights of the castle flames keep me at ease, but the sound of the rain dropping against the walls don&#39;t make me feel the slightest bit welcome.

/pictures whenever I can figure out where the hell minecraft saves them too. I wish to remain seperate from the confederacy. In the hopes that my adventure will lead me to riches beyond my wildest dreams.

I wake up to the sounds of nearby animals, mainly cows and chickens for now. The sun is out and I don&#39;t see a hint of rain coming in for a while. I&#39;ve checked to make sure I left nothing behind.....

Day Two begins.

Continuing my travels in search of civilization, or at least somewhere that doesn&#39;t remind me of the wasteland we call a spawn point. I think I&#39;ve finally reached the outskirts of town, glorious trees everywhere! It&#39;s like a dream come true. I spent most of my day constructing tools to continue chopping wood. Eventually I ended up with a big haul that took up most of the space I had. Unfortunately, I had to make sacrifices and leave behind some things. But no matter, it will be worth it in the end.

/sometime later.

Eventually I walk through vast fields of trees and giant bodies of water. I start to see structures in the distance. As I approach closer I notice that they are man made, signs that someone was previously here. I feel somewhat glad that I am going somewhere that people are at. However, something disturbs me as the thought of these people being madmen starts to creep it&#39;s way slowly into my mind. After various landmarks I notice a door of some sort on a small island. I progressed forward into the door and see a giant gaping crater in the ground. 

It was best to rest up before continuing onward.

However, something disturbs me as the thought of these people being madmen starts to creep it&#39;s way slowly into my mind. After various landmarks I notice a door of some sort on a small island. I progressed forward into the door and see a giant gaping crater in the ground.

I wake up to the sounds of nearby animals, mainly cows and chickens for now. The sun is out and I don&#39;t see a hint of rain coming in for a while. I&#39;ve checked to make sure I left nothing behind.....

Day Two begins.

Continuing my travels in search of civilization, or at least somewhere that doesn&#39;t remind me of the wasteland we call a spawn point. I think I&#39;ve finally reached the outskirts of town, glorious trees everywhere! It&#39;s like a dream come true. I spent most of my day constructing tools to continue chopping wood. Eventually I ended up with a big haul that took up most of the space I had. Unfortunately, I had to make sacrifices and leave behind some things. But no matter, it will be worth it in the end.

/sometime later.

Eventually I walk through vast fields of trees and giant bodies of water. I start to see structures in the distance.

Day 3 : 

Waking up from a brief nightmare, I realize that I fell asleep in the corner of the crater. I can&#39;t tell exactly what time it is but the moon over my head tells me it&#39;s not yet time for me to be wandering around. Ignoring any warnings my senses were telling me, I regained my composure and looked around. It was then I noticed a small passage in the corner of the crater, with a light emitting from the insides. I slowly advanced forward to the passageway, ready for what lays ahead. 

I took a step and saw a long hallway, longer then the eye could see. Although it may have been light at the entrance, the deeper I looked into that hall made me feel as if the it were the void in there. I had nothing left to lose so I packed up what I could and hid the rest of my belongings in a ditch near by. I had covered the pathway with some sand and dirt to make sure nobody would know this was here, at the most I want to make sure that nothing else would come in after me....in the event I might not be able to come back. 

I wander the halls aimlessly in a straight line. The feeling of paranoia finally pries into my mind as the seemingly increasing humming noise became louder and louder. The deeper I proceeded into those halls the more darker it became. It eventually became a game of who can keep touching the walls. The darkness may have been the only thing keeping me from losing my sanity...until I took a fall for the worse.

I had fallen a long height down. I noticed I took quite a bit of damage, holding on to the last remaining bits of my working heart felt like holding sand between my fingers. The darkness vanished as quick as the fall, and eventually I was engulfed in light once more. After figuring out where I had fallen, I see a series of caves, tunnels and giant ladders with chests around me. It seems someone had already been here....and the torches were still fresh. The smell of fresh ocean water lingered in the air, assuming there was a near by water source I&#39;d have to say I might be in luck.

The cave was the least of my problems now. The fall had taken quite a toll on me and the height to get back up was just too much for me to handle. At least in my current condition. I browsed through the treasure chests and picked up what little materials left. A rusty sword, a shovel and a pick axe. A few apples and a piece of leather armor. I couldn&#39;t say I felt the least bit safe, but at this point in my life with only a sword and pick axe....made me feel more empowered then usual. It could have been the bump on the head, or I could have been feeling the rush that I was looking for.

Spending hours in that cave, I noticed things that could change a man. Even if the air smelled like fresh ocean water, nothing could prepare you for what lays deeper ahead. The bodies of men everywhere, the smell of decomposing flesh and weapons all over the floor. Some of which looked like normal explorers, while some were guards of some sort. It feels as if I learned just a bit about what happened at that castle. 

Seconds turned into minutes, and minutes turned into hours.

Those hours turned into an eternity.

Every time I close my eyes, I hear nothing but screams in this cave. 

I haven&#39;t slept for days, and god knows how long it&#39;s been since I entered this place.

Soon....I went deeper. I lacked the energy, motivation and mental awareness. 

It got hotter all of a sudden, red and my body felt heavy. I stumbled across a cavern of some sort which ran near a pool of lava. Almost a never ending path of lava. Those steps carefully taken, one by one.

Eventually that one step would take my life. I never saw the light of day again, just the burning sensation of the lava killing me from the waist up. Eventually, all the pain turned to nothing. And the only thing I could feel was my hand reaching for something from the pool of lava.
