Christ, I found out some other guy had set up camp like 50 blocks away from me. I regret doing it, but I destroyed his bed. Didn&#39;t take anything though, but I just felt he was too close to me :tinfoil:[/QUOTE]

He can still spawn at the place he logged off though, he remakes his bed and gets revenge on you. You should flood his entire base with lava just to be sure. Cause you certainly haven&#39;t made a friend.</span>

Found this during my nomadic travels. It was awesome and had a good supply of farm animals. Spent some time there for a while. Sometimes these war-torn hulking colossi of buildings can be useful sometimes.

Here&#39;s something I set up for any wandering miner. A nice, warm, inviting building. No traps.

There&#39;s a chest inside. And a nice checkered floor.

Sweet l00t. Hope someone finds this.

By the way, which camps need some help? I&#39;d be more than willing to lend a hand in laboring.[/QUOTE]
