DON&#39;T FUCKING DETONATE TNT IN THE BASE YOU OVERWEIGHT CONKSUNK[/QUOTE]
 
Remind me never to come within 200 blocks of your base. I have a habit of setting off TNT with stray redstone wiring I didn&#39;t notice. I blew a hole from bedrock to ocean level 100 blocks across on single player. I made a machine to push the 12 row of TNT from my duplicator glitch machine into more rows for storage and easy pick up for later. The stack got so big it ran into an active redstone wire from another prject and shit hit the fan :v"

                        <postrender input="So here&#39;s how this glorified story goes.

Me and my friend, Exodus, decide to join this server and see what it&#39;s like. After getting a good look of the spawn and seeing some guys with diamond equipment, we flee in attempt to not get murdered right off the bat. We go in a diagonal direction in hope of starting a nice colony where our other friends may happily join us in. But we ended up stuck in some shelter with a massive staircase in front of it (due to the accursed day and night cycle), so we decide to enter a very miniscule tunnel dug out in on the side of the stairs.
We venture through the small encasing of the tunnel and come along a small rest area that expands directly into a cave, with the possibility of creatures luring in and defeating us. But what do you know - a skeleton managed to crawl out from the very edges of the cave obstructed by the dark. Exodus thought it would be a grand idea to take on the skeleton to successfully protect us, which in return resulted in him being completely obliterated by said enemy. I panic and flee to the back of the lobby that we used as a resting place from anything that can be classified as dangerous (hint: EVERYTHING). Luckily, nothing ever dared to come towards me, so I use this as an advantage and journey more into the tunnel while I wait for my friend to come back.
But at this time, my other friend, Alec, decided to join roughly near the same time Exodus respawned. The two of them partnered up some time later and were originally going to come save my ass, as I managed to get lost in the deep pits of Buttfuck, Nowhere right underneath the spawn. Eventually I was able to crawl out of what seemed to be a loose vagina and hide in the ruins of a cobblestone shack. I flip the F3 switch and tell my comrades the location of my current position, which I then proceed to idle. Alec was able to appear in a minutes notice, and a split second later I see a fellow Exodus enter my view. Once Exodus was close enough, he decided to tell me about his adventure with Alec and how he was able to gather a large surplus of supplies, very useful ones too. After all this commotion, we check our surroundings, clear our tracks, and head off to what could possibly be the greatest thing I&#39;ve ever done (hint: it&#39;s not).
We travel a vast distance and surprisingly come across a few trees that weren&#39;t entirely destroyed, having very little logs left, yet were enough to construct us a few, useful materials and supplies. And then it hits us - nightfall. We struggle to find a proper home, until I start randomly digging into an open pit. But as I break dirt block after dirt block, light manages to emerge from the wall as I break open an entrance into an old, abandoned home. Me, Exodus, and Alec decided to venture around the run-down building, scavenging for anything useful. Sadly, nothing was of use besides the torches stuck to the walls in various places, most of them being very obscure. We head back to the lobby (or in this case, the area in which we broke into originally) when I so happen to look upwards and notice two figures above us, one with the most horrendous skin, I nearly had a stroke. I scream, and Exodus wonders what I was screaming at. He noticed my head looking upwards this entire time, and does the same.
Needless to say, Alec also joined, and in unison we screamed and began to run, scattering in different directions in hopes of confusing these people. But alas, our tricks were too good for these old dogs and they managed to kill me and Exodus. On the other hand, I first thought that Alec was also doomed, but he never came back. Apparently, they kept him as a &#39;toy&#39;, or just to torture him. They trapped him into a small encasing, where he eventually fell into an open hole. The men chased after him and of course, tore him apart vigorously with their diamond swords.
At this point, the last man of the group joined us in our adventure, who was called by the name Romet. Now here we all are, dead midnight, at spawn, with nothing to do. We entertain ourselves by jumping about like retards near some lava to pass time. Exodus manages to fall into a small crevice (apparently he was pushed by Alec, but I beg to differ) where he later falls into lava. At this point, the sun starts to arrive over the destroyed hills of the server and all four of us decide to start our exodus (heh get it) right in the different direction of where we originally went.
We went through a few hardships, such as going across strong currents and through broken down homes with lava flooding the entire floor of said homes. We travel incredibly far, and yet most of the land it taken by a multitude of players. After many long minutes of traveling through the terrain, night is just around the corner, and we decide to make a small camp inside a mountain. We dig around, gather some nice supplies, and Exodus was able to obtain a wolf through all of this process. As night passed we slowly began to decrease our mining time until the sun broke over the horizon. We gathered all of our necessary belongings and head back out for a place to settle a nice home. As we come over a jagged landscape, we notice a grand castle with a large amount of variety - from lava moats to brilliant outposts, used for what I would assume for guarding the outer walls of the beauty. We enter through the front door one by one, and look at all the features this magnificent building has to offer. As I enter the building last, I take a quick glance to my right, where my heart nearly skips a beat.





Those bastards from before were right there.

I couldn&#39;t believe it. They were following us this whole time, and now the have managed to catch up to us on the spot (probably gave them quite a bit of time after resting in the mountain side). I, again, scream in surprise and frantically tell my fellow members of the group of our predicament. They all begin to freak out just like I did, and before you know it, we&#39;re all scattering again, just like before.
I believe this is how the fight went; they chased us around the maze-like castle a tad, trying to get at least a single jab into us with their diamond swords. They managed to take down our beloved Romet before any of us, and soon I found myself being chased by the scary figure I saw above me from earlier. I was wishing they would just leave, and for some reason they turn back and chase after Exodus and Alec, whom were going in a different direction entirely. I cross a few islands and quickly decide to build an incredibly small hut in the ground and stealth myself, to prevent my location from being revealed to the men if they so happened to follow my tracks. I pondered about running away from the area, as it was way to dangerous to stay, but at the same time, it was very dangerous to leave my current residence. I told my friends the coordinates (Exodus and Alec shortly died after us being departed), but when they heard the sad news of me being 1,200 away from the spawn, their ability to play more deeply decreased. Shortly after hearing their response, I took a break while they enjoyed themselves a bit and entered the Nether.

Moral of the story: You&#39;re gonna get butt-fucked no matter what you do, so have fun.

They managed to take down our beloved Romet before any of us, and soon I found myself being chased by the scary figure I saw above me from earlier. I was wishing they would just leave, and for some reason they turn back and chase after Exodus and Alec, whom were going in a different direction entirely. I cross a few islands and quickly decide to build an incredibly small hut in the ground and stealth myself, to prevent my location from being revealed to the men if they so happened to follow my tracks. I pondered about running away from the area, as it was way to dangerous to stay, but at the same time, it was very dangerous to leave my current residence. I told my friends the coordinates (Exodus and Alec shortly died after us being departed), but when they heard the sad news of me being 1,200 away from the spawn, their ability to play more deeply decreased. Shortly after hearing their response, I took a break while they enjoyed themselves a bit and entered the Nether.

Moral of the story: You&#39;re gonna get butt-fucked no matter what you do, so have fun.
