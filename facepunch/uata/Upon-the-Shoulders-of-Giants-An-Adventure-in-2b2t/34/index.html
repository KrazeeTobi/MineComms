No no, you don&#39;t understand. I had a goal. A [I]vision.[/I]
This base was going to be sealed up and never opened again, with an underground tree farm providing wood for more tools to fuel the growth of an expansive mining system. It would&#39;ve remained completely invisible to the un-aided eye, people could&#39;ve swam/boated right over it and never seen it without hacks.
And just because I herp&#39;d the derp and didn&#39;t make a make-shift bed and shelter, that vision is gone.

And I&#39;m not taking this game seriously, it&#39;s just that after spending all that time walking just to get there, only to die because I made a dumb mistake I&#39;m just kinda &quot;nope&quot; about the whole thing. :v:"

He&#39;s getting all that TNT legitimately, and the only way to stop it is to find his fort and destroy the spawner, with TNT and lava afterwards. Possibly.
