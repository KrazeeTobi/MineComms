if you limit workbenches to admin-only you can get people close together in a city, which is a reasonable enough way to limit people to an area. but why would two cities want to kill each other? you could introduce an artificial shortage of materials but you would need to be in control of something that is rare enough that you can ration without being fucking annoying but still useful enough that everyone would be concerned about it

Yeah I can&#39;t find anything wrong with it. Sorry, I can&#39;t help you.

In other news:

[quote=Reddit]
    [b]Height limit are being experimented with in terms of expansion,[/b] either by limiting the world in the x-z direction (to keep memory low) or by introducing dynamic chunks which would rebuild the chunk to a higher one if you broke the 128 limit.
    Dragons? ... maybe. In either case you wont be able to ride them, and even if you could it would be in walking speed.
    [b]No flying machines[/b] because servers wont be able to keep up with chunk generation.
    Dynamic torches probably wont be added because of SMP performance.
    NPC&#39;s are in the works.
    No plan for vast oceans.
    Translucent glass too complicated.
    New tools using diamond is planned
    [b]Will stay on Java[/b] and they don&#39;t feel limited by it in terms of features, but memory control would be much better in C++
    Mojang got 6 programmers and a [b]german[/b].
    [b]Animals will spawn with chunks generation and will not respawn, meaning if you kill them are they gone for good, herding was mentioned but not specified[/b]
    Still unresolved if alpha pre-purchasers will get the xbox version for free.
    Will &quot;add some kind of meaning&quot; for those who want adventure
    [b]&quot;Endgame challenges&quot; inspired by terraria.[/b]
    [b]No more redstone wiring components, like the redstone repeater, will be added.[/b]
    Achievements are there because notch like them!
    Will add new drops to zombies.
    Critical hits, doubledamage if you jump-attack, to be added
    No more new weapons.
    Competitive gamemodes like capture the flag not high priority.
    Bow to have fixed attack speed.
    Jeb loves SC2!
    No more highly dynamic blocks, 1-block-movements at most.

Yeah I can&#39;t find anything wrong with it. Sorry, I can&#39;t help you.

In other news:

[quote=Reddit]
    [b]Height limit are being experimented with in terms of expansion,[/b] either by limiting the world in the x-z direction (to keep memory low) or by introducing dynamic chunks which would rebuild the chunk to a higher one if you broke the 128 limit.
    Dragons? ... maybe. In either case you wont be able to ride them, and even if you could it would be in walking speed.
    [b]No flying machines[/b] because servers wont be able to keep up with chunk generation.
    Dynamic torches probably wont be added because of SMP performance.
    NPC&#39;s are in the works.
    No plan for vast oceans.
    Translucent glass too complicated.
    New tools using diamond is planned
    [b]Will stay on Java[/b] and they don&#39;t feel limited by it in terms of features, but memory control would be much better in C++
    Mojang got 6 programmers and a [b]german[/b].
    [b]Animals will spawn with chunks generation and will not respawn, meaning if you kill them are they gone for good, herding was mentioned but not specified[/b]
    Still unresolved if alpha pre-purchasers will get the xbox version for free.
    Will &quot;add some kind of meaning&quot; for those who want adventure
    [b]&quot;Endgame challenges&quot; inspired by terraria.[/b]
    [b]No more redstone wiring components, like the redstone repeater, will be added.[/b]
    Achievements are there because notch like them!
    Will add new drops to zombies.
    Critical hits, doubledamage if you jump-attack, to be added
    No more new weapons.
    Competitive gamemodes like capture the flag not high priority.
    Bow to have fixed attack speed.
    Jeb loves SC2!
    No more highly dynamic blocks, 1-block-movements at most.
    [b]&quot;Definite possibility that we will add magic&quot;.[b]
    xbox version will have Kinect support.
   [b] Mobile version will require Android 2.3 or higher, but they are working on making 2.1+[/b]

    Biome specific resources possibly to be added.
