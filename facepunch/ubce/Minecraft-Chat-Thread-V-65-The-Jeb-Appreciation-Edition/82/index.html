Oh, right!
Would you guys like to see Creative [I]and[/I] Survival gameplay on the same server?
I could make it work through a plugin, and you&#39;d choose which gameplay you&#39;d like to play on. If people so desire, we could also say that some cities are survival or creative cities, give areas (one side of the map is creative the other is survival) or whatever.

[B]What is it?[/B]
Great question you fine looking specimen, The Ventle Pit Project is an attempt by Inacio and myself to design a server based around what Facepunch wants! We&#39;re going to try to use our previous server admining expertise along with contribution and ideas form Facepunch members in order to make the server that the people will want. Sounds like a great idea right? One problem:

[IMG]http://i224.photobucket.com/albums/dd140/johnlmonkey/vpproject2.png?t=1309921524[/IMG]

[B]That sucks! How can I help?[/B]
Well thats simple you dashing rogue! We need two things from Facepunch:

[B]1:[/B] We need ideas! What do [B]you[/B] want to see in a MC server? Would you like a whitelist? Should it be creative, survival, or something completely different? What plugins would you like?

[B]2:[/B] We need some donations. With Brohoster going down the tubes servers aren&#39;t as cheap. We need a little dosh from the people of facepunch in order to get this project together. Even the smallest donation works!

[B]Well this sounds like a fine project but why should I donate?[/B]

Because you&#39;ll get the benefit of always having a good server to go to, populated by the good people of Facepunch and managed by two people who have admined for some of the best Facepunch-Minecraft servers, and of course we&#39;ll come up with some goodies for donators.

[B]But Im a furry/pony/neonazi/etc. can I join?[/B]
So long as you have a Facepunch account we&#39;ll whitelist you. Just dont be a dick and keep any controversial stuff off the server.

[B]So gents, what do you think?[/B][/QUOTE]

I suggest a lottery to raise money for this server.

Also, I would have said creative but profan&#39;s server does it very well.

RP is boring as hell

Survival is only meh

What about... PIRATES?"

Indev brings back so many amazing memories, especially of the time I streamed myself while people read terrible Fanfics. Those were the days.

Too bad Livestream deleted the fucking videos without saying a word, I wish I could&#39;ve downloaded them before the incident.[/QUOTE]

I remember those days... Floating islands, hell, and the community was actually a tight-knit group of people chilling in a single thread.

Indev brings back so many amazing memories, especially of the time I streamed myself while people read terrible Fanfics. Those were the days.

Too bad Livestream deleted the fucking videos without saying a word, I wish I could&#39;ve downloaded them before the incident.[/QUOTE]

I remember those days... Floating islands, hell, and the community was actually a tight-knit group of people chilling in a single thread.

You should start up a livestream with just plain old survival, or maybe yogsbox.</span>

Oh, right!
Would you guys like to see Creative [I]and[/I] Survival gameplay on the same server?
I could make it work through a plugin, and you&#39;d choose which gameplay you&#39;d like to play on. If people so desire, we could also say that some cities are survival or creative cities, give areas (one side of the map is creative the other is survival) or whatever.

Every dollar you donate gets your name entered once (ex you donate $1 your name is entered one time, you donate $5 your name is entered 5 times). Once we&#39;ve raised enough money we&#39;ll enter all the names into random.org and pick 3 winners. Each winner will get the choice from 3 prizes.

The winner can pick either:

A: A custom title for them in the server as well as the spawn town named in their honor.

B: My sexy green drill hat in TF

All the other donators that dont win will get a slightly less sexy non custom title that says &quot;Donator&quot; in green. 

C: My equally sexy purple bandana named &quot;The Fat Man&#39;s Fabulous Frippery&quot; with the description &quot;It costs $400,000 to be this fabulous for 12 seconds.&quot;
