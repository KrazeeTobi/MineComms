Got the feet done, now to move upwards.

One leg down, one more to go!

Now it&#39;s time to build his torso.
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/XFakR.png[/IMG]
Done... Well at least about half of it, and the left pair of claws for the hell of it!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/nGsWk.png[/IMG]
&#39;Kay. Legs are done!

Now let&#39;s give this fella some arms, how else can he get a grip on his opponent (READ: Mate)?
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7cMpN.png[/IMG]
Aaaaaaaaand done!

Here&#39;s a comparison of him against my other two creations, absolutely massive!
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/M9icK.png[/IMG]
He&#39;s so big he&#39;s too big for the world, I didn&#39;t expect him to hit the non-existential ceiling.

An orange slime, some sort of a humanoid, a glowing tree, and a floor that has the same properties as dirt.

I decided to approach the tree, it seemed like it had the same properties as a regular tree except that it was glowing, I decided to name it glowood and the floor would be named netherdirt.

I took some of the wood, and made a crafting table out of it

Using the resources that are in my possession, I had created a glowood pick and an axe.

As I was minding my own business exploring the area a bit more I was ambushed by what seemed like a native of the nether, it was an archer.

His arrow had grazed my head
so I had no choice but to defend myself and take him on, I was victorious and the native had dropped what seemed like a white apple, possibly an apple that had grew on glowood.

Mere seconds after, more natives had charged me, taking an offensive stance I defeated all of them, they had orange slimes with them, one of the deceased natives had dropped his sword, so I took it.

As I was minding my own business exploring the area a bit more I was ambushed by what seemed like a native of the nether, it was an archer.

His arrow had grazed my head
so I had no choice but to defend myself and take him on, I was victorious and the native had dropped what seemed like a white apple, possibly an apple that had grew on glowood.

[editline]10th July 2011[/editline]

Mere seconds after, more natives had charged me, taking an offensive stance I defeated all of them, they had orange slimes with them, one of the deceased natives had dropped his sword, so I took it.

[IMG]http://horobox.co.uk/u/RaptorRed_1310386050.png[/IMG]

The sword is apparently forged from a mineral known as &quot;Neridium&quot;.[/QUOTE]

I am not doing that which I am doing for the sake of attention, I am not attempting to steal your thunder, nor is it my intention, It is not up to me whether people are interested more in my screenshots than yours or vice versa, by saying that you are basically telling me to stop posting because it is diverting the attention from your creation to me.
