Beautiful.

And then the server had restarted and I can&#39;t play it anymore due to lags and timeouts, mostly client-sided, how disappointing.</span>

Sure, for bigger servers/public ones it&#39;s dumb to use Hamachi, but for him and his cousin? It&#39;s fine. And he can use that same network to play other games with him too.[/QUOTE]

I tried forwarding ports but it didn&#39;t work, so I took the easy option. I&#39;ve used it before and it does the job perfectly and it&#39;s probably less hassle than port forwarding.

My character is all dressed up and set to head out as a random horse decides to butt into my picture.


as I wandered around trying to find a cave to start my excavation in I found this cave

It seemed promising so I went ahead and started digging away

After digging into it a bit, I had encountered a mineral that didn&#39;t seem to fit in with the regular stone


I excavated it and to my surprise I had discovered these:

Fossils and bones, how convenient.

Even an ancient shattered relic


As I continued my excavation I fell into a shaft, as I landed I was greeted with this:

An entire deposit of fossils

Glorious victory to me, now I have to get back to the surface and look for resources needed to create an analyzer
That was my adventure so far today.

[editline]10th July 2011[/editline]

After putting the relic scraps and fossils into the analyzer, I only got bonemeal and 2 stoneboards which I had pieced together


The newly recovered stone boards showed some interesting pictures that were left behind.

Exploring around the cave a bit more, I face a life or death situation, a room filled with lava, in it tiny areas with gravel leading to massive amounts of archeological finds and other minerals, at the end of the obstacle, 2 creepers, will I succeed to reach my goal, or will I perish and my journey will end and so would my life?

both of the creepers would be completely dumb and jump into the lava giving me an express ticket to my loot.

After I had returned to my workplace I had put the fossils through the analyzer, I had started losing hope as I had only been getting bone meal, but then a heart stopping discovery, one of the fossils still had some DNA in it, it was the DNA of a Raptor!

It&#39;s as simple as it gets, after you had installed modloader, copy and paste the mod_Fossil.zip file into the mods folder which is in your .minecraft folder. thats how it&#39;s like for most modloader compatible mods.
