Well here&#39;s the thing. This is where the incident happened. I got attacked by the skeleton around the vicinity of the piece of cobblestone over on the left. The wolves were sitting in the room to the right:

Here&#39;s a better look at that room. There were three closed doors (but even if they were open, wolves can&#39;t go through them, right?) and both of the wolves were SITTING inside. I know there is no water or fire in that room... So what could have caused this?

Dear Mojang. If lightning can light trees on fire, try to make it so they don&#39;t create large-scale deforestation.  Although this WOULD be realistic, it would mean a lighting storm kills off all the trees in a (insert large number)-chunk radius. Also, since when has minecraft been realistic?

And then someone replied with

The way for it to work is like in real life- if a forest has been devastated by a fire, a bunch of saplings take advantage of the now-rich soil to grow over the same area.
How to implement this:
When leaves are burned, they drop saplings.
When saplings are left alone for a certain time, they plant themselves in the ground.
Then when a forest fire ravages an area, yeah, it&#39;ll be destroyed for a while, but since each tree is likely to drop more than one sapling (although some of them will probably burn up), you&#39;ll end up with more trees.

I think that would be interesting to implement, and would add a ton of realism to the game."

Make it so that every block you cannot obtain with bare hands unbreakable with bare hands out. 

For example, you could make a steel/stone jail, put a player with no items in it, and he could not get out.

Make it so that every block you cannot obtain with bare hands unbreakable with bare hands out.

Well there&#39;s mods to make blocks a property, which makes it so only the player who owns them can remove them (or rather it means that if you remove a block, it will near instantly respawn).

They had this on the server I went to, getting stuck in their subway system was a bitch because it was extremely long and you couldn&#39;t dig yourself out; the only way to get out was to find the one spot somewhere in the subway you could jump into lava."

Make it so that every block you cannot obtain with bare hands unbreakable with bare hands out. 

For example, you could make a steel/stone jail, put a player with no items in it, and he could not get out.

Well there&#39;s mods to make blocks a property, which makes it so only the player who owns them can remove them (or rather it means that if you remove a block, it will near instantly respawn).

They had this on the server I went to, getting stuck in their subway system was a bitch because it was extremely long and you couldn&#39;t dig yourself out; the only way to get out was to find the one spot somewhere in the subway you could jump into lava.</span>

If you mean setting the size of the window to 720 then you can set scale in the options to 1 and use winsize 2 to auto set the minecraft window on every launch."
