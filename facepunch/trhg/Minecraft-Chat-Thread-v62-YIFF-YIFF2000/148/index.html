They started out as cells, like every living thing in the world. They gradually evolved into long, thick, wormlike aquatic beings that lived in the most extreme depths of the ocean. Obviously, at these depths, it was very cold. These worm-like beings had glands that produced sulfur and thus made themselves miniature moving deep sea vents producing heat for themselves and their schools of worms. They progressed into fish moving into shallower waters, and then into reptilian creatures. By this time, they became the prey to many larger creatures, and learned to overwork their sulfur glands and cause them to explode, which obviously wasn&#39;t very effective since it killed both of them. It still worked though, like a bee-sting kills the bee and hurts the victim. Using their newfound ability, they became the top of the food-chain and started becoming the green suicide bombing penises we love today."

They started out as cells, like every living thing in the world. They gradually evolved into long, thick, wormlike aquatic beings that lived in the most extreme depths of the ocean. Obviously, at these depths, it was very cold. These worm-like beings had glands that produced sulfur and thus made themselves miniature moving deep sea vents producing heat for themselves and their schools of worms. They progressed into fish moving into shallower waters, and then into reptilian creatures. By this time, they became the prey to many larger creatures, and learned to overwork their sulfur glands and cause them to explode, which obviously wasn&#39;t very effective since it killed both of them. It still worked though, like a bee-sting kills the bee and hurts the victim. Using their newfound ability, they became the top of the food-chain and started becoming the green suicide bombing penises we love today.</span>

half of that is just the standard story of evolution of land creatures, the other half doesnt make sense. Bees reproduce because they work as a hivemind- creepers dont seem to do this and thus their evolutionary trait of exploding wouldnt get them to the top of the foodchain"

                        <postrender input="Aye, I had a theory that Creepers were a bit like bees, each colony led by a central, unseen Queen Creeper, who sends them out to colonise and fertilise the land. But I still adhere to Notch&#39;s words that they were &quot;crunchy like dry leaves&quot;, implying that they are mobile plants of some sort, like an explosive Triffid.

But that also drew me to the conclusion of all the Grass in Minecraft being Creeper sprouts, although that would imply that the &quot;Drone&quot; Creepers are female, since they carry the seeds in their bodies which they spread by exploding, and by that extension, the &quot;Queen&quot; would actually be a King, that fertilises all the females."

                            <span v-pre>Aye, I had a theory that Creepers were a bit like bees, each colony led by a central, unseen Queen Creeper, who sends them out to colonise and fertilise the land.

Because then their sole mechanism of breeding could be having their seeds fertilized by something they gain from humans (like nutrition), and when they explode they spread the fertilized spores that will eventually grow into more creepers that will continue the process.

                            <span v-pre>If creepers dropped spores or something that would eventually grow into new creepers unless removed, I would buy that whole &quot;creepers are plants&quot; thing.

Because then their sole mechanism of breeding could be having their seeds fertilized by something they gain from humans (like nutrition), and when they explode they spread the fertilized spores that will eventually grow into more creepers that will continue the process. This mechanism wouldn&#39;t be too far from how certain flowers and fungus work.</span>
