You don&#39;t need to learn MySQL to use log blocks really. All you need to do is input the username, password, database name, and host IP. After that log blocks will do everything for you. Also don&#39;t forget to put the mysql-connector jar in your lib folder or in the main folder where bukkit is running."

(Ignore the numbers)

It would be a fallout-ish style of gameplay focusing more on raiding and looting than actually cutting down trees or mining. There are scattered chests, iron on buildings, and also mines in scattered places around the map. Most people will want to stick to the city, as it would give them a nice area for PvPing for resources. Eventually, people would create alliances and group up, and certain natural factions would form. People would create their own towns and bases, and wars would naturally start. On the flipside, there could be some who just randomly kill people, but are naturally put in place by others. If something seemed too unbalanced, like an organization that pretty much took over the entire city, I would put them down to size for the fun of the rest of the players, possibly by mounting a creeper attack on their main base.

The main draw of this map besides the city, however, are the sneaky little easter eggs and events. Some of these include a failsafe switch hidden somewhere to &quot;destroy the server in case of catastrophe&quot;, an obsidian room holding a diamond block (it takes diamond to open this up, as well as about thirty minutes of staring at that block digging, so you have to be sure you&#39;re doing this in secret), mob spawners, basements full of traps, plenty of TNT traps, secret little buildings and cottages out in the wild, and much more.

Events would be triggered by me, the admin, and would include things such as spawning loads of creepers or other mobs, opening up a vault of diamond for people to squabble over, releasing a bit of lava around the city, blowing up a building, me walking around in full diamond armor and diamond sword holding lots of goodies for whoever kills me, making a mysterious island appear over the city, and other things. 

The map would be constantly changing, so sometimes I would add little cottages around the outskirts of the towns, refill chests, remove torches, add monster spawners, burn forests, creating pockets of diamond ore in caves, and other little things to add to the replayability.

There would be a schedule, so for example, I would create an event on every Saturday and Wednesday, and maybe opening a vault every Monday for people to search for the rest of the week, revealing the coordinates, one axis every hour, on Friday. Maybe a Mob Monday, in which a random mob would be spawned quite a bit? This could be friendly or enemy mobs, so you may have a couple ghasts in the sky, loads of pigs in a building, or skeleton invasion from the sewers.

The rules would be a tad more complicated than most PvP servers, but all for good reason.

Some server statistics: Fire would not spread (too many wood buildings), PvE enabled, PvP enabled, creepers would be nerfed (would be ajusted and tweaked)

[release]
[u]General Rules[/u]
1. No destroying something unless you have a real purpose, like gathering resources, setting traps, or such. AKA no random griefing of unused buildings. We can&#39;t moniter you 24/7, but occasionally I will check griefing with BB. Any random griefing will be dealt with at least a 1 day confinement/ban. 

1.5. [b]NO GAINING ENTRY INTO BASES BY DESTROYING BLOCKS.[/b] This is a rule that will be dealt with severely. If you can&#39;t gain entry into it without walking in or opening a door (with a non-placed lever), you can&#39;t get into it. If someone accuses you of gaining entry, be sure to have a good reason, like an inside man making a secret passage, and such. [i](Don&#39;t worry, if you tell me an inside man or something confidential, I will not tell anyone of the opposing faction. I&#39;m a neutral party.)[/i] You may gain entry with ladders and TNT, however, so make your bases multi-walled and/or with lips on the walls!

2. Killing someone within the boundaries of the spawn is simply not allowed, as well as killing someone repeatedly as long as they are not properly prepared. Feel free to attempt to kill that guy that has the iron armor, or someone you know that has good stuff, but generally don&#39;t be mean to newcomers and kill them when they don&#39;t have anything of value. Anyone that attacks you is fair game, however.

3. No hacking or using duping glitches, blah blah blah

4. Be respectful and ethical, but you can trash talk a little if you really want to. Just keep it to a minimum. Drama should be taken care of by a duel, not rants and COOL CAPS messages over the public chat.

5. No abusing your mod powers. This means giving yourself an advantage over other players will result in a ban or demotion.

6. Feel free to use TNT, but no more than three at a time. Any more than three TNTs exploding at once will get you a warning. Also, only use it to accomplish a purpose. Don&#39;t blow up a building if no one is in it, or just for fun. Make traps, use it for combat purposes, mine with it, or anything like that.

All punishments will likely be dealt with in an RP sense. For example, instead of a ban, you could be put in a jail and all commands revoked. If you commit a minor offense, maybe a duel with the victim of your wrong-doing could earn you less jail time, or none at all! Bans will only be for extremely serious crimes and when seen fit.


[u]Faction Rules[/u]
1. In order to start a faction, you must have 4 or more people together, created a significant town or fortress, and have one obsidian block with you. An admin will give you the rights to a town and a spot on the OP.

2. You must have a main town or fortress, and inside that, a government office or castle of sorts which is the equivalent of your White House and such. Inside there, an Obsidian totem must be placed in plain sight, and accessible to reach. This is the heart of your nation. A diamond block must be placed atop that to indicate that this is the heart of the entire faction, not just an outpost.

3. Any towns must have a similar government outpost or capitol with an obsidian block inside, and a gold block atop it. Once this is destroyed, the town is now under the faction that destroyed its&#39; control.

4. You may only break this block if you are a member of the opposing faction, and in war with the obsidian&#39;s faction.

5. In order to be a major faction, you must have at least two other [i]recognized (Obsidian and gold block)[/i] towns or outposts aside from the capitol.

6. To successfully destroy a faction, you must claim at least half of (round up) their outposts and cities, then their capitol.

6.5. Lets say that a faction has 6 cities and a capitol. A single faction has to destroy 3 of those faction&#39;s cities, then destroy their capitol.

7. Major factions get a few more bonuses, which are soon to be decided. Possibly a private chat? Or an allowance of materials for sustainability?


[u]War Rules[/u]
1. To declare war on another nation/faction is to say that you will invade their territory and are enemies. The sole purpose of war is to take over another nation&#39;s cities and outposts, and take their collected resources there for yourself.

2. You must declare war 30 minutes before taking over another nation. You can wait as long as you like after those 30 minutes, but are still in war. This means that you can declare war, then wait five days before attacking the city. The current relations between cities and factions will be on the OP.

3. During an assault on an enemy base, you may not break or place blocks to enter. So no stacking or tunneling, the only ways of entry are TNT, ladders, and secret entrances. No placing levers. If a door or gate is open, walk right in.

4. If you are killed inside the city as a victim of the attack, you may not spawn back into it via /home, but can only walk in from spawn. The place is captured once the obsidian totem is destroyed in the center of the towns area or the citizens all killed.

5. Once the encampment is captured, all /lwc&#39;d chests will be unlocked, and all permissions removed from the outpost/city.

6. You may only attack a place if there is 2 or more people, and you do not outnumber them by more than 3.


[u]Admin Rules[/u]
1. Never, ever use /give unless endorsed by me, the server admin. This may have certain instances where I could allow things, such as events, but that would likely be me adding you into a certain &quot;builders&quot; group.

2. If you are a high-level admin with commands such as /tp and /give, you may not join factions, but simply help the lore of the server and contribute with your moderation. You may step down and gain only /ban and /kick and such, and be able to join a faction and play on the server if you wish.

3. If you are a high level admin as stated earlier, you cannot give any information given to you as the result of moderation. For example, lets say Inacio gets into an enemy base. lilcheese gets angry about his base being broken into, and tells a mod he suspects that Inacio tunneled in or such. Inacio will tell me that Asure was actually a double agent for Inacio, and is pretending to be on lilcheese&#39;s side! The mods involved in this case or learning this knowledge may not tell anyone this, and simply say that Inacio had a valid reason. You may not tell any way that Inacio or anyone got into the base, even if it was TNT, to protect suspicion.

4. No banning/jailing for a period of more than 1 day unless you contact another mod. If you are the only one present, hold them for the time you feel you should, then contact a mod as soon as possible. Use proper judgement.
[/release]

Some other things that would be included in the game would be a sort of &quot;Chezmart&quot; deal, where with in-game materials, you could buy other materials, like lightstone, neatherrack, and other sorts of things. As well as these in-game things, you could gain some treasure-tips, which would be coordinates leading to or near a treasure or significant area, as well as a strategy map, which would be a map of the city with lots of combat tips (this place is great for ambushes!) or other assorted tips (this place has a secret!). I would post prices in the op, and it would add some more fun and role-playing to the game. Raffles or lotteries would also be in effect, where each person would put one diamond into a chest, or give them to me. Then, they would all stand on a dirt block, with chests under each block. One chest has 3/4 of the pot, and the other portions of it put in a couple other chests. Little events like these would make it more fun for everyone!

This shop would also be a base for other quests I would have available, so you could earn diamonds or gold by completing tasks. An example of this would be to go to THE SPOOKY TEMPLE and finding the item in the chest (it could be anything, from reeds to gold) and bringing it back to me for the real prize. Another would be to stem the flow of water at the source that has been seeping from a nearby mountain and flooding the town. 
Some of these quests would involve other organizations, and depending on the balance of power, I may set quests to set some overpowered organizations down to size by requesting them to kill someone, or sabotage a base for money. If someone needed a quest done, they could put down money for a reward (20-40% of the reward money goes to me to prevent ludicrous amounts of user quests) to get something done for them.

[QUOTE=Chezhead;28987206]I&#39;m going to write up a quick proof of concept I thought of for a server. Tell me what you think before I buy the server and put it up.

Basically, Broville v8 for the map.

[img_thumb]http://gyazo.com/4c37b2b931302d63017ab9e2f25826fe.png[/img_thumb]
(Ignore the numbers)

It would be a fallout-ish style of gameplay focusing more on raiding and looting than actually cutting down trees or mining. There are scattered chests, iron on buildings, and also mines in scattered places around the map. Most people will want to stick to the city, as it would give them a nice area for PvPing for resources. Eventually, people would create alliances and group up, and certain natural factions would form. People would create their own towns and bases, and wars would naturally start. On the flipside, there could be some who just randomly kill people, but are naturally put in place by others. If something seemed too unbalanced, like an organization that pretty much took over the entire city, I would put them down to size for the fun of the rest of the players, possibly by mounting a creeper attack on their main base.

The main draw of this map besides the city, however, are the sneaky little easter eggs and events. Some of these include a failsafe switch hidden somewhere to &quot;destroy the server in case of catastrophe&quot;, an obsidian room holding a diamond block (it takes diamond to open this up, as well as about thirty minutes of staring at that block digging, so you have to be sure you&#39;re doing this in secret), mob spawners, basements full of traps, plenty of TNT traps, secret little buildings and cottages out in the wild, and much more.

Events would be triggered by me, the admin, and would include things such as spawning loads of creepers or other mobs, opening up a vault of diamond for people to squabble over, releasing a bit of lava around the city, blowing up a building, me walking around in full diamond armor and diamond sword holding lots of goodies for whoever kills me, making a mysterious island appear over the city, and other things. 

The map would be constantly changing, so sometimes I would add little cottages around the outskirts of the towns, refill chests, remove torches, add monster spawners, burn forests, creating pockets of diamond ore in caves, and other little things to add to the replayability.

There would be a schedule, so for example, I would create an event on every Saturday and Wednesday, and maybe opening a vault every Monday for people to search for the rest of the week, revealing the coordinates, one axis every hour, on Friday. Maybe a Mob Monday, in which a random mob would be spawned quite a bit? This could be friendly or enemy mobs, so you may have a couple ghasts in the sky, loads of pigs in a building, or skeleton invasion from the sewers.

The rules would be a tad more complicated than most PvP servers, but all for good reason.

Some server statistics: Fire would not spread (too many wood buildings), PvE enabled, PvP enabled, creepers would be nerfed (would be ajusted and tweaked)

[release]
[u]General Rules[/u]
1. No destroying something unless you have a real purpose, like gathering resources, setting traps, or such. AKA no random griefing of unused buildings. We can&#39;t moniter you 24/7, but occasionally I will check griefing with BB. Any random griefing will be dealt with at least a 1 day confinement/ban. 

1.5. [b]NO GAINING ENTRY INTO BASES BY DESTROYING BLOCKS.[/b] This is a rule that will be dealt with severely. If you can&#39;t gain entry into it without walking in or opening a door (with a non-placed lever), you can&#39;t get into it. If someone accuses you of gaining entry, be sure to have a good reason, like an inside man making a secret passage, and such. [i](Don&#39;t worry, if you tell me an inside man or something confidential, I will not tell anyone of the opposing faction. I&#39;m a neutral party.)[/i] You may gain entry with ladders and TNT, however, so make your bases multi-walled and/or with lips on the walls!

2. Killing someone within the boundaries of the spawn is simply not allowed, as well as killing someone repeatedly as long as they are not properly prepared. Feel free to attempt to kill that guy that has the iron armor, or someone you know that has good stuff, but generally don&#39;t be mean to newcomers and kill them when they don&#39;t have anything of value. Anyone that attacks you is fair game, however.

3. No hacking or using duping glitches, blah blah blah

4. Be respectful and ethical, but you can trash talk a little if you really want to. Just keep it to a minimum. Drama should be taken care of by a duel, not rants and COOL CAPS messages over the public chat.

5. No abusing your mod powers. This means giving yourself an advantage over other players will result in a ban or demotion.

6. Feel free to use TNT, but no more than three at a time. Any more than three TNTs exploding at once will get you a warning. Also, only use it to accomplish a purpose. Don&#39;t blow up a building if no one is in it, or just for fun. Make traps, use it for combat purposes, mine with it, or anything like that.

All punishments will likely be dealt with in an RP sense. For example, instead of a ban, you could be put in a jail and all commands revoked. If you commit a minor offense, maybe a duel with the victim of your wrong-doing could earn you less jail time, or none at all! Bans will only be for extremely serious crimes and when seen fit.


[u]Faction Rules[/u]
1. In order to start a faction, you must have 4 or more people together, created a significant town or fortress, and have one obsidian block with you. An admin will give you the rights to a town and a spot on the OP.

2. You must have a main town or fortress, and inside that, a government office or castle of sorts which is the equivalent of your White House and such. Inside there, an Obsidian totem must be placed in plain sight, and accessible to reach. This is the heart of your nation. A diamond block must be placed atop that to indicate that this is the heart of the entire faction, not just an outpost.

3. Any towns must have a similar government outpost or capitol with an obsidian block inside, and a gold block atop it. Once this is destroyed, the town is now under the faction that destroyed its&#39; control.

4. You may only break this block if you are a member of the opposing faction, and in war with the obsidian&#39;s faction.

5. In order to be a major faction, you must have at least two other [i]recognized (Obsidian and gold block)[/i] towns or outposts aside from the capitol.

6. To successfully destroy a faction, you must claim at least half of (round up) their outposts and cities, then their capitol.

6.5. Lets say that a faction has 6 cities and a capitol. A single faction has to destroy 3 of those faction&#39;s cities, then destroy their capitol.

7. Major factions get a few more bonuses, which are soon to be decided. Possibly a private chat? Or an allowance of materials for sustainability?


[u]War Rules[/u]
1. To declare war on another nation/faction is to say that you will invade their territory and are enemies. The sole purpose of war is to take over another nation&#39;s cities and outposts, and take their collected resources there for yourself.

2. You must declare war 30 minutes before taking over another nation. You can wait as long as you like after those 30 minutes, but are still in war. This means that you can declare war, then wait five days before attacking the city. The current relations between cities and factions will be on the OP.

3. During an assault on an enemy base, you may not break or place blocks to enter. So no stacking or tunneling, the only ways of entry are TNT, ladders, and secret entrances. No placing levers. If a door or gate is open, walk right in.

4. If you are killed inside the city as a victim of the attack, you may not spawn back into it via /home, but can only walk in from spawn. The place is captured once the obsidian totem is destroyed in the center of the towns area or the citizens all killed.

5. Once the encampment is captured, all /lwc&#39;d chests will be unlocked, and all permissions removed from the outpost/city.

6. You may only attack a place if there is 2 or more people, and you do not outnumber them by more than 3.


[u]Admin Rules[/u]
1. Never, ever use /give unless endorsed by me, the server admin. This may have certain instances where I could allow things, such as events, but that would likely be me adding you into a certain &quot;builders&quot; group.

2. If you are a high-level admin with commands such as /tp and /give, you may not join factions, but simply help the lore of the server and contribute with your moderation. You may step down and gain only /ban and /kick and such, and be able to join a faction and play on the server if you wish.

3. If you are a high level admin as stated earlier, you cannot give any information given to you as the result of moderation. For example, lets say Inacio gets into an enemy base. lilcheese gets angry about his base being broken into, and tells a mod he suspects that Inacio tunneled in or such. Inacio will tell me that Asure was actually a double agent for Inacio, and is pretending to be on lilcheese&#39;s side! The mods involved in this case or learning this knowledge may not tell anyone this, and simply say that Inacio had a valid reason. You may not tell any way that Inacio or anyone got into the base, even if it was TNT, to protect suspicion.
[/release]

Some other things that would be included in the game would be a sort of &quot;Chezmart&quot; deal, where with in-game materials, you could buy other materials, like lightstone, neatherrack, and other sorts of things. As well as these in-game things, you could gain some treasure-tips, which would be coordinates leading to or near a treasure or significant area, as well as a strategy map, which would be a map of the city with lots of combat tips (this place is great for ambushes!) or other assorted tips (this place has a secret!). I would post prices in the op, and it would add some more fun and role-playing to the game.

This shop would also be a base for other quests I would have available, so you could earn diamonds or gold by completing tasks. An example of this would be to go to THE SPOOKY TEMPLE and finding the item in the chest (it could be anything, from reeds to gold) and bringing it back to me for the real prize. Another would be to stem the flow of water at the source that has been seeping from a nearby mountain and flooding the town. 
Some of these quests would involve other organizations, and depending on the balance of power, I may set quests to set some overpowered organizations down to size by requesting them to kill someone, or sabotage a base for money. If someone needed a quest done, they could put down money for a reward (20-40% of the reward money goes to me to prevent ludicrous amounts of user quests) to get something done for them.

[b]So, what do you think? Would you like playing on this sort of server? Do you have any other ideas?[/b][/QUOTE]
