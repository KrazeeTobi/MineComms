Is anyone else having torches not light anything? I got stuck in a cave and it&#39;s weird.[/QUOTE]
 
I had an opposite issue. This tunnel that goes straight down is full-bright but really, the light should be fading as I near the bottom.

                        <postrender input="Minecraft needs a major over-haul on their minecart system.
First off, powered carts need to be more useful than they are now. They&#39;re slow, cumbersome, and they can&#39;t push for shit up hills or slopes. To make them more useful, they need to be faster, easier to use (in terms of fuel) and stronger.
Something that&#39;s been recommended by tons of players is the ability to link carts together, and no doubt this would be a great option to have. Perhaps a new craftable item called a Linkage or Pin or something of the sort that, when used with right-click while equipped, will link the cart you clicked on to the cart on the side you clicked on (so if you clicked on the north side of the cart, it would attempt to link to the cart to the north of it). To undo a link between two carts, you have to &quot;attack&quot; a side of a cart facing the cart you want to unlink it from.
Another feature that would make powered carts useful is, of course, more speed. As it is they&#39;re not as fast as a player at walking speed. A possible fix for this that would still allow users a chance to catch up is to give the cart an acceleration period, in which it gradually reaches its top speed. Acceleration time will depend on how many carts are linked to it: the more carts, the longer it takes to gain speed (within reasonable limits, of course). So an unloaded powered cart or a powered cart pushing 1-2 other carts could accelerate to top-speed in about 4-7 seconds, loaded down with 10 carts it may take 15-30 seconds (or whatever&#39;s most reasonable). If it takes too long to speed up for you, multiple powered carts can be linked in the same train to increase acceleration, but not top-speed. Top-speed should be 30-60% faster than a player can walk, which isn&#39;t hyper-speed considering what boosters can do, but Notch has mentioned &quot;fixing&quot; boosters so they no longer work, so this is something to think about.
Regarding fuel, currently a powered cart just takes off when you right-click it with a piece of coal, which lasts approximately 4 minutes. It&#39;s a respectable time but for those who have long runs of minetracks to various locations on the map longer run-times would be more desirable. A player could link a powered cart to a storage cart with coal/charcoal in it, and when the powered cart needs more fuel, it simply takes it from the storage chest. Another problem however with the current method is the cart just starts immediately when you give it coal and there&#39;s no means of stopping it short of running it into a wall. To solve this, it could be made so a player must interact with the cart in some way to start/stop the cart. This could be done by having the player &quot;attack&quot; the cart with an empty hand or simply something that isn&#39;t a tool, but this prevents a player from breaking down carts with their bare damn hands if they want to. Alternatively, a player could use a shovel on the cart (as if they were shoveling coal into it) to start/stop the cart.
Now, with a better powered minecart there should be a better track system. The current &quot;South-West Rule&quot; among other things eliminates alot of potential in track designs. To solve this, X-intersections of minecart tracks should simply function as straight tracks with no direction change. To cause such an intersection to function as a switching section, redstone can be used to power the sections of track on certain sides. For instance, say a cart is heading North on a track and is coming up to an X-intersection, and the player wants the cart to switch to the East track. To do this, redstone is used to power the track sections on the pieces of track just south of the intersection and just East of the intersection, which would cause the straight section of track in the middle of the intersection to change into a curved piece of track which would take the cart East. When power is removed from the adjacent sections, it would revert back to a straight section of track."

                            <span v-pre>Minecraft needs a major over-haul on their minecart system.
First off, powered carts need to be more useful than they are now. They&#39;re slow, cumbersome, and they can&#39;t push for shit up hills or slopes. To make them more useful, they need to be faster, easier to use (in terms of fuel) and stronger.
Something that&#39;s been recommended by tons of players is the ability to link carts together, and no doubt this would be a great option to have. Perhaps a new craftable item called a Linkage or Pin or something of the sort that, when used with right-click while equipped, will link the cart you clicked on to the cart on the side you clicked on (so if you clicked on the north side of the cart, it would attempt to link to the cart to the north of it). To undo a link between two carts, you have to &quot;attack&quot; a side of a cart facing the cart you want to unlink it from.
Another feature that would make powered carts useful is, of course, more speed. As it is they&#39;re not as fast as a player at walking speed. A possible fix for this that would still allow users a chance to catch up is to give the cart an acceleration period, in which it gradually reaches its top speed. Acceleration time will depend on how many carts are linked to it: the more carts, the longer it takes to gain speed (within reasonable limits, of course). So an unloaded powered cart or a powered cart pushing 1-2 other carts could accelerate to top-speed in about 4-7 seconds, loaded down with 10 carts it may take 15-30 seconds (or whatever&#39;s most reasonable). If it takes too long to speed up for you, multiple powered carts can be linked in the same train to increase acceleration, but not top-speed. Top-speed should be 30-60% faster than a player can walk, which isn&#39;t hyper-speed considering what boosters can do, but Notch has mentioned &quot;fixing&quot; boosters so they no longer work, so this is something to think about.
Regarding fuel, currently a powered cart just takes off when you right-click it with a piece of coal, which lasts approximately 4 minutes. It&#39;s a respectable time but for those who have long runs of minetracks to various locations on the map longer run-times would be more desirable. A player could link a powered cart to a storage cart with coal/charcoal in it, and when the powered cart needs more fuel, it simply takes it from the storage chest. Another problem however with the current method is the cart just starts immediately when you give it coal and there&#39;s no means of stopping it short of running it into a wall. To solve this, it could be made so a player must interact with the cart in some way to start/stop the cart. This could be done by having the player &quot;attack&quot; the cart with an empty hand or simply something that isn&#39;t a tool, but this prevents a player from breaking down carts with their bare damn hands if they want to. Alternatively, a player could use a shovel on the cart (as if they were shoveling coal into it) to start/stop the cart.
Now, with a better powered minecart there should be a better track system. The current &quot;South-West Rule&quot; among other things eliminates alot of potential in track designs. To solve this, X-intersections of minecart tracks should simply function as straight tracks with no direction change. To cause such an intersection to function as a switching section, redstone can be used to power the sections of track on certain sides. For instance, say a cart is heading North on a track and is coming up to an X-intersection, and the player wants the cart to switch to the East track. To do this, redstone is used to power the track sections on the pieces of track just south of the intersection and just East of the intersection, which would cause the straight section of track in the middle of the intersection to change into a curved piece of track which would take the cart East. When power is removed from the adjacent sections, it would revert back to a straight section of track.</span>

[QUOTE=Zero-Point;28943430]Minecraft needs a major over-haul on their minecart system.
First off, powered carts need to be more useful than they are now. They&#39;re slow, cumbersome, and they can&#39;t push for shit up hills or slopes. To make them more useful, they need to be faster, easier to use (in terms of fuel) and stronger.
Something that&#39;s been recommended by tons of players is the ability to link carts together, and no doubt this would be a great option to have. Perhaps a new craftable item called a Linkage or Pin or something of the sort that, when used with right-click while equipped, will link the cart you clicked on to the cart on the side you clicked on (so if you clicked on the north side of the cart, it would attempt to link to the cart to the north of it). To undo a link between two carts, you have to &quot;attack&quot; a side of a cart facing the cart you want to unlink it from.
Another feature that would make powered carts useful is, of course, more speed. As it is they&#39;re not as fast as a player at walking speed. A possible fix for this that would still allow users a chance to catch up is to give the cart an acceleration period, in which it gradually reaches its top speed. Acceleration time will depend on how many carts are linked to it: the more carts, the longer it takes to gain speed (within reasonable limits, of course). So an unloaded powered cart or a powered cart pushing 1-2 other carts could accelerate to top-speed in about 4-7 seconds, loaded down with 10 carts it may take 15-30 seconds (or whatever&#39;s most reasonable). If it takes too long to speed up for you, multiple powered carts can be linked in the same train to increase acceleration, but not top-speed. Top-speed should be 30-60% faster than a player can walk, which isn&#39;t hyper-speed considering what boosters can do, but Notch has mentioned &quot;fixing&quot; boosters so they no longer work, so this is something to think about.
Regarding fuel, currently a powered cart just takes off when you right-click it with a piece of coal, which lasts approximately 4 minutes. It&#39;s a respectable time but for those who have long runs of minetracks to various locations on the map longer run-times would be more desirable. A player could link a powered cart to a storage cart with coal/charcoal in it, and when the powered cart needs more fuel, it simply takes it from the storage chest. Another problem however with the current method is the cart just starts immediately when you give it coal and there&#39;s no means of stopping it short of running it into a wall. To solve this, it could be made so a player must interact with the cart in some way to start/stop the cart. This could be done by having the player &quot;attack&quot; the cart with an empty hand or simply something that isn&#39;t a tool, but this prevents a player from breaking down carts with their bare damn hands if they want to. Alternatively, a player could use a shovel on the cart (as if they were shoveling coal into it) to start/stop the cart.
Now, with a better powered minecart there should be a better track system. The current &quot;South-West Rule&quot; among other things eliminates alot of potential in track designs. To solve this, X-intersections of minecart tracks should simply function as straight tracks with no direction change. To cause such an intersection to function as a switching section, redstone can be used to power the sections of track on certain sides. For instance, say a cart is heading North on a track and is coming up to an X-intersection, and the player wants the cart to switch to the East track. To do this, redstone is used to power the track sections on the pieces of track just south of the intersection and just East of the intersection, which would cause the straight section of track in the middle of the intersection to change into a curved piece of track which would take the cart East. When power is removed from the adjacent sections, it would revert back to a straight section of track.[/QUOTE]

I forget to replace the back of the fire place with cobble stone so my whole mansion burned down. I lost an hours worth of work and had to rebuild it. But as I was panicking my first dog, Spot, was on fire and yelping in pain. As he burned to death and died, my heart was ripped in half. My very first dog, killed in a horribly. I now have a grave for him outside of my newly built house.[/QUOTE]
 
Reminds me of my first dog&#39;s death yesterday.I was playing on the Survival Underground map and I was covering up a lava pool.I was attacked by a skeleton and even though I made him sit in my house he rushed to the rescue.Sadly,while we were walking back home on the cobbled up lava pool,he randomly burst into flames.The lava was two blocks under the cobble.Before,when I first started the map,loads of wolves spawned.Now,I can&#39;t find any. :(

Link to the Suvival Underground map,if you want it.It&#39;s bloody amazing and it&#39;s a whole different experience.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Bot02;28943432]My dog Spot died in a fire. I was trying to make a fire place in my giant log cabin I spent an hour on, and I lit the fireplace. I forget to replace the back of the fire place with cobble stone so my whole mansion burned down. I lost an hours worth of work and had to rebuild it. But as I was panicking my first dog, Spot, was on fire and yelping in pain. As he burned to death and died, my heart was ripped in half. My very first dog, killed in a horribly. I now have a grave for him outside of my newly built house.[/QUOTE]
 
Reminds me of my first dog&#39;s death yesterday.I was playing on the Survival Underground map and I was covering up a lava pool.I was attacked by a skeleton and even though I made him sit in my house he rushed to the rescue.Sadly,while we were walking back home on the cobbled up lava pool,he randomly burst into flames.The lava was two blocks under the cobble.Before,when I first started the map,loads of wolves spawned.Now,I can&#39;t find any. :(
