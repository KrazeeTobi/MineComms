They make a thread, copy all the active or online members, and post it in the GMF.

My guess is that he&#39;s started turning into a project manager, I&#39;ve seen it happen again and again. He&#39;s showing the symptoms and I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s already gonner.

If you have a co-worker promoted to project manager, you may see the signs in your friend too.

First, the time he spends in the same country as his team starts decreasing, this continues until it gets to the point they can just about remember his name but can&#39;t remember what he looks like.

The first really worrying thing you&#39;ll notice, is that he will start promising things on your behalf. This is part of his job, but once he has broken the barrier between asking-you-first and telling-you-after, there&#39;s no going back.

Next he starts believing Gantt charts. He&#39;s already forgotten how difficult it is to estimate coding and debugging time and thinks that programmers just know. 
It&#39;s quite obvious at this point that his memory of being a programmer has been replaced by charts, schedules and lunches with other managers.

Around this time his vocabulary will start changing: &quot;people&quot; are now &quot;resources&quot;, a &quot;downside&quot; becomes a &quot;caveat&quot; and &quot;fuck-ups&quot; are now called &quot;issues&quot;. 
The word &quot;bug&quot; will cause him to have heart palpitations, so you should start using &quot;issues&quot; as well.

Next he will send a profiling questionnaire to everybody, to find out the skills of his workforce. This includes a number of people he&#39;s worked with for several years.

Once he puts a suggestions box in the kitchen, you may as well give up. He&#39;s gone."
