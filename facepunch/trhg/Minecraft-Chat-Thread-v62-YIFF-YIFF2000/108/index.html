Way to be a dick, dick.
Can&#39;t I share my opinion on these forums without getting &quot;trolled&quot; because someone doesn&#39;t agree with my opinion? No it doesn&#39;t hurt me, it doesn&#39;t hurt anyone, but it doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t say my 2 cents about it. Disagree all you want, don&#39;t be a fucking dick about it."

I did answer your question. In fact I answered it before you asked it. Read what I have said and you&#39;ll see why I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s pointless to me.

I hate to bring another game into this but it&#39;s a good example. Take Halo, when you earn achievements you can unlock parts for your spartan armor. Now it doesn&#39;t add anything to the gameplay, but it does unlock better looking parts. As I said, it doesn&#39;t add to the gameplay, HOWEVER it does add to the customization of the player. It also acts as visual evidence to other players that you&#39;ve earned some achievements to get that armor.

In minecraft you don&#39;t get anything. At all. Which is why I believe it&#39;s pointless. I can&#39;t think of what achievements could unlock for people, but it doesn&#39;t do anything for the game. It only shows that you&#39;ve completed certain tasks."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=EastBayWilly;29110523]I did answer your question. In fact I answered it before you asked it. Read what I have said and you&#39;ll see why I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s pointless to me.

I hate to bring another game into this but it&#39;s a good example. Take Halo, when you earn achievements you can unlock parts for your spartan armor. Now it doesn&#39;t add anything to the gameplay, but it does unlock better looking parts. As I said, it doesn&#39;t add to the gameplay, HOWEVER it does add to the customization of the player. It also acts as visual evidence to other players that you&#39;ve earned some achievements to get that armor.

In minecraft you don&#39;t get anything. At all. Which is why I believe it&#39;s pointless. I can&#39;t think of what achievements could unlock for people, but it doesn&#39;t do anything for the game. It only shows that you&#39;ve completed certain tasks.[/QUOTE]

I can live with that. But only if one of those capes has a batman symbol on it and you earn it by falling 100 blocks into water. (That&#39;s a huge hole :xd:)
