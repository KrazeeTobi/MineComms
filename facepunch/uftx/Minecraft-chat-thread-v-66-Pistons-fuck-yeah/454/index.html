Well, you can go with Yogbox, which adds oodles of adventurous things to do in Singleplayer, or you can get the Technic Pack, which adds all sorts of machines, minerals, and new things like volcanoes.  

It&#39;s a damn shame the both of them can&#39;t be installed together, I love the volcanoes and junk the Technic pack adds."

Volcanoes,quartz(or was it marble,can&#39;t remember)and the 3 gems that make tools are part of Redpower 2(yes,the redstone mod).You can get those things if you install the Redpower World module but I think that one hasn&#39;t been released standalone yet.

What I do is set myself invisible to all players, and elevate myself far above the rift and I create it and expand it myself, and also spawn creatures. It&#39;s kinda a good thing though, if I see it&#39;s too hard I can slow down on the mob spawning and the expanding of the rift. I want it to be challenging, but not frustrating for the players. I can spawn as many creatures and any type I want, and I can expand the rift where I want it to. I have full control of it.

As far as they know, it&#39;s a plugin ;)"

                            <span v-pre>No it&#39;s not unfortunately. 

What I do is set myself invisible to all players, and elevate myself far above the rift and I create it and expand it myself, and also spawn creatures. It&#39;s kinda a good thing though, if I see it&#39;s too hard I can slow down on the mob spawning and the expanding of the rift. I want it to be challenging, but not frustrating for the players. I can spawn as many creatures and any type I want, and I can expand the rift where I want it to. I have full control of it.

As far as they know, it&#39;s a plugin ;)</span>

In the last 24 hours rifts have been tearing through the worlds surface and spawning all kinds of nether monsters. If all the factions don&#39;t get together and fight their way into the core and destroy the spawners, the rift grows larger and larger and consumes more land and towns. 

A few hours ago we had the biggest rift yet. An entire faction town was  overrun and burned to the ground, another was lucky and they were able to fight off the invasion.

When the rift core is destroyed, the entire mass of netherack disintegrates into sand and falls down on itself, giving the players only seconds to get out before being suffocated. I posted the recent images below.

                            <span v-pre>not too minecraft related but is the minecraft site always this slow and shitty? i keep getting 505 errors and the game loads extremely fast. neither do i get any password retrieval emails so i can be reminded my password for the site since i haven&#39;t logged on in a year.

edit: at this rate i&#39;m getting worried about buying the game it in case it won&#39;t register the purchase if the site fucks up when i try to submit the purchase</span>

                            <span v-pre>I wanna see a server where there&#39;s three factions: Castle A, Castle B, and then the Peasants.

Castle A attacks Castle B in sieges, otherwise builds and expands its internal economy and armies
Castle B does the same as Castle A
Peasants just build and farm and stuff until they&#39;re hired by a castle.


Just simple building with an occasional attack. Who doesn&#39;t like castles?</span>
