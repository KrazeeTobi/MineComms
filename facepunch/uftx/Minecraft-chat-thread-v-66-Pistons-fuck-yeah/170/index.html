Because I absolutely hate when people force their &quot;OCD&quot; on others, so what if you must have everything absolutely symmetrical, don&#39;t tell others don&#39;t even ASK others to do something such as that for your sake while they hardly give a damn about it, you&#39;re not even playing on the map the other guy is playing, I honestly couldn&#39;t care less whether something is symmetrical or not, you are selfish for asking me to do that solely for YOUR sake.

You had basically said &quot;Hey mine this for me because [i]I[/i] do not find it appealing even though I am not the one who is playing nor am I in possession of that map which does not belong to me&quot;"

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=Gmod4ever;31901936]Hey guys, maybe you can help me out with something?

I was playing Minecraft early yesterday with my friends, on a server I&#39;m hosting on my laptop. The server is running the Buildcraft 2.0.1 multiplayer, and all the mods are set up fine between the server and client, so that&#39;s not an issue.

We were playing fine for about 4 or so hours, and then I had to go do some stuff for a few hours. When I came back and tried to connect to the server, it would say &quot;Logging in...&quot; then just go to the background screen with no text, then lock up and go to a black screen, not responding for a few seconds, until then I could close it (still black screen).

The only thing I had done between my earlier play and this play was install the HL texture pack, but I smartly backed up my minecraft.JAR before installing it, in case it caused issues, because I didn&#39;t want to install BuildCraft again. I also had it installed before we started playing, but I overwrote that version when I forced Minecraft to do a clean update and then I installed the necessary mods for Buildcraft 2.0.1

So I thought maybe the HL texture pack was the issue, so I used the MCPatcher to &quot;Unpatch&quot; and tried again. Same thing.

I then decided to overwrite my existing minecraft.JAR with my backed up JAR (from before I installed the HL texture pack; the exact same JAR I was using to play with my friends earlier). Same thing.

I asked one of my friends, who was playing on the server at the time, to give me a copy of his JAR, since I [b]knew[/b] his worked, since he was playing. Same thing.

I then forced Minecraft to do a clean update, then put in my backed up JAR. Still same thing.

Do note that there was one period of time during all of this where I [b]was[/b] able to connect. However, within 5-7 seconds (timed it with a stopwatch), I would lock up and black screen. Every time. It started doing this on the second try with one of the JARs. However, after trying it 3 times, with it locking up a few seconds in, it started going back to the not-even-getting-into-game lockup blackscreen.

I tried again this morning, and the same thing. Any ideas as to why it is doing this to me? Note that throughout all of this, my friends are able to connect and play on the server fine. I have not tried with any other server yet.[/QUOTE]

Any thoughts? Still having this issue. :saddowns:"

When I came back and tried to connect to the server, it would say &quot;Logging in...&quot; then just go to the background screen with no text, then lock up and go to a black screen, not responding for a few seconds, until then I could close it (still black screen).

The only thing I had done between my earlier play and this play was install the HL texture pack, but I smartly backed up my minecraft.JAR before installing it, in case it caused issues, because I didn&#39;t want to install BuildCraft again. I also had it installed before we started playing, but I overwrote that version when I forced Minecraft to do a clean update and then I installed the necessary mods for Buildcraft 2.0.1

So I thought maybe the HL texture pack was the issue, so I used the MCPatcher to &quot;Unpatch&quot; and tried again. Same thing.

I then decided to overwrite my existing minecraft.JAR with my backed up JAR (from before I installed the HL texture pack; the exact same JAR I was using to play with my friends earlier). Same thing.

I asked one of my friends, who was playing on the server at the time, to give me a copy of his JAR, since I [b]knew[/b] his worked, since he was playing. Same thing.

I then forced Minecraft to do a clean update, then put in my backed up JAR. Still same thing.

Do note that there was one period of time during all of this where I [b]was[/b] able to connect. However, within 5-7 seconds (timed it with a stopwatch), I would lock up and black screen. Every time. It started doing this on the second try with one of the JARs. However, after trying it 3 times, with it locking up a few seconds in, it started going back to the not-even-getting-into-game lockup blackscreen.

I tried again this morning, and the same thing. Any ideas as to why it is doing this to me? Note that throughout all of this, my friends are able to connect and play on the server fine. I have not tried with any other server yet.[/QUOTE]

Any thoughts? Still having this issue. :saddowns:</span>

You do know that handing copies of minecraft&#39;s jars is against the terms of use for minecraft as stated in the following pargraph
[quote=Terms of Use]The One Major Rule

Do not distribute anything we&#39;ve made. This includes, but not limited to, the client or the server software for the game. This also includes modified versions of anything we&#39;ve made. [/quote]

Either way I doubt anyone gives a damn, but you&#39;re better off safe than sorry, same goes to your friend who had handed you his jar.

I didn&#39;t ask for you to discuss &quot;the rules of Minecraft.&quot; I&#39;m sure that it is a violation of rules somewhere, but right now, I have more pressing matters, such as not being able to play on my own damn server.

Do you think we can save the rule discussion for until [b]after[/b] we see if there is anything we can do regarding my issue? Thanks. :buddy:</span>
