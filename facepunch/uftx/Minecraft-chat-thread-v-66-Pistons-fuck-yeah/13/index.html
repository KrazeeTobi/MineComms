                            <span v-pre>this is probably a really dumb question, but i got bored and felt like messing with redstone and got caught up in a problem. 

when the circuit of your redstone is quite big, for example like [url=http://www.1337upload.net/files/38Untitled-1.png]this[/url], how do i keep the power going and make it still usable by one lever?</span>

This is just a hunch, but I think it is to do with higher end computers mainly.

I say this because I&#39;ve heard of this error a lot, but never experienced it on my laptop.

Also, Youtube commentators seem to get it too. Simon, from the yogscast got it quite a bit on this setup

- Intel Core i5 2500K 3.30GHz Sandybridge Processor
- ATI Radeon HD 6870 Graphics
- 4GB Ram - Usually Corsair or G-Skill
- 4TB Hard Drive Space, usually 2x 2TB Samsung Spinpoints
- Gigabyte or Asus Motherboards
- Corsair 650W Power Supply
- 2 24&quot; Widescreen Monitors, one 16:10 Dell and one 16:9 one Samsung.

SlyFox also seems to be getting crashing issues lately, and he&#39;s actually upgraded his PC recently too, and I never noticed any crashes on his old PC.

Pbat had crashing issues too, not sure of his specs though.

At 1:32 I show the pressure plate piston thing. The outside face with all the redstone torches on that you see at 0:44 is the backs of those things, on the inside is just a sheer drop into the lava trap below next to the pressure plates. So each of the buildings has 4 grids (2 in each half of the building, facing inwards to each other with a dividing wall to stop them from falling on opposite pads and dying,) of the contraption at 1:32. The mobs spawn on the pressure pad and are instantly pushed into the lava trap below (although more than a few levels up they are sure to die from the fall)

So as soon as the mobs spawn, they are pushed to their death into the lava trap, either from the fall or the lava. The items are then just carried by streams to the collection point.

As for use on a server
1. It&#39;s definitely impossible to build that legit (or at least, it will take you several solid years of gameplay)
2. It&#39;s complete overkill - You would never need this many items. I&#39;d just build it with one building maybe 1/4 of the size of one of the 16 buildings in the video and it would still get at least a couple of thousand items / hour."
