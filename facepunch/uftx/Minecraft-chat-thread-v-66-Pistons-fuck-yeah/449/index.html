*large image*

You&#39;re not changing the whole file white, are you? The eyes file is an overlay over the whole enderman texture, so you can have any part of the enderman glowing (or have the eyes anywhere).[/QUOTE]

No, im only zooming in (Using MS paint), using the fill tool to paint the eyes a very light grey, zooming out, saving then done. I dont touch the background.

Although i do notice that the picture loses its transparency for no reason i can imagine when i try to save it. I think thats the problem.

Regardless, mind uploading that enderman_eyes.png for me?"

*large image*

You&#39;re not changing the whole file white, are you? The eyes file is an overlay over the whole enderman texture, so you can have any part of the enderman glowing (or have the eyes anywhere).[/QUOTE]

No, im only zooming in (Using MS paint), using the fill tool to paint the eyes a very light grey, zooming out, saving then done. I dont touch the background.

Although i do notice that the picture loses its transparency for no reason i can imagine when i try to save it. I think thats the problem.

Regardless, mind uploading that enderman_eyes.png for me?</span>

Mobs only spawn within 15 chunks, or 240x240 blocks if you. So if your mineshaft is more than 240 blocks away from your &quot;XP farm fort&quot; then they won&#39;t spawn there. And even if you are close enough to it, only roughly 80 hostile mobs can exist at once, and if they can spawn all around you, they won&#39;t spawn there exclusively unless its the best place around to spawn."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=tinhead50;33841398]Mobs only spawn within 15 chunks, or 240x240 blocks if you. So if your mineshaft is more than 240 blocks away from your &quot;XP farm fort&quot; then they won&#39;t spawn there. And even if you are close enough to it, only roughly 80 hostile mobs can exist at once, and if they can spawn all around you, they won&#39;t spawn there exclusively unless its the best place around to spawn.[/QUOTE]
 
So how could I improve my farm?</span>

Well, if you just want the items, you can make one of these: [url]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSHHRSoMOME[/url]

But, if you want to kill the mobs yourself, I suggest building something like the above, minus what kills the mobs, and just having it all go to one central spot so you can kill them safely."

A simple video showing some videos and screenshots I captured during the settling of Eternal Island in the Ancient World server. Most of you won&#39;t find this too interesting. But those of you who were actually there and were a part of it might appreciate the screenshots and video.

Eternal Island is a unique landmass to the south-west of the map. Before being settled it was a harsh landscape with a strangely large amount of monsters and low amount of animals. It was also covered with old ancient ruins full of treasures and deep secret dungeons filled with deadly traps and big rewards. To this date some of these ruins and dungeons are undiscovered, but most of Eternal Island is now settled by the faction &quot;The Ancients&quot;."

After doing so, I finishing it, I decided to do some mineshaft exploring for about 3 hours.
When I returned, there were only about 2 skeletons in the area. I mean WTF.
When I climbed up onto the roof of the XP farm, I could hear them skeleton raping noises. After about 10 minutes of wonder, i went down and saw whether there were any skeletons at the bottom.
There were fuck tons of skeletons so I gained about 30 levels.
I went to my mineshaft again and proceeded mining. Went back to my XP farm, no skeletons at all. I repeated the same process.
How the fuck do I get lots of skeletons to spawn when I&#39;m not there guys?[/QUOTE]
 
There exists a &#39;mob spawner&#39; zone. When a mob spawner gets ready to spawn a mob, it will check the zone to see how many of the monster&#39;s type are in the zone (about 5-7?). If it is at the max, it won&#39;t spawn. How most traps work is that they keep the player as close to the spawners as possible but lift the mobs out of the mob spawner zone so that it can keep shooting out mobs.

How mine works is it uses a mobavator to lift them up the 22 blocks and then drops them, rather than dropping them outright."

I can&#39;t remember his name, but I can remember everyone wanted ZestyLemons to do them, and he was getting all pissy about it.
He later got perma&#39;d for wanting to leave, but then he said in the RC that he meant he was leaving the mc threads. He never got unbanned. :v:
