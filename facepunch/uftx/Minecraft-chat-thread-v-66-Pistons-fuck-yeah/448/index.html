[quote]After encountering a weird instance with textures, I successfully replicate it after restarting minecraft. This may be a result of the Mob Bike mod under particular conditions, or could potentially affect Minecraft in general, but in any case, these results can be replicated for me reliably under the same conditions every time.[/quote]

He did a &quot;replicate the result&quot; follow-up.

[quote]After encountering a weird instance with textures, I successfully replicate it after restarting minecraft. This may be a result of the Mob Bike mod under particular conditions, or could potentially affect Minecraft in general, but in any case, these results can be replicated for me reliably under the same conditions every time.[/quote]

[QUOTE=johnlmonkey;33792450]Is that texture pack the 32x Faithful Pack?[/QUOTE]
 
No, it is the &quot;Traditional Beauty&quot; texture pack. Keeps the aspect of vanilla minecraft textures but with some updated bits.

[QUOTE=johnlmonkey;33792450]Is that texture pack the 32x Faithful Pack?[/QUOTE]
 
No, it is the &quot;Traditional Beauty&quot; texture pack. Keeps the aspect of vanilla minecraft textures but with some updated bits.

FP could do things like what the FyreUK guys do, but you&#39;d have to make it just as exclusive, with one or two central leaders and the others would have to be able to listen and accept the guidelines the leaders put out, but also agree with them. That is what makes the FyreUK team so great. While there are two central guys, the rest of them think alike, which makes builds with highly complex details a lot easier to do.

A server would also be an issue, but obviously that is secondary to the first, major problem."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=ManningQB18;33838565]Yeah, it&#39;s that, plus we&#39;re a lot less exclusive than FyreUK, and get tons of griefers almost immediately. I think that if we had a creative server with about a minimum of five people on at all times working from one central plan, it could be done. Then there would need to be LogBlock as well. We could also speed it up a ton with worldedit.

But at that point, we are identical to every other creative server out there.[/QUOTE]
 
FP could do things like what the FyreUK guys do, but you&#39;d have to make it just as exclusive, with one or two central leaders and the others would have to be able to listen and accept the guidelines the leaders put out, but also agree with them. That is what makes the FyreUK team so great. While there are two central guys, the rest of them think alike, which makes builds with highly complex details a lot easier to do.

A server would also be an issue, but obviously that is secondary to the first, major problem.</span>

Oh god, who was it that was trying adamant about making the sewers?
I can&#39;t remember his name, but I can remember everyone wanted ZestyLemons to do them, and he was getting all pissy about it.
He later got perma&#39;d for wanting to leave, but then he said in the RC that he meant he was leaving the mc threads. He never got unbanned. :v:

If we did anything, we&#39;d probably want it less of a player city and more of a artistic city. But, definitely the multiple cities on Profan&#39;s servers attest that FP can do some decent stuff.

I think a player city is more repreentative of the FP community, IMO, and its a lot more fun, playing around with everything, creating plays at the theatre, telling bad jokes at the comedy club, etc. Thats what we really need, a large FP community that we can just dick around in."

I think the idea is we already have those, along with most every single MC community around. But, there aren&#39;t that many &quot;professional,&quot; &quot;skilled,&quot; or whatever-you&#39;d-like-to-call-it building communities beyond FyreUK and a couple others. But again, it harkens back to the original premise. Often times communities mix and you have those who dick around and just get on to not really build much, but more mess around. Then you have the actual builders who rarely band together because half the time they get together with those who don&#39;t care to follow through with one big build, let alone dozens of mega-builds. That is what really makes the FyreUK group unique, in my opinion. They all want to build artistic creations over and over again, and not give up half-way through.

[QUOTE=johnlmonkey;33840393]We have many communities, and they all run quite differently. This would be one giant megacity for all players. I like the idea, and with Open Trail falling apart Inacio and I could definitely jump on board and we could probably get a server for it. Thats what we really need to get a project like Punchopolis running, a team of trusted, respected, experienced admins, who know what they&#39;re doing. We want this to be all inclusive for FP members, an artistic server would restrict that.[/QUOTE]

Just gonna put this here, no sense posting again.

This is just me, but I feel that defeat the whole point of getting together and making a building community. Certainly the FP community has died down a good bit over the last two months, but all-in-one servers don&#39;t please any one crowd completely. The artistic builders like myself just get annoyed by griefers, unpleasant sights close to their buildings, and a lack of solid support if they want to work with others. That isn&#39;t to say a community like you talk about is bad, but such a community potentially isn&#39;t the right one in this situation. Again, that is just my thinking. Additionally, and I mean no offense by this, but if your community is falling apart, and you&#39;d run this one, why wouldn&#39;t it fall apart again as well?

All I&#39;d like to see, if FP ever did it, is a really cool, skilled group of skilled FP builders who want to get together for the exclusive purpose of building kickass projects with other skilled FP builders."
