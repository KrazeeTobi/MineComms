And I have the industrialcraft server version in a folder named &quot;mods&quot; in the same folder as the server jar. However, every time I launch it, I get this: [code][INFO] Default game type: 0

                            <span v-pre>Does anyone know how the fuck to install the IndustrialCraft 1.8.1 server?

[url]http://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Download#Download[/url]

I have tried injecting them straight into the 1.8.1 server jar, in the order that they&#39;re listed. I even followed this video (it&#39;s for Mac, but the injection should be the same).

[media]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy84D-4FR8I[/media]

And I have the industrialcraft server version in a folder named &quot;mods&quot; in the same folder as the server jar. However, every time I launch it, I get this: [code][INFO] Default game type: 0
[SEVERE] Unexpected exception

I have tried four times now, and it&#39;s really starting to piss me off.</span>

[QUOTE]	Pure, and stunning white. It was all that stretched in every direction for miles; a pure, piercingly bright white sand. I awoke with a ringing in my ears, and the sun fixed high in the sky. There was nothing I could do but move, anywhere away from the desert. But I could not find a path. No definite exit from the dry pit I had found myself in. I wandered for what must have been days, when finally, on the horizon; the most beautiful landscape imaginable. Impossibly massive mountains, with shear cliff faces, probed the sky with tree topped fingers. Caves wove in and out of the cliff sides, joining in the depths of stone. As I moved closer, I found a marsh surrounding the mountains, a marsh created from massive fungal structures; giant mushrooms, plaguing the land and it&#39;s surroundings. With awe, I climbed the side of the mountain. As my hand reached for the top, an unfamiliar sound whizzed past my head; an arrow stuck into the ground beside me. Pumping with fear, I turned to find a living skeleton standing in a small cave entrance, it&#39;s empty eyes piercing through the darkness. I had no chance of survival, other then to run. As I stepped over the hill, my emotions collided; this immense and beautiful view, to be seen in such a moment of danger. But, with my pause, came great confusion; where were the arrows? And... where was this light coming from? The boney figure had given up it&#39;s chase, and taken up a new hobby; spontaneous combustion. As I watched the bones turn to ash, the sun began to set. I moved to the edge of the cliff, and took a seat. Closing my eyes, I allowed the sweet, warm sunlight to penetrate my being, and for once, I was at peace.

                        <postrender input="Is anyone else really annoyed with all these pre-releases? They take all the fun out of the real ones. 

Back in the day we had regular releases, where we would all get small hints about what would be in it, and the day it came out would all hop on to soak in all the new cool stuff that we got. These pre-releases spoil all the new stuff, so in the real release no one&#39;s really amazed with the content because at that point it&#39;s already old. If you actually want to play new content you have to do it in the PR mode which is buggy as fuck. I liked it the old way better :/

Also what&#39;s up with all this new random stuff like enchantment tables? Notch is reminding me of Lost, the way they kept introducing new things but never ironing them out and making them perfect, just getting bored of them and moving on to new things. When are we going to have books that we can finally write in? People have been asking for that for a good half a year now, how long is it going to take for him to make it. It&#39;s so little work but it would add so much to the game, just like how signs did. Although I am happy that he&#39;s working on the nether, with the castles and the nether dragons that were just announced. I just want him to properly finish one section of the game before he moves on to the next. Apparently there&#39;s going to be a 3rd dimension now, like the aether? Why? Why work on that when there&#39;s still so much to work out in the first dimension, like making a boat that works properly, or making an ocean ecosystem that involves more than just one type of fish and a useless squid creature."

                            <span v-pre>Is anyone else really annoyed with all these pre-releases? They take all the fun out of the real ones. 

Back in the day we had regular releases, where we would all get small hints about what would be in it, and the day it came out would all hop on to soak in all the new cool stuff that we got. These pre-releases spoil all the new stuff, so in the real release no one&#39;s really amazed with the content because at that point it&#39;s already old. If you actually want to play new content you have to do it in the PR mode which is buggy as fuck. I liked it the old way better :/

Also what&#39;s up with all this new random stuff like enchantment tables? Notch is reminding me of Lost, the way they kept introducing new things but never ironing them out and making them perfect, just getting bored of them and moving on to new things. When are we going to have books that we can finally write in? People have been asking for that for a good half a year now, how long is it going to take for him to make it. It&#39;s so little work but it would add so much to the game, just like how signs did. Although I am happy that he&#39;s working on the nether, with the castles and the nether dragons that were just announced. I just want him to properly finish one section of the game before he moves on to the next. Apparently there&#39;s going to be a 3rd dimension now, like the aether? Why? Why work on that when there&#39;s still so much to work out in the first dimension, like making a boat that works properly, or making an ocean ecosystem that involves more than just one type of fish and a useless squid creature.</span>

Wait until the official release then. Avoid any of the prerelease threads, and enjoy the surprise you get seeing all the neat new stuff people actually playtested and ironed the bugs out of!"
