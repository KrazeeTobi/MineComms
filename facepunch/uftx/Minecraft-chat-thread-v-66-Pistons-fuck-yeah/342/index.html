Please,  redstone is child&#39;s play. God forbid you actually have to engineer clever solutions to problems yourself. I&#39;ve never had issues making secret doors, minecart stations, combination locks, TNT traps, etc. It&#39;s really not hard. It&#39;s logic.

sorry mate but this is one of the dumbest things I have read in this thread

admittedly I have only looked at a dozen or so pages of this thread, but my point still stands.

you are legitimately saying I&#39;m a crybaby for saying jeb is a cunt for refusing what is basically fixing one of the core gameplay elements in the game, as opposed to shovelling in more and more unrefined things that will never be fixed. luckily not everyone has the same fucked up mindset you do otherwise minecraft would literally be a pile of untested features dumped on eachother. it&#39;s not the most polished game as it is but it&#39;s better than that because people who give a shit (and aren&#39;t sycophants like you apparently) point out things they&#39;d like to be improved

get over yourself

the most pathetic part of your post is this ISN&#39;T a big deal. He already has all the code that would allow vertical redstone to be possible, and allowing the player to specify redstone direction would be a walk in the park as well. the point is they are legitimately ignoring this over trinkets, when all I want is to be able to make a door without building a warehouse of wire running around itself. I mean the fact that wire connects automatically means you automatically have to have partitions between wires from the get-go which means that right off that bat your project has expanded 2-3 times in size, not to mention the spiral staircases you have to make just to get a wire a few blocks up."

                        <postrender input="[QUOTE=CheeseMan;32722058]sorry mate but this is one of the dumbest things I have read in this thread

admittedly I have only looked at a dozen or so pages of this thread, but my point still stands.

you are legitimately saying I&#39;m a crybaby for saying jeb is a cunt for refusing what is basically fixing one of the core gameplay elements in the game, as opposed to shovelling in more and more unrefined things that will never be fixed. luckily not everyone has the same fucked up mindset you do otherwise minecraft would literally be a pile of untested features dumped on eachother. it&#39;s not the most polished game as it is but it&#39;s better than that because people who give a shit (and aren&#39;t sycophants like you apparently) point out things they&#39;d like to be improved

get over yourself

the most pathetic part of your post is this ISN&#39;T a big deal. He already has all the code that would allow vertical redstone to be possible, and allowing the player to specify redstone direction would be a walk in the park as well. the point is they are legitimately ignoring this over trinkets, when all I want is to be able to make a door without building a warehouse of wire running around itself. I mean the fact that wire connects automatically means you automatically have to have partitions between wires from the get-go which means that right off that bat your project has expanded 2-3 times in size, not to mention the spiral staircases you have to make just to get a wire a few blocks up.[/QUOTE]

I just want to stop you at &quot;Will never be fixed&quot;, because that seems to be what you&#39;re basing your rant off of. You don&#39;t seem to realize that we&#39;re in an alpha posing as a beta before the finalization of features and the polishing stage. The &quot;real&quot; beta begins on the 18th, when Mojang begins ironing out all the bugs before the November launch. We&#39;re in the cram period where they&#39;re adding everything they didn&#39;t get to add in Alpha because Notch was always on holiday. 

The only reason the game went into Beta was because of it&#39;s explosion in popularity. Had that not happened, Alpha would have lasted at least two or three more years, if not longer. 

However, hope is not lost. We&#39;ll have plenty more features beginning January 2012, as Notch will resume development on more content and patches for Minecraft.

That said, I do want vertical redstone and such. It&#39;d make it much more useful. Still, it&#39;s not meant to be the whole game, only a small feature, so I say it&#39;s good enough as it is. For now."

Well, I don&#39;t particularly mind as much as my post says I do. 

What I&#39;m really finding more issue with isn&#39;t the fact that these things aren&#39;t in the game, or even the prospect that they never will... But more the fact that from what I heard Jeb actively refused to polish something that needs polishing, probably because he was too busy making yet another feature that in a few months would probably meet the same fate of being pushed under the rug to make room for The Ender/The Skyworld/Fairy Universe. That&#39;s more my issue, and I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m justified in thinking that considering this is not the first time core problems have been ignored to add new things. 

So yeah, my beef&#39;s with their attitudes and not with the game.

Hey guys, I&#39;ve been playing around in modding Minecraft directly (IE, directly editing the classes), and I feel like I&#39;m ready to play around with creating mods that use Modloader and Minecraft Forge, to make them compatible with other mods.

I was asking my friends for ideas of things to try out making, when a friend suggested programmable redstone circuits. I hunted down a video showing off the programmable Redstone Gates to show it&#39;s already been done, but reading the comments, I saw an idea that interested me.

Referred to as &quot;bluestone,&quot; the basic idea was a dust that was identical in every way and operation to redstone dust, but did not make connections to redstone dust, so you could make two non-interfering circuits run parallel to each other.

I really liked the idea and decided to look into it some more, and all I&#39;ve found is a year-old idea thread for it that had a lot of support, but as far as I can tell, no one ever picked it up. I&#39;ve been considering picking it up myself, but I want to know if anyone else has done it already.

So, does anyone know if anyone has already picked up the idea, or done something similar to it?"

Checked both the twitter link you posted and the reddit. Reddit one isn&#39;t by Notch (Notch&#39;s reddit is xNotch). Only C418 posted there talking about music.
