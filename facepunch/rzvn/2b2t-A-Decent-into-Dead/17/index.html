It is one thing to use a hacked client and xray and esps, but to be able to gets coords of every player online destroys the game.

Its not a hack ffs. you dont just have specific coords spit out at you. you have to take the time to change the /tell radius range and zero in on a player. it takes time. and autism. it is, however, a vulnerability on mojangs part; players/non OP&#39;s shouldnt have access to @ selectors"

Hause, stop being retarded. No one was using /me except him.
No one was using /tell today except him and tristan.

I can only blame him because he is the only one doing.
If someone did this... We are not aware of that... But popbob yes, we are almost sure he been using this. He is the kind of aspie that looks for new exploits and bypasses for this blocky game everyday on his doritos filled keyboard kek

You better than anyone should know what popbob is capable of.

popbob destroyed Fenrir last week. Then Rebellion one day after. Then Balonypony base a couple days after by jared and taylo I think.

And jared/taylo/popbob are working together on this apparent base hunt.

You&#39;re really dumb for blaming any player especially a single player for an exploit anyone can use in a multiplayer game with millions players. It&#39;s like you think 2b2t is literally the only minecraft server that exists

And you&#39;re all fucking stupid for trying to figure out who to blame for what exploit instead of blaming mojang"

You&#39;re really dumb for blaming any player especially a single player for an exploit anyone can use in a multiplayer game with millions players. It&#39;s like you think 2b2t is literally the only minecraft server that exists

You clearly didn&#39;t read anything I said.
I&#39;ll make it simple for you

Anyone could have used this? Yes.
We saw someone using it besides popbob and company? No
Bases were rekt during the two last weeks by popbob and company? Yes
Is this exploit popbob fault? No. I know its not. Its Mojang fault.
popbob and company been using it to find people&#39;s bases? Most likely

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=ColdWave;47835586]I was trying to put it across to the disbelievers that the exploit is real[/QUOTE]
 
Or maybe it is real because the server is apparently down just because of it (I don&#39;t know how long)

[QUOTE=Sato;47835607]You clearly didn&#39;t read anything I said. [/QUOTE]
 
What does it matter who used what exploit? What the fuck is the point. If there is a known exploit, you can be pretty sure anyone has most likely abused it in any server and it is absolutely pointless blaming anyone or giving anyone attention</span>
