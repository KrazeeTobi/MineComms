Is this your way of deflecting criticism?

No one is rustled (at least not I or Sonador), people are just laughing at how ridiculous others are in this thread. This isn&#39;t your forum. You don&#39;t make the rules. You can follow them or get banned - easy as that.

I&#39;m breaking this down for you guys to understand because there is no other option. I&#39;m lending my hand out for you guys - you guys keep complaining and keep the thread rolling on this path. I&#39;m not trying to be a backseat moderator, nor am I hyped up on this. I&#39;m legitimately just telling you guys how things work."

No one is rustled (at least not I or Sonador), people are just laughing at how ridiculous others are in this thread. This isn&#39;t your forum. You don&#39;t make the rules. You can follow them or get banned - easy as that.

No, you really are trying to be a moderator. I bet you eat a big bowl of shit for breakfast every day to start your day of whiteknighting this circlejerk.

Seriously, stop replying.

This is a thread about 2b2t. Anyone who is not willing to discuss about the server, please leave.
Like it or not, facepunch represents an important part of 2b2t history.
This forum holds most of the server memories. Text, Images, videos.

Newcomers/Observers will find it strange.
But that&#39;s because we are strange. That&#39;s it.
2b2t Community is based on anarchy, edgyness and autism. If you read the past threads, you&#39;ll notice that hundreds of users been banned/permabanned.
But new users will always join the 2b2t threads as well as old ones coming back.

So yeah... If this keeps on, the thread will be closed. And we just got on page 16 now.

So please, shut the fuck up.
With love, Sato."

I played 2b2t a long time ago, I know how it is.
Fact is you guys were acting weird and being shitters, so you got banned for it. Everyone else was fine with it, your lot are the only ones that are upset about not being able to be shitlords on a forum you&#39;re apparantley not used to posting on. You don&#39;t have to integrate into the rest of the community if all you&#39;re doing is posting here, but the rules are the rules, garry doesn&#39;t give two shits, and lets his moderators moderate as they see fit. If this &quot;one little stain&quot; is important to you, then you&#39;d oblige the rules. If there&#39;s something about it that you don&#39;t agree with, then go hang out in a different stain that suits your posting style."
