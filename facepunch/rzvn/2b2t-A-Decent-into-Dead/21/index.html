Signatures? Green texting? General shitposting? Have any of you been to other parts of the forums? You&#39;re being banned because you&#39;re acting like this is /b/, which is very much not appreciated on this forum. It falls under the &quot;no shitposting&quot; rule which you guys are rightfully being banned under. Quit bitching about the mods, get back on topic, and stop acting like a pack of idiots.[/QUOTE]

lmao jesus christ you really have not a fucking clue as to where you are and the people or the nature of the people that comprise this thread.

What the fuck motivates these outsiders to even click these threads? They obviously don&#39;t play on 2b2t, because if they did, they would have had their fill of what they can handle and definitely would not seek out to further integrate with the 2b2t community.

Also it&#39;s ironic that you&#39;re bringing up medieval references considering how hard you&#39;re trying to fucking whiteknight this thread."

lmao jesus christ you really have not a fucking clue as to where you are and the people or the nature of the people that comprise this thread.

What the fuck motivates these outsiders to even click these threads? They obviously don&#39;t play on 2b2t, because if they did, they would have had their fill of what they can handle and definitely would not seek out to further integrate with the 2b2t community.

Also it&#39;s ironic that you&#39;re bringing up medieval references considering how hard you&#39;re trying to fucking whiteknight this thread.</span>

No one is feeling as strongly about the forum as you guys in the thread. I&#39;m literally trying to be nice when I say you guys have to chill out. There is no other way about it. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;re dangerously close to getting banned"
