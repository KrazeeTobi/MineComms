The year is 2015, Mass riots, suicides and destruction is widespread, the cause? Unknown. One man takes it upon himself to find out and correct the widespread panic that has been caused by a unknown source, and the rabbit hole he has to follow, only goes deeper..

Coming to a cinema near you! 

But seriously, any word on why it&#39;s down? Pretty sure June isn&#39;t for another 20 odd days, and May should have filled Hause&#39;s quota for blow and hookers. Maybe we are finally getting withers back? :D"

The year is 2015, Mass riots, suicides and destruction is widespread, the cause? Unknown. One man takes it upon himself to find out and correct the widespread panic that has been caused by a unknown source, and the rabbit hole he has to follow, only goes deeper..

Coming to a cinema near you! 

But seriously, any word on why it&#39;s down? Pretty sure June isn&#39;t for another 20 odd days, and May should have filled Hause&#39;s quota for blow and hookers. Maybe we are finally getting withers back? :D</span>

We are still here. SIB construction doesn&#39;t stop. All lavacasts they brought been TNTed and removed completely. The gigantic structure of the base is almost done, the roof is complete, now just the dome left. And maybe some other minor decorations and additions. Wrath is already one of the 2b2t greatests wonders and the most autistic spawn base ever built. Its the proof of what we are capable to build and hold and of what players can do when they work together in this server... The Incursion goal has already been reached.

Spawn is patrolled everyday, all the time.

My sword collection is growing each day.
Let them keep coming... So we can have their loot.

Now let me tell you why that is bullshit.
You confuse intelligence with arrogance. You judge others without knowing them. 
You think to know what 2b2t is all about. Bigots and swastikas right? 

You see, 2b2t is a free territory. People there don&#39;t have the eyes of society to judge them from whatever they say or do. Pretty much like 4chan.
Its a playground basically. You can act the way you want. Say whatever bullshit you want. Build whatever you want.
Most of the &quot;bigotry&quot; you think to know on this server its just a result of elaborated baits and edgy behavior.

I personally would let people build swastikas on Valkyria, because it was part of 2b2t, thanks to 4chan. Hinder made most of them. He put a big one made of obsidian on his building with two giant cumming penises on top. Swastikas and penises. Thats right. There your bigots. 

Its all a joke. But you don&#39;t seem to be intelligent enough to realize that.
I do believe there are like 2 or 3 actual bigots on 2b2t, but they are a minority, just like you.

Valkyria was the only place on this server where different people with different views would base together to build amazing stuff and achieve amazing deeds. It was, in a fucking long time, the first sign of a more mature community on 2b2t after all the years of intense griefing and edgyness. There, even people that had problems with each other made peace for the best of the group. Even I had to forgive a couple stuff from some so we could have a good healthy relation with each other (In pvp, I only died to 3 people so far. 2 of them were at Valk). It still holds the record of the most populated base on 2b2t with 38 members. But you insulted all that progress by griefing the ruins and making a video judging the people there without knowing both them and the server history.  Since Valkyria, people been trying to keep that spirit alive, because its the best 2b2t can have right now. 

The results of this community spirit is at all the bases that carried (and some that still carry) that eagle

Eagles that now also rests on each one of your rekt bases. 

You should have taken x0XP advice while you still could.
