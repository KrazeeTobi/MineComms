[url]https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-40319[/url]

&#39;This is very much an issue, even in 1.7.4. It&#39;s now become impossible to play survival without risk of players or griefers finding out exactly where you are. It doesn&#39;t stop with @a, either. @r and @p work just as well. Players have been abusing this system to triangulate players using custom strings such as @a[x=0,z=0,r=1000] or @p[x=1000,z=-2000,r=100]. Using advanced trigonometry, a player can obtain the exact cords of a player in 3 whispers. Some players have been using it as &quot;/me @p&quot; to locate the person nearest to them, broadcasting it in public chat, or even using the more advanced aspects of the command to single out more specific players. What&#39;s one of the most annoying aspects of it is that in servers with many players, it&#39;s easy to spam chat and not trip the built in spam filter, or even avoid some scripts by either whispering a message using &quot;/w @a @a&quot; or sending a message in public chat by using &quot;/me @a&quot;.&#39;

Also James_Rustles tested it minutes before the server shut. It works. He got your coords and someone else. He notified hause (which made him shut the server) and showed him a recording of him doing it.

You love calling me paranoid. 
But everyone knows you are the real cancer here.

&#39;This is very much an issue, even in 1.7.4. It&#39;s now become impossible to play survival without risk of players or griefers finding out exactly where you are. It doesn&#39;t stop with @a, either. @r and @p work just as well. Players have been abusing this system to triangulate players using custom strings such as @a[x=0,z=0,r=1000] or @p[x=1000,z=-2000,r=100]. Using advanced trigonometry, a player can obtain the exact cords of a player in 3 whispers. Some players have been using it as &quot;/me @p&quot; to locate the person nearest to them, broadcasting it in public chat, or even using the more advanced aspects of the command to single out more specific players. What&#39;s one of the most annoying aspects of it is that in servers with many players, it&#39;s easy to spam chat and not trip the built in spam filter, or even avoid some scripts by either whispering a message using &quot;/w @a @a&quot; or sending a message in public chat by using &quot;/me @a&quot;.&#39;

Also James_Rustles tested it minutes before the server shut. It works. He got your coords and someone else. He notified hause (which made him shut the server) and showed him a recording of him doing it.

You love calling me paranoid. 
But everyone knows you are the real cancer here.



I know that. But Tristan and popbob are the ones doing it right when I joined the server. They been spamming /tell for a while.

A2, Fenrir, Rebellion (A base with no portals and tunnels), the unfindable pony/coco base and even maybe Ore/Ian base could have been caught on this exploit. They might been using it for months. But probably decided to go all out now since mojang is aware of the exploit.

So they decided its better to just spam everyone and end the low profile operation so they can get as many coords as they can while it still lasts.

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=Sato;47835255]A2, Fenrir, Rebellion (A base with no portals and tunnels), the unfindable pony/coco base and even maybe Ore/Ian base could have been caught on this exploit. They might been using it for months. But probably decided to go all out now since mojang is aware of the exploit.

So they decided its better to just spam everyone and end the low profile operation so they can get as many coords as they can while it still lasts.
