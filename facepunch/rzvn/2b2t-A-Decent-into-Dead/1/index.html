2b2t is the longest running and largest minecraft world ever made. There are no rules, no staff, and infinite possibility, in a completely vanilla setting. The world (at the time of writing this) is 787GB large and 49 months old (19 Jan 2015) and nearly 60,000 players have wandered the world at least once. The server will continue to grow and age as long as the community pays $90 monthy to maintain it. If you&#39;re someone who loves to explore, discover and create this is the server for you, there are a multitude of bases, forms of terrain to explore, and (thanks to a few dozen exploits, and even one back-door over the years) plenty of OP gear, loot, and resources to steal, provided you&#39;re lucky and persistent enough to go out there and find it. At peak times the server has around thirty players on, some are friendly, most are deadly. 

Facepunch was also part of its history, as proven on this threads: [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1083343&quot;]Here[/URL], [URL=&quot;http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1105156&quot;]Here[/URL] [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1160481&quot;]Here[/URL], [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1174308&quot;]Here[/URL], [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1250221&amp;page=33&quot;]Here[/URL] and [URL=&quot;http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1418046&quot;]Here[/URL].

In 27th April of 2011, Chezhead attempted to make a Facepunch Republic in the server, however he startled most of the 4chan playerbase in the process. Because of this, the Republic never happened, being sabotaged over and over again by infiltrated players and griefers. But things have changed... 2b2t is currently in a era of peace. Griefers and griefings have decreased in number through the years. Because of this, bases like Valkyria, Gape, Asgard, Nova and Fenrir were able to happen. Playing in 2b2t is not just playing minecraft. This server is the ultimate minecraft online experience. No rules. No Admins. Welcome to Minecraft Hell.

The server was also inspiration for the Player Judge Holden to make a Comic about it:

There is also[URL=&quot;http://the2b2t.blogspot.com.br/&quot;]The 2b2t Blog[/URL], done by James_Rustles, who collects stories of the server and even some of his own.

Getting out of spawn is always a hard task, no matter when you log in. The server is filled with ruins of the past. Destroyed bases, homes and towns. Don&#39;t expect to survive in the first try.

The IP is 2b2t.org. Good luck, try not to die too much.

Here is what other facepunchers said about 2b2t on the older threads:

[QUOTE]Chezhead posted:
2b2t is a server I find very interesting. It&#39;s basically an open, public server with no rules whatsoever. No admins, no plugins, no anything. This makes it a pvp free for all.
Many communities are invited to this cesspool of a server, including Something Awful, 4chan, and our own Facepunch.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Within posted:
Terminologically correct it is an anarchy server. 2b2t is the only server out there true to Minecraft&#39;s gamemode: survival. It&#39;s the only server not infested by idiot-cunt-kid admins fucking up the server with every Bukkit plugin out there. The server is completely vanilla with the exception of the Bukkit plugin NoCheat. There are no admins, no moderators, no OPs, no bans, no kicks, no punishment, no rules, no nothing. It&#39;s up to you to survive. And that&#39;s why we like it.
People from all over the Internet has adventured (and is still adventuring): from Facepunch, /b/, /v/, Reddit, SA and even DeviantART.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]IliekBoxes posted:
We&#39;re all equally worthless on this server. Nobody cares if you are raped, your base is destroyed, your friends betray you and your shit is stolen.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Phagocitic posted:
2b2t provides a very unique experience to players both new and old to Minecraft. On average, there are usually about 40 or so players on at once, so you can easily make new friends (or enemies). There are ruins of old bases fucking everywhere, so if you are the kind of person who loves to explore, 2b2t is for you. Because there are no rules, if you&#39;re the type of person to spam chat with racism or grief any base in sight, you can do it to your heart&#39;s desire. And if you are just generally bored, hop on 2b2t, there&#39;s always an interesting conversation going on.[/QUOTE]

2b2t is a server I find very interesting. It&#39;s basically an open, public server with no rules whatsoever. No admins, no plugins, no anything. This makes it a pvp free for all.
Many communities are invited to this cesspool of a server, including Something Awful, 4chan, and our own Facepunch.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Within posted:
Terminologically correct it is an anarchy server. 2b2t is the only server out there true to Minecraft&#39;s gamemode: survival. It&#39;s the only server not infested by idiot-cunt-kid admins fucking up the server with every Bukkit plugin out there. The server is completely vanilla with the exception of the Bukkit plugin NoCheat. There are no admins, no moderators, no OPs, no bans, no kicks, no punishment, no rules, no nothing. It&#39;s up to you to survive. And that&#39;s why we like it.
People from all over the Internet has adventured (and is still adventuring): from Facepunch, /b/, /v/, Reddit, SA and even DeviantART.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]IliekBoxes posted:
We&#39;re all equally worthless on this server. Nobody cares if you are raped, your base is destroyed, your friends betray you and your shit is stolen.[/QUOTE]
[QUOTE]Phagocitic posted:
2b2t provides a very unique experience to players both new and old to Minecraft. On average, there are usually about 40 or so players on at once, so you can easily make new friends (or enemies). There are ruins of old bases fucking everywhere, so if you are the kind of person who loves to explore, 2b2t is for you. Because there are no rules, if you&#39;re the type of person to spam chat with racism or grief any base in sight, you can do it to your heart&#39;s desire. And if you are just generally bored, hop on 2b2t, there&#39;s always an interesting conversation going on.[/QUOTE]
Here is a compilation of screenshots and images from older 2b2t threads(Some images comes with explanation):

You see, [B]this thread[/B] is fine. [B]This thread [/B]is in the correct section. Too bad they locked it and banned OP as soon as it was made, for posting it in the wrong section when it never was in the wrong section. So I made the topic in what I thought was the correct section, but then it got locked for being in the wrong section. Then sato made a new thread cause my was locked with no explanation, then his was locked and he was banned for posting in the wrong section. Than this thread was re-opened for being in the correct section which it already was all along!

So I made the topic in what I thought was the correct section, but then it got locked for being in the wrong section. Then sato made a new thread cause my was locked with no explanation, then his was locked and he was banned for posting in the wrong section. Than this thread was re-opened for being in the correct section which it already was all along!

lol i dunno how you even managed to get shit that wrong but for clarity sake here&#39;s what actually happened:

This thread was never locked, nor was it originally posted in the right section. This is the server forum, it&#39;s where server threads go. Not the general games discussion forum which is where you discuss games. When dino made this thread in the games forum, we banned him for posting in the wrong section then moved the thread here so discussion could still continue. Then for some silly reason you guys kept spamming new duplicate threads back in the section we just moved his thread from lol. Threads do get locked for a reason, idk why you guys kept just remaking the exact same thread in the exact same section then acted surprised when it started to get you banned but regardless keep it to this thread from now on, and also learn to use the event log icons listed next to your flag icon and to also just contact moderators if you&#39;re really unsure about why we&#39;re doing something so confusion like this can be avoided.

When I checked this thread OP was banned, thread [B]was[/B] locked, and located in this section. I guess I checked it at a wrong time then.. I&#39;m certain this thread was locked at one point or another.

We recreated threads because this one was locked, and our other threads were locked [B]with no explanation[/B]. Thanks for clearing it up but you need to lock with explanations so we know why it was locked in the first place. I had to email FP staff to know why they were locked and to find out what was going on."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=postal;46975153]lol i dunno how you even managed to get shit that wrong but for clarity sake here&#39;s what actually happened:

This thread was never locked, nor was it originally posted in the right section. This is the server forum, it&#39;s where server threads go. Not the general games discussion forum which is where you discuss games. When dino made this thread in the games forum, we banned him for posting in the wrong section then moved the thread here so discussion could still continue. Then for some silly reason you guys kept spamming new duplicate threads back in the section we just moved his thread from lol. Threads do get locked for a reason, idk why you guys kept just remaking the exact same thread in the exact same section then acted surprised when it started to get you banned but regardless keep it to this thread from now on, and also learn to use the event log icons listed next to your flag icon and to also just contact moderators if you&#39;re really unsure about why we&#39;re doing something so confusion like this can be avoided.

When I checked this thread OP was banned, thread [B]was[/B] locked, and located in this section. I guess I checked it at a wrong time then.. I&#39;m certain this thread was locked at one point or another.

We recreated threads because this one was locked, and our other threads were locked [B]with no explanation[/B]. Thanks for clearing it up but you need to lock with explanations so we know why it was locked in the first place. I had to email FP staff to know why they were locked and to find out what was going on.</span>

Then you were looking at the wrong thread. Again, use the event log. This thread was literally never locked, only moved to the right section at the same time that the ban was given.

The ban reason on Sato did explain it, and your thread got locked for the reason &#39;duplicate&#39; which also explained that one. The only thread that was just locked was the original 2b2t thread, but we then just moved the next one that got made to the right section so again I really don&#39;t think it should&#39;ve been an issue if you guys weren&#39;t in such a hurry to quickly make more threads.

Why were you using email?? This forum has a private message feature like nearly any other forum. Just use that lol it&#39;ll be a lot faster. Use the event log, check who locked it, and then PM them if you&#39;re confused about something."

Like I get it hause, you don&#39;t care, or pretend to not care. But Jesus Christ if people are donating, keep your server in fucking order or at least let us know you are trying.

If you honestly don&#39;t care anymore, stop accepting donations, shut it down and release the map. Simple.[/QUOTE]
