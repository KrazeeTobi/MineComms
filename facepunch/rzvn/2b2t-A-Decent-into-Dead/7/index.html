Wow you actually found it? And here we were thinking it had never been found for 2/3 years.
The place was pretty much my main &quot;barracks&quot; for armor and G&#39;apples.
It was a really nice underground base though, rather relaxing to sit on top of the trees and stare at the 100x100 underground area whilst being an asshole in chat. 
I had plans to improve &amp; extend a lot of it too before I left.

R.I.P

Picture below for anyone interested in which base this was.

This. Minecraft servers are completely single-threaded. They&#39;re not multi-threaded at all.

For Tristan, for example, if you took a dual-core CPU and a quad-core CPU, same series/model with the same GHz, the Minecraft server would perform exactly the same on both.
Just have a high connection speed, a single high performing CPU and over 16GB of RAM. Should be good enough to run smoothly."

They also cost more than what I paid for to buy that entire server. I&#39;m not into all that game server hosting srs bznz, this is just a general purpose server that costs nothing to operate.</span>

Yes, but specifically what processor should I buy? Can I multithread the JVM? Maybe I could run the GC in another thread? You said other plugins run in other threads—one plugin I have to use is NoCheatPlus. That has caused lag in the past for 2b2t. Does it run in another thread, though?

If, for instance, I only had two cores, wouldn&#39;t lots of system processes be running on the same core as the Minecraft thread? I don&#39;t want Apache and my world renderer to get in the way of my server."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=jf3000;47357285]Have a server and host available and paid for the year, for use if still needed, specs:

CPU: Quad Intel Xeon E5 2667v2 @ 3.3ghz
RAM: 256GB DDR3
HDD: 4 x 512GB SSD (Raid), 4 x 1TB SATA (Raid)

Not sure if after reading the multiple posts if a server and host was still needed, did send someone an email but didn&#39;t get a reply.

I don&#39;t know what your world renderer is, but if it&#39;s overviewer, it&#39;s pretty trivial to assign it a thread priority of something like -19 so it has almost zero impact on other performance.

Amazing to see that the city is in such good conditions. Actually, most of the griefing in the picture were already that way when we found it. We tried to repair most of the houses, pathways, farms... The place was a mess. Wooden buildings were burned down and the inner palace was not even finished. It was only pretty on the outside, but the halls inside still had walls of dirty and stone. I had to personally finish a lot of corridors and halls. We also restores the glass top and the library, putting bookshelves on it. Worse than restore the place was the fact that we had trouble to find the story of the place. Most of the Signs were removed and we had to search a lot of hidden ones to discover who were the old owners. It was literally a archeological work. The original base name was Kyriath. 

Rhadamantis played a important role. After Valk got griefed by drew, everyone moved to Belegost. A new promising base, but Coldwave (I think) decided to test x0XP hacked client and x0 got his coords, therefore getting ours. We had to move again. Belegost didnt even lasted 2 weeks. We got stranded even more far at a mooshroom island. Thats when, travelling to spawn, I found that beautiful fortified town while exploring nether portals. Most of us (because of this point the group was already too divided and split) moved there and repaired. It was there that we met for the first time Fubster and Pompano. They gave me so much trouble on that base because of their edgyness and behavior, but I can say that my experience in this server wouldn&#39;t be complete without them, nor Valkyria, when they helped us to repair the base after the spawn incursion. Rhada was right between Valkyria first destruction and the Second Incursion.

Rhadamantis played a important role. After Valk got griefed by drew, everyone moved to Belegost. A new promising base, but Coldwave (I think) decided to test x0XP hacked client and x0 got his coords, therefore getting ours. We had to move again. Belegost didnt even lasted 2 weeks.
[/QUOTE]

Some friend of Coldwave&#39;s actually, and at that time too it was pretty obvious I&#39;d backdoored Adolf in some way, I&#39;d made it public that I did after _Aaron_ leaked an early version.

Might post Adolf src on here soon, client&#39;s dead, some people here should be able to learn from it a little, there&#39;s still a lot of bypasses/exploits very useful for 2b2t that almost nobody on 2b2t has other than spacerocket and MeckImp.
I&#39;m too busy working to care for it anymore, it was a fun project that allowed me to go from being a complete script-kiddie to now working as a Software Dev in C# and Java for a career. It&#39;s funny what a terrible server and a block game can do.

For now, here&#39;s an old copy of Adolf, the last copy released public to people back in November 2013, I&#39;m at work so I can&#39;t check if it&#39;s v1.6.2 or v1.6.4.

The funny part of that was that it wasnt a block, It was that you where both on the same ISP who bought transit with cogent. And IIRC the server&#39;s ISP at the time did as well, but one side forgot to set up their end correctly, and so connectivity between the two ISP&#39;s were broken / dropped.

Either way I solved this for you guys by putting a proxy up :)

It was quite hilarious at the time, only a few of us were unable to connect to 2b2t.
Me and popbob, at the time, couldn&#39;t find anyone else whom was unable to connect, so we both attempted to connect via a VPN, which was fine. We decided to check if just our IP&#39;s at the time were blocked, so we proceeded to change them. 
Still both unable to connect to the server, we assumed Hausemaster actually decided to block our IP ranges from connecting to 2b2t altogether to prevent us from ever being able to join again.
