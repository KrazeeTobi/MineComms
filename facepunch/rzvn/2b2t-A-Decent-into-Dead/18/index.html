It matters. You know why?
Because when someone base gets rekt in the next months/years they will have someone to blame.
Not mojang.
But popbob taylo and tristan(if that was really him on techno), which were the guys using it. (The only ones)

People need to know who to hate inside this server.
You sound like you were trying to take the blame from them. And we definitely wont allow that. 
They have our coords. And they will go after them when 2b2t gets back on. 

Taylo already confirmed he have the coords to 2-3 oremongers bases.
So yes Hause. It matters a lot.

Its like you are trying to put the guilt to the weapon and not the ones who pull the trigger.
This is a mojang bug. We get it. But they were the ones using it here. 
The players needs to know who fucked with them."

Hause, I know you say you&#39;d given up on 2b2t and don&#39;t care about it. but in the last few months you have shown that you read e-mails, occasionally reply, and have actively been trying to reduce the lag. I&#39;m thankful that you have decided to care a bit, not all the lag reducing steps have worked, and some have messed with the game.. hostile mob spawning has been horrible for months now, even with only a few users online. In any case, try not to piss off your loyal user base, if you piss off all the regulars no one will donate.. and then you say, you&#39;ll shut the server down. I ask you.. why not sell the server to someone who cares about it and will play.

The website people donated for and never received.. can you please be even a tiny bit respectable and either create a new website, or refund peoples $, or add it to the monthly donations.

2) As for people placing blame on popbob and tristan.. weren&#39;t these two of the people who discovered the thunderhack, exploited it for a good long while.. and then provided the code to fix it?
As sato mentioned I&#39;ve lost 2-3 bases because of the thunderhack and some other (perhaps this current exploit&quot;. I know this is 2b2t, I know bases don&#39;t last forever, I&#39;m all good with that. But my first base lasted 3 years and was only found because of the thunderhack, Might still be hidden today if not for that. So, it is perfectly reasonable to assume that popbob and tristan might be exploiting this and generating lists of &quot;areas&quot; and knowing their personal feelings about me, target me and get the coords to me base.

How the hell can you know for sure those are the only ones on an all public server with hundreds of players a month?

No, you are entirely supposed to blame mojang. You have to see this as just another server. This and previous various exploits worked on their game, not just this server. The servers are just hosts for the game you purchased. It is mojangs fault for releasing broken updates for their finished game. It is mojangs fault a player abused a bug they released.

Actually not sure you can blame mojang anymore though. I think they earlier officially announced that they have dropped support for public multiplayer, and that people should use Realms if they want to play multiplayer. Maybe you can try blaming bukkit. But these gamebreaking exploits work on the mojang provided server too (minecraft.net/download). So try blaming both

Sending actual proof and explanation of exploits to mojang and bukkit just might do something, but crying about it and blaming players will definitely do nothing"

You arrived at A1 and said someone leaked the coords to you. But we found later you got them through thunderhack
[/QUOTE]

Wrong, you and a few others actually disclosed the coords to that base in public. I was just the first one to find it.

Rebellion had no portals or tunnels. We had a similar base in the axis that was not found for 2 years. And you suddenly find Rebellion in a matter of 2-3 weeks.

1) You made that tunnel and portal at Rebellion.
2) You played with us during Asgard I 2 weeks before arriving, telling you were exploring  a nether coordinate that was exactly the same was A1 nether coords, but in the opposite z. You knew what you were doing. You wanted to take a reaction from us. Make us paranoid. You already had our coords through thunderhack, but you decided to play with our minds before actually go to the base
3) You been proving all my paranoias were correct. Thanks for that."

Lastly, the huge fiasco that is currently going on. A lot of you believe I have abused this a lot when I really didn&#39;t.

at the end of the day popbob and I were spamming via pm because we set our spam prefix to &quot;/tell @a&quot; which does not give us any indication of anyone&#39;s coords at all. And anyone complaining about /me is just dumb, learn to regex ignore, even &quot;v&quot; has that feature.

Yeah... No.
Rebellion had around 10-14 people. Everyone was instructed to go there through overworld. 
Afaik everyone did that, sailing from the 20k highway portal. Its 3k-5k distance in the right direction.

Why are you telling everything that was said here is a false conspiracy?
At this point, you think you are a reliable and trustful source of information?

Nothing you, popbob or taylo says cant be trusted anymore, because the three of you have mutual interest to cover the stuff you were doing and avoid the blame. 

Bases will get rekt and we are not blaming only taylo on this.

Edit: I personally removed the nether portal that lemon opened. He told me and I went there to close it. It was a portal with no tunnels in the middle of the nether. I even repaired the netherrack stair I made to return to the highway"
