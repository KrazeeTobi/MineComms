OreMonger new base destroyed. 2 days of work on the rekting.

It took you 2 days to rekt my base THIS poorly?
so sad.

[editline]28th April 2015[/editline]

Thank you for admiting I&#39;m not causing the lag...

For you information when I AFK 24/7 at a mob trap, the most mobs I could have is 150.. so I&#39;m not filling up the mob cap..

[editline]28th April 2015[/editline]

Where is asgard II now?

Rekt by the very same members who lived there.. how lame..

Ask yourself, who leaked the coords to me.. that is the question and the person you should be mad at.

[editline]29th April 2015[/editline]
Funny the week after you showed me this.. you rekt your own base.. just because a member saw me near your base.. how sad to betrayed....

And you post this picture of my rekt base as if I didn&#39;t move 15 DC of items from the base, and abandon the base 3 weeks before this happen... which ONLY happen because I gave the coords out.

You didn&#39;t kick my ass at all.. try to get back into reality[/QUOTE]
 

[QUOTE=oremonger;47621490]If you could read, you&#39;d realize I&#39;m not mad or butthurt at all..

Thanks for the welcome, it seemed some were just obsessed with me so I figured I&#39;d grace you with my presence and perhaps clear up some lies.[/QUOTE]

Honestly, someone should just tell you this already, so I will, with experience.

You&#39;re just a disliked outcast on 2b2t and it&#39;s always going to be that way no matter what you do, you could make friends with [i]some[/i] people but you&#39;ll have to always be on your guard as they will often attempt to stab you in the back.

Just leave now whilst you can, there&#39;s no point in you playing 2b2t anymore other than to annoy faggots, why do you think I left myself?
The entire community of 2b2t is cancer, exempt a few members. However those members are a part of Valkyria, with a couple not.

But for yourself? Trust nobody. Everyone you now befriend [i]will[/i] at some point stab you in the back. 
Listen to someone with experience, leave whilst you can. 2b2t&#39;s community is cancerous, defending yourself is useless once a large group all hate you."

Holy shit, it&#39;s literally just a game, if you think it&#39;s still fun, play. Obviously you got reasons not to play, but others do.

It seems like it&#39;s mostly the &quot;Valkyrians&quot; that hate Ore, not sure why.

Just leave now whilst you can, there&#39;s no point in you playing 2b2t anymore other than to annoy faggots, why do you think I left myself?
The entire community of 2b2t is cancer, exempt a few members. However those members are a part of Valkyria, with a couple not.[/QUOTE]
 
Holy shit, it&#39;s literally just a game, if you think it&#39;s still fun, play. Obviously you got reasons not to play, but others do.

It seems like it&#39;s mostly the &quot;Valkyrians&quot; that hate Ore, not sure why.

[QUOTE=x0XP;47623449]But for yourself? Trust nobody. Everyone you now befriend [i]will[/i] at some point stab you in the back. 
Listen to someone with experience, leave whilst you can. 2b2t&#39;s community is cancerous, defending yourself is useless.[/QUOTE]

It all depends though, obviously people can trust different people, that&#39;s for sure, however I wouldn&#39;t trust them in general.
The only person I&#39;d trust with anything on 2b2t is xcc2, that&#39;s it, nobody else. I&#39;d tell anyone they can do the same too, if they&#39;re friends. Almost every other person that played the server I can recall at least one time they have backstabbed someone when that person has trusted them with some form of information, no matter how small it is and nobody can deny it.

tl;dr - the entire community attempts to deceive each other.

Because they&#39;re sheep.

The Valkyrian group also seems to believe the rule over everyone, as if 2b2t belongs to them, it&#39;s pathetic and the longer it takes for a small group of their most valued members to realize this and sabotage the entire group, the worse it&#39;s going to get.

And this message is to Sato and some others it may concern.
I like you Sato, you&#39;re a decent guy, but the Valkyrian group is delusional, yes it has influence all across 2b2t, because of how large it once was/is, yes it&#39;s well-established, but no, it is not 2b2t&#39;s all powerful and mighty superpower, get that out of your head, the whole group can be taken down and destroyed by one person, I&#39;m not saying it will, but it can."

I disagree with the Valkaryians thinking they are in charge. There are players with power but the group as a whole is not. 

I also think people do dislike ore because he obviously says things that garnish a response. Something he&#39;s become very lax over since 2015 began. Oremonger&#39;s asking &#39;why are you always angry&#39; is to 2b2t what BuildSmash&#39;s &#39;why are you a hateful athiest&#39; was to new players.

Unity wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing if it was worth uniting with the people wanting it.

Unity accomplished a lot on 2b2t, look at the older Facepunch days. Also I&#39;m pretty sure thanks to having a 20something-strong group that Asgard 2 was built in mere days."

If people think we are in charge on 2b2t... that&#39;s not our concern.
We are going to spawn to hold it, base there, build there, make friends, kill things, destroy things, repeat the same cycle. Its what we do. We are just having fun.

Oh... and about not all players in the group don&#39;t have power...

You think I am crazy enough to send all my dear basemates to a dangerous spawn without proper equipment, tools and weapons? Pls... The entire Incursion is being sponsored by 1.4.7 dupe.
Thats the only reason why we are not at spawn yet.
This is just the beginning. All members from Asgard II will be armed to the teeth, that&#39;s a promise. 

[QUOTE=x0XP;47624042]I like you Sato, you&#39;re a decent guy, but the Valkyrian group is delusional, yes it has influence all across 2b2t, because of how large it once was/is, yes it&#39;s well-established, but no, it is not 2b2t&#39;s all powerful and mighty superpower, get that out of your head, the whole group can be taken down and destroyed by one person, I&#39;m not saying it will, but it can.[/QUOTE]

Bases, yes, they can be taken down by one person. The group? No. Asgard II is gone, but the group remains united.
This is exactly why we are going to spawn... its already a wasteland. And spawn bases are easy to repair. specially if its a spawn base made entirely of obsidian. Walls, floors, towers, roads, paths. Yeah, I think 2 dchest of endchests will do. And probably one more for future repairs.

Oh, and since we got the numbers, we would just tear down any lavacast and scamp so... 

And about TNT... well....

You see x0, we are not delusional. Actually, that&#39;s the only reason why the group survived for so long, because I am realistic about things. We plan everything. Each member relay on reputation. A unknown player will never join us. Our group is hold by a chain of trust. if someone breaks that chain, you will disappoint the people who recommended you, make lots of enemies, etc. Thats the vouch system. There is nothing to win by fucking up. The price is too high if you get caught. (Drew paid that price) Plus, everyone is free to leave to solo goals if they want at every time. I am not forcing anyone to go to spawn. I am just the guy who have ideas and organize them. Its been always like this. 

Now pls, enough with the drama facepunch. &lt;3"

No drama and I&#39;m not doubting the groups ability, but a lot of you have this pathetic idea in your heads that each and every person in the group is the shit. There&#39;s some people that can say that they are, there&#39;s a lot of them that can&#39;t.
The group can fall apart down to one single person, not in the sense of destroying a base. All it takes it a chain of events that they setup or use to their advantage to cause the group to fall a part. One person comes to mind that I believe still plays can do all of that too."

I didn&#39;t touch your Air temple.. was that destruction in the video... no..

Javazon did it..

I found the base because of a 2k+ nether rail.. I found Javazon looting the place and mass moving items out.. I killed him... Then I moved 90% of the remaining loot to a hiding spot... Then I blew up the things seen in the videos.

I never thought any part of that base was pyro&#39;s... All I thought was here is a lot of duped items.. let me grab them..

Don&#39;t give me any bullshit about wanting to go back and retire there.. the place had been abandoned for ages..

From what I&#39;ve heard, the only person who was using it was zack, from valk... now he was very mad when he found out...

Snacky himself told me he was glad I rekt the place..

So.. move on.. build a new base.. this is how 2b2t goes..."

I actually kinda was retired there though lol, I mean Coldwave was there logged out in the temple and I was at the time not playing very much because our group had sorta fallen apart. Also I swear someone said to me in passing that you were working with Javazon or he was your alt something.Also yeah Zach was using the place because I invited him there to sit with me and chizizzle while we waited for our group to get back together. But yeah that was like a long time ago, I have moved on but I still did do a lot of work repairing that place and building the Air Temple. Whatever duped items I had there were literally just so me and Zach could goof off while we waited to hear from Sato.

But yeah whatever its old timey history, and in the end just a game lol."

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=oremonger;47634992]I didn&#39;t touch your Air temple.. was that destruction in the video... no..

Javazon did it..

I found the base because of a 2k+ nether rail.. I found Javazon looting the place and mass moving items out.. I killed him... Then I moved 90% of the remaining loot to a hiding spot... Then I blew up the things seen in the videos.

I never thought any part of that base was pyro&#39;s... All I thought was here is a lot of duped items.. let me grab them..

Don&#39;t give me any bullshit about wanting to go back and retire there.. the place had been abandoned for ages..

From what I&#39;ve heard, the only person who was using it was zack, from valk... now he was very mad when he found out...

Snacky himself told me he was glad I rekt the place..

So.. move on.. build a new base.. this is how 2b2t goes...[/QUOTE]
 
I actually kinda was retired there though lol, I mean Coldwave was there logged out in the temple and I was at the time not playing very much because our group had sorta fallen apart. Also I swear someone said to me in passing that you were working with Javazon or he was your alt something.Also yeah Zach was using the place because I invited him there to sit with me and chizizzle while we waited for our group to get back together. But yeah that was like a long time ago, I have moved on but I still did do a lot of work repairing that place and building the Air Temple. Whatever duped items I had there were literally just so me and Zach could goof off while we waited to hear from Sato.

But yeah whatever its old timey history, and in the end just a game lol.</span>
