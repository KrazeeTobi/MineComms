Nah, Volunteers Base was started by bammers (a volunteer) its nothing more than a temp base. What really matters is the people, and they already moved elsewhere. We were expecting it to be griefed in a matter of days. After all, this is 2b2t. The Incursion goes on, no matter what happens to the any (present or future)Spawn base or who dies, Silly doge x0XP.

To be honest, these spawn bases act like baits. The fun part is to caught people there (stealing, griefing, etc) and kill them. That&#39;s what we did on the Second Incursion at Fubster Spawn base and NFE, and thats what we gonna keep doing. We already collected some poor souls on this one."

Nice shit edit. ^
Ore posted this picture taken by Sleepy (because he is too scared to go to spawn himself): [url]https://i.imgur.com/NeDv82X.png[/url]
Thinking it was our base, provoking us. He is too new to realize that&#39;s Cyto Spawn base and not our base. And since you cant delete posts on facepunch, he edited it.

Good luck next time, OreMongoloid.

Thinking it was our base, provoking us. He is too new to realize that&#39;s Cyto Spawn base and not our base. And since you cant delete posts on facepunch, he edited it.

I did, so what? I corrected my error.. and as for being scared of spawn.. I&#39;m on a KOS list for 60+ ppl (according to you), no one can beat that many vs one person.. so why would I go...

As someone said, you guys have those bases mostly as traps.... why would I willingly walk into a trap?

unless you guys gonna be like asgard II and rekt the base as soon as one of you sees me.."

Just log out, is my advice. Backup will get there eventually, and he can&#39;t do anything to the build. Only the house I built. but I have lined it with obsidian now as well.</span>

Relogged and continued working - half an hour later he&#39;s here again and attacked me. This time I had to logout immediately since not having any armor or apples left. He also seems to teleport somehow since he was able to jump all the way from the ground to the upper floor of the castle in a blink of an eye.

Enderpearls, most likely. I used that when I was in combat with him, and he was right on my tail (huehuehue tail kek xd) all the time, until I destroyed him quite properly. 

So far, the best bet is simply to log out, and hop on, on an alt. Remember, he cannot do any damage to SIB itself, merely my house, which is not a official part of SIB. Request backup here, or through Sato86, and let time have it&#39;s flow. 

I would also strongly recommend, not to log on unless Sato/Pyro/Myself/Silver etc are on, and on site."
