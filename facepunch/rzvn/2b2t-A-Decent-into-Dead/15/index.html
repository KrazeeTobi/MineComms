                            <span v-pre>You killed me once because I lagged. Congratulations. I admire you.

Would you like to talk about all the other times I killed you? The fall trap was my favorite.

EDIT: Another time I killed him, in case we get the usual &quot;you didn&#39;t kill me lmao&quot;.

Most of the people from it were almost gone from spawn, due the lack of activity. Which is understandable. SIB is complete. Spawn is ours. We had our fun.

Popbob, in his holy arrogance, arrived at spawn mocking us, asking why we were not there. He even bragged about killing me in 2013 (With omalymix help).

He was basically provoking us. They even killed _Henry_ near SIB, when he was leaving too. 3v1. 

1 hour later, Me, Fit(on Nes), Balony(on Cupcakest) and Jacktherippa(On bahsahkah) walked all the way down to spawn, arriving at SIB at the same time. popbob saw himself in a humiliating run to save his ass, using pearls to flee as soon as he logged back.  He even stumbled on me, having the change directions and then logging out. Tristan wasn&#39;t touch due his relation with me and Jack and he didnt react either. Jared, which is considered the most coward of the 3 (Popbob, Jared and Taylo) actually fought us, unlike pop. Then he escaped as well with pearls, but with a extremely damaged armor.

They got owned and put to run. We mined their lavacast and restored SIB again. 
The incursion will end officially at 28th may. 2 days left.

After those 2 days, you can do whatever you want, popbob.
Until there, you will be hunted down like a dog.
Omal is not here to help you this time. Tristan wont aid you.
And jared runs at the first sight of danger.
Taylo is your only reliable ally. But he is not online at all times.

I am calling out all available people to spawn for one last effort for these 2 days. I&#39;ll rearm everyone if I have to. 

2 days popbob.

[B]-----------THIRD SPAWN INCURSION REPORT-----------[/B]

It started at 28th April and it ended in 28th May. Here you can read my review of the Event.

[B]- Combat -[/B]

If there is lesson that 2b2t taught me through these years, the most important is this: 

[I]&quot;You can&#39;t do great things without attracting the envy and hate of others&quot;[/I]

But to counter that, 2b2t also taught me that [I]&quot;You must kill those fuckers until they either give up or run out of armor.&quot;[/I]

Now over. The Third Spawn Incursion faced much more opposition than the two first ones. But not a organized opposition. Just small attempts.
By working together, we managed to break their will. We noticed they stopped coming after the 2 first weeks, with a few exceptions. Most of the people in the KOS list died.
I won&#39;t deny that some of ours also died as well, but most came back. We kept supporting each other, specially the fallen. In many occasions we avenged them.

I don&#39;t have a accurate number, but this incursion probably hit around [B]300-500 player kills.[/B] (Taking out Pixelcheese bed trap deaths which would go pass 1k). 
Compared to the Second, this incursion was less violent with the newfriends. We kept our focus mostly on SIB, so we didn&#39;t have much time to actually go on a rampage. 

[B]- Bases -[/B]

It started earlier with the [B]Volunteer Base[/B] that bammerbeast started. I own him a big thanks. That base was important to reunite the crew and the volunteers together in the first days.
We got some amazing picture of that base. xcc2 and others made amazing stuff. 
But we were expecting it to be wiped out quickly, in a matter of days. The base is today in not that bad shape, but still a ghost town now.

The only reason why we took a couple days to get to spawn was also this:
[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/oEEc4SE.png[/IMG]
Thats is [B]Frontline[/B] aka FOB. That was our Forward Operating Base in military terms. Its the Incursion emergency supply depo as well as a place to repair armor. Its existence was kept secret for the whole event.

Many people don&#39;t know this, but we were actually planning more spawn bases. 7 bases. It was part of the Seven Hells Spawn Base. Each Base would receive the name of a Sin. We decided the first would be Wrath. In case that base was destroyed, we would proceed to make a new one. But that never was necessary. In the first incursion, we used 2k2k. In the Second, we had Fubster Spawn Base, which was where it started and then NFE. In the third, we had VB and SIB.

What I noticed is that spawn bases are only useful as baits and for crops, since running around it takes a lot of food. There is really no point on building there. Unless...

Thats where the obsidian comes in. I remember a old attempt to build a spawn base of obsidians, but not like sib is.
Offtopia built a obsidian floating castle at spawn. Very near the core, but it was worldedited by Hause when he removed all the cast. We also had a couple obsidian platforms floating in the skies.
Those are all gone. Hause deleted, but not on purpose though.

(Offtopia&#39;s Floating Obsidian Castle in 2013)

Wrath Outpost will resist for a couple years. It will be mined and withered, but I believe some of it will remain. 

[B]- Spawn -[/B]

We kept the roads of spawn and repaired some. We even placed a obsidian platform at 0, 64, 0. Sleepylittlefox then decorated it with the Valk eagles. Its was a pretty powerful symbol. 
We also repaired nether 0,0 and replaced part of the stone for obsidian. And then sleepy also made this:

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/VgKeCIA.png[/IMG]
Its a giant valkyrian eagle. The biggest ever made. Each big block is 4 blocks wide. The best part is that thats his second one. He made one of same size on the nether core.

We repaired some spawn bases and protected them as well. We made lots of new crops at spawn and we planted 4 stacks of spruce. Many which became giant spruces.
Newcomers shouldn&#39;t have reasons to complain for a while... but they always do.

[B]- The Plan -[/B]

Here is the initial plan for the Incursion I made so people at Asgard could have an idea of what would actually happen:
[url]http://www.mediafire.com/view/hrja819vv0cv8zm/THIRD_SPAWN_INCURSION_OPERATION.docx[/url]
You can either read it online or download.

If you read it, you&#39;ll notice some things happened according the plan and some did not.
To be honest, everything was better than I was expecting.
I could never dream with a base like SIB at the beginning of the event.

You can only remember/see what 2b2t is made of when you return to spawn.
Everything was a success. 
Congrats supporters/volunteers for the great performance. 

Goodbye Spawn, my old friend."

[B]-----------THIRD SPAWN INCURSION REPORT-----------[/B]

It started at 28th April and it ended in 28th May. Here you can read my review of the Event.

[B]- Combat -[/B]

If there is lesson that 2b2t taught me through these years, the most important is this: 

[I]&quot;You can&#39;t do great things without attracting the envy and hate of others&quot;[/I]

But to counter that, 2b2t also taught me that [I]&quot;You must kill those fuckers until they either give up or run out of armor.&quot;[/I]

Now over. The Third Spawn Incursion faced much more opposition than the two first ones. But not a organized opposition. Just small attempts.
By working together, we managed to break their will. We noticed they stopped coming after the 2 first weeks, with a few exceptions. Most of the people in the KOS list died.
I won&#39;t deny that some of ours also died as well, but most came back. We kept supporting each other, specially the fallen. In many occasions we avenged them.

I don&#39;t have a accurate number, but this incursion probably hit around [B]300-500 player kills.[/B] (Taking out Pixelcheese bed trap deaths which would go pass 1k). 
Compared to the Second, this incursion was less violent with the newfriends. We kept our focus mostly on SIB, so we didn&#39;t have much time to actually go on a rampage. 

[B]- Bases -[/B]

It started earlier with the [B]Volunteer Base[/B] that bammerbeast started. I own him a big thanks. That base was important to reunite the crew and the volunteers together in the first days.
We got some amazing picture of that base. xcc2 and others made amazing stuff. 
But we were expecting it to be wiped out quickly, in a matter of days. The base is today in not that bad shape, but still a ghost town now.

The only reason why we took a couple days to get to spawn was also this:

Thats is [B]Frontline[/B] aka FOB. That was our Forward Operating Base in military terms. Its the Incursion emergency supply depo as well as a place to repair armor. Its existence was kept secret for the whole event.

Many people don&#39;t know this, but we were actually planning more spawn bases. 7 bases. It was part of the Seven Hells Spawn Base. Each Base would receive the name of a Sin. We decided the first would be Wrath. In case that base was destroyed, we would proceed to make a new one. But that never was necessary. In the first incursion, we used 2k2k. In the Second, we had Fubster Spawn Base, which was where it started and then NFE. In the third, we had VB and SIB.

What I noticed is that spawn bases are only useful as baits and for crops, since running around it takes a lot of food. There is really no point on building there. Unless...

Thats where the obsidian comes in. I remember a old attempt to build a spawn base of obsidians, but not like sib is.
Offtopia built a obsidian floating castle at spawn. Very near the core, but it was worldedited by Hause when he removed all the cast. We also had a couple obsidian platforms floating in the skies.
Those are all gone. Hause deleted, but not on purpose though.

(Offtopia&#39;s Floating Obsidian Castle in 2013)

Wrath Outpost will resist for a couple years. It will be mined and withered, but I believe some of it will remain. 

[B]- Spawn -[/B]

We kept the roads of spawn and repaired some. We even placed a obsidian platform at 0, 64, 0. Sleepylittlefox then decorated it with the Valk eagles. Its was a pretty powerful symbol. 
We also repaired nether 0,0 and replaced part of the stone for obsidian. And then sleepy also made this:

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/VgKeCIA.png[/IMG]
Its a giant valkyrian eagle. The biggest ever made. Each big block is 4 blocks wide. The best part is that thats his second one. He made one of same size on the nether core.

We repaired some spawn bases and protected them as well. We made lots of new crops at spawn and we planted 4 stacks of spruce. Many which became giant spruces.
Newcomers shouldn&#39;t have reasons to complain for a while... but they always do.

[B]- The Plan -[/B]

Here is the initial plan for the Incursion I made so people at Asgard could have an idea of what would actually happen:
[url]http://www.mediafire.com/view/hrja819vv0cv8zm/THIRD_SPAWN_INCURSION_OPERATION.docx[/url]
You can either read it online or download.

If you read it, you&#39;ll notice some things happened according the plan and some did not.
To be honest, everything was better than I was expecting.
I could never dream with a base like SIB at the beginning of the event.

You can only remember/see what 2b2t is made of when you return to spawn.
Everything was a success. 
Congrats supporters/volunteers for the great performance. 

Goodbye Spawn, my old friend.</span>
