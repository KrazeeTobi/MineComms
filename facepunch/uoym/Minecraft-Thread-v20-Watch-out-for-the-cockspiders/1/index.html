[B]WHAT&#39;S NEW THIS SEECRET FRIDAY UPDATE oooOOOOOooo?[/B]
[IMG_thumb]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6741/sfu3byoctopie.png[/IMG_thumb]

[QUOTE]First of all, calling blocks &amp;#8220;Tiles&amp;#8221; in the codebase is horribly confusing. Also, TileEntities being named similar to Entities doesn&amp;#8217;t help at all.

But the worst piece of design is older than that, dating all the way back to the cave game test build. It&amp;#8217;s a walking null pointer exception waiting to happen.

I keep a static Tile[256] list that maps a byte value to a Tile instance, which is used to do all the block logic. For example, to find out what material a block is (say, id 40) I&amp;#8217;d go Tile.tiles[40].getMaterial(). Works fine.
But for some reason, I decided to make air have a null block, and be identified instead by its id, 0. This means that everywhere I want to do something with a Tile instance, I have to do something like &amp;#8220;int id = level.getTileAt(x, y, z); if (id==0) return false; else return Tile.tiles[id].getMaterial()==Material.rock;&amp;#8221; when checking for rock instead of just a simple &amp;#8220;return level.getTileAt(x, y, z).getMaterial()==Material.rock;&amp;#8221;

A couple of months ago, I made the effort to try to fix this, mainly by removing the ability to even ASK for a raw block type byte from the level, but it was really surprising how many places relied on those bytes. The renderer and level generators, primarely, act on the raw bytes a lot for speed. And additionally, there are a lot of places that rely on a Tile.tiles[getTileAt(x, y, z)]==null to check for air spaces.

The problem is just big and scary enough for my laziness to prevent me from fixing it, and it&amp;#8217;s not dangerous enough to force me to fix it (either the game works, or it doesn&amp;#8217;t. It can&amp;#8217;t corrupt saves or anything like that).

And the Seecret Friday Update is either coming within a few hours, or some time after many more, due to me attending a birthday party! (Happy birthday, if you&amp;#8217;re reading this. :D)[/QUOTE]

[B]About[/B]
MineCraft is a game developed by Markus Persson, also known as Notch. It was started on the May 10, 2009. It&#39;s a 3D block based game created in Java, meaning it is run in a browser. It&#39;s currently free, but for custom skins and the new games modes, you will have to pay 10 Euros, or whatever the equivalent in dollars is. The price will double when the game is closer to fruition.

[B]Single Player[/B]
You click single player on the front page and the level is generated, you have deep seas, sandy beaches and rolling hills. Huge cave  complex&#39;s  and beneath your feet, ready for exploration. It auto  generates forests  and other features. As you stroll through the many  valleys, you wonder, where are  the houses? You right click and to place  blocks, press B  and you change which block you are using! And you can  set all the blocks from  1-9, then use the keys to select each one. You  build yourself houses and fortresses using glass, wood and stone. Fun?  

However, if you have bought the game, you&#39;ll gain access to Indev and  Infdev. They both have the same goal: survival! You are stranded in the  middle of nowhere and you need to survive (obviously). Cut trees to get  wood, which is used for a variety of tools. In the day, sheep and pigs  will spawn, which can also be used for food and cloth! However, when  night falls, evil monsters appear which are ready to make your  experience of Minecraft a lot scarier! Build huge castles and  underground system to protect yourself from these monsters and dominate  the forsaken land of creepers, spiders, zombies and skeletons!Now, the difference between Indev and Infdev is that Infdev uses an infinite map  system. Indev maps have a fixed boundary while Infdev maps don&#39;t. You  can keep walking on forever in Infdev! By the way, the level generator  in Infdev is a lot more interesting than Indev&#39;s, so just 

play Infdev  for now!

[B]Multiplayer[/B]
This is where the fun with other players kicks in, you join up on the  server. Bang in front  of you are people all around, grand structures  being built. Some of it  is truly awe inspiring, you get lost in the  maze of buildings, murals  and towers. Want to build a Megastructure?  Now you can do it with  friends, meaning you can make it twice as epic in the same amount of  time it would of taken you alone.

[IMG]http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/2047/troubleshooting.png[/IMG]
Now you may get a variety of errors when trying to play this game,   before posting about them try these tips:
1) Use firefox, people seem to be having most luck with this.
2) Update your java
3) Turn off your firewall (multiplayer)
4) Refresh the page

[LIST]
[*]Gold is just as weak as wood, use diamond instead!
[*]Placing  sand directly above lava turns it into lava!
[*]The simplest way  to make your tower moster proof, is to have an under water entrance.
[*]Infdev  saves can be found in &quot;C:\Documents and  Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\.minecraft&quot;

[B]WHAT&#39;S NEW THIS SEECRET FRIDAY UPDATE oooOOOOOooo?[/B]
[IMG_thumb]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/6741/sfu3byoctopie.png[/IMG_thumb]

[QUOTE]First of all, calling blocks &amp;#8220;Tiles&amp;#8221; in the codebase is horribly confusing. Also, TileEntities being named similar to Entities doesn&amp;#8217;t help at all.

But the worst piece of design is older than that, dating all the way back to the cave game test build. It&amp;#8217;s a walking null pointer exception waiting to happen.

I keep a static Tile[256] list that maps a byte value to a Tile instance, which is used to do all the block logic. For example, to find out what material a block is (say, id 40) I&amp;#8217;d go Tile.tiles[40].getMaterial(). Works fine.
But for some reason, I decided to make air have a null block, and be identified instead by its id, 0. This means that everywhere I want to do something with a Tile instance, I have to do something like &amp;#8220;int id = level.getTileAt(x, y, z); if (id==0) return false; else return Tile.tiles[id].getMaterial()==Material.rock;&amp;#8221; when checking for rock instead of just a simple &amp;#8220;return level.getTileAt(x, y, z).getMaterial()==Material.rock;&amp;#8221;

A couple of months ago, I made the effort to try to fix this, mainly by removing the ability to even ASK for a raw block type byte from the level, but it was really surprising how many places relied on those bytes. The renderer and level generators, primarely, act on the raw bytes a lot for speed. And additionally, there are a lot of places that rely on a Tile.tiles[getTileAt(x, y, z)]==null to check for air spaces.

The problem is just big and scary enough for my laziness to prevent me from fixing it, and it&amp;#8217;s not dangerous enough to force me to fix it (either the game works, or it doesn&amp;#8217;t. It can&amp;#8217;t corrupt saves or anything like that).

And the Seecret Friday Update is either coming within a few hours, or some time after many more, due to me attending a birthday party! (Happy birthday, if you&amp;#8217;re reading this. :D)[/QUOTE]

[B]About[/B]
MineCraft is a game developed by Markus Persson, also known as Notch. It was started on the May 10, 2009. It&#39;s a 3D block based game created in Java, meaning it is run in a browser. It&#39;s currently free, but for custom skins and the new games modes, you will have to pay 10 Euros, or whatever the equivalent in dollars is. The price will double when the game is closer to fruition.

[B]Single Player[/B]
You click single player on the front page and the level is generated, you have deep seas, sandy beaches and rolling hills. Huge cave  complex&#39;s  and beneath your feet, ready for exploration. It auto  generates forests  and other features. As you stroll through the many  valleys, you wonder, where are  the houses? You right click and to place  blocks, press B  and you change which block you are using! And you can  set all the blocks from  1-9, then use the keys to select each one. You  build yourself houses and fortresses using glass, wood and stone. Fun?  

However, if you have bought the game, you&#39;ll gain access to Indev and  Infdev. They both have the same goal: survival! You are stranded in the  middle of nowhere and you need to survive (obviously). Cut trees to get  wood, which is used for a variety of tools. In the day, sheep and pigs  will spawn, which can also be used for food and cloth! However, when  night falls, evil monsters appear which are ready to make your  experience of Minecraft a lot scarier! Build huge castles and  underground system to protect yourself from these monsters and dominate  the forsaken land of creepers, spiders, zombies and skeletons!Now, the difference between Indev and Infdev is that Infdev uses an infinite map  system. Indev maps have a fixed boundary while Infdev maps don&#39;t. You  can keep walking on forever in Infdev! By the way, the level generator  in Infdev is a lot more interesting than Indev&#39;s, so just 

play Infdev  for now!

[B]Multiplayer[/B]
This is where the fun with other players kicks in, you join up on the  server. Bang in front  of you are people all around, grand structures  being built. Some of it  is truly awe inspiring, you get lost in the  maze of buildings, murals  and towers. Want to build a Megastructure?  Now you can do it with  friends, meaning you can make it twice as epic in the same amount of  time it would of taken you alone.

[IMG]http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/2047/troubleshooting.png[/IMG]
Now you may get a variety of errors when trying to play this game,   before posting about them try these tips:
1) Use firefox, people seem to be having most luck with this.
2) Update your java
3) Turn off your firewall (multiplayer)
4) Refresh the page

[LIST]
[*]Gold is just as weak as wood, use diamond instead!
[*]Placing  sand directly above lava turns it into lava!
[*]The simplest way  to make your tower moster proof, is to have an under water entrance.
[*]Infdev  saves can be found in &quot;C:\Documents and  Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data\.minecraft&quot;

It was getting dark. I had to leave my mine and head for home. I had made it perhaps within 100 yards of my home when I heard a faint whisper. I stopped for a second and looked around, nothing was there. My pace increased from a walk to a slow jog. Eventually I reached the house and exhaled deeply, my mind now at ease.

No sooner than I entered the bedroom had I heard that noise again, but it was louder now. Had I forgotten to barricade the door? My eyes widened, glancing around the room. There, in the dark corner, stood the intruder. He approached me and torchlight cast upon him. He stood slightly taller than me on his 4 legs. Studying him more closely, I was horrified at the sight of his huge, green, blocky penis, Both now stood erect, ready for action. That horrible, HORRIBLE sound now louder than ever as he charged me with his throbbing member.

He was too quick for me, and that was made immediately apparent as I was pinned to the ground with legs spread. He stood over me now, savoring the moment. He caressed me and leaned in, licking then whispering into my ear, &quot;SSSSSsSsSSS.&quot; I knew what was going to happen and prepared myself. That was of little use. He slammed into me over and over, his manhood tearing up my tight blocky ass. It seemed as if his dick was over 8 times the surface area of earth.

He doubled his speed with every thrust, his diamond pick tearing through my hole. He was spelunking my ass, and I could do nothing about it. I felt something expanding in me. His head. And it was about to run out of room and my ass was already having enough trouble accomodating his dick. I closed my eyes, which had already filled with tears, waiting for the inevitable. He hissed again, it was a deafining, ear-splitting sound.

&quot;sssssssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS S S S S!!&quot;

I let out a massive grunt. My asshole had exploded. Hot smoke filled the room. I lied there, for what I imagined was an eternity. I raised my head to look around. The intruder was nowhere to be found, but he had left my house in shambles. I gazed through a hole in the wall to find it was still dark out. My ears, though still ringing, heard something chilling; the whispers of countless others, who had been waiting for their chance."
