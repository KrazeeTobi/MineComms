 I have a friend who pretty much does that. There are only two subjects he talks about fighting games and anime. When he talks about anime I can&#39;t understand half of what he says because it&#39;s not in English. Irritates the hell out of me.

No, not really... Being gay is having a sexual interest in another member of the same sex. Sexual intercourse (of any kind) with a member of the same sex counts as well. But this is all way off-topic, even for this thread."

technically real weaboo = constantly using base words like kawaii, neko, -san, chibi, desu, etc, and shoving it all up in yo face whilst blabbing about naruto/inu yasha[/QUOTE]
 
This. Fucking this.

I like Japanese stuff. I like a lot of their games. I&#39;m a Zelda fan; I listen to Final Fantasy music in the car; I can sing the lyrics to One-Winged Angel from memory. I&#39;ve watched some animes, generally liked them, and only stopped watching NGE because I needed time to try to figure out what Gendo was up to (don&#39;t spoil, I haven&#39;t gotten back to it yet). I&#39;ve attempted to learn Japanese (didn&#39;t get very far). I blended quite a bit of Japanese flavor into the game I&#39;m designing.

Yet I am not a weeaboo. I have never used &quot;kawaii&quot; except in blatant parody; I have only used &quot;chibi&quot; to refer to the artistic style; I have not used the word &quot;desu&quot; except as &quot;it is&quot;, in a purely Japanese sentence. 

I do not believe Japanese art is superior to Western art. However, I do not believe the opposite. Each has its strengths and weaknesses; I attempt to combine the former and eliminate the latter in my own works. I attempt to not think of myself as &quot;a citizen of America&quot;, or a &quot;member of Western Civilization&quot;. I am an inhabitant of the Earth, a person whose interests and taste are not curtailed by national boundaries. If you look at my FP account, my location is listed merely as &quot;Sol 3&quot;, the astronomical name for this ball of rock and dirt we live on.

So, if any of you calls me a weeaboo, or a japanofag, or anything like that, you are not only wrong, you are being wrong in a way that is, itself, incorrect.

Sorry for going off on a tangent, guys."

technically real weaboo = constantly using base words like kawaii, neko, -san, chibi, desu, etc, and shoving it all up in yo face whilst blabbing about naruto/inu yasha[/QUOTE]
 
This. Fucking this.

I like Japanese stuff. I like a lot of their games. I&#39;m a Zelda fan; I listen to Final Fantasy music in the car; I can sing the lyrics to One-Winged Angel from memory. I&#39;ve watched some animes, generally liked them, and only stopped watching NGE because I needed time to try to figure out what Gendo was up to (don&#39;t spoil, I haven&#39;t gotten back to it yet). I&#39;ve attempted to learn Japanese (didn&#39;t get very far). I blended quite a bit of Japanese flavor into the game I&#39;m designing.

Yet I am not a weeaboo. I have never used &quot;kawaii&quot; except in blatant parody; I have only used &quot;chibi&quot; to refer to the artistic style; I have not used the word &quot;desu&quot; except as &quot;it is&quot;, in a purely Japanese sentence. 

I do not believe Japanese art is superior to Western art. However, I do not believe the opposite. Each has its strengths and weaknesses; I attempt to combine the former and eliminate the latter in my own works. I attempt to not think of myself as &quot;a citizen of America&quot;, or a &quot;member of Western Civilization&quot;. I am an inhabitant of the Earth, a person whose interests and taste are not curtailed by national boundaries. If you look at my FP account, my location is listed merely as &quot;Sol 3&quot;, the astronomical name for this ball of rock and dirt we live on.

So, if any of you calls me a weeaboo, or a japanofag, or anything like that, you are not only wrong, you are being wrong in a way that is, itself, incorrect.

Sorry for going off on a tangent, guys.</span>

                            <span v-pre>[QUOTE=gman003-main;25799796]This. Fucking this.

I like Japanese stuff. I like a lot of their games. I&#39;m a Zelda fan; I listen to Final Fantasy music in the car; I can sing the lyrics to One-Winged Angel from memory. I&#39;ve watched some animes, generally liked them, and only stopped watching NGE because I needed time to try to figure out what Gendo was up to (don&#39;t spoil, I haven&#39;t gotten back to it yet). I&#39;ve attempted to learn Japanese (didn&#39;t get very far). I blended quite a bit of Japanese flavor into the game I&#39;m designing.

Yet I am not a weeaboo. I have never used &quot;kawaii&quot; except in blatant parody; I have only used &quot;chibi&quot; to refer to the artistic style; I have not used the word &quot;desu&quot; except as &quot;it is&quot;, in a purely Japanese sentence. 

I do not believe Japanese art is superior to Western art. However, I do not believe the opposite. Each has its strengths and weaknesses; I attempt to combine the former and eliminate the latter in my own works. I attempt to not think of myself as &quot;a citizen of America&quot;, or a &quot;member of Western Civilization&quot;. I am an inhabitant of the Earth, a person whose interests and taste are not curtailed by national boundaries. If you look at my FP account, my location is listed merely as &quot;Sol 3&quot;, the astronomical name for this ball of rock and dirt we live on.

So, if any of you calls me a weeaboo, or a japanofag, or anything like that, you are not only wrong, you are being wrong in a way that is, itself, incorrect.

Sorry for going off on a tangent, guys.[/QUOTE]

I guess I&#39;m not a weeboo after all. I never say &quot;&amp;#12363;&amp;#12431;&amp;#12356;&amp;#12356;&amp;#65281;&amp;#65281;&amp;#8221; (Kawaii) in public or at all, outside of Japanese class, but I do never fail to show off my new shiny Japanese keyboard feature.</span>

I may.

I think what most people really hate isn&#39;t the anime, it&#39;s the rabid fans. Like Twilight. I&#39;m actually not convinced the book itself is bad, it&#39;s just the fans that are so stupid and hate-worthy. Not having read it, I can&#39;t judge the book itself, but the fans are just infuriating. Same stuff happens with Japanese stuff.

I think what most people really hate isn&#39;t the anime, it&#39;s the rabid fans. Like Twilight. I&#39;m actually not convinced the book itself is bad, it&#39;s just the fans that are so stupid and hate-worthy. Not having read it, I can&#39;t judge the book itself, but the fans are just infuriating. Same stuff happens with Japanese stuff.
