Hey, mining for material is where it&#39;s at, but when making those crazy things you are... you kinda have to cheat.

[QUOTE=Saza;26683648]Hey guys. A few days ago, I started work on what would be my best accomplishment in my pathetic Minecraft history.


I started a railroad.



So I&#39;ve been working on it for days. I&#39;ll admit now I was a dirty cheater for the 1000+ rail tracks, minecarts, and cobblestone I used, but in the end it was a good product.

If anyone wants the .dat, it&#39;s on Peaceful because creepers would fuck my shit and KEEP IT THAT WAY, do tell me where to find it as I&#39;ve forgotten if you want it.

I stared a new map originally to see Portals. I started a base, but lost it with Portals so I turned to Peaceful and building a shit ton.

If you&#39;re wondering how I made tools unbreakable, I set their damage to negative numbers, Negative HP chainmail as well.[/QUOTE]
 
Make a video. I want to see how it looks like. Here is my minor &quot;railroad&quot;, build by 100% not cheating. Even had to make twice the amount of minecarts you see there because they glitch out of existence now and then. Fucking physics.

Triple quote post time!

[QUOTE=Atokniro;26685493]So if Doomish is at school, why shouldn&#39;t I just make the thread? Hours of waiting for him to get home, instead of hours spent discussing the game.[/QUOTE]
Because Doomish has been dying to do this since V38. Why is it so big a deal for you to make this one? If you let Doomish make the next one, I am sure everyone supports your claim to V51. That way we sidestep a lot of unneeded drama."

Hey, mining for material is where it&#39;s at, but when making those crazy things you are... you kinda have to cheat.

[QUOTE=Saza;26683648]Hey guys. A few days ago, I started work on what would be my best accomplishment in my pathetic Minecraft history.


I started a railroad.



So I&#39;ve been working on it for days. I&#39;ll admit now I was a dirty cheater for the 1000+ rail tracks, minecarts, and cobblestone I used, but in the end it was a good product.

If anyone wants the .dat, it&#39;s on Peaceful because creepers would fuck my shit and KEEP IT THAT WAY, do tell me where to find it as I&#39;ve forgotten if you want it.

I stared a new map originally to see Portals. I started a base, but lost it with Portals so I turned to Peaceful and building a shit ton.

If you&#39;re wondering how I made tools unbreakable, I set their damage to negative numbers, Negative HP chainmail as well.[/QUOTE]
 
Make a video. I want to see how it looks like. Here is my minor &quot;railroad&quot;, build by 100% not cheating. Even had to make twice the amount of minecarts you see there because they glitch out of existence now and then. Fucking physics.
