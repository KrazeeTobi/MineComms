To be honest, I see the current survival mode as a playgroung to test new things and fix engine bugs. It&#39;s ultimately raw in my (and maybe Notch&#39;s) eyes. Real survival will have a lot more interaction and feedback from the world than just animal mobs and placing/destroying blocks. Maybe some other player mobs, maybe caravans done by enemy mobs which you can rob, maybe some small lone houses or big villiges with population or abandomed ones."

The canal around my castle works as a trap, everything that falls in it floats to a central room with a drowning trap (3rd picture). To farm all the obsidian I made a obsidian factory, put my guy below it, dropped something heavy on my mouse left key and went afk for 1 hour. I also spend several hours finding sheep for the white tiles, but it was worth it in the end i guess.

                            <span v-pre>I&#39;ve been working on a little castle in single player the last few days. It&#39;s not finished yet but the castle itself is. The canal around my castle works as a trap, everything that falls in it floats to a central room with a drowning trap (3rd picture). To farm all the obsidian I made a obsidian factory, put my guy below it, dropped something heavy on my mouse left key and went afk for 1 hour. I also spend several hours finding sheep for the white tiles, but it was worth it in the end i guess.

Yeah, it&#39;s cartographer. Notch made a previewer at [url]www.minecraft.net/preview.jsp[/url] or something like that, but it hasn&#39;t worked since Stairs were implemented since he never put in an overview graphic of them, so he just took it off the site."

SIGH. You start your ascent. It&#39;s gonna be a looooooong night.

[img]http://i56.tinypic.com/2f06quu.png[/img]

You are now Zoey. You&#39;re lucky you have your tracksuit or it&#39;d be mildly cold out. The wussy men have left you 4 dead (some sort of pun, you assume), presuming you WERE dead. You got knocked out in the helicopter crash and have recently woken up. The boys all went off in their separate directions. You caught sight of Louis way off in the distance and decided to follow him, but now you&#39;ve basically given up and decided to set up camp for the night.

[img_thumb]http://i52.tinypic.com/xqkgud.png[/img_thumb]

In your inventory is a bunch of clay, a large amount of sticks, some cobblestone, some cigarettes, and a diamond shovel. Lucky you!

You keep all your stuff in your tracksuit pockets. You seem to have picked up a pack of Bill&#39;s cigarettes somewhere, though you don&#39;t even smoke. Unlike the boys, you&#39;ve thought ahead, and have gathered a huge bundle of sticks. Unfortunately you don&#39;t have any way to light them, but you may find something along the way as a natural survivalist.

Like you thought earlier, you&#39;ve basically given up on looking for Louis. It&#39;s best at this point to just think of a way to survive since it gets pretty cold at night. They always say it&#39;s always warmer underground, and you DO have a diamond shovel...

(If all this character stuff is disorientating you, don&#39;t worry, we only have Louis left to go and then we can go on with the plot!)
