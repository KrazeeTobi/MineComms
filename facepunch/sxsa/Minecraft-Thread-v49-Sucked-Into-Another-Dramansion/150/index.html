I put effort into making it. I even attempted humour in the mob descriptions :saddowns:

I&#39;ll drop it if I can atleast do 51, so the fresh person supporters are happy, and what I wrote doesn&#39;t go to waste. 

Inacio put a lot of effort into a banner, and it would be a shame to see it wasted.

I really do doubt that, but read above. And why should I get out? Because I don&#39;t want to wait a possible ten hours to post (if it closes while he is asleep, before school he probably won&#39;t have time, and he probably can&#39;t do it at school, so 10 is generous)

Doomish has had it called for quite a long time you know. If you really want to prove that he hasn&#39;t, go and look through about 9 threads.
And if you don&#39;t get 51, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t give the OP of that yours, and he/she could take information and mix them both up. It&#39;s only a thread.
What&#39;s stopping Doomish putting Inacio&#39;s banner up anyway?"

Doomish has had it called for quite a long time you know. If you really want to prove that he hasn&#39;t, go and look through about 9 threads.
And if you don&#39;t get 51, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t give the OP of that yours, and he/she could take information and mix them both up. It&#39;s only a thread.

Yes I will.
I&#39;m not denying he called it, but I can&#39;t see the point of waiting
If he gets to call a thread and have the entire community wait, why not others too.
I don&#39;t think Doomish likes Inacio anyway

Ninja edit, I never said he didn&#39;t. What I did ask is why wait.
If everyone wants to wait for him if he calls it, then fine. But the same should therefore be given to others, or its elitist bullshit.

Here are the posts even.
[QUOTE=Atokniro;26687243]I put effort into making it. I even attempted humour in the mob descriptions :saddowns:

I&#39;ll drop it if I can atleast do 51, so the fresh person supporters are happy, and what I wrote doesn&#39;t go to waste. 

Inacio put a lot of effort into a banner, and it would be a shame to see it wasted.

[QUOTE=Jacko245;26687336]I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;ll &#39;drop&#39; it?
Doomish has had it called for quite a long time you know. If you really want to prove that he hasn&#39;t, go and look through about 9 threads.
And if you don&#39;t get 51, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t give the OP of that yours, and he/she could take information and mix them both up. It&#39;s only a thread.
What&#39;s stopping Doomish putting Inacio&#39;s banner up anyway?[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE=Atokniro;26687243]I put effort into making it. I even attempted humour in the mob descriptions :saddowns:

I&#39;ll drop it if I can atleast do 51, so the fresh person supporters are happy, and what I wrote doesn&#39;t go to waste. 

Inacio put a lot of effort into a banner, and it would be a shame to see it wasted.

[QUOTE=Jacko245;26687336]I&#39;m sorry, you&#39;ll &#39;drop&#39; it?
Doomish has had it called for quite a long time you know. If you really want to prove that he hasn&#39;t, go and look through about 9 threads.
And if you don&#39;t get 51, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t give the OP of that yours, and he/she could take information and mix them both up. It&#39;s only a thread.
What&#39;s stopping Doomish putting Inacio&#39;s banner up anyway?[/QUOTE]

I&#39;ll leave it now, i think it was the way you worded it that made me believe other things.

It&#39;s just a walkway inside atm(soon to be minetrack), but we have houses and a farm inside both mountains. The one on the right runs through the entire thing to a few of those massive trees clumped together. Will eventually become some kind of tree village...
On the left we have a mine going down, (haven&#39;t found more than 10 iron yet, but about 3 or 4 stacks of coal) and that weird waterfall thing kills creepers, because they&#39;re dumb.

Also, as i mentioned before, there is now another bridge attached to that, on the top level of the mountain. We have a tower there."

I&#39;ll leave it now, i think it was the way you worded it that made me believe other things.

It&#39;s just a walkway inside atm(soon to be minetrack), but we have houses and a farm inside both mountains. The one on the right runs through the entire thing to a few of those massive trees clumped together. Will eventually become some kind of tree village...
On the left we have a mine going down, (haven&#39;t found more than 10 iron yet, but about 3 or 4 stacks of coal) and that weird waterfall thing kills creepers, because they&#39;re dumb.

Also, as i mentioned before, there is now another bridge attached to that, on the top level of the mountain. We have a tower there.</span>

Never heard of that rule, it&#39;s just i cant be arsed to argue any more.

The server&#39;s private since it can only sustain about 3-4 people (and it&#39;s only hosted on his computer)...
It gets majorly laggy at night, but at daytime, it&#39;s great!

He is saying that everything is free for alpha players because he guaranteed it and can&#39;t legally charge anything to us. His lawyers told him to remove that line, so he did, so any players who buy it during Beta might have to pay for DLC, but its no guarantee that he will make paid DLC at all, and if he does, I think it will be for him to sustain development."

Good. Because I want some mods, but I&#39;m too lazy to add them. Hah.

Anyways, the only flaw I really see with the price rise/etc is that people who haven&#39;t bought the Alpha would feel undermined compared to the ones who obtained Minecraft before Alpha. I mean, we will get the free updates, and the beta users won&#39;t. I&#39;m not exactly sure how the whole situation will work out."

                            <span v-pre>So, Beta will come on the 20th, huh? And it will start with mod support?
Good. Because I want some mods, but I&#39;m too lazy to add them. Hah.

Anyways, the only flaw I really see with the price rise/etc is that people who haven&#39;t bought the Alpha would feel undermined compared to the ones who obtained Minecraft before Alpha. I mean, we will get the free updates, and the beta users won&#39;t. I&#39;m not exactly sure how the whole situation will work out.</span>
