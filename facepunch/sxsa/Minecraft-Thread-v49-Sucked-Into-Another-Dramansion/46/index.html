I exit out of the game by saving, but Minecraft didn&#39;t display the &quot;Saving Blocks&quot; loading screen thing like it usually did.  I go to change to a different texture pack to test it out, and enter the game again.  I am greeted to a mob of zombies, and run for my life after a scream of terror.  I climbed up my stairs, frantically trying to keep my balance, and open the door leading into my mountain house.  I spawned in the unlit area under my house, which is a hugely detrimental flaw as monsters can exist there without bother of the sun.  Still, I almost got fucked.  Oddly enough, I still haven&#39;t died on this save.

I have had some near death experiences though.


1.  A very close encounter with a creeper who jumped off a mountain and exploded right in my fucking face.

2.  An even closer encounter with a creeper where I turned to walk back to my house and another creature was awaiting me at my unfinished house.

3.  Mining coal casually, lava suddenly sprouts out from above me where I had mined.  Luckily, there was water nearby or I would have died by immolation.  This retaught me the lesson of never digging straight up.

4.  I was going to fight off the living creatures taking sanctuary under my towering mountain house.  Awaiting me was a large mob of skeletons, and I ran away as they shot at my ass.  The sun&#39;s rays destroyed the last one on my last heart.

5.  I was sneaking over my staircase, haughtily taunting two zombies for being a lower life form than I and heavily insulting their intelligence.  I accidentally release the shift button and fall to my doom.  They managed to get a bite out of me before I got to my stairs, bastards.

  Anyone else have any interesting near death experiences?"

With the data gathered from this experiment, I deduce that everything in the minecraft world, all matter, is made from tiny entities.

When these particles move at high speeds, they eventually reach the speed of &quot;render&quot;. &quot;Render&quot; is the speed on which things appear to you. Just go to a high mountain looking down, and look across the land. If you were not there, you will see a slight &quot;render lag&quot;, where bits of landscape appear to appear.
Now when minecarts reach the render max, they move strangely. They start shifting in the y and x axis, moving side to side, not up. This causes them to move to other tracks. We don&#39;t know why these CPs move this way, and hopefully will find out how.
Now when minecarts are in close proximity to each other, they start to chain together inside each other. A theory is that each the Chez Particles that make up minecarts are attracted to other minecart CPs, and they link together. Why do they go into each other? We don&#39;t know, but a popular theory is that there is a lot of empty space inside each CP, and there is plenty of space to compact."
