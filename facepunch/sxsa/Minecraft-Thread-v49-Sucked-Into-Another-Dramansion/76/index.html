 Sorry for not releasing new parts of my comics in the last time, but I had to slow down a bit in my life. You see, looks like I&#39;ve got depression relapse again, it&#39;s hard for me to come up with something creative and funny in that time, not even mentioning school. Currently I&#39;m taking 100 mg of Asertin, 60 mg of Lerivon and 18 mg of Concerta for my ADHD (the real one, not the &quot;hyperactive kid running around the house that needs a slap with trouser belt&quot;).
So, yeah. I will be back though.[/QUOTE]

It has 23 spawn rooms layed out in a tower system and uses cactus + drowners to do the job. I&#39;m really pleased with it. 
Based on these 3 towers it currently gets 774 items per hour based on a 10 minute testing period. If I were to add more towers I expect this would increase until it reached the mob limit.
This video shows it off including the layout of all of the parts.

Probably late, but it looks like your collection point is too close to the towers, IIRC mobs can&#39;t spawn within 24 blocks of the player."

It&amp;#8217;s absolutely amazing. I love how it keeps it very vanilla, with griefing allowed, but only when it benefits you. No burning down random houses, but you can destroy a wall to get into an enemy fortress, burn a wooden house when an enemy is inside, or steal everything in some crazy neighbor&amp;#8217;s house.
The only mods is the area chat, where you can only talk to people within your area of about a hundred block radius, the mail and general banning mods, the fact that leaves and logs cannot be burned, and messages that say when someone dies and what or who killed them.
This is the reason I&amp;#8217;m not posting as often. It&amp;#8217;s just so fun, and really what SMP should be."

It&amp;#8217;s absolutely amazing. I love how it keeps it very vanilla, with griefing allowed, but only when it benefits you. No burning down random houses, but you can destroy a wall to get into an enemy fortress, burn a wooden house when an enemy is inside, or steal everything in some crazy neighbor&amp;#8217;s house. 
The only mods is the area chat, where you can only talk to people within your area of about a hundred block radius, the mail and general banning mods, the fact that leaves and logs cannot be burned, and messages that say when someone dies and what or who killed them.
This is the reason I&amp;#8217;m not posting as often. It&amp;#8217;s just so fun, and really what SMP should be.[/QUOTE]So basically you can do whatever so long as it benefits you or another person? Sounds feasible, but how well is random griefing enforced?</span>

                        <postrender input="Guys I&#39;m scared to shit.

Today I started a singleplayer world (for all these days I was doing MP)


So I built a cave and built a house.

I discovered another cave attached to my manmade cave.

I lit it up and thought nothing about it.

Later I heard zombies moaning. I went downstairs and saw 5 FUCKING zombies ambushing me,
I had a staircase so I killed them on it.

I lit up the area they were in and I was terrified to find evidence of another human being being in my save file. It may have been herobrine.

I saw 2 half chests filled with food and string. I got it, then I saw this blue box that looked like a kennel cage.

I beat it down trying to eliminate it when a zombie spawned.

I&#39;m worried that herobrine exists.

Due to the fact the room I was in had food automatically placed in it.

AND random chests.

The room was made of cobblestone as well.

                            <span v-pre>Guys I&#39;m scared to shit.

Today I started a singleplayer world (for all these days I was doing MP)


So I built a cave and built a house.

I discovered another cave attached to my manmade cave.

I lit it up and thought nothing about it.

Later I heard zombies moaning. I went downstairs and saw 5 FUCKING zombies ambushing me,
I had a staircase so I killed them on it.

I lit up the area they were in and I was terrified to find evidence of another human being being in my save file. It may have been herobrine.

I saw 2 half chests filled with food and string. I got it, then I saw this blue box that looked like a kennel cage.

I beat it down trying to eliminate it when a zombie spawned.

I&#39;m worried that herobrine exists.

Due to the fact the room I was in had food automatically placed in it.

AND random chests.

The room was made of cobblestone as well.
