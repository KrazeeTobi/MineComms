What the hell are you talking about

You aren&#39;t paying twice, buying during alpha was like pre-ordering, but you got it while it was still in early development. Now that the beta is here you pay full price to have it immediately PLUS owning it forever, including the full release version.

What the hell are you talking about

You aren&#39;t paying twice, buying during alpha was like pre-ordering, but you got it while it was still in early development. Now that the beta is here you pay full price to have it immediately PLUS owning it forever, including the full release version.

[quote=tabarnaco;26646951]i meant it would be silly to make people pay for both the beta and the full version. I didn&#39;t say he was going to do that. :v:[/quote]

-Hey look I&#39;m working on this thing with all my heart every day as in a full time job, I want to ask a little money for it
-Ok, fine, you deserve it :smile:
-And when long after the release I will fix all the bugs and sales will die slowly, I will work hard again and make some more awesome fun stuff, ofcourse I will ask to pay for it because I need to get something for my hard work.
-OH YOU FUCKING GREEDY BASTARD HOW COULD YOU ASK MONEY FOR SOMETHIG YOU ARE SPENDING YOU ARE DOING FOR A LIVING!!!

The only reason he is not charging Alpha users for updates is because he doesn&#39;t know anything about economics and he never thought that this will be such a big thing so he made a promise it will be free. Then he hired smart people who knows how business works and he understood that he need to charge for something in the future, but he didn&#39;t let US do it because he&#39;s a HONEST man and keept the promise.[/QUOTE]
 You say it like Notch is some poor bastard working in a basement barely making enough money to get food for the day.

-Hey look I&#39;m working on this thing with all my heart every day as in a full time job, I want to ask a little money for it
-Ok, fine, you deserve it :smile:
-And when long after the release I will fix all the bugs and sales will die slowly, I will work hard again and make some more awesome fun stuff, ofcourse I will ask to pay for it because I need to get something for my hard work.
-OH YOU FUCKING GREEDY BASTARD HOW COULD YOU ASK MONEY FOR SOMETHIG YOU ARE SPENDING YOU ARE DOING FOR A LIVING!!!

The only reason he is not charging Alpha users for updates is because he doesn&#39;t know anything about economics and he never thought that this will be such a big thing so he made a promise it will be free. Then he hired smart people who knows how business works and he understood that he need to charge for something in the future, but he didn&#39;t let US do it because he&#39;s a HONEST man and keept the promise.[/QUOTE]
 You say it like Notch is some poor bastard working in a basement barely making enough money to get food for the day.
