I only recall insulting your dad when we were friends, and he was being a shit to you. I don&#39;t know what text bombed means. Which friend? I don&#39;t forge anything about you, anything I could possibly say about you is true because you&#39;re a fucking asshole. I don&#39;t brag about anything, and I&#39;m not spoiled, we hardly have any money. I don&#39;t recall ever calling you a redneck, but I can recall you calling me one constantly. I don&#39;t get 3 games a week, you do. When I have you on my friends list I go to community and check the events, and it&#39;s constantly &quot;Lilcheeselad bought X&quot;. I&#39;m not rich, once again. I don&#39;t ever try to be friends with you then troll you, that&#39; what you do to me. Sometimes I&#39;ll add you to try to be friends, yes, but then it ends with you being a trolling faggot spouting memes like a 12 year old who just got off /b/. I don&#39;t have an Xbox, and I&#39;ve never played a game on Xbox with you. Why would I spend my money on games that I don&#39;t play to piss you off? I used to hit on you? Sorry, I&#39;m straight. Get over yourself. You&#39;re a stupid fucking prick that nobody should like, because 99% of everything you just said to make a slight argument was a lie to turn the people in this thread against me. The only reason people like you is because you act like a cool person on FP, when in reality you&#39;re a cocksucking asshole who does absolutely nothing to make himself a better person. I&#39;m done arguing with you, go fuck yourself.[/QUOTE]
 
Yeah, you started the argument. I don&#39;t feel like digging pictures and chat logs up, but there&#39;s no use denying. Just get out, Flamecow. :frog:

Yeah, you started the argument. I don&#39;t feel like digging pictures and chat logs up, but there&#39;s no use denying. Just get out, Flamecow. :frog:
