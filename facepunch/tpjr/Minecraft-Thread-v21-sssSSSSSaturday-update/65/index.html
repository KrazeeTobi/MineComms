&quot;I&#39;ve been in my mines for days. I finally found diamond and some of that mysterious red stuff. Excited, I rushed up to my home, which took about 4 days of climbing to do. I crafted a diamond pickaxe, ready to get rich selling my warez, but then I noticed something. I walked outside. The city was no longer bustling. I turned around. The walls behind my house were destroyed. Neighboring homes destroyed. I walked through the city until I could see the town center.

It was terrible. I looked up at the top and an explosion took out the wall. People rushed out of the citadel with precious city belongings, heading off in all sorts of directions. The streets were destroyed. I walked out of the city and a message popped up in the chat saying &quot;join the blue faction, we have iron!&quot;. Another, &quot;join the red faction, we&#39;ve got enough diamond to go around!&quot;

The city had split up in to pieces. Two factions. Many wanderers. As I walked over a hill to my secondary home, where I kept my best findings, I turned around. The city was in ruin. Holes everywhere. Signs saying EVACUATE and We&#39;re DOOMED were everywhere.

Facepunch City has been torn by war.&quot;"

                            <span v-pre>What I imagine it to be like:


&quot;I&#39;ve been in my mines for days. I finally found diamond and some of that mysterious red stuff. Excited, I rushed up to my home, which took about 4 days of climbing to do. I crafted a diamond pickaxe, ready to get rich selling my warez, but then I noticed something. I walked outside. The city was no longer bustling. I turned around. The walls behind my house were destroyed. Neighboring homes destroyed. I walked through the city until I could see the town center.

It was terrible. I looked up at the top and an explosion took out the wall. People rushed out of the citadel with precious city belongings, heading off in all sorts of directions. The streets were destroyed. I walked out of the city and a message popped up in the chat saying &quot;join the blue faction, we have iron!&quot;. Another, &quot;join the red faction, we&#39;ve got enough diamond to go around!&quot;

The city had split up in to pieces. Two factions. Many wanderers. As I walked over a hill to my secondary home, where I kept my best findings, I turned around. The city was in ruin. Holes everywhere. Signs saying EVACUATE and We&#39;re DOOMED were everywhere.

&quot;I&#39;ve been in my mines for days. I finally found diamond and some of that mysterious red stuff. Excited, I rushed up to my home, which took about 4 days of climbing to do. I crafted a diamond pickaxe, ready to get rich selling my warez, but then I noticed something. I walked outside. The city was no longer bustling. I turned around. The walls behind my house were destroyed. Neighboring homes destroyed. I walked through the city until I could see the town center.

It was terrible. I looked up at the top and an explosion took out the wall. People rushed out of the citadel with precious city belongings, heading off in all sorts of directions. The streets were destroyed. I walked out of the city and a message popped up in the chat saying &quot;join the blue faction, we have iron!&quot;. Another, &quot;join the red faction, we&#39;ve got enough diamond to go around!&quot;

The city had split up in to pieces. Two factions. Many wanderers. As I walked over a hill to my secondary home, where I kept my best findings, I turned around. The city was in ruin. Holes everywhere. Signs saying EVACUATE and We&#39;re DOOMED were everywhere.
