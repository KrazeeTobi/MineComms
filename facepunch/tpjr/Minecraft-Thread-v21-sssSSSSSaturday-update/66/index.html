One thing I&#39;m hoping for, is that shop owners will create clever security devices and general machinery to go in their stores. I remember when I first played a garrysmod rp I was amazed at the intricate wire systems shop keepers had made, alot of them including buttons. So I planned my own shop. 

[img]http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2904/supx.jpg[/img]

I would get in through some kind of secret entrance and end up behind the counter. The counter would be big enough able to pass things through, but small to not let people jump in. Then the customer would come in through door 0. They would wait until any other customers are done, then I would press a button that would open door 1. They would then walk into the gap between door 1 and door 2. I would make sure no other customers are in there with him, and then close door 1. I would then open door 2. The customer would come in. I would then ask him what he wanted. Once he tells me, I would go into storage to get their order. I would go back in, and give it to him. I would wait until he pays me. If he doesnt pay me, I would remove a block or torch that would either burn him in lava or suffocate him in sand. If he did pay, I would take the money, and let him out both the doors in succesion. The next customer would come in, and so on.

I know its un-needingly complicated, but its just an idea. I might actually do it, depending on how SMP turns out."

                            <span v-pre>I think we should plan out the actual buildings now, but leave the actual city layout for improvisation once we find a good spot. 


One thing I&#39;m hoping for, is that shop owners will create clever security devices and general machinery to go in their stores. I remember when I first played a garrysmod rp I was amazed at the intricate wire systems shop keepers had made, alot of them including buttons. So I planned my own shop. 

[img]http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/2904/supx.jpg[/img]

I would get in through some kind of secret entrance and end up behind the counter. The counter would be big enough able to pass things through, but small to not let people jump in. Then the customer would come in through door 0. They would wait until any other customers are done, then I would press a button that would open door 1. They would then walk into the gap between door 1 and door 2. I would make sure no other customers are in there with him, and then close door 1. I would then open door 2. The customer would come in. I would then ask him what he wanted. Once he tells me, I would go into storage to get their order. I would go back in, and give it to him. I would wait until he pays me. If he doesnt pay me, I would remove a block or torch that would either burn him in lava or suffocate him in sand. If he did pay, I would take the money, and let him out both the doors in succesion. The next customer would come in, and so on.

I know its un-needingly complicated, but its just an idea. I might actually do it, depending on how SMP turns out.</span>

&quot;I&#39;ve been in my mines for days. I finally found diamond and some of that mysterious red stuff. Excited, I rushed up to my home, which took about 4 days of climbing to do. I crafted a diamond pickaxe, ready to get rich selling my warez, but then I noticed something. I walked outside. The city was no longer bustling. I turned around. The walls behind my house were destroyed. Neighboring homes destroyed. I walked through the city until I could see the town center.

It was terrible. I looked up at the top and an explosion took out the wall. People rushed out of the citadel with precious city belongings, heading off in all sorts of directions. The streets were destroyed. I walked out of the city and a message popped up in the chat saying &quot;join the blue faction, we have iron!&quot;. Another, &quot;join the red faction, we&#39;ve got enough diamond to go around!&quot;

The city had split up in to pieces. Two factions. Many wanderers. As I walked over a hill to my secondary home, where I kept my best findings, I turned around. The city was in ruin. Holes everywhere. Signs saying EVACUATE and We&#39;re DOOMED were everywhere.

Facepunch City has been torn by war.&quot;

&quot;I kept walking over the hills. I saw a large, blue flag with some kind of white cloth symbol on it. I walked a little closer and saw many other people roaming around, setting up complicated contraptions. I asked around. Someone told me that it was the blue faction&#39;s fortress. I stepped inside. I looked through a glass window to see an underground chamber with someone in a red-armor skin with 3 blue faction members pointing swords at him.

I saw controlled detonations underground. Miners, collecting supplies. Thieves sprinting down corridors with their loot, depositing it all around. And only then did the local chat run amok with screams of:

&quot;OMG WANDERER&quot;
&quot;wtf wanderer in baes!11&quot;
&quot;dere be wanderr get leder!&quot;

It was a shame such an organized place was run by such low-level idiots. Suppose I&#39;d better check out the red faction.&quot;"
