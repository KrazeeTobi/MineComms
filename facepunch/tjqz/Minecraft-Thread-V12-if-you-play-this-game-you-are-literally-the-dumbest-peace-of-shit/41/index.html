Alright I planted another torch on the sand of the island, and the sand disappeared again, looks like if you plant a torch on top of a single layer of sand on top of water, the sand disappears.

                            <span v-pre>Still looking forward to Infdev Multiplayer. I honestly think that will be a game that I get completely addicted too. I can just imagine playing all night and all day with friends, building forts, killing creepers, mining, exploring, etc. 
 
I would even pay a subscribtion to it if I had to.</span>

A kingdom - roleplaying server or something relevant. 

People join server. They start out as they usually do. In the middle of fucking nowhere. They have to start building their shelter. It so goes on and on until people have their basic blocky home. Then they start gathering like usually. Mining, farming, planting trees or whatever.
Soon there is a player who is enough powerful to build himself a castle or something bigger and wealthier than just a wooden house. He becomes a king. He then can recruit other players as knights or such. However like kings do, he must pay them.
Knights then have to make themselves basic armor and weaponry and obey kings orders. Now but how king gets more wealth when he is sitting on the throne. 
TAXES
Lets say 1 iron bar / or block a day from player. King hires tax collectors. These guys can take up to 3 knights with them to collect taxes from all players who are living around. (Only living. They must have a house or such.) If one cant pay his tax first day he has chance to pay it second day + the second tax. However if nothing comes on third day. Knights have right to put the house on fire / loot chests in house or just turn it into a guard house or warehouse or something similar.
Now king has his basic income he can hire miners, woodcutters, farmers etc. 

Note : I hope there will be currency and trading possibility in Infdev MP as it will get hard paying in iron only.

Knights must guard too. Would be good if there were some watchtowers with knights guarding. If there is player (taxpayer of course) in danger, knights must help him. Also they deal with griefers / vandals.
Now there is never only one king on a map which is 8 times the size of earth. So kings can be either allies or enemies. They have to lay their borders and keep their soldiers on watch as enemy might attack at any time. Enemies (or friendlies) can send spies to spy on you (logish). 

More ideas : 

*Currency should be either iron coins or cold coins or both. 10 iron coins = 1 gold coin. (This was said some pages back but with bars). Otherwise iron bars.
*Peasants are not allowed to own any diamond bars / blocks / items. Once peasant has found diamond in a mine (or laying around as items) he has to inform king or his servants. He will get payed if he does inform. (lets say 3 gold bars).
However if peasant tries to hide it, but he gets caught he has to pay penalty.
Other peasants can inform too if one is hiding. Lets say one has sealed his diamond mine with dirt. Next day he goes to check but someone sees him digging into said mine. That someone can now inform knight about secret mine. That someone gets a prize if that mine is found. (I hope I explained this part well)
*Same should go with flint. As flint can be crafted into Flint and Steel which can cause fire.

This should be all. Of course this idea would only work in roleplaying server. As random knight could just kill the king for the heck of it.[/QUOTE]
Why would anyone choose to play as a peasant or knight? People would just leave the King in his big empty castle."
