We would probably just have a really hidden ninja hideout then we can decide from there what we want to do. probably take over castles and either claim them ours. (tag them somehow) or sell them for more ninja supplies. i.e.: we send one of us in plan clothes into town and say we have a castle for sale then only take food, diamond, bows/arrows for payment. (we wouldnt need anything else) The seller would tell the ninjas to hurry up and vacate before the buyer shows up so they wont know they bought a house that was stolen. seeing as out ninja hideout will be so well hidden (and we would not carry very much with us) it would be very hard for people to get revenge. and we would have a skin we would use when &quot;ninja-ing&quot; with an insignia for our own ninja clan, otherwise you could use your own skin. Also we will use a 3rd party chat system for communication. Yeah:

I think that you should be allowed to define clientside whether you want to be a part of it or not. Not meaning you can&#39;t attack or be attacked. Now remember when notch said he&#39;d add land claim flags to define an area as yours? (As seen on todo list.) . I think that even without being a part of pvp, if you&#39;re in someone else&#39;s land claim they can kill you."

The skins can double as disguises! We could leave a marker near houses that are to be raided (if our ninja pals didn&#39;t get wind of this) but make it really well hidden.. ie a chest hidden under a tree or something, with a note in it stating the time and place! :D

I was in my little house and I had just one little window. I hear something outside, I approach the window and BAM a big ugly skeleton stands there. I literally screamed &quot;IIIIUUUUAAAH!&quot; with a not so manly voice. :v:</span>

I think that you should be allowed to define clientside whether you want to be a part of it or not. Not meaning you can&#39;t attack or be attacked. Now remember when notch said he&#39;d add land claim flags to define an area as yours? (As seen on todo list.) . I think that even without being a part of pvp, if you&#39;re in someone else&#39;s land claim they can kill you.[/QUOTE]

PVP should be serverside.. and this is why people are considering setting up a private FP server! So unlawful PVP results in exile from the main town, and maybe even bannings! :cop:

&quot;This will be great, we can have people flanking in on the left while we launch a sneak attack on the right, some people can rush and distract them!.&quot;

Thats the beauty of it. not everybody has to RP. if they dont they can just stay in the main city. otherwise we can attack people whenever we want if they are out in the wilderness. Obviously we wont go and kill somebody who is just on his own. Probably only large settlements and stuff.

There is no silver. That is iron. Maybe gold bars, but people will probably trade anything for anything. Some form of economy will arise at least :eng101:
