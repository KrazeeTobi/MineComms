[1:24] <vurtual> I can't run anything in a double-monitor setup in the style of one-thing-on-two-screens because the monitors are different shapes and it'd be trippy.

[1:38] <bildramer> I'm not going to pretend I care
[1:38] <vurtual> Anyone have ideas on how to have seperate wallpapers on each monitor?
[1:38] <vurtual> I know a program I can use, but still.
[1:38] <CrazySpai> vurtual: Yeah
[1:38] <bildramer> vurtual: MS Paint, copypasta
[1:38] <bildramer> why not
[1:39] <CrazySpai> Ultramon, Displayfusion, multimonm

[1:39] <TheClassiestMedic> fuggle
[1:39] <vurtual> yeah trying displayfusion
[1:39] <bildramer> um
[1:39] <bildramer> can't you just make a single image show up in both?
[1:39] <vurtual> why would I want THAT?
[1:39] <vurtual> Also this should counteract the whole "07 and 04 monitors that look wildly different" problem
[1:39] <bildramer> whatever
[1:39] <KodaichiZero> Ultramon? sounds like something I'd want in MY pokedex
[1:39] <vurtual> digimon
[1:39] <CrazySpai> KodaichiZero: inno rite?
[1:39] <vurtual> so that my 04 monitor can have a darker, more friendly background
[1:40] <vurtual> also for once I got the screws in tight enough that it isn't falling apart.
[1:40] <KodaichiZero> true. but nobody knows what digimon is anymore

[1:54] <KodaichiZero> that eliminates 95% of them
[1:55] <Lukisod> doesn't that defeat the purpose of fanfic?
[1:55] <KodaichiZero> yeah but if you can write a decent story using only official characters, I think it's a much bigger accomplishment
[1:56] <KodaichiZero> romance is okay, but teenagers cannot write romance

[2:00] <KodaichiZero> lots of creeper attacks, skellys, whatever
[2:00] <Lukisod> griefers?
[2:01] <KodaichiZero> ending will probably be something tragic, like turns out she's a dude or just kills him for it

[2:13] <Iguana> But you spent 58 hours...
[2:13] <Iguana> I'm confused.
[2:13] <Visiiri> Iguana: The week ends at 5:00PM Friday
[2:13] <Iguana> :o
[2:13] <Visiiri> I played twelve hours non stop then
[2:13] <Lukisod> it technically has about 55 from when you get off work
[2:13] <Visiiri> That's about accurate
[2:13] <Visiiri> and I don't get off at 5
[2:14] <Visiiri> I get off at 2:30
[2:14] <Lukisod> then you have more time
[2:14] <Visiiri> So, out of the whole weekend, I played alot.
[2:14] <Visiiri> I've nearly completely completed.
[2:14] <Visiiri> I missed a single terminal after the Omega 4 relay
[2:14] <Visiiri> and plan to go back in later.

[2:36] <Naxza> I'll disagree with that opinion on hacks.
[2:36] <Naxza> What about Super Mario World ROM hacks, for instance?
[2:36] <LuciferZ> No way man. There is no spirit to the game except the spirit players bring to it.
[2:37] <vurtual> playing games with a second blank monitor is trippy

[2:40] <Naxza> I kid, I'm not.
[2:40] <Lukisod> give 'er
[2:41] <Lukisod> airlocks are a system where by you hold up sand/gravel blocks with torches so when water flows in they delete the torches and drops the sand/gravel

[2:44] <Lukisod> try to hook up enough so that each moniter is it's own pixel in a much larger display
[2:44] <vurtual> I printed out a bunch of little paper guides, that tell you where in the gigantic 2D array that monitor is.
[2:44] <vurtual> And you can even move them around.

[3:44] <Iguana> Or something?
[3:44] <dexexe1234> well i made a silly little house in MineCraft, and my normal chat buddies said that i should post it in here: http://i39.tinypic.com/2zs4t55.png
[3:44] <vurtual> not bad
[3:44] <LuciferZ> Pretty nice.
[3:45] <LuciferZ> Bigger than anything I've built in indev, lol.
[3:45] <vurtual> Also, why does it feel so nice in here.
[3:45] <dexexe1234> also the sheep and pigs are having a rave in my tower
[3:45] <dexexe1234> damn you sheep and pigs!
[3:45] <CrazySpai> vurtual: People have stopped being trolling dicks?
[3:45] <vurtual> No like, in my room.
[3:45] <CrazySpai> Did the AC turn on?
[3:45] <vurtual> we have no AC in this room
[3:45] <vurtual> Is my monitor releasing relaxation power?
[3:45] <dexexe1234> also, with my silly little construction, i plan on having four things connected by that bridge
[3:46] <CrazySpai> Did your fart finally disappate?
[3:46] <vurtual> Is the dual monitor setup some sort of euphoric wonder?
[3:46] <CrazySpai> vurtual: It is.
[3:46] <CrazySpai> It is.

[3:46] <CrazySpai> dexexe1234: Just wait
[3:46] <dexexe1234> filled to the brim with minecrafting people
[3:46] <dexexe1234> hmm?
[3:47] <Animator> Oh hey, AlNaTuRaLx lives again.
[3:47] <CrazySpai> dexexe1234: It's generally not this nice. Everyone must be tired.

[3:47] * ILM (ILM@75.97.111.168.res-cmts.senj.ptd.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:47] <vurtual> I was gonna play some music
[3:47] <vurtual> But I have absolutely no relaxing music at all
[3:47] <Iguana> Really?
[3:47] <ILM> sup?
[3:47] <vurtual> I've never even listened to "relaxing" music before.
[3:47] <CrazySpai> vurtual: Just ask Animator what i was streaming last night
[3:47] <ILM> vurtual: I suggest some Ratatat
[3:47] <Cial> monday is "talk about minecraft day" tomorrow its gonna go to hell in a handbasket
[3:47] <vurtual> Hm, too bad I can't half-alt-tab
[3:47] <CrazySpai> I went from DnB to Amon Amoth
[3:47] <vurtual> and make my right monitor stop being something
[3:48] <LuciferZ> Vurtual, try this: http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/ballad-of-awakening
[3:48] <vurtual> It's like wearing an eyepatch now though
[3:48] <dexexe1234> This is also relaxing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSg6talwzbU
[3:48] <Darke> Animator, I dont see X
[3:48] <vurtual> due to my monitor split
[3:48] <CrazySpai> vurtual: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz-ExsTjafQ
[3:49] <CrazySpai> Relaxing
[3:49] <Darke> Oh and does anyone know of that program that makes your monitor basically change hue depending on time of the day?
[3:49] <CrazySpai> Darke: I SO WISH.
[3:49] <ILM> I remember that
[3:49] <Darke> Wait...
[3:49] <CrazySpai> It's a bitch to blind yourself.
[3:49] <Darke> Ohyeah!
[3:49] <Darke> f.lux
[3:49] <ILM> It made my screen all yellow
[3:49] <Darke> http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/
[3:49] <Animator> Darke, he's kingnerd.
[3:49] <CrazySpai> ILM: Do you have a mac?
[3:49] <Darke> Animator, oh I se
[3:49] <ILM> I run archlinux
[3:50] <Darke> Animator, he still isn't here?
[3:50] <Iguana> What.
[3:50] <CrazySpai> Darke: I <3 you good sir.
[3:50] <vurtual> no THIS
[3:50] <Iguana> I don't see him anywhere.
[3:50] <Iguana> Animator is a liar.
[3:50] <Iguana> Burn the witch.
[3:50] <ILM> If you'd like to see it, since I am a bit of a narcissist, I can take a screenshot
[3:50] <ILM> in fact, I think I will!
[3:50] <Animator> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=11975
[3:50] <Darke> Iguana, you get the torches, I'll get the cotton candy.
[3:50] <Animator> That is him.
[3:50] <Darke> Oh jeez forums.
[3:50] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3nV6WqA4Y0
[3:50] <Darke> Ew
[3:50] <vurtual> THIS is relaxing
[3:51] <CrazySpai> EWWWWWWW
[3:51] <CrazySpai> My screen is all yellow
[3:51] <Animator> YEAH YOU BETTER TAKE THOSE FORUMS IN THE MOUTH YEAH SHOVE IT IN THERE.
[3:51] <dexexe1234> ok guys, who peed on CrazySpai's screen? Come on new i want to see fingers here people!
[3:51] <CrazySpai> dexexe1234: :3. f.lux sux
[3:51] <Darke> CrazySpai, no not really
[3:52] <dexexe1234> all a matter on how you feel about it
[3:52] <dexexe1234> we all have opinions
[3:52] <Darke> It's just that it was a very dramatic change. It's much more soothing if you actually let it work normally
[3:52] <CrazySpai> It discolors it.
[3:52] <Darke> Yeah
[3:52] <Darke> ...
[3:52] <Darke> Changes the hue
[3:52] <CrazySpai> I could... attempt to use it
[3:52] <vurtual> What we'll see... will defy explinaaation
[3:52] <Darke> You can adjust also
[3:53] <Darke> It takes getting used to
[3:53] <dexexe1234> i dont think my screen could handle it. The last guy who owned it had first discovered the wheel in his late 50'ies
[3:53] <LuciferZ> Jesus is that thread for real, Animator? Did that guy seriously make a thread detailing an exploit but not the fix?
[3:53] <CrazySpai> Yeah, I believe so.
[3:54] <Animator> That thread is for real.
[3:54] <LuciferZ> What a tit
[3:54] <Animator> And that thread does not say the exploit, it only says what was already common knowledge.
[3:54] <Iguana> Dude.
[3:54] <Iguana> Allnaturnalx is doing some stupid shit.
[3:54] <Animator> If he says the fix, he also says the complete exploit with it.
[3:54] <AndrewPH> The exploit is spoofing a nick with a unicode nick
[3:54] <LuciferZ> Common knowledge in the sense that no one uses it?
[3:55] <Animator> Wait a damn.
[3:55] <LuciferZ> I'd never heard of it, and yet it apparently still works on most servers. That doesn't sound like common knowledge.
[3:55] <AndrewPH> The fix would probably be for notch to implement a clientside character stripper
[3:55] <Animator> AndrewPH, I think that's already been mentioned once or twice about that exploit.
[3:55] <Darke> LuciferZ, it really is common knoweledge, a lot of people knew about it
[3:55] <LuciferZ> He gave enough information for someone like BeardBeard to figure out the exploit.
[3:55] <CrazySpai> Animator: May I PM j00?
[3:55] <Animator> Wait wait wait.
[3:56] <ILM> CrazySpai: why did you think I had a mac?
[3:56] <ILM> just out of curiosity
[3:56] <CrazySpai> ILM: Yellow screen comment.
[3:56] <Animator> Andrew, is this the same exploit that was mentioned months ago about the really long names?
[3:56] <AndrewPH> No
[3:56] <Animator> Or is it something completely different?
[3:56] <CrazySpai> There is a flaw in the big screened macs.
[3:56] <Animator> Oh.
[3:56] <AndrewPH> this is just unicode names
[3:56] <Darke> LuciferZ, do you know who kingnerd is? He has done some really stupid shit before
[3:56] <CrazySpai> There are quadrents that are yellow.
[3:56] <AndrewPH> Which are stripped out by D3, my myne mod, and apparently mcsharp
[3:56] <LuciferZ> He seems vaguely familiar
[3:56] <ILM> CrazySpai: I meant f.lux. It turns your screen yellow to stop glare or some nonsense
[3:56] <Yourself> <AndrewPH> The exploit is spoofing a nick with a unicode nick
[3:56] <Animator> It's AlNaTuRaLx, sillies.
[3:57] <Darke> Yes
[3:57] <Yourself> actually you can do it with anything that prints characters to the screen
[3:57] <Animator> The name is right in the post.
[3:57] <CrazySpai> ILM: Yeah, I didn't realize you were in the convo
[3:57] <ILM> ??(??_o)/??
[3:57] <Yourself> in fact, if you send a message with a single &, it'll do it
[3:57] <Yourself> there's also some non-unicode ascii characters that can do it
[3:57] <AndrewPH> Yourself, The name is the one though, as you just have to join and not exit
[3:57] <Animator> AndrewPH, is there enough information on that post to show how to do it?
[3:57] <AndrewPH> the irc bold character, when combined with spaces or nothing, crashes
[3:58] <AndrewPH> Animator, probably not
[3:58] <AndrewPH> although with Myner being out
[3:58] <AndrewPH> There's no direct information and you'd have to know what you're doing
[3:58] <Darke> Anyways, I don't even play online Minecraft anymore. I really cannot stand custom servers

[3:58] <LuciferZ> So what if someone interested in using it PMs him for the fix?
[3:58] <Yourself> my point is it's not a problem with names, but a problem with printing text in the client
[3:58] <AndrewPH> Yourself, I know
[3:58] <AndrewPH> He's using names to do it though

[3:59] <CrazySpai> Animator: Do you have a second?
[3:59] <Animator> Hm. Is there any solution for vanilla servers from this exploit?
[3:59] <Animator> And yes, I do.
[3:59] * dexexe1234 (Mibbit@93.164.186.61) has left #minecraft
[3:59] <AndrewPH> Only notch can fix it
[3:59] <Animator> I have many seconds.
[4:00] <Darke> So on other matters guys, what has happened with hacks lately?
[4:00] * Animator shows closet full of second-long clocks.
[4:00] <AndrewPH> And the easiest way to fix it has not have the mc client die when it can't print a character.
[4:00] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[4:00] <Yourself> for example, by having it skip said character
[4:00] <AndrewPH> That's how my mod of myne does it
[4:00] <AndrewPH> (replaces it with nothing)
[4:01] <Darke> D: Nobody likes guy who knows nothing

[4:03] <Darke> Seems a little hard to learn anything about what has been happening lately regarding those topics (hacks, custom servers) without searching through the forums.
[4:03] <Darke> Which is not an experience I want to undertake :/
[4:04] <Cial> Darke: #ccoalition
[4:04] <Darke> Ew
[4:05] <Cial> what?
[4:05] <Darke> Just ew designers of custom stuff
[4:05] <Darke> ithink
[4:06] <Cial> ..............................................................................you want to know about it but you dont want to ask the devs of it
[4:06] <Animator> Darke, if you're not willing to get down and dirty to find the information that you crave, stop bothering people that are telling you the answer that you so abruptly deny.
[4:06] <Darke> Oh I'm just trying to be a pest right now I guess
[4:06] <Darke> Procrastination is boring :/
[4:06] <Animator> I don't like pests.

[4:10] <Darke> What?
[4:10] <Animator> Ergo I sometimes end up thinking that some custom server threads are against the rules on the forums when it's in the IRC.
[4:11] <Visiiri> Maybe you should retire from both and be a loser like the rest of us? :)
[4:11] <Animator> Ahahaha, no.

[4:23] <vurtual> these burgers are normally bland and not good
[4:24] <vurtual> add cheese, then later onion, get delicious burger.
[4:24] <vurtual> previous burgers were anything from bland
[4:24] <vurtual> to Fry's reaction to eating a recycled sandwich during the gigantic garbage ball episode of Futurama.
[4:24] <vurtual> due to eating a burger that was practically made from other burgers
[4:25] <vurtual> incl/ tomato too!
[4:25] <revenant> I want a double cheesburger hold the lettuce...
[4:26] <revenant> don't be frontin' son no seeds on a bun...

[4:26] <vurtual> or maybe the brontosaurus scene from Jurassic Park
[4:27] <vurtual> previous burgers: Boat ride, or one of the scary jurassic park scenes.

[6:06] <TheClassiestMedic> Send me the map, I might be able to fix it
[6:07] <Zach_> ]Visiiri your valve person has to be loyal
[6:07] <Zach_> or they die
[6:09] <Luki> and they have to be the right people for the jobs you send them to do
[6:09] <]Visiiri> Alright
[6:09] <]Visiiri> All of my team was loyal
[6:09] <Zach_> then tali shouldn't die
[6:09] <]Visiiri> except for Tali, Leigon, the assassin.
[6:10] <]Visiiri> :\
[6:10] <Zach_> :P
[6:10] <Luki> I know... using legion to open the locks and having garrus lead the first team wokred for me
[6:10] <Zach_> you need either legion or tali to be loyal
[6:10] <Luki> you should have everyone loyal
[6:10] <]Visiiri> Hmm
[6:10] <Zach_> they're the two to put in the valves
[6:10] <]Visiiri> Why not our tech guy?
[6:10] <]Visiiri> I mean, clearly, the schizo is a good idea.
[6:10] <Zach_> tbf, they have the coolest loyalty missions too
[6:10] <Luki> word
[6:10] <]Visiiri> Grunt's was cooler
[6:10] <]Visiiri> I took miranda and him on my team

[6:11] <]Visiiri> Hmm
[6:11] <]Visiiri> K
[6:11] <]Visiiri> Anything else I should know?
[6:11] <Zach_> how do you know grunts was cooler if you haven't done them :/
[6:11] <]Visiiri> Who to take/who to put on the head of the other team?
[6:11] <]Visiiri> :( I don't.
[6:11] <Zach_> i did zaeed
[6:11] <]Visiiri> Zaeed?
[6:11] <]Visiiri> wut
[6:11] <Luki> dont use grunt to lead the second set of distraction teams
[6:11] <]Visiiri> No, he was my second hand
[6:11] <Zach_> you need a soldier class to lead the people back to the ship i think
[6:11] <Zach_> thane would work probably
[6:11] <]Visiiri> Him + Me + Miranda = first squad
[6:12] <Zach_> i used garrus as my second leader all the time
[6:12] <]Visiiri> Thane + Jacob + someone else = second squad
[6:12] <]Visiiri> That creepy schizo was the spec
[6:12] <]Visiiri> I think I need to upgrade the ship
[6:12] <]Visiiri> and get more lyalty though

[6:12] <vurtual> I wish steam let you show/hide multiple categories

[6:55] <vurtual> you know what'd be cool as a pokemon move

[6:56] <vurtual> only one could attack
[6:56] * TestDummy is now known as TD|L4D2
[6:56] <Cial> why not just do a two on two battle?
[6:56] <vurtual> and only the pokemon you had "out" would be targeted, but some of the damage would be absorbed by the user of a move.
[6:56] <vurtual> so you could be in a one on one battle, use a move on your pokemon and boom, send out another pokemon then the other can attack and absorb damage
[6:56] <Animator> I feel like having an Aggron now.
[6:57] * Cial has a Shiny Umbreon

[9:27] <Dys|sleep> and hosting a server
[9:27] <Dys|sleep> is a bad idea :l
[9:27] <bildramer> lol PuyoDead
[9:27] <bildramer> so, when was the last time Notch came?
[9:28] <bildramer> came to the channel* o.o;

[9:28] <Azathoth> so was i
[9:28] <Azathoth> wut
[9:28] <bildramer> ...
[9:28] <LG_Legacy> Notch was last seen three days ago
[9:28] <bildramer> well
[9:28] <bildramer> we must talk to him about the oplessness
[9:29] <bildramer> sometimes spammers/etc./trolls come and nobody is able to kickban them
[9:29] <bildramer> because all the ops are AFK
[9:29] <Dys|sleep> I could be a op
[9:29] <Dys|sleep> or LG
[9:29] <bildramer> or just trolling >_>
[9:29] <bildramer> well, yeah
[9:29] <Azathoth> i think i would make the best op
[9:29] <bildramer> anyone could be
[9:29] <bildramer> *cough*
[9:29] <bildramer> bbl
[9:30] <Azathoth> because i never break the server rules
[9:30] <Azathoth> ever
[9:30] <Dys|sleep> same :v
[9:30] <Azathoth> >_>
[9:30] <Azathoth> <_<

[9:31] <yoshibot> i need torches
[9:31] <yoshibot> coal
[9:31] <yoshibot> where
[9:31] <bildramer> I'm here like 90% of the time
[9:31] <outsomnia|Clinton> [22:30] <yoshibot> oh god, does infdev in the daytime become mob hell?
[9:31] <bildramer> this sucks ;_:
[9:31] <vurtual> bildramer would probably do well at opping
[9:31] <Azathoth> bildramer is OP

[9:32] <yoshibot> i hate how you can't make a long fire without coal
[9:32] <yoshibot> or way more wood than would go into a real campfire

[9:33] <Azathoth> coal is easy as dickens to find
[9:33] <Dys|sleep> where you chase monsters
[9:33] <Dys|sleep> and actually find a monster
[9:33] <Dys|sleep> and it chases you :(
[9:33] <Azathoth> you can often find it in the sides of cliffs
[9:33] <Dys|sleep> and you cant make a sound
[9:33] <Azathoth> monsters aren't real, dumbass
[9:34] <Dys|sleep> Big foot :(
[9:34] <Azathoth> they call me big foot
[9:34] <Azathoth> only instead of foot, it's another body part

[9:34] <Azathoth> no

[10:11] * PyroWorks is now known as fragmer__
[10:11] <vurtual> just games like quake 2

[10:11] <vurtual> now to re-validate and hope it doesn't try to REDOWNLOAD EVERY FILE

[10:12] <vurtual> It did once
[10:12] <Speljohan_> last time i checked, steam downloaded a massive package which is then extracted
[10:12] <vurtual> why does steam decide to like... ignore the gcf content thingy
[10:12] <Speljohan_> see my previous statement
[10:12] <Speljohan_> cus steam sux
[10:12] <Speljohan_> !
[10:12] <vurtual> gasp
[10:12] <vurtual> it's an ncf.
[10:12] <vurtual> which doesn't actually contain anything
[10:13] <Speljohan_> tbh i'd use steam if it wasn't for the random lockups and the terrible ui
[10:13] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:13] <vurtual> isntead of the backup gcf
[10:13] <vurtual> also, gasp 2, I got the directory wrong

[10:16] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:16] <Speljohan_> steam needs faster servers too!
[10:16] <Speljohan_> swedes get shit speeds
[10:16] <vurtual> no you don't
[10:17] <Speljohan_> and no, not compared to our standards
[10:17] <vurtual> lots of people in that area get good speeds
[10:17] <Speljohan_> my steam always fluctuate between 400kb/s and 800kb/s
[10:17] <vurtual> I get 60kbyte to the hogshead and that's the way I likes it
[10:17] <Speljohan_> goes up/down constantly
[10:17] <vurtual> that had better be kbit boy, or I'll flog you so many hogsheads.
[10:17] <Speljohan_> pissy speeds for a product if i pay for it
[10:17] <vurtual> sooo many hogsheads
[10:17] <Speljohan_> so i usually end up buying game on steam
[10:17] <vurtual> no really is that 400-800kbit or kbyte
[10:17] <Speljohan_> then downloading on usenet
[10:17] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:17] <Speljohan_> byrwe
[10:17] <Speljohan_> byte*
[10:17] <vurtual> okay
[10:17] <Speljohan_> obviously
[10:17] <vurtual> you cannot complain
[10:18] <vurtual> at all
[10:18] <JTE> Minecraft on Steam would be neat.
[10:18] <Speljohan_> yes i can
[10:18] <vurtual> My entire internet connection is 60kbyte
[10:18] <Speljohan_> if you pay for a game you expect full speed
[10:18] <vurtual> sixty.
[10:18] <Speljohan_> if you pay for a game you expect full speed
[10:18] <Speljohan_> doesn't matter what connection speed you have
[10:18] <vurtual> you're getting 400-800
[10:18] <vurtual> which is just fine.
[10:18] <Speljohan_> which is far from my max
[10:18] <vurtual> and?
[10:18] <Speljohan_> and takes forever if a game is 10gb
[10:18] <vurtual> I have to spend TWO DAYS downloading some games.
[10:18] <vurtual> TWO. DAYS.
[10:18] <Speljohan_> yes, but it isn't relevant vurtual, you get your max speed
[10:18] <vurtual> In which, until recently, the internet would stop functioning
[10:18] <Speljohan_> i do not
[10:19] <vurtual> You're whining that you are not getting "max speed"
[10:19] <Speljohan_> i'm whining because something that would take 1h, 30m takes 8h
[10:19] <vurtual> while downloading nearly ten times as fast, to more than ten times as fast.
[10:19] <vurtual> Also, change servers.
[10:19] <Speljohan_> i have tried, no success
[10:19] <vurtual> all of them?
[10:19] <vurtual> every last download server?
[10:19] <Speljohan_> cbf to go through all
[10:19] <vurtual> okay
[10:19] <vurtual> you're whining
[10:19] <Speljohan_> a few in europe
[10:19] <Drewseph> okay
[10:19] <Speljohan_> etc
[10:19] <Drewseph> time to duplicate my map
[10:19] <Drewseph> and light it on fire for real
[10:20] <vurtual> then saying "Well I cannot spend time to actually use a very functional fix, and would rather whine."
[10:20] <vurtual> And that's terrible.
[10:20] <Speljohan_> other digital download services give me full speed
[10:20] <Speljohan_> why not steam
[10:20] <vurtual> steam has to host literally every game out there
[10:20] <vurtual> and handle millions of people
[10:20] <Speljohan_> steam should easily be able to detect the server that's fastest for me
[10:20] <Drewseph> in any case does anyone know if saplings grow into the awesome new trees, or do they just turn into old trees?

[10:21] <vurtual> NEED YOUR MOMMY?
[10:21] <Speljohan_> cd in mail would be best!

[10:21] <vurtual> well tough
[10:21] <vurtual> My friend has dial-up
[10:21] <vurtual> the downlaod speeds are measurable best in bytes
[10:21] <Speljohan_> i used to have dial-up too
[10:21] <Speljohan_> 4kb/s max speed
[10:21] <vurtual> he still plays steam games fine
[10:21] <Speljohan_> sometimes 5kb/s if i was lucky
[10:21] <vurtual> 4kb would be like
[10:21] <vurtual> 8x his speeds
[10:22] <Speljohan_> wow
[10:22] <vurtual> he still downloads
[10:22] <Speljohan_> so he doesn't even have 56,6k?
[10:22] <vurtual> over weeks or months
[10:22] <vurtual> waiting
[10:22] <Speljohan_> i see no point downloading at those speeds
[10:22] <Speljohan_> it would be both cheaper and faster
[10:22] <Speljohan_> to buy it
[10:22] <Speljohan_> in store
[10:22] <vurtual> not doing anything, not able to download overnight
[10:22] <vurtual> There's no stores in his state.
[10:22] <Speljohan_> wtf
[10:22] <vurtual> If he were to somehow learn to drive, get a car, gas, and directions
[10:22] <Speljohan_> how can there be no stores?
[10:22] <Speljohan_> ps
[10:22] <vurtual> he would have to drive for ages upon ages
[10:22] <Speljohan_> internet
[10:22] <Speljohan_> is for buying

[11:43] <vurtual> a real map
[11:43] <vurtual> like I used to for Source.
[11:43] <vurtual> before sorta dropping that due to my recent quake-playing, and being caught up in the old-style design fun

[11:45] <AndrewPH> run in compatibility mode
[11:45] <AndrewPH> / a vm
[11:46] <vurtual> I don't think vista can do a compatability for a 16-bit program
[11:46] <vurtual> and a vm isn't happening
[11:46] <AndrewPH> I've never had trouble running 16-bit programs on 32bit vista or 7
[11:46] <AndrewPH> why isn't a vm happening
[11:47] <vurtual> because I could, theoretically
[11:47] <vurtual> try to see if hammer can communicate with the old compile tool
[11:48] <vurtual> (Rather than freaking out due to the fact that it's a shockingly different amount of things, or just making it think I made a map of HURDFHURRRHHbzzzz010101110durp)
[11:48] <vurtual> I, technically, could try to move over my game files, compile quake 2, then run worldcraft in wine.

[11:50] <vurtual> I don't think that's a rape face

[11:50] <Dys-sleep> get on the zombie server
[11:50] <Dys-sleep> gazz10 be haxin
[11:50] <Drewseph> the fire spread so fast I could not control it!
[11:50] <LG_Legacy> What
[11:51] <Dys-sleep> some guy gazz10 keeps flying aorund
[11:51] <Drewseph> so I used my 21 TNT's to try to blow up the tree leaves
[11:51] <FakeSky> It didn't work?
[11:51] <Drewseph> I almost got it but the fire spread still
[11:51] <Drewseph> Notch, I just wanted to say, I LOVE what you did with fire
[11:51] <Drewseph> puts up the perfect fight =)
[11:51] <Notch> :D
[11:52] <FakeSky> We need Firefighter Golems
[11:52] <FakeSky> Or just, Water Golems.
[11:52] <Drewseph> I spent the next 3 hours making clearings in the thinnest part of the forest
[11:52] <vurtual> seriously I just, seriously.
[11:52] <Drewseph> I managed to get a ton of sapplings
[11:52] <vurtual> I think that 10 dollars was not worth this
[11:52] <Drewseph> after the fire died out I replanted the landscape
[11:52] <vurtual> I want like, 50 dollars, just for being lured into dealing with this.
[11:52] <Drewseph> do sapplings turn into the awesome new trees? or just the old ones?
[11:53] <vurtual> Notch, here's an important word of advice about not dying: Always make sure that there is an sdk.
[11:53] <vurtual> for anything you do
[11:53] <Drewseph> Vurtual huh?
[11:53] <Notch> what?
[11:53] <Drewseph> what you rambling about?
[11:54] <vurtual> Or chances are, it'll only be a matter of time before someone kills you due to incredibly inconsistent third-party support.
[11:54] <Drewseph> vurtual, maybe you shouldn't joke like that >_>
[11:54] <Notch> i take it you ran into some badly supported software?

[11:55] <Drewseph> Notch, did you see what I asked about trees and sapplings?
[11:55] <Notch> no, I missed it
[11:55] <Drewseph> do sapplings turn into the awesome new trees? or just the old ones?
[11:56] <Notch> oh, good question!
[11:56] <Drewseph> the ones I planted so far are just all old trees
[11:56] <Notch> I think the old one actually
[11:56] <Drewseph> =(
[11:56] <Speljohan_> sup Notch
[11:56] <LG_Legacy> Fail
[11:56] <Drewseph> that makes me sad
[11:56] <LG_Legacy> The UrT server went down
[11:56] <Drewseph> I just filled an entire hillside with them
[11:56] <Notch> hey hey
[11:56] <LG_Legacy> Dys-sleep Kick to check for ghost/flying
[11:56] <LG_Legacy> Always
[11:56] <Drewseph> I was hoping to have a forest like the one that was there originally
[11:56] <Notch> I will fix it right away
[11:56] <Speljohan_> nice weather is too nice Notch
[11:56] <Dys-sleep> Ok
[11:56] <Speljohan_> i get the on monitor/eyes
[11:56] <Speljohan_> :(
[11:56] <Speljohan_> sun
[11:56] <Drewseph> YAY
[11:57] <Drewseph> thanks Notch!
[11:57] <Notch> haha, same here
[11:57] <Notch> it's looking like a really beatiful day today
[11:57] <Speljohan_> yesterday was wonderful
[11:57] <Drewseph> Also I love the mob system
[11:57] <Speljohan_> 16 degrees
[11:57] <Notch> I actually went for a morning walk first thing today
[11:57] <Speljohan_> today it's a bit colder
[11:57] <Speljohan_> but the weather is still awesome
[11:57] <Speljohan_> yeah Notch as did i!
[11:57] <Drewseph> I think that there should be another setting, Insanity, and the mobs spawn in HUGE groups like they do now
[11:57] <Drewseph> =)
[11:58] <Notch> Saphehe
[11:58] <Speljohan_> i had an epic sleep this night as well
[11:58] <Speljohan_> 13 hours straight
[11:58] <Serow> Notch, would leaf blocks we can place be a possibility? I'd like to build (and disguise) tree houses, but it's difficult carving a good home into trees, even the new ones.
[11:58] <Speljohan_> i feel like a new man!
[11:58] <Drewseph> I wish I could go for a nice walk in the wilderness
[11:58] <Speljohan_> i have forest close to house Drewseph
[11:58] <Speljohan_> and an awesome fishing-river
[11:58] <Drewseph> I wonder what Notch plans for today =0
[11:59] <Drewseph> =)*
[11:59] <Dys-sleep> Uhm lg
[11:59] <Dys-sleep> gazz10 is still here :/
[11:59] <Dys-sleep> even with /whois
[11:59] <Dys-sleep> it still says undead_zombie
[11:59] <Drewseph> my birthday is today
[11:59] <Speljohan_> Notch plans to deceive you all by implementing a level system and quests
[11:59] <Speljohan_> to keep you all busy
[11:59] <Speljohan_> !!!
[11:59] <Drewseph> 28
[11:59] <Speljohan_> quests as in, kill 5 sheep, bring wool to npc
[11:59] <Drewseph> nice number
[11:59] <Drewseph> I hope
[12:00] <LG_Legacy> Dys-sleep

[12:00] <LG_Legacy> The only way to destroy him is to restart the server
[12:00] <Dys-sleep> ahk
[12:00] <Dys-sleep> Im used to removing them on my server
[12:00] <Dys-sleep> by turning them into a bot

[12:10] <vurtual> I went through four different quake/quake 2 editors
[12:10] <vurtual> None of them were usable.
[12:11] <Drewseph> yes
[12:11] <vurtual> I found one that maybe, given a few hours, I could sloooowly drag together a tiny box map.
[12:11] <Drewseph> today is that special day >_>
[12:11] <Yourself> i hate when people say "wow" as if having a birthday is unusual
[12:11] <Drewseph> I turn teh 28
[12:11] <vurtual> being born on hitler day/420?
[12:11] <Yourself> make it sound like they've never met anyone who's been born before
[12:11] <vurtual> that's like, a one in 365 chance, or LESS, not counting probability!
[12:11] <Drewseph> don't forget Nepolean

[12:13] <Drewseph> am I important?
[12:14] <Drewseph> I don't think I am
[12:14] <vurtual> Apparently.
[12:14] <Drewseph> I just make puzzles
[12:14] <Yourself> your name isn't on the list of births on 4/20 on wikipedia
[12:14] <Yourself> so you're not important
[12:14] <vurtual> So wait, maybe Muh-whatever was trying to become a world conqueror
[12:14] <Drewseph> and made a metroid hack
[12:14] <vurtual> hitler became one
[12:14] <vurtual> but could not be in art very well
[12:14] <vurtual> George Takei was an actor which is close
[12:14] <vurtual> what did he always want to do, but couldn't?

[12:17] <Superwafflez> Q3 right?
[12:17] <Yourself> yes
[12:17] <vurtual> quake/quake2 mostly
[12:17] <vurtual> gtkradiant sucks though
[12:17] <Yourself> and expanded would be more appropriate
[12:17] <Drewseph> man, notch likes ot get all dissapeared on us
[12:18] <Superwafflez> yah
[12:18] <Yourself> expanded violently
[12:18] <Drewseph> comes on, says a few things and bye bye

[12:41] <Notch> the optimization update is almost certainly coming out today
[12:42] <chibifs> Yay!
[12:42] <Yourself> hmm, maybe trees should regrow leaves
[12:42] <Yourself> that'll definitely slow the game back down again
[12:43] <chibifs> xP
[12:43] <LG_Legacy> Notch So yeah about that mob spawning?
[12:43] <Yourself> would make topiaries require maintenance :P
[12:44] <Yourself> unless you made them out of a built tree
[12:44] <chibifs> Yeah, really Notch, we need more mobs spawning in inf, it's not enough :(
[12:44] <Yourself> but you can't place leaves, so that doesn't matter
[12:44] <Wirtualnosc> Hey, Notch, I was thinking, about transparency in skins... Some cool effects can be used with it, but still, it isn't possible with them disabled, and I know you don't want people to cheat with invisibility, so maybe... Game should check if at least one box (hand, leg, body, head) has no "transparent pixels", and then render it? Otherwise, ignore transparency?
[12:44] <Yourself> holy damn, i've spent almost $500 at the steam store in the last year
[12:45] <Speljohan_> loll
[12:45] <Gyap01> Why are the leaves not disappearing
[12:46] <Yourself> because these are new trees
[12:46] <Gyap01> I'm lazy xD
[12:46] <Gyap01> I just leave them flying
[12:46] <Yourself> so are the trees
[12:46] <Gyap01> Still
[12:46] <Gyap01> They cant leave me flying
[12:46] <Gyap01> So..
[12:46] <Gyap01> I win
[12:47] <Yourself> or can they?
[12:47] <Yourself> maybe you just haven't given them a chance
[12:47] <Yourself> maybe they want to, but you won't let them cut off your legs
[12:47] <Yourself> you're a terrible person
[12:47] <Yourself> you should be ashamed

[13:02] <mnjiman> well mine is 78 by 58
[13:02] <Subhazard> It's so big, I had to build an offshore island just to hold it.
[13:02] <mnjiman> walls are 4 thick item, and is 15 stones high

[13:02] <mnjiman> the walls and corner towers are built atm

[13:04] <chibifs> Subhazard, a friend and I have a series of keeps and castles spanned across a large map connected with sky bridges. Massive builds are not impossible :)
[13:04] <mnjiman> which will be made mostly of stone and Cobblestone
[13:04] <Subhazard> I set the difficulty to hard, and nothing would fucking dare travel near my castle.

[13:05] <chibifs> In indev, not creative.
[13:05] <mnjiman> its
[13:05] <mnjiman> 10x10 atm
[13:05] <Subhazard> So shut up Chibi Fuck Stick
[13:05] <Subhazard> Mine's an island, the moat came with it.
[13:05] <Subhazard> I wish I could build a lava moat.
[13:05] <mnjiman> i have to divert water from small lakes in the area
[13:05] <mnjiman> I did Inland
[13:05] <Siiseli> please be less offensive Subhazard :|
[13:06] <mnjiman> O Sub
[13:06] <mnjiman> I remember my advice
[13:06] <mnjiman> plant trees for wood
[13:06] <Subhazard> Chibi
[13:06] <mnjiman> and use the timber
[13:06] <mnjiman> for your stone making
[13:06] <Subhazard> How did you AND A FRIEND make a castle in Indev?
[13:06] <mnjiman> PWNED!
[13:06] <mnjiman> I love you sub
[13:06] <chibifs> We use a cloud folder.

[13:12] <mnjiman> did that show?
[13:12] <Subhazard> this'll take forever to load.
[13:12] <chibifs> Yes, pretty :)
[13:13] <mnjiman> ok i didnt know if i did it correctly
[13:13] <mnjiman> ive died so many times falling lo
[13:13] <Subhazard> I'll let you know in august what I think of the picture
[13:14] <mnjiman> lol
[13:14] <mnjiman> ok ill make it smaller :O
[13:14] <chibifs> I like the thick walls. I usually only do my walls 3 thick, the 4 makes it seem much more massive :)
[13:15] <mnjiman> i may extend the towers and walls outwords with single stone columns if it gives it a nice effect
[13:15] <chibifs> I focus too much on horizontal size, I usually start by digging a quarry all the way to the bottom of the map, and then building up basement floors.
[13:16] <mnjiman> sorry Sub atm thats the best picture i can do, cuase my net died oddly and i cant play minecraft atm nor load new pages lol
[13:16] <mnjiman> Well
[13:16] <mnjiman> on this map
[13:16] <mnjiman> i started mining quarry
[13:16] <mnjiman> as i was building my castle
[13:16] <mnjiman> i accidentally fell into multiple shafts i created lol
[13:17] <chibifs> Hehe :)
[13:17] <Subhazard> I always make my shit at sea level.
[13:17] <Gyap01> Sub
[13:17] <mnjiman> i made this at the level my house was at
[13:17] <Gyap01> When's the save file gonna be on pub? xD
[13:17] <mnjiman> Ive been told to make my moat deep enough where i can put lava into it
[13:18] <Subhazard> WHEN IM DONE BUILDING MY CASTLE
[13:18] <mnjiman> AHH CAPS
[13:18] <chibifs> It's really fun to play with two people, because we play completely different styles. I make giant death quarries and castles, he makes complex winding caves and makes water flow around.
[13:18] <mnjiman> Sub did my castle load for you yet? :(
[13:18] <Subhazard> I can screenshot all my armor if you don't believe me, it'll take me FOREVER and a half to upload it to tinypic because my internet is pirated.

[13:19] <Subhazard> How long did that take you?
[13:19] <mnjiman> uh
[13:19] <mnjiman> well the stone from the moats took 5 hour per wall, and building each wall was an hour and a half
[13:20] <mnjiman> then the a few hours on each tower
[13:20] <Subhazard> My castle could fit in your castle.
[13:20] <Subhazard> How did you get water in there?
[13:20] <Subhazard> Christ.
[13:20] <Subhazard> And the mining?
[13:20] <Subhazard> Oh, you also use cobblestone.
[13:20] <mnjiman> ya like i said
[13:21] <Malikat> oh god
[13:21] <Subhazard> You don't have to wait on furnaces and you don't have to collect coal
[13:21] <Subhazard> Mine's made entirely of stone.
[13:21] <mnjiman> if someone tries to cock slap me
[13:21] <mnjiman> iliek your trying to do
[13:21] <mnjiman> lol

[13:21] <mnjiman> then say "HAHA FFFUUU"
[13:21] <mnjiman> lol
[13:21] <Codlike> how are we?
[13:21] <Subhazard> lmfao, yeah if I didn't have to wait for furnaces and I didn't have to go on quests for coal, this castle would be done by now.
[13:21] <Gyap01> What does air lock do xD
[13:22] <AndrewPH> it dies
[13:22] <mnjiman> i say our castle is equal in effort and glory
[13:22] <Subhazard> Yes.
[13:22] <mnjiman> lets not try to messure the size of our penis's
[13:22] <mnjiman> lol
[13:22] <Subhazard> Yours is prettier, mine looks INCREDIBLY ominous :P
[13:22] <Subhazard> Cause it's so.. corporate.
[13:22] <Subhazard> And cold.
[13:22] <Subhazard> lol
[13:23] <Gyap01> Sub make a SS :P
[13:23] <mnjiman> The towers almost hit the ceiling
[13:23] <mnjiman> but
[13:23] <Subhazard> It's like a castle if it were made by CEO Bob Evil
[13:23] <mnjiman> lol
[13:23] <mnjiman> Sub what im going to add is a gaint keep
[13:23] <mnjiman> with a radius
[13:23] <mnjiman> of about
[13:23] <mnjiman> 7-8 blocks
[13:24] <mnjiman> it will be located where my massive iron bridge will be
[13:24] <mnjiman> laced with gold
[13:24] <mnjiman> of course.
[13:24] <Subhazard> Is diamond really that hard to find in Infdev?
[13:24] <mnjiman> lol
[13:24] <Subhazard> Seriously.
[13:24] <mnjiman> from what i heard
[13:24] <mnjiman> yes
[13:24] <Subhazard> I find atleast 3 diamond every time I go on a big dig.
[13:24] <Codlike> I haven't found any
[13:24] <Subhazard> HA! A creeper snuck into my base.
[13:24] <mnjiman> the reason its harder to fine is the lack of caves
[13:25] <Subhazard> He's wandering around lost, he can smell me, but can't see me
[13:25] <Gyap01> WHAT THE SH
[13:25] <mnjiman> lol
[13:25] <Subhazard> lmfao
[13:25] <mnjiman> I had a creeper explode my chest filled with all my diamonds iron and gol
[13:25] <mnjiman> gold
[13:25] <mnjiman> i was sooo pissed
[13:25] <Subhazard> ><
[13:25] <mnjiman> luckly
[13:25] <mnjiman> they just fell out
[13:25] <Subhazard> I would go on a creeper killing spree.
[13:26] <mnjiman> so nothing was destoryed that i foundlol
[13:26] <mnjiman> O speaking of
[13:26] <mnjiman> im also going to make it so ther eis a secrete spot inside the castle
[13:26] <mnjiman> which will triiger the bridge to explode
[13:26] <mnjiman> aka TNT travelling under ground
[13:26] <mnjiman> right to the bridge
[13:26] <mnjiman> lol
[13:26] <Subhazard> I need to figure out an effective way of mining underwater.
[13:27] <mnjiman> O Sub
[13:27] <mnjiman> answer your question from before
[13:27] <mnjiman> I diverted the water into my castle
[13:27] <Malikat> hello notch
[13:27] <mnjiman> a massive undertaking since water is no where near me
[13:27] <mnjiman> lol
[13:28] <mnjiman> it works very nicly, so i have a farm inside my castle!
[13:28] <Malikat> mining underwater is not effective
[13:28] <Malikat> you dig significantly more slowly if you are swimming
[13:28] <mnjiman> O SUB!
[13:28] <mnjiman> We need to build vaults!
[13:28] <Subhazard> Notch, what are your thoughts on the recent Icelandic volcano eruption. We have graphs correlating the success of your game Minecraft, with increasing volcanic activity in Iceland.
[13:28] <Malikat> and a bit more slowly if you are underwater on land
[13:29] <mnjiman> Im going to build a vault with a save
[13:29] <mnjiman> safe*
[13:29] <mnjiman> and you have to enter the right code to enter
[13:29] <mnjiman> and if you dont
[13:29] <mnjiman> DROWNING
[13:29] <mnjiman> but the water will have to come from my moat
[13:29] <mnjiman> :(
[13:29] <Notch> haha
[13:30] <Notch> it's a coincidence, honest
[13:30] <mnjiman> Well there is a Volcano that is 100 times bigger that may erupt as well in the near future,
[13:30] <JTE> Hey Notch, can I be your son?
[13:31] <mnjiman> Aka, it will go offer once MPS is released
[13:31] <mnjiman> off*
[13:31] <Notch> sure
[13:31] <Subhazard> Notch, did you, or did you not have any relation with Goldman Sachs between the periods of June 12th 2006 and Febuary 3rd 2008?

[13:32] <Malikat> oooh snap, i've never soft boiled an egg
[13:32] <Subhazard> We have reason to believe that your success can be attributed to the recent findings regarding Goldman Sachs. Do you care to comment?
[13:32] <Notch> i have no comment
[13:33] <Subhazard> Notch, the public will not accept that as an answer.

[13:47] <Ruska> Ive got caught by that too

[13:48] <MarkofBear> is it ok to praise Notch like a god in this chat?
[13:48] <AndrewPH> MarkofBear, what
[13:48] <Ruska> I bought a second card instead
[13:48] <AndrewPH> ofc
[13:48] <Wolfram> I'm still not sure I see the point of multiple monitors
[13:48] * MarkofBear praises
[13:48] <Roze> Wolfram, more the merrier.
[13:48] <AndrewPH> Wolfram, now you can watch porn on TEW screens
[13:48] <Wolfram> I've never been in a situation where more screen would be a huge improvement
[13:49] <MarkofBear> it looks cool at least
[13:49] <LG_Legacy> Wolfram : What say if someone is MSN'ing you and you're playing a fullscreen game thats unavail for windowed mode, or you don't want to alt tab? (Ex: Prototype.)
[13:49] * MarkofBear is now known as BearClaw89
[13:49] <Wolfram> I don't find that alt-tabbing is a huge problem
[13:49] <Wolfram> In fact, if I have the money for multiple monitors
[13:49] <LG_Legacy> On slow computers? Maybe
[13:49] <Wolfram> My machine ought to be powerful enough to tab painlessly
[13:50] <LG_Legacy> Well..
[13:50] <Roze> But, do you see Legacy's point?
[13:50] <BearClaw89> wolfram if you need to monitor a lot of stuff
[13:50] <LG_Legacy> What if you got too many windows open? checking on the server while you got a big window open?
[13:50] <AndrewPH> Wolfram, alt tabbing performance isn't based directly on computational strength
[13:50] <Wolfram> I see his intended point, but I don't necessarily agree with it
[13:50] <AndrewPH> source engine for example can take quite a bit of time to alt tab back in
[13:51] <LG_Legacy> What if X is too big but Y is too small and you can't tab or look at it due to it being Z?
[13:51] <Roze> Oh a more professional reason:
[13:51] <LG_Legacy> You can kind of see it
[13:51] <Roze> Reading a document/source of info, whilst writing something up.
[13:51] <Ruska> I'm still not sure i see the point in high resolution monitors, I've never been in a situation where 800x600 wasn't enough
[13:51] <Wolfram> I've heard that example before, Roze
[13:51] <LG_Legacy> Ruska
[13:51] <Speljohan_> lolwat Ruska
[13:51] <Wolfram> I can see where it becomes a bit of a luxury option
[13:51] <AndrewPH> LG_Legacy, He's saying what wolfram is saying

[13:51] <AndrewPH> Same basic principal
[13:51] <AndrewPH> it makes it easier
[13:52] <AndrewPH> but it's not needed
[13:52] <LG_Legacy> Sometimes a larger monitor doesn't work well enough. Ruska Ex: I added like this 1900x1600 or whatever the hell it was, and it didn't show everything.
[13:52] <LG_Legacy> Er
[13:52] <LG_Legacy> Res
[13:52] <Gyap01> I can't go on any minecraft servers
[13:52] <LG_Legacy> Gyap01 ?
[13:52] <AndrewPH> Gyap01, mmk
[13:52] <AndrewPH> maybe turn on the porn and sit back
[13:52] <LG_Legacy> LEt's take a random example
[13:52] * LG_Legacy takes a random pic
[13:52] <Wolfram> Just seems to me that if I've never had a critical need for something
[13:53] <Wolfram> Then it doesn't make a ton of sense to pay for it
[13:53] <Wolfram> But again, that's just me
[13:53] <AndrewPH> Wolfram, it's because it's nice
[13:53] <Roze> Wolf, why do you watch TV? -If you do.
[13:53] <AndrewPH> and it makes everything easier

[13:53] <Gyap01> I get an error

[13:54] <Gyap01> AFK
[13:54] <Roze> Why do you play Video Games?
[13:54] <Wirtualnosc> Because they're good.
[13:54] <Roze> For the leisure!
[13:54] <Wolfram> I would say the challenge
[13:54] <Roze> You don't need them to survive, they're wants.
[13:54] <Wolfram> But of course we could reduce the motivation for practically everything to leisure
[13:54] <LG_Legacy> Roze Metal Gear Solid was a NEED for me
[13:55] <Wolfram> But we're talking about having something in a very functional form
[13:55] <Wolfram> And then splurging for something not nearly as important
[13:55] <Wolfram> Just as a kind of by-the-way
[13:55] <Roze> I knew, there was going to be a smart remark about that..
[13:55] <BearClaw89> probably
[13:55] <Wolfram> I'll tell you one thing I saw that was pretty cool
[13:55] <Roze> There's no main global reason, for having multiple desktops.

[14:06] <Notch> you don't want them anymore, MastCrasher?

[14:07] <MastCrasher> I think a better man should raise them
[14:07] <Notch> Codlike: Well, I'm not sure.. I played around with it a while back, but I need to rewrite some of my texture atlasing code
[14:07] <Notch> it's not at all impossible
[14:08] <Superwafflez> Why not use external AA through gpu control panels, if you want it so much.

[14:09] <LG_Legacy> Let me fetch it
[14:09] <MastCrasher> oh, dont tell me someone's already done it! D:
[14:09] <Codlike> The only problem about using external AA through your card panels is that you get Red lines everywhere
[14:09] <Codlike> and with Mipmapping it causes purple water
[14:10] <Merciless> how...odd
[14:10] <Codlike> indeed
[14:10] <Notch> yeah, it's because of the thight atlasing

[14:22] <Merciless> so good live
[14:23] <Codlike> Another couple requests chunk: FOV settings, Ram usage slider in Options, No-critter difficulty, silent Sheep and Pig mode and...
[14:23] <Codlike> I think that's all
[14:23] <Codlike> for now
[14:23] <MastCrasher> Dont forget about HDR!
[14:23] <Notch> why do you want to change the ram?
[14:24] <Codlike> someone has found they had improved performance
[14:24] <Codlike> since they have so much ram
[14:24] <Notch> it has no impact on performance for me
[14:24] <LG_Legacy> Notch I had to change my ram for /Indev/ to get Isometric screenshots to work, but even then it came out funny :<
[14:24] <Codlike> well, you have a beast of a computer
[14:24] <Codlike> dont you?
[14:24] <Notch> the game doesn't allocate more ram than it does..
[14:25] <Notch> the only way it could affect performance at all is if it affects the GC in java
[14:25] <Notch> I mean, it if affects performance for some people, it obviously does SOMETHING. :D
[14:25] <Codlike> mhm
[14:26] <Superwafflez> Just allow for more RAM to be used then? lol...
[14:26] <chibifs> > http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I < Amazing
[14:27] <Notch> it's not that easy from inside an applet
[14:27] <Notch> the ram limit gets set by the applet container
[14:27] <MastCrasher> just dont understand how I can be playing this game for 2-3 months already
[14:27] <Superwafflez> Oh well that complicates things.
[14:27] <MastCrasher> YOu're just hitting blocks
[14:27] <Notch> and if I set it too high, some containers will just default it to 64mb, which won't even run the game
[14:27] <Merciless> 'so find out what the max for the container is i guess :)
[14:27] <Notch> how?
[14:28] <Superwafflez> External clients seem more and more useful in this regard...
[14:28] <Notch> aye
[14:28] <Notch> the downloadable version probably won't have this problem
[14:28] <Superwafflez> I guess having it browser embeddable is in your main interests though.
[14:29] <Notch> it's nice during alpha
[14:29] <Notch> I get all sorts of stats for free with just http logging
[14:29] <Superwafflez> :O
[14:29] <Notch> and it's an easy way to share the game (links to levels, links to servers) quickly
[14:30] <Superwafflez> Yah
[14:30] <Speljohan_> aaaaaaahhh i need a mouse
[14:30] <Speljohan_> this is wtfannoying
[14:30] <Superwafflez> When it goes fully paid I guess having a demo version embedded somewhere would be useful, then having the fully featured client as a separate downloadable package...
[14:30] <Superwafflez> if that makes sense
[14:31] <JabJabJab> Hey look its he notch
[14:31] <AndrewPH> norly
[14:31] <JabJabJab> Hmm I want to talk to u notch but I think I'd rather talk to you about this in email

[14:32] <MastCrasher> @Notch, would I have to generate a new world when you implement water "physics"
[14:33] <AndrewPH> bottom right
[14:33] <Superwafflez> Wouldn't old water just be treated as static?
[14:33] <JabJabJab> thx. Hey Notch, good work on infdev, the generating maps are magnificent. I didnt see much good of infdev till recent plays

[15:57] <BearClaw89> that and the lemming like pigs
[15:57] <dretch> haha, you know i was trying to develop some way to keep pigs out of my fort
[15:57] <BearClaw89> i usually just mine a giant trench to make them jump out of cliffs
[15:57] <dretch> but my fort is so large, i assume they spawn based on proximity, so they always spawn somewhere inside
[15:58] <BearClaw89> tried torches dretch?

[16:11] <dretch> what do you fellas think about how the tech tree can be expanded, bronze/iron/tin/copper/steel/etc?
[16:12] <Emperor> I remember reading notch mention he didnt want RPG stats
[16:12] <Emperor> was a long time ago though and I do indeed have a bad memory
[16:13] * revenant (dlukes@66.37.59.138.nauticom.net) has joined #minecraft
[16:13] <dretch> no, not stats/levels/skills and stuff, i mean more ore
[16:13] <Emperor> ohh
[16:13] <dretch> mining copper and tin first since they're the most malleable save gold, then smelting them into bronze
[16:13] <Emperor> yes, light "high quality" "regular"
[16:13] <Emperor> that would be cool
[16:14] <dretch> i don't mean quality either lol
[16:14] <Emperor> dammit
[16:14] <Emperor> lol
[16:14] <dretch> if instead of going from wooden tree to wooden pick
[16:14] <dretch> to stone pick to iron pick to diamond
[16:14] <dretch> it would be like, a soft wood, to a medium wood, to a very hard wood like oak?
[16:14] <dretch> then copper and tin, then smelted to bronze
[16:14] <dretch> then iron, any other minerals?
[16:15] <dretch> so you'd have more of a sensible progression and a more developed tech tree. i dunno, was just brainstorming.
[16:15] <Rithiur> If the only difference between the materials is durability, then adding lots of different materials isn't really that useful.
[16:15] <Emperor> i would like to atleast see one more type of wood, but mostly just want different colored planks for decoration, like one would be a light wood one would be darker
[16:16] <dretch> well yeah, i figured a warm wood for something soft, lighter for medium, and dark for really hard
[16:16] <Emperor> also a tree with darker folliage just for the visual aspect
[16:16] <dretch> theres a whole bunch of options for foliage, bushes that grow on the grass, tons of different leaves and leaf shades
[16:16] * nibbsy (nibbsy@178.205.dsl.mel.iprimus.net.au) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[16:16] <Emperor> evergreen trees are a must IMO when seasons come out, so some trees would have no foliage and the evergreeens would still be there, dark and....coneshaped
[16:17] <dretch> bushes would probably be easy to implement too, just another block that grows on grass and in clumps
[16:17] <dretch> maybe berry bushes and stuff, for making food and dyes for cloth?
[16:17] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[16:17] <Emperor> yea thats very likely as notch mentioned dyes for cloth
[16:17] <dretch> that'd be cool, and a new tool for foraging
[16:17] * Daimao (daimao.fp@dhcp-095-096-197-220.chello.nl) has joined #minecraft
[16:17] <dretch> or just a lack of a tool.. maybe gloves?
[16:17] * Merciless (Merciless@115-64-20-105.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[16:18] <dretch> you know when you bring up berries and foraging, theres a whole chunk of options you can use them for
[16:18] <Emperor> maybe an equippable berry picking basket :3
[16:18] <dretch> food obviously but you can also use them as some kind of poison, animal repellent, animal lure
[16:18] <pajlada> berry picking would be awesome.
[16:18] <Emperor> poison tipped arrows?
[16:18] <dretch> like picking the right berries and combining them with arrows to make poisoned arrows
[16:18] <Emperor> poison arrow mind
[16:18] * arxx picks up a strawberry
[16:18] <dretch> or combining them with arrows to make arrows that can burn for a long period of time, so you'd have incendiary arrows
[16:18] <Emperor> i just really want flaming arrows
[16:18] * arxx puts it in his mouth
[16:18] <dretch> flamingarrow mind haha
[16:18] * arxx gets 10 hearts
[16:18] <Emperor> dammit flame arrow mind
[16:18] <arxx> yay!
[16:18] <dretch> you know what else you can do with berries though
[16:19] <Emperor> put em in your butt?
[16:19] <dretch> aside from dyes ofcourse, you can also implement them as a sort of alchemy
[16:19] <pajlada> throw them at people
[16:19] <arxx> stick em in your pu.. mouth
[16:19] <Daimao> The only thing I want is a torch or 4 to start with.
[16:19] <dretch> to make potions or curatives for wood and such
[16:19] <Daimao> :v
[16:19] <dretch> you know what i'd really like
[16:19] <Merciless> trol lol olo lo loll olo hahahaaaaa
[16:19] <dretch> combining an iron helmet with a torch and 2 pieces of glass
[16:19] <arxx> Daimao , what about a pickaxr
[16:19] <dretch> to make a mining helmet
[16:19] <arxx> pickaxe*
[16:19] <dretch> that lights up the area around you.
[16:19] <dretch> that would be so incredibly useful
[16:19] <Emperor> lol
[16:19] <arxx> Dretch , it would require like.. 1389561235 chunk update.. stuff..
[16:19] <dretch> it'd just be a helmet with a lantern on top lol
[16:19] <Emperor> combine lamp + helmet in crafting
[16:19] <dretch> it would?
[16:20] <dretch> because of constant motion?
[16:20] <arxx> Yup
[16:20] <Emperor> notch said portable torches are possible with new light system
[16:20] <arxx> Oh
[16:20] <arxx> Awesome
[16:20] <Emperor> the last system was the one where it was impossible because hcunk updates
[16:20] <dretch> well regarding lighting anyway, the torches should probably burn down
[16:20] <Emperor> they will
[16:20] <dretch> but maybe making lanterns or some kind of everburning torch?
[16:20] <Emperor> thats is planned
[16:20] <Emperor> and there will be harder to make lamps which dont burn out
[16:20] <dretch> because constantly replacing torches in your own mine or fort would be unbeleivably pain-in-the-butt
[16:20] <dretch> that'd be perfect
[16:20] <arxx> I wish you could pee and poo in minecraft
[16:20] <arxx> and after that eat it
[16:20] <dretch> pricy lamps, which'd be like.. coal, 4 wood planks, 5 glass...
[16:20] <Emperor> i just wish you had hunger/thirst
[16:21] <Daimao> put it in a jar and throw it for minicrits
[16:21] <dretch> speaking of crafting, what about larger crafting tables?
[16:21] <Daimao> ;)
[16:21] <Roadcrosser> meh
[16:21] <dretch> something that requires iron and wood to make a 4x4 or 5x5 grid with more complicated recipes?
[16:21] <arxx> And furniture
[16:21] <Roadcrosser> that has been cond=sidered I think
[16:21] <Emperor> not really larger crafting tables
[16:21] <dretch> or furniture/doors?
[16:21] <arxx> Like.. kitchen blocks and stuff
[16:21] <Emperor> but just more specialized crafting items
[16:21] * Adurah (Adura@bas4-toronto21-1176312352.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Quit: Quit)
[16:21] <arxx> Doors , that could be smashable by zombies
[16:21] <Emperor> like a forge
[16:21] <Roadcrosser> :/
[16:21] <dretch> haha doors that zombies would hit for 10-20 seconds to break down
[16:21] <dretch> that'd be cool.
[16:21] <dretch> also on forges, what about forges that have to built near magma
[16:21] <arxx> Oh and windows
[16:22] <Roadcrosser> Notch add locks. Now.
[16:22] <dretch> to smelt high temperature materials?>
[16:22] <arxx> Skeles shoot the glass blocks
[16:22] <arxx> They break
[16:22] <arxx> And catch an eat you D:
[16:22] <arxx> GAAH!
[16:22] <Emperor> forges MAKE magma
[16:22] <Emperor> thats what they do.
[16:22] * arxx runs away
[16:22] <Merciless> i just watched carameldancing and enjoyed it
[16:22] <Merciless> am i gay?
[16:22] <dretch> no, they burn coal, probably burn 300-500f
[16:22] <Daimao> yes
[16:22] <Merciless> ...fuck
[16:22] <dretch> magma on the other hand is on the order of thousands of degrees
[16:22] <Emperor> what? forges are used to shape steal by blacksmiths
[16:22] <dretch> if you had to smelt something like steel?
[16:22] <Merciless> what can i do to reinstate my straightness
[16:22] <dretch> yeah, but those aren't lava-based
[16:23] <Emperor> b-b-b-but
[16:23] <dretch> they burn high temperature fuel sure, but they aren't situated on top of lava deposits lol
[16:23] <arxx> Anyways , I'm off to barrel roll
[16:23] <Emperor> they melt steel ;_;
[16:23] <dretch> but it'd be very cool if you had to dig deep into the earth to build a magma forge
[16:23] * arxx does the barrel roll
[16:23] <Daimao> Shave your chest-hair in the shape of Australia and grow a big stache.
[16:23] <dretch> so you could smelt steel and other high temp recipes
[16:23] <dretch> steel would be right between iron and diamond, replacing what diamond is now
[16:23] <Emperor> australia? brb looking at flat-chest porn
[16:23] <dretch> and then diamond would be like, unbreakable, same speed as steel
[16:23] <Ruska> i just want a god damn ham sandwich
[16:23] <dretch> and can't mine diamond ore
[16:23] <Daimao> But that's banned in Australia.
[16:23] <dretch> that'd be awesome.
[16:24] <Daimao> In fact everything is banned in Australia.
[16:24] <Emperor> diamond wont be unbreakable but the durability will be getting a huge boost
[16:24] <Daimao> Also it'd be cool if there were more fluids or something.
[16:24] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[16:24] <Daimao> Like oil or something.
[16:24] <Emperor> kill whales for oil
[16:24] <Daimao> yes
[16:24] <Daimao> i agre
[16:24] <Emperor> and whale fat for candle wax
[16:24] <Emperor> and bubble gum
[16:24] <Daimao> You are a genious.

[16:28] <dretch> you know, if whales and other sea life were implemented
[16:28] <dretch> some kind of diving gear would also be very important since you can't breathe long
[16:28] <dretch> whaddya think, how would you make an oxygen tank in minecraft?
[16:28] * revenant (dlukes@66.37.59.138.nauticom.net) has joined #minecraft
[16:28] <Emperor> hmmm
[16:28] <dretch> or maybe you could, OH MAN! what if there was a berry you could pick from a shrub that converted carbon dioxide into oxygen
[16:28] <BearClaw89> god idea
[16:28] <dretch> you could make a breathing mask out of berries and iron and glass!
[16:28] <dretch> THATD BE AWESOME!
[16:29] <dretch> a really rare plant too
[16:29] <Emperor> :|
[16:29] <godhand1942> lol miracle berry
[16:29] <Daimao> :l
[16:29] <Emperor> no
[16:29] <dretch> well, it'd be poisonous
[16:29] <Daimao> Wear a sponge or something.
[16:29] <dretch> so you'd have to handle it with gloves
[16:29] <Emperor> notch said scuba gear has to be super hard to make
[16:29] <Emperor> so im thinking this
[16:29] <dretch> so you'd have to craft the gloves to make scuba gear
[16:29] <Daimao> All the water will magically vanish around you.
[16:29] <Emperor> a 3x3 square with empty block in middle (air) of solid steel blocks
[16:29] <Emperor> for air tank
[16:30] <Emperor> so it would cost a lot of iron/steel ore
[16:30] <dretch> i agree, maybe with a berry instead of open air
[16:30] <Emperor> haha
[16:30] <dretch> and instead of being able to breathe underwater forever
[16:30] <Emperor> you and your berries
[16:30] <Daimao> Also have you guys ever found diamonds in infdev? I've had this game for a month or so but I haven't been able to find any.
[16:30] <dretch> it'd just triple or quadruple your air
[16:30] <dretch> so you'd refill when you get up to the surface
[16:30] <dretch> no man, i don't think they're implemented
[16:30] <Emperor> no diamons in infdev
[16:30] <Daimao> Ah.
[16:30] <dretch> going through 17 thousand stone blocks with iron sucks

[16:31] * Gyap01 (johngabs_2@124.104.122.48) has joined #minecraft
[16:31] <dretch> i'd rather dynamite but even with infdev's massive spawnrate, its faster to just mine with iron picks
[16:31] <Emperor> yea, i was hoping today wed be updated with caves and ores, the last thing i care about in infdev but its just a optimization for people with rappy computers ;_;
[16:31] <dretch> speaking of dynamite, its a little wierd the way it is today
[16:31] <dretch> it takes 5 gunpowder and 4 sand just to make a single batch of dynamite
[16:31] * Subhazard (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[16:31] <dretch> maybe make creepers drop more dynamite, or have it cost less to make dynamite?
[16:31] <dretch> or make it craft in groups of 4 or so? so its a viable way to mine?
[16:32] <Daimao> Make creepers faster and buff their explosive radius.
[16:32] <dretch> i mean, crazy and dangerous but viable
[16:32] <Daimao> 10 miles or so would be good.
[16:32] <Emperor> nah dynamite is only good for blasting through sand/dirt
[16:32] <dretch> hahaha are you nuts
[16:32] <dretch> yeah i noticed
[16:32] <dretch> it does a lot more in soft materials
[16:32] <Daimao> Creepers are incredible.
[16:32] <dretch> but you can just
[16:32] <Emperor> and maybe us dynamite for future crafting, like explosive arrows?!
[16:32] <Emperor> for mega-creature killing
[16:32] <dretch> use a shovel and tear through sand and dirt in no time
[16:32] <Daimao> What.
[16:32] <Daimao> How would that work?
[16:32] <dretch> haha gunpowder, stick, feather
[16:32] <dretch> x4 explosive arrows
[16:32] <Daimao> Tape a block of tnt to an arrow?
[16:32] <dretch> remove knockback from all weapons
[16:32] <dretch> and make the explosive ones AOE and knockback
[16:32] <Emperor> would be awesome
[16:32] <whatdoesth> It worked for Rambo...
[16:32] <dretch> that'd be interesting
[16:33] <Emperor> lolrambo
[16:33] <Daimao> hah
[16:33] <dretch> you know speaking of combat
[16:33] <Emperor> ADRIAN
[16:33] <Daimao> Also wales should work like this:
[16:33] <Daimao> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2372797/verassing.mp4
[16:33] <dretch> i was thinking of alternative ways to deal with knockback and creatures
[16:33] <dretch> what if swords were knockback-removed
[16:33] <dretch> and maces were implemented with knockback
[16:33] <dretch> 2 handed, slow to swing, maybe a shield equipable with swords for more armor?
[16:34] <dretch> so you could like, punt creepers with a big iron sledgehammer, or bust down stuff you can't mine/chop

[16:35] <dretch> like, really low damage, but you could throw them at sheep and pigs
[16:35] <dretch> and they'd run away lol
[16:35] <Roadcrosser> lol
[16:35] <Daimao> Any word on caves?
[16:35] <Roadcrosser> and what about crafting a catapult for a longer range?
[16:35] <Emperor> needs a 4x4 craft table so we could use 3 sticks with rock/iron on top for spears, 4 sticks for sharpened spear
[16:35] <dretch> and maybe get a slingshot from rubber and then they'd do damage? like a weak bow and arrow with slower refire?
[16:35] <Emperor> sharpened stick*
[16:36] <dretch> catapult, LOL!

[16:36] <Roadcrosser> i meant slingshot
[16:36] <dretch> "LOAD THE CATAPULT!"
[16:36] <Roadcrosser> sorry
[16:36] <Emperor> i would never stop playing this game
[16:36] <Emperor> seiging other castles
[16:36] <dretch> "FIRE THE SHEEP-A-PULT!"
[16:36] <Emperor> would be unreal
[16:36] <dretch> "BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH"
[16:36] <Roadcrosser> lol
[16:36] <dretch> dear god i'd never stop playing it
[16:36] <Emperor> also i want trains!
[16:36] <dretch> trains are silly
[16:36] <Roadcrosser> FIRE THE COW-A-PULT!
[16:36] <Emperor> trains would be so awesome
[16:37] <dretch> but you know what would actually be viable, transportation-wise?
[16:37] <Roadcrosser> and the cow jumped over the moon
[16:37] <dretch> what about horses?
[16:37] <Roadcrosser> broomsticks?
[16:37] <Daimao> A rideable Creeper.
[16:37] <dretch> they'd graze on grass, 10 seconds to clear a segment of grass
[16:37] <dretch> and you'd mount them and they'd wander around
[16:37] <dretch> and if you had like, carrots from farming, and a stick, and string
[16:37] <dretch> you could make a carrot on a stick
[16:37] <joggel> sali z??m?? na was mached ihr wieder f??r schiissdreck
[16:37] <dretch> and ride the horse where you wanted to go :D
[16:37] <Daimao> Oh man oh god.
[16:37] <dretch> that'd be cool
[16:37] <dretch> set your height to 3 blocks instead of 2 on the horse
[16:37] <Roadcrosser> creepers have a self destruct button
[16:37] <BearClaw89> did i hear carrt on a stick?
[16:37] <joggel> t??end ihr wieder de notsch plaage
[16:37] <dretch> runs twice as fast, jumps twice as far
[16:37] <dretch> that'd be the best early transportation
[16:37] <dretch> especially if the horse was slow to turn
[16:38] <Roadcrosser> lol
[16:38] <Roadcrosser> think about it
[16:38] <Roadcrosser> 50 peeps in a server all riding horses
[16:38] <Daimao> I liked the one infection block idea on the forums.
[16:38] <dretch> afk a minute, but think about horses and other critters
[16:38] <Daimao> It spawned Creepers every now and then and expanded rapidly.
[16:38] <Daimao> Would be horribly unbalanced though. :v

[18:31] <Dys-sleep> Actaully Quatroking Gizmodo bought it for 5000$
[18:31] <Roadcrosser> all the parts are apple
[18:31] <Dys-sleep> and apple is demanding it back :/

[18:34] <Roadcrosser> field testing
[18:34] <Roadcrosser> why else
[18:34] <Roadcrosser> and how else could there be a 3GS casing with cuts that no human could do?
[18:35] <bildramer> what
[18:35] <Roadcrosser> it was made specificly for that prototype
[18:35] <bildramer> lol field testing
[18:35] <Roadcrosser> wut
[18:35] <bildramer> I don't even need to know more to understand it's a fake

[20:18] <Vicrry> infdev doesn't do that
[20:19] <KodaichiZerp> Nawtch doesn't do that^
[20:20] <Naio> so.. been a while since i read that post
[20:20] <Naio> it's finite water, but from edge of map, assuming water, there would be infinite?
[20:20] <KodaichiZerp> right
[20:20] <Naio> its finite in the terms of, if you have 1 block of water in a cave, its not going to infinitely multiply if it has space below it

[20:22] <KodaichiZerp> lol
[20:22] <Naio> its a deep scratch, guys!
[20:22] <zeroZshadow> thats what i would do
[20:23] <KodaichiZerp> desk optimization, currently at 85%. I can still see the faded marks, gonna need to usea lot more varnish.
[20:23] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[20:23] <Marach> ^

[20:24] <Ten_Tacles> Then you have a strange life.
[20:24] <dretch> it'd be hard not to play it like crazy
[20:24] <Ten_Tacles> MP infdev will never exist
[20:24] <dretch> makin huge underground bases with buddies
[20:24] <Naio> MP survival, you know what i mean
[20:24] <zeroZshadow> Notch, so whats on the optimizing list today ?
[20:24] <dretch> mp infdev will definitly exist
[20:24] <Marach> i think im tired
[20:25] <Vicrry> Does grass stop growing along a one block wide beam at some point?
[20:25] <Marach> when i see "dretch" just above of "Naio", i merge them and think "Notch" finally said something
[20:25] <Vicrry> My seawall is still dirt after a few days
[20:25] <Naio> :-p
[20:25] <zeroZshadow> or maby switching rendering to a bi-directional path tracer using the metropolis light transport method ?
[20:25] <Marach> this keeps happening.
[20:25] <Marach> can you please stop talking at the same time? :/

[20:26] * Naio is now known as Naioooooooo
[20:26] <Ausfriend> whenever dretch speaks, his name is coloured the same as Notch's colour always
[20:26] <zeroZshadow> Marach, impossible
[20:26] <Ausfriend> so yeah
[20:26] <Naioooooooo> that better?
[20:26] <dretch> wooooooo
[20:26] <Marach> zeroZshadow: not you
[20:26] <zeroZshadow> xD
[20:26] <KodaichiZerp> my names have no colors!
[20:26] <Marach> mine do
[20:26] <KodaichiZerp> except mine is grey, the rest are blue
[20:26] <Ruska> I wonder what Notch's house looks like
[20:26] <KodaichiZerp> and if someone calls me,there's an orange dot
[20:26] <zeroZshadow> lets do a geek check, who likes this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm6hz2-gxZ0 ?
[20:26] <Lukisod> I see black
[20:26] <Ruska> i bet its all cubey
[20:27] <KodaichiZerp> Ruska: someone found Nawtch's house via sattelite
[20:27] <Naioooooooo> thats old school lighting
[20:27] <Ruska> i mean inside
[20:27] <Lukisod> mediocre lighting demonstration?
[20:27] <KodaichiZerp> they basically know where he lives
[20:27] <Naioooooooo> i would not want to be notch
[20:27] <zeroZshadow> Naioooooooo, actualy.. its really new
[20:27] <Naioooooooo> 15k crazy people after him
[20:27] <dretch> hahaha
[20:28] <Ten_Tacles> ^^
[20:28] <Naioooooooo> zero, i didnt see anything breathtaking/new in the video
[20:28] <Ten_Tacles> That
[20:28] <Vicrry> Looks like a lighting demo from 5 years ago
[20:28] <Vicrry> Even if it new
[20:28] <KodaichiZerp> eh, idk
[20:28] <KodaichiZerp> also
[20:28] <KodaichiZerp> 15k purchases under him >:)
[20:28] <zeroZshadow> Vicrry, if you have something similar of 5 years ago, i dare you to show it to me :P
[20:28] <Naioooooooo> not to count the non-purchasers
[20:28] <dretch> so how do you guys feel about magic in minecraft?
[20:29] <Naioooooooo> i'm for it
[20:29] <Ruska> thats 225000 dollars! now if you count all the taxes and fee, he can almost buy dinner
[20:29] <Naioooooooo> also for PvP
[20:29] <Vicrry> That was 5yr ago, you think it still exsists? :P
[20:29] <Marach> zeroZshadow: meh? im so way behind today's graphics than i can only imagine what things are already possible in realtime. therefore, nothing can surprise me
[20:29] <Naioooooooo> if there is no PvP, there is no way to stop the griefers!
[20:30] <dretch> the issue of griefing can be solved pretty much instantly
[20:30] <KodaichiZerp> lol someone modded Zelda in brawl to have a grafted lip and cat ears http://kc-mm.com/?p=3335
[20:30] <dretch> make MP servers private and public
[20:30] <Naioooooooo> yeah
[20:30] <dretch> noone would bother wasting time on public due to griefers, so the entire game becomes a sort of friend-invite game
[20:30] <Naioooooooo> which is not fun
[20:30] <dretch> besides i would only want to play with my friends anyway, just make password-able servers and griefing goes away
[20:30] <KodaichiZerp> why this is supposed to be attractive, I don't know
[20:30] <Naioooooooo> yeah thats not hard
[20:30] <dretch> well, in public, theres a lot of ways to avoid griefers
[20:30] <Naioooooooo> but i want to play on a public server
[20:30] <Naioooooooo> i dont want it to be friend-only
[20:31] <Ruska> capture a herd of creeper and skeleton
[20:31] <dretch> you could have some kind of public-only anti-griefer flag
[20:31] <Ruska> release onto griefer
[20:31] <dretch> something that prevents blocks from being destroyed in an area
[20:31] <zeroZshadow> Marach, hehe
[20:31] <Naioooooooo> they need to be able to defend your base
[20:31] <Marach> :/
[20:31] <Marach> shouldn't that be sad
[20:31] <Naioooooooo> guards, etc etc etc
[20:31] <zeroZshadow> actualy this is the only realtime path tracer with this quality at this time
[20:31] <dretch> i'd be incredibly happy with some kinda automatic defense turret
[20:31] <dretch> so if anyone starts picking on your blocks
[20:31] <dretch> it'll just kill em haha
[20:31] <Naioooooooo> though
[20:32] <Naioooooooo> it should be possible to get past
[20:32] <Naioooooooo> you should be able to have your fort destroyed if you cannot protect it well enough
[20:32] <Marach> dretch: :3
[20:32] <Naioooooooo> but, you should have the ability to protect it
[20:32] <Lukisod> make blocks take longer to destory
[20:32] <Naioooooooo> i could just imagine raids on other forts/towns, it would be so amazing
[20:32] <Naioooooooo> it would be like high-speed wurm
[20:32] * Sickofguessing (Sickofgues@5ad2912a.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
[20:33] <Lukisod> takes all the fun out of griefing if it takes you 20seconds to destory one block
[20:33] * Marach has never played wurm and never will
[20:33] <dretch> i'd imagine increasing block destruction time wouldn't make much of a difference
[20:33] <whatdoesth> It would be amazing, except.. <dretch> noone would bother wasting time on public due to griefers, so the entire game becomes a sort of friend-invite game
[20:33] <Marach> bah, java time
[20:33] <Naioooooooo> wurm is a great game, tons of potential
[20:33] <dretch> minecraft is better and has more potential
[20:33] <Naioooooooo> agreed
[20:33] <Naioooooooo> also, notch is behind it
[20:33] <Marach> Naioooooooo: you're a first person i heard saying something good about wurm
[20:33] <KodaichiZerp> exceot
[20:33] <Naioooooooo> just how notch was behind everything that was great behind wurm
[20:34] <Naioooooooo> wurm is going downhill
[20:34] <Naioooooooo> minecraft is going uphill
[20:34] <Marach> i love the front page.
[20:34] <Naioooooooo> of?
[20:34] <Ten_Tacles> I played Wurm for a day.
[20:34] <Marach> "are you emo? to you want to be in emoland?"
[20:34] <Ten_Tacles> It was nice, but the community sucked.
[20:34] <Ruska> you just need to be imaginative to attack a fort in minecraft
[20:34] <Ruska> house built of wood?
[20:34] <Naioooooooo> ten, you gotta get out of the starter server
[20:34] <Ruska> flint and steel
[20:34] <Ten_Tacles> <.<
[20:34] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[20:34] <dretch> who would ever build a house out of wood
[20:34] * KodaichiZerp (silentj43@mc-194-102.IPReg.mcmaster.ca) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:34] <Naioooooooo> the starter server is so ridiculously horrible
[20:35] <Ruska> fort out of stone? dynamite
[20:35] <Ruska> fort out of gold? well fuck you
[20:35] <dretch> i don't think the multi will work for a while outside of private servers
[20:35] <dretch> there are too many options to destroy ones creations
[20:35] * Jat-afk (Jat@do193-110.resnet.stonybrook.edu) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.3/20100401080539])
[20:35] <dretch> and too many players that would enjoy doing something like that
[20:35] <dretch> and really no way to stop them, yet.
[20:35] <Naioooooooo> or
[20:36] <Naioooooooo> you need to be good at hiding yourself
[20:36] <dretch> i'd be more concerned about the games tech tree, new blocks, new crafting recipes
[20:36] <whatdoesth> But in survival mode, there really should be risk of your stuff being destroyed
[20:36] <dretch> and the possible implementation of some magic system
[20:36] <Naioooooooo> underground/underwater forts would be near impossible to find on the inf maps
[20:36] <dretch> because pvp is pretty much just a circlejerk as of current
[20:36] <Marach> dretch: minecraft will have less griefers once it becomes paidonly
[20:36] <dretch> true
[20:36] <MPeti> exactly, marach.
[20:36] <Lukisod> maybe
[20:36] <dretch> that will reduce a LOT of the griefing
[20:36] <dretch> since most of the griefers can't even use paypal
[20:36] <MPeti> ye
[20:36] <Marach> by less i meant much less
[20:36] <Naioooooooo> if MP survival is paid only (it should be) there will be a lot less griefing
[20:36] <whatdoesth> In Creative, there should be zero risk of something being destroyed, but in Survival, I don't see why it shouldn't be fair game.
[20:37] <Marach> Naioooooooo: WHOLE multiplayer.
[20:37] <Naioooooooo> or, he should have paid and unpaid MP survival servers
[20:37] <MPeti> yeah, but still
[20:37] <Ruska> mp survival should have pvp
[20:37] <Ruska> thats the whole point!
[20:37] <Naioooooooo> definitely
[20:37] <Naioooooooo> absollutely
[20:37] <Ten_Tacles> MP will be prem only.
[20:37] <MPeti> it's nice to build a big fort with hardness
[20:37] <Ten_Tacles> No not prems.
[20:37] <MPeti> and it's not nice to see it messed
[20:37] <dretch> i dont think that is the point at all
[20:37] <Naioooooooo> well he said that he's putting in the solid grey block that takes lots of resources
[20:37] <dretch> i'd like to see a huge pve server with massive hostile raids at night
[20:37] <whatdoesth> Then defend it, or do it in single player or creative.
[20:37] <Naioooooooo> maybe that will take a while to destroy
[20:37] <MPeti> well, that's the thing
[20:37] <dretch> trying to defend your carefully constructed base with ingenious traps
[20:38] <dretch> enemies that can destroy blocks that aren't just creepers
[20:38] <MPeti> P v P or P v E
[20:38] <MPeti> there'll be both
[20:38] <dretch> i'd be surprised if a super hard mode was made for pve
[20:38] <dretch> with just hordes of enemies swarming at night
[20:38] <dretch> traps, magic circles everywhere
[20:38] <MPeti> well, I wouldn't
[20:38] <Naioooooooo> well hasnt he also planned the fort/survival modes?
[20:38] <dretch> players firing hundreds of arrows from the walls
[20:38] <Dysgalt> what the shit
[20:38] <Naioooooooo> aka build a fort, and zombies attack you?
[20:38] <MPeti> Notch wants to make the game hard, remember
[20:38] <dretch> that'd be awesome
[20:38] <Dysgalt> creative loaded with no blocks
[20:38] <whatdoesth> I mean really, unless the monsters get huge buffs, "PvE" is little more than "Creative II"
[20:38] <dretch> making the game hard though, that'd require a rebuild of the combat system
[20:38] <MPeti> yeah
[20:38] <dretch> with the current knockback thing
[20:39] <dretch> its just timing and .. kinda silly
[20:39] <MPeti> yea... more weapons needed and different control
[20:39] <dretch> i think it should be more of a slugfest, with knockback and the locations being a secondary priority
[20:39] <dretch> the bow should be pulled and fired, do more damage, and be much slower to fire too
[20:39] <dretch> also if critters are implemented, especially birds and chickens etc, feathers should come from them
[20:39] <MPeti> well, surely it'll have a reload time
[20:39] <Marach> dretch: bow was a quick hack
[20:39] <dretch> yeah i know
[20:39] <MPeti> if it won't, there'll be deathray-ers
[20:39] <dretch> i mean regarding combat and weapon balance
[20:39] <Marach> as is all item spawning
[20:40] <Marach> everything's just a placeholder atm
[20:40] <dretch> i'd also love to see some kind of boss creature
[20:40] <MPeti> yeah
[20:40] * Naioooooooo (Mibbit@sp-internet-ext-ply.uhc.com) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[20:40] <dretch> or some larger monsters, maybe 3x3x3
[20:40] <Marach> balancing will come last.
[20:40] <dretch> like giant crocodiles etc.
[20:40] <MPeti> there'll be a load of new enemies... I hope boss stuff too
[20:40] <dretch> yeah i know, just thinkin out loud
[20:41] <MPeti> By the way, what do you think about monsters that destroy blocks? It's defiantly needed, but how should it work?
[20:41] * TerraSleet (SikGamer@5ac85129.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
[20:41] <TerraSleet> Ahoy
[20:41] <dretch> oh definitly needed
[20:41] <dretch> you ever play gears of war?
[20:41] <Quatroking> everyone who hates the forum dragons, raise your hand
[20:41] * Quatroking raises his hand
[20:41] <dretch> there are these rockworms that are basically made out of stone
[20:41] <TerraSleet> lol forum dragons
[20:41] <dretch> they move really slow and eat these berries underground
[20:41] <MPeti> quatroking: Me to :/
[20:41] <dretch> but they tunnel through the ground itself
[20:41] <MPeti> too *
[20:41] <dretch> i think it'd be awesome if you were mining and you just came right in the path of a rockworm
[20:41] <dretch> not meat eater so he'd just go around you, but it'd be crazy cool to say the least
[20:41] <MPeti> lol
[20:41] <whatdoesth> There are lots of ways to do this, and I think ALL of them should be used
[20:41] <Quatroking> anyone wanna voiceact a flash of mine
[20:41] <dretch> screen shakin, dust everywhere, pebbles flyin all over
[20:42] <dretch> that'd be SO COOL, and thats just one enemy
[20:42] <dretch> and then if you killed em, maybe they'd drop a special rock you could only get from rockworms
[20:42] <MPeti> yeah, it's possible
[20:42] <dretch> that could be used for some kinda cool weapon or armor etc.
[20:42] <whatdoesth> Things like those worms, ghosts and such that can phase through walls, enemies that slowly chip through and destroy the blocks
[20:42] <MPeti> lol, good idea
[20:42] <dretch> that. would be awesome.
[20:42] <dretch> so new critters, brainstorming?
[20:43] <MPeti> but what about enemies raiding your base? How should that work? It's no good if you go away and come back to see a messed base??
[20:43] <whatdoesth> Probably a little harder to implement, would need a slightly more advanced bit of pathfinding for that
[20:43] <dretch> i obviously am in favor of the rockworm idea, what about GIANT rockworms?
[20:43] <MPeti> (ignore the ??)
[20:43] <dretch> pathfinding would be simple
[20:43] <MPeti> yeah, I think so too
[20:43] <dretch> rockworm goes directly to a berry along the fastest possible route
[20:43] <dretch> so they'd generally always be going straight or at a calculated angle
[20:43] <dretch> spawn berries as long as proximity to rockworms is greater than X
[20:43] <TerraSleet> what about a rockworm who ends up mistaking your castle wall for a cave?
[20:43] <dretch> seems fairly simple
[20:43] <dretch> that would be
[20:43] <MPeti> and you can place berries to control them :D
[20:43] <dretch> just another part of the game
[20:43] <dretch> yeah!
[20:43] <dretch> berries to ward off critters
[20:43] <dretch> or berries to attract rockworms!
[20:44] <dretch> and then you could kill em for their stuff!
[20:44] <dretch> or if its a big one
[20:44] <dretch> they'd make a tunnel for you!
[20:44] <MPeti> lol
[20:44] <dretch> i mean, they'd go slow
[20:44] <MPeti> but they'd be slow
[20:44] <MPeti> still, it'd be fun to
[20:44] <dretch> probably one block of stone every 3-7 seconds for the average ones
[20:44] <dretch> and babies would just hang around in the same spot til they grew
[20:44] <MPeti> have them break into you underground base while you're there :D
[20:44] <dretch> or i guess no babies.. whatever, it'd be awesome
[20:44] <dretch> hahaha
[20:44] <dretch> maybe a rare carniverous rockworm
[20:44] <dretch> real big guy, spikey, carves a 2x2 cave
[20:44] <dretch> tries to eat ya
[20:45] <dretch> that'd be cool
[20:45] <MPeti> By the way, did notch say anything about boats yet? I'm curious
[20:45] <dretch> or lol, you get eaten
[20:45] <dretch> and he starts digesting you slowly with acid
[20:45] <dretch> and you mine your way out LOL
[20:45] <MPeti> lol
[20:45] <dretch> or throw dynamite down there
[20:45] <dretch> that'd be hilarious
[20:45] <dretch> i'd love a boat, you could make em easy too
[20:45] <MPeti> yeah, agreed
[20:45] <dretch> and you could just paddle yourself across the ocean
[20:45] <MPeti> lol
[20:45] <dretch> waaaaaay faster and safer if sharks and stuff are implemented
[20:46] <MPeti> and maybe boats where more people can get on
[20:46] <MPeti> one drives the boat, other 1 or 2 use their bows
[20:46] <dretch> you know i was trying to figure out how to make BIG things
[20:46] <MPeti> imagine a raiding party with 5 of these boats
[20:46] <dretch> for example, some kind of medical facility
[20:46] <dretch> with beds and whatever
[20:46] * Sickofguessing (Sickofgues@5ad2912a.bb.sky.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[20:46] <dretch> and boats, and maybe bicycles or some other form of wheeled transport
[20:46] <MPeti> Whhat do you mean?
[20:46] <dretch> and i thought
[20:46] <Notch> infdev's been updated.
[20:46] <bildramer> Notch, wanna play Rise of Nations?
[20:46] <bildramer> :>
[20:46] <dretch> what about a plan of some kind?
[20:46] <MPeti> Niiice :D
[20:47] <dretch> something like from RTS games where you click a building plan
[20:47] <bildramer> What's new?
[20:47] <dretch> and you hover over an area
[20:47] <MPeti> * loooks at blog *
[20:47] <dretch> and it sets the plan and outlines all the parts
[20:47] <Notch> i blogged the news. =)
[20:47] <dretch> then you could build a boat out of wood, a big one, if you placed the plan in deep enough water
[20:47] <bildramer> oh, well
[20:47] <dretch> and you'd have to like, make scaffolds to do it properly, and then when it was constructed, it'd have set properties
[20:47] <bildramer> Do you have Age of Empires 1 or 2 or Rise of Nations?
[20:47] * Dandistine (biocon8600@136.176.103.142) has joined #minecraft
[20:47] <bildramer> :l
[20:47] <dretch> so you could have various boats made out of different plans, that'd be awesome
[20:47] <bildramer> that would be awesome, playing a RTS game with Notch
[20:47] <bildramer> and getting pwned

[20:48] <whatdoesth> No! Did you "fix" pigs jumping off cliffs?
[20:48] <MPeti> Done reading
[20:48] <MPeti> lol at above stuff
[20:48] <MPeti> Notch, I supposed you're not here anymore?
[20:48] <dretch> HES BUSY
[20:48] <dretch> LET THE MAN DO HIS WORK
[20:49] <MPeti> lol I know
[20:49] <MPeti> I was just asking
[20:49] <dretch> i'm glad planted trees now use the right type
[20:49] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.2.216) has joined #minecraft
[20:49] <MPeti> because if he was, I'd have asked about boats
[20:49] <dretch> i hated those ugly ones, they were fine before but now
[20:49] <dretch> yeah, vehicles though...
[20:49] <whatdoesth> ; ; That was the most awesome thing I'd seen in Minecraft, especially since there were so many of the damned things...
[20:49] <dretch> multiplayer and caves are a higher priority i'd think
[20:49] <MPeti> maybe I'll start infdeving again... I got angry when my stuff disappeared somehow, though
[20:50] <MPeti> I knew I was going for a dangerous expedition
[20:50] <dretch> Notch if you get a chance, could you tell us whether or not torches have any effect on pigs/sheep spawning, or are they unaffected by light?
[20:50] <MPeti> so I put my valuable stuff in my chest
[20:50] <MPeti> I died
[20:50] <Notch> iirc, they can spawn in torchlight
[20:50] <MPeti> and my stuff wasn't there anymore -.-
[20:50] <MPeti> nice :D
[20:50] <Notch> I'm planning on changing some of that around
[20:50] <dretch> alright thanks mate, gonna cover my base in torches then
[20:50] <Ten_Tacles> Hey
[20:50] <Ten_Tacles> :O
[20:50] <Notch> well, perhaps not
[20:50] <Notch> it's pretty fun. :D
[20:50] <dretch> speaking of the critters, any idea on changing whether or not they can push you off cliffs?
[20:50] <MPeti> It is! :D
[20:50] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[20:50] <dretch> i've only had one pig related plummeting death, but its kinda ... wierd.
[20:50] <Notch> I love it that they can :D
[20:50] <dretch> hahahaha
[20:50] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, will you add more enemys?
[20:51] <Notch> yes, Ten_Tacles
[20:51] <dretch> maybe code the AI so they want to avoid players like real animals would?
[20:51] <Notch> absolutely
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> Coo
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> L
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> What sort of enemys?
[20:51] <Notch> yeah, more ai behavior is coming
[20:51] <dretch> or do you prefer pig attacks
[20:51] <Notch> monster infighting, for example
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> Special enemys?
[20:51] <dretch> hahaha alright cool.
[20:51] <Notch> i looooove infighting
[20:51] <dretch> infighting!
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> YAY
[20:51] <dretch> oh man!
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[20:51] <MPeti> And did you think about boats or other vehicles?
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, what do you NOT love?
[20:51] <Notch> first up is monsters aggroing when getting hit by another monster
[20:51] <Notch> I don't love ladders.
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> oh yeah.
[20:51] <Notch> .. so, a skeleton + a zombie = yay
[20:51] <dretch> oh, i also wanted to ask, what happens when a creeper is killed by another creeper
[20:51] <Notch> or even skeleton + creeper
[20:51] <Ten_Tacles> You will add them anyway :D
[20:51] <dretch> do they have a chance to drop gunpowder or not?
[20:52] <dretch> or do they just automatically explode or die...?
[20:52] <Notch> when they don't explode and die, they can drop it
[20:52] <dretch> if killed by another creeper's explosion though?
[20:52] <Notch> so getting exploded by a creeper means the second one can drop
[20:52] <bildramer> Notch, you dislike RTS games?
[20:52] <bildramer> guess so
[20:52] <MPeti> Are you going to add boats when MP works well or sometime?
[20:52] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, make big bugs for chitin that battle with spiders :D
[20:52] <bildramer> what's with the slime mobs?
[20:52] <bildramer> just a hoax?
[20:52] <dretch> slime mobs?
[20:52] <Notch> i kind of dislike them
[20:52] <Quatroking> yay Notch started to talk
[20:52] <Ten_Tacles> Slime?
[20:53] <Notch> turn based strategy is more fun
[20:53] <Ten_Tacles> Duh
[20:53] <Quatroking> Notch, how about making animals afraid of fire
[20:53] <Notch> I've been keeping half an eye on the chat
[20:53] <Ten_Tacles> I like both :D
[20:53] <dretch> i like turn based strategy too
[20:53] <MPeti> Notch, are you going to make boats or any other vehicles?
[20:53] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[20:53] <Notch> maybe, Quatroking
[20:53] <Quatroking> so these goddamn pigs stop raining ham into my base
[20:53] <Notch> if it's fun
[20:53] <Ten_Tacles> Spider rider XD
[20:53] <dretch> hahahaha ham rain
[20:53] <MPeti> Oh, I heard you confirmed minecarts... but what about others?
[20:53] <dretch> minecarts!
[20:53] <Ten_Tacles> Duh
[20:53] <Notch> the suicidal tendencies should be fixed now, Quatroking. ;D
[20:53] <dretch> will we have to lay down track?
[20:53] <Quatroking> also its not really awesome to have pigs and sheep pushing you around when you're working on bridges above LAVA
[20:53] <Notch> yes, if I add carts, you'll need to lay tracks
[20:54] <Notch> yes it is! :D
[20:54] <MPeti> and boats or other vehicles?
[20:54] <dretch> its kinda annoying
[20:54] <Quatroking> it already happened twice that I almost died because some idiot pig jumped on me
[20:54] <dretch> but you can avoid that
[20:54] <MPeti> I'd love a special way to travel across the oceans
[20:54] <dretch> the areas on which you are working
[20:54] <Quatroking> why do they behave like they want to rape me so much, Notch?
[20:54] <dretch> you can make a trench before em
[20:54] <dretch> yeah thats always a little wierd
[20:54] <dretch> they're like.. dogs trying to hump your leg
[20:54] <Notch> they're friendly!
[20:54] <dretch> but theres a LOT of em
[20:54] <dretch> and they push you
[20:54] <dretch> and i make a bunch of iron swords and i always break em -_-
[20:54] <Quatroking> ...
[20:54] <MPeti> The strange thing is, I didn't get anywhere as many as in the pictures I saw from others
[20:54] * Quatroking gasps
[20:55] <MPeti> still a lot, though
[20:55] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, make some worm pobs
[20:55] <Quatroking> Notch secretly has a pig rape fetish!
[20:55] <Quatroking> oh mah gawd

[20:55] <Ten_Tacles> *mobs

[20:57] <MPeti> Greatness!!
[20:57] <ZomBuster> Notch you don't caves influence the terrain generation speed much?
[20:57] <bildramer> Also, how hard is it to bribe you to invite someone?
[20:57] <ZomBuster> think*
[20:57] <Emperor> notch let me give you head
[20:57] <bildramer> 1000$? 4000$?

[20:57] <Notch> I've given it a few shots
[20:57] <Notch> one today
[20:57] <Quatroking> will there be a possibility to share infdev levels
[20:57] <Notch> but it never turns out good
[20:57] <bildramer> Multiplayer woot
[20:57] <Emperor> i really loved indev cave shapes
[20:57] <ZomBuster> ah like that
[20:57] <Quatroking> so I can spam others with my awesome base

[20:57] <bildramer> :D
[20:57] <dretch> the indev caves were fantastic
[20:57] <MPeti> I'd post this in the forums, but I want to read whatever else you say here :D
[20:57] <Ruska> Is you kitchen made of cubes?
[20:57] <Ruska> your*

[20:58] <Ten_Tacles> Message flood
[20:58] <Ruska> Haha
[20:58] <Ruska> That'd be awesome
[20:58] <bildramer> Multiplayer, I mean
[20:58] <dretch> i'd think for infdev, the same as indev but generating caves when players are in proximity
[20:58] <Notch> but I'll try to get the mp tests out as soon as I can. =)
[20:58] <bildramer> :>
[20:58] <dretch> procedurally done, would that lag it too much?
[20:58] <zeroZshadow> :P
[20:58] <bildramer> Lego bricks melt
[20:58] <bildramer> :/
[20:58] <Notch> that could possibly work
[20:58] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, will you make MP tests before release?
[20:58] <Notch> yes
[20:58] <bildramer> the oven will suck
[20:58] <dretch> that way you don't have to generate an impossible amount of caves
[20:58] <Ten_Tacles> Invite me please :D

[21:10] <Emperor> Finally, a warning:
[21:10] <Emperor> Don?t delete the level you?re currently playing. It won?t explode your computer or anything, but it will produce strange results.
[21:10] <Emperor> this makes me wanna delete a save and see what happens
[21:10] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[21:10] <Ten_Tacles> Do it and then do it and then do it again.
[21:10] <Ten_Tacles> :p
[21:10] <Emperor> Also, I fixed a couple of major bugs in the spawning code which let them spawn in bright areas.. Sorry about that.

[21:14] <NGgod> should i shut my server down to play infdev?
[21:14] <Ruska> no
[21:14] <unt> i'm wondering is it not playing nice with my CPU? I have an i7 920 and it's still going about ~60fps
[21:14] <Marach> unt: no reason to complain
[21:14] <Emperor> im getting 110fps atm with a 955
[21:14] <Ruska> try a different browser, sometimes it helps
[21:15] <NGgod> my server is a bandwidth and RAM hog
[21:15] <unt> Marach I wouldn't usually but compared to what it used to be and it still feels a bit choppy :p
[21:15] <unt> but this update is gooood :)
[21:15] <NGgod> so i cant play infdev with it up
[21:15] <Marach> 60 fps can't be choppy
[21:15] <Marach> 25 is fluid
[21:15] <unt> I mean it doesn't stay constant
[21:15] <Lu-Mi> opera works better with java than firefox, atleast for me

[23:10] <TerraSleet> PM a mod about it then
[23:10] <TerraSleet> don't make another thread
[23:11] <Quatroking> I made another thread, because hey, if the moderation doesn't give a shit about whats spam and whats not, then why should I?
[23:11] <Varriount> I don't think the mods will ban Quatroking, as he's a long time member..
[23:11] <TerraSleet> plus your thread was basically trolling people who like the dragons

[23:22] <bildramer> telling the Turks to gtfo after 400 years
[23:22] <vurtual> And it's creepy disgusting looking, as it already had cheese cooked onto it before.
[23:22] <bildramer> also keeping Italian forces from invading making them look like losers and ask help from Adolf

[23:23] <bildramer> uh
[23:23] <bildramer> really
[23:23] <TerraSleet> if best history = jumping into countless wars at the last minute (WW2 included) and claiming all the glory

[23:23] <bildramer> let's kill them all and take over

[23:27] <Yourself> of course, thanks to our NARP (Nuclear Arsenal of Ridiculous Proportion), anyone who does so guarantees themselves nuclear winter
[23:27] <vurtual> Granted, lots goes into coming up with crazy things like one-way energy shields and automated soldier drones.

[23:28] <godhand1942> hmmmmm
[23:28] <TerraSleet> you could
[23:28] <vurtual> Or like, ram into transports with the submarines and go "sup."
[23:28] <TerraSleet> but that would be stupid
[23:28] <Yourself> it's not about winning, TerraSleet, it's about making sure the other guy loses worse
[23:28] <vurtual> then run away really fast

[23:28] <Yourself> <TerraSleet> you would end up with a tsunami wiping out western US
[23:29] <Konogan> I'm pretty sure every other country would just come aid china.
[23:29] <TerraSleet> along with china
[23:29] <Yourself> only if you detonated every single nuclear weapon in the exact same spot at the exact same time
[23:29] <vurtual> Japan would help the US probably, we're apparently required to help them during wars and China might not like them.

[23:29] <bildramer> durr
[23:29] <Brett> @Lu-Mi: wat
[23:30] <vurtual> Yes, NK would invade China.
[23:30] <Konogan> Let's take Hydrogen bombs instead :D
[23:30] <Marach> bildramer: that happened everywhere else, just sooner
[23:30] <vurtual> North Korea is best Korea duh.
[23:30] <bildramer> we should really make antimatter bombs soon
[23:30] <bildramer> only the explosion
[23:30] <vurtual> We're working on it.

[23:30] <godhand1942> china assimilated all their other conquerers anyhow
[23:30] <Marach> meh, brb. can't wait to check out Autechre latest album

[23:31] <Lu-Mi> Brett >in their explosion
[23:31] <godhand1942> lol
[23:31] <vurtual> Anyways no, China alone could not beat the USA.
[23:31] <Lu-Mi> lrn2read
[23:31] <bildramer> we really need fucking antimatter bombs
[23:31] <vurtual> that breed into more bomns!?
[23:31] <bildramer> also, I wonder why we can't convert matter into energy easily enough
[23:31] <TerraSleet> try containing antimatter dildramer
[23:31] <Brett> i am reading, Lu, and I fail to see the logic behind that statement
[23:31] <TerraSleet> you'll see why they don't exist
[23:31] <Konogan> Chances are, Russia would help China.
[23:31] <vurtual> magnetics TerraSleet\
[23:31] <bildramer> say we have an amount of matter
[23:31] <bildramer> X
[23:31] <Marach> ...i heard it's great.
[23:31] <Brett> the concussive shock from the explosion alone is incomparable
[23:31] <bildramer> and an equal amount of antimatter
[23:31] <Konogan> Now that would be sweet.
[23:31] <bildramer> ~X
[23:32] <Brett> that doesn't factor in heat
[23:32] <TerraSleet> you won't be able to hold it in a bomb
[23:32] <TerraSleet> with magnetics
[23:32] <Marach> haha, someone's already uploaded it to grooveshark
[23:32] <godhand1942> Nah russia and china dont get along
[23:32] <Yourself> <bildramer> we really need fucking antimatter bombs
[23:32] <bildramer> X + ~X = 2energy(X)
[23:32] <vurtual> Give it time.
[23:32] <TerraSleet> unless it's a bomb the size of a plane
[23:32] <Yourself> not sure that would do as much as you might think
[23:32] <Lu-Mi> nukes dont make such a big boom, its the radiation that makes them so "powerful"
[23:32] <bildramer> so
[23:32] <godhand1942> when both were communist they didnt get along
[23:32] <bildramer> then
[23:32] <vurtual> We have fairly intelligent robots now
[23:32] <bildramer> convert 1 of the 2 energy equivalents of matter to antimatter
[23:32] <vurtual> We WENT TO THE MOON, with the power of a calculator!
[23:32] <TerraSleet> russia doesn't get along with anything
[23:32] <Yourself> it'd probably just produce a huge number of neutrinos
[23:32] <TerraSleet> they'd probably just nuke the shit out of everyone
[23:32] <bildramer> then get a random amount of X matter passing by
[23:32] <Yourself> which would then proceed to do absolutely nothing
[23:32] <bildramer> then, repeat
[23:32] <bildramer> tada
[23:32] <Lu-Mi> the radiation is multiple times the radius of the actual explosion
[23:32] <bildramer> very very very much energy
[23:32] <Brett> lu-mi: you're either trollin or ... trolling, i refuse to believe you actually could say that
[23:32] <vurtual> Also, Russia's our buddy now mostly.
[23:32] <Konogan> I didn't say alliance, maybe more "Mutual Ennemy".
[23:33] <Brett> perhaps you're thinking of a dirty bomb
[23:33] <bildramer> for practically free

[23:33] <godhand1942> they are already being assimilated by asians
[23:33] <Brett> nukes generally create very little fallout in an air burst
[23:33] <godhand1942> go to vancouver, toronto
[23:33] <godhand1942> full of asians
[23:33] <godhand1942> montreal
[23:33] <bildramer> the radiation is just the FINISH HIM!
[23:34] <Marafk> wow, niec lag
[23:34] <bildramer> where him is the city
[23:34] <Rijjka> WE have one of the most effective anti invasion deterents ever. It's the same thing that russia uses. Realy cold winters
[23:34] <godhand1942> Canada has no chance
[23:34] <Brett> if the fireball doesn't consume anything, there's no fallout
[23:34] <bildramer> also
[23:34] <Rijjka> It stopped napoleon in moscow!
[23:34] <Konogan> I wonder who would Canada ally to.
[23:34] <bildramer> someone tell my why the fuck that won't work
[23:34] <Brett> the more that's caught up in the fireball, the more fallout, the more radiation distribution
[23:34] <Brett> there's a huge amount of thermal radiation, though
[23:34] <godhand1942> Canada would ally with USA
[23:34] <bildramer> converting energy into matter
[23:34] <bildramer> er
[23:34] <Lu-Mi> actually no. there are bombs that have bigger potential in their explosion force
[23:34] <godhand1942> no doubt about that
[23:34] <TerraSleet> canada would be neutral
[23:34] <bildramer> matter into energy
[23:34] <TerraSleet> i'd gaurantee it
[23:34] <Rijjka> The west would allie with the states, the east would argue.
[23:34] <bildramer> E = mc^2
[23:34] <godhand1942> no they would go with the States
[23:34] <Rijjka> In canada
[23:34] <godhand1942> they trade so much with the states
[23:34] <Lu-Mi> they're just not as cheap as nukes
[23:34] <Yourself> <bildramer> matter into energy
[23:34] <TerraSleet> however if china took the opportunity to invade from Alaska, Canad would probably start defending
[23:34] <bildramer> so a gram could power a country or two or something
[23:34] <godhand1942> that ithey would be stupid not to
[23:35] <Yourself> that's what a nuke is
[23:35] <bildramer> I know
[23:35] <bildramer> but, wait, no
[23:35] <bildramer> a nuke is bonds between matter -> energy
[23:35] <Yourself> no, it isn't
[23:35] <TerraSleet> no
[23:35] <bildramer> I want to annihilate matter
[23:35] <bildramer> what.
[23:35] <Yourself> that's a chemical explosion
[23:35] <Konogan> Well, I think they would try to stay neutral.
[23:35] <bildramer> The nucleus
[23:35] <Rijjka> The west would start defending, Quebec would quibble out how the invasion would effect their soverinty
[23:35] <Yourself> TNT is chemical bonds
[23:35] <TerraSleet> a nuke is nuclear fussion
[23:35] <bildramer> nothing just randomly vanishes
[23:35] <bildramer> dude
[23:35] <Yourself> fission
[23:35] <Konogan> Rijjka LOL.
[23:35] <TerraSleet> fission* i typoed
[23:35] <bildramer> it just splits up
[23:35] <vurtual> Canada has a small army.
[23:35] <godhand1942> lol a nuke is nuclear FISSION
[23:35] <bildramer> matter to energy is something else
[23:35] <godhand1942> not created due to bonds
[23:35] <godhand1942> but rather critical mass
[23:36] <bildramer> um
[23:36] <vurtual> no it's fussion, it's like "fission", with an "u" sound
[23:36] <bildramer> wtf.
[23:36] <TerraSleet> bildramer, matter to energy = annihilation
[23:36] <Konogan> Vurtual, Small but well trained :P
[23:36] <vurtual> you are simeltaneously adding and removing atoms
[23:36] <godhand1942> its FISSION
[23:36] <Lu-Mi> FUSSion
[23:36] <vurtual> A nice army, but a small army.
[23:36] <Yourself> a fission bomb produces energy because when the uranium or plutonium splits, the resulting atoms actually have slightly less mass than the original atom did
[23:36] <godhand1942> lol not fusion
[23:36] <bildramer> Nucleus = protons + neutrons
[23:36] <godhand1942> the sun is fusion
[23:36] <setveen> moo
[23:36] <godhand1942> nukes use fission
[23:36] <vurtual> someone say total annihilation?
[23:36] <TrueWolves> <Yourself> a fission bomb produces energy because when the uranium or plutonium splits, the resulting atoms actually have slightly less mass than the original atom did
[23:36] <bildramer> Yourself: slightly less mass, same particles
[23:36] <Lu-Mi> get it? thats what all the FUSS is about
[23:36] <vurtual> I loved that game.
[23:36] * Lu-Mi gets her coat
[23:36] <bildramer> I want to fucking remove that bitch
[23:36] <bildramer> mass
[23:36] <Yourself> fusion is similar only you smack atoms together instead of split them apart
[23:36] <Yourself> <bildramer> Yourself: slightly less mass, same particles
[23:36] <setveen> moo
[23:36] <bildramer> matter + antimatter = energy + energy
[23:36] <Yourself> doesn't matter
[23:36] <Konogan> The thing is, we don't really need an army.
[23:36] <Konogan> :P
[23:36] <bildramer> well
[23:36] <Yourself> that slightly less mass is carried off as energy
[23:36] <bildramer> Yes
[23:36] <TerraSleet> photonic energy, bildramer
[23:37] <bildramer> If you accidentally the whole mass
[23:37] <bildramer> what happen
[23:37] <bildramer> Well
[23:37] <bildramer> nevermind that
[23:37] <Lu-Mi> /0
[23:37] <Yourself> well the only way to do that would be to collide it with its anti-particle
[23:37] <bildramer> I wonder why we can't just convert matter to energy easily
[23:37] <TerraSleet> which is why he was talking about the antimatter bomb
[23:37] <bildramer> there's a flaw somewhere
[23:37] <vurtual> anyways guys
[23:37] <vurtual> what does antimatter look like?
[23:37] <TerraSleet> because you need energy to do that bil
[23:37] <bildramer> if we have matter + antimatter, we get 2 energy units of something
[23:37] <godhand1942> bil u need energy to do that
[23:38] <TerraSleet> antimatter looks like matter
[23:38] <godhand1942> and furthermore u lose
[23:38] <Yourself> if it was so easy, atoms wouldn't be stable
[23:38] <bildramer> then 1 of them gets used to make antimatter
[23:38] <godhand1942> energy to the surroundingsg
[23:38] <TerraSleet> it's exactly the same properties but opposite change
[23:38] <Yourself> everything would just blow up
[23:38] * xandersears (Mibbit@fluffy.hairydog.co.uk) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[23:38] <bildramer> and we add 1 unit of matter
[23:38] <bildramer> yes
[23:38] <bildramer> but we surely can control that
[23:38] <vurtual> You know, if matter and antimatter looked inverted in some way to eachother, due to our eyes being matter
[23:38] <Rijjka> Look look, guys, a classic Nuclear device is Nuclear Fission. A hydrogen bomb is a fission assited fusion bomb.
[23:38] <Yourself> we do, it's called nuclear power
[23:38] <vurtual> You could make an antimatter camera

[23:38] <vurtual> then make a wi-fi signal for it
[23:38] <TerraSleet> vurtual, you see antimatter by photons hitting it
[23:38] <bildramer> Yourself: still won't understand
[23:38] <TerraSleet> no such thing as antiphotons (afaik)
[23:39] <bildramer> antimatter =/= nuclear stuff
[23:39] <vurtual> and then get pictures that were recieved by the antimatter camera, so they look "normal"
[23:39] <vurtual> then again
[23:39] <vurtual> if they look the same then this is useless
[23:39] <TerraSleet> they do
[23:39] <bildramer> vurtual: they'll just emit photons I think
[23:39] <Yourself> <bildramer> Yourself: still won't understand
[23:39] <Yourself> no, that's just you
[23:39] <bildramer> :/
[23:39] <bildramer> well
[23:39] <bildramer> I'm talking about something different
[23:39] <TerraSleet> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihydrogen
[23:39] <Yourself> nuclear power is matter -> energy
[23:39] <igotyou> the site is down !
[23:39] <bildramer> we can convert a part of the mass into energy
[23:39] <Brett> @terra: a photon is its own negator
[23:39] <bildramer> yeah
[23:39] <igotyou> why is it down :(
[23:40] <bildramer> but it must be a specific structure (uranium) etc.
[23:40] <godhand1942> the site is down cuz our nuke talk put it down
[23:40] * Cial (chatzilla@209-42-180-61.wispnet.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[23:40] <bildramer> with antimatter, we could just throw random atoms at it
[23:40] <bildramer> somehow
[23:40] <godhand1942> the site is not down
[23:40] <Yourself> actually, you could do it with anything heavier than iron
[23:40] <Yourself> fission, that is
[23:40] <bildramer> yeah

[23:40] <bildramer> But you'll need lots of energy to start that, amirite
[23:40] <Yourself> you could do it with things lighter than iron, but you'd lose energy in the process
[23:40] <Yourself> yes
[23:41] <Lu-Mi> gotta accelerate something fast enough to hit it
[23:41] <vurtual> LHC?
[23:41] <Brett> large hardon collider
[23:41] <Lu-Mi> large hardon collider
[23:41] <Lu-Mi> ^5
[23:41] <setveen> hadron*
[23:41] <TerraSleet> you need a lot of energy to split an atom, unless said atom is unstable to the point a neutron will destabilize it (in the case of elements like uranium/plutonium)
[23:41] <Yourself> anyway, even in matter-antimatter collisions, most of the energy is carried off by neutrinos
[23:42] <Brett> i'm aware, thanks
[23:42] <TerraSleet> Yourself: no
[23:42] <bildramer> well, X + ~X = 2x -> x + ~X -- add X -> x + X + ~X -- remove x -> repeat, where X = matter, ~X = antimatter, x = energy amount equal to the matter
[23:42] <Yourself> TerraSleet about half of it is
[23:42] <bildramer> oh
[23:42] <Konogan> To split an atom, call Chuck Norris. He can do it with his bare hands.
[23:42] <bildramer> so yeah
[23:42] <bildramer> neutrinos
[23:42] <Yourself> so maybe not most, but a sizeable portion
[23:42] <bildramer> that's why I can just fuck the idea and forget it, thanks

[23:46] <bildramer> a gram of what? :|
[23:46] <Konogan> Weird, the LHC shutdowns on 2012?
[23:46] <KodaichiZero|Quake> if you wanna add me, ign is KodaichiZero
[23:46] <TerraSleet> you'd just see a flash

[23:46] <TerraSleet> if anything at all
[23:46] <Brett> Konogan: it has to, the world ends then
[23:46] <bildramer> but the people will probably die anyway
[23:46] <Yourself> leaving you with about 10 kilotons of actual equivalent yield
[23:46] <TerraSleet> most likely everything would be radiated as gamma rays or other light
[23:46] <TerraSleet> and neutrinoes
[23:47] <Brett> gamma rays would fuck some shit up though
[23:47] <Konogan> Death is nothing anyway.
[23:47] <bildramer> fuck neutrinos

[23:47] <bildramer> let's see the amount of atoms that is in an 1L water bottle was antimatter

[23:48] <TerraSleet> that's a rediculous though

[23:51] <bildramer> it's pretty obvious, but nevertheless
