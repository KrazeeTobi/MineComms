[0:37] <SireTRM> Multiplayer 1.0.x creative to make awesome things for single-player survival.
[0:38] <CyborgDragon> seriously, overlord, QUIT WHINING
[0:38] <sana> maybe you should consider playing better games
[0:38] <CyborgDragon> you cant say notch is on valvetime, because he has never given an official release date for SMP until just now
[0:38] <sana> published by multi million companies who push their development teams hard to meet deadlines
[0:38] <SireTRM> Then, by December, we can have SMP working towards Beta.
[0:38] <sana> notch is chillin' and raking in the money from ten year olds
[0:38] <sana> and it's enviable!
[0:39] <sana> working at his own pace, having fun with code every friday
[0:39] <Overlord> yes no accountability
[0:39] <SireTRM> Oh, and in five years, we will be able to develop our own MC ports and features when it is released as open source.

[0:44] <SireTRM> I have no clue how you might hose a dedicated server and you will want to retain fast control over the server files.
[0:44] <CyborgDragon> he's asking if anybody knows of a server he could rent to host his own
[0:44] <Kokopure> make sure you have a good internet connection.
[0:44] <Kokopure> that's really all there is to it.
[0:45] <chimp> yes cyborg thats right, my home bandwidth is puny and erratic
[0:45] <Kokopure> in that case

[1:21] <CyborgDragon> and then there's the oil spill sitting on our beach -.-
[1:21] <vurtual> "At least I have friends."
[1:21] <vurtual> then I held him at gunpoint
[1:22] <vurtual> He let out a womanly scream, and then shouted "I'M A PACAFIST!"

[1:47] <Shadaez> female condoms are so expensive
[1:47] <CyborgDragon> basically, by biomes, notch meant he was gonna make islands that had snow on them, and islands that didnt
[1:47] <vurtual> Can we all start in a dungeon?
[1:47] <CyborgDragon> and eventually we'd get other biome types like desert, hopefully
[1:47] <Riyuzakisan> biomes. examples: tundra, desert, wetland, tropical, forest, marshes, coral reefs, etc
[1:47] <rob`> snow is probably less a biome thing and more a season thing
[1:47] <vurtual> That has a stupid way to figure the exit to?
[1:47] <Quatroking> I sure hope Notch will add wasteland too
[1:47] <vurtual> And then it's snowing on that island?

[3:33] <CyborgDragon> well vurt, mine is the full deathstar, meaning my planet will surely be destroyed
[3:33] <vede> app13, is the filename "server_level.dat"?

[3:34] <vede> app13, where did you get the map file?
[3:34] <app13> It was a ZOMG generated file I believe

[3:34] <CyborgDragon> tukiko, that's what i've been saying!

[3:34] <CyborgDragon> their attack radius is decreased, they are still hostile

[3:34] <Snake> Tukiko: wat
[3:34] <vede> app13, is it in the right directory, and are you restarting the server when you try to change the map?
[3:34] <CyborgDragon> it was cial and KodaichiZerp who were saying otherwise
[3:34] <Snake> I've tried to jump on them and they did nothing

[3:35] <vurtual> which would look like one of those lasery toys
[3:35] <app13> @vede It is in the same directory as the start_server.bat, and yes.
[3:35] <vurtual> The Death Star IV would be ready to fire before it initially fired
[3:35] <vede> app13, what happens when you try to start the server?
[3:35] <Draconicus> If I branch it to three memory cells I should be able to produce reliable 'minute' indication.
[3:35] <KodaichiZerp> I could have been really lucky, but I swear I've pushed them around as of the red dust update

[3:54] <Nyutan> Are we related?
[3:54] <vurtual> as long as you are a long-term xbox user

[3:55] <vurtual> A real man does not need a degree, his pure ability can get him a job.
[3:55] <AhrenJB> I've got like 6-7g.
[3:55] <vurtual> For example, a tech job? Fixin' servers, for some reason?
[3:55] <vurtual> Guy asks for a degree?
[3:55] * Nyutan agrees with Vurtual
[3:55] <AhrenJB> Fucking jobs. I just got laid off.
[3:55] <vurtual> Open the curtain, and dial a number on your phone, which plays a little tune
[3:55] <vurtual> while the windows of the nearby buildings flash in tune with it
[3:56] <Nyutan> I haven't graduated College yet people pay me to fix their computers. I'm a professional.

[3:56] <KodaichiZerp> no sane man would hire you for something that technical without any certification, but it can be done
[3:56] <sorre> >business
[3:56] <sorre> >sane
[3:56] <KodaichiZerp> ^that's the trick

[3:56] * CyborgDragon was almost oracle certified
[3:56] <vurtual> because you set up a small scrap phone to give a signal to a computer when called, causing all of the building lights, which you bypassed security for(thanks to new off-site lighting control), to flash in tune with your phone
[3:56] * CyborgDragon got bored of databases

[3:56] * CyborgDragon didnt even take the oracle certification test
[3:57] <vurtual> which are both synced by metronome in the form of an atomic clock
[3:57] <CyborgDragon> and the worst part, i could have taken it for free
[3:57] <KodaichiZerp> guess you meant DoS
[3:57] <CyborgDragon> now i'll have to pay to take it
[3:57] <RaidSoft> am I the only one getting weird mouse sensitivity issues lately?
[3:57] * rob` looks up. While certification is not necessary, certification helps prove to a potential employer that you have ability.
[3:57] <vurtual> and you set this up for every potential job interview
[3:57] <Nyutan> Don't correct me.
[3:57] <vurtual> THAT
[3:57] <vurtual> is better than ANY degree
[3:58] <Zode> DDOS = dos but better, >_> Dos = Denial of service attack (so its same thing :U)
[3:58] <rob`> I'm working on my CCNA, it'll make me eligible for a couple of $60k/year jobs I've got my eye on
[3:58] <vurtual> zode
[3:58] <Nyutan> "Distributed Denial of Service"
[3:58] <Nyutan> DDOS.
[3:58] <vurtual> I'm sorry to say this but
[3:58] <Nyutan> K?
[3:58] <vurtual> you are dumb.
[3:58] <vede> Fuck stable jobs. Real men leave home and wander the earth first chance they get.

[3:58] <KodaichiZerp> vurtual, I think they'd be too scared to hire you, possibly even report you
[3:58] <CyborgDragon> vede, GET OUT OF MY HEAD
[3:58] <vurtual> KodaichiZerp, the phones all call you
[3:58] <sorre> ...or maybe they'd be too scared to NOT hire you?
[3:58] <Nyutan> Stupidity is terminal illness? :o
[3:58] <Newe6000> Hey guys
[3:59] <CyborgDragon> hello
[3:59] <Newe6000> First time on this chat :/
[3:59] <Nyutan> Welcome.
[3:59] <Newe6000> Sorry if i just changed the subject
[3:59] <vurtual> the doors all have their codes reset during the run, and you also have set up, previously, a remote central administration system, and just need to roll out the control panels.
[3:59] <Nyutan> You didn't.
[3:59] <Newe6000> Lol
[3:59] <CyborgDragon> first lesson: just because this is the minecraft irc channel, doesnt mean we have to discuss minecraft 24/7
[3:59] <vurtual> So, basically, you, for free, made them have tenth the costs
[3:59] <Nyutan> Om nom nom.
[3:59] <RaidSoft> sooo nobody else getting strange sensitivity issues? it's like the sens keeps changing by itself randomly for me and it's reallllllyy starting to bug me
[3:59] <vurtual> vede
[4:00] <Foe> Argh, the suggestions are dumbing down, hard
[4:00] <Nyutan> 1 person barely effects a chat of 201 other people in the room.
[4:00] <Zode> also what i should do with rest of that red stuff? (i alrdy have (needs button to start timer) timer based door security and after that i have pressureplate (metal) Maze P:)
[4:00] <vurtual> Real men explore the world to confront and defeat all the greatest warriors ever
[4:00] <vurtual> before winning a world fighting championship
[4:00] <vede> vurtual, I thought that was implied.
[4:00] <vede> :/
[4:00] <vurtual> systematically
[4:00] <vurtual> in every province of Earth
[4:00] <vurtual> one by one
[4:00] <KodaichiZerp> real men lack the female reproductive organs.
[4:00] <vurtual> all while being ten
[4:01] <CyborgDragon> hey, i almost did that when i was 10
[4:01] <CyborgDragon> no seriously, i almost ran away when i was 10
[4:01] <Nyutan> Real men vary.
[4:01] <vurtual> I ran away when I was like... 8?
[4:01] <vurtual> maybe 3?
[4:01] <vurtual> 5? I don't know
[4:01] <CyborgDragon> but now im mooching off my dad's free healthcare from the government
[4:01] <vurtual> actually, not really
[4:01] <vurtual> I was just bored of cleaning up something and went out the front door
[4:01] <CyborgDragon> because i need to have my chest fixed before my ribs crush my heart
[4:01] <vurtual> and went out into the woods by my house, and chilled
[4:01] <Newe6000> I tryed running away, Lol it failed badly
[4:02] <CyborgDragon> and if i dont have to pay for it, all the better
[4:02] <vurtual> when I had come back, my mom almost called the police.
[4:02] <vurtual> Afterwards those kinds of situations pretty much ended.
[4:02] <Newe6000> Thats good
[4:02] <KodaichiZerp> my mom's sister legit ran away from home when she was little, they never saw her again
[4:02] <CyborgDragon> so basically, running away got you no chores?
[4:02] <Newe6000> :O
[4:03] <Zode> any1 noticed that when you load the switches are randomly activated O_o
[4:03] <vurtual> no more like
[4:03] <vurtual> going into my backyard
[4:03] <CyborgDragon> not for me zode
[4:03] * Shinki (Diablo@dhcp10-185.geusnet.com) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)

[4:03] <Newe6000> @zode Nope
[4:03] <vurtual> when I was like, 12, I had figured out our router password
[4:04] <CyborgDragon> i still havent figured out mine
[4:04] <Newe6000> Lol, What did you do with it.
[4:04] <CyborgDragon> my dad's too smart
[4:04] <vurtual> Now I have pretty much an unquestioned control, most everyone probably assuming someone else told me
[4:04] * Zode makes suspecious face @switches
[4:04] <vede> Aaand suddenly vurtual has dominated the conversation and turned into another ego-masturbation session.
[4:04] <KodaichiZerp> I'm almost 20 now, I should go fight some 8 year olds.
[4:04] <vurtual> Newe6000, hosted vidyagame servers
[4:04] <vede> Again.
[4:04] <KodaichiZerp> see how that goes down
[4:04] <vede> Imma go do something else then, I guess.
[4:04] <vurtual> Because it's funny, that's why.
[4:04] <Newe6000> Aswome
[4:04] <vurtual> then I proceeded to do nothing but sit around
[4:04] <vurtual> aaand we're here
[4:04] <Newe6000> Multiple conversations at once FTW
[4:05] <Rooster> Got Pokemon Gold on my Ipod Touch

[4:05] <vurtual> What are you doing playing pokemon gold on an ipod
[4:05] <vurtual> that's silly
[4:05] <vurtual> the cartridge doesn't even fit

[4:06] <vurtual> Well, I have all the metroid games.
[4:06] <sorre> just do cooler stuff
[4:06] <vurtual> :|
[4:06] <sorre> do something ridiculous, hilarious, over-the-top
[4:06] <Newe6000> Vurtual Lol
[4:06] <sorre> something novel
[4:06] <sorre> emulators are so mundane nowadays
[4:07] <vurtual> like become a pilot and invent a new form of military-grade technology
[4:07] <vurtual> and have your first idea to turn it into functional cosplay
[4:07] * CyborgDragon made vurtual feel smaller by saying that he had all 7 best pokemons
[4:07] <sorre> or at least put together a home XBMC box
[4:07] <KodaichiZerp> video games are more fun when I can force my sister to watch me play them
[4:07] <vurtual> I have powered armor, CyborgDragon
[4:07] <vurtual> your argument is invalid
[4:07] <sorre> that reminds me

[4:08] <Rooster> I have nothing to do.
[4:08] * CyborgDragon can play almost any n64 game on his n64
[4:08] <sorre> should've bought a SNES flashcart
[4:08] <sorre> more useful
[4:08] <CyborgDragon> or i will be able, come my birthday, when they'll actually give it to me
[4:08] <vurtual> I will get my friends them, and we will be Gordon Freeman, Doomguy(maybe), Samus Aran, and Iron Man

[4:09] <CyborgDragon> 200 euros, ds flashcart, the fuck man, you got ripped off big time
[4:09] <vurtual> Zode
[4:09] <vurtual> ...
[4:09] <vurtual> You can get those for five USD
[4:09] <vurtual> or, around 5 euros
[4:09] <CyborgDragon> seriously
[4:09] <Zode> note that the flashcard only cost 10 e... those microsd cost more XD
[4:09] <Zode> microsds*
[4:09] <vurtual> ...
[4:09] <sorre> oh, that's different
[4:09] <vurtual> micro SD for about five

[4:11] <vurtual> PC, PS3, or 360?
[4:11] <Furyhunter> PC
[4:11] <vurtual> don't confuse him
[4:11] <sorre> but, seriously, save until you have $250, and invest in an XBMC setup

[4:12] <vurtual> as in, you'd be insane trying to find one that runs GTA IV, but also only does that
[4:13] <vurtual> and unless the 360 can run GTA at 1080p, it will have a hard time.
[4:13] <Zode> also trying to play gta iv on pc with 12 fps ftw
[4:13] <Zode> and then playing it on ps3 and it feels like its speedrunning >:V
[4:13] <vurtual> put it down in resolution then
[4:13] <RaidSoft> also, games being cheaper on PC ftw
[4:13] <vurtual> because you know
[4:13] <vurtual> 1024x768 isn't going to hurt

[4:16] <leBMD> greetings, gentlemen.
[4:16] <Zode> yeah that would be too big XD
[4:16] <RaidSoft> 1600x1200 was a popular non-widescreen res

[4:17] <CyborgDragon> badass*
[4:17] <Zode> ooh those golden days X3
[4:17] <CyborgDragon> played 4.07 lately?
[4:17] <Zode> thougt teh new 4.07 failed it
[4:17] <CyborgDragon> no it didnt
[4:17] <Zode> since imo 3.0 was wayy better than 4.07 :c
[4:17] <CyborgDragon> it's called lowres texture packs
[4:18] <Zode> yeah and 4.07 likes to crash... ALOT
[4:18] <CyborgDragon> no it isnt, 4.07 is better, if you hate the highres models, download a lowres pack
[4:18] <CyborgDragon> not for me, you must have a crap pc
[4:18] <Zode> "Error could not find this and that :3" "error randomerrorhere" "Loldisconnect Soundfail :3"
[4:18] <Zode> >_>
[4:18] <Zode> oh yeah and 4.07 broke entmod :c
[4:19] <vurtual> so
[4:19] <vurtual> I was unwinding some thread
[4:19] <vurtual> because some of it was wrapped around another strand
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> zode, entmod has been fixed
[4:19] <vurtual> and I wanted to get it out
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> it actually broke metamod, not entmod
[4:19] <vurtual> once I finally did though, it was stuck ,tangled
[4:19] <vurtual> and it broke :(
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> and there's a new metamod that fixes it
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> on the sven coop forums
[4:19] <vurtual> so now it's annoying me because it's two different threads
[4:19] <Nyutan> *invisible*
[4:20] * vurtual sprays paint on Nyutan
[4:20] <vurtual> ...
[4:20] * Nyutan is colorful
[4:20] <vurtual> I want to try that in HL2
[4:20] <Zode> "whats that flying paint?"
[4:20] <vurtual> make invisible NPCs, then have a game of finding them by throwing paint buckets
[4:20] <Zode> ***also gmod10 ftw***
[4:20] <vurtual> Someone go and make me a tiny paint bucket model

[5:07] <Perry> Oh, auto command
[5:07] <Azrael-> yeah
[5:07] <Azrael-> or i think

[5:07] <Azrael-> just putting the Password in on the server settings also works
[5:07] <Azrael-> CyborgDragon: it's nicer if the client does it for you
[5:07] <CyborgDragon> no i mean, the shorter command will work too -.-

[6:01] <FNugget> and after a few times rebuilding parts of a circut, i looked in my inventory and had 3
[6:02] <FNugget> one of the title screen messages = "absolutely dragon free"

[6:03] <Shadaez> borher
[6:03] <Shadaez> brother
[6:03] <Shadaez> wtf was that
[6:03] <Annihilator> wat
[6:03] <Shadaez> anyways, he always hated on BF:BC2, but he got it today and loves it:\
[6:03] <Azrael-> FNugget: not for long :)
[6:03] <Shadaez> he used to play MW2 all day though
[6:03] <Azrael-> everybody knows that dragons will be the next secret friday update
[6:04] <vurtual> and they will be friendly
[6:04] <vurtual> and fight mobs
[6:05] <vurtual> I wonder if we can make a sun reactor
[6:05] <vurtual> like, a reactor, that's like most other steam-turbine ones
[6:05] <vurtual> but is heated by the sun
[6:05] <vurtual> as a station floating inside it
[6:05] <vurtual> or uses local convection currents for power
[6:06] <CyborgDragon> fnugget, the dragon free thing may or may not be a joke
[6:06] <Konogan> Minecraft is medieval (kindof) not steampunk :P
[6:06] <CyborgDragon> on notch's latest video, the flyover of an alpha map, in the description it says dragon lairs as one of the possible new features
[6:06] <Annihilator> i like steampunk too
[6:06] <Azrael-> Steampunk is nice.
[6:07] <CyborgDragon> also, konogon has said that he likes to think of minecraft as medieval steampunk
[6:07] <Annihilator> notch is a dnd person
[6:07] <vurtual> Konogan, what cars do you use?
[6:07] <CyborgDragon> as in, no overly steampunkish stuff

[6:07] <Konogan> I had a yellow sabre with a black strip.
[6:07] <Cial> you cant over steam punk
[6:08] <Konogan> I loved that one.
[6:08] <vurtual> until recently, I was burning through cars fast
[6:08] <Perry> That gregory paull guy who always comments on notch's blog entries hurts me.
[6:08] <Konogan> And... mmmh... can't remember the name of the other one.
[6:08] <Shrub> tiny minecart tracks + hulking steamship = feels wrong
[6:08] <vurtual> I had roman's taxi for a while, until I left that behind to get... another one of that.
[6:08] <vurtual> Wrecked that somehow
[6:08] <vurtual> then wrecked the other
[6:08] <vurtual> ended up losing at least one by rolling it
[6:09] <vurtual> then I had some chavos for a while, which was stalking me
[6:09] <vurtual> and it eventually vanished, into the winds
[6:09] <vurtual> then my last one was some blue muscley car, which eventually vanished after a mission
[6:09] <vurtual> now I have two muscley cars
[6:09] <Perry> Konogan: I think the striped cars are banshees
[6:09] <vurtual> there's multiple cars that have stripes
[6:09] <Konogan> Vurtual, you know the first guy you pursue in car? he got a black one with golden trim or something like that. I like that one too. :D

[6:11] <Konogan> The one you said looked like Delorean's.

[6:11] <vurtual> I did find that style once, used it to(tauntingly) make an aewsome bond movie jump
[6:11] <vurtual> eventually had someone else do the jump in a supercar to push me upright
[6:11] <vurtual> we both rolled over when driving off the building we were on
[6:11] <vurtual> and our cars vanished
[6:11] <Konogan> Oh yeah, anyway. I don't know why but I love that car!

[6:12] <vurtual> ruiner.
[6:12] <vurtual> The only other car in the game with a t-top is the faction
[6:12] <vurtual> and instead of having the nice smooth semi-hidden headlight front, it had the front businessy type
[6:13] <Konogan> I really don't know why I love it that much, It's just so fun to drive.

[8:28] <Eidolon> Dez, Creepers are ea-- Yeah.
[8:28] <LordA> and you have about 10 blocks to back up

[9:02] <Conundrumer> what program is that?
[9:02] <Wervyn> It uses more gates than the merge sort method, but it's much more amenable to minecraft because it's entirely NORs or long chains of ORs (just draw a long line of wire), and involves no wire crossing.

[9:10] <bildramer> :O
[9:10] <Wervyn> There are approximately 20 cascading NOR gates that need to be cleared in the circuit.
[9:10] <bildramer> we do need that
[9:10] <Wervyn> So the clock needs a cycle at least that long.
[9:10] <Azathoth> poor piggy
[9:10] <Wervyn> Preferably longer, since your circuit also has to feed into the flop and to other cells.

[9:12] <Wervyn> I wanted to do it, but it's impractical, space wise, with the broken physics now.
[9:12] <Conundrumer> the clock had a period of around 5 seconds, but the lag made it terribly slow
[9:12] <Eidolon> Dude.
[9:12] <Eidolon> I was going to say something but I forgot.
[9:12] <Eidolon> OH.
[9:12] <Azathoth> lol

[9:13] <Conundrumer> broken physics?
[9:14] <Wervyn> The torch issue makes things a lot less versatile.
[9:14] <Conundrumer> what exactly is the torch issue?
[9:14] <Wervyn> There's a very compact way to do that grid that you could probably fit into a 10x10x10 cube, if torches provided power to blocks like they used to.

[9:20] <LordA> You can then use it to write a message

[9:23] <LordA> xD
[9:23] <Siiseli> just to piss you off
[9:23] <bildramer> so it wasn't Castlevania after all
[9:23] <bildramer> D:
[9:24] <LordA> No detail?
[9:24] <LordA> For shame.
[9:24] <Wervyn> Er, the outputs. Top output is the survival rule, so AND that with the state. Then OR the result of that with the bottom output, which is the birth rule.
[9:24] <LordA> What would your literary teacher say, if she was around?
[9:24] <Conundrumer> mhm
[9:25] <Wervyn> Basically the idea is, you have lines of power crossing each other. Three horizontally, to represent the number of things you want to count, and eight from the top for each thing to be counted.
[9:25] <Siiseli> LordA, no really there was also lots of studying and other stuff during the holidayu
[9:25] <LordA> Lol
[9:25] <Siiseli> but besides that we just ate, slept and fucked. Best trip ever.
[9:25] <Wervyn> And the idea is they continue in a direction until they collide with each other.
[9:25] <LordA> Back to the basics, eh?
[9:25] <Siiseli> mm
[9:25] <Wervyn> So if all the lines of power collide and nothing is left over, then there are three inputs.
[9:25] <LordA> However, you had lots of sex
[9:25] <LordA> Now you must go to hell, heretic
[9:26] <Wervyn> If there are more than three, power will get to the bottom. Less than three, and power gets to the right edge. So you can use it to count "2 or 3" at the same time.

[9:28] <LordA> I think not!

[9:31] <Conundrumer> so the leftmost gates are not necessary, if constant power is attached to it?

[9:32] * Furyhunter (Furyhunter@cpe-70-112-108-97.austin.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[9:33] <Wervyn> The OR gates on the bottom and right are not, strictly, necessary. You need one break to separate "2 or 3" from "only 3", but the rest can just be a long line of power.
[9:33] <Wervyn> It's just that in circuit design, you can't generally connect two outputs together.

[9:34] <Wervyn> Whereas in Minecraft you can (though you need to be very careful about it).
[9:34] <Conundrumer> wow I actually really understand how this circuit works
[9:35] <Wervyn> Once you understand the concept, yeah. It's pretty straightforward.

[9:38] <Wervyn> I had a stacked concept, where you'd get two inputs from the north, go up a level, two from the south, up a level, two from the north, and so on. The fact that the diagram would have ended up slightly on the diagonal would have allowed it to easily incorporate east and west as well.

[9:39] <Wervyn> This would involve different logic at the end of it though, since not all crossing inputs arrived from the same direction. You'd need a different way to tell if you had 2 or 3.
[9:40] <Wervyn> Hard to describe in words though.

[9:41] <Wervyn> Hopefully not. But that's how I was going to deal with multiple directions.
[9:41] * Varriount is now known as Varsleep
[9:42] <Wervyn> Output comes out the top, wired into a minimal D flop (I had a 6x5x4 design before the change, some others did better I think).
[9:42] <Wervyn> Then spiders out and descends around the border in a spiral.
[9:43] <Wervyn> Having the flop at the top means that wiring manual set/reset into the cell is easier, too.

[9:47] <bildramer> -_-
[9:47] <Wervyn> You should really just quit playing Minecraft now, you realize it's a rather pointless game, right?
[9:47] <bildramer> ok, have you found out how to make a single cell?
[9:47] <Wervyn> Collect materials, build stuff, kill sheep? And for what?
[9:47] <bildramer> with 8 connections and stuff
[9:47] <bildramer> if yes, congrats, Minecraft is Turing-complete
[9:48] <bildramer> almost Turing-complete, map is not infinite
[9:48] <Wervyn> Heh, there are probably much better ways to go about proving turing completeness than building a Life sim.
[9:48] <bildramer> that's an easy one thoguh
[9:48] <Conundrumer> logic gates themselves make mc turing complete, kind of
[9:48] <bildramer> though*
[9:48] <Wervyn> Yes.
[9:48] <Wervyn> Having the logic gates at all is enough.
[9:48] <Conundrumer> oh yes, make a life sim then make logic gates in the life sim
[9:49] <Wervyn> Oh boy.
[9:49] <bildramer> what the fuck Google
[9:49] <bildramer> 1.27 seconds
[9:49] <bildramer> search is getting ridiculously slow
[9:49] <Conundrumer> making a turing complete sim in a turing complete game
[9:49] <Conundrumer> speaking of which, thought about making a turing machine?
[9:49] <Conundrumer> I think others are already attempting to
[9:50] <Wervyn> Hm
[9:50] <bildramer> uh, actually, that could be hard
[9:50] <bildramer> accessing arrays of arbitary size
[9:50] <Wervyn> So, you need a way to represent the tape, which is a bank of memory, really.
[9:50] <Conundrumer> it could be straightforward if one doesn't bother to optimize
[9:50] <bildramer> probably needs n^2 spaxe
[9:50] <bildramer> space*
[9:50] <Wervyn> You need a way to point into it easily, and move left and right.
[9:51] * tophus (tophus@115-64-128-226.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[9:51] <Wervyn> Using a 2D tape, might be interesting...
[9:51] <Wervyn> And then, you need a way to represent states.
[9:51] <Wervyn> And transition rules.
[9:51] <bildramer> ouch
[9:51] <Wervyn> Which is basically another 2D table.
[9:52] <Conundrumer> the rules can be easily done with NAND truth tables, but everything else is kldfjgal;djgf
[9:52] <Wervyn> But that's really it...
[9:52] <bildramer> dsfargeg
[9:52] <Conundrumer> pointing to parts of the tape is not intuitive
[9:53] <Wervyn> If you can get those components, a rules table that says "if you're in state one and read a 1, write 1, move left, go to state two."...
[9:53] <Wervyn> And an array that you can move around in. That's a turing maching.

[11:06] <Monte> minecraft should be a minigame in farmville :/
[11:06] <Pharod42> Because EA's stuff lately has been terrible?
[11:06] <Monte> and they should join ea
[11:06] <Monte> because it would have a lot more devloeprs
[11:06] <Azathoth> not all of it

[11:06] <Rooster> Ahhh spore.
[11:07] <Rooster> It had so much potential
[11:07] <Monte> yes
[11:07] <Riyuzakisan> minecraft shouldn't be in farmville
[11:07] <kaboomarang> Indeed...
[11:07] <Pharod42> Yeah, I still don't get why they didn't just debug the GDC demo.
[11:07] <Monte> yes it should
[11:07] <Monte> stop trolling
[11:07] <Riyuzakisan> minecraft should be a minigame LIKE farmville
[11:07] <mnjiman> "You are all that i need.. something tsomething something.. imagine..
[11:07] <vede> Azathoth, because I wouldn't want to play a game, no matter how fun, developed by a serial rapist. Not saying EA is a bunch of rapists, I'm just saying that I can't make myself respect them (or most large companies) enough to feel comfortable playing their games.

[11:08] <Riyuzakisan> minecraft owns the rest of em
[11:08] <Rooster> I say if the game is fun, it shouldn't matter were it comes from, as long as the price is fair.
[11:08] <Pharod42> It was way back, like 02 or something. First we saw of spore.
[11:08] <Azathoth> that too, rooster
[11:08] <JabJabJab> hey riuzakisan
[11:08] <Rooster> Saw it in 05 or something Pharod42

[11:20] <JabJabJab> I need help with
[11:20] <JabJabJab> Making a map import script using the library of blocks im making
[11:20] <JabJabJab> and need to finish
[11:20] <JabJabJab> and a dynamic lighting lamp made

[11:20] <DEElekgolo> map loading, i dont know about, ive tried that a few times

[11:20] <JabJabJab> This project has a HUUUGE potential
[11:21] <DEElekgolo> it does
[11:21] <JabJabJab> oh it's easy if u know how the map structure works
[11:21] <JabJabJab> the hexs are listed i believe on minepedia
[11:21] <Riyuzakisan> so minecraft machinima as in you just animate their movement?
[11:21] <JabJabJab> and i think the map structure is too
[11:21] <Riyuzakisan> which would be extensive work
[11:22] <JabJabJab> well animating will come too
[11:22] <Riyuzakisan> i guess
[11:22] <Rooster> Minecraft Machinima = fuck yeah
[11:22] <Riyuzakisan> oh
[11:22] <JabJabJab> not with minecraft
[11:22] <Riyuzakisan> cool
[11:22] <DEElekgolo> JabJabJab, it is, but even so, i never wrapped my mind around a good method of loading them
[11:22] <JabJabJab> well
[11:22] <JabJabJab> i showed an example of how to load them
[11:22] <Riyuzakisan> too confused

[11:23] <LanternGhost> Not sure if anyone knows this but just going to ask anyway
[11:23] <vede> I wonder how hard it would be to write a MUD server.
[11:23] <Riyuzakisan> ok
[11:23] <LanternGhost> Is Notch going to finish biomes before multiplayer survival?
[11:23] <Riyuzakisan> perhaps
[11:23] <vede> Almost definitely, LanternGhost.
[11:23] <LanternGhost> Because his newest blog update says last weeks Friday updates was supposed to be biomes finished
[11:23] <Whiskerz1> Hes been working on biomes hasnt he
[11:23] <Whiskerz1> yeah
[11:23] <LanternGhost> Hea
[11:24] <JabJabJab> Deelekgolo blender is open sourced btw
[11:24] <LanternGhost> He was supposed to have it done on Friday
[11:24] <Whiskerz1> im assuming SMP will be a while
[11:24] <LanternGhost> but it took longer then he though
[11:24] <Rooster> Randomly spawning in a desert, tundra, forest = MINEGASM
[11:24] <LanternGhost> His blog says someone time within a month
[11:24] <Riyuzakisan> SMP ~1 month
[11:24] <LanternGhost> I know Rooster
[11:24] <Riyuzakisan> within a month i think he said

[11:24] <LanternGhost> I really want Biomes
[11:24] <Whiskerz1> thats a while in notch time
[11:24] <LanternGhost> my life would be complete
[11:24] <Riyuzakisan> lol
[11:24] <Riyuzakisan> yea notch time
[11:24] <Rooster> I really want horses or boats
[11:24] <Rooster> Some way to travel quickly
[11:24] <Whiskerz1> boats would be awesome for my current map
[11:24] <LanternGhost> "The ???Small friday update??? (which was originally going to be biomes) took up all the coding time I had."
[11:24] <Riyuzakisan> 1 month notch time = ~ 1-2.5 months real world time
[11:24] <Whiskerz1> the ocean is so cool on my map
[11:24] <JabJabJab> So Deelekgolo what are u confuzed about exactly
[11:25] <Whiskerz1> but itll all go to waste when SMP comes out
[11:25] <DEElekgolo> well i know how to load the byte array for block IDS
[11:25] <LanternGhost> Because Biomes are going to be amazing
[11:25] <DEElekgolo> and apply an enum to the hex values and such
[11:25] <Whiskerz1> Does anyone have a good SMP server planned, or know of one?
[11:25] <LanternGhost> I love the atmospheric feel you get when you play on the snow map
[11:25] <DEElekgolo> but its just getting it into an array and to get xyz values out of them
[11:25] <Rooster> Whiskerz1: Zen-Craft
[11:25] <vede> I've been thinking since that demake compo Notch mentioned that a sandboxy (kinda Minecrafty, but made to fit the medium) MUD would be awesome, but all the MUD servers in existence probably wouldn't supply quite what I'm looking for, and are probably way too old to make running them very easy.
[11:25] <JabJabJab> TheOne's will definally apply SMP
[11:25] <JabJabJab> well
[11:25] <JabJabJab> why would we need arrays Dee
[11:26] <Whiskerz1> I feel Wierd when i play with snow, the falling is just...wierd
[11:26] <JabJabJab> well
[11:26] <JabJabJab> i dunno lol
[11:26] <DEElekgolo> wat
[11:26] <LanternGhost> I think I am going to try and make a game
[11:26] <JabJabJab> not to permenantly keep arrays
[11:26] <Whiskerz1> also i just noticed i was whiskerz1

[11:26] <DEElekgolo> well yea
[11:26] <JabJabJab> sorry I dont know much about 3D voxel stuff or w.e.
[11:26] <DEElekgolo> but still, you would want to make cubes at xyz coordinates from the byte array
[11:26] <Rooster> Will it blend? That is the question
[11:26] <LanternGhost> Lol
[11:26] <DEElekgolo> it doesnt have to be a voxel
[11:26] <Riyuzakisan> lol
[11:26] <Rooster> duh duh duuuuuuuuuh duh duh duh duhhhhhhhhhhhh
[11:26] <Riyuzakisan> voxel
[11:27] <JabJabJab> Im speaking stupid here it's 2:30 AM
[11:27] <Riyuzakisan> why not cube
[11:27] <JabJabJab> but still
[11:27] <DEElekgolo> just make a bunch of cubes at xyz values once you find a way to get xyz values from the index
[11:27] <Riyuzakisan> voxel is for volumetrics
[11:27] <vede> And you might also want to make sure you don't have thousands of redundant vertices and faces and crap.
[11:27] <JabJabJab> well
[11:27] <JabJabJab> that wont matter

[11:28] <JabJabJab> yeah
[11:28] <JabJabJab> i just want to be able to delete blocks too
[11:28] <DEElekgolo> but the method i am thinking of will require the map to be statis
[11:28] <JabJabJab> u know
[11:28] <DEElekgolo> static
[11:28] <DEElekgolo> yea i was thinking csg
[11:28] <DEElekgolo> unless you can do realtime- csg
[11:28] <JabJabJab> and deleting blocks + static arrays = ?

[13:02] <Foe> You'll never get them, shit games are not worth their shit rewards
[13:02] <Tukiko> Join the army, fight in a war, and live 50 more years and I'm sure you'll get something
[13:03] <Foe> Something that has more value, but still not enough value to make you feel validated, Shadaez
[13:03] <Foe> Amirite Tukiko?

[13:30] <Tukiko> Indeed
[13:30] <Tukiko> I have a diamond piackaxe so I can mine it :D

[13:31] <nicnax93> lol, i had a chest full of diamonds xD
[13:31] <DDRJake> never the less, you CAN collect and place obsidian
[13:31] <nicnax93> then i blew up ma house and forgot to take them out
[13:31] <DDRJake> if you want an easier way, merge lava spring with water spring
[13:31] <nicnax93> *facepalm to the max*
[13:31] <DDRJake> well, lava spring with water
[13:31] <Foe> lol
[13:32] <Tukiko> I had a lava lake so I poured water all over the place and built a base on top. :D
[13:32] <Foe> you can make infinite obsidian, it is so damn easy
[13:32] <nicnax93> i do that underground
[13:32] <nicnax93> instead of tiringly building paths in lava
[13:32] <DDRJake> easy to do underground where there tends to be a lot of lava spring

[13:33] <nicnax93> suz u cant make infinite lava :/

[13:33] <Foe> and you still get infinite obsidian

[13:35] <DDRJake> only lava spring + water = obsidian
[13:35] <DDRJake> the flow of lava from a lava spring will turn to cobblestone when it comes in contact with water
[13:36] <nicnax93> i tried making an infinite cobble source
[13:36] <nicnax93> but i couldnt get the water current rite ><
[13:36] <DDRJake> and unlike water, lava does not follow the "if next to 2 springs, becoma a spring" logic anymore
[13:37] <DDRJake> the liquid flow logid is absurd at first but the more you play around with it the more you understand it
[13:37] <Foe> DDRJake, spring lava + spring water = obsdian
[13:37] <Foe> not lava spring + water
[13:37] <Foe> that reaction is so crude
[13:37] <Foe> it is wasteful

[16:14] <gdude2002> I knbow
[16:14] <Visiiri> except there's this thing
[16:14] <gdude2002> I was referring to English as a programming language
[16:14] <Visiiri> it's called cultural evolution
[16:14] <gdude2002> which can be true
[16:15] <gdude2002> depending on who you're talking to
[16:15] <gdude2002> :P

[16:15] <Shadaez> bildramer handball is taken :D
[16:15] <gdude2002> :P
[16:15] <Visiiri> I believe that the term actually came from the feild
[16:15] <Uniju> Shadaez: thats ok, its not a ball. handegg
[16:15] <gdude2002> lol feild
[16:15] <bildramer> nonfootball
[16:15] <Visiiri> as, originally, it was 300 feet, not 100 yards
[16:15] <gdude2002> yeah
[16:16] <gdude2002> it was
[16:16] <Shadaez> Uniju what
[16:16] <bildramer> well, in most other languages there's an unified term
[16:16] <gdude2002> Every three feet you have to bounce the ball on the ground
[16:16] <gdude2002> so
[16:16] <Uniju> its shaped like an egg

[16:42] <Shadaez> I would own one, actually, and would make iPhone games

[16:43] <Shadaez> oh
[16:44] <gdude2002> He wants to remove the ones he has.
[16:44] <Shrub> I let my friend use it and he got a bunch of Achievements
[16:44] <gdude2002> :P
[16:44] <Shadaez> all my friends used an achievement unlocker, super dumb
[16:44] <Shrub> and I was like "nuuuuu"
[16:44] <Tukiko> So basically to develop games for the iphone I need to buy a mac and perhaps pay for the library, but to develop games for both the Zune and Windows I just need to buy a much cheaper PC and get the software for free.
[16:44] <Tukiko> err, software = library
[16:44] <Superwafflez> yep
[16:44] <Shrub> and to develop for Amiga you need to go back in time
[16:44] <Tukiko> No wonder I don't have a mac
[16:44] <Tukiko> OH
[16:44] <Tukiko> AND
[16:44] <Tukiko> Do the new macs even have ESATA ports yet?
[16:44] <Superwafflez> no idea
[16:45] <Tukiko> Probably not
[16:45] <Shrub> the new macs even have Steve Mobbs yet?
[16:45] <Superwafflez> never used esata anyway
[16:45] <Tukiko> I do all the time
[16:46] <Superwafflez> if anyone was wondering, I bought the iMac for web surfing, music and to sit there and look good in mt office
[16:46] <Shadaez> the first app I make for android will be some free minecraft-related thing, just for experience :)
[16:46] <Shrub> I have to say
[16:46] <Shrub> Macs DO look good.
[16:46] <Shadaez> Superwafflez with 32 GB RAM?
[16:46] <Superwafflez> yep :)
[16:47] <gdude2002> /facedesk
[16:47] <Shadaez> Superwafflez make an iPhone game and then write off the mac on your taxes! :D

[16:47] <Tukiko> Macs do look good, I'll give them that, but I could probably just buy the casing and make my pc look like a mac. :D

[17:04] <Shrub74> I think if Infdev Maps had Lats and Longs it would be sweet
[17:04] <Shrub74> so you could be all like "Epic cave at 53e 54s"

[17:05] <Shadaez> I can't see how it would
[17:05] <Tukiko> Well there's two things that WON'T WORK.
[17:05] <Shadaez> because the maps are huge and constantly changing in size
[17:05] <Shisno> yes... they mean in multiplayer.
[17:05] <Shisno> and your x and y positions.
[17:05] <Superwafflez> the spawn is the 0,0 origin
[17:05] <Tukiko> Shadaez: Center of first chunk is 0,0 and then add and subtract as necessary

[17:09] <Shisno> and you load each map seperately.
[17:09] <Tukiko> This ^^^
[17:09] <Superwafflez> multiworld servers suck
[17:09] <Shadaez> it is similiar
[17:09] <Superwafflez> break the players up
[17:09] <Shisno> Anyway
[17:09] <shrubbleoseven> Multiworlds are good if there are t3h greiferz
[17:09] <Shisno> im going to go curl up.

[17:11] * Awoken (sindrebj91@88.84.49.132) has joined #minecraft
[17:11] <Tukiko> Because it's two different sets of data
[17:11] <Tukiko> One is bounded and one is not
[17:11] <Shadaez> it all depends on how large of an area the player is sent
[17:11] <Superwafflez> should just send 256 blocks aroudn the players position
[17:11] <Superwafflez> around*
[17:11] <Shadaez> it will only have to send a large peice once, then it will have to stream it only as fast as a player can walk
[17:12] <Superwafflez> seems rather doable to me
[17:12] <Tukiko> Nobody said it wasn't doable
[17:12] <Tukiko> Just that some people have really shitty servers if you haven't noticed.
[17:12] <Shadaez> then I don't see why you'd doubt the ability of having inf MP
[17:12] <Tukiko> I never said I doubted it
[17:12] <Shisno> he doesnt doubt that.
[17:12] <Tukiko> I just said it wasn't official
[17:12] <Shisno> He doubts that ALL of them will be inf.
[17:12] <Superwafflez> people with shit servers wont get any players
[17:13] <Superwafflez> simple as that
[17:13] <Tukiko> They do now, why would that change?
[17:13] <Shrub> I can't wait for awesome servers
[17:13] <Shadaez> that's why there are still going to be limited maps
[17:13] <Shrub> I want a server
[17:13] <Shisno> She, rather, sorry.
[17:13] <Shrub> where if you die in the game
[17:13] <Shrub> you're banned for 24 hours
[17:13] <Zep--> In Alpha I dig a hole a few steps from a water source, then I cut a channel from the water source to the hole, but the water flows in at a down angle and never fills up the hole I dug. Am I doing something wrong?
[17:13] <Tukiko> You die in real life
[17:13] <Superwafflez> if theres an option for inf and limited, everyone will play the inf servers
[17:13] <Tukiko> Zep: Water is retarded
[17:13] <Shisno> zep - finite water.
[17:14] <Shadaez> I know there are at least some people who are going to have a proper server
[17:14] <Tukiko> Doesn't fill anything anymore
[17:14] <Shrub> Gay.
[17:14] <Superwafflez> its gried proof
[17:14] <Superwafflez> grief*
[17:14] <Shrub> That's so fuuuuucked.
[17:14] <Zep--> so I'd have to fill it with a bucket?
[17:14] <Shrub> but it works, I guess
[17:14] <Tukiko> yep
[17:14] <Shrub> If only it would actually even out like real water
[17:14] <Shrub> then it would be acceptable
[17:14] <Tukiko> ^
[17:14] <Shrub> and it might actually even be superior
[17:14] <Zep--> I thought the water flowed correctly in..classic mode?
[17:14] <Tukiko> It didn't flow
[17:14] <Tukiko> It just spread out
[17:14] <Tukiko> XD
[17:15] <Shrub> it just... spread
[17:15] <Shrub> like a virus
[17:15] <Superwafflez> it multiplied like crazy

[18:30] <Monte> http://www.backne.org/images/backne/backne-acne-on-back.jpg
[18:31] <vurtual> so he suggests... building an autobot him
[18:31] <Monte> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[18:31] <vurtual> more and more talking and whatnot
[18:31] <Visiiri> Tukiko: Shove a fucking chainsaw up your vagina
[18:31] <vurtual> then it got boring
[18:31] <Tukiko> Visiiri: You were already in there
[18:31] <ErectWafflez> chainsaw in an axe wound
[18:31] <vurtual> Visiiri is not a chainsaw
[18:31] <ErectWafflez> nothing new

[18:49] <bildramer> "The whole problem comes back to that really misleading name. So, what kind of jerk would come up with the name "Big Bang" if they were a smart enough scientist to know it was more of a "gradual swelling"? Turns out it was one more opposed to the idea of a Big Bang than most. Fred Hoyle was an astrophysicist firmly on the "steady state" side of the great debate of the birth of life, the universe, and everything.
[18:49] <bildramer> He came up with the phrase "Big Bang" as a way to simply explain the viewpoint he disagreed with, intending people to hear the name and think the idea of a giant explosion giving birth to existence was ridiculous. This was a gross misjudgment of human nature.
[18:49] <bildramer> As soon as he suggested there was a huge explosion at the birth of the universe, we latched onto that idea and never let it go. Hoyle simply failed to grasp how profoundly our species loves big-ass explosions."

[19:43] <CyborgDragon> hydrocarbons, aren't they a bitch?
[19:43] <Drury> I already edited apple page on Minepedia :D
[19:44] <CyborgDragon> not happening, xD
[19:44] <CyborgDragon> drury, i dont think it can be crafted
[19:44] <Bodie> CyborgDragon smokes cigarettes with his prostate?
[19:44] <CyborgDragon> unless notch recently implemented the recipe
[19:44] <CyborgDragon> because when i got a normal apple, i tried it with both gold bars and blocks
[19:45] <Shrub> CyborgProstate smokes dragons with his Cigarette
[19:45] <Drury> I already ate one...
[19:45] <Drury> It really does exist
[19:45] <CyborgDragon> im talking about the recipe
[19:46] <Drury> :/
[19:46] <CyborgDragon> when i tried it on the dungeon update day, it didnt work
[19:46] <Drury> I never tried to craft it... I simply found it
[19:46] <CyborgDragon> unless notch added it after that, or you're just throwing around that suggested recipe that turned into a troll recipe
[19:46] <Drury> And, I never said how to craft them
[19:46] <CyborgDragon> "It can be crafted from a regular Apple and 8 Gold blocks surrounding it. "
[19:47] <Drury> Not me
[19:47] <Bodie> dungeon update?
[19:47] <Drury> Probably demki
[19:47] <CyborgDragon> bodie, the update that added dungeons/treasure rooms
[19:47] <Bodie> ah fair enough
[19:47] <DDRJake> diamond still irritates me
[19:48] <DDRJake> it's rare so I gotta make it count
[19:48] <DDRJake> but armour runs out so quickly it's hardly worth it

[19:48] <vurtual> WHICH IS ACTUALLY SPELLED ARMOR
[19:48] <Bodie> armour*
[19:48] <Drury> It covers your skin completely :/
[19:48] <Beardbeard> What do gold apples do?
[19:48] <DDRJake> but there's little need for diamond pickaxe
[19:48] <lenox> kill notch
[19:48] <CyborgDragon> vurt, quit it with the american english
[19:49] <Bodie> they don't exist
[19:49] <Bodie> thats what they do
[19:49] <DDRJake> I go with stone pickaxes because I do tonnes of mining
[19:49] <lenox> you feed one to notch and it kills him
[19:49] <CyborgDragon> Beardbeard, they either heal 8 hearts or 10 hearts
[19:49] <Drury> They do
[19:49] <CyborgDragon> bodie, they do exist, quit trolling -.-
[19:49] <Drury> They completely heal you
[19:49] <Bodie> they don't properly exist
[19:49] <Bodie> in the official game
[19:49] <Drury> :/

[19:49] <Drury> You cannot craft them (probably)
[19:49] <Bodie> first i heard of that
[19:49] <DDRJake> I have never found a dungeon
[19:49] <Bodie> why have apples but not apple trees?
[19:49] <Bodie> :(
[19:49] <CyborgDragon> are we sure it's full heal and not 8 hearts?
[19:49] <Piecat> @seen notch
[19:49] <Drury> I never heard about golden apples... I found them myself
[19:50] <Drury> Well, I had 0.5 hearts and it healed me

[20:09] <lenox> VPS servers rarely require visual type stuff
[20:09] <lenox> minecraft server doesn't either, actually :P
[20:09] <bildramer> ugh
[20:09] <lenox> why would you need opengl on the server
[20:09] <bildramer> it's 128 meters in total
[20:09] <chimp> it requires opengl to at least let you run minecraft
[20:09] <lenox> no.

[20:12] <bildramer> I should install one in the more stable comp

[20:42] <Learner> Its not common.
[20:42] <Learner> It just comes in large amounts per brick
[20:42] <Drury> I have about 5 stacks of it
[20:42] <lighthazard> What does it do?
[20:42] <Drury> And crapload of it unmined

[20:43] <lenox> shit
[20:43] <lenox> 5 stacks of diamond? yumm
[20:43] <Learner> Notch mentioned logic gates.
[20:43] <Learner> Thats not bad at all
[20:43] <Drury> I just ignore redstone now, it's too common and takes too much time to mine
[20:43] <Kiyako> does parallel intersect or not?
[20:43] <Learner> Gold. Now thats rare
[20:43] <DDRJake> anduseless
[20:44] <Drury> Gold is as rare as diamond... A bit more common

[20:45] <Drury> Wood picks are stupid...
[20:45] <Drury> I use them to mine cobble
[20:45] <Helar> wood picks are only for stone
[20:45] <Kokopure> I use a wood pick for about two seconds in the beginning of the game
[20:45] <SireTRM> And coal.
[20:45] <Learner> I use cobblestone picks the first time my wooden picks wears off
[20:45] <SireTRM> Wood can be used to mine coal.
[20:45] <Kokopure> after I get three cobbles, I throw my wooden pick into the ocean
[20:45] <Kokopure> because I hate it
[20:45] <Learner> well true
[20:46] <Drury> It is possible to deconstruct iron ore block with wooden pick, but you'll get nothing
[20:46] <Learner> its not really that
[20:46] <Learner> you don't get a speed bonus with a wooden pick
[20:46] <Drury> I use diamond pick :/
[20:46] <Learner> Hmm I... just forgot something
[20:46] <Learner> What kind of pick do you need to mine gold?
[20:46] <DDRJake> iron
[20:46] <Drury> Iron
[20:46] <SireTRM> Iron
[20:46] <Learner> hmm
[20:47] <Learner> thats really good then

[20:48] <Drury> Obsidian is kickass

[21:06] <Anime-Junkie> I agree
[21:06] <Learner> A simple example would be a small raft.

[21:06] <Drury> There is some modular ships thread on forums

[21:08] <Drury> I think it would be awesome if you could be on one ship with your friends
[21:08] <Learner> Your boat could have spikes or wedges that allow your boat to split the ice and let you sail through it.
[21:08] <Anime-Junkie> actually
[21:08] <Anime-Junkie> What would be good this this:
[21:08] <Learner> Well I think that larger ships could hold more people.
[21:08] <Drury> +Airships :D
[21:09] <SireTRM> A clan sailing the frozen seas, searching for the rare materials required to expand their power?
[21:09] <Learner> In real life, the boats that cut the ice have a giant wedge on the front.
[21:09] <Learner> Airships?
[21:09] <Drury> Yep
[21:09] <Learner> that would require fuel I assume
[21:09] <Anime-Junkie> Basic small craft like rafts, canoes and skiffs, then there are hulls.
[21:09] <Anime-Junkie> Hulls are large and require a lot of wood. But you can place blocks on them
[21:09] <Learner> Hmm... motors
[21:09] <Anime-Junkie> yeah
[21:09] <Drury> Awesome idea O.o
[21:09] <Drury> HULLS!
[21:09] <Learner> that could be a good idea

[21:12] <Anime-Junkie> Ladders are fine

[21:14] <Anime-Junkie> Yeah I agree with learner

[21:15] <Learner> we can number minecarts.
[21:15] <Drury> Pigs are uncontrolable - is it good?
[21:15] <Learner> when a certain number goes through a gate then the track switches
[21:15] <Drury> Minecarts are already uncotrolable, is it good?
[21:16] <Drury> I don't think so
[21:16] <Learner> this way... when you have 3 tracks of carts merging onto the same track for pickup, this will allow them to go back the same way they came.

[21:19] <Learner> the 3 carts are numbered 1, 2, and 3. When either one is heading to the surface to have their inventory emptied, the gate will point them to the pickup zone.
[21:20] <geraldbrent> what is the best irc client
[21:20] <Drury> Wait, Notch already said "No automatic minecarts"
[21:20] <vurtual> so guys
[21:20] <Learner> However, when either one is returning to the mining zone, the gate scanner will check the cart numbers.
[21:20] <vurtual> guess what just happened

[21:52] <Vicrry> I haven't seen any of the mutant animals running around in it
[21:53] <lenox> it loses a lot of charm compared to 3
[21:53] <lenox> 3 was more fun to screw around in

[21:53] <bildramer> ^
[21:53] <Kokopure> and RDR has... horses.
[21:53] <fatcuint> I think red dead redemption is good beacuse it horse instead of motor vehicle.
[21:53] <Vicrry> JC2 would be funner if screwing around wasn't "OMGZ PLAY WITH GRAPPLING HOOK DOOHIKEY!" all the time.
[21:53] <bildramer> ouch
[21:53] <Helar> RDR fails because it is not for pc
[21:54] <bildramer> why does this cut hurt just when the bleeding stops? :/
[21:54] <fatcuint> I like vice city because of roller blade girl.
[21:54] <Vicrry> Cause the grappling hook doohickey is quite lame and boring :P
[21:54] <lenox> has anyone tried sa:mp ?

[21:54] <Helar> played it for a year
[21:54] <Vicrry> sa:mp?

[21:54] <lenox> san andreas multiplayer
[21:54] <Vicrry> oh
[21:54] <Vicrry> No
[21:55] <Vicrry> San Andreas was funs, but I wouldn't expect multi to be too much funs :P
[21:55] <fatcuint> Can someone tell me if minecraft is an Iphone app, game ect? Thank
[21:55] <Vicrry> Minecraft is a pc game with limited support for Linux/Mac
[21:56] <Merciless> Viccry, it has multi soon
[21:56] <Merciless> jc2 that is
[21:56] <Helar> multi was fun because of rpish servers
[21:56] <fatcuint> Ah, is it MMORPG?
[21:56] <Vicrry> as in, I dunno if it works on Linux/Mac, but I've heard of people doing it that way
[21:56] <Vicrry> Not MMO
[21:56] <fatcuint> What then, reason I ask is I come across this channel randomly.
[21:56] <Vicrry> Multiplayer is planned, but is mostly single for now
[21:57] <Vicrry> How I'd describe Minecraft is this:

[22:02] <Helar> haxx?
[22:02] <Vicrry> :(
[22:02] <C418> as far as I know
[22:02] <Foshie> Make a own converter? :P
[22:02] <C418> notch is very hard at work on multiplayer
[22:02] <C418> right now...
[22:02] <Vicrry> yep
[22:02] <bildramer> people are too lazy to write code to make new chunks
[22:02] <bildramer> :/
[22:02] <Helar> cant you just copy the map with editors?
[22:03] <Vicrry> I would expect the converter to come from community actually :)
[22:03] <bildramer> ...yes
[22:03] <Vicrry> but m3h
[22:03] <lenox> the format is a moving target right now
[22:03] <Foshie> Most of the community are just gamers and not coders .. i would guess
[22:03] <lenox> maybe it'll actually finalize one day
[22:03] <bildramer> I have a single-chunk editor
[22:03] <lenox> it's not hard to deal with it
[22:03] <lenox> it's pretty simple currently, which is why i think it'll change a lot near 1.0
[22:03] <bildramer> I'll fix up the source and release, I think
[22:03] <CyborgDragon> BLARGH
[22:03] <Vicrry> Gonna go play something else - maybe dig more in indev but dunno :P

[22:33] <Drury> It was ment to be infiniminer clone
[22:33] <Drury> but it isnt
[22:33] <Marzanna> MD has more blocks and diffrent gameplay
[22:34] <Helar> MC is nothing like Infiniminer
[22:34] <Snowman> Notch didn't copy IM, he only copied the concept of blocks
[22:34] <Marzanna> Helar, o rly?
[22:34] <Snowman> MD copied the entire MC
[22:34] <Drury> Marzanna, you're trying to say that MC and MD are totally different? O.o
[22:34] <Helar> have you even played infiniminer, marzanna?
[22:34] <Marzanna> MD copied the concept MC
[22:34] <SireTRM> Magnets.
[22:34] <Rooster> Notch copied Infirmer more elegantly.
[22:34] <Marzanna> Helar yes :)
[22:34] <Drury> No, MD copied every idea of MC
[22:34] <Kizzycocoa> what's MD? if I may ask?

[22:35] <Drury> Notch said that it's ok when someone makes MC clones...
[22:35] <Snowman> A clone would be fine
[22:35] <Marzanna> well yeah, cloning ideas is a good thing :)
[22:35] <Drury> Until someone copy the whole concept and starts selling it. That's why is MD free
[22:35] <exe-> md is going to be like diablo. its going to be some kind of rpg maker, with levels made by mc-like playing with blocks
[22:35] <Snowman> But not something that's just a copy of it
[22:36] <Helar> it sucks that you dont have to buy MC in order to play infdev...
[22:36] <Snowman> Drury, both that, and because nobody would buy that horrid thing
[22:36] <Helar> stupid piracy
[22:36] <vurtual> So
[22:36] <Marzanna> Snowman... MD is public domain... No one wants to sell it or copy infdev
[22:37] <Snowman> Nobody would want to buy it either

[22:38] <Marzanna> LinuxPoser, delete temp files and backup saves
[22:38] <Helar> i saw tracks but no vehicles??
[22:38] <Drury> I guess if there will be any MD if I went back in time and killed Notch
[22:38] <LinuxPoser> it should be a fresh install

[23:41] <bildramer> wait, it's 6 in 3D D:
[23:42] <NMLittle> I did try that when I built an underwater house since you can't put a torch on glass.

[23:49] <bildramer> it WILL crash the game
[23:49] <vurtual> why are we choosing between the different nintenmons, keiya?
[23:49] <bildramer> fffffffffffuck
[23:49] <Gunmage> You will be sitting there, minding your own business
[23:49] <Gunmage> And then, half the map will disappear because of a TNT raid
[23:49] <bildramer> lol
[23:49] <bildramer> half the map is ridiculously large

[23:50] <Vicrry> You has a base. Someone found hollows in your walls/stuffs. Now you DON'T has a base but you do has a prettier hole in da floor :P
[23:51] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[23:51] <vurtual> and you take no damage
[23:52] <Vicrry> is it just me, or is the 'public to-do list' on the minecraft page useless cause it not been updated in forever?
[23:52] <vurtual> but all the roads around you are destroyed, leaving only a heavily damaged support, holding up a perfect circle of ground around you
[23:53] <Gunmage> Yeah, its useless.
