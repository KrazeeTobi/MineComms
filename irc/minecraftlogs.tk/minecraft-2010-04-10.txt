[0:00] <Quatroking> okay what the fuck
[0:00] <Quatroking> my SD reader aint working
[0:00] <vurtual> You know what, I sorta want to go to some populated area full of kids violently smashing windows and in general just causing chaos every day, stealing, and such.(lots of places like that in britian apparently)
[0:00] <vurtual> Get a machine gun(actual machine gun, not talking rifles here)
[0:00] <vurtual> and then let loose bursts of rounds at their feet
[0:00] <Azathoth> i really liked the radial menu inside the planet that i had before, but it won't fit if there are more than 5 options and i don't really want to scale them
[0:00] <Nuky> No idea, Aza.
[0:00] <Nuky> I'd have to see it in action, I think

[0:01] <Azathoth> vurtual, louisiana :D
[0:01] <vurtual> No seriously maybe get an armored car, slap a turret on top, and get someone to drive while we chase down criminals.

[0:01] <Azathoth> or atlanta, detroit, houston, etc
[0:01] <vurtual> nah
[0:02] <vurtual> It has to be a severely gun-controlled area
[0:02] <Azathoth> in action, nuky? the menu isn't animated or anything if that's what you mean
[0:02] <vurtual> so that this is unexpected
[0:02] <Nuky> Okay.
[0:02] * Dandistine (biocon8600@136.176.103.142) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:02] <mr_sticky> vurtual how about south africa?
[0:02] <Nuky> Well, it looks fine, I suppose =)
[0:02] <Azathoth> the orange icon just shows the current selection, and the text is displayed at the center of the planet
[0:02] <vurtual> no it has to be like, britian
[0:02] <vurtual> infact britian in specific

[0:03] <Azathoth> maybe i'll move the caption above the menu on the task bar thing at the top
[0:03] <vurtual> Also, keep a bucket of smoke grenades filled with some sort of annoying irritating gas, nothing too powerful but would be enough to annoy people, and an M79, then when criminals hide, smoke them out.
[0:03] <vurtual> Like bees.
[0:03] <vurtual> Puny, squishy human bees.
[0:03] <Azathoth> vurtual you're so weird
[0:03] <vurtual> Why yes I am.
[0:04] <vurtual> My idea of fun is fighting unorganized massive crime with armored cars and machine guns, how is this not weird?
[0:04] <vurtual> And also how is it not awesome?
[0:04] <Ten_Tacles> Building without hacks in creative mode is like playing with legos using only your feet.
[0:04] <Ten_Tacles> Ecrider is a fucking asshole.
[0:04] <vurtual> Ten_Tacles no, with your hands
[0:04] <Ten_Tacles> Yeah
[0:04] <vurtual> with hacks is also your feet
[0:04] <vurtual> you don't have to climb up your own structure.
[0:04] <Ten_Tacles> Building with hacks is like ordering fully build lego.
[0:05] <vurtual> no it's like standing up
[0:05] <Ten_Tacles> Hm
[0:05] <vurtual> when the lego competition is for lying down/on knees only
[0:05] <Ten_Tacles> I liked building lego while sitting :D
[0:05] <Ten_Tacles> Yeah
[0:05] <Ten_Tacles> Hacks suck.
[0:05] <Ten_Tacles> Nuky and Nuky_ ?

[0:06] <Ten_Tacles> No
[0:06] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[0:06] <vurtual> Also for massive shock and awe, get like, lots of people to do tihs.
[0:06] <vurtual> Who are also master cosplayers and can make a kevlar-filled futuristic space armor costumes
[0:07] <vurtual> Then outfit them with radios, maybe screens, built in to the helmet.
[0:07] <Ten_Tacles> What
[0:07] <vurtual> Any time you talk loudly it will translate your words into random garbled computerized screeching.
[0:07] <vurtual> I can garuntee you there would be no crime in that area for years.
[0:07] <Miclee> Using hacks is like playing a game how you want.
[0:07] <vurtual> Miclee it's like hacking in pokemon with the levels you want
[0:08] * polabears (Mibbit@c-67-167-173-86.hsd1.tn.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft

[0:09] <Dysgalt> kevlar can be shrunk down alot you know
[0:09] <Dysgalt> but i much rather prefer soaking my t-shirt in black boron
[0:09] <Dysgalt> then cooking it at 1000celcius

[0:11] <Ten_Tacles> But my fucking dwarves like to bug around.

[0:20] <alka> wait, what grade are you in?
[0:20] <alka> class whatever
[0:21] <Azathoth> it's titled "observation of einstein-podolsky-rosen entanglement on supraquantum structures by induction through nonlinear transuranic crystal of extremely long wavelength (elw) pulse from mode-locked source array"
[0:21] * Iguana is now known as Iguana|Meh
[0:21] <Overlord> BS
[0:21] <Azathoth> i'm getting my phd in theoretical physics at MIT right now

[0:22] <Snowman> :3
[0:22] <alka> da fuck bitch? no seriously "observation of einstein-podolsky-rosen entanglement on supraquantum structures by induction through nonlinear transuranic crystal of extremely long wavelength (elw) pulse from mode-locked source array" DA FUCK!!!???
[0:22] <Azathoth> :3
[0:22] <Overlord> Gordon freeman was in Metaphysics
[0:22] <Azathoth> nope

[0:22] <Azathoth> theoretical physics
[0:22] <Overlord> Yes he was
[0:22] <alka> t is an user?
[0:22] <Snowman> He has an MIT theoretical physics PhD
[0:23] <Varriount> Azathoth, your title is too boring... Name it "effects of players and levels of fun on minecraft"
[0:23] <Snowman> And he did the same thesis
[0:23] <Slothic> www.livestream.com/slothic Tune in to watch infdev play =)

[0:26] <Snowman> There are none
[0:26] <alka> lol
[0:26] <Azathoth> why would you want to take an entire class on that?
[0:26] <Snowman> No pretty ones though.
[0:26] <Azathoth> it should be "the kitchen"
[0:26] <Aurailen> I think thats kind of sexist.
[0:26] <alka> perverts
[0:26] <Snowman> Aurailen, welcome to the internet.
[0:26] <Azathoth> lol
[0:26] <vurtual> I'm stuck in some half-bored state.

[0:28] <Azathoth> i kinda want to take a quantum physics course
[0:28] <vurtual> So I keep imagining some kind of coop goldeneye with lots of vehicles and stuff.
[0:28] <Snowman> Do you even understand quantum physics?
[0:28] <alka> Azaroth: dont
[0:29] <Azathoth> nope, that's why i wnat to take it :D
[0:29] <Snowman> I understand quantum physics but not 4D :/
[0:29] <Azathoth> but it has like 3 classes as prerequisites that i haven't taken yet D:
[0:29] <vurtual> pfft
[0:29] <vurtual> 5d
[0:29] <Azathoth> and probably won't take
[0:29] <Snowman> Lol, silly Americans
[0:29] <alka> this stuff you are talking about hurts meh brains, lets change topic
[0:30] <Snowman> We haven't even started talking about quantum physics
[0:30] <Snowman> Let's discuss quantum thermodynamics
[0:30] <Azathoth> i'm only in electromagnetism and optics now
[0:30] <vurtual> so guys I got a new shotgun a while back.
[0:30] <alka> i quit
[0:30] <vurtual> I'm a good shot still.
[0:30] * alka quits.

[0:31] <Snowman> The school you go to from like 12 to 18
[0:31] <vurtual> not 12
[0:31] <Azathoth> my high school physics course contained a little bit of optics but it was mostly ... mechanical?

[0:31] <vurtual> even then there's still middleschool
[0:31] <Snowman> In my country it is/was idk if it still is 12
[0:32] <Azathoth> high school here is like 14-18
[0:32] <vurtual> So guys I had some awesome idea for a game.
[0:32] <Azathoth> same thing basically
[0:32] <vurtual> Or just a CIV IV mod. Locked in one era, only victory is conquest.
[0:32] <Snowman> optics as in simple stuff like 1/f=1/v+1/b?

[0:35] <Malikat> alka
[0:35] <Malikat> ROFL

[0:36] <Snowman> Fun Fact: Did you know the abbreviation of The Final Countdown is the same as the one of Team Fortress Classic?
[0:36] <Malikat> it's funny because EA would rathter spend thousands of dollars doing that stunt
[0:36] <Malikat> than say "well, shit. whoops"
[0:36] <Azathoth> rofl. wtf
[0:36] <Malikat> admittedly, it's a little bit funny the way they did it

[0:37] <Malikat> manner
[0:38] <Azathoth> the funny thing is, it probably actually was a glitch
[0:38] <alka> lol, one of the comments : "He can stand on water but he cant hide cheating from??? his wife! "
[0:39] <alka> the next comment: " I Have Also??? Slept With Tiger Woods.."

[0:48] <Malikat> it's like saying that marriage should only be for those who are sexually compatible
[0:48] <Azathoth> doesn't the bible tell these people to be nice to each other or something?
[0:48] <Malikat> rofl
[0:48] <Azathoth> seriously
[0:49] <Azathoth> i thought it was supposed to teach kindness and love for all of your brothers or whatever
[0:49] <Malikat> the same book that they use for the "god hates gays" lines is also the book that tells them to stone and otherwise outcast anyone with a defect, like the need for glasses
[0:49] <Azathoth> except not if your brothers are fags, apparently

[0:54] <TrueWolves> You know
[0:55] <kholhaus> I know?
[0:55] <copyboy> take that back
[0:55] <TrueWolves> We are lucky Notch doesn't troll the hell out of us and accualy contributes further to his game.
[0:55] <Azathoth> why does a transformer require alternating voltage?
[0:55] <vurtual> So I could have an RPK and fight insurgents from atop a BTR then pick off people with an AKM while surfing a car
[0:55] <copyboy> or else ...
[0:55] <kholhaus> Copyboy, it's true.
[0:55] <TrueWolves> What with all the people yellin at em to work. ~.^
[0:55] <kholhaus> You're demanding the maximum while he's already outputting maximum
[0:55] <Marach> yeah, he isnt even here
[0:55] <kholhaus> If that's not being a whiny little kid, I dunno what is.
[0:55] <Azathoth> is the answer: alternating voltage leads to electromagnetic induction which is necessary for the transformer to work?
[0:56] <Demki> LIAR!
[0:56] <Malikat> Azathoth: yes.

[2:12] <Drewseph> it would be awesome to find one
[2:12] <Seiseki2> giants will probably be one specific mob
[2:12] <Drewseph> suddenly its like a time bomb escape sequence
[2:12] <Seiseki2> creepers in different sizes would be nice tho
[2:12] <Seiseki2> but not giant creepers..
[2:13] <Seiseki2> I think giants will probably be real giants, titans or something like that
[2:13] <Ten_Tacles> Giant Creepers.
[2:13] <Drewseph> I'd like a creeper which forces the player to evacuate the area at leaste a 50 m radius
[2:13] <Seiseki2> I want baby creepers
[2:13] <Ten_Tacles> They don't search. They explode!

[2:17] <vurtual> also dealing random damage on the outside of the radius.

[3:01] <Icenisse> uhm
[3:01] <Icenisse> wat
[3:01] <vurtual> or even worse, fails to find a way to spread, since any effective means back wherever it was made are entirely useless due to everybody doing everything different.

[3:13] <vurtual> but why lord of the rings online? They aren't even waving around anything special this time.

[3:14] <vurtual> except if you hack a bow in

[3:25] <Cerus> EVE irritates me. I consider it an abomination of a space sim.
[3:25] <Cerus> Even if it's a wonderful economic simulation.
[3:25] <vurtual> yet they all fail to be played, because UO is dead now, WoW demanding my every bit of personal info, EVE because the fighter pilot part of me complains, and D&D Online because... uhm...
[3:25] <vurtual> it failed its saving roll?
[3:25] <Cerus> min/max for luck.
[3:26] <vurtual> At the same time every time I hear of these games, a tiny bit is stuck with me.
[3:26] <vurtual> and then it just irritates my mind with more and more ideas, like poison ivy of creativity.
[3:26] * Bomb_Spammer is now known as Bomb_Spammer|supper
[3:28] <Aeomin> has anyone figure out infdev's map format?
[3:29] <Cerus> So does anyone else create a temple at their spawn point in infdev?
[3:29] <vurtual> I think that one dude did, but he died of XTREME weed overdose.
[3:29] <Cerus> Just seems appropriate.
[3:29] <Cerus> Perhaps a graveyard would make more sense.
[3:29] <vurtual> Does this count as a temple? http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/5052/colosseum3.png
[3:29] <vurtual> not infdev but it was my spawn
[3:30] <vurtual> almost DID do it as an infdev spawn too, if it wasn't for those meddling cliffs

[3:33] <Rooster> Indeed
[3:33] <vede> Basically, they think, "Oh, things are bad now, so obviously they must have been better before."

[3:35] <outsomnia> Robots with phd's, yep.
[3:35] <vurtual> Sure, there's more education going around.
[3:35] <vurtual> But there's the occasional person who are dumber than a flowchart now, you can't deny that
[3:36] <vede> vurtual, so you think that hundreds of years ago, people were much smarter than people now?
[3:36] <AndrewPH> "students doing worse on ____ test"

[3:42] <vede> vurtual, even the stupid people today are smarter than the stupid people from a hundred years ago.
[3:42] <vurtual> I knew a guy, really nice, who was bad at learning a bit.
[3:43] <Cial> yes but by that logic vede in 100 years you will be one of the stupid ones
[3:43] <vurtual> basically a massive troll you might have known, was his friend. He pretty much did everything he could to cause chaos for anyone who wasn't from his country. I'd call him a nazi but that'd be a compliment.
[3:43] <vurtual> cial, old age.
[3:43] <Cial> im not factoring in age here
[3:43] <vurtual> Even if we can massively enhance intelligence there's the chance that it works way better on kids.
[3:43] <vede> Cial, would it be a bad thing if the people from today would be called stupid by the people living a hundred years from now?
[3:43] <Cial> it wouldnt be im just saying
[3:43] <vede> All that means is that global intelligence is increasing. Which is A Good Thing.
[3:43] <vurtual> WELL BACK IN MY DAY WE DIDN'T HAVE STUPID PEOPLE NOWHERE NEAR AS BAD AS THIS

[3:44] <vurtual> I'm serious about the whole "doing something very dangerous, hurting oneself, then just doing it again." thing though.
[3:44] <outsomnia> At least in most areas.
[3:44] <Cial> but there would still be trolls
[3:44] <vurtual> Actually you know, back in like the 1400s, there was a high speed wi-fi access in the planet for 2 hours
[3:45] <vede> vurtual, but you think this is the first era in history when those people existed?

[3:46] <vede> But vurtual, you're still not doing that great a job of trying to say that global intelligence is decreasing.
[3:46] <vurtual> ...
[3:46] <vurtual> I've never been saying that vede.
[3:47] <vede> So what the hell are you trying to say?
[3:47] <vurtual> maybe my whole "half-agree, but on the other hand" thing is just too confusing for people of this era.
[3:47] <vede> Have we been in agreement for this entire argument?
[3:47] <outsomnia> That 5card poker is much better than texas holdem.
[3:47] <vurtual> like 75% agreement
[3:47] <vede> vurtual, global intelligence is increasing. That's my stance.
[3:47] <outsomnia> 25% goes far in proper debates.
[3:47] * Nesral (root@50A2FE66.flatrate.dk) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[3:48] <outsomnia> Err *is still a significant difference.
[3:48] <Dysgalt> Vede this irc channel proves otherwise

[3:48] <outsomnia> "irc channel" "representative of humanity as a whole"
[3:48] <vurtual> my stance: everybody's smarter generally, but there's some dumb people who are setting world records on dumbness
[3:48] <outsomnia> Yeah I have no objections ehre.
[3:48] <vurtual> IRC can repressent the entirety of humanity if you were to look at every last network.
[3:48] <vede> Also Dysgalt: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifolium_pratense That's the plant I was looking for. Also called red clover. :)
[3:48] <outsomnia> Intelligence goes by the bell-curve by the way.
[3:49] <vurtual> like seriously some of those networks
[3:49] <vurtual> it was like being raped through ethernet cables

[4:34] <TrueWolves> to create water statues*
[4:34] <TrueWolves> huh, it cut my ending a bit there, not 100% sure what I typed. XD

[4:50] <EmpiresBane> microsoft is a living example of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing
[4:51] <EmpiresBane> some years back, they released an update that kept you from connecting to the internet

[4:54] <EmpiresBane> what happens for everyone?

[4:54] <vurtual> and linux!

[5:25] <chibifs> and windows 7 was like :3
[5:25] <vurtual> I have ubuntu on this laptop, older computer ran xp
[5:26] <vurtual> win vista on my gaming pc because 7 is freakishly ugly
[5:26] <chibifs> ... what?
[5:26] <chibifs> It looks exactly the same as vista, except the task bar is actually useful.
[5:26] <vurtual> that taskbar gives me nightmares
[5:27] <jayther> well, that's the first "vista is better than 7" statement i've seen/heard
[5:27] <vurtual> I have to help someone with a win 7 computer and for the most part, I have to give up.
[5:27] <vurtual> Sure it may have a bunch of snazzy new features that may be useful for some people
[5:27] <EmpiresBane> does it continue to stack up messages saying that you have pluggend in or unplugged your headphones?
[5:27] <jayther> i have yet to fool around with 7, but i dont like vista, period. x]

[5:28] <EmpiresBane> i would know. i'm using it right now
[5:28] <vurtual> vista's had a few bluescreens at FIRST, when I got it, when it was really new.
[5:28] <chibifs> vurtual, that has nothing to do with it. it's a kernel level rewrite that actually runs speedy on a variety of hardware, quite the opposite of vista and ubuntu.

[5:29] <chibifs> It also lets 64 bit and 32 bit software coexist peacefully without any issues.
[5:29] <EmpiresBane> the one thing i do like about vista is i'll never have to wonder, "will i have to use some workaround to play this?"
[5:29] <chibifs> Don't even tell me you've had good experience with 64 bit linux.
[5:29] <EmpiresBane> i can just assume yes
[5:29] <AndrewPH> chibifs, I have
[5:29] <vurtual> I'm running a laptop with 64-bit ubuntu and 64-bit vista
[5:29] <AndrewPH> I found it quite nice to be honest :3
[5:30] <chibifs> Don't get me wrong. I love linux.
[5:30] <vurtual> Vista's mostly worked fine and 64-bit ubuntu's had surprisingly little problems sometimes.
[5:30] <chibifs> But everything gtk related has been going in the wrong direction of bloating it up, and everything qt related has been going SHINY MAC WE CAN DO IT TOO
[5:31] <vurtual> Except actually starting vista on here would rape the computer since it's pretty low-spec, so maybe I just have one magical vista install
[5:31] <vurtual> maybe I'm some sort of wizard that almost never has problems
[5:31] * Cial (chatzilla@209-42-180-127.wispnet.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:31] <chibifs> The only way I can stand to run linux anymore is in console with curses apps
[5:31] <TestDummy> ^
[5:31] <vurtual> maybe an Elbereth.txt on your C:/ drive with "Elbereth" in it is a valid antivirus!
[5:33] <chibifs> I was able to use XFCE on Slackware on my 486 laptop better than gnome runs on my i7
[5:33] <vurtual> So you either accept that I have valid reason for being more important than you, and that the entirety of anyone's attempt to make an antivirus was just wasted time, or vista is okay.
[5:34] <EmpiresBane> i'm gonna go now

[6:16] <Azlier> you know to never make tools or armor out of gold, right?
[6:18] <TrueWolves> Why not?
[6:18] <TrueWolves> I always have 1 set of gold tools
[6:19] <Azlier> gold is a very weak metal
[6:19] <TrueWolves> I don't use them, they are jjust for show.
[6:19] <Azlier> i see.
[6:19] <TrueWolves> Gold armor looks epic, ^.^
[6:19] <Azlier> wouldn't those ingots be better invested in gold blocks though?
[6:19] <TrueWolves> I just don't accualy /use/ it.
[6:19] <TrueWolves> gold blocks don't do anything much really
[6:19] <TrueWolves> And it's only 3 blocks worth for a full set of armor
[6:19] <Azlier> neither does your armor if you never use it
[6:19] <TrueWolves> See?
[6:19] <TrueWolves> Neither does a thing
[6:20] <TrueWolves> So I'll put it towards soemthing athesticly pleasing.
[6:20] <Azlier> but the gold blocks at least you have out all the time
[6:20] <Vis{ROTR2010}> My hopes are futile!
[6:20] <TrueWolves> That's /your/ reasoning
[6:20] <Azlier> my reasoning is correct!
[6:20] <Azlier> it always it!
[6:20] <TrueWolves> I'd rather have a set of armor, everyone will have their own preferinces.
[6:20] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Alas!
[6:20] <TrueWolves> Now your just being a Troll. =P
[6:20] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I cannot figure out how to change blocks!
[6:20] <Vis{ROTR2010}> It works client side, but not server side :(
[6:22] <Azlier> i don't think you can skin blocks server side quite yet.

Use the fact that the people who don't care won't actually play, and the people who DO save money, and will swarm to my services.

[7:08] <vurtual> Come on guys don't you know this? It's even joked about in kids movies!

[7:10] <vurtual> Or maybe ants that can assume various states, which includes turning into a grappling hook, or antvibrators.

[7:20] <Dysgalt> :l why oh why server do you think you need 3gb of ram
[7:20] <Dysgalt> when you use like 1gb
[7:22] <vurtual> I should take a potato cannon
[7:22] <vurtual> a small carbine-sized one maybe
[7:23] <vurtual> Then fit it with proper rifle-style stuff, and make it fit a grappling hook
[7:23] <vurtual> and have maybe some kind of range finding equipment
[7:24] <vurtual> So I can simply figure out the distance of the object I want to hook around, extend a thing on the rope to the distance+a little bit, aim slightly above by a bit, then fire it like a gun.
[7:24] <vurtual> So it goes up, stops due to the nylon rope's stopper-thing, jolts down, and hooks.
[7:24] <Dysgalt> So you can be Rico!
[7:25] <vurtual> Grappling hooks don't work like that.

[7:33] <vurtual> I had the idea of changing the camo
[7:33] <vurtual> to a faction color
[7:33] <vurtual> So you had a Red, Orange/Cyan, and Yellow rico.
[7:33] <vurtual> maybe just when you go near eachother
[7:34] <vurtual> And ingame you have a GPS that shows where everyone is, if they have their GPS on.
[7:34] <Dysgalt> They'd have to make it so you couldn't go to far from each other
[7:34] <Dysgalt> and mess the game up
[7:34] <Dysgalt> by rapidly loading large amouns of land
[7:34] <Dysgalt> amounts*
[7:34] <vurtual> You could theoretically use p2p play
[7:35] <vurtual> if you were just like, friends playing around

[7:50] <Animator> Wait.

[8:01] <vurtual> so wait why was there so much about the game being not moddable AndrewPH
[8:01] <vurtual> did I miss something?
[8:01] <AndrewPH> It's moddable
[8:01] <AndrewPH> extremely moddable
[8:01] <AndrewPH> Why would they add the dropzone ability if it wasn't?
[8:01] <vurtual> I dunno
[8:02] <AndrewPH> oh god

[8:04] <vurtual> erotic porn charades
[8:04] <Griskard> So incredibly long ago...
[8:05] <vurtual> So wait, if jc2 is moddable
[8:05] <vurtual> How hard would it be to add more land?
[8:05] <vurtual> Or change Panau?
[8:05] <AndrewPH> Um
[8:05] <AndrewPH> Hard to change the land and such
[8:05] <AndrewPH> considering there's no sdk
[8:05] <Bomb_Spammer> It is
[8:05] <Dysgalt> you'd have to add a whole entire new dictory
[8:05] <AndrewPH> the most we can do atm is texture replacements
[8:06] <Dysgalt> Directory*
[8:06] <Bomb_Spammer> A strange fucking feeling
[8:06] <AndrewPH> and models
[8:06] <Dysgalt> bases off no starting point
[8:06] <Dysgalt> based*..
[8:06] <Dysgalt> and then
[8:06] <vurtual> So wait, how is the terrain stored?
[8:06] <Dysgalt> program entire ai patterns into the land
[8:06] <vurtual> It's just a heightmap... right?
[8:06] <Dysgalt> like the cars
[8:06] <Dysgalt> flight patterns
[8:06] <vurtual> and the patterns yeah
[8:06] <vurtual> It seems vaguely enticing though.
[8:06] <Dysgalt> night
[8:06] * Dysgalt is now known as Dys-Sleep
[8:07] <Dys-Sleep> itd be amazing to figure it out
[8:07] <vurtual> You could potentially completely modify the game's concept of freeroaming
[8:07] <vurtual> Add more islands in the world potentially, and only fly between them using modded fast jets at airports.
[8:07] * Dae is now known as AFK|Dae
[8:09] <vurtual> Potentially if you disguised loadzones as some sort of super-extraction, and properly loaded/unloaded game stuff, you could have an infinite number of islaaands.

[9:08] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Rocket launcher with infinite ammo and minigun fire speed!
[9:09] <clockwork> thats
[9:09] <clockwork> just a little op
[9:09] <vurtual> Vis{ROTR2010}, make it mindblowingly weak
[9:09] <clockwork> also, would make a greate multiplayer mod
[9:09] <vurtual> but capible of hurting everything
[9:09] <Dys-Sleep> yah
[9:09] <Dys-Sleep> like base sized explosions
[9:09] <Dys-Sleep> then make another one
[9:09] <vurtual> radiation gun
[9:09] <Dys-Sleep> with tiny explosions
[9:09] <Dys-Sleep> but throws
[9:09] <Dys-Sleep> people
[9:09] <Dys-Sleep> like
[9:09] <Dys-Sleep> forever
[9:10] <vurtual> You can make guns fire anything
[9:10] <vurtual> Like, a grenade launcher
[9:10] <vurtual> that fires C4
[9:10] <Dys-Sleep> MAKE IT FIRE STRIPPERS
[9:10] <clockwork> go for trees
[9:10] <vurtual> well any bullet
[9:10] <vurtual> OOH
[9:10] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Can I make it fire helecopters?
[9:10] <vurtual> You could make a custom pipebomb launcher
[9:10] <Vis{ROTR2010}> o.o
[9:10] <vurtual> that's a grenade launcher, firing grenades
[9:10] <Dys-Sleep> Make a stripper a bullet
[9:10] <vurtual> with a 10 second fuse, that make a huge firebomb.
[9:10] <vurtual> or a nuke blast
[9:10] <Vis{ROTR2010}> BOOM
[9:10] <clockwork> this is sounding like Borderlands
[9:11] <vurtual> with a huge range
[9:11] <clockwork> "shotgun that fires rockects that fires acid"
[9:11] <vurtual> I'm not sure if firing C4s lets you actually set them off
[9:11] <vurtual> also you could turn the C4s into nukes
[9:11] <Dys-Sleep> Descending into the depths of hell
[9:11] <vurtual> Like, pocket nukes that you carry 99999 of for 0 dollars
[9:11] <Dys-Sleep> with 14 iron pickaxes
[9:11] <vurtual> or just 1, for 0 dollars
[9:11] <vurtual> Dys-Sleep, infdev?

[9:12] <Bomb_Spammer> http://garyc.me/fun/bring.swf
[9:13] <vurtual> vis, make a railgun
[9:13] <vurtual> turn the rocket launcher into a weapon firing ultra-fast rockets that just instantly deal massive damage
[9:13] <clockwork> Want a real one? they're not hard to make
[9:13] <vurtual> as bullets
[9:13] <clockwork> given the compnenets
[9:13] <clockwork> oooh
[9:13] <vurtual> actually ADD one
[9:13] <vurtual> Huge ammo cap, but only one round at a time
[9:14] <clockwork> make a launcher that fires machine guns that are shooting
[9:14] <vurtual> not sure how easy it is to do "illogical" projectiles
[9:14] <vurtual> You can certainly take any current projectiles that rico can use
[9:14] <vurtual> grenades, partially nonfunctional C4
[9:15] <vurtual> you could make a demoman gun firing grenades like a minigun, or even the demoman's pipe launcher with custom models... not sure how hard those are.
[9:15] <clockwork> isn't there a grenade that splits into like 6 mini grenades?
[9:16] <vurtual> in jc2?
[9:16] <vurtual> No
[9:16] <vurtual> Not that I've seen.
[9:16] <vurtual> but the demolition officers explode into grenades

[9:30] <Roadcrosser> my tower now doubles as a refugee base!
[9:32] <vurtual> here's how modding went clockwork
[9:32] <vurtual> he spawned the world
[9:33] <Rooster> I'm both frightened and excited for MP Survival
[9:33] <vurtual> It is a mystery
[9:33] <clockwork> he spawned the world...
[9:34] <outsomnia> What I'd like to know though, is it going to be on public/notchbrand servers, or many smaller servers like now?
[9:34] <clockwork> that sounds alem and epic at the same time
[9:34] <Malikat> i will host a multiplayer server
[9:34] <clockwork> is there a linux server?
[9:35] <clockwork> i would totally throw one up if there is.
[9:36] <Roadcrosser> mm
[9:38] <clockwork> Anybody try OpenCraft before?
[9:38] <AndrewPH> it sux
[9:38] <AndrewPH> don't use it

[10:00] <RoALTcrosser> what is it
[10:00] <Clockwork> i think its kinda like a folding table

[10:02] <vurtual> ANYTHING
[10:02] <vurtual> This is awesome
[10:02] <vurtual> setting the scope value to 50
[10:02] <vurtual> 0 does just pointing, 1 gives you no zoom but scope, and 3 is what the sniper uses.
[10:02] <Clockwork> did someone find a config file?
[10:03] <vurtual> jc2 modding, not minecraft btw
[10:03] <vurtual> also vehicle damage factor to 999 instead of 0.85
[10:03] <Azathoth> do what now?
[10:03] <Clockwork> LOL
[10:03] <Clockwork> shot a tank with a hand gun, it explodes in many pieces
[10:03] <Azathoth> that's realistic
[10:04] <Malikat> rofl what vurtual
[10:04] <vurtual> it's the assault rifle
[10:04] <vurtual> it's not isntakilling anythiiing
[10:04] <vurtual> NEED MORE DAKKA
[10:04] <Malikat> super zoom?
[10:04] <vurtual> 50 also had no zoom
[10:04] <vurtual> let's try 5
[10:04] <Clockwork> uhh, i doubt it
[10:04] <Clockwork> i don't think its that kind of scale
[10:04] <vurtual> oh wait, I forgot to convert the file
[10:05] <KodaichiZero> guys look at this video, it's such a blatant rip-off of TF2 it's hilarious http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvaQbntJ4Yw&feature=player_embedded
[10:05] <vurtual> now let's try this again, 50 and 999
[10:05] <vurtual> KodaichiZero, that korean game?
[10:05] <vurtual> if it's that korean game, it's parodying it
[10:05] <vurtual> and isn't even an fps
[10:05] <KodaichiZero> lol yeeah HAVE online
[10:05] <vurtual> but there's still that chinese super mario galaxy
[10:05] <KodaichiZero> ?
[10:06] <vurtual> okay scope value 50 does nothing
[10:06] <vurtual> but one bullet blew up a truck
[10:06] <KodaichiZero> I love the dialogue of the trailer

[10:08] <Rooster> Super Shrek
[10:08] <Clockwork> vurtual: what are you doing
[10:08] <Clockwork> just blowing everything up?
[10:08] <vurtual> yes
[10:09] <vurtual> with a normal ar, level 4
[10:09] <vurtual> but it has the damage value scale to vehicles changed from 0.85 to 999
[10:09] <vurtual> rather than slowly chewing a car down
[10:09] <vurtual> it instnatly blows up ANYTHING in one shot
[10:09] <vurtual> as long as it's a vehicle
[10:09] <Clockwork> gets boring after like 30min
[10:10] <RoALTcrosser> I want it THAT way
[10:10] <RoALTcrosser> SO I want you to make it THAT way
[10:10] <vurtual> apparently there's a mod
[10:10] <vurtual> that turns the revolver into a gun that fires pieces of buildings
[10:10] <RoALTcrosser> Tell me why, you don't wanna make it THAT way
[10:10] <Clockwork> tell me why

[10:14] <vurtual> fires .40S&W

[11:02] <vurtual> so basicall
[11:02] <vurtual> I have a gun so incredibly illegal
[11:03] <vurtual> that the strongest military forces are deployed after me
[11:03] <Sparky20> what game is this?

[11:04] <Azathoth> tiny castle?
[11:04] <outsomnia> A tiny castle
[11:04] <Azathoth> oh
[11:04] <Azathoth> i thought it was a big one
[11:04] <vurtual> okay I finally touched it with a bomb
[11:04] <vurtual> one of the errorchoppers
[11:05] <vurtual> (which are unsafe to look at, at first)
[11:05] <Azathoth> wow how lame
[11:05] <vurtual> ...and it just instadied
[11:05] <Azathoth> i have to allow doubleclick.net to play this game
[11:05] <Roadcrosser> http://www.nitrome.com/games/tinycastle/ here
[11:05] <vurtual> then another bomb blew off the half
[11:05] <Myselfe> imagine if every block in minecraft had physics
[11:05] <vurtual> buildings sorta flop into jello
[11:06] <vurtual> oka
[11:06] <vurtual> okay, what should I do with my awesome rifle
[11:06] <Malikat> do a barrel roll
[11:06] <Myselfe> put it on your mouth
[11:06] <Myselfe> and pull the trigger
[11:06] <vurtual> you just spin
[11:06] <vurtual> and spin
[11:06] <vurtual> and spin
[11:06] <vurtual> until touched
[11:06] <vurtual> then, instant fire and explosion

[11:08] <vurtual> why do I keep missing
[11:08] <vurtual> I died so quickly that the game remembered I had just accessed the black market at that spot
[11:11] <Sparky20> What game is this?
[11:11] <vurtual> just cause 2
[11:11] <vurtual> but I found out how to mod it
[11:11] <AndrewPH> Triggered explosive mod
[11:11] <vurtual> So that I turned a stereotypical assault rifle into a deathray
[11:11] <AndrewPH> gives it a nuke explosion pretty much
[11:11] <AndrewPH> or I forget which one I got
[11:11] <vurtual> It has a scope, whcih is nice
[11:12] <vurtual> bullets do 999x damage to vehicles(oh hey instant kill on most things)
[11:12] <vurtual> 100x impulse or whatever, I think that's physics
[11:12] <vurtual> fires 100 bullets at once, which become a single bullet of superness
[11:12] <vurtual> as well as a random few tweaks that do nothing
[11:13] <vurtual> If it wasn't likely to cause the game to freak out from me holding one, I could make it one-handed and dual wield them
[11:13] <Sparky20> coom
[11:13] <Sparky20> cool*
[11:13] <vurtual> shooting heavier vehicles would result in them just instantly becoming a scorched wreckage
[11:13] <vurtual> I shot a fighter plane and it would be shoved back
[11:13] <vurtual> shoved hard enough it'd die
[11:13] <vurtual> shooting lighter vehicles does anywhere between just POOF, tires/nothing
[11:13] <vurtual> and them launching inifnite away
[11:13] <Sparky20> make it do no damage but have a lot of push
[11:13] <vurtual> shooting someone does actions between a huge pillar of blood
[11:14] <vurtual> or sending them into the air
[11:14] <vurtual> I've shot the reapers cars and had the gunner just flop down
[11:14] <vurtual> and walk around fine
[11:14] <Malikat> donnie darko was a weird weird movie
[11:14] <vurtual> also hitting any civilian vehicle results in instant heat level 5, which results in amazingly actiony supermusic, and things like rocket-armed choppers to come
[11:15] <outsomnia> All in the name of JUSTISSSSSS
[11:15] <vurtual> just cause
[11:15] <vurtual> just 'cause I can
[11:15] <AndrewPH> ALL FOR DA REE PAHZ
[11:15] <vurtual> Most of the game is apparently capible of being modified this way
[11:15] <vurtual> so basically deathmatch can result
[11:16] <vurtual> factions vs factions
[11:16] <vurtual> I think maybe police attacking civilians
[11:16] <vurtual> maybe... armed civilians
[11:16] <vurtual> EVERYTHING OUT TO KILL YOU, ON ONE SIDE
[11:16] <outsomnia> Superhero civvies, do it.

[15:10] <bildramer> Open all ports, you say?
[15:10] <bildramer> no
[15:10] <Yohanu> no
[15:10] <Yohanu> it is called DMZ
[15:10] <Yohanu> in router

[15:10] * Ash_kin slaps a large trout around with bildramer
[15:10] <Yohanu> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)
[15:10] <Malikat> just make sure your ports are open, use portforward.com
[15:10] <bildramer> just saw that
[15:10] <bildramer> why should my ports be open
[15:11] <bildramer> I'm not a server/host
[15:11] <chibifs> because directplay sucks
[15:11] <chibifs> and knocks the serving on to the next player when someone dies
[15:11] <bildramer> wait

[15:23] <IDTL> if the sun rises in the east and sets in the west
[15:23] <Ash_kin> Before sunrises happened, direction would've been impossible.

[15:49] <IDTL> I remember I used to go to some other IRC channel on another server
[15:49] <copyboy> depends on how active the channel is
[15:49] <IDTL> it had admin, owner, half op
[15:49] <IDTL> tons of stuff
[15:49] <copyboy> 1 op/5 active users or so

[15:51] <IDTL> I think MC is turning into another one of those unfinished indie games
[15:51] <copyboy> the most important thing is more awesomeness
[15:51] <CruelNoise> what exactly would one use memoserv for?
[15:51] <Marach> IDTL: just because there was no update for some time?
[15:51] <IDTL> I get paranoid man
[15:51] <Marach> CruelNoise: you can send memos for users that are offline

[15:52] <Marach> it stores then and notifies when they come online

[15:52] <CruelNoise> hmm... is iguana online...?
[15:52] <Iguana> No.

[15:52] <IDTL> Good times
[15:52] <IDTL> The community got so goddamn pissed when we clearcut the forest
[15:53] <SpriteFire> IDTL: i remember the first wave of that invasion. it was hilarious

[15:53] <IDTL> "Oh no they ruined like one mile of our 5000000 mile map, let's spam them about paying for membership!"
[15:53] <IDTL> oh god the NOISE when you were walking up to brotopia

[15:54] <IDTL> I only got one picture of it sadly
[15:54] <CruelNoise> should i bother trying to play wurm? it seems interseting, but many say it sucks.
[15:55] <IDTL> Okay, it's like minecraft, with the blocks, but the blocks are waay bigger
[15:55] <IDTL> and the gameplay is wayyy slower
[15:55] <SpriteFire> CruelNoise: dont do it. unless you enjoy hurting yourself
[15:55] <SpriteFire> then yeah sure wurm is for you
[15:55] <IDTL> You could take half an hour to get the materials for an axe
[15:55] <IDTL> and "You fumble while constructing the axe"
[15:55] <Marach> IDTL: nothing much
[15:55] <IDTL> And you lose all the materials and have to start all over
[15:55] <Marach> comparing to MHFU.
[15:56] <IDTL> took me 5 fucking hours to get a one block house frame and two walls
[15:56] <IDTL> Never playing it again
[15:56] <Marach> IDTL: i tried to play it. crashed on loading
[15:56] <IDTL> The monsters have no animations, they're all weird colors and shit, like dark GREEN
[15:56] <IDTL> You were spared, take it as a blessing
[15:56] <IDTL> and never try to play again
[15:56] <Marach> roger
[15:57] <IDTL> There's no way to tell NSEW as far as I know
[15:57] <IDTL> no minimap
[15:57] <IDTL> all the community does it beg you to pay to transfer your account to other servers, probably some goddamn bot rolf made
[15:58] <IDTL> They flip out and hate you instantly if they find out you go to /v/
[15:58] <IDTL> and they tell EVERYONE you do

[16:05] <Superwafflez> wait what
[16:05] <Superwafflez> one block

[16:06] <Superwafflez> probably teleport spells or something
[16:06] <chibifs> wololo
[16:07] <IDTL> then the other person types the code in it to get to yours
[16:07] <Malikat> if people are retarded or the server forces them to spawn in random areas without reasonable constraints, then it'll be like single player
[16:07] <Malikat> but more likely they'll chill in the same areas
[16:07] <Malikat> and build in the same region
[16:07] <IDTL> People should start in a town with traders and stuff
[16:07] <Superwafflez> towns are gonna be made :D
[16:07] <chibifs> Or it'd be like some MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER DIGGING GAME
[16:07] <IDTL> and you should be unable to build in the town
[16:07] <CruelNoise> Keiya: tgat wiykd be pretty win..
[16:07] <Superwafflez> Im thinking its going to turn into an mmo
[16:07] <IDTL> or attack
[16:07] <Superwafflez> even though its not meant to
[16:07] <IDTL> EIGHT PLAYER MMO
[16:08] <Superwafflez> its been said the player cap is being increased...
[16:08] <Superwafflez> so maybe... :D
[16:08] <chibifs> 14k purchases, I think it'll be more than 8 people per server.
[16:08] <Keiya> CruelNoise: Hells yes, it would
[16:08] <Malikat> i'm going to have a huge player cap
[16:08] <Malikat> i'm hoping for 96 though i'll settle for 64
[16:08] <Superwafflez> Must make everyone go to the same server
[16:08] <IDTL> notch said it's only gonna be like 8-16 player
[16:09] <Superwafflez> =/
[16:09] <IDTL> He doesn't want it to be a mmo
[16:09] <CruelNoise> i'm playing video games now!
[16:09] <Malikat> D: <
[16:09] <Superwafflez> need more than 16 players on an infinite map.
[16:09] <Foshie> Notch need to release an update, his sales per day is dropping ..
[16:09] <Malikat> i know more than 16 people who want to play on my map.
[16:09] <IDTL> Dude minecraft would be such an awesome MMO
[16:09] <IDTL> seriously
[16:10] <IDTL> It's like wurm, but good
[16:10] <Superwafflez> It doesnt have to solely by an mmo

[16:13] <Superwafflez> We're getting signs :D
[16:13] <CruelNoise> didin't we talk about that a while ago
[16:14] <chibifs> Signs is a good start. remote art files would be cooler though.
[16:14] <CruelNoise> like, giant penises on the walls of underground caverns?
[16:14] <chibifs> yes
[16:14] <Superwafflez> Awesome
[16:14] <CruelNoise> underground orgies?
[16:14] <CruelNoise> i think vede said something about underground orgies
[16:14] <Superwafflez> Minecraft porn... oh wait...
[16:14] <IDTL> Signs have been confirmed since the first survival test
[16:14] <IDTL> Dude's there's plently of minecraft porn now
[16:14] <IDTL> Just go checkout paheal
[16:14] <Superwafflez> Hence the 'oh wait...'
[16:15] <chibifs> I think survival is going to be really cool because everyone plays in their own unique way.
[16:15] <IDTL> I always build underwater ones I get the resources
[16:15] <IDTL> Always.
[16:15] <IDTL> Low prices
[16:16] <chibifs> I usually go on adventures and try to connect the caverns underground in deep maps.
[16:16] <chibifs> If I get too deep, I will live underground instead of above.
[16:16] <Superwafflez> Not on infdev D:
[16:16] <Superwafflez> no caves
[16:16] <Superwafflez> yet
[16:16] <IDTL> I wonder if you go deep enough there will be a hell area

[16:18] <Malikat> Superwafflez: you mean taking the browns to the superbowl?
[16:18] <Ausfriend> IDTL: And that opening to the hell area should provoke a torrent of demons
[16:18] <Ausfriend> DF anyone?
[16:18] <Yohanu> it shall be interesting to see if anyone can hunt you down chibifs
[16:18] <Superwafflez> Malikat: yus.
[16:18] <Yohanu> Superwafflez, etc
[16:18] <Yohanu> you need to be moar aggressive!
[16:18] <IDTL> That could be abused to hilariously aus
[16:18] <Yohanu> everyone is neutral right now
[16:18] <Yohanu> no fun
[16:18] <Yohanu> :(
[16:18] <IDTL> so*
[16:18] <Superwafflez> Heh
[16:18] <Superwafflez> Biding my time
[16:18] <Superwafflez> then
[16:18] <IDTL> dig below someone's base straight to hell
[16:18] <Superwafflez> bam
[16:19] <chibifs> I dunno. My camps are usually 3x3
[16:19] <chibifs> at most
[16:19] <Yohanu> that is the problem Superwafflez
[16:19] <Yohanu> lol
[16:19] <Ausfriend> But it'd be so awesome
[16:19] <Yohanu> everyone is booming
[16:19] <Yohanu> i was the only one aggressing
[16:19] <Ausfriend> Or you could balance it by making hell VERY deep
[16:19] <Ausfriend> or VERY tough to dig through (like DF, Slade/Adam is impossible/fucking hard to dig through respectively)
[16:19] <Malikat> needs more bildramer
[16:19] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[16:19] <Malikat> he's eating 40 big macs
[16:19] <Ten_Tacles> Yes.
[16:19] <Yohanu> agree
[16:20] <Malikat> that's the same as 4 tens
[16:20] <Malikat> and that's terribly slow
[16:20] <Malikat> wait why is the game unpaused
[16:20] <chibifs> I really think inf should be able to go as deep as it does side to side.
[16:20] <chibifs> :)
[16:20] <chibifs> I know that won't happen.
[16:20] <IDTL> 512 would be fine
[16:21] <chibifs> And Yohanu, if you're talking about aoe, I don't have the resources to survive another attack.

[17:47] <Malikat> idk!
[17:47] <DrPayne> I think that summoning things should take idols or sacrifices
[17:47] <Malikat> like mana stones
[17:48] <DrPayne> Or maybe it could be like eternal darkness, where theres runes that can be combined for a bunch of effects.
[17:49] <Malikat> oh god
[17:49] <Malikat> i love that game
[17:49] <DrPayne> ULYAOTH FTW
[17:49] <Malikat> i'd like runes as control (choosing what you cast / craft into enchantment)
[17:49] <Malikat> and mana stones as power
[17:49] <Malikat> and sometimes reagents / components
[17:50] <DrPayne> Yeah, though trying to spell shit with runes would be fun! Like mad evil wizard fun!
[17:50] <Malikat> so like, to create a golem, you'd need enough mana stones to power the cast, you'd need to cast like create earth being strong, and you'd need dirt
[17:50] <Malikat> lots. of. dirt.

[17:52] <DrPayne> so, if i was to summon a powerful demigod, i would prolly have to show my devotion to him, like giving an idol or sacrificing something
[17:54] <DrPayne> And mind you, to gather all these magical materials, you'd have to slay monsters, dig down to hell, and gather stuff. "Griefers" wouldn't be griefers at that point, they would be evil cultists

[18:22] <Cheeseyx> I know how to delete individual things from my history
[18:22] <genida> Not when you're drunk, obiviously.
[18:22] <Cheeseyx> Well, I would have had to clear it at exactly midnight or so

[18:40] <Silver_Shadow> hey
[18:40] <genida> The lighting bug might get in the way of progress though.
[18:40] <Silver_Shadow> Yeah
[18:40] <Silver_Shadow> I've encountered it a few times
[18:40] <Superwafflez> all my new infdev worlds have the light bug
[18:40] <Silver_Shadow> D:
[18:40] <Superwafflez> and my good world screwed up and deleted my base
[18:41] <Superwafflez> this square bit
[18:41] <Silver_Shadow> that sucks
[18:41] <Superwafflez> the rest was fine
[18:41] <Silver_Shadow> What I find odd is that when I convert a .dat file to a .mclevel file everything is fucked up.
[18:41] <Superwafflez> i came up from the depths of my mine and the door to my house's lower levels was sealed with dirt and rock
[18:41] <Superwafflez> yah
[18:41] <genida> I'm terrified of when water physics comes to infdev. I'm not so sure my mines are safe...
[18:41] <Silver_Shadow> lighting, etc
[18:41] <Silver_Shadow> ah
[18:41] <Silver_Shadow> I have a mine too
[18:42] <Superwafflez> it was a major wtf moment
[18:42] <Silver_Shadow> I found it while digging a moat
[18:42] <Superwafflez> heh
[18:42] <Silver_Shadow> x]
[18:42] <Superwafflez> had to dig myself out of my own mine
[18:42] <Silver_Shadow> XD

[18:42] <Superwafflez> =D
[18:43] <Silver_Shadow> BTW, does anyone want a tutorial I made for converting .dat into .mclevel?
[18:43] <Superwafflez> ill take a pic of the bug i experienced... or corruption
[18:43] <Superwafflez> umm... post on the forums would be best I think
[18:43] <Silver_Shadow> linky is here:
[18:43] <Silver_Shadow> http://filesmelt.com/dl/.bat_to__.mclevel_tutorial_2.txt
[18:43] <Silver_Shadow> I misspelled .dat

[21:31] <melibe> no idea which direction its in from the spawn point
[21:32] <melibe> I know I walked a long way
[21:32] <melibe> I want to wait for sand to be added anyways
[21:32] <Dysgalt> I just build a hugeass base where i spawn
[21:32] <genida> melibe, dig a deep hole and noclip to see where your map goes.
[21:33] <LuciferZ> Building in infdev takes too long and I get lonely. So I still play creative.
[21:33] <melibe> no idea how to do that, but personally not that interested :U
[21:33] <genida> You just build two blocks where you stand, and you get stuck in the blocks. Try it anywhere.
[21:34] <melibe> and that somehow lets you see through things?
[21:34] <LuciferZ> SPLOITS
[21:34] <TrueWolves> yeah
[21:34] <TrueWolves> it does
[21:34] <TrueWolves> It's a glitch

[21:34] <melibe> well maybe I will do that
[21:34] <TrueWolves> It's an acent sandburing minecraft ritual... or just a glitch
[21:34] <TrueWolves> take your pick
[21:34] <melibe> Im still mad about all that iron ore and stone I lost on death, though :I
[21:35] <genida> That's always a shame. Keep more boxes :)
[21:35] <melibe> I thought boxes were glitched
[21:35] <melibe> I had everything on my person
[21:35] <genida> They are? I've had boxes from the get-go. No trouble at all.
[21:35] <TrueWolves> They are fixed
[21:36] <Dysgalt> I started out with 27 iron pickaxes
[21:36] <Dysgalt> i only have 3 left
[21:36] <Dysgalt> :l
[21:37] <genida> You have 300 iron Dysgalt. And diamonds. I hate you so jealously much but not really.
[21:37] <LuciferZ> Guys, my infdev map is glitched
[21:37] <Dysgalt> Moar like 650 iron blocks
[21:37] <LuciferZ> I have unlimited amounts of every block
[21:38] <Dysgalt> Creative mode?
[21:38] <LuciferZ> And lighting is borked
[21:38] <gdude2002> you rang, Dysgalt?

[21:56] <copyboy> naah
[21:56] <Mugendai> alright
[21:57] <copyboy> it is big tho
[21:57] <TrueWolves> I hope dynamic lighting is an option in creative, I don't want the current lighting 100% replaced, but a simple on/off deal...
[21:57] <copyboy> depends on how much place you need

[22:02] <TrueWolves> good
[22:02] <Animator> Narrator automatically turned itself on.
[22:02] <Animator> I'm worried.
[22:02] <TrueWolves> I've only ever died twice in infdev XD
[22:03] <TrueWolves> hm?
[22:03] <TrueWolves> odd
[22:03] <Dysgalt> I died 40 times in a row once
[22:03] <Dysgalt> within 10 minutes
[22:03] <genida> Do tell.
[22:03] <Dysgalt> My spawn is located on a huge tower
[22:03] <Dysgalt> and i forgot to place a couple blocks
[22:03] <vurtual> Animator, they're either interested in you, or are the terminarrator.
[22:03] <Dysgalt> so i had to aim myself
[22:03] <Dysgalt> so i wouldn't die
[22:03] <Dysgalt> worst mistake i ever made :l
[22:04] <Dysgalt> But on the plus side
[22:04] <Dysgalt> I have a pit full of bodies
[22:04] <vurtual> yup
[22:04] <Dysgalt> but if i fall in
[22:04] <genida> Decoration item of high importance. I've never died on infdev, so I might not get a body-pit...
[22:04] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[22:05] <Dysgalt> I like mah body pit
[22:05] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[22:05] <Dysgalt> just dont fall in cause thats kinky

[23:50] <Quatroking> fire can't melt
[23:51] <Quatroking> that doesn't make any sense

[23:52] * Fairstpierre (Mibbit@c-24-147-146-53.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[23:52] <Snowman> Seriously, that's the first thing I turned off
[23:52] <Aeomin> need time to get used to superbar..
[23:52] <Snowman> Just change it
[23:53] <Snowman> I now have the standard bar with just the pinned items
[23:53] <Snowman> And the aero peek ofc
[23:53] <mail2345> aghhh
[23:53] <mail2345> okay
[23:53] <mail2345> how do i fix this
[23:53] <Aeomin> the standard bar with aero looks ugly IMO
[23:53] <Snowman> Fix what?
[23:53] <mail2345> the standard bar
[23:53] <mail2345> makes mIRC windows
[23:53] <mail2345> run into hiding

[23:54] <Quatroking> xchat ftw
[23:54] <Aeomin> mirc costs =(
[23:55] <Quatroking> 2 that is
[23:55] <vurtual> Like, playing music on my one computer, using the other
[23:55] <vurtual> also mirc is free
[23:55] <Quatroking> xchat 2 is freeware
[23:55] <Quatroking> mirc isn't freeware
[23:55] <Quatroking> quit saying it is, its not.
[23:55] <Snowman> It's nagware
[23:55] <T> It's technically shareware yeah, but you never have to pay for it.
[23:55] <Aeomin> $20
[23:55] <Snowman> It's like WinRAR
[23:55] <Snowman> But WinRAR like fails
[23:55] <Quatroking> its trialware with shitty security
[23:55] <Quatroking> notch security
[23:55] <T> It just makes you wait about 10 seconds before you can use it.
[23:55] <Quatroking> "please don't steal this okay"
[23:56] <Snowman> pl0x dun steel!
[23:56] <Aeomin> lol notch security
[23:56] <T> My copy thinks I've been using it for like 16,000 days.
[23:56] <Snowman> Quatroking, it got stolen
[23:56] <ylt> i just reset the trial when ever it gets near end (a registry key containing unix time)
[23:56] <Snowman> And it made him angry
[23:56] <Snowman> Let me quote Notch:
[23:56] <Snowman> "Thank you.. Grr.
[23:56] <Snowman> I don't want to add DRM to the game, it hurts legitimate players. But this sucks. :-("
[23:56] <mail2345> okay
[23:56] <mail2345> finally fixed
[23:57] <Quatroking> how many legit players were unable to play it due to drm?
[23:57] <T> He could just put DRM on the server software.
[23:57] <Quatroking> about 10?
[23:57] <Snowman> Quatroking, it fucked up his code
[23:57] <Snowman> So he got rid of it
