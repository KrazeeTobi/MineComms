[0:04] <Kitoari> imo age is pointless on the web
[0:04] <vurtual> unless like, someone in their late 30s and 40s showed up
[0:04] <Deepa> Kitoari: age is very important on the web
[0:04] <Deepa> Else porn can get uncomfortable pretty quick
[0:04] <Wolfeh> Deepa yeah, but maturity is more important
[0:05] <Kitoari> ... you know that's not what I meant.
[0:05] <Pelum> well according to you im of a young age, but in reality im over 25
[0:05] <Deepa> But you know that's what I mean't ;-)
[0:05] <Deepa> Pelum: isn't that technically young?
[0:05] <ouT|Phaze> vurtual: you come in here and constantly sound like a child

[0:06] <Wolfeh> holy shit
[0:06] <Wolfeh> did you make that?
[0:06] <Kitoari> very impressive!
[0:06] <sorre> not bad
[0:06] <sorre> not bad at all
[0:06] <ouT|Phaze> is that an adminium floor?
[0:07] <HaVoK> That's awesome
[0:07] <ouT|Phaze> HOW IS IT SO FLAT?!
[0:07] <sorre> editing, no doubt
[0:07] <ouT|Phaze> how do you edit adminium
[0:07] <X_Warrior411> You use a map program.
[0:07] <Phil> guys how many rail roads can i get out of 2 stacks?
[0:07] <X_Warrior411> Like Omen or NBT Forge.
[0:07] <Phil> stacks of silver ore stuff *
[0:07] <ouT|Phaze> Omen works for Alpha?
[0:08] <Wolfeh> Phil, you get 16 from one
[0:08] <X_Warrior411> I wouldn't know.
[0:08] <Soviet> i use NBT forge to prepare the floor
[0:08] <X_Warrior411> I don't use it.
[0:08] <Soviet> providing some basic shape like cubes and cylinders
[0:08] <Wolfeh> @Phil so at that point that would be 36
[0:08] <Wolfeh> *32
[0:08] <Soviet> and then making the spherical cave, the rest is one block at a time editing
[0:08] <X_Warrior411> I only used NBT Forge to drain the water in my underwater base...
[0:08] <Soviet> including the stairs on the left
[0:09] <Deepa> I've been thinking about using Omen to fix my broken water

[0:09] <X_Warrior411> What's wrong with it?
[0:09] <Dommys> Just use doors.
[0:09] <Deepa> X_Warrior411: my sea has streams
[0:09] <Deepa> they have a tendency to almost drown me
[0:09] * Jaska- (quassel@dsl-olubrasgw1-ff85c300-6.dhcp.inet.fi) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)

[0:10] <Wolfeh> That's alot..
[0:10] <Phil> not for waht i need to do
[0:10] <Wolfeh> What do you need to do?
[0:10] <ouT|Phaze> 32 isn't very much for most of the mines I've dug =>_>=
[0:10] <ouT|Phaze> that's help like... the entrance
[0:10] <Phil> i want to mark out some very long tracks for a game im gonna try prototyping in MC
[0:11] <Phil> just to see about timing anyways

[0:12] <Cat> hey Wolfeh
[0:12] <ouT|Phaze> might anyone else in here know why my game is running at 1-3fps?
[0:13] <ouT|Phaze> it was running at 100+ yesterday
[0:13] <Cat> ouT|Phaze cancer.
[0:13] <ouT|Phaze> even deleting the .minecraft folder in my appdata solved nothing
[0:13] <ouT|Phaze> and restarting
[0:13] <ouT|Phaze> etc.
[0:13] <Wolfeh> cat -.-
[0:13] <Cat> ouT|Phaze try diffrent save/map
[0:13] <ouT|Phaze> (ouT|Phaze) even deleting the .minecraft folder in my appdata solved nothing
[0:13] <ouT|Phaze> 02:13:08 (ouT|Phaze) and restarting
[0:13] <ouT|Phaze> I deleted my saves
[0:13] <X_Warrior411> Anyone know what time it is in sweden?
[0:14] <ouT|Phaze> it runs at 1-3fps, even in the main menu
[0:14] <X_Warrior411> Something's probably taking your resources.
[0:14] <ouT|Phaze> everything else works fine
[0:14] <Wolfeh> X_Warrior411 I'm pretty sure its 9:14 AM, just like here
[0:14] <Cat> X_Warrior411 9:15 i think
[0:14] <ouT|Phaze> hell, I can run two copies of EVE at 100+fps
[0:14] <Wolfeh> 9:14 :>
[0:14] <ouT|Phaze> yet minecraft is running at 1-3fps
[0:14] <Bodie> man, creative mode creeps me out now
[0:14] <Phil> im hungry
[0:14] <Bodie> after not playing it for so long
[0:14] <Bodie> BLOCKS ARE SO BREAKY
[0:15] <Wolfeh> felt the same afew days ago
[0:15] <Cat> Wolfeh ur clock is wrong update it...
[0:15] <X_Warrior411> I haven't placed creative in months...

[0:16] <Phil> how can anything generate this crap randomly
[0:16] <asiekierka> i only play it

[0:16] <asiekierka> i dont play alpha
[0:16] <asiekierka> at all
[0:16] <Wolfeh> liq3 Creative never was crap, it can get boring though
[0:16] <ouT|Phaze> liq3: yeah, but I played classic way before alpha came out, and then didn't pick minecraft back up until a few days ago
[0:16] <esper_oldttz> is it already to late to get a multiplayer invite?
[0:16] <ouT|Phaze> it was alright then
[0:16] <ouT|Phaze> but it is complete crap now
[0:16] <asiekierka> esper_oldttz: Yes.
[0:16] <liq3> Wolfeh: well that's what i mean... It's fun for about 10-20 hours then it's duuurrrrrrrr.
[0:16] <asiekierka> Everyone got them, just not you. [/troll]
[0:17] <liq3> The 500+ replayability will be in SMP and it's mods.
[0:17] <liq3> hour*
[0:17] <Wolfeh> liq3 I got about a day or two, but then I got bored, survival survival survival, and then back to creative
[0:17] <Wolfeh> liq3 So it's not crap :D
[0:17] <esper_oldttz> :<
[0:17] <Wolfeh> liq3 Just take a break from it if you think its crap :>

[0:17] <Cat> liq3 arent you that guy wo made a customserver for creative?
[0:17] <liq3> Cat: kind of.
[0:17] <liq3> It never got finished. >.>
[0:18] <Skorchy> Whats the difference between survival and creative?
[0:18] <liq3> Whole reason I was making it was so I could hard code stuff like spleef and CTF tho.
[0:18] <liq3> :P

[0:18] <liq3> Big difference.

[0:18] <Cat> fail.
[0:18] <Cat> oh
[0:18] <Cat> oky
[0:18] <X_Warrior411> And you can break any blocks instantly...
[0:18] <ouT|Phaze> creative is blah
[0:18] <ouT|Phaze> lol
[0:19] <X_Warrior411> Survival, you got mobs who want to rape you with arrows and blow up...
[0:19] <Phil> creative == suck
[0:19] <X_Warrior411> You got more blocks and entities which let you do many things.
[0:19] <ouT|Phaze> crafting is <3
[0:19] <Wolfeh> Creative doesn't fucking suck
[0:19] <asiekierka> creative is inf blocks
[0:19] <X_Warrior411> You also need to work for tools to get more stuff.
[0:19] <Wolfeh> you just have to be
[0:19] <asiekierka> survival is inf worlds
[0:19] <Wolfeh> CREATIVE
[0:19] <asiekierka> yes, Wolfeh
[0:19] <asiekierka> I agree
[0:19] * Evicous (chatzilla@c-69-244-48-242.hsd1.az.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:19] <X_Warrior411> *Waits for 'Go play creative'*
[0:19] <asiekierka> I made a group of people who love Creative and still play it
[0:19] * ouT|Phaze rephrases
[0:19] <BadCoupon> Creative is going to be awesome when it ties in with Survival
[0:19] <liq3> Wolfeh: it's an inefficient voxel editor. -.-
[0:19] <asiekierka> GO PLAY CREATIVE
[0:19] <ouT|Phaze> to me, creative is complete crap
[0:19] <asiekierka> NOW
[0:19] * Amiculi (Blah@71.93.7.26) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:19] <Phil> if you look up suck in the dictionary, has screen of creative
[0:19] <X_Warrior411> Fact: you can't use torches and ladders in creative...
[0:19] <Phil> oooo burn
[0:19] <Wolfeh> liq3 lol what the hell :>
[0:20] <asiekierka> ouT|Phaze - for me that's almost as saying that you like Justin Bieber, bro
[0:20] <ouT|Phaze> I prefer the exploration of minecraft, something creative mode doesn't give me any of
[0:20] <liq3> Minecraft levels are made of voxels. Creative edits those levels. Thus it's a voxel editor.
[0:20] <liq3> :P
[0:20] <X_Warrior411> If only creative had ladders and minecards...
[0:20] <Phil> yippie
[0:20] <ouT|Phaze> I get a pretty big hardon for good exploration
[0:20] <asiekierka> it will
[0:20] <Skorchy> These caves
[0:20] <asiekierka> in a few months
[0:20] <liq3> an inefficient one at that... No copy/paste, no mass draw, no replace, etc etc.
[0:20] <Skorchy> Are pissing me off
[0:20] * Ecthe (Ecthel@75-13-90-135.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:20] <X_Warrior411> Then I wouldn't mind being told to play creative...
[0:20] <Wolfeh> liq3 I guess.But who said voxel edioors can't be fun?:>
[0:20] <Skorchy> Cause I need TNT to make lots of progress really quickly
[0:21] <Phil> survival = best exploration game created
[0:21] <Ecthe> ...
[0:21] * Ecthe (Ecthel@75-13-90-135.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:21] <X_Warrior411> .....
[0:21] <ouT|Phaze> Phil: I wouldn't say /best
[0:21] <ouT|Phaze> but it's pretty awesome
[0:21] <Wolfeh> You're supposed to leave now X_Warrior411
[0:21] <X_Warrior411> It is.
[0:21] <Wolfeh> ;O
[0:21] <Soviet> ok.. how many mobs are allowed to spawn at the same time..
[0:21] <liq3> Wolfeh: Well sure. I guess MC creative is more of an art program then a game.
[0:21] <liq3> :p
[0:21] <Nunu> Btw, when the update and blogpost is made, please spam the chat like always so I can see it clearly. :)
[0:21] <ouT|Phaze> MC creative feels like a tech demo
[0:21] <ouT|Phaze> =>_>=
[0:21] <liq3> kind of like those "mass draw" flash things.
[0:21] <Skorchy> Oh screwit.
[0:21] <Wolfeh> liq3 Meh, opinions man ;D
[0:21] <Skorchy> Im tired of trying to kill 8 bajillion creepers to get one stick of TNT
[0:21] <Phil> yes please, ima be waiting for friday update
[0:21] <liq3> Which, I should point out, are crazy popular lol.
[0:22] <sorre> http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.1845
[0:22] <Phil> but itll probably be in a few hours
[0:22] <Shrub> Same skorchy
[0:22] <Skorchy> How.. to.. mod.. you.. blocks... google.
[0:22] <sorre> look at that fucking caps lock key
[0:22] <Zenthos> (Indestructable)
[0:22] <Wolfeh> Anyone still playing indev? I always feel old when I play it :>
[0:22] <Nunu> lol i want that keyboard
[0:22] <Shrub> I loved indev
[0:22] <Phil> indev is still fun
[0:22] <Phil> just basic-er
[0:22] <Zenthos> I kinda like the limited maps
[0:23] <Cat> yeah
[0:23] <Cat> :3
[0:23] * Cue (cueball61@cpc2-alde4-2-0-cust462.6-2.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:23] <Zenthos> you can run out of resouces
[0:23] <Wolfeh> But you need a lot of time
[0:23] * Crodor (troll@88.118.72.131) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:23] <Cat> i hope notch will add finitemaps as an option
[0:23] <ouT|Phaze> why?
[0:23] <ouT|Phaze> I don't really see a point
[0:23] <Wolfeh> Yeah I guess that'd be good :3
[0:23] <liq3> Zenthos: strictly speaking you can "run out" in infdev too.
[0:23] <ouT|Phaze> you don't have to go explore if you don't want
[0:23] <Serow> He's said several times that he will.
[0:23] <liq3> Tho it's much more local.
[0:23] <Wolfeh> Phaze
[0:23] <ouT|Phaze> you don't have to use the "infinite" aspect of the map
[0:24] * KrimZon (krimzon@188-221-214-2.zone12.bethere.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
[0:24] <liq3> I won't be surprised to find people mining out all the iron in a 1024^2 area tho.

[0:24] <Wolfeh> What if some computers can 't support "infinite"?
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> no one is forcing you
[0:24] <Cat> ouT|Phaze, not all ppl like infmaps :3
[0:24] * evaldusia (nnscript@lan70-973.elekta.lt) has joined #minecraft
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> Cat: you don't have to use the "inf" part
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> is my point
[0:24] <Cat> :/
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> you can treat it like map of any side
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> *size
[0:24] <Serow> The map is only as big as you explore...
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> no one is forcing you
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> to explore to make the map bigger
[0:24] <Cat> ...
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> and the bottom is finite
[0:24] * silentangelix (Angelix_th@cpe-98-28-52-46.columbus.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:24] <Cat> but its not limited
[0:24] <ouT|Phaze> so I really don't see a point
[0:24] <silentangelix> Hey guys
[0:25] <liq3> Notch is gonna add limited sizes to infdev anyway. -.-
[0:25] <Cat> wee
[0:25] <Cat> :D
[0:25] * Cat licks her paw
[0:25] <epaGamer> no
[0:25] <silentangelix> I can't wait until Notch adds the level converter so I can continue my old indev save
[0:25] <epaGamer> :O(
[0:25] <esper_oldttz> nooooooo
[0:25] <ouT|Phaze> liq3: someone already said that
[0:25] <esper_oldttz> infdev without inf?
[0:25] <ouT|Phaze> I'm just saying that I don't see the point
[0:25] * Amiculi (Blah@71.93.7.26) has joined #minecraft
[0:25] <ouT|Phaze> if you don't like the infinite part, don't explore to make your map bigger
[0:25] <ouT|Phaze> it's simple

[0:26] <liq3> ouT|Phaze: a lot of servers won't be able to run infdev... e.g most home PCs. :P
[0:26] <Wolfeh> Yeah
[0:26] <Wolfeh> ^+1??
[0:26] <Dommys> My home pc will. :D
[0:26] <liq3> e.g.

[0:26] <liq3> hrm
[0:26] <Wolfeh> Mine will too, but it's because it's still in the top ranks
[0:26] <silentangelix> Phaze; my PC lags quite a bit on Alpha from time to time, when on limited maps I almost never get lag
[0:26] * liq3 facepalms
[0:26] <liq3> ok best example is the CPU strain 32 ppl all exploring would cause.
[0:26] <liq3> D:
[0:27] <Synthpixel> eh?
[0:27] <Plinky> Most of the big server communities in minecraft run off dedicated servers or VPS right now.
[0:27] <ouT|Phaze> you shouldn't be hosting a 32 player game on a pc that can't run it anyway

[0:27] <merculiv> mine runs smooth with win7 q6600 proc 2.4 ghz 3 gb ram
[0:27] <ouT|Phaze> a 32 player game like this is going to be intensive anyway
[0:27] <vurtual> so guys you know the Katina stage of star fox 64?
[0:27] <vurtual> ...remember it?
[0:27] <Skorchy> Uhm...
[0:27] <Serow> A 32 player game will be hell on a lot of computers anyway. XD

[0:27] <liq3> ouT|Phaze: actually normal limited maps have very little CPU strain. :/
[0:27] <Skorchy> Andddd apparently I have a TNT helmet
[0:27] <vurtual> big UFO, shoot the middle, lots of enemy ships?
[0:27] <Skorchy> Andddd this sounds like a bad idea.
[0:27] <vurtual> See also: The movie Independence Day
[0:27] <vurtual> one big shoutout
[0:27] <Serow> Awesome level.
[0:27] <liq3> ouT|Phaze: well for the severv anway.
[0:28] <silentangelix> I feel like playing some Warcraft II oddly enough
[0:28] <Synthpixel> I don't believe you're seeing this inf/inite idea correctly
[0:28] <Dommys> Skorchy
[0:28] <Dommys> Don't get hit in the head
[0:28] <Synthpixel> First of all, he said that /game/ will remain infinite while multiplayer will be finite
[0:28] <asiekierka> Guys
[0:28] <Synthpixel> As in, SP inf, MP finite
[0:28] <asiekierka> Ask one of the people who WERE in the test
[0:28] <Phil> no synth
[0:28] <silentangelix> Synth, notch plans for SP having limited maps as an option doesn't he
[0:28] <asiekierka> yes
[0:28] <asiekierka> yes Phil
[0:28] <asiekierka> because there are no infinite hard drives
[0:28] <Synthpixel> As an option, yes, he said that
[0:29] <Dommys> I have an infinite hard drive
[0:29] <Phil> yes but same goes for sp....
[0:29] <Synthpixel> asiekierka, you're so coy
[0:29] <Wolfeh> ZomBuster go in the test
[0:29] <Wolfeh> :D
[0:29] <ouT|Phaze> asiekierka: but even a gigabyte would be enough to host an infinite server
[0:29] <asiekierka> yes
[0:29] <asiekierka> but it wont go for long
[0:29] <ouT|Phaze> asiekierka: do you know how long it'd take to explore a gigabyte?
[0:29] <ouT|Phaze> it'd take forever
[0:29] <asiekierka> yes
[0:29] <ouT|Phaze> even with 32 players
[0:29] <Cat> asiekierka stop trolling
[0:29] <asiekierka> i have a terabyte for a server
[0:29] <asiekierka> :D
[0:29] <asiekierka> Cat stop trololing
[0:29] <ouT|Phaze> exactly
[0:29] <silentangelix> if you have more than 10 players a gig would go extremely fast
[0:29] <Phil> ive explored for DAYS and only gotten to 50mb before
[0:29] <Wolfeh> Cat isn't trolling -.-
[0:29] <Cat> how can i troll im a cat :3
[0:30] <Synthpixel> His reasoning for not making MP infinite is that it would be rather costly performance wise
[0:30] <Zenthos> with 32 players a gig would go in about 12 hours
[0:30] <Einherjar> Can anyone tell me if the boat elevator works with a mine cart?
[0:30] <asiekierka> yes
[0:30] <silentangelix> Phil, you're one person, imagine a lot of people building and destroying all at once, which stores more information, which makes a single gig go extremely fast.
[0:30] <Phil> well whos going to have 32 players...?
[0:30] <ouT|Phaze> and a server running a 32 player map prolly has much more than a gig on their computer
[0:30] <Einherjar> excellent
[0:30] <ouT|Phaze> or they are morons
[0:30] <Zenthos> I can explore about 10mb before I settle, but people will overlap
[0:30] <Synthpixel> Zenthos, In twelve hours I haven't been able to make more than 12mb
[0:30] <asiekierka> The ratio goes exponentially down

[0:30] <Zenthos> lemme do math
[0:30] <Phil> you're all idiots, or most of you
[0:30] <asiekierka> as in
[0:30] <asiekierka> the more of the map has been explored
[0:30] <asiekierka> the less the size will increase
[0:30] <esper_oldttz> yay! i'm an idiot!
[0:30] <Synthpixel> Hard drive space is no a concern
[0:30] <ouT|Phaze> asiekierka: yup
[0:30] <asiekierka> as new gamers will start in the already explored areas
[0:31] * knaelidos (seridon200@CPE-124-191-147-156.iqla1.woo.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[0:31] <asiekierka> so the ratio goes exponentially down
[0:31] <Zenthos> couple days then... but still
[0:31] <Synthpixel> Size of a chunk? 16x16x128
[0:31] <silentangelix> Lol, I love how we're explaining everything to him, and we're trying to make him see how fast a single gig can go and he calls us idiots XD
[0:31] <asiekierka> yes
[0:31] <Plinky> So in 12 hours a gig may be explored, but after that it will go down a lot.
[0:31] <asiekierka> let's assume a 2:1 ratio of compression
[0:31] <Phil> asiek, thats some serisouly flawed logic right there
[0:31] <ouT|Phaze> Zenthos: and you're still ignoring the fact that anyone running a 32 player game /better/ have more than a gig of space, anyway
[0:31] <asiekierka> 16kb per chunk
[0:31] <ouT|Phaze> otherwise they are idiot servers
[0:31] <asiekierka> Phil: Why
[0:31] <Phil> think about it....
[0:31] <Zenthos> well yea...
[0:31] <Phil> ill brb, then ill tell youi
[0:31] <Plinky> No
[0:31] <Serow> If you only have a gig of space, delete the damn porn.
[0:31] <Synthpixel> Each chunk should then be around 66kb
[0:32] <asiekierka> no
[0:32] <Plinky> That is perfect logic Phil.
[0:32] <sllide> trololololol
[0:32] <asiekierka> well maybe
[0:32] <silentangelix> Haha Serow nice
[0:32] <Zenthos> I have 900 gigs free on mine
[0:32] <ouT|Phaze> I was just using the gb as a point of reference
[0:32] <Plinky> The amount of exploration will decrease at a point.
[0:32] <Zenthos> which would be like... the size of the U.S. in MC
[0:32] <sllide> dude's your all missing the point
[0:32] <ouT|Phaze> if I ran a server, I'd have 2 spare terabytes I could set aside for infinite maps
[0:32] <silentangelix> In total i have only 120 gigs of space and all but like 31 of that is taken.
[0:32] <ouT|Phaze> that'd take at least a year to fill
[0:32] <ouT|Phaze> at /least/

[0:32] <Plinky> ouT|Phaze: The map would break before then.

[0:32] <ouT|Phaze> Plinky: probably, lol
[0:32] <Synthpixel> Say, 16 chunks a minute

[0:33] <Phil> yea lava
[0:33] <mnjiman> dam
[0:33] <Phil> sucks
[0:33] <Plinky> Synthpixel: Players might overlap too.
[0:33] <silentangelix> Phaze, not every single person has a 2TB HDD, so the people that don't would be f*cked if notch just made it have unlimited maps and they wanted to host a server.
[0:33] <Phil> i was almost finished coolecting...
[0:33] <Zenthos> yea
[0:33] <Wolfeh> Hey BlueWolf
[0:33] <Wolfeh> :D
[0:33] <Plinky> You need to take that into account.

[0:34] <mnjiman> its
[0:34] <mnjiman> possible..
[0:34] <Synthpixel> 32 megabytes a minute for a 32 player server of everyone exploring on their own in completely uncharted territory
[0:34] <Phil> no way
[0:34] <Phil> it was a pool
[0:34] <ouT|Phaze> silentangelix: people running a 32 player server /better/ have at least a couple hundred gigs of free space, or they are fail servers, and shouldn't be hosting 32 player games
[0:34] <Plinky> Worst case, say if 16 players were exploring on the top layer, and 16 on the bottom at an even speed?
[0:34] <Phil> of lava

[0:34] <mnjiman> lol
[0:34] <Phil> was spelunkan all night
[0:34] <Synthpixel> Plinky, Chunks aren't split on the z axis
[0:34] <Phil> to get that ore
[0:34] <silentangelix> Phaze, not everyone is gonna host a 32 player game, think of the people that wanna host a small 10 player game with friends, an unlimited map would still kill them
[0:34] <Phil> damn it...
[0:34] * knaelidos is now known as cynicalAlchemist

[0:35] <mnjiman> you see
[0:35] <mnjiman> its the same conversation over and over again
[0:35] <Synthpixel> within worst case scenario
[0:35] <ouT|Phaze> silentangelix: 10 people will take a long time to fill even a gb, and most smaller servers like that don't stay up for very long at a time
[0:35] <Synthpixel> and /no compression/
[0:35] <Phil> was that sped up or is that really how fast notch can load map?
[0:35] <Synthpixel> You'd make 2GB

[0:35] <silentangelix> yes but they would have to host that entire infinite map all at once, think about that
[0:35] <Zenthos> he rendered each frame 1 by 1
[0:35] <Synthpixel> (in one hour)
[0:35] <Plinky> Well Synth, I know that, but they would still explore on different axes.
[0:35] <mnjiman> to try to understand it even for a second,
[0:35] <Zenthos> he cannot generate that fast
[0:35] <mnjiman> you should just shoot yourself in the head
[0:35] <mnjiman> ill join you
[0:35] <Phil> thought so

[0:36] <Synthpixel> Meaning
[0:36] <Synthpixel> Everyone exploring completely flat land
[0:36] <Synthpixel> at top speed
[0:36] <Plinky> Having two parties would make it easy in some ways.

[0:37] <Zenthos> somewhere
[0:37] <vurtual> Star Fox 64 secretly had tons of references and shoutouts in it
[0:37] <TrueWolves> Hard drive space is still not an issue for most servers, what with a server setting being limiting the size of the map.
[0:37] <Zenthos> I know it was notch though
[0:38] <Synthpixel> Zenthos, It doesn't matter, that could be easily be brought down. You don't need to store 60mb of information per player

[0:38] <Zenthos> well no, if each player is in their own area, thats how large the chunks around them are
[0:38] <ouT|Phaze> TrueWolves: anyone running a server with infmaps turned on better have at least a couple hundred gigs, or they are horrible server hosts
[0:38] <JoesephJoestar> If a map was infinite, and there were many players...
[0:38] <TrueWolves> Maps /will/ be infinite unless the server says other wise.

[0:39] <TrueWolves> When he was in the channel talking about infinite maps and multiplayer about 4~5 weeks ago.
[0:40] <asiekierka> I dont think maps will go beyond 1Tb
[0:40] <sllide> lol
[0:40] <Plinky> sllide: Notch had a 334 mb map :P
[0:40] <Synthpixel> Yeah
[0:40] <asiekierka> before Alpha SMP is outdated
[0:40] <asiekierka> they wont
[0:40] <ouT|Phaze> yeah, I have a 40mb map
[0:40] <Plinky> 1gb is definitely possible.
[0:40] <ouT|Phaze> :3
[0:40] <sllide> sure it is
[0:40] <Synthpixel> When I heard him say it was limited, it was when he first started working on the MP client

[0:40] <TrueWolves> Synth, I think your missunderstanding "limited"
[0:40] <Zenthos> Cartograph is going to have to get some major updates...
[0:40] <sllide> but, i dont think players enjoy walking in random directions for atleast a few hours

[0:41] <TrueWolves> All servers will use infinte maps, however as a server setting for those worried about HardDrive space, you can set a limit to how large before the game stops generating further and just makes an edge like the current edges in creative mp are now.

[0:42] <BipolarWafflez> pretty sure nobody's going to talk that far, and pretty sure most people have a gig of free space
[0:42] <TrueWolves> Truely infinite multiplayer would be preaty easy for a dedicated modren server.

[0:43] <Plinky> large*
[0:43] <TrueWolves> Anyone who is running a minecraft server should have at least 10 free gigs, anyone who wants a true-blue infite server should have about a TB or two.
[0:43] <mnjiman> I think Synthpixel, we should even apply the fact that a game usually doesnt last more then 7 years anyways

[0:44] <Plinky> But if you are using a computer in general, 2gb, a server needs much more.
[0:44] <TrueWolves> If you some how got over a TB via greifers, you could very easily "cull" off un-used chunks and they'd gen back like normal when they were really going to be used.

[1:51] <sorre> i do hope we'll be able to import alpha maps on day one, though
[1:51] <Rawer> or else they don't love minecraft as much as we do :D
[1:51] <Psygo> the multiplayer will make it alot less scary I believe, but it'll still be fun
[1:51] <Rawer> Yeah
[1:51] <Genemos> The build up feels immense
[1:51] <Rawer> agreed
[1:51] <Genemos> lots of people going to get together

[1:52] <Genemos> I will be the rogue ninja, running around planting lava next to people

[1:52] <Genemos> Jar with lava next to you, hahaha!
[1:52] <sorre> you're gonna be on edge
[1:52] <Rawer> think if your building in a cavern and suddenly a player apears
[1:52] <Genemos> that would actually be really funny
[1:52] <Rawer> that wil make it very scary lol
[1:52] <Genemos> to ambush
[1:52] <Genemos> someone, by planting a lava spring behind them
[1:52] <xorcon> haha
[1:52] <sorre> actually, i'm hoping to work out a system that will protect my lair from intruders somewhat

[1:54] <sorre> argonians, yes
[1:54] <vurtual> ...of which females have boobs?

[1:54] <vurtual> with boobs
[1:54] <TrueWolves> ...
[1:54] <sorre> a sort of cross-server bridge
[1:54] <Rawer> Wow is actually a good game, but for the money, it's not worth it
[1:55] <Genemos> ahahahahaha, I just came up with an even better idea O.O
[1:55] <Xini> Yes
[1:55] <Rawer> if it was one time pay it wil be a better game
[1:55] <Psygo> I haven't touched wow since january 2009...
[1:55] <vurtual> ...now the real question is
[1:55] <Rawer> haha
[1:55] <Genemos> you go, 8 people, each with a bucket of lava, and plant them all around a player
[1:55] <Genemos> ohh
[1:55] <Genemos> the joy
[1:55] <Psygo> also rawer, they have server costs, they can't do that.
[1:55] <sorre> any of you who played Demon's Souls know what an awesomely scary thing black phantoms are
[1:55] <vurtual> does it annoy you enough to override your love for boobs?
[1:55] <Psygo> they could make it cheaper
[1:55] <Rawer> i know
[1:55] <Deepa> Psygo: they're considering to make it f2p
[1:55] <Rawer> yeah
[1:55] <Xini> no
[1:55] <xorcon> no of course not vurtual
[1:55] <TrueWolves> Why do the reptile people have mammary glands?
[1:55] <xorcon> jesus
[1:56] <Xini> reptile titties ftw
[1:56] <Rawer> they are getting millions
[1:56] <sorre> black phantoms scare me so much, i cross the street to avoid them
[1:56] <Rawer> arent that enought for those servers?
[1:56] <xorcon> the more big ol' titties the better
[1:56] <TrueWolves> Why?
[1:56] <Psygo> they can afford the servers for many years to come I think aswell lol
[1:56] <xorcon> the cats should have four tits though
[1:56] <TrueWolves> damn it furries >.-;
[1:56] <Rawer> yeah
[1:56] <TrueWolves> ...
[1:56] <vurtual> TrueWolves because the art creator liked boobs
[1:56] <Genemos> lol, you guys know that they have a decent profit from people who just buy the ordinary game :P

[1:56] <vurtual> Alternately ACCURATE ANATOMY
[1:56] <Psygo> eeeew runescape
[1:56] <Genemos> Runescape, ohh, the horror!
[1:57] <Rawer> haha
[1:57] <Xini> It's freaking magic in that game, anything can happen
[1:57] <vurtual> Then if you want some erotic overtone you can HAVE THIS BE DISCUSSED IND ETAIL
[1:57] <Rawer> Runescape is free, but it sucks
[1:57] <Xini> And cats have tits along with reptiles
[1:57] <Psygo> oh well I'm gonna go burn down some trees in the middle of the night wee
[1:57] <Xini> Good magic
[1:57] <Rawer> i don't have high standars but runescape? C'mon
[1:57] <xorcon> you can cast a spell that makes tits grow on your house
[1:57] <Xini> lol
[1:57] <xorcon> I love that game when that happened
[1:57] <vurtual> runescape hides under the guise of having lots of things to do
[1:57] <TrueWolves> Runescape, like many things on the internet, has a hatedom that refuse to understand that it's "Ok". Becuase most people would rather beleave something is either awesome or sucks completely.
[1:57] <Genemos> hmm, speaking of erotic overtone.... there must be someone, somewhere, that made a naked skin
[1:57] <vurtual> but in reality, all the unique fun stuff is from day one
[1:57] <vurtual> Genemos, plenty of them
[1:57] <Genemos> get a clan to all use them O.O
[1:57] <TrueWolves> Genemos, lots of them.
[1:57] <liq3> TrueWolves: Runescape isn't "OK"
[1:58] <Genemos> and then invade people's home
[1:58] <Psygo> oh god a zombie attacked me
[1:58] <vurtual> anyways runescape's lame and horrible

[1:58] <TrueWolves> liq3, provide facts behind what you say and I'll be much more willing to listen to arguements for either side.
[1:58] <liq3> TrueWolves: DoW2 is "ok". runescape isn't. -.-
[1:58] <vurtual> runescape is a game solely played by three distinct groups.
[1:58] <liq3> Runescape is a generic, grindy, boring, MMORPG, that has almost no skill involved.
[1:58] <Genemos> DoW?

[1:59] <Xini> You have to press potions like a pro in RuneScape
[1:59] <Rawer> haha
[1:59] <vurtual> Group one, idiot kids who have nothing better to do than lamely hit on girls
[1:59] <TrueWolves> ... That fits a lot of MMORPGs if you just use a guide to do the small amount of skill that they accualy take.

[1:59] <liq3> TrueWolves: And I hate most... well I don't know an MMORGP I don't hate.
[1:59] <liq3> :p
[1:59] <vurtual> group two, those one type of people
[1:59] <TrueWolves> For an MMORPG Runescape is "Ok"
[1:59] <liq3> Actually I don't hate Iron Realms games... but they're MUDs, not MMORPGs...
[1:59] <TrueWolves> better?
[1:59] <vurtual> absuardly stupid, but can use some weird disturbing uncanny valley version of good English
[1:59] <Genemos> any decent Minecraft servers up and running? Mostly just want to chill and look around
[1:59] <Xini> Many men online roleplaying girls = mmorpg
[1:59] <Rawer> Yeah, runescape is "fun"
[1:59] <Rawer> or it can be
[2:00] <liq3> TrueWolves: That's like saying "for a pile of shit, mule shit is "ok"".
[2:00] <vurtual> you hate these people the most
[2:00] <vurtual> and then the third group
[2:00] <TrueWolves> runescape can be, though it's more meh usualy.
[2:00] <xorcon> fun like a colonoscopy
[2:00] <xorcon> you have to be one of those guys to enjoy it
[2:00] <vurtual> lonely hentai addicts
[2:00] <Rawer> I don't play Runescape, it's old Very old..
[2:00] <TrueWolves> liq3, you clearly have a bias for MMORPGs, which makes convincing a lot harder. =/
[2:00] <liq3> Yep.
[2:00] <liq3> xD
[2:00] <Rawer> i play Minecraft, It's Awesome Very Awesome!
[2:00] <TrueWolves> MineCraft is very awesome indeed.
[2:00] <xorcon> minecraft sux play runescape
[2:01] <Psygo> DAMN PIGS RUNNING ON MY CROPS
[2:01] <Rawer> Haha
[2:01] <Genemos> lol, was about to make a your mum comment :P
[2:01] <Xini> If you don't think so, gtfo
[2:01] <sorre> well, there's little debating that MMORPG is a shit-tier genre
[2:01] <Xini> :>
[2:01] <sorre> it's barely even a game

[2:01] <carn> does anyone know if it's possible for your minecraft account to not have a password linked to it? lol

[2:02] <Xini> planting sunflowers like a freaking monster
[2:02] <TrueWolves> Runescape can be fun if played right (particularly with friends) but it's by defualt not... in reality a lot of things can be fun that are normaly just meh if done in certain ways, so this isn't any fact that supports it, just a general fact for any given game that isn't 100% terriable (Very few games are that bad... like... FATEL)

[2:02] <Roze> Heya vurtual!
[2:02] <SumWon> I haven't been here most of the day...Did I miss any cool updates?
[2:02] <vurtual> transform into your laptop, then sit next to your laptop.
[2:02] <TrueWolves> I bet 2/3rds of the people are going to only read the first 10~20 words of that.
[2:02] <liq3> TrueWolves: There is no way to play runescape right... and friends make EVERYTHING better, so it's not argument for it.
[2:02] <Deepa> carn: have you bought the game?
[2:03] <TrueWolves> And thus argue against me for something I accualy would argue for.
[2:03] <sorre> TEN!
[2:03] <Xini> FATEL?
[2:03] <sorre> TEN stacks of aspergite! Ah ah ah...
[2:03] <TrueWolves> Like what liq3 just did.
[2:03] <Xini> WHAT IS FATEL
[2:03] <SumWon> TrueWolves, much like DDO
[2:03] <vurtual> FATAL you say
[2:03] <liq3> I read the wholet hing -.-'
[2:03] <Genemos> carn: Send an e-mail to Notch? If you bought the game that is, then give him the info you bought it with or something?
[2:03] <SumWon> Playing by yourself, DDO is kinda boring
[2:03] <carn> Deepa: yeah, back in feb. still have the paypal id thing
[2:03] <vurtual> dinnerplate poopers.
[2:03] <vurtual> or whatever
[2:03] <SumWon> But I played it with my brother and it was really fun :D
[2:03] <Deepa> carn: then you could try mailing support
[2:03] <vurtual> no, there's no excuse.
[2:03] <carn> I tried emailing him on his support and other email account and no reply :/
[2:03] <TrueWolves> You missed the part where I said that wasn't an arguement for it. -.-
[2:03] <vurtual> Runescape is a horrbile, horrible disgrace, and unless you're desperate, playing it makes you a horrible person.
[2:03] <Psygo> arr
[2:03] <Psygo> pigs shall diew
[2:03] <SumWon> Lmao
[2:04] <Deepa> carn: which emails are that and how long ago was the email?
[2:04] <Wareya> I agree

[2:04] <Roze> Hah,
[2:04] * TrueWolves goes back to work, he doesn't want to debate for anything when all he gets is random bias with generic facts that fit way more then the debate in question.

[2:05] <Roze> They're charging to play there classics?
[2:05] <RavenBurga> I found mc when I was 12
[2:05] <carn> I just figured he was busy updating and whatnot
[2:05] <Deepa> With the release of RS2 they split RS Classic accounts

[2:05] <Nunu> lol? does playing runescape cost now? xD
[2:05] <RavenBurga> Yah
[2:05] <Deepa> Later on it was changed to only allow members to play Runescape classic
[2:05] <SumWon> What about Stellar Dawn? :D
[2:05] <RavenBurga> I'm 13
[2:05] <Deepa> Nunu: no. RS2 is free, classic costs
[2:05] <Xini> ok
[2:06] <Roze> That
[2:06] <Deepa> carn: the markus mail is the one that I got a reply on
[2:06] <Genemos> carn: That might help, it is understandable if you don't reach him on the normal e-mail
[2:06] <Roze> That
[2:06] <Roze> ...
[2:06] <SumWon> Stellar Dawn might be cool :D
[2:06] <Wareya> it's because classic is superior

[2:12] <Elf> So what language do I learn (I've done enough PHP and web dev for now): it's between Java and C# me thinks.
[2:12] <Roze> MURDER!
[2:12] <sorre> vista killed lots of things
[2:12] <Deepa> Wareya: I play games on my desktop
[2:12] <SumWon> Actually, Vista is particularily hard on HDDs
[2:12] <Wareya> Games don't count
[2:12] <SumWon> It pages them ALOT.
[2:12] <sorre> doesn't it do background indexing or something?
[2:12] <ranger10700> Elf, learn Java
[2:12] <sorre> yeah
[2:12] <ranger10700> just for now
[2:12] <Wareya> they're designed from the ground up to not have memory leaks
[2:12] <polan> Elf go for blitzmax!
[2:12] <sorre> ugh, paging
[2:12] <sorre> massive paging
[2:12] <SumWon> lol
[2:12] <BipolarWafflez> paging should not kill a harddrive
[2:12] <Elf> It doesn't really matter much as you can switch easily; but why'd you say Java ranger?
[2:12] <Rawer> on my desktop i have 3.40 dual core 4 gb Memory 1 tb Hdd 2000 mb GPU
[2:12] <Wareya> due to actor and frame execution
[2:13] <SumWon> Well, over the course of 2 and a half years it does :D
[2:13] <SumWon> Of constant running
[2:13] <Kodaichi> Learn java and you can port your code to mobile phones
[2:13] <BipolarWafflez> Maybe to a defected drive.
[2:13] <Deepa> Computer has been running for 20 days and it's still working just as fine as it did 20 days ago

[2:15] <Rawer> omg!!!
[2:15] <SumWon> I also have a really good memory lol
[2:15] <Deepa> I'm so secure in my sexuality that I can date people other than me

[2:35] <Wareya> we have structs
[2:35] <Elf> Well I'd like to do C++ as it seems the more professional option for proper game development, Java 'cause I'm already a web developer and integrating would be fun/easy, and C# because it's like Java but more modern and easier.
[2:35] <Deepa> I can use C if I want

[3:04] <Wareya> I'm worried that it might spit out C# or ASM
[3:04] <asiekierka> to ask for Cobol programmers
[3:04] <Wareya> just do java
[3:04] <Shadaez> Game dev? anything but JAVA
[3:04] <Wareya> it's what you got first
[3:04] <Elf> I chose Java over PHP 5 years ago
[3:04] <Elf> PHP over Java*
[3:04] <Wareya> java is actualyl really god for game dev
[3:04] <Wareya> actually*
[3:04] <Elf> the third hat pick reveals: C#!
[3:04] <asiekierka> a Polish company from 2006 was offering COBOL courses, what the
[3:04] <Shadaez> not really
[3:04] <asiekierka> COBOL COURSES
[3:04] <asiekierka> IN 2006
[3:04] <asiekierka> WHAT THE
[3:04] <Wareya> compared to everythign else out there?
[3:04] <Wareya> (aside from GML of course)
[3:04] <Elf> So far
[3:05] <Wareya> (GML is awesome objects)
[3:05] <Elf> C#: 1, C++: 1, Java: 1
[3:05] <Elf> C~ 2
[3:05] <Elf> C#2*
[3:05] <Shadaez> C# I'd say
[3:05] <Wareya> C# is terrible
[3:05] <asiekierka> oh please, i'm learning cobol now
[3:05] <Wareya> no, really
[3:05] <Wareya> it's terrible
[3:05] <asiekierka> just so i can undertake such offer
[3:05] <Elf> and C++
[3:05] <Elf> IT'S A DRAW BETWEEN C++ and C#!
[3:05] <pekuja> Wareya: how many significant programs have you written in C#?
[3:05] <asiekierka> and ask "pay me big as i'm the only !@#$ing person who still knows cobol"
[3:05] <Wareya> C++
[3:05] <Elf> This means I must pick 5 more out of the hat
[3:05] <Wareya> pekuja: ten
[3:05] <Foe|Bit> Why did i even decide to join this channel at this time...

[3:06] <Deepa> Elf: Python is a nice language for web development
[3:06] <Wareya> do C++ man
[3:06] <Elf> I don't want web dev, I have PHP all dandy
[3:06] <Wareya> deepa: it's funny because it's true
[3:06] <pekuja> Wareya: if you only spent an average of three days on each, I can hardly believe that those were very significant pieces of software
[3:06] <Deepa> Wareya: it's the main reason I'm learning Python :-)
[3:06] <Elf> C++ 3
[3:06] <Wareya> pekuja: I am a very good programmer.
[3:06] <Wareya> just do C++
[3:06] <Elf> Why may I ask
[3:07] <Wareya> as much as I hate it I don't want you to do C#
[3:07] <Elf> I might go with Java
[3:07] <Elf> as it's the first I picked
[3:07] <Wareya> because C# will ruin any possible chance to make good procedural code
[3:07] <Elf> oh my, C# came out again
[3:07] <Elf> I don't actually know what I'm doing
[3:07] <Elf> I've lost track
[3:07] <Elf> I'm just gonna start again and go with the first
[3:07] <Wareya> do java or C++
[3:07] <Elf> okie lemme remove C and C# then
[3:07] <Wareya> or C

[3:08] <Wareya> C>else
[3:08] <Deepa> But ASM is hard without experience
[3:08] <asiekierka> they were offering free courses for COBOL in 2007
[3:08] <asiekierka> in Poland
[3:08] <Wareya> I hack Mips assembly
[3:08] <Wareya> it's easy
[3:08] <Wareya> http://z64.spinout182.com/index.php?topic=66.msg341#msg341
[3:08] <Deepa> I don't have a MIPS to try it out on
[3:08] <Wareya> it's like it's totally C
[3:08] <Elf> java
[3:08] <Wareya> N64 emulators
[3:08] <Elf> well java seems to always come out first
[3:09] <Wareya> lol
[3:09] <Elf> and I was going to choose it 5 years ago but didn't

[3:09] <pekuja> there's no need to learn Assembly for game programming. C is a good baseline though
[3:09] <cosh> asm will defeat you
[3:09] <Wareya> C is terrible for game programing due to how its gay structures work
[3:09] <Wareya> I do not like C structuers
[3:09] <asiekierka> Read says Columbia Insurance?s policy management and claims processing software is 20 years old and has 1 million lines of Cobol code with some 3,000 modifications layered on over the years.

[3:09] <pekuja> Wareya: yeah I'm not saying you should write whole games in C

[3:14] <Elf> Look there's no point about arguing which is the best language, I have succesfully figured that it depends on your personality and opinion in most cases; but I've finally come to choose the holy language Java
[3:14] <Phil> notch said he added them

[3:22] <Dommys> I got some awesome news today. My cousin is moving out of state, and she has a house. I think I got a new place to live! yahoo! and none of you care!
[3:22] <pekuja> the rules and principles that govern the sentence structure of any individual language
[3:22] <Kyto> np: M.I.A. - Paper Planes
[3:22] <Wareya> ...what?
[3:22] <Wareya> that makes no sense
[3:22] <pekuja> of course that's regarding natural languages
[3:22] <Wareya> okay
[3:22] <Dommys> Kyto: Sticks and Stones and Weed and Bones?
[3:22] <pekuja> but the question is not about what things are named, but more about what sort of syntax is used to represent relationships and operations between them
[3:23] <Kyto> ye
[3:23] <Wareya> can you link me to like, some normal C# code?

[3:23] <Kyto> or is it bombs
[3:23] <Kyto> dunno :P
[3:23] <Dommys> Never thought of that one
[3:23] <Wareya> C# syntax is about as far from C syntax as Java is
[3:23] <pekuja> Wareya: not really. you could probably find some on google code search or something
[3:23] <pekuja> Wareya: yeah
[3:23] <Dommys> I long for a "Always Sunny" switch on Minecraft
[3:23] <pekuja> of course there are differences
[3:23] <Wareya> pekuja: That's really, really far.
[3:24] <Wareya> too far to call C# a C language
[3:24] <Dommys> Give me back paradise, notch!! give it back!!
[3:24] <Wareya> I mean, it's derivative and all
[3:24] <exe> but syntax is only improved
[3:24] <Wareya> (not that being derivative is bad with coding)
[3:24] <Wareya> I think that the syntax is ass rapes upside down.
[3:24] <pekuja> they've basically taken C syntax and added stuff on top
[3:24] <Wareya> raped*
[3:24] <pekuja> in that sense it is similar
[3:25] <Wareya> that's like saying that eating ice cream is like drinking milk.
[3:25] <Elf> So what's the secret friday update going to be then
[3:25] <pekuja> I'm not sure you understand what "syntax" means.
[3:25] <Wareya> I do.
[3:25] <Wareya> It's a bad metaphor, but it's sitll valid.

[3:31] <Kodaichi> anyway gtg
[3:31] <Wareya> Really simple changes, without hitting the level of (bullshit) that C++ does?
[3:31] <Wareya> 1 sec
[3:31] <pekuja> what's a "C dialect" anyhow? C, C99, etc?
[3:32] <pekuja> I wouldn't call C++ a dialect of C
[3:32] <Wareya> C++ is about as far as I'd call a dialect
[3:32] <Wareya> since it's so similar

[4:07] <Plinky> Yeah, caused a ruckus pinging Mithril a yesterday.
[4:07] <Bearodactyl> that is how argumentation works
[4:07] <Quatroking> If I had to ban for that reason I'd have to ban the entire channel for constantly pinging notch
[4:07] <Quatroking> honestly
[4:07] <TotempaaltJ> Ah well. Let's get back to MC.
[4:07] <Plinky> Lemme get the log.
[4:07] <Bearodactyl> yeah Mithril, gosh
[4:08] <Mithril> Yeah, but they ping notch about the game, he pings me for trolling
[4:08] <Bearodactyl> trolls deserve it]
[4:08] <Zuriki> Quatro, your reasoning sucks.
[4:08] <Bearodactyl> I'd expect to be constantly pinged when I troll
[4:08] <Deepa> Quatroking: some of us did not ping Mithril to harass
[4:08] <Bearodactyl> but not when I craft a beautiful game for you guys
[4:08] <Dommys> Quatro, not me. I never spell nothc correctly.
[4:08] <Quatroking> Just read a few lines back

[4:19] <Blackthorn> lol
[4:19] <Wareya> Tor doesn't work on esper, efnet, or freenode
[4:19] <Quatroking> LG_Legacy, this guy Tribearatops is a troll
[4:19] <janger> Who here knows code your so lucky
[4:19] <Quatroking> just changed his IP

[4:21] <Tribearatops> lol, honestly, I don't think I've discussed anything but how unfair me being banned is. That's hardly trolling.
[4:21] <Deages> akick is usually reserved for super ops (& also refered to as admin) in standard IRC configurations. might be different here though quat.

[4:38] <Quatroking> vede: might as well make use of it
[4:38] <Quatroking> gompasta, too much
[4:38] <Pixel> What is-
[4:38] <Pixel> ...
[4:38] <Emphursis> How much did you jizz yourself when you connected to the server?
[4:38] <Quatroking> so much I even have MSN contacts spamming me while I haven't seen them in years
[4:38] <Sturmeh> anyone got a way to fullscreen the alpha? night contrast with my desktop is making my eyes bleed

[4:38] <Snowman> A type of fish
[4:38] <Rawer> Quatroking, what does Notch mean with this? : I???ve seen some people sharing older versions of the client
[4:38] <Pixel> Oh
[4:38] <Pixel> I thought it was caps
[4:39] <ColdFusion> I tought f11 worked in game
[4:39] <Pixel> xD
[4:39] <asiekierka> Rawer: Zuriki's RetroCraft
[4:39] <Sturmeh> oh it does?
[4:39] <asiekierka> the point is
[4:39] <asiekierka> Zuriki asked in mid-June
[4:39] <Pixel> I thought it was an acronym of some sorts
[4:39] <asiekierka> Notch replied in mid-July, and not even directly
[4:39] <Sturmeh> thanks ColdFusion loool
[4:39] <Quatroking> rawer: people sharing alpha versions
[4:39] <DDRJake> what was that game where you're a little flower going back and fourth through time? it's a creepy 2d-playformer?
[4:39] <Rawer> oh
[4:39] <Sturmeh> Quatroking it doesn't have mp not to worry, it will just make them lust for the real thing
[4:39] <Sturmeh> :P
[4:39] <Pixel> What's different at all in gameplay in MP
[4:39] <DDRJake> eversion, got it
[4:40] <Quatroking> that didn't make sense at all sturmeh
[4:40] <gompasta> Have you killed notch on MP? :D
[4:40] <Sturmeh> <_<
[4:40] <vede> A lot of people seem to be under the impression that SMP was functional enough to actually be a satisfying experience, but it was basically like Creative is now, with a bigger map (technically infinite but exploring new terrain caused ridiculous lagfreezes for everyone on the server), and a bunch of half-features that kinda worked but if you didn't know what they were supposed to be, you'd probably think they were bugs like any other bug.
[4:40] <Quatroking> No, I only killed ez

[4:40] <gompasta> Aw now that is j.. wait there is PVP? :S
[4:40] <Quatroking> about 10
[4:41] <Sturmeh> ColdFusion u know how to make Steam like minecraft?
[4:41] <Quatroking> that is including Notch and ez
[4:41] <Snowman> Ah, k, all oldbies I guess?
[4:41] <ColdFusion> Sturmeh no i dont
[4:41] <asiekierka> I am not sure
[4:41] <Onforty> ez is Elin?
[4:41] <asiekierka> I think one or two weren't oldbies
[4:41] <Quatroking> all veterans and personal contacts of notch
[4:41] <Bakkaratorz> As i recall, tribes 2 had an infinite world spawner when you went beyond the confines of the battle area... how'd they remedy that
[4:41] <Snowman> Ah, k
[4:41] <asiekierka> Oh
[4:41] <Deepa> Sturmeh: doesn't just giving steam the .exe work?
[4:41] <Deepa> Bakkaratorz: it does
[4:41] <vede> And unless you were remotely close to the server, watching other people walk around was more like watching people do a weird teleporting thing from wherever they were to wherever they wanted to go.
[4:41] <Quatroking> Bakkaratorz, tribes 2 code pls
[4:41] <Deepa> Quatroking: buy Torque

[4:42] <Bakkaratorz> so this is the place to go to play

[4:43] <Maart3h> :)
[4:43] <Plinky> I know little about this issue.
[4:43] <Pixel> And also
[4:43] <Dman757> Quatroking, I don't know if you would know but are there different difficulty settings for server owners?
[4:43] <Quatroking> Zuriki, I think its either aimed at pirates pirating alpha, or its you.
[4:44] <Plinky> I know there is more than one retro server though.
[4:44] <Pixel> What happens if Notch is grumpy? xD
[4:44] <Banger> hey folks

[4:44] <Zuriki> He didn't address me directly and he brought it up publicly
[4:44] <Dman757> k
[4:44] <Plinky> And old versions etc.
[4:44] <gompasta> Yes zuriki, it is aimed at you.. =p
[4:44] <Pixel> Seems like something the hulk would say
[4:44] <epaGamer> theres plenty version of minecraft on TPB
[4:44] <Zuriki> Rather than PMing me on the forums or emailing me or twittering me
[4:44] <epaGamer> versions*
[4:44] <Quatroking> zuriki did you ask him directly
[4:44] <Pixel> Except an older hulk
[4:44] <Quatroking> before doing all that stuff
[4:44] <Zuriki> I asked him in two places
[4:44] <Plinky> I need a twitter.
[4:44] <Zuriki> Email and twitter
[4:44] <Zuriki> He didn't reply to either.
[4:45] <Pixel> He's mad at you
[4:45] <Emphursis> From the comments, it seemed that other people were doing it as well, so it may not have been entirely aimed at you
[4:45] <Quatroking> then again he invited you yesterday
[4:45] <epaGamer> what did you do zuriki?
[4:45] <Pixel> Obviously
[4:45] <Quatroking> its probably just some pirates
[4:45] <Pixel> Zuriki slept with ez
[4:45] <epaGamer> omg
[4:45] <Pixel> Wait a second
[4:45] <Pixel> E-z
[4:45] <epaGamer> cant be

[4:45] <ColdFusion> I think stealing from a indie developer is sort of cheap. But looking at the "Player purshed number" It starts looking like notch has enoug money
[4:45] <Zuriki> You know how wrong that would be.
[4:45] <Zuriki> I'm 17
[4:45] <Zuriki> Ez is what?
[4:45] <Zuriki> Late 20s
[4:45] <Quatroking> ColdFusion, you can never have enough money
[4:45] <Plinky> Actually Zuriki, I think it is less aimed at you, because you asked in the past and only proceeded, but was willing to pull it down if needed. Non?
[4:45] <Zuriki> 27/28/29
[4:46] <Pixel> Well you're legal in some countries
[4:46] <Elf> What have you done, |uriki?
[4:46] <Quatroking> Zuriki, I'm 16, but that doesn't mean I don't want to jump in bed with Eva Wyrwal

[5:01] <RagamuffinJoe> he PM's them over IRC
[5:01] <Emphursis> Like a giant robot 20 blocks high and 7 wide than crushes blocks beneath it's feet as Notch's revenge for distributing the client

[5:09] <gompasta> =p
[5:09] <Deepa> Quatroking is the people person of this channel
[5:09] <Willerin> thats like being pushed into your own piss
[5:10] <Pixel> wat
[5:10] <Elf> How can you swim out anyway?
[5:10] <Elf> And even if they did
[5:10] <Deepa> Willerin: nooooot quite
[5:10] <Pixel> No it's like being pushed into your own breast milk
[5:10] <Elf> They'd be rejected by all other cows
[5:10] <Elf> For being a smelly cow
[5:10] <shairn> kinda like swimming in breastmilk. Not necessarily humiliating(maybe a fetish of some sort?) but kinda weird
[5:10] <Pixel> If you're a woman atleast
[5:10] <Willerin> what if we dont give breast milk.
[5:10] <Pelum> i wouldnt mind swimming in breasts
[5:10] <Elf> And they'd be ashamed of their milky-substances being leaked all over their body, and walk away in shame to hide in a cave and be eaten by one of those spiders
[5:10] <shairn> err
[5:10] <gompasta> I kinda wish i never said that, now.
[5:10] <Deepa> Pelum: MOOBS :EEEE
[5:10] <shairn> I prefer my breasts to be attached to women, not standalone
[5:10] <Pixel> This chat is turning
[5:10] <Willerin> They'd either be ashamed or deeply aroused
[5:10] <shairn> that would be creepy

[5:11] <Pelum> or slowly turn white so you know they have milk in them
[5:11] <Pelum> >__>
[5:11] <RagamuffinJoe> erm
[5:12] <RagamuffinJoe> this is
[5:12] <Deepa> That's a nice idea actually
[5:12] <RagamuffinJoe> kind of a dirty chat.
[5:12] <Pixel> Or better yet
[5:12] <shairn> I don't think Notch will make milk placeable I mean after all, a cow does NOT provide a river of milk
[5:12] <Pixel> Make them stop mooing
[5:12] <Willerin> If milk could spread like water I'd make a giant bowel, fill it with milk and put two of every mob in it and call it "Noahs Breastmilk: IRC edition"
[5:12] <gompasta> Yeah. lets talk about... iron ingots or something.
[5:12] <Pelum> butt 500cows do shairn

[5:12] <Pixel> When you milk em so I don't have to listen to the same song and dance

[5:12] <shairn> well one bucket would be one cow
[5:12] <RagamuffinJoe> iron ingots suck#
[5:12] <Elf> Yes but if you milk many cows?
[5:12] <shairn> you get an infinite milk spring?
[5:12] <Elf> He could just make the water white and make the distance it travels 1 square or something
[5:13] <Elf> So you basically have 1 bucket of milk for 1 tile
[5:13] <Elf> and small spread
[5:13] <Willerin> if he made water white it'd make the dick structures 100 times more interesting
[5:13] * Ninto (Ninto@86.48.58.18) has joined #minecraft
[5:13] <Elf> Then we could make huge milk factories

[5:13] <shairn> that would be creepy since instead of shooting out it oozes out
[5:13] <gompasta> I think milk should spread like water, but wont clone.

[5:14] <Willerin> kids going through puberty often have it 'ooze' out.

[5:18] <Willerin> wouldnt they go extinct or evolve not to explode

[6:35] <BipolarWafflez> what if someone breaks it inside =(
[6:35] <TheOne> Till it burns down your base
[6:35] <Mithril> SDL sucks.....
[6:36] <Zuriki> For example, Dolphin emu performs much better in DX than OGL mode.
[6:36] <Quatroking> theone, not if you build the walls from stone
[6:36] <Dat_Earpice> I only use openGL because i dont want to have anything to do with the windows API. other then that i think DirectX is better especialy 11&12
[6:36] <vede> Zuriki, when you're in the mood to kick cross-platform compatibility in the nuts, sure, it's better.

[6:45] <Wildstyle> though Mac is getting better then it used to be
[6:45] <BipolarWafflez> Windows isn't dying, its being used more than ever before. It's just that there's more variety of less popular OSes now.

[7:28] <Demki> then what is it?
[7:28] <RavenBurga> I can has?
[7:28] <Ninto> XOR = exclusive OR
[7:28] <RagamuffinJoe> OW JESUS CHRIST LAVA
[7:28] <SireTRM> Remember, Jehutus, the saves are specific to each computer, and possibly domain. www.minecraft.net vs. minecraft.net

[7:28] <Viral> SireTRM, no.
[7:29] <Ninto> exclusive = opposite of inclusive
[7:29] <alphaq> I'd say that inclusive XOR would be OR.
[7:29] <Viral> they save to the HDD
[7:29] <vede> RavenBurga, you clearly did not spend enough time on Wikipedia.
[7:29] <Viral> but domain specific? that's stupid
[7:29] <Ninto> So when you say "inclusive XOR" you say "inclusive exclusive or" :P

[7:35] <Outpost> An indie game ISN'T.

[7:35] <Deepa> I know several indie developers who are trying to get a shitton of money
[7:35] <RavenBurga> And people paying 0.01 for the indie bundle

[12:10] <Quatroking> you should've seen it yesterday
[12:10] <asiekierka> DOWNTIME
[12:10] <Sr_Creeper> Quatroking, are you excited for the next test?
[12:10] <nupanick> anyone know how to use milk?
[12:10] <nupanick> I can't get it to work
[12:10] <Kookee> ok then
[12:10] <Nahob> get bucket
[12:10] <Uncreative_> asiekierka: It's not going to be just one server. People will host their own servers. :\
[12:10] <Nahob> then dirnk bucket
[12:10] <xRDVx> nupanick: you got milk?
[12:10] <Dommys> TrueWolves use +m atrix mode to read it S-L-O-W-E-R
[12:10] <Unrealomega> nupanick: You put it into a glass and drink it.
[12:10] <Quatroking> Sr_Creeper, sure
[12:10] <TrueWolves> I already had a headache Quatro, the channel seems to be making it wrose.
[12:10] <nupanick> yeah but I can't drink it
[12:10] <asiekierka> Uncreative_ Im not talking about the SMP server
[12:10] <RagamuffinJoe> guyyss
[12:10] <nupanick> glass?
[12:10] <asiekierka> but the minecraft.net server
[12:10] <boyofcheese> WOOT got 37 more redstone
[12:10] <Uncreative_> asiekierka: Oh. I dunno, I think it can handle it.
[12:10] <RagamuffinJoe> what does slime do?
[12:10] <nupanick> you can make a glass?
[12:10] <Unrealomega> nupanick: Yep. Check your cabinets.
[12:10] <nupanick> I'll try...
[12:10] <asiekierka> Uncreative_ It already crashed 5 times or so
[12:10] <asiekierka> in history
[12:10] <Uncreative_> asiekierka: Well, shit
[12:10] <Nahob> You should be able to fish ~! Every time you scoop up the water with your bucket theres a random chance there will be a little fishy in there !

[12:11] <nupanick> and notch has said that he wants fish yes
[12:11] <Kookee> Quatro: exactly how large does notch think that a server population can handle, once the base coding is stable?
[12:11] <Unrealomega> nupanick: Oh, put it into a bowl.
[12:11] <RagamuffinJoe> sand + furnace = glass
[12:11] <Unrealomega> nupanick: Milk on top, bowl below it.
[12:11] <Quatroking> Kookee, hardware-based I think
[12:11] <Dommys> fish + furnace = stinky furnace.
[12:11] <Quatroking> also
[12:11] <nupanick> ...nothing happened :(
[12:11] <RagamuffinJoe> it needs coal or wood in
[12:11] <RagamuffinJoe> as a fuel
[12:11] <Quatroking> I bet that the slimes have a secret attack in which tentacles appear
[12:11] <RagamuffinJoe> aswell
[12:11] <Quatroking> and your player gets RAPED
[12:11] <RagamuffinJoe> ew

[12:12] <slowriot> Quatroking: what do we have to do to get an invite? ;)
[12:12] <Sr_Creeper> Quatroking, there's already rule 34 on creepers, such as creeper bondage.
[12:12] <RagamuffinJoe> tiny slimes form into big slimes
[12:12] <KillingSpree> Dragoon : Yes
[12:12] <RagamuffinJoe> which make more tiny slimes

[12:49] <nilzero> I don't understand why you people want the code for a buggy test phase instead of patiently waiting for the functional finished version. But whatever.

[12:51] <TrueWolves> <Notch> yes, you all in the channel will be the first to test SMP, I'd be on here a lot more if it wasn't a time sink| I'll pick people at random with a slight bias towards names I know and ops.
[12:52] <MisterRoo> use those bows and arrows on slimes

[12:52] <Quatroking> I said the current testers were either veterans or notch's personal contacts
[12:52] <xRDVx> Serow: do you see a new update?
[12:52] <Ecthel> I heard that was a bug, yes
[12:52] <C418> nothing much else
[12:52] <Dokudoku> yes serow has the client updated since secret update 6
[12:52] <Antique> "When 4chan comes here"

[13:03] <cce> iji is ugly :(
[13:03] <C418> I keep telling people, there is only one code. if you happen to find the code out, you will be greeted by nothing at all. and by notch, who notices your joining and changes the code. I don't think it's easy to tell that to 4chan

[13:04] <Uncreative_> KillingSpree: It's fun when you first start
[13:04] <pimpmasta> Minecraft should be available on steam. That would be fucking epic.
[13:04] <C418> well, we have to expect that the userbase of minecraft is huge

[13:04] <Uncreative_> KillingSpree: Then it begins to become boring
[13:04] <TrueWolves> It is a closed beta, but with how the community is, hving it secret would make people compalign that there are no updates on the MP survival.
[13:04] <KillingSpree> Uncreative_ 1-35 is alright, then you have to repeat the story

[14:34] <ColdFusion> bambo can grow unlmited long you just need water next to it
[14:34] <Kyar> they aren't

[15:10] <Moriachik> If they don't land in water Kom
[15:11] <Kom> I thought it was horizontal speed that brought about a boat's demise.
[15:11] <Moriachik> Only if it hits land lol

[15:26] <KillingSpree> talking about bamboo
[15:27] <SireTRM> We need the ability to turn mob spawning on/off. Notch has confirmed it won't happen.
[15:27] <Namzo> rofl
[15:27] <SireTRM> KillingSpree, you don't make bamboo into paper.
[15:27] <Soviet> i will send Notch this pic http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/9634/fffuuu.jpg
[15:27] <Rooster> Talking about something in a different thread because we have to keep all of one huge update in a single thread.
[15:27] <Gunmage> How did someone get a giant slime?
[15:27] <KillingSpree> Sire
[15:27] <SireTRM> Papyrus is the original "paper" thing that grows by water.
[15:27] <Soviet> mob spawning on/off ? i just lock the door
[15:27] <Kitoari> siretrm: wasn't it called peaceful mode
[15:27] <KillingSpree> Was relating the threads
[15:27] <Gunmage> http://i31.tinypic.com/504dwl.jpg
[15:27] <KillingSpree> Wasn't actually calling it bamboo.
[15:28] <KillingSpree> Gunmage
[15:28] <KillingSpree> have you played that boss?
[15:28] <KillingSpree> it's too hard
[15:28] <SireTRM> Kitoari, no, like saying "don't spawn *any* of [mob]"
[15:28] <KillingSpree> that giant
[15:28] <Gunmage> no
[15:28] <KillingSpree> splits into 5 huge
[15:28] <Kitoari> ah

[15:29] <KillingSpree> Ones that big aren't possible
[15:29] <KillingSpree> the one that that giant one breaks into
[15:29] <KillingSpree> is the largest size
[15:29] <Gunmage> They cant form together into one?

[15:30] <Rooster> Notch is gay for Quatroking
[15:30] <Rooster> It's the only logical explanation.
[15:30] <Namzo> .
[15:30] <geraldbrent> NOOO

[15:32] <treefish> i think the thing i'm most impressed of about minecraft is that it's done in java
[15:33] <KillingSpree> I wish it wasn't in java
[15:33] <KillingSpree> It would run 10x better
[15:33] <KillingSpree> if it wasn't
[15:33] <SireTRM> Java makes it multiplatform native easily.
[15:33] <Brotagonist> I can't find anything about clay... where to find it and such?
[15:33] <KillingSpree> Ik
[15:33] <KillingSpree> But
[15:33] <KillingSpree> It
[15:33] <SireTRM> Brotagonist, look around sand.
[15:33] <Brotagonist> Alrighty.
[15:33] <KillingSpree> 's annoying quite honestly, that java uses so much cpu sometimes
[15:33] <Brotagonist> Thank ya.
[15:33] <Brotagonist> Get an i7
[15:33] <Brotagonist> :D
[15:33] <Namzo> to make you feel better i have not found any either ;)
[15:34] <cce> pentium 4 goes mad with minecraft!
[15:34] <treefish> KillingSpree: what are you doing that drives your cpu so hard?
[15:34] <SireTRM> Minecraft.

[15:34] <Kodaichi> I saw one that grew up through a tree

[15:34] <cce> KillingSpree: :D
[15:34] * CialDS is now known as Cial
[15:34] <treefish> depends on the jvm
[15:34] <SireTRM> I'm pretty sure.
[15:34] <cce> i think it uses opengl in minecraft
[15:34] <Namzo> i know nothing about this
[15:34] <Gunmage> hmm
[15:35] <treefish> if he's using awt then it depends on the jvm im pretty sure
[15:35] <exe> rendering graphics does not take much cpu

[15:36] <Kodaichi> also it seems papyrus can grow in big clumps
[15:36] <Gunmage> The lighthouse is making cave sounds
[15:36] <Kodaichi> found 5 plants all next to eachother
[15:36] <Gunmage> XD

[15:36] <Gunmage> Huzzah!
[15:36] <Chezhead> ON TV, they said "Top notch" and I immeditly thought of Notch. Am I too obsessed?
[15:37] <DimJim> no
[15:37] <Boyofcheese> No
[15:37] <_phil> Yes
[15:37] <Namzo> guys look at this
[15:37] <Cial> im on my DSi!
[15:37] <DimJim> you're too obsessed when your dreams are about minecraft
[15:37] <DimJim> like me!

[15:37] <GMP> hey team
[15:37] <GMP> how do I empty milk buckets
[15:37] <SireTRM> teh lulz. Putting a cactus on under your spawn.
[15:37] <Namzo> http://uploads.mibbit.com/bEQ0bG.png
[15:37] <Chezhead> Dimjim Most of my dreams have real life things, but take place in things I've made or generated in minecraft
[15:38] <Chezhead> Do you know what would be annoying? you know how spawns will be in the same place and you can't change them? Couldn't people just put lava or something under the spawn?
[15:38] <Namzo> http://uploads.mibbit.com/bRoQYf.png
[15:38] <Namzo> its this huge floating land mass
[15:38] <HaoWard> Floating islands are cool; they remind me of asteroids
[15:39] <_phil> there was something about restricting any build-related activities in the spawn zones of players
[15:39] <_phil> so i guess that wont be an issue

[15:41] <vurtual> I spot a suepr-high defended structure, and decide to attack it.

[15:41] <KillingSpree> are you actally playing
[15:41] <KillingSpree> actually*
[15:41] <vurtual> I have no planning, no sepcial weapons to deal with this, and am mostly screwed.

[15:42] <vurtual> then proceed to toss charges while two massive anti-tank lasers fire at me
[15:42] <vurtual> I end up demolishing most of the base, and fighting off a huge amount of soldiers, including some by tossing a charge at my feet
[15:42] <vurtual> Then, when I apparently get very little for blowing up these buildings, I decide to scout out the area more. But there's giant guns.
[15:42] <_phil> so it just has to be hardcoded into the game, that lets say 10x10x128 blocks around that spawn are indestructable and there cant be build in that area. problem solved
[15:42] <GMP> mine saved.

[15:43] <Stealez> to understanddd
[15:43] <_phil> if u like source games
[15:43] <Chezhead> TO KILL THEM IS MY REAL QUEST

[15:44] <Namzo> ok what do cave noises sound like
[15:44] <Namzo> because
[15:44] <Namzo> i just turned sound on for the first time

[15:45] <SireTRM> How tall does papyrus grow? 3?
[15:45] <Uncreative_> NO
[15:45] <Cial> vurtual,sounds like a fettish
[15:45] <vurtual> fetish
[15:46] <Cial> sorry
[15:46] <vurtual> wether you pronounce it like a bounty hunter or not
[15:46] <Cial> typing on my DS
[15:46] <Cial> pain in the ass
[15:46] <vurtual> naturally RF:G is amazingly unbalanced if you can deal with the recoil of the pistol, making it into an infinite range precision weapon.
[15:46] <DimJim> papyrus should have infinite growth
[15:46] <PrincepsRegulus> no, it shouldnt :P
[15:46] <DimJim> just take longer to grow per stalk length
[15:46] <GMP> http://glua.net/temp/terror.bmp ;_;
[15:46] <DimJim> so if you wait an hour you'll have tower of papper
[15:47] <vurtual> Mob and the papyrusstalk?
[15:47] <PrincepsRegulus> but that makes no sense
[15:47] <PrincepsRegulus> at all
[15:47] <DimJim> gmp: you're one of the guys that runs glua?
[15:47] <Cial> i havent gotten to test the new features yet :(
[15:47] <Rooster> Horses should be next update.
[15:47] <PrincepsRegulus> they should
[15:48] <Cial> ehhh :/
[15:48] <Namzo> so slimes spawn on peaceful?
[15:48] <PrincepsRegulus> although everyone hoping it'll be smp
[15:48] <Namzo> do they attack?
[15:48] <PrincepsRegulus> obviously
[15:48] <SireTRM> Exponential growth rates for tall papyrus?
[15:48] <PrincepsRegulus> yes namzo
[15:48] <PrincepsRegulus> they do
[15:48] <Kitoari> I'm guessing smp in two weeks
[15:48] <SireTRM> Quite unfortunately, Namzo
[15:48] <Namzo> that needs to be fixed
[15:48] <Namzo> i have not met any yet
[15:48] <GMP> DimJim: the only one :3
[15:48] <PrincepsRegulus> im hoping not smp in 2 weeks

[16:49] <Sr_creeper> This weeks friday update is the japan biome
[16:49] <Genemos> lol
[16:49] <SireTRM> ouT|Phaze, it's considered papyrus, considering it's use in paper.
[16:49] <ouT|Phaze> true
[16:49] <Genemos> my room smells like a barn now, I hate this cat... horrible thing.... :@
[16:50] <Sr_creeper> I call it the japan biome because of reeds, and slimes

[16:50] <ZarroTsu> 3 papyrus -> 3 paper -> 1 book (I really don't get why the paper transition is so clean cut)

[16:51] <Roadcrosser> How do you get bookcases :/
[16:52] <Sr_creeper> # wood, 3 book, 3 wood
[16:52] <Roadcrosser> I was thinking you have to craft books
[16:52] <ZarroTsu> otherwise, another weird offset is clay, sort of. pretty much clay block -> 4 clay -> 4 bricks -> 1 brick block
[16:52] <Sr_creeper> IN a sandwhich style
[16:52] <Roadcrosser> And use an axe on wood

[16:54] <xjiro> one solution to skeletons
[16:54] <xjiro> duelwield a shield that you hold out to null arrows

[16:54] <ouT|Phaze> I haven't found any dungeons or treasure rooms :C

[16:54] <Sr_creeper> Lol, earlier today i saw a slime and a skeleton fighting outside my house.
[16:54] <ouT|Phaze> what do dungeons look like compared to caves?
[16:54] <Roadcrosser> this was before theh update

[16:58] <ouT|Phaze> ZarroTsu: actually, though I understand where you'd get that idea, it's not true, because lowering the accuracy also equally makes them /more/ likely to miss you while you circle strafe them, since they have just as likely a chance of accidentally leading the shot perfectly as they do lagging the shot way too much

[17:00] <Sr_creeper> When SMP comes out, i hope that we can use slime balls as an armor dissolvant
[17:00] <Armonte> atleast aspergers
[17:00] <Miclee> Bomb, have you learned of what torches are?
[17:00] <xjiro> is this over being an autism simulator
[17:00] <C418> well, there is a discussion whether autism actually exists, or if it's another sickness
[17:00] <Bomb_Spammer> The lava tunnel has about 16 fll sized ones all stuck in places they can't jump out of
[17:00] <Rooster> Autism = The new ADHD
[17:00] <Miclee> You can't expect a black cave to be empty.
[17:00] <Bomb_Spammer> They all spawned in broad torchlight
[17:00] <SireTRM> Armonte, go get a job in mental disordrs.
[17:00] <Armonte> Rooster: yeah.
[17:00] <C418> for example
[17:00] <Bomb_Spammer> My mine has been clear for weeks
[17:00] <SireTRM> Disorders*
[17:01] <Rooster> Aspergers = Assholes autism
[17:01] <Armonte> supposably, EVERYBODY ON THE INTERNET has aspergers syndrome
[17:01] <Bomb_Spammer> Not a single zombie or skeleton to be seen
[17:01] <Kitoari> not again.
[17:01] <Miclee> Bomb, pics or it didn't happen
[17:01] <SireTRM> Rooster, I take offense at that.

[17:06] <xjiro> i cannot emphasize this enough
[17:06] <SireTRM> Fiskie, that's just stupid, using that as an insult.
[17:06] <Sr_creeper> Quatroking, Can i ask you one more thing about SMP? Did the mobs spawn when you tested?

[17:12] <Kitoari> today's been a real ban fest
[17:12] <Chezhead> I suggusted that when he makes torches burn out, he changed the item code of torches to lanturns and makes torches something else so our precious saves won't be in the dark after that update
[17:12] <Chezhead> He agreed
[17:12] <Deages> my parents taught me java when I was learning english, from the moment I was born
[17:12] <Visiiri> I hate him

[17:14] <PrincepsRegulus> what
[17:14] <Deages> with the new cactus
[17:14] <Bomb_Spammer> Um
[17:14] <Sr_creeper> Quatroking, how long was it before the network crashed on MP?
[17:14] <BnBns> Can you press Q to drop somehting, and have a mate pick it up
[17:14] <Deages> I put the cactus a block in front of my rear-door
[17:14] <Deages> and now I can enter
[17:14] <Bomb_Spammer> My pictures are slightly too big and don't fit in the post window
[17:14] <Deages> because I keep taking constant damage
[17:14] <Kitoari> 30 minutes according to notch
[17:14] <Bomb_Spammer> How do I fix this
[17:14] <PrincepsRegulus> bnbns, yes
[17:14] <Deages> is this normal?
[17:14] <Quatroking> Sr_creeper, we played for about 45 minutes
[17:14] <Genemos> Sr_creeper: 30 minutes
[17:14] <SireTRM> Kitoari: You open the door and walk in, despite the sign.
[17:14] <Quatroking> Then the server crashed due to a memory leak
[17:14] <BnBns> Thanks :D

[17:16] <Chezhead> WHY ARE THESE COWS IN MY SEWERS
[17:16] <PrincepsRegulus> you fail
[17:16] <melibe> you can still make a cactus trap
[17:16] <ThatCrazyHobo> sup guys
[17:16] <Sr_creeper> SireTRM you cant place cacti next to eachother anymore
[17:16] <Visiiri> not anymore
[17:16] <Antique> Quatro, the one question I have is how resource distribution works
[17:16] <Serow> I made a house over a cactus trap, but you get no loot from it. :[
[17:16] <Quatroking> Dommys, I'll probably remove it within a few days or so
[17:16] <tj505050> what
[17:16] <Deages> question guys, if a creeper steps on/dies on cactus will it treat it as being attacked and explode?
[17:16] <Visiiri> you can't plant a cactus directly next to a cactus
[17:16] <Chezhead> GET OUT OF MY SEWERS SILLY COWS. There isn't even any grass down there!
[17:16] <Chezhead> ASD:LJASDSA
[17:16] <tj505050> what is
[17:16] <Quatroking> Antique, as in?
[17:16] <melibe> you just wont be able to abuse the ecosystem
[17:16] <Deages> I want to use a kind of spiketrap around my base as a moat for mobs
[17:16] <Dommys> Wow, a few days?
[17:16] <Antique> if 1 square of mining = 1 drop, wont that discourage working together? since its hard to find a limitless supply of anything within a reasonable area
[17:16] <tj505050> i just want to email the sorce code to notch after i make it
[17:16] <Quatroking> Antique, well
[17:16] <Snake_> Come on baby, don't fear the Creeper. Baby take my hand, don't fear the Creeper. We'll be able to fly, don't fear the Creeper.

[17:17] <Quatroking> Sr_creeper, we weren't able to make iron due to furnaces not working
[17:17] <tj505050> i would email it to o him
[17:17] <Azu> oh, is it that you can't place cacti next to each other? I noticed that earlier but I thought it was because I was placing them on grass and in the snow
[17:17] <ThatCrazyHobo> antique it droppes 1 fot each player and you can only see and pick up one

[17:17] <Deages> If a creeper steps on a cactus block does it explode then/when it dies?

[17:17] <tj505050> what did i do

[17:18] <SireTRM> Deages, no, creepers only exploded on death in original survival.
[17:18] <Deages> hm
[17:18] <Snake_> They explode when they're close to an enemy.
[17:18] <Quatroking> PrincepsRegulus, and you are saying that that channel has any value
[17:18] <Deages> do they treat the cactus as an enemy?
[17:18] <SireTRM> They explode in proximity.
[17:18] <Deages> and start to explode on first damage?
[17:18] <Genemos> PrincepsRegulus: Ohh noes.... >.<
[17:18] <Deages> cause I want to make a kind of creeper trap
[17:18] <Deages> with cactus
[17:18] <Deages> alll around my base
[17:18] <Deages> as a moat
[17:18] <Quatroking> Roadcrosser, what does damage
[17:18] <Roadcrosser> your wooden tools
[17:18] <PrincepsRegulus> genemos: be quiet :P
[17:18] <ThatCrazyHobo> I thik there should be hidden options/cheats for multiplayer
[17:18] <Quatroking> they take damage, yes
[17:18] * tj505050 want powered minetracks or carts
[17:18] <Roadcrosser> since iron cant be smelted
[17:18] <Deages> I guess no one knows yet :p
[17:18] <Chezhead> Hey Quartoking why aren't you in minecast much?
[17:18] <Quatroking> pvp isn't enabled yet so can't answer that one

[17:19] <tj505050> where
[17:19] <Chezhead> Oh
[17:19] <Quatroking> didn't get a new one
[17:19] <Chezhead> You should
[17:19] <Visiiri> however, until the latency is fixed, I think it's good.
[17:19] <Sr_creeper> Quatroking, Do you know when the next testing is? Will it be when notch fixes furnaces?
[17:19] <Visiiri> You might end up stabbing YOURSELF.
[17:19] <ThatCrazyHobo> not crap ones like infinite blocks or lives but things like all enemies are hostile
[17:19] <Quatroking> Sr_creeper, no idea
[17:19] <Quatroking> hopefully this weekend
[17:19] <Roadcrosser> so quatro how do you chat?
[17:19] <Roadcrosser> I see the chat similar to IRC
[17:20] <Sr_creeper> Prolly same way in creative
[17:20] <SireTRM> Roadcrosser, hit "T"
[17:20] <Visiiri> Yeah, you do.
[17:20] <Roadcrosser> in SMP
[17:20] <Visiiri> It's the same.
[17:20] <Roadcrosser> ...
[17:20] <Quatroking> uh... yeah
[17:20] <SireTRM> Look at your keymap options in the current version, Roadcrosser
[17:20] <Quatroking> you hit T
[17:20] <Roadcrosser> oh
[17:20] <Quatroking> smash your keyboard randomly
[17:20] <Roadcrosser> meh
[17:20] <Visiiri> The effects are pretty cool.
[17:20] <Quatroking> and hit enter

[17:46] <Quatroking> KillingSpree, porn
[17:46] <Plinky> Neon Genesis is my favourite anime, mainly because of the story and how the story was made.
[17:46] <KillingSpree> Ok
[17:46] <KillingSpree> What I thought.
[17:46] <KillingSpree> Lol
[17:46] <Namzo> sometimes its like a bad soap opera
[17:46] <Nahob> I like Death Note
[17:46] <Siiseli> Plinky, I'd have to say neon genesis is one of the worst ones that I've seen
[17:46] <Nahob> Death Note is a good one
[17:46] <Siiseli> death note is fine
[17:46] <Siiseli> it's actually good
[17:46] <Quatroking> Plinky, I liked the first few episodes
[17:46] <Antique> Thats just it. LEVELS of disability. you dissociate severely impairing ones from social ones. but nobody, when they insult 'retards' or so on use it to seriously slight anyone. Its the internet, roll with the punches.
[17:46] <Quatroking> then I was like "what the fuck is this shit"
[17:46] <Antique> Also, typing
[17:46] <Plinky> Siiseli, do you know what is it about? Or not?
[17:46] <Siiseli> Quatroking, yeah the first few were nice
[17:46] <Chezhead> Quartoking should start banning people for off-topic discussion, this is desolving into #anime
[17:46] <Quatroking> the head character is so goddamn annoyin
[17:46] <Siiseli> Plinky, I've watched it
[17:46] <Quatroking> annoying*
[17:46] <Quatroking> "oh god im all emo now I quit"
[17:47] <Quatroking> "oh no lol jk"
[17:47] <Dommys> Antique you're supposed to say "typing" before tldr responses

[17:47] <Plinky> This is true
[17:47] <Dommys> :D
[17:47] <Quatroking> "no seriously i quit now"
[17:47] <Plinky> I liked the basis of it though.
[17:47] <Quatroking> "nah just messin with ya lol!"
[17:47] <Quatroking> this happens about, what, 4 times?
[17:47] <Plinky> Much better than most anime (too many go on forever)
[17:47] <Quatroking> and then the girl shits her brains out and goes emo too
[17:47] <KillingSpree> Hey guiz
[17:47] <Siiseli> Plinky, well depends on what anime you watch
[17:47] <KillingSpree> Ima go play second life

[17:47] <Siiseli> pick anything from my list and it's almost sure to be better
[17:47] <Plinky> By most, I mean episode wise.
[17:48] <Quatroking> Plinky, does neon genesis even have an end
[17:48] <Siiseli> Kitoari, accurate indeewd
[17:48] <Siiseli> Quatroking, why even better, IT HAS SEVERAL
[17:48] <Quatroking> also I don't watch animes that are longer than, what, 30 episodes or so
[17:48] <Deepa> Quatroking: Yes, it's called End of Evangelion
[17:48] <KillingSpree> Wow
[17:48] <KillingSpree> go watch dbz

[17:48] <Quatroking> deepa: he wins the battle and he chokes a girl
[17:48] <Quatroking> ...for no reason

[17:51] <Link2006> DO it

[19:45] <Scrippy> Like 10 servers linked together
[19:45] <Nahob> Minecraft should be like it is now. A bunch of different servers with each server bein its own new game so no cross server inv items or saves or BULLCARP like that.

[20:32] <DrakeHiggins|Art> It's very short and temporary.
[20:32] <TehButter> Dim: its in the rules, like he said
[20:32] <Viral> 6 hours isn't exactly super short
[20:32] <DoG|Away> Banned for autorejoin?
[20:32] <Shapeshiftr> Damn.
[20:32] <TheMilkMan> Cool I just found a huge tree lol

[20:33] <So_Useless> I don't.
[20:33] <DrakeHiggins|Art> I'm just enforcing them. -.-

[20:36] <Shapeshiftr> and then my screen started to shake violently back and forth.

[20:36] <TehButter> Cant argue with that.

[20:37] <funnyguy3D> dimjim who was that?
[20:37] <DimJim> yeah, but he's useless for beta testing
[20:37] <Shapeshiftr> So?
[20:37] <TehButter> Not really.
[20:37] <Shapeshiftr> Notch trusts him.
[20:37] <So_Useless> DimJim, not really.
[20:37] <Shapeshiftr> And, why not?
[20:37] <funnyguy3D> ya and the founder of the forums should at least play
[20:37] <DimJim> well, he says "ez invited him" so i don't know
[20:37] <TehButter> People who dont know how to play are usually very good at finding bugs.
[20:37] <DimJim> it sounds like bull
[20:37] <funnyguy3D> otherwise why
[20:37] <So_Useless> He is another body in the game. So, there's that.

[20:38] <TheMilkMan> Damn notch soulda made them more grow, the reeds I had to walk for 4.64 mbs before I found any :/
[20:38] <So_Useless> I am considering quitting my shitty job. I need the money, but I hate it so much.
[20:38] <Kitoari> it's my primary source of income
[20:38] <funnyguy3D> and i dont know much on how to play
[20:38] <So_Useless> I know better than to let IRC dictate such decisions, though.
[20:38] <Shrub> I haven't found any clay or papyrus :(
[20:38] <tj505050> the slime dosent even eat apples

[20:38] <Eagle> that would take up some time

[20:39] <tj505050> doy
[20:39] <EmpiresBane> does lava lag anyone else?
[20:39] <Zenthos> So does feeding the slime slime balls really make them grow?
[20:39] <Shapeshiftr> And some bricks, too.
[20:39] <Kitoari> you could play disgaea 3
[20:39] <tj505050> nope
[20:39] <Kitoari> that's a big time sink
[20:39] <So_Useless> Can you make slime blocks?
[20:39] <So_Useless> I assume not.
[20:39] <Kitoari> by big I mean
[20:39] <tj505050> they dont even eat apples
[20:39] <TehButter> You could play hero core :B

[20:39] <So_Useless> It's like six hours long.
[20:39] <TehButter> Useless: Oh god.
[20:40] <tj505050> they should eat slime balls
[20:40] <Shapeshiftr> I'm playing through Baten Kaitos right now.
[20:40] <TehButter> tj: they should eat NOTHING
[20:40] <Cheeseyx> No, I watched the three hour long version
[20:40] <DimJim> disgaea reminds me too much of life
[20:40] <TehButter> now stop talking about that
[20:40] <So_Useless> I've seen the uncut version once. I haven't been able to sit through the whole thing since.
[20:40] <TehButter> D:
[20:40] <Shapeshiftr> Great RPG, horrible voice acting.
[20:40] <Cheeseyx> Wow
[20:40] <Cheeseyx> How was the uncut version?

[20:41] <TehButter> Now i have a wasted bucket.
[20:41] <Cheeseyx> Paper is for books
[20:41] <So_Useless> Yeah. You probably got a better experience with the normal version.
[20:41] <TehButter> Books are for bookshelves
[20:42] <TehButter> Derp!

[20:44] <DimJim> i decided to stream slimecraft for my friends because they told me to

[20:44] <DimJim> when i opened it up the yellowtext was "Livestreamed!"

[20:45] <DatOneGuy> oh u

[20:45] <Shapeshiftr> Lol.
[20:45] <tj505050> :(
[20:45] <Eagle> Important life lesson everybody :O
[20:45] <Kitoari> making books writeable wouldn't be hard
[20:45] <DatOneGuy> The map is actually bigger than the visualizer shows?
[20:45] <Shapeshiftr> It would be a lot like signs.
[20:45] <Kitoari> when a book is created, give it an id and create an array
[20:46] <Kitoari> that array contains the text of every page in the book
[20:46] <DatOneGuy> Yes it'd be extremely simple, it always is
[20:46] <Kitoari> for reading it you could do something similar to how writing on the sign is displayed

[20:48] <Kitoari> I would be useless for finding bugs
[20:48] <So_Useless> "DEBIT CARD!"
[20:48] <Eagle> It's testing without you
[20:48] <Eagle> right now
[20:48] <Kitoari> meaning that I have no use as a tester
[20:48] <So_Useless> Indeed.
[20:48] <Pelum> i thought a decent idea for the testing would be to get people from all around the world see what its like having people play from a different country
[20:48] <DimJim> all i'd do in smp beta is stare at notch
[20:48] <Eagle> Your wallet is Notch.
[20:48] <Azure> Notch is in my wallet
[20:49] <DimJim> or act like it's a normal game of smp and think the other players were mobs

[21:16] <Kitoari> 2) It's a preorder.
[21:16] <vurtual> Preorders shouldn't charge more.
[21:16] <vurtual> Look at steam.
[21:16] <vurtual> Preorder=save money
[21:16] <Kitoari> no
[21:16] <Kitoari> I meant this:
[21:16] <TehButter> Actually
[21:16] <tj505050> um when is smp being realesed full
[21:16] <tj505050> y
[21:16] <Kitoari> If you wait until after a game is released

[21:17] <TehButter> which is why
[21:17] <TehButter> i dont do preorders
[21:17] <TehButter> :D
[21:17] <DatOneGuy> Games should cost 50 at max man
[21:17] <tj505050> lol
[21:17] <tj505050> lol true
[21:17] <vurtual> 30 is plenty if you're not so stupid as to use discs
[21:17] <DatOneGuy> And they should actually get cheaper after a year they've been out

[21:26] <Kitoari> for reference, FF13 was $60 when it first came out, and I'm far more partial to LBP2 than I am FF13.
[21:26] <vurtual> also, MW2!
[21:26] <vede> Hm. I guess if I really wanted to stream something, I could stream from VLC and have anyone who really wants to watch connect manually with their video player of choice that supports streaming video.
[21:26] <vurtual> Which was clearly such a big deal
[21:26] <TehButter> Oh jeez.
[21:26] <vurtual> with that wonderful and fun "pay for maps on disc" function
[21:27] <Zenthos> I want LBP2... too bad I cant afford a ps3
[21:27] <Kitoari> vurtual: so it wasn't $60
[21:27] <Kitoari> amirite
[21:27] <Shapeshiftr> I want to make hot love to Cartograph right now.
[21:27] <vurtual> Shapeshiftr
[21:27] <Shapeshiftr> Metaphorically, of course.
[21:27] <Kitoari> sadly, LBP will have DLC too
[21:27] <Kitoari> oh well
[21:27] <vurtual> WHERE IS THE IMAGE EXPORTED TO
[21:27] <Scrippy> FF13 looks dumb.
[21:27] <Shapeshiftr> The Cartograph folder...
[21:27] <TehButter> FF10>FF13
[21:27] <TehButter> Trust me
[21:27] <vurtual> in the java one
[21:27] <TehButter> :B
[21:27] <vurtual> where there is no folder
[21:27] <Scrippy> So far it is the only final fantasy game other than 4 that I don't own.
[21:27] <Scrippy> I am a goddamn fanatic.
[21:27] <Kitoari> I hate FF10 and I still agree with tehbutter
[21:27] <Shapeshiftr> Don't use that.
[21:27] <vurtual> The other one doesn't run on linux.
[21:27] <Shapeshiftr> Use the other one that has a folder.
[21:27] <Shapeshiftr> Oh.
[21:27] <vurtual> Which is a miiinor problem.
[21:27] <TehButter> Kit: thats the point
[21:27] <Scrippy> Anybody played Final Fantasy tactics?

[21:32] <DatOneGuy> What, gg?
[21:32] <Scrippy> Jaja.
[21:32] <DatOneGuy> Most disable it, which is good
[21:32] <sorre> me and some friends trololo'd a RO server a couple years back
[21:33] <DatOneGuy> Gameguard is absolute shit on all accounts
[21:33] <Scrippy> I'm tired of my server's shitty WoE.
[21:33] <Scrippy> >.>
[21:33] <sorre> there was one guild that owned ALL the guild castles
[21:33] <DatOneGuy> WoE is fun
[21:33] <DatOneGuy> Or was fun
[21:33] <Scrippy> Well
[21:33] <DatOneGuy> Not sure how that's changed with 3-1, and I guess 3-2 is about by now
[21:33] <sorre> and three of us showed up and broke their shit
[21:33] <Scrippy> Right as the server started up
[21:33] <vurtual> I'm not sure if this is an attempt to write "SOS", or a summoning circle
[21:33] <vurtual> ...for a helicopter maybe?
[21:33] <Scrippy> One guild of super have-their-shit togehter people left and joined the server together
[21:34] <DatOneGuy> I will say that while RO has been the best MMO longstanding, it's the slowest with updates
[21:34] <vurtual> Hahaha I can just imagine it now
[21:34] <sorre> our tactics were massively troll, too
[21:34] <DatOneGuy> 2-2 took HOW fucking long to come out...
[21:34] <sorre> we were using dancers with Please Don't Forget Me
[21:34] <vurtual> some primitive people drawing a helipad indicator, thinking it's some kind of summoning circle
[21:34] <sorre> priests with attack element change spells
[21:34] <DatOneGuy> At least they're still working on it though, I mean it's been out for practically forgeever and they're stilll making classes, crazy.
[21:34] <Scrippy> And it's one guild against two bigger ones
[21:34] <vurtual> then a helicopter comes and oh hey
[21:34] <Scrippy> Mine and our ally's
[21:34] <Scrippy> And they are dominating.
[21:34] <Scrippy> Hargaghagh
[21:34] <Scrippy> Makes me foam at the mouth.
[21:34] <sorre> and my friend made this hilarious rogue that was assassin-proof
[21:34] <sorre> JUST to troll the huge number of nub assassins
[21:35] <Scrippy> Assassins aren't great anyway.
[21:35] <Scrippy> There used to be so many
[21:35] <Scrippy> Everywhere
[21:35] <Scrippy> And then people realized they were meh.
[21:35] <DatOneGuy> Bleh, learn to play right and you can be OP with any class
[21:35] <sorre> did people finally realize that?
[21:35] <Scrippy> And started making Profs.
[21:35] <Scrippy> Yup.
[21:35] <sorre> but yeah, at this point there were a lot of assassins
[21:35] <Scrippy> Crusader is the new noob class of choice now.
[21:35] <vurtual> this adventure is worthy of lord of the rings adventuring music

[21:38] <TehButter> One of my favorite MMO's, till it died...
[21:38] <Kokopure> Scrippy, what are soil farms?
[21:38] <Scrippy> it's when you force increase soils to multiply by getting an assassin with 100 Pdodge.
[21:38] <Kokopure> ...
[21:38] <Scrippy> You get like 3,000 on the same map in a small area.
[21:38] <Kokopure> ... oh, I thought you were talking about Minecraft.
[21:38] <Scrippy> Nope.
[21:38] <DatOneGuy> Lol

[21:40] <Kokopure> agreed, mnjiman
[21:40] <Kokopure> oh hey
[21:40] <TehButter> Koko:
[21:40] <Scrippy> And it takes like 5 minutes to get that many soils.
[21:40] <vurtual> what's this strange gray goopy block?
[21:40] <Kokopure> mnjiman, your name sounds familiar
[21:40] <TehButter> Papyrus obsession
[21:40] <TehButter> <3
[21:40] <DatOneGuy> I rememeber (hopefuly there are still some) when they made the super hardcore areas
[21:40] <TehButter> Vurtual:
[21:40] <TehButter> Its clay
[21:40] <DatOneGuy> You'd pretty much HAVE to party
[21:40] <Kokopure> I think I bitched you out on the forum once
[21:40] <TehButter> Put it in a smelter
[21:40] <vurtual> k
[21:40] <DatOneGuy> And even thenget lucky and live
[21:40] <TehButter> it makes brick
[21:40] <Scrippy> They still do
[21:40] <mnjiman> Jiman is my true name, mnjiman is a variation of it :)
[21:40] <Kokopure> ahh
[21:40] <DatOneGuy> We'd get half the people on the server ( like 30) and roll deep in those fuckers
[21:40] <mnjiman> ive been around ^_^
[21:40] <Kokopure> heh :3
[21:40] <Scrippy> The areas are hardcoreer and party-wipeyer now.
[21:40] <mnjiman> not in the slutty kind of way though
[21:41] <TehButter> I think ill be off for the night...
[21:41] <Kokopure> I won't judge~
[21:41] <LordAidan> Argh, annoying bug.
[21:41] <palamedes> Kokopure, you can make bamboo paper and that looks nothing like papyrus
[21:41] <DatOneGuy> It was awesome when we were 75~ish pre-trans
[21:41] <vurtual> hehehe
[21:41] <LordAidan> Sometimes, when you click on a block
[21:41] <TehButter> Night all

[21:41] <TehButter> =D
[21:41] <vurtual> my "dive for my crafting table Id rpoped in water" incident
[21:41] <LordAidan> it wont friggin pick it up
[21:41] <DatOneGuy> I guess that's what really made RO fun for me though

[21:41] <Kokopure> well
[21:41] <DatOneGuy> Lol xD
[21:41] <palamedes> pretty sure it's bamboo or some kind of woody reed
[21:41] <Kokopure> it looks like bamboo
[21:41] <DatOneGuy> I liked Thanatos too, was cool
[21:41] <Kokopure> but D:
[21:41] <DatOneGuy> Last I played I know they made some sort of magma dungeon or something
[21:41] <Kokopure> http://www.jadu.de/pm/pics/papyrus4.jpg <--- this is Papyrus
[21:41] <DatOneGuy> Barely played it, wasn't that fun :\
[21:41] <Scrippy> I'm probably just gonna abdicate as guild leader after MPS comes out.
[21:42] <Scrippy> God.
[21:42] <Scrippy> Things are so much worse than that now.
[21:42] <Kokopure> yeah, Notch probably made it look like Bamboo on purpose
[21:42] <DatOneGuy> Although I'm sure it wasn't fun to me because I was playing HR at that point, since my LR server died

[21:43] <Scrippy> And the chance to one-shot you.
[21:43] <palamedes> that doesn't mean anything Kokopure
[21:43] <DatOneGuy> Jesus, that's my favorite HR server game
[21:43] <DatOneGuy> Oh I remember Randgris
[21:43] <Scrippy> Don't even get me started on Satan Morocc.
[21:43] <DatOneGuy> Don't think we ever killed her lol..
[21:43] <Deages> bit rusty on IRC OP end, what was the channel owner command to revertr the settings from @/+ only to include the other access levels such as SOP (&), owner (~) and so on?
[21:43] <DatOneGuy> That's the 100 level dungeon?
[21:43] <palamedes> it just means that one or two guys think it's papyrus
[21:43] <Scrippy> Naw.
[21:43] <Deages> or is that restricted to certain IRC daemons/ircop config?
[21:43] <Scrippy> There is no level 100 dungeon
[21:43] <Kokopure> oh dear.
[21:43] <Kokopure> you know

[22:35] <Scrippy> Nobody has any military skills.
[22:35] <vurtual> while bigger boats have seperate sections for each part of the boat you craft.
[22:35] <vurtual> and they would accordingly impede you
[22:36] <KillingSpree> Vurtual
[22:36] <Shapeshiftr> Yeah, that would be awesome, vurtual
[22:36] <vurtual> breaking the back would drag down the boat, or the front could leak and that'd make you sink down when you go forward
[22:36] <Antique> Option B) boats have 300mph thrust but shatter in a slight breeze

[23:05] <TrueWolves> Every pokemon can take any of the 5 main status ailements except fire pokemon can't be burned, and poison and steel pokemon can't be poisoned.
[23:05] <TrueWolves> There are a few exceptions
[23:06] <Sturmeh> they can't?
[23:06] <Sturmeh> D:
[23:06] <TrueWolves> and none of those exceptions are even powerful pokemon.
[23:06] <Pelum> i dunno

[23:07] <Reverissa> evolve or not D:
[23:07] <Sturmeh> B
[23:07] <TrueWolves> Hmm?
[23:07] <TrueWolves> A good idea is to not evolve a pokemon until it learns all of it's moves
[23:07] <TrueWolves> then you get the best moves earily, and the pokemon once evolved losses no power.
[23:07] <Reverissa> Know what level charmander learns flamethrower?
[23:07] <Sturmeh> u can delay it indefinately
[23:08] <TrueWolves> ... eeh...
[23:08] <Sturmeh> and evolve it in 3 levels
[23:08] <TrueWolves> Charmander is a special case.
[23:08] <Reverissa> I know that
[23:08] <Reverissa> but,
[23:08] <Reverissa> Shoot.
[23:08] * Reverissa looks at her level 26 Charmander.
[23:08] <Reverissa> Oh dear.
[23:08] <Sturmeh> just go to the mall and buy it
[23:08] <TrueWolves> You /want/ to evolve charmander in to a charizard at level 36 so it can learn wing attack.
[23:08] <Sturmeh> :\
[23:08] <Reverissa> k.
[23:08] <Sturmeh> u can learn it at lvl 5
[23:08] <Sturmeh> D:
[23:08] <Sturmeh> i like those op tm's
[23:08] <Reverissa> So dont evolve to charmeleon till level 35?
[23:08] <Sturmeh> or was it fireblast
[23:08] <Sturmeh> i forget
[23:08] <TrueWolves> So just make charmander a charmillion before level 35, and make sure it evolves in to a charizard when it can at 36.

[23:28] <Farn> run fast on the land!

[23:28] <CyborgDragon> 1. cannons, 2. horses, 3. goblin towns, 4. biomes, 5. subbiomes(dragon caves)
[23:28] <Farn> tit will be useful with saddle

[23:28] <CyborgDragon> you cant teach a wild horse without reins, can you?
[23:28] <Rooster> I was think you would need a hitching spot to stop it from dispawning, and it would be attacked by mobs.
[23:29] <vurtual> If you don't want people to start in a tavern, then herd every player into a seperate IRC channel.
[23:29] <Rooster> So you would have to build a stable.
[23:29] * CyborgDragon thinks the saddle should be turned into saddle and reins
[23:29] <Einherjar> or just reins, even
[23:29] <vurtual> Their entire intro and origin starts in that channel, alone, and they have to FIND eachother, eventually reaching some pivotal location(hurr tavern), and bam, you all put them in one channel.
[23:29] <CyborgDragon> reins, bareback riding yeah!
[23:29] <Einherjar> It's hard to ride a horse with no reins
[23:29] <Einherjar> But it can be done
[23:29] <Einherjar> I think

[23:58] <Farn> woah,3x3x3 so large

[23:58] <Farn> teven with armor
[23:58] <vurtual> and my gaming computer cannot be turned on
[23:58] <vurtual> as the generator cannot handle it
[23:58] <CyborgDragon> i thought the largest a slime could get without hax was 2x2
[23:58] <TrueWolves> so you could make a pit with a slime or two or three and trick mobs in to it.
[23:58] <vurtual> simply, no generator can supply that room.
[23:58] <CyborgDragon> also, vurt, gta: dying west isnt for the pc
