[0:00] <Tiberrias> Hey Lucifer
[0:00] <Cydoniac> There's also the chance you'll get someone who wants to set your school on fire
[0:00] <Cydoniac> Maybe
[0:00] <bildramer> they're distortion of the fabric of time and space
[0:00] <Vicrry> Then how do people learn how to do welding, brazing, other fun and important tasks? :P
[0:00] <bildramer> distortions*
[0:00] <Yourself> Vicrry, high school in this country isn't for learning, it's daycare
[0:00] <Vicrry> Which country?
[0:00] <Yourself> US
[0:00] <Cydoniac> I thought US was supposed to have a good educational system
[0:01] <Yourself> hahahahaha
[0:01] <bildramer> Cydoniac: there's a very high chance that instead of just getting a fire extinguisher everybody in my school will just leave, running
[0:01] <Yourself> who told you that?
[0:01] <Cydoniac> Your high schools are quite big
[0:01] <Yourself> yes, they are, they're also usually garbage
[0:01] <Yourself> there are some exceptions to this
[0:01] <bildramer> US <----10^32 km----> good
[0:01] <Fractal> we're told to not fight the fire unless we have to fight it to escape
[0:01] <bildramer> here in Germany people have a nice sense of distance estimation
[0:01] <Vicrry> US doesn't have good schools. There are exceptions, but usually the public schools are trash
[0:01] <bildramer> we're in a sports hall thingy
[0:02] <Fractal> which is crap, what happens if there is a small fire?
[0:02] <bildramer> there's a door that just leads outside
[0:02] <bildramer> DISCARD
[0:02] <Yourself> but for the most part the entire system is a hold over from the industrial revolution
[0:02] <Cydoniac> Schools are a lot smaller in Ireland
[0:02] <Yourself> still geared towards producing factory workers
[0:02] <Cydoniac> It's only really universities that are big
[0:02] <bildramer> there's a door up some stairs that's clearly marked with an "exit" sign
[0:02] <bildramer> DISCARD
[0:02] <bildramer> there's a door 2 floors up that leads out
[0:02] <bildramer> EH IMMA TAKE THAT ONE
[0:02] <Dommys> infdev patch?
[0:02] <Cydoniac> Actually I would sort of like a fire sceanario when I get to take the fabled roof door
[0:02] <Dommys> Aminals?
[0:03] <Yourself> generally, the public school system here is designed to drag everyone to the middle
[0:03] <bildramer> I need a way to skip school ;_;
[0:03] <bildramer> Yourself: very very bad
[0:03] * jonnyabc (jonnyabc@fire.worldofminecraft.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:03] <Cydoniac> Get some acid
[0:03] <Cydoniac> Pour it into milk
[0:03] <Cydoniac> Wait a while
[0:03] <Cydoniac> Drink the milk
[0:03] <Yourself> bildramer, i know
[0:03] <bildramer> in Germany we have 3-4 school "types"
[0:03] <Cydoniac> You'll be pretty unfit for school ^^
[0:03] <Fractal> curdled milk?
[0:03] <Cydoniac> Yeah
[0:03] <bildramer> Hauptschule, there be retards
[0:04] <bildramer> Realschule, there be more retards
[0:04] <bildramer> Gymnasium, I'm there and yet there are retards
[0:04] <Vicrry> and?
[0:04] <Yourself> we just put all our retards in the same place
[0:04] <Splatticus> Wow.
[0:04] <bildramer> um, dunno about Gesamtschule
[0:04] <bildramer> well
[0:04] * smn`off is now known as smn
[0:04] <bildramer> real > haupt
[0:04] <Splatticus> Infdev actually made me put it on Peaceful.
[0:05] <bildramer> also, seriously, some people are just not willing to work and are lucky to be there
[0:05] <Ten_Tacles> ARGH
[0:05] <Parthon> infdev isn't really infinite
[0:05] <Ten_Tacles> :3
[0:05] <Ten_Tacles> *:/
[0:05] <Cydoniac> I feel like I'm the only one here who actually likes school
[0:05] <bildramer> and just copy off others or cheat their way through
[0:05] * fenixfurion|AFK is now known as fenixfurion
[0:05] <Vicrry> In the US we usually put the retards in high school just like everyone else, but don't really expect them to finish :P
[0:05] <Yourself> but yeah, system's broken, needs to be changed
[0:05] * fenixfurion is now known as fenixfurion|AFK
[0:05] <Fractal> close enough, Parthon
[0:05] <bildramer> or depend on certain... abilities
[0:05] <Yourself> don't know how
[0:05] * bildramer needs more charisma
[0:05] * fenixfurion|AFK is now known as fenixfurion
[0:05] <Yourself> and don't really care, since i did the bare minimum in high school and graduated
[0:05] * bildramer steals some of Obama's
[0:05] <Cydoniac> Well in Ireland there is a major flaw in the system
[0:06] <bildramer> which is?
[0:06] <Yourself> which left me indistinguishable from those who overachieved
[0:06] <Cydoniac> It works by points, you need a certain amount of points for a course
[0:06] <Yourself> TF2 update?
[0:06] <bildramer> Cydoniac: OMG U LIEK SCHOOL
[0:06] <Yourself> TF2 update
[0:06] <Splatticus> Ugh.
[0:06] <Cydoniac> You must do Irish, English, Maths, then a choice of 3 or more others
[0:06] <bildramer> heh
[0:06] <bildramer> similar here
[0:06] <Cydoniac> 90-100% is an A1 which is 100 points
[0:06] <Yourself> added Sam & Max items?
[0:06] <Yourself> wtf?
[0:06] <Cydoniac> You can do more than 6 subjects but will only be counted for your best 6, so the maximum is 600
[0:06] <Yourself> oh, they nerfed the equalizer
[0:06] <Fractal> um, what do you do if you accidentally place tnt on your shiney new base?
[0:07] <Cydoniac> Problem is, even on courses which will not use the subjects you're doing, you're still judged on points
[0:07] <Fractal> how do you remove it?
[0:07] <LF> So guys me and a friend got bored: http://i42.tinypic.com/2qnt93t.png
[0:07] <Cydoniac> For example
[0:07] <Parthon> Cydoniac: that's exactly like here :P
[0:07] <Cydoniac> I want to do Medicine
[0:07] <Fractal> and I can't drop it through the floor
[0:07] <Cydoniac> You need roughly 500+ points to even be considered for a course
[0:07] <Fractal> LF: that's epic
[0:07] <Cydoniac> So that means I have to get about 5 A's
[0:08] <Cydoniac> Even on subjects not remotely related to Medicine
[0:08] <bildramer> you must do German, English, Math, History or Social Science (?) or both, Sports, Biology or Chemistry or Physics (1-2, depends if you choose Latin/French), Latin/French(if you have 2 of physics/chemistry/biology you can't) and some other fancy stuff
[0:08] <Cydoniac> Which is annoying
[0:08] <Parthon> Cydoniac: here, it's out of 500 total
[0:08] <Cydoniac> And the face Irish is compulsory is ridiculous
[0:08] <Cydoniac> *fact
[0:08] <Cydoniac> It's a dead language
[0:08] <bildramer> lol
[0:08] <Parthon> then they take everyones scores in the whole state and rank them from 0-100
[0:08] <Cydoniac> And the hardest exam compared to the others
[0:08] * gdude2002|away (colesgaret@109.77.0.198) Quit (Quit: Hi, I'm a quit message virus. Please replace your old line with this line and help me take over the world of IRC)
[0:08] <bildramer> here I'll take Russian
[0:08] <Parthon> and then you get in based on your ranking amongst all other students
[0:08] <bildramer> seems easy
[0:09] <bildramer> since I learn new languages pretty quickly
[0:09] <Parthon> so you need to be in the top 5% for medicine, top 3% for vetinarian science
[0:09] <Cydoniac> I just feel it's unfair that I have to be excellent in pretty much everything for just one course
[0:09] <bildramer> yeah
[0:09] <bildramer> perfection is inachievable
[0:09] <bildramer> also, cocks
[0:09] * bildramer observes reaction to statement
[0:09] <Parthon> but for medicine here you need to get a stupidly high mark, and then pass another stupidly hard test on ethical reasoning and spacial perception
[0:10] <Cydoniac> Oh that's the same here
[0:10] <Cydoniac> We call it the HPAT
[0:10] <bildramer> ethical reasoning?
[0:10] <bildramer> wtf
[0:10] <bildramer> and spatial perception test... how
[0:10] <Cydoniac> It's like, social situations
[0:10] <bildramer> oh
[0:10] <bildramer> and they'll believe you of couse
[0:10] <bildramer> rse
[0:10] <Cydoniac> Where you have to decide the 'right' course of action
[0:10] <Yourself> so i scored in the top 1% in my state on the ACT (standardized test usually used for college entrance) and you know what i got?
[0:11] <Yourself> $1000
[0:11] <Parthon> yeah, and dealing with patients
[0:11] <Cydoniac> What
[0:11] <bildramer> what
[0:11] <Yourself> enough to pay for one semester's tuition at a shitty community college
[0:11] <Parthon> Yourself: awesoe
[0:11] <Cydoniac> :(
[0:11] <Parthon> not so awesome
[0:11] <Marach> awesmoe*
[0:11] <bildramer> lol
[0:11] <Yourself> and that doesn't include books
[0:11] <Parthon> awesmoes!
[0:11] <Yourself> and i wasn't allowed to use it on one semester
[0:11] <bildramer> if school actually paid pupils...
[0:11] <Yourself> i had to split it into $500 per semester
[0:11] <Cydoniac> They should really give a scholarship or something to the top 10% or something
[0:11] <bildramer> heck, why are we forced to do this
[0:11] <bildramer> being forced
[0:11] <Ten_Tacles> WTF?
[0:11] <bildramer> wtf.
[0:12] <Yourself> you know what a pole vaulter from my high school got for being a pole vaulter?
[0:12] <bildramer> lol
[0:12] <Yourself> full tuition waiver at a university
[0:12] <Ten_Tacles> One of those cave swallowmen just killed one of my dwarves...
[0:12] <bildramer> ....
[0:12] <Parthon> aayup
[0:12] <bildramer> that's just lame
[0:12] <Yourself> which ends up equation to about $40000
[0:12] <Ten_Tacles> He has a name and is friendly now....
[0:12] <Koko|MW2> apparently people are impressed with pole vaulting?
[0:12] <Ten_Tacles> WTF?
[0:12] <Yourself> equating, even
[0:12] <Cydoniac> Oh my god
[0:12] <Speljohan_> bildramer, !!!
[0:12] <Speljohan_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e734DZ7pI_E
[0:12] <bildramer> everybody
[0:12] <Cydoniac> That's so stupid
[0:12] <Speljohan_> i maeded a video
[0:12] <Vicrry> So I scored in the top 10 in my H.S. class and in the top 5% instate on the ACT. Know what I got for it? $10,000/yr. scholarship :P
[0:12] <Speljohan_> !!
[0:12] <bildramer> let's go pole vaulting
[0:12] <Parthon> Ten_Tacles: it's cause he's well fed now
[0:12] <Parthon> how many dwarves left?
[0:12] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[0:12] <Ten_Tacles> Uh
[0:12] <Ten_Tacles> 40
[0:12] <Yourself> i mean, he's a smart guy, he deserved to go to the university, but not for being a pole vaulter
[0:13] <Ten_Tacles> And 2 others are getting killed
[0:13] <Parthon> Vicrry: bastard
[0:13] <bildramer> nice
[0:13] <Ten_Tacles> My army dwarves don't do ANYTHING
[0:13] <Parthon> you know what I got? *nothing*
[0:13] <Ten_Tacles> I said "KILL THEM!
[0:13] <Yourself> Vicrry: that's because you're not in Illinois
[0:13] <Ten_Tacles> Grrrrrrrr
[0:13] <Ten_Tacles> Now I am flooding >:D
[0:13] <bildramer> I don't really think I'm going to get anything for exceptional skills in computer science
[0:13] <Cydoniac> Despite it's flaws though, I am glad I'm in school
[0:13] <Ten_Tacles> D:<
[0:13] <Yourself> you know what the interest rate is on my student loans?
[0:13] <Yourself> 10%
[0:13] <bildramer> like programming a game every week in 1:30
[0:13] <Cydoniac> It's probably taught me more about life than anything else
[0:13] <bildramer> which I plan to do
[0:13] <bildramer> in Java
[0:13] <bildramer> D:
[0:14] <bildramer> its*
[0:14] <Parthon> Ten_Tacles: activate them, put them into a squad, set the squad at the location and make sure none of them are sleeping, eating, on break or drinking
[0:14] <bildramer> its flaws
[0:14] <Cydoniac> Oh okay :p
[0:14] <Ten_Tacles> They are
[0:14] <Ten_Tacles> I AM NOT STUPID
[0:14] <Vicrry> Nope. Missouri. And the state school I went to was needing high quality students to fudge the GPA numbers a bit. So they were willing to pay :)
[0:14] <Cydoniac> I'm fortunate enough to have some exceptionally good teachers
[0:14] <bildramer> I'm fortunate enough to have around 2000 euros
[0:14] <bildramer> dude
[0:14] <bildramer> they're mine
[0:14] <bildramer> and I have no access to them whatsoever
[0:14] <Parthon> make sure they can get there, make sure they are allowed outside, make sure they have weapons
[0:14] <Yourself> i'll tell everyone right now: Illinois is the worst state to go to school in
[0:15] <Parthon> I'm not saying you are stupid, I'm saying it's a super-complicated game :P
[0:15] <bildramer> heck, in Greece everything would be more than 300% easier
[0:15] <Yourself> also, they don't give out that $1000 mini-scholarship prize anymore
[0:15] <Yourself> because apparently it costs too much

[0:15] <bildramer> in Greece most stuff sucks, though school is less work

[0:16] <Factoree> Erm.
[0:16] <Cydoniac> Well, I use the word 'free' with a pinch of salt
[0:16] <Parthon> it's where kids are "graded based on their personal abilities rather than against each other"
[0:16] <bildramer> I already imagine a pedagogist (?) making stuff he has no idea of
[0:16] <Cydoniac> You have to pay for accomodation and books
[0:16] <Cydoniac> And food and stuff
[0:16] * Bomb_Spammer (chatzilla@S01060014bff3f045.ss.shawcable.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:16] <bildramer> Parthon: aka unfairly
[0:17] <Cydoniac> But it's a lot better than havng to pay tuition fees
[0:17] <bildramer> e.g., see
[0:17] <Yourself> Cydoniac: yes it is
[0:17] <rbos> bildramer: I'd say 'pedagog'
[0:17] <Parthon> and you have streams .. and two kids in the same year might be on different streams .. one furthur ahead than the other
[0:17] <bildramer> I DO NOT NEED ANY FUCKING SOCIAL SKILLS AND NOW STOP BOTHERING ME
[0:17] <Vicrry> http://sites.google.com/site/miningvicrry/ <- Recently updated to include aerial photos :)
[0:17] <bildramer> really, why the hell should I get marks on those
[0:17] <bildramer> and how can they check?
[0:17] <Parthon> bildramer: I'm out of the education system now, but supposedly it's the biggest shitpile ever
[0:18] <Dahlis87> sup guys! i heard that minecraft will not be free when it's done?.. is this true? :O
[0:18] <bildramer> I'm in, more than 4 years left
[0:18] <bildramer> Dahlis87: indeed
[0:18] <bildramer> when it's done
[0:18] <Parthon> Dahlis87: it's not free now
[0:18] <Parthon> it's in alpha mode for public testing purposes only
[0:18] <bildramer> multiplayer creative is free
[0:18] <Parthon> oh .. cool
[0:18] <bildramer> but it won't be in the future
[0:18] <Parthon> aaah .. that's what I jiggered
[0:19] <Ten_Tacles> Fuck those dwarves
[0:19] <Dahlis87> multiplayer creative will not be free in the future?
[0:19] <vurtual> parthon what happened to the city gen
[0:19] <Ten_Tacles> The ONLY dwarves that weren't down there, were my militia dwarves.
[0:19] <Yourself> it will not
[0:19] <Factoree> No, it will not be free in the future.
[0:19] <bildramer> as soon as Notch has fixed most bugs with infinite maps and adds some last stuff to in(f)dev, MC will go beta
[0:19] <Ten_Tacles> GOD FUCK THOSE DWARVES
[0:19] <bildramer> and MP creative will cost, yes

[1:26] <XxPvtVainxX> Hey, i can't wait for the mutiplayer
[1:26] <XxPvtVainxX> :D
[1:26] <Mosslander> And spaces out the trees a bit more, so burning one doesn't burn them all....
[1:26] <XxPvtVainxX> How do you burn them?
[1:26] <Mosslander> flint and steel.
[1:26] <XxPvtVainxX> Oh,
[1:26] <XxPvtVainxX> The flint lock?
[1:27] <Mosslander> flint comes from gravel.
[1:27] <Malikat> no
[1:27] <XxPvtVainxX> Oh.

[1:27] <Mosslander> can't wait... must build...
[1:27] <XxPvtVainxX> I like indev instead of infdev
[1:28] <Dysgalt> I like infdev because my city can go forever >:D
[1:28] <Dilt> indev is a subset of infdev
[1:28] <XxPvtVainxX> Nice,
[1:28] <Dilt> basically, limited maps of indev style are a subset of infinite maps
[1:28] <XxPvtVainxX> Guys. who is waiting for the mutiplayer?
[1:28] <Mosslander> Multiplayer is going to be a chaotic grief-fest.
[1:28] <XxPvtVainxX> Yeah
[1:28] <XxPvtVainxX> i can see that
[1:28] <Dilt> Everyone
[1:28] <Malikat> i'm not waiting
[1:28] <LuciferZ> Probably not, actually
[1:28] <XxPvtVainxX> but i guess that's the idea,
[1:28] <Dilt> Mosslander: Griefing is amazing
[1:28] <Malikat> i already have it
[1:29] <Malikat> because notch and i are like bros
[1:29] <rbos> I don't think it'll be as bad as some people make it out to be, but there will be griefing.
[1:29] <Dilt> The only real way to run a server is to only allow your bros in.
[1:29] <XxPvtVainxX> is to attack other people
[1:29] <XxPvtVainxX> :D
[1:29] <LuciferZ> A)Only purchasers can play B)Deletion takes tools and time and C)There will still be the option to kick and ban
[1:29] <Dilt> HEY Drakkar
[1:29] <Cial> Mosslander griefers will die by my sword
[1:29] <ZomBuster> everyone would dig in and raise up with full diamond gear
[1:29] <Mosslander> One word "fire".
[1:29] <XxPvtVainxX> I've payed for this,
[1:29] <Dilt> you and me drakkar
[1:29] <Dilt> we're gonna bro.
[1:29] <Malikat> LuciferZ <- this man is filled with right
[1:29] <Dilt> XxPvtVainxX: You get multiplayer :D
[1:29] <LuciferZ> :D
[1:29] <XxPvtVainxX> What?
[1:30] <Dilt> To be fair, multiplayer infdev will be easier to manage than creative.
[1:30] * Topple (Mibbit@adsl-222-161-222.clt.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[1:30] <XxPvtVainxX> Yeah,
[1:30] <Dilt> 1) griefing will be restricted due to survival limitations
[1:30] <Dilt> 2) accouunts must be paid, so banning the paid accounts will take one shot
[1:30] <LuciferZ> The fire thing might be a problem.
[1:30] <Dilt> and they can't just ban evade, unless they have multiple PAID accounts
[1:30] <Dilt> which gives notch money++
[1:30] <Mosslander> Once trees fall, it'll be easy to stop a rampaging fire.
[1:30] <ZomBuster> 3) no bloody hacks
[1:30] <Dilt> and you can just ban them again.
[1:30] <LuciferZ> But we don't know if it will even be possible in MP survival.
[1:30] <Dilt> there will always be 'hacks', but Notch can remove them given some programming time
[1:30] <LuciferZ> You might not be able to alter anyone elses blocks
[1:31] <Dilt> LuciferZ: If not, then I'll be angry with notch.
[1:31] <Dilt> Survival is all about stealing/betraying.
[1:31] <XxPvtVainxX> Guys, stop complaining about the "hackz" World of minecraft makes them, and i don't believe notch cares about that xD
[1:31] <Dilt> Creative, I can understand.
[1:31] <LuciferZ> All I'm saying is, we don't know.
[1:31] <Dysgalt> Do creepers have lawyers?
[1:31] <XxPvtVainxX> Nope
[1:31] <Dilt> Notch does care about it, when a lot of users complain about it.
[1:31] <XxPvtVainxX> Wut,
[1:31] <Dysgalt> hmm sucks for that creeper
[1:32] <Dilt> That being said, hacks for your own server and experimentation with friends? OK.
[1:32] <XxPvtVainxX> Wow..
[1:32] <XxPvtVainxX> xD
[1:32] <LuciferZ> hurhurhur
[1:32] <Dilt> Hacks for Griefing/Other servers that don't want it? Get off of Minecraft and go learn manners
[1:32] <Mosslander> Has any-one manages to generate a small, deep, island where you don't fall to your death at the start?
[1:32] <XxPvtVainxX> Well i just use the hacks to build
[1:32] <Dilt> Yeah. Nothing bad about that.
[1:32] <XxPvtVainxX> I don't like griefing either,
[1:32] <XxPvtVainxX> But then again i play indev more,
[1:32] <XxPvtVainxX> But i still don't grief,
[1:32] <Dysgalt> Notch said he would add a option for hacks..
[1:33] <Keiya> Why is Minecraft's in-game memorymeter stating that it;s using about 60% of 247mb of ram, but according to windows Java.exe is using 856,084 megs
[1:33] <XxPvtVainxX> Okay that's fair
[1:33] <Keiya> ?
[1:33] <Dysgalt> Keiya those are bytes
[1:33] <Dilt> Notch was going to take hacks, prevent the exploits they use, and then probably add in native features that can be toggled server-side to allow them.
[1:33] <XxPvtVainxX> Ohhh.

[2:40] <thechris> b messes me up, i always hit i
[2:40] <Animator> Survival is a demo. Kinda.
[2:41] <Slime> I like B more.

[2:41] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Survival is the up to date survival mode.
[2:41] <Slime> Survival is freebie shit. :l
[2:41] <Vis{ROTR2010}> InDev is IN DEVELOPMENT
[2:41] <Tarnak> heh...
[2:41] <thechris> go to youtube and look up indev
[2:41] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Slime: And that's the problem right now.
[2:41] <Slime> If you want to get technical.
[2:42] <Slime> Infdev is IN DEVELOPMENT.
[2:42] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Cool
[2:42] <Animator> Indev is far, far, far more advanced, though.
[2:42] <Vis{ROTR2010}> but it stands for INFINITE DEVELOPMENT.
[2:42] <thechris> i think it would be INFEVELOPMENT
[2:42] <Vis{ROTR2010}> That's the largest flaw in minecraft right now.
[2:42] <Slime> Which if you think about it doesn't make a lick of sense.
[2:42] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Notch isn't actually updating _anything_
[2:42] <Slime> There are no flaws to minecraft.
[2:42] <Slime> Shut your mouth.
[2:42] <Vis{ROTR2010}> He's just showing off his beta modes
[2:42] <Animator> Day and night, making tools, making crops, mining, fighting zombies, creepers sneaking up, skeletons more accurate.
[2:42] <Animator> And more.
[2:42] <Slime> Notch has been working hard.
[2:42] <thechris> besides theres no cake in it slime
[2:42] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and, for some reason, he has two of them.
[2:43] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Slime, do yourself a favor, stop being ignorant.
[2:43] <thechris> did you see his office?
[2:43] <thechris> 4 screens...
[2:43] <Tarnak> so the development version has all the NPCs and whatnot to fight/avoid/whatever then?
[2:43] <thechris> but a crappy keyboard XD
[2:43] <thechris> not human
[2:43] <Slime> Me? Ignorant?
[2:43] <thechris> no human NPCs yet
[2:43] <Animator> The same zombies as survival, only far more dangerous.
[2:43] <Slime> You're the one going "LOL INFDEV IS NOT UPDATES LOL."
[2:43] <Azathoth> thechris...
[2:43] <Animator> And monsters.
[2:43] <Azathoth> there's no such thing as a human npc
[2:43] <thechris> yes?
[2:44] <Tarnak> didn't say anything about humans but ok
[2:44] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Dumbassery, not ignorance, excuse me.
[2:44] <thechris> ...
[2:44] <Azathoth> the definition of an npc is that it's not a human player
[2:44] <Vis{ROTR2010}> InDev is an in development mode; it was created to show the things that Notch was developing BEFORE he put them into survival.
[2:44] <Azathoth> or wait
[2:44] <Vis{ROTR2010}> But there are things that he's NOT developing
[2:44] <Animator> Human mobs aren't in. Yet.
[2:44] <Azathoth> oh
[2:44] <Animator> Pretty soon Survival Multiplayer will be out.
[2:44] <thechris> i meant like game human, you know, like your caracter
[2:44] <Vis{ROTR2010}> things that he's NOT planning to change
[2:44] <Azathoth> i didn't realize human mobs were even planned
[2:44] <Vis{ROTR2010}> And they haven't been put into survival.
[2:45] <thechris> i think he said next week he will work on it
[2:45] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Then he mdae indev
[2:45] <Vis{ROTR2010}> fail
[2:45] <Vis{ROTR2010}> he MADE inFdev
[2:45] <thechris> he made indev and infdev
[2:45] <thechris> indev came first...
[2:45] <Tarnak> the price is in what, euros?
[2:45] <thechris> ya
[2:46] <Vis{ROTR2010}> InfDev was made to show things he planned to show things that he was working on before he added them to INDEV.
[2:46] <thechris> like 13, 14 dallors
[2:46] <Slime> It's roughly 13 USD
[2:46] <Tarnak> so $20 essentially?
[2:46] <Animator> It's $14.
[2:46] <Tarnak> ahh,
[2:46] <Azathoth> paypal will convert it to USD for you at the current rate.
[2:46] <Slime> ...
[2:46] <Animator> By the time it goes beta, it'll be $30.
[2:46] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Bullshit, good sir. He STOPPED working on indev and is rewriting the game in InfDev
[2:46] <Vis{ROTR2010}> so
[2:46] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Infdev is a beta
[2:46] <Vis{ROTR2010}> of a beta
[2:46] <Vis{ROTR2010}> of a beta
[2:46] <thechris> last time i checked it was 14.50
[2:46] <Slime> InfDev was an idea he took a poll on to start work on, Infdev will become the game.
[2:46] <Tarnak> yeah, I think I'll buy it. Probably get a week out of it at least
[2:46] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Because SURVIVAL is STILL a bug test
[2:46] * Azathoth wonders if people realize that infdev/indev/survival are not actually different things
[2:46] <Malikat> infdev is the latest dev release
[2:46] <Malikat> indev is an older dev release
[2:46] <Slime> Survival and Creative are nothing.
[2:47] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Azathoth: They ARE different things.
[2:47] <Malikat> survival and creative are public alphas
[2:47] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Azathoth: There's THREE of them
[2:47] <Tarnak> creative was... boring and pointless to me
[2:47] <Azathoth> they're all just different versions of the same thing :|
[2:47] <Slime> They're freebie tastes for the passers by to get a taste of minecraft.
[2:47] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Azathoth: Congratulations, you're understanding it
[2:47] <thechris> tarnak, i spend more time playing this game then games i pay $60 for
[2:47] <Animator> But they're still different.
[2:47] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Survival > Indev > Infdev
[2:47] * thechris highfives azathoth
[2:47] <Vis{ROTR2010}> One thing in three different stages of development
[2:47] <Cial> same here thechris
[2:47] <Malikat> survival and indev however, are obsolete.
[2:48] <thechris> i think i spent more time playing minecraft then my whole ps3
[2:48] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Malikat: Bullshit, no?
[2:48] <Vis{ROTR2010}> THREE MODES for ONE GAME

[2:48] <Azathoth> they're just different versions

[2:49] <Slime> About six people here are telling you you're wrong and you're beating yourself against a wall saying "DURR HURR I'M RITE I'M RITE I'M RITE."
[2:49] <thechris> yup

[2:57] <Tarnak> location* not position

[2:58] <Slime> >.>
[2:58] <Tarnak> One more question though, I've read here that there's both indev and infdev... I assume the link on the home page took me to indev since that's what was proclaimed on the start page. So what's infdev?
[2:58] <Animator> Do you know what I do to cats that fight? I neuter them.
[2:58] <Slime> Vis was fighting. With everyone.
[2:58] <eritz> take the indev URL

[2:58] <Slime> To explain infdev, Tarnak.
[2:59] <Cial> hey im trying to stay out of this

[2:59] <Slime> You just have to see it, and you'll understand entirely.
[2:59] <Animator> Vis, stop catfighting with everyone or I'll neuter you.
[2:59] <Tarnak> ok....
[2:59] <Azathoth> eritz, i'm not really sure either. maybe because until lately it hasn't been stable enough to actually PLAY

[3:00] <Azathoth> also, for me it doesn't exit completely. i have to kill java from the task manager after playing it

[3:20] <blaster> What do you think I am trying to do?
[3:20] <LuciferZ> You have all these subforums and no one to write in them. You're doing it backwards.
[3:20] <blaster> some people have posted a few times
[3:20] * Eagle (Eagle@c-24-56-216-207.customer.broadstripe.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:20] <LuciferZ> You get people and then you make subforums when the forums overflow.
[3:20] <blaster> Should I hide everything that isnt posted in?
[3:20] <LuciferZ> No, you should start with as few boards as possible.
[3:21] <LuciferZ> Keep the whole general section
[3:21] <blaster> How about guests, video games, news and off topic?
[3:21] <Dys|dinner> hmm I wonder what would happen

[4:49] <CruelNoise> okay, now i understand
[4:49] <CruelNoise> i thought it was a game.
[4:49] <vurtual> It's a sport.
[4:49] <vurtual> an awesome sport
[4:49] <vurtual> I can be like "I play sports" to people now and they'll be like "woah"
[4:49] <vurtual> And I'll say "quake" and then they'll be like ".." but then I'll list the "normal" sports, and things that aren't quite sports
[4:49] <vurtual> then I will be popular
[4:50] <CruelNoise> i don't really know anything about QL...
[4:50] <CruelNoise> why is this computer a crap?
[4:52] * Splatticus wanders over to QL...
[4:52] <PuyoDead> Oh yea, I Bet QL works right on this machine.

[4:54] <vurtual> *cough*

[4:55] <PuyoDead> Suuuure.
[4:55] <vurtual> back in my day I was an amazing shot
[4:55] <CruelNoise> vurtual, how old are you?
[4:55] <vurtual> if a gun could headshot I would headshot, no matter where I was, or how fast I was.
[4:55] <vurtual> the tau cannon was quite simply put my favorite weapon
[4:55] <Vis{ROTR2010}> But guns CAN'T headshot.
[4:55] <Vis{ROTR2010}> And, back in your day?
[4:56] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Erm.
[4:56] <vurtual> 1 ammo for an instant headshot kill on an unarmored opponet? Charge for an always kill? FLY THROUGH THE AIR!?
[4:56] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I smell more lies
[4:56] <PuyoDead> The best guy I've ever played with (finished first with his clan in the US in RtCW) didn't even get that high.
[4:57] <vurtual> on the other hand it was a teamplay server where I did that alot, and people didn't change player models too much, so there'd be like two big groups mostly
[4:57] <vurtual> and gauss jumping lets you shoot lots of people easily
[4:57] <CruelNoise> how do you kick bots in practice?
[4:57] <vurtual> "kick"

[4:57] <vurtual> try capitals

[4:57] <CruelNoise> no...
[4:58] <vurtual> no quotes?
[4:58] <vurtual> check the player list now
[4:58] <PuyoDead> Did you use / ?
[4:58] <CruelNoise> i didn't have quotes
[4:58] <vurtual> use the console

[5:01] <PuyoDead> And UT3 Black's IH is just awesome.
[5:01] <vurtual> does holding down mouse2 make it charge up a swing
[5:01] <PuyoDead> It's a lot like Quake, really. Just with more objectives (well, objectives AT ALL) and vehicles.
[5:01] <CruelNoise> doom was kicked; Doom: beam me up scottie
[5:01] <CruelNoise> lolwut
[5:02] <vurtual> I wouldn't call ut like quake

[5:08] <vurtual> the level deisgn
[5:08] <vurtual> just reminded me of old games so much
[5:08] <EmpiresBane> unfortunately, i'm on a laptop, so I can't really access it
[5:08] <PuyoDead> Yea, there's a lot of Quake feeling to UT.
[5:09] <PuyoDead> Even though they're like siblings who never talk to each other.
[5:09] * Bradness is now known as PixelEater
[5:09] <PuyoDead> Oh, and UT3Black is $20 on Steam.
[5:09] <vurtual> not quake feeling
[5:09] <vurtual> just...other old games
[5:09] <vurtual> the original unreal
[5:09] <vurtual> other games I played for a bit
[5:10] <somethingggg> So yeah notch needs to optimize his code before releasing updates.
[5:10] <somethingggg> Just sayin'.
[5:10] <Fractal> got unreal pack of steam when it was cheap, Unreal (gold) is surprisingly good
[5:10] <PuyoDead> Optimizations to the development testing version of an alpha?
[5:11] <EmpiresBane> somethingggg, it's in INfDEV
[5:11] <EmpiresBane> as in, IN DEVelopment
[5:11] <DimJim> Okay, I just put a bunch of torches on top of my tree fort, should I be safe?
[5:11] <EmpiresBane> not really
[5:11] <DimJim> As in open the inventory screen, watch some youtube videos and wait until day safe?
[5:11] <somethingggg> What does that have to do with what I said, moron?
[5:12] <KodaichiZero> "Infinite Development"
[5:12] <somethingggg> Rather than updating, then optimizing code
[5:12] <KodaichiZero> aka, Notch's destardly plans
[5:12] <somethingggg> he needs to optimize before releasing updates
[5:12] <vurtual> I wonder how many people own half-life 2 on steam
[5:12] <EmpiresBane> KodaichiZero, no. because indev isn't infinite
[5:12] <PuyoDead> *sigh*
[5:12] <somethingggg> cause right now its unplayable
[5:12] <Factoree> Ehh
[5:12] <KodaichiZero> lol.
[5:12] <DimJim> It's fine for me.
[5:12] <KodaichiZero> I can play it
[5:12] <somethingggg> unplayable for those with quad core computer with 8+ Gigs of RAM, then
[5:12] <KodaichiZero> it's not the area that's infinite
[5:12] <Splatticus> QL is at 34%
[5:12] <somethingggg> without*
[5:12] <DimJim> Uh.
[5:12] <somethingggg> Whatever.
[5:12] <EmpiresBane> no, the point is that it's not even supposed to be playable
[5:12] <KodaichiZero> it's the development that's infinite
[5:13] <DimJim> I have a dual-core with 4 gigs.
[5:13] <EmpiresBane> it's a sneak peek
[5:13] <somethingggg> Point is, it's badly needed.
[5:13] <Factoree> "InfDev" sounds like a cool name for a game studio.
[5:13] <somethingggg> Yes it is, empires
[5:13] <KodaichiZero> ie, the game will never actually come out of development
[5:13] <vurtual> Splatticus upfront I'm going to tell you some fun maps: qzdm6, qzdm5, qztourney5, and qzdm12 if you don't get anyone camping the bfg

[5:13] <EmpiresBane> optimizations are mainly for beta
[5:13] <KodaichiZero> he thought I was serious 0_o
[5:13] <Splatticus> Somethingggggg it did update.
[5:14] <KodaichiZero> I actually trolled him right out of the server...
[5:14] <Splatticus> Today.

[5:15] <Achooticus> Awesome idea.
[5:15] <vurtual> at my current rate of scoring, playing whenever I'm in a good playing mood, I'd get it sorta quickly. Granted, one screwup and I'll start sucking.
[5:15] <vurtual> minecraft powerups
[5:15] <EmpiresBane> oh god! it's a lagfest
[5:15] <vurtual> in dungeons
[5:15] <KodaichiZero> sure
[5:15] <Achooticus> Vurt no.

[5:16] <vurtual> dig 10k blocks get level for a perk to call AC130
[5:16] <KodaichiZero> maybe you could get a 4 by 4 crafting table
[5:16] <Achooticus> You get a tab of inventory.
[5:16] <KodaichiZero> for the really hard stuff

[5:16] <Animator> Don't make me pull out my pimpin' hand. I've undergone intensive surgery on all 4 of my knuckles on my right hand into iron rods just to backhand-slap you even harder.
[5:16] <Achooticus> Maybe just cool stuff. Like if you craft 10 times, Your crafting table turns to stone.
[5:16] <vurtual> Animator I've done that for every cell in my body
[5:16] <Achooticus> If you craft 50 times, it turns to bronze.
[5:17] <vurtual> I could simeltaneously slap you in multiple dimensions this way
[5:17] <Achooticus> If you craft 100 times, Silver.
[5:17] <Animator> You're not Wolverine, vurtual.
[5:17] <EmpiresBane> oh i see... it's the chunk loading thats causing the lag
[5:17] <Malikat> Achooticus: that would be cool
[5:17] <KodaichiZero> I've got balls of steel.
[5:17] <Achooticus> If you craft 500 times, Gold.
[5:17] <vurtual> every molecule
[5:17] <Malikat> unless it actually did something
[5:17] <vurtual> my eyelid is a warhammer
[5:17] <Malikat> if it were just to look cool, it would be awesome
[5:17] <KodaichiZero> and I'm all out of chewing gum
[5:17] <Achooticus> I think the table would just be for looks.
[5:17] <vurtual> and a clamp
[5:17] <Animator> Wouldn't you weigh too much to even move, anyway?
[5:17] <vurtual> So I see you doin' somethin' I don' like, you get clamped.
[5:17] <Achooticus> Or maybe a smelter.
[5:17] <Achooticus> Furnace.
[5:17] <Malikat> CLAMP?
[5:17] <Achooticus> You furnace two times.
[5:17] <KodaichiZero> My minecraft dream last night had crazy ideas
[5:17] * vurtual blinks menacingly
[5:17] <Malikat> i'mma CLAMP HIM
[5:17] <Achooticus> Ten times rather.
[5:17] <Achooticus> It turns to iron.
[5:18] * vurtual blinks Malikat in the upper left arm! It is torn asunder!
[5:18] <KodaichiZero> like
[5:18] <vurtual> here's an idea for crafting
[5:18] <Malikat> oh god i had a dream that i was playing minecraft
[5:18] <Malikat> but it was multiplayer
[5:18] <vurtual> a weapons workbench that's extra big and only does weapons
[5:18] <Malikat> and survival
[5:18] <Malikat> and halo 3
[5:18] <vurtual> and you can make spears and pikes
[5:18] <Achooticus> FFF gf is home head for the hills.
[5:18] <Malikat> all combined
[5:18] <KodaichiZero> I think notch should include material shaping as a system
[5:18] <Animator> Oh please. My Minecraft dream is even more crazier.
[5:18] <vurtual> Achooticus you mean to add "get some" after "home"
[5:18] <KodaichiZero> so you have to make the parts before you put them together
[5:18] * Animator pulls out the storybook.
[5:18] <Animator> So I was playing in some server in a dream.
[5:19] <Animator> And a dude pops into a server.
[5:19] <Malikat> i was on top of a platform watching for elites and grunts to come in through the hole in the ceiling
[5:19] <EmpiresBane> i've never had a minecraft dream...
[5:19] * Factoree hops on animator's lap.
[5:19] * KodaichiZero grabs the nearest bucket of popcorn
[5:19] <EmpiresBane> you guys play waaayyy too much
[5:19] <Malikat> and there were like 20 people on the ground clearing
[5:19] <Malikat> and we had fuel rod launchers etc
[5:19] <Animator> And builds a laser machine, equipt with knobs and everything.
[5:19] <Animator> And it was fully, functional.

[5:20] <KodaichiZero> oh jesus
[5:20] <Malikat> lol griefed
[5:20] <IDTL> Played inf dev for the first time in ages
[5:20] <IDTL> holy shit awesome
[5:20] <Malikat> Animator your dream server got griefed
[5:20] * EmpiresBane realizes his dream experiments were a success.
[5:20] <vurtual> I had a dream where we were some adventurers
[5:20] <vurtual> final fantasy style ones
[5:20] <vurtual> like the first one
[5:20] <Animator> Everything was griefer down by a person who built a fully functional laser that was aimable.
[5:20] * EmpiresBane starts backing away before Animator discovers the truth.
[5:20] <Animator> And the scary part is.
[5:20] <vurtual> and one of us had a dragon and he was some sort of elemental-super-important thing and he was col
[5:20] <Animator> It felt like I was behind the machine in the first place.
[5:20] <vurtual> and we fuond a gate, but it was a df-esque world
[5:20] <vurtual> and nearby monsters came out
[5:20] * Factoree Had a dream in which Minecrafters fought humans.
[5:20] <vurtual> and there was a waterfall in this area
[5:21] <vurtual> below it was hfs.
[5:21] <vurtual> and at one point I had a boner or something dunno why

[5:21] <KodaichiZero> In my dream, some dude taught me how to make a gigantic spear (equipment) and once I crafted it, I beat him in a fight using it. Then I drowned trying to harvest diamond ingots underwater.
[5:21] <IDTL> We should be able to rub two sticks together to create a one-time fire
[5:21] <primis> lol
[5:22] <primis> I think that would be a gay inuendo
[5:22] <Animator> We already have that with iron and flint.
[5:22] <EmpiresBane> or maybe you could craft 2 sticks together
[5:22] <IDTL> Animator, I mean like when you're scouting a map at night
[5:22] <IDTL> you could light up some areas
[5:22] <IDTL> like if you just started the ma p
[5:23] <Animator> Torches. And flames don't last forever anyway.
[5:23] <Animator> It'd be a waste of sticks unless you set a tree on fire.
[5:23] <IDTL> Torches won't last forever eventually anyway
[5:23] <Animator> But they last far longer than flames.
[5:23] <IDTL> They're going to get nerfed
[5:23] <Animator> Faaaaaar longer.
[5:23] <EmpiresBane> well aren't you just a poop, Animator
[5:23] <IDTL> and replaced by lanterns
[5:23] <Animator> If lanterns are implemented.
[5:24] <ClassiestMedic> guys
[5:24] <ClassiestMedic> please try out my server
[5:24] <KodaichiZero> torches will probably eventually have some visual indication of exactly how much time they have left

[5:26] <LuciferZ> Failed to connect, Classiest.
[5:26] <LuciferZ> Did you forward your ports?
[5:26] <ClassiestMedic> Damn
[5:26] <ClassiestMedic> Yes
[5:27] <LuciferZ> Are you sure you did it right, lol?
[5:27] <Achooticus> But as I was saying.
[5:27] <Achooticus> A furnace.
[5:27] <ClassiestMedic> no
[5:27] <ClassiestMedic> xD
[5:27] <LuciferZ> Lol
[5:27] <KodaichiZero> i dont think i can connect
[5:27] <Achooticus> That once you smelt like 10 times, it turns into iron.
[5:28] <Factoree> The furnace turns into iron?
[5:29] <Achooticus> 50 times: Turns into Gold, Becomes a double-decker and has two smelt slots, two fuel slots, and two return slots. Smelt 100 times, Turns into Obsidian. Flames turn.. Some cool color. Green, or maybe blue. Blue would go better with the obsidian. Smelt 500 times, It turns into diamond, becomes like, a super mega furnace and has a like, 4 slot setup.
[5:29] <rbos> oh, so the smelter becomes better the more you use it?
[5:29] <Achooticus> This is my idea for "Minecraft Unlocks."
[5:29] <ClassiestMedic> and it takes less fuel
[5:29] <Achooticus> No.
[5:30] <rbos> I think if there were to be upgradeable furnaces, adding material to it, or putting furnace+mats onto a crafting table, would be better.
[5:30] <ClassiestMedic> Yeah
[5:30] <Achooticus> You can do more, doesn't reduce cost. That would be lame.
[5:30] <rbos> say, furnace+a few gold bars makes it faster, or something.

[5:31] <Primis> umm gold is actually really bad for a high temp area
[5:31] <rbos> yeh, I'd like iron+coal -> steel :)
[5:31] <Primis> gold = melt fast

[5:31] <Achooticus> Etc.
[5:31] <Kokopure> Achooticus wants some sort of experience system?
[5:31] <Achooticus> Creepers.. I don't know.
[5:31] <Achooticus> No.
[5:31] <Factoree> Achooticus, I think that idea would be good for an RPG kindof mode.
[5:31] <Achooticus> EXP's already out.
[5:32] <Achooticus> This is like rewards.
[5:32] <Achooticus> You'd lose them once you died, which would make it.. rewarding.
[5:32] <Achooticus> Idk.
[5:32] <Achooticus> I have this whole perception based around the score system.
[5:33] <KodaichiZero> playing online alpha survival for the lulz
[5:33] <KodaichiZero> never tried it
[5:33] <Achooticus> It's not working for me.
[5:33] <Factoree> The guy in alpha survival uses his hands as a bow.
[5:33] <Factoree> His broken fingers as the drawstring.
[5:33] <Factoree> He shoots the arrows with his legs.
[5:34] <vurtual> he throws them
[5:34] <vurtual> with his teeth
[5:34] <vurtual> he has no arms
[5:34] <vurtual> he is... the creeper
[5:35] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Creepers have arms
[5:35] <Vis{ROTR2010}> duh
[5:35] <Vis{ROTR2010}> they're just hidden
[5:35] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and incredbly tiny
[5:35] <vurtual> arms everywhere
[5:35] <vurtual> flailing
[5:35] <Vis{ROTR2010}> yesh
[5:35] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Ivy?
[5:35] <Vis{ROTR2010}> no
[5:35] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Arms? yes.
[5:36] <Animator> I still think creepers are the culmination of vines wrapping over the corpse of a dead pig and reincarnating it with the sediments left over to create gunpowder and natural chemicals to make explosions.

[5:37] <Achooticus> F5 in Survival mode I mean!
[5:37] <Animator> Very old.
[5:37] <Achooticus> Omg rain.
[5:37] <Achooticus> D:
[5:37] <Achooticus> Do like.
[5:37] <Animator> You can do it in servers, too.
[5:37] <Achooticus> Put in infdev nao pls.
[5:37] <KodaichiZero> hmm
[5:38] <KodaichiZero> I'm not sure I have it working
[5:38] <KodaichiZero> it's not as simple as replacing the jars, is it?
[5:38] <vurtual> nowhere near
[5:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I hope notch makes some sort of vehicle after multiplayer
[5:38] <vurtual> decompile and recompile
[5:38] <vurtual> Polygonal vehicles
[5:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> It doesn't have to be a car
[5:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Maybe a mine cart
[5:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> maybe a boat
[5:38] <vurtual> it could be anything!
[5:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> but infinite maps need SOME way to scale them
[5:39] <vurtual> Even a minecart!
[5:39] <vurtual> And you know how everyone's always taken the minecart!
[5:39] <vurtual> wanted*
[5:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I wish he would hurry with infdev
[5:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> so he can start adding things
[5:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> :D
[5:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> :\ And those trees were half-assed or alot of work
[5:39] <Animator> Notch was thinking about Minecarts.
[5:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> because there's no branch blocks
[5:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> D:
[5:40] <Animator> Even discussed in an interview on concepts of implementation.
[5:40] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Yes
[5:40] <Vis{ROTR2010}> And mobs = ahh!
[5:40] <Factoree> I enjoy the idea of laying tracks for transportation.

[5:53] <vurtual> do it

[5:53] <vurtual> Tarnak in indev they do sometimes
[5:53] <vurtual> not perfectly
[5:53] <vurtual> but they can
[5:53] <vurtual> ok now someone suggest to me a map to play quake live with
[5:54] <Tarnak> but not infdev?
[5:54] <vurtual> not always
[5:54] <vurtual> they can break
[5:54] <vurtual> but they're resistant

[5:54] <Fractal> anyway, got to go sleep

[5:55] <vurtual> ok there are still maps too scary for me
[5:56] <EmpiresBane> Tarnak, the closer to the source you are, the stronger the explosian is
[5:56] <EmpiresBane> i believe iron blocks are invincible
[5:56] <vurtual> no you can break them too
[5:56] <EmpiresBane> wait! i wonder if gold blocks are?
[5:56] <vurtual> hard to, but you can potentially
[5:56] <vurtual> gold's breakable really easily dude
[5:56] <EmpiresBane> by explosian?
[5:56] <vurtual> anyways yeah arena gate and lost world are too creepy for me
[5:57] <Malikat> masonry is probably going to be close to explosion-proof
[5:57] <EmpiresBane> we're talking about tnt and creepers
[5:57] <EmpiresBane> gold would have an actual use if it was invincible to explosin
[5:58] <EmpiresBane> also, you could just do a checker-board pattern to save on materials while keeping mobs out

[6:03] <Azathoth> stupid
[6:03] <Malikat> but it's on their front page

[6:08] <FakeSky> Paypal
[6:08] <Azathoth> but 9 thread should = 1 wool
[6:08] <Demaskus> not an option
[6:08] <Achooticus> Your mom's money.
[6:08] <AndrewPH> that's it
[6:08] <Azathoth> so it creates this loop
[6:08] <Azathoth> of disappearing thread
[6:08] <AndrewPH> Demaskus, Why isn't it possible?
[6:08] <Demaskus> because
[6:08] <Achooticus> Yes but it would make for easy bow.
[6:08] <AndrewPH> If you have a bank account, you can link them
[6:09] <AndrewPH> and pay using paypal then
[6:09] <Demaskus> even though i'm 18, my mom doesen't know jack about computers
[6:09] <vurtual> guys
[6:09] <Azathoth> so?
[6:09] <Achooticus> Can you trigger tnt with an arrow?

[6:09] <AndrewPH> Demaskus, um
[6:09] <Azathoth> go get one
[6:09] <Azathoth> you're 18.
[6:09] <Demaskus> she's scared to use fucking PAYPAL
[6:09] <AndrewPH> paypal doesn't need computer knowledge
[6:09] <Azathoth> steal her credit card
[6:09] <vurtual> what if you had like, workers not working directly for the company in some cases, but the workers themselves were some company, who went and worked for companies?
[6:09] <AndrewPH> tell her to suck a fat one
[6:09] <Achooticus> Today is a rage day.
[6:09] <Azathoth> if your mom's that paranoid, kill her
[6:09] <Azathoth> in her sleep
[6:09] <Demaskus> ...
[6:09] <Achooticus> So many people come in here and angry.
[6:09] <vurtual> no awake her in her sleep
[6:09] <Achooticus> Azathoth, thumbs up.
[6:09] <vurtual> as opposed to waking her when she's awake
[6:09] <AndrewPH> smoke and glow
[6:09] <vurtual> that'd cause a paradox

[6:11] <Achooticus> Since you are useless.
[6:11] <Malikat> get a fucking bank account
[6:11] <Demaskus> to the dev
[6:11] <Azathoth> is she also telling you to fuck bitches?
[6:11] <Achooticus> And have no balls, or ability to nag your mother like every child would.
[6:11] <Demaskus> fuck odd
[6:11] <Demaskus> fuck off
[6:11] <Azathoth> ask notch, if you can mail him
[6:11] <LuciferZ> Lol Azathoth
[6:11] <Malikat> it takes all of 15 minutes at a bank
[6:11] <LuciferZ> Fuck bitches, get money

[6:57] <Azathoth> YOU DON'T
[6:57] <AndrewPH> Um
[6:58] <alec> ?
[6:58] <AndrewPH> ^
[6:58] <LuciferZ> What?
[6:58] <EmpiresBane> i don't like how the first half-life had a easily apparent story
[6:58] <Azathoth> it's illegal
[6:58] <Azathoth> you'll get arrested
[6:58] <alec> how do u change block color?
[6:58] <AndrewPH> EmpiresBane, It actually kinda did
[6:58] <LuciferZ> Alec you're going to have to use more words
[6:58] <alec> why are there gallaries with them in it...
[6:58] <AndrewPH> It was told through the NPCs and actions
[6:58] <AndrewPH> while doom
[6:58] <LuciferZ> Because the little ones you're using are not tell me enough
[6:58] <AndrewPH> Doom was more of a fuck shit up
[6:58] <LuciferZ> telling*
[6:58] <Azathoth> andrew, i think he said he DIDN'T like how it told a story
[6:58] <Azathoth> as in... he doesn't like stories apparently
[6:58] <alec> how do i change the color of blocks on minecraft?
[6:59] <Azathoth> alec, i don't even know what you mean
[6:59] <alec> .....
[6:59] <AndrewPH> alec, it's clientside
[6:59] <AndrewPH> nobody else can see it
[6:59] <LuciferZ> As in, make the blocks look different? Texture mods?
[6:59] <AndrewPH> you modify terrain.png
[6:59] <AndrewPH> in minecraft.jar
[6:59] <AndrewPH> in yoru appdata
[6:59] <alec> i can see it on alot of things...
[6:59] <EmpiresBane> no wait, i saud that wrong
[6:59] <AndrewPH> EmpiresBane, It's ok I read your mind
[6:59] <alec> where can i find terrain.png?
[6:59] <Azathoth> i'm not sure if he's even asking about how to change the skins or if he's just asking how to use different block types
[6:59] <alec> how to change block typed
[6:59] <EmpiresBane> although, HL2 was much better
[6:59] <alec> types
[7:00] <LuciferZ> Alec: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=2358

[7:01] <vurtual> bad company 2
[7:01] <vurtual> but with wind
[7:01] <LuciferZ> That describes it perfectly
[7:02] <Azathoth> yeah
[7:02] <vurtual> or a zelda game without rolling/epona
[7:02] <Azathoth> um. sure
[7:02] <LuciferZ> Zelda game with a world that is actually big.
[7:02] <LuciferZ> And not about 100 yards across.
[7:02] <vurtual> "LINK YOU HAVE TO GO TO SOME FAR AWAY PLACE" *no horse* *walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk walk*
[7:02] <Azathoth> a zelda game without rolling blunts?
[7:03] <Azathoth> but link cannot take silt striders!
[7:03] <alec> ok i looked at link
[7:03] <alec> and i see there are alot of terrains already
[7:03] <alec> how do i switch between terains.?
[7:03] <Azathoth> the ones that come with the game?
[7:03] <vurtual> twilight princess gave you a horse pretty quickly so it made up for the mildly large world which IS A GIGANTIC C SHAPE FOR MOST OF IT
[7:03] <alec> yes
[7:03] <Azathoth> what version are you playing?
[7:03] <alec> like water and sane
[7:03] <alec> sand
[7:03] <chibifs> hay guys

[7:03] <vurtual> mousewheel
[7:03] <Azathoth> the latest development version?
[7:03] <alec> yes
[7:04] <Azathoth> erm
[7:04] <alec> the version u buy
[7:04] <alec> idk
[7:04] <vurtual> You could easily just be stuck in some place with a broken bridge and doors and such and have to spend an hour riding back, because you thought you could take a scenic route
[7:04] <Azathoth> you can't access all the different block types in that one
[7:04] <LuciferZ> Alec: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=3029
[7:04] <alec> ive seen water and alot of stuff before...
[7:04] <Azathoth> you have to actually gather the different stuff yourself.
[7:04] <EmpiresBane> you must mine the material
[7:04] <vurtual> dig them up
[7:04] <LuciferZ> That's a downloadable program
[7:04] <LuciferZ> That will swap textures for you
[7:04] <Azathoth> that's not what he wants
[7:04] <Azathoth> alec, if you want to just build shit with all the block types, play creative
[7:04] <EmpiresBane> this is why i'm making a tutorial...

[7:15] * DrEarthmover (nevanlanos@72.171.45.79) has joined #minecraft
[7:15] <Azathoth> he's an 8 year old. done
[7:15] <LuciferZ> But no one can understand what he wants
[7:15] <chibifs> I'm 12 and what is this?
[7:15] <Azathoth> hah
[7:15] <LuciferZ> After like, twenty minutes of guessing
[7:16] <LuciferZ> We figure out that he wants to be able to place water
[7:16] <LuciferZ> And then ClassiestMedic tries to explain CheatEngine to him
[7:16] <LuciferZ> But he can't because first we have to explain IRC to him
[7:16] <Azathoth> i wonder if he's actually talking to him in PM still
[7:16] <LuciferZ> And then he quits
[7:16] * Primis is now known as Primis|sleep
[7:16] <TestDummy> Kill it with fire.
[7:17] <Azathoth> <alec> wait hes hacking me?
[7:17] <LuciferZ> I think he really was like, six.
[7:17] <Azathoth> no kidding
[7:17] <LuciferZ> <alec>screw this!
[7:17] <Azathoth> he was so oblivious
[7:17] <LuciferZ> He kept calling indev 'the game i bought'
[7:18] <Azathoth> omg. the best part was when he wanted to change the terains on his guy
[7:18] <LuciferZ> And we all thought he meant his character skin
[7:18] <LuciferZ> But somehow he didn't
[7:18] <Azathoth> i still don't know what he meant by those two lines
[7:18] <Azathoth> he never really clarified
[7:19] <LuciferZ> It was weird
[7:19] <LuciferZ> It was weird and awesome
[7:19] <Azathoth> yep
[7:19] <TestDummy> If he thinks you're hacking him, you should see what happens when he meets me.
[7:19] <LuciferZ> I told him to go lie down until he was different. I think I'll keep using that.
[7:20] <Azathoth> he'll need to lie down for at least 6 more years o_O
[7:20] <Azathoth> ah man
[7:20] <Cial> lol i just read the logs to catch up
[7:20] <Azathoth> if he is a little kid, i do feel kinda bad talking shit
[7:20] <Azathoth> but it's so hilarious.
[7:20] <Cial> we get some damn fine examples of the human race here
[7:20] <Azathoth> indeed
[7:20] <LuciferZ> What, no. If he's NOT a little kid I feel bad.

[7:23] <Azathoth> anyone got $25 to spare? i want to be playing oblivion instead of morrowind D:
[7:23] <Dommys> I can only enjoy Minecraft Livestreams if it's accompanied by tasteful music and erratic gameplay and insane cackling.
[7:23] <Azathoth> and erotic gameplay
[7:24] <Dommys> Azathoth

[7:24] <LuciferZ> Oblivion on PC destroys Morrowind
[7:24] <Dommys> "Hey guise.. can someone lend me moniez so that I can play a WORSE game than the one I already have?"
[7:24] <Azathoth> oblivion just feels empty. and i'd rather not read 18 pages of text every conversation -_-
[7:24] <Azathoth> err
[7:24] <Azathoth> morrowind*
[7:24] <Dommys> Stfu. go play Daggerfall.
[7:24] <Dommys> lol
[7:25] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Morrowind ftw
[7:25] <Vis{ROTR2010}> if you get the right mods
[7:25] <Azathoth> oblivion is way superior, imo
[7:25] <Vis{ROTR2010}> otherwise it is empty
[7:25] <LuciferZ> Daggerfall is penis
[7:25] <Dommys> Graphically.
[7:25] <Vis{ROTR2010}> arena ftw?
[7:25] <Dommys> Daggerfall has no penises.. Unless you patch them in <3
[7:25] <Azathoth> oblivion is less frustrating
[7:25] <Azathoth> morrowind is just like
[7:25] <Azathoth> shitty combat
[7:25] <LuciferZ> Azathoth, if you get Oblivion, download everything on TexNexus
[7:25] <Azathoth> hope the RNG favors you
[7:25] <Dommys> I'm honestly not a fan of Morrowind or Oblivion.
[7:25] <LuciferZ> Er TesNexus
[7:25] <Dommys> Also, Azathoth, why the fuck are you buying games, if you lack money
[7:25] <LuciferZ> And then stream so I can see.
[7:26] <Dommys> Go pirate that shit like the rest of the world.
[7:26] <Azathoth> i don't know why they'd even make a first person game if it's just going to be rolling random numbers for everything. they could've just made it isometric or something
[7:26] <Azathoth> i don't pirate shit
[7:26] <LuciferZ> What if I pirated shit
[7:26] <Dommys> Oh, you're that guy?
[7:26] <LuciferZ> And then sold it to you
[7:26] <Azathoth> yes, i'm that guy
[7:26] <Dommys> Sorry.. I knew someone here was "that way"
[7:27] <Dommys> I just forgot whom it was.
[7:27] <Azathoth> lol
[7:27] <LuciferZ> Lol
[7:27] <Azathoth> i'm not the only one
[7:27] <Cial> to slow of a connection to pirate stuff
[7:27] <LuciferZ> "that way"
[7:27] <Dommys> I pirate the fuck out of big name games.. especially this long after release.
[7:27] <Azathoth> i don't
[7:27] <AndrewPH> Azathoth, Morrowind is DnD in 3d p. much.
[7:27] <AndrewPH> deal w/ it
[7:27] <LuciferZ> Actually Azathoth, I think I have a copy
[7:28] <LuciferZ> A purchased copy
[7:28] <Azathoth> i have oblivion
[7:28] <LuciferZ> Then what the fuck are we talking abot?
[7:28] <Azathoth> i just want the goty deluxe edition on steam so i can get the amazing DLC like the horse armor!
[7:28] <Azathoth> actually, i don't have shivering isles or knights of the nine
[7:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Is Mirror's Edge worth the download?
[7:28] <Azathoth> yes
[7:28] <LuciferZ> Really, Azathoth? Really?
[7:28] <LuciferZ> Horse Armor?
[7:28] <Azathoth> yep
[7:29] <KodaichiZero> hey gaiz
[7:29] <Cial> wow
[7:29] <Dommys> Vis, not at all.
[7:29] <LuciferZ> There are like, fifty usermade horse armor mods available for free.
[7:29] <Azathoth> <Azathoth> actually, i don't have shivering isles or knights of the nine
[7:29] <LuciferZ> Shivering Isles is worth it
[7:29] <KodaichiZero> smells like a skunk in my room because my window's open
[7:29] <LuciferZ> Knights of the Nine was shit
[7:29] <Azathoth> that's probably you, kodaichi
[7:29] <AndrewPH> LuciferZ, I found it fun
[7:29] <Cial> i bought GOTY in a store so i dont have to fight with steam over it
[7:29] <KodaichiZero> nah
[7:29] <Azathoth> fight with steam?!
[7:29] <Dommys> "fight over steam"
[7:29] <KodaichiZero> I smell different
[7:29] <chibifs> Halp. I added -Xmx512m to my java but it is still running at 256 :(
[7:29] <Dommys> Get Broadband.
[7:29] <Vis{ROTR2010}> So
[7:29] <Dommys> Stop complaining.
[7:29] <Cial> Steam is a bitch
[7:30] <Azathoth> i prefer games on steam
[7:30] <Vis{ROTR2010}> What's good/bad about mirrors edge?
[7:30] <LuciferZ> It was fun, but not fun enough for it's price
[7:30] <Azathoth> that way i don't have to dig out discs and cd keys
[7:30] <AndrewPH> chibifs, you need a space proberly
[7:30] <LuciferZ> Shivering was epic though.
[7:30] <Dommys> Vis, It's not fun
[7:30] <Azathoth> i really enjoyed mirror's edge :S
[7:30] <Azathoth> but you know... different people have different opinions
[7:30] <AndrewPH> Dommys, It is if you like parkour games
[7:30] <Azathoth> dommy's opinion isn't always the only right one
[7:30] <LuciferZ> Vis, I heard it was awesome, but the combat ruined it.
[7:30] <Dommys> No, only one Opinion. Mine.
[7:31] <AndrewPH> LuciferZ, I liked the combat tbh
[7:31] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Hmm, I'll torrent it
[7:31] <Dommys> AndrewPH show me a Parkour game that doesn't suck balls
[7:31] <Vis{ROTR2010}> then we're fair
[7:31] <vurtual> Dommys, quake 3 arena.
[7:31] <Cial> Dommys: get broadband...right ill get right on that after i get the money for it and it comes to my area
[7:31] <LuciferZ> It didn't fit with the rest was what I heard. Like they tacked it on.
[7:31] <Dommys> THAT I can agree with
[7:31] <AndrewPH> Dommys, you don't like parkour games
[7:31] <AndrewPH> you won't like parkour games
[7:31] <AndrewPH> dela w/ it
[7:31] <Dommys> Cial, move sir.

[7:34] <Azathoth> dodes?
[7:34] <gear> an infinite server
[7:35] <Azathoth> erm
[7:35] * GMAmatsu is now known as Amatsu
[7:35] <AndrewPH> gear, you wouldn't be able to mine the rock
[7:35] <Azathoth> you wouldn't be able to use tools
[7:35] <gear> and everyone just builds an ever expanding underground fort
[7:35] * Amatsu is now known as GMAmatsu
[7:35] <Azathoth> which just gave me an idea
[7:35] <gear> ok please, you would get some starter stuff
[7:35] <AndrewPH> It would taking fucking forever to make a basic base
[7:35] <AndrewPH> you have no sticks
[7:35] <AndrewPH> you can't make more stuff
[7:35] <gear> sure you can
[7:35] <Azathoth> you should be able to use bones from things you kill as a stick replacement :D
[7:35] <AndrewPH> you need sticks
[7:35] <gear> you set it up so that every player starts with like 10 wood
[7:35] <Azathoth> how hardcore would that be?
[7:35] <LuciferZ> Start with shrubs.
[7:35] <gear> and a few shrubs
[7:35] <AndrewPH> gear, and when those run out?
[7:35] <Azathoth> and dirt...
[7:35] <LuciferZ> Eventually, make a tree farm
[7:35] <AndrewPH> shrubs need grass :1
[7:36] <LuciferZ> Oh yeah.
[7:36] <AndrewPH> grass needs other grass
[7:36] <gear> no
[7:36] <AndrewPH> yes
[7:36] <gear> they just need dirt
[7:36] <AndrewPH> prove it
[7:36] <LuciferZ> No, wait he's right, they grow on dirt
[7:36] <Azathoth> or how about the top of the map is a big flat plane of grass with trees growing
[7:36] <LuciferZ> I tried that.
[7:36] <Azathoth> but i still think using bones would work as a replacement for sticks
[7:36] <Azathoth> it would be hardcore
[7:37] <LuciferZ> Gear, I'm about to make a small map like that on Dysgalt's server.
[7:37] <gear> lol
[7:37] <gear> it would be better as inf survival
[7:37] <LuciferZ> I know. But I like making maps in creative and converting them to .mclevels.
[7:37] <gear> a colonizing the underground scenario!
[7:37] <Azathoth> there would have to be lots of caves dungeons and stuff
[7:38] <gear> well have to beg notch for some world generating settings
[7:38] <Azathoth> it would get boring just digging around in solid rock forever

[7:43] <LuciferZ> Hey Andrew, go to Server Administration and vouch for Dysgalt in the CTF software giveaway
[7:43] <Azathoth> ok this is getting too disturbing for me
[7:43] <Konogan> It now supports 4GB instead of 2.
[7:43] <AndrewPH> LuciferZ, no vote for me :1
[7:43] <Azathoth> congrats
[7:43] <Konogan> Thanks :D
[7:43] <LuciferZ> Oh, you asked for it too

[7:45] <Konogan> Azathoth, I tryed. What is done is done anyway.
[7:45] <Azathoth> :3
[7:45] <LuciferZ> Dysgalt you had better get that fucking server
[7:45] <Azathoth> it wasn't so much support for you as it was support for andrew's opponent!
[7:45] <AndrewPH> dysgalt isn't a D3 dev, lucifer
[7:45] <LuciferZ> Neither are you
[7:45] <AndrewPH> He's as much of a dev as I am
[7:46] <Azathoth> D3?
[7:46] <Dysgalt> Uhmm I helped make a couple things
[7:46] <AndrewPH> Dysgalt, you gave dadido ideas :P
[7:46] <LuciferZ> I just want him to have it so I can get us it with the RMM
[7:46] <Azathoth> d3?
[7:46] <Dysgalt> I made a mapfill though :(

[7:51] <Azathoth> thought it was something more epic than that :(
[7:51] <gear> it could become more

[7:55] <Yourself> <Azathoth> has anyone here ever made a random number generator before?
[7:55] <Yourself> why would you make your own?
[7:55] <Vicrry> Anyway, as soon as I restart I'll try Procaster again - won't let me disable without restarting
[7:55] <Azathoth> i don't know. maybe if you used some obscure language that didn't have one :\
[7:55] <Vicrry> And I has several servers running/being used :P
[7:55] <LuciferZ> Have you guys seen the dude building the Imperial City in infdev?
[7:56] <Yourself> there's a lot of involved math that usually goes into RNGs to make sure that they're statistically sound
[7:56] <Vaugher> Yea.
[7:56] <vurtual> scrolls?
[7:56] <Vaugher> Good luck to him.
[7:56] <Vaugher> That'll be hard.
[7:56] <Azathoth> i want someone to make new york city or something
[7:56] <LuciferZ> I want to play on his server when MP comes out.
[7:56] <vurtual> you know those guys making pokemon
[7:57] <LuciferZ> He's a dangerously singleminded man.
[7:57] <Vaugher> I'm making a gigantic tower that spawns from the bottom of a deep floating map to the top.
[7:57] <vurtual> port to infdev
[7:57] <Vaugher> But that's it.
[7:57] <vurtual> entirety of Japan, pokemon-form
[7:57] <Vaugher> *spans
[7:57] <vurtual> how many regions are there in pokemon so far
[7:57] <AndrewPH> a lot
[7:57] <vurtual> 8?
[7:58] <AndrewPH> how would that be possible with only 4 generations
[7:58] <Azathoth> vaugher, how would you even do that?
[7:58] <Azathoth> hacks?
[7:58] <vurtual> side-series
[7:58] <Vaugher> Nope. Only hacked for red cloth and some water.
[7:58] <vurtual> I know Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh
[7:58] <vurtual> the Orre, Almia, there's another
[7:58] <Azathoth> oh. water
[7:58] <Azathoth> cheater!
[7:58] <vurtual> gen 5's region would make 8 I could name
[7:59] <Vaugher> The walls were a little monotonous so I lined my big circular windows with red cloth tiles.
[7:59] <Vaugher> So yea, I cheated for those. And the dungeon entrance at the bottom needed some snazzyin' up so I gave myself a water block.
[7:59] <Azathoth> how did you even get to the bottom?
[7:59] <Vaugher> Spawned down there on generation.
[7:59] <Vaugher> Bu bottom I meant bottom island.
[7:59] <Azathoth> oh
[7:59] <Azathoth> ok
[7:59] <Vaugher> Not on the bottom with the water that kills you.
[8:00] <Konogan> Anyone can help me? I reinstalled windows on one of my HDD. I had some games installed on my other HDD, But those won't work (saying missing DLLs and such.). Is it possible to make them work withouth reinstalling?
[8:00] <Azathoth> you lost all your registry entries for them
[8:00] <Konogan> Yup.
[8:00] <Azathoth> and probably some dependencies i'd imagine
[8:01] <Konogan> Well.
[8:01] <LuciferZ> Does ANYONE here want to help me with a Venice-themed build?
[8:01] <Azathoth> no
[8:01] <Konogan> :\
[8:01] <Vaugher> Maybe.
[8:01] <LuciferZ> Gah. I just want to finish this damn map
[8:01] <LuciferZ> But I hate city builds now D:
[8:01] <Konogan> I was hoping there was maybe a tool for that.
[8:01] <Azathoth> like uh... visual studio runtimes
[8:01] <Vaugher> What exactly is it?
[8:01] <Azathoth> and that kind of stuff
[8:01] <Konogan> Like .NET.
[8:02] <Azathoth> yea
[8:02] <Vaugher> Oh? Work on my tower =P
[8:02] <Azathoth> the .net framework or whatever
[8:02] <Konogan> Yeah.
[8:02] <Azathoth> you probably just have to reinstall most of them though
[8:02] <Konogan> Shame.
[8:02] <Kokopure> Malikat
[8:03] <Kokopure> how are you liking the ten thousand creepers
[8:03] <Konogan> Oh well, at least the steam games work :P
[8:03] <Azathoth> yea
[8:03] <AndrewPH> <3
[8:03] <AndrewPH> steam
[8:03] <vurtual> Anyways the pokemon-world is basically the planet
[8:03] <Azathoth> <3 <3 steam
[8:03] <vurtual> msot of Japan, parts of Brazil
[8:03] <Konogan> The new steam is awesome too.
[8:03] <vurtual> an unidentified "America" which fought wars that had pokemon being used to... power vehicles
[8:03] <Azathoth> it is, but i have trouble with it on dual monitors
[8:03] <Konogan> the UI update.
[8:03] <LuciferZ> Why would they bother with that?
[8:04] <LuciferZ> Why not just use Entei or something to fuck everyone?
[8:04] <vurtual> wait bother with what
[8:04] <Azathoth> hentai?
[8:04] <vurtual> entei's pretty rare\
[8:04] <vurtual> and bullets can kill better than pokemon somehow

[8:04] <LuciferZ> That's dumb
[8:04] <Azathoth> um
[8:04] <Konogan> Rofl.
[8:04] <vurtual> well a shocky thing
[8:04] <Azathoth> not really
[8:04] <Azathoth> pokemon are weakasses
[8:05] <Azathoth> they're always fighting, but they never kill anything
[8:05] <Vicrry> Oh looks a ounce of supersonic lead. Try NOT to die.
[8:05] <vurtual> or a high velocity projectile, going FASTER THAN SOUND, INCREDIBLY HOT, impacting your flesh, and tearing up bodyparts?
[8:05] <Konogan> Technology > Pokemons.
[8:05] <vurtual> porygon should have had a shotgun attack
[8:05] <Azathoth> pokemons should start packin heat
[8:05] <vurtual> that hits a random amount of damage based on accuracy
[8:05] <vurtual> that deals super-damage which drains off a revive's hp on faint
[8:05] <Azathoth> pikachu's got a fuckin glock
[8:05] <Konogan> Anyway.
[8:05] <Azathoth> and a doo rag
[8:06] <Konogan> GTG now. Bye.
[8:06] <LuciferZ> Man, fuck glocks
[8:06] <Azathoth> bye
[8:06] <vurtual> so if you hit someone hard enough, they'd take multiple full revives to heal
[8:06] <LuciferZ> Glocks are shit
[8:06] <Azathoth> not if you're a g
[8:06] <LuciferZ> Especially if you're a g
[8:06] <vurtual> imagine 1hitting someone's super-strong everything-dies pokemon
[8:06] <Azathoth> sorry. i mean "not if yo a g"
[8:06] * Konogan is now known as Konogan|Sleep
[8:06] <vurtual> then they end up spending ages applying full revives
[8:06] <LuciferZ> Stupidity is no excuse!
[8:06] <vurtual> dawg real men use springfield armory man
[8:06] <vurtual> XD man, big bullet.
[8:06] <Azathoth> watev
[8:07] <Azathoth> real men use g36cs
[8:07] <LuciferZ> I like S&W personally.
[8:07] <vurtual> real men use ruger 10/22s
[8:07] <Konogan|Sleep> Real men use thompsons.
[8:07] <Konogan|Sleep> Anyway
[8:07] <vurtual> no no
[8:07] <LuciferZ> No way, Taurus Judges
[8:07] <Konogan|Sleep> I'm not here.
[8:07] <vurtual> Real men use a
[8:07] <vurtual> DEAGLE BRAND DEAGLE
[8:07] <Azathoth> and by real men
[8:07] <Azathoth> i mean GERMANS
[8:08] <Azathoth> the realest men there are
[8:08] <vurtual> not just any DEAGLE BRAND DEAGLE either
[8:08] <Vicrry> Real men don't use pussy pistols. They use carbines to effing pwn n00bz.
[8:08] <vurtual> A gold-plated and tigerstriped DEAGLE BRAND DEAGLE!
[8:08] <Azathoth> whatever man. the g36c is quite possibly the sexiest thing i've ever seen in my life ever
[8:08] <LuciferZ> Vicrry, there is no gun more badass than the S&W M500
[8:08] <Vicrry> And DEAGLE isn't the actual brand, Desert Eagles are manufactured by Magnum Research
[8:09] <vurtual> ...
[8:09] <vurtual> "DEAGLE BRAND DEAGLE"
[8:09] <vurtual> haven't you heard that line
[8:09] <Vicrry> nopes
[8:09] <vurtual> anyways real real real real real real real real real real real real real real men
[8:09] <vurtual> use a mossberg 500
[8:09] <Azathoth> i use a magnum
[8:09] <vurtual> And I do, myself, use a mossberg 500.
[8:09] <Azathoth> but not the gun
[8:09] <Yourself> real men use sandviches
[8:09] <vurtual> a very nice mossberg 500
[8:09] <LuciferZ> Fuck that, SPAS 12 if you're going pump
[8:09] <vurtual> good for hitting targets
[8:10] <vurtual> Z, the gun will break and jam on you
[8:10] <vurtual> it also weighs way more
[8:10] <vurtual> shotguns r heavy
[8:10] * Azathoth goes off to fap to a g36c
[8:10] <vurtual> m16>g36
[8:10] <Vicrry> Benelli M1014 is the fraggin win for shotguns
[8:10] <LuciferZ> Actually, nevermind, AA-12
[8:10] <Azathoth> g36 looks cooler
[8:10] <vurtual> a g36 is an ar-18 covered in plastic
[8:10] * revenant (dlukes@pool-74-111-168-109.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: sayounara)
[8:10] <Azathoth> well, the c model does. the other g36 models look kinda silly
[8:10] <vurtual> the m16 is the coolest looking un in existance
[8:10] <vurtual> how many people here have actually used any of the above guns
[8:10] <Azathoth> bah
[8:10] <Azathoth> none
[8:10] <vurtual> *cricket chirp*
[8:11] <vurtual> well then
[8:11] <LuciferZ> I've used the AA12, and the M16
[8:11] <vurtual> I am more experienced in this topic
[8:11] <Azathoth> did i ever say anything about performance?
[8:11] <LuciferZ> And the Taurus Judge but that was way earlier
[8:11] <Azathoth> you don't need to use something to know it looks damn sexy
[8:11] <vurtual> yes you do
[8:11] <vurtual> it's like a chick with riduclousl arge boobs
[8:11] <Vicrry> I've used the 30 M1 Carbine which is bleeding win :P
[8:11] <vurtual> seeing them, ok
[8:11] <LuciferZ> And I touched a S&W 500
[8:11] <LuciferZ> But I like my shoulder how it is
[8:11] <LuciferZ> So I didn't try it
[8:11] <vurtual> actually experiencing them? Not fun at all
[8:11] <Azathoth> well i'd rather have a g36c than an m16 any day
[8:11] <vurtual> unless they're real and somehow perky
[8:12] <vurtual> Azathoth you'll die for that
[8:12] <vurtual> you will, infact, die for a choice like that
[8:12] <vurtual> then you're gone
[8:12] <Vicrry> The 300 Weatherby is less fun to shoot rapidly :P
[8:12] <vurtual> the only way people will remember you is a corny speech and the hole you burned in their wallet.
[8:12] <Azathoth> nah man
[8:12] <LuciferZ> Depends on what version of the M16 we're talking about
[8:12] <vurtual> that's it.
[8:12] <vurtual> take the wrong thing
[8:12] <vurtual> waste weight
[8:12] <vurtual> and you are a dead person.
[8:12] <Azathoth> the serbian special forces use it. it must be good
[8:13] <LuciferZ> I touched the M16 serial number 1, and both 1000000's
[8:13] <vurtual> you will have bullets driven into your flesh, shattering bones and tearing flesh, breaking nerves, and causing immense pain and bleeding.
[8:13] <vurtual> then you will die
[8:13] <gear> i wanna see a lot of town features one day in minecraft
[8:13] <vurtual> Z
[8:13] <vurtual> I touched your mother.
[8:13] <Azathoth> and the pasukan gerakan khas counter-revolutionary warfare people of the royal malaysian police use it
[8:13] <LuciferZ> Suck that, vurtual
[8:13] <vurtual> :smug:
[8:13] <LuciferZ> *shrug*
[8:13] <LuciferZ> Get in line. This IRC makes that claim a lot
[8:13] <gear> im planning on buying an ar15
[8:13] <vurtual> smug backwards is gums
[8:13] <vurtual> gear your everyday ar-15 will not be great
[8:13] <vurtual> an m16 will be great
[8:13] <gear> i know
[8:13] <Azathoth> i wish i could buy a g36
[8:14] <vurtual> but an ar-15 itself otherwise is not great
[8:14] <gear> but im on a budget you know
[8:14] <vurtual> Azathoth are you Vis{ROTR2010} in disguise
[8:14] <vurtual> budget? guns?
[8:14] <Azathoth> no
[8:14] <Vicrry> Most of the civilian assault rifles aren't worth the trouble and price premium
[8:14] <gear> yes as a mater of factly
[8:14] <vurtual> you know I asked a guy once
[8:14] <vurtual> out of 3 gun lists
[8:14] <vurtual> (2 about good weapons, 1 about horrible weapons that are way overused in media and such)
[8:14] <vurtual> I asked him whcih weapon he would like most to use
[8:14] <vurtual> his choice was mateba
[8:15] <Azathoth> my choice is g36c
[8:15] <Dommys> loltaurus
[8:15] <LG_Legacy> What
[8:15] <Kokopure> um
[8:15] <Azathoth> i don't care if it melts your hands off when you overheat it by firing it too much
[8:15] <Azathoth> it's damn sexy
[8:15] <Kokopure> my skin isn't loaded anymore
[8:15] <vurtual> out of every durable AK variant, every legendary pistol, revolver, rifle, weapon
[8:15] <vurtual> his pick was mateba
[8:15] <Kokopure> is this true for everyone else
[8:15] <LuciferZ> Holyshit that thing is nice
[8:15] <Kokopure> anyone else*
[8:15] <LG_Legacy> Oh god dammit are we talking about guns? THIS IS #MINE- Wait what the hell am i doing? We do this every day
[8:15] <LuciferZ> I'd never even heard of a mateba
[8:15] <Dommys> Every god damned day
[8:15] <Azathoth> it's ugly
[8:15] <LuciferZ> But now I want one
[8:15] <vurtual> also panchor jackhammer was oen of his favorites
[8:15] <vurtual> Z, here's what happens
[8:16] <vurtual> it jams instantly half the time
[8:16] <Azathoth> i think pistols are just lame
[8:16] <vurtual> it shatters your hand due to "recoil channeling"
[8:16] <LuciferZ> Awesome.
[8:16] <Azathoth> especially revolvers
[8:16] <Dommys> Azathoth lol
[8:16] <LuciferZ> Azathoth you are atsteless whore
[8:16] <vurtual> and has none of the accuracy or reliability of a revolver
[8:16] <vurtual> it has no actual use on the entire planet
[8:16] <LuciferZ> Go eat shit and die
[8:16] <Azathoth> lol
[8:16] <Dommys> That revolver will fire every time. without fail.
[8:16] <Dommys> Well, for the most part ;P
[8:16] <vurtual> except the part where the mateba fails to function
[8:16] <vurtual> and that parts pretty popular but WHO CARES?
[8:16] <Azathoth> have fun spending 5 minutes reloading
[8:16] <Dommys> But a hell of a lot less issues than a semi auto.
[8:16] <vurtual> IT can recock the hammmmemrrrr
[8:16] <Dommys> Quick loaders?
[8:16] <LuciferZ> When you're trying to throw out an execution line with your faggot g36
[8:17] <vurtual> Azathoth it takes a few seconds to slide the bullets in
[8:17] <LuciferZ> I hope you realize how fucking retarded you are
[8:17] <Dommys> It takes me less time to reload my 38 than it does my 9mm
[8:17] <Vicrry> Panchor Jackhammers might be fun to think about, but it's got problems
[8:17] <Azathoth> at least i'll look cool doing it, lucifer XD
[8:17] <LuciferZ> There are better autos
[8:17] <KodaichiZero> vurtual, wanna play some quake live with me?
[8:17] <Azathoth> honestly i never said anything about it being a good gun
[8:17] <LuciferZ> No, you won't
[8:17] <LuciferZ> You'll look like an idiot
[8:17] <Vicrry> Full-auto shotguns have been done better, by just about everyone else
[8:17] <vurtual> here's the real cool guns
[8:17] <vurtual> guns in ww2
[8:17] <LuciferZ> No one is badass with an assualt rifle
[8:18] <vurtual> those are cool guns
[8:18] <vurtual> civil war era superguns were kinda cool then
[8:18] <Azathoth> and assault rifles are badass
[8:18] <vurtual> modern guns that are useful they are cool
[8:18] <LuciferZ> No
[8:18] <Dommys> Shotgun barrel feeds are just awesome looking
[8:18] <LuciferZ> Not even a little badass
[8:18] <LG_Legacy> So about dem carbines
[8:18] <Azathoth> carbines too
[8:18] * Masa-bed counters with an M82.
[8:18] <LuciferZ> Badassness comes from uniqueness. The gun every infantryman carries is not badass
[8:18] <Azathoth> pfft
[8:18] <Vicrry> 30 M1 Carbine <- T3H W!N! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_carbine
[8:18] <Azathoth> you're one of those people
[8:19] * Masa-bed once again counters with the M82.
[8:19] <Azathoth> where things can only be cool if they're unique :S
[8:19] <LuciferZ> Badass is a gun
[8:19] <LuciferZ> That belongs that you keep in a box
[8:19] <KodaichiZero> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ebtj1jR7c watch this
[8:19] <LuciferZ> On the fireplace
[8:19] <Azathoth> meh
[8:19] <LuciferZ> And when asskicking is needed
[8:19] <vurtual> your average m16 can fire 30 rounds quickly
[8:19] <KodaichiZero> I found this shotgun a year before MW2 came out
[8:19] <vurtual> each ofw hich is capible of killing
[8:19] <LuciferZ> You break it out, perfectly polished, and fuck everyone up
[8:19] <vurtual> at the range of a sniper rifle for a trained marksman
[8:19] <Vicrry> Or maybe a Mk19. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mk_19_grenade_launcher
[8:19] <Azathoth> g36 fires the same rounds, vurtual
[8:20] <vurtual> but it weighs alot
[8:20] <Masa-bed> MK19, you find those on choppers.
[8:20] <vurtual> for no reason
[8:20] <LuciferZ> Yeah, Kodaichi
[8:20] <Azathoth> does it?
[8:20] <vurtual> like, at all
[8:20] <vurtual> I mean, really
[8:20] <LuciferZ> The AA12 has so little recoil
[8:20] <vurtual> you need a thing to throw bullets
[8:20] <Azathoth> i thought it weighed less from being made out of plastic :\
[8:20] <vurtual> not a bad fashion show
[8:20] <vurtual> the m16 is technically "plastic" too
[8:20] <LuciferZ> That they're making UAV helicopters armed with them
[8:20] <Azathoth> bad fashion show!?
[8:20] <vurtual> it's certainly not pure metal
[8:20] <Vicrry> MK19's are everywhere. IFV's, Heli's, Infantry, etc..
[8:20] <KodaichiZero> The AA-12 is definitely the world's best shotgun
[8:20] <Azathoth> g36c is out of a fucking sci fi movie, only in a good way
[8:20] <KodaichiZero> IT CAN FIRE GRENADES
[8:20] <vurtual> aa-12 is lame and you are all trolls
[8:20] <KodaichiZero> 5 PER SECOND
[8:20] <vurtual> anyways I'm gonna play more quake
[8:20] <Azathoth> k
[8:20] <KodaichiZero> vurtual
[8:21] <Azathoth> i might actually go play morrowind

[8:25] <vurtual> pirate them with dollars zero

[8:25] <vurtual> Azathoth webkit
[8:25] <AndrewPH> Azathoth, it doesn't
[8:25] <vurtual> safari
[8:25] <AndrewPH> it uses webkit for everything now
[8:25] <Azathoth> hell yea

[8:25] <AndrewPH> vurtual, not safari
[8:25] <AndrewPH> safari uses webkit
[8:25] <vurtual> IT'S SIMILAR
[8:25] <AndrewPH> crome also uses webkit
[8:25] <vurtual> OK OK OK OK OK STOP HECKLING ME MAN
[8:25] <Azathoth> not sure what the hell webkit is, but it's gotta be better than IE
[8:25] * vurtual knocks out AndrewPH
[8:25] <Masa-bed> Chrome is probably a better choice.
[8:26] <Masa-bed> -much- better than IE at least.

[8:26] <AndrewPH> stop being a retard masa
[8:26] <Masa-bed> I just like Chrome. lol

[8:26] <Masa-bed> Firefox is nice but it's a memory hog for me.

[8:27] <vurtual> masterofmayhem KodaichiZero?

[8:27] <KodaichiZero> yeah
[8:27] <vurtual> have not palyed house of pain yet
[8:27] <vurtual> that I know of
[8:28] <Azathoth> ugh. i hate it when sites ask you to enter your birthday to view them
[8:28] <Azathoth> i wonder if they keep stats... because if they do, they'll see that an extraordinary amount of people have january 1 birthdays
[8:29] <Azathoth> i don't know why they can't just say "are you 18? y/n"
[8:29] <Azathoth> and have the no redirect you to crayola
[8:29] <Masa-bed> because they like to pretend they have power over the younger audience, that's why.
[8:29] <Malikat> i always worried i would get caught
[8:29] <Malikat> because my birthday is 123
[8:30] <Azathoth> it's just as easy to select a year before 1990 or whatever it is now, as it is to click a button that says yes
[8:30] <Malikat> i thought that there would be something ON THE INTERNETTTTT that would assume i was faking
[8:30] <Azathoth> asking you to enter your birthday isn't gonna stop you from lieing about it...
[8:30] <Azathoth> lol
[8:30] <Azathoth> unless you're malikat, apparently
[8:30] <Malikat> >: yeah
[8:31] <Masa-bed> I didn't care either way, lol.
[8:31] <Azathoth> probably some dumb law that CHRISTIAN MOTHERS AGAINST SATANISTIC VIDEO GAMES lobbied for or something
[8:31] <Masa-bed> you're thinking of Rick Thompson, I think.
[8:31] <Azathoth> jack thompson?
[8:31] <Masa-bed> yeah, him.
[8:31] <Masa-bed> always get the first name wrong.
[8:32] <Malikat> jerk thompson
[8:32] <Masa-bed> not that I care, he was a grade a moron.
[8:32] <Azathoth> i haven't really heard from him lately
[8:32] <Azathoth> either he finally gave up or people just stopped caring
[8:32] <Masa-bed> he got disbarred, that's why.
[8:32] <Azathoth> i thought he still could practice in some other state though
[8:32] <Masa-bed> no, his full license was revoked.
[8:32] <rbos> he'd have to pass the bar, and with a disbarment, he'd have trouble getting a license
[8:32] <rbos> is my understanding
[8:33] <Masa-bed> not like any sane person would let him back into the legal arena.
[8:33] <Azathoth> i could have sworn he had a license in another state also
[8:33] <Azathoth> guess i'm wrong
[8:33] <Azathoth> i mean before he got disbarred in florida
[8:34] <Azathoth> either way, he's a dumbass
[8:34] <Masa-bed> that's also where his (last time I checked, only) license was based in.
[8:34] <Masa-bed> get disbarred and you're done.
[8:34] <Masa-bed> but yes, he is.
[8:34] <Masa-bed> *looks at Penny Arcade*
[8:34] <Azathoth> ROFL
[8:34] <Azathoth> By this time, Thompson was looking to have Time Warner, then being criticized for promoting the Ice-T song Cop Killer, prosecuted for federal and state crimes such as sedition, incitement to riot, and "advocating overthrow of government" by distributing material that, in Thompson's view, advocated the killing of police officers.
[8:35] <Masa-bed> where'd you see that? lol
[8:35] <Azathoth> wikipedia
[8:35] <Azathoth> fucking amazing
[8:35] <Masa-bed> go look at his TVTropes entry.
[8:35] <Azathoth> i love simple minded christian people
[8:35] <Azathoth> who only see things in black and white
[8:35] <Masa-bed> he's a terrible example of a christian.
[8:35] <Masa-bed> he's a JerkAss.
[8:36] <Azathoth> i still laugh a little inside every time i think of video games being murder simulators
[8:36] <Azathoth> he's really ballsy in his accusations
[8:36] <Masa-bed> we must be pretty good at murder, then.
[8:36] <Azathoth> he says such stupid shit
[8:37] <Masa-bed> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackThompson Yes, yes he does.
[8:37] <Azathoth> Sony (for simply having the platform on which Grand Theft Auto has been most successful)
[8:37] <Azathoth> god, how is he that dumb?
[8:37] <Azathoth> the sims? wat?
[8:38] <Azathoth> wait

[8:38] <Azathoth> Wendy's (for selling Wii toys consisting of Super Mario, Excite Truck and Wii Sports because it was supporting the system that Manhunt 2 would be on),
[8:38] <Azathoth> fucking seriously?
[8:38] <Azathoth> i don't think anyone is that dumb?
[8:39] <Masa-bed> he is.
[8:39] <Azathoth> why not sue anyone who has ever made a TV or a computer monitor?
[8:39] <Azathoth> because they can be used to view porn
[8:39] <Masa-bed> he's a zealot without his -brain-.
[8:40] <Masa-bed> just read the stuff about his disbarrment.

[8:48] <vurtual> Azathoth I have to be heavily medicated and have to live in solitary confinement because I lost at quake.
[8:48] <vurtual> it's not funny
[8:48] <Azathoth> yes it is
[8:48] <Azathoth> LOL
[8:48] <vurtual> Okay, let's not have the medication-stuff going on
[8:48] <vurtual> I'll end up killing a few people
[8:48] <vurtual> and start mass-fires
[8:48] <vurtual> THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I LET MYSELF FAIL
[8:48] <Azathoth> it's because you train to murder people with your video games
[8:48] <Azathoth> like quake
[8:49] <Azathoth> it's desensitized you to violence
[8:49] <Masa-bed> oh, right.
[8:49] <Azathoth> and taught you how to murder people with such weapons as rocket launchers
[8:49] <Azathoth> and energy weapons
[8:49] <Masa-bed> Thompson wasn't just disbarred, he was permanently disbarred. SoYeah, he is -done- done.
[8:49] <Masa-bed> thank the stars.
[8:49] <vurtual> no, I've lived my WHOLE LIFE with the fact that I can end up in an unhealthy rage just because I got third place

[10:31] <Azathoth> anyway, i'm looking forward to being in debt for the rest of my life. at least i'll have an extensive collection of games to show for it. i just hope steam doesn't go under :\
[10:31] <vurtual> sleeping didn't work
[10:31] <vurtual> Azathoth if you wish to make- no wait wrong quote
[10:31] <mail2345> woa
[10:31] <mail2345> just joined an SS13 game
[10:31] <Azathoth> an apple pie from scratch?
[10:32] <vurtual> Valve says they'd de-steam games if steam went under
[10:32] <mail2345> and someone broke into AI upload
[10:32] <mail2345> with a freeform module
[10:32] <mail2345> now
[10:32] <mail2345> hrm
[10:32] <vurtual> freeform module?
[10:32] <vurtual> ai upload
[10:32] <Azathoth> somehow i doubt they would be able to do that with any non-valve games
[10:32] <mail2345> that means you can change
[10:32] <mail2345> the AI's laws
[10:32] <mail2345> to anything
[10:32] <vurtual> Azathoth it's pretty much in their whole "use steam" thing
[10:32] <vurtual> want your game on steam? Accept to this.
[10:32] <Azathoth> well
[10:32] <Azathoth> fien
[10:33] <vurtual> oh hey 50% off the force unleashed ultimate extra tiny mission edition
[10:33] <yoshibot> If you wish to make an apple pie, you must first invent the universe.
[10:33] <Azathoth> can't you go faster than 1.1 MB/s!?!? fuckign steam is fail
[10:33] <vurtual> dude
[10:33] <Azathoth> an apple pie from scratch*
[10:33] <yoshibot> yes

[10:33] <vurtual> it has to go overnight ok
[10:33] <Azathoth> i don't know how you live with yourself

[10:34] <vurtual> yoshibot one time I made pizza from scratch
[10:34] <mnjiman> force unleashed was the shortest game in the world
[10:34] <Azathoth> if i can't download ANYTHING in under an hour, i get impatient
[10:34] <vurtual> "pepperoni and celery"
[10:34] <yoshibot> vurtual: did you have to invent the universe?
[10:34] <vurtual> no
[10:34] <yoshibot> because if you didn't it's not from scratch
[10:34] <vurtual> just a toilet to handle all the vomit
[10:34] <Azathoth> like that one time i downloaded the human genome project
[10:34] <vurtual> already had a universe invented from earlier
[10:34] <yoshibot> ah
[10:34] <yoshibot> premade.
[10:34] <vurtual> like in shows
[10:34] <mnjiman> ..
[10:34] <yoshibot> still not from scratch
[10:34] <mnjiman> wat?!

[10:36] <vurtual> "Luckily, I prepared one from earlier"
[10:37] <Azathoth> why is the ipad so pointless?

[10:39] <vurtual> or Gordon Sagan
[10:39] <Azathoth> somehow i don't think i'd make a very good astrophysicist
[10:39] <Azathoth> lol
[10:39] <vurtual> Azathoth here's the job pretty much
[10:39] <vurtual> come up with strange sounding ideas.
[10:39] <vurtual> math for years slowly
[10:39] <felixfelicis42> hey does anyone know if a firewall will block access to a server ur running?

[10:41] <sirzo> youre a sick man Serow
[10:41] <Azathoth> you might have to open some ports for it
[10:41] <vurtual> for the sheep?
[10:41] <vurtual> ewww

[10:41] <felixfelicis42> meh

[10:42] <vurtual> Azathoth don't worry

[10:42] <vurtual> singing one tune but then immediately singing another so you don't like, cause a thunderstorm?(song of storms)
[10:42] <Azathoth> oh
[10:43] <Azathoth> you're on crack
[10:43] <Azathoth> go to bed

[10:45] <vurtual> It's just the screw-up dissapointment
[10:45] <vurtual> put yourself against bots
[10:45] <vurtual> practice leading points
[10:45] <vurtual> get used to new arenas and ideas
[10:45] <Azathoth> get leet
[10:45] <vurtual> and even if you're only barely leading a bot by a point, you'll still feel good.
[10:45] <Azathoth> aight. i'm out
[10:45] <Azathoth> cya broskis later
[10:46] <Codlike> Did we determine what kinda of keyboard Notch had?
[10:46] <Azathoth> a white one
[10:46] <Azathoth> did we stalk notch?
[10:48] <Codlike> no, he posted a pic of his four monitors and his desk
[10:48] <Azathoth> i know
[10:48] <Azathoth> does it matter what keyboard he's using though? :P
[10:49] <Azathoth> i wonder if anyone has triangulated his position from that other picture with the radio masts in it
[10:49] <vurtual> Why does every other generation look silly
[10:49] <vurtual> It's not just like the previous one was creepy
[10:49] <vurtual> but then your great grandpa? He probably looked like a stereotypical nerd, and that was normal
[10:49] <Azathoth> generation of what?
[10:49] <Azathoth> oh
[10:49] <vurtual> oh no our kids will be ugly :(
[10:49] <Azathoth> those people things
[10:51] <Yourself> <Azathoth> i wonder if anyone has triangulated his position from that other picture with the radio masts in it
[10:51] <Yourself> yes
[10:51] <vurtual> I can't sleep guys
[10:51] <vurtual> wat do I do
[10:51] <Yourself> not our problem
[10:51] <Codlike> I saw Notch post 'You guys are getting creepy' on his twitter
[10:51] <Codlike> so I assume someone did
[10:52] <vurtual> anyways by using google maps and streetview and some other stuff
[10:52] <vurtual> I figured out where notch goes most of the time
[10:52] <Yourself> he should know better than to post pictures of well-known landmarks
[10:52] <Azathoth> i don't know. i probably wouldn't post something that would let people find almost my exact location on the interwebs like that
[10:52] <Codlike> where he goes?
[10:52] <Azathoth> especially in a community that has so many 4chan people :P
[10:52] <Codlike> like that Max chain where he got his burger
[10:52] <Codlike> ?
[10:52] <vurtual> where he drives
[10:52] <vurtual> what roads
[10:52] <Yourself> if i took a picture out of my window, you'd see corn fields
[10:52] <vurtual> Azathoth mostly /v/
[10:52] <Codlike> he drives?
[10:52] <vurtual> they aren't the worst
[10:52] <vurtual> some fp users though
[10:52] <Azathoth> still 4chan
[10:53] <vurtual> /b/ is the stalkery ones
[10:53] <vurtual> msot effective
[10:53] <Codlike> eugh
[10:53] <vurtual> hm, to stream jc2 or just play it alone
[10:53] <Azathoth> stream
[10:53] <Azathoth> even though i won't watch it because it will slow down my oblivion download
[10:53] <vurtual> to nobody?
[10:53] <Codlike> stream it
[10:53] <Codlike> so I can go to bed
[10:53] <Codlike> wait
[10:53] <Codlike> how about I just go to bed?
[10:53] <Azathoth> with me
[10:54] <Codlike> wake up later on tonight when Notch i-
[10:54] <vurtual> & me
[10:54] <vurtual> threesome
[10:54] <vurtual> <3
[10:54] <Codlike> uh..
[10:54] <Codlike> sure
[10:54] <Codlike> :)
[10:54] <Codlike> I'll cancel waking up later tonight
[10:54] <Azathoth> oh wow
[10:55] <Azathoth> i have a tendency to scribble whatever i'm thinking on whatever paper is in front of me
[10:55] <Codlike> wow ho
[10:55] <Codlike> oh
[10:55] <Azathoth> i ended up drawing some ancient man
[10:55] <Codlike> what did you scribb-
[10:55] <Azathoth> holding a sandal thing
[10:55] <Azathoth> and then i wrote "let me see that thooooooong"
[10:55] <Codlike> um.. interesting
[10:55] <vurtual> ok I'll stream jc2 on low low low
[10:55] <Azathoth> it was all subconscious.
[10:55] <vurtual> even though nobody's watching
[10:55] <Azathoth> my subconscious mind is pretty clever
[10:55] <vurtual> Azathoth I can do you one better

[10:56] <Codlike> if only I could scribble like that
[10:56] <vurtual> I invented a sci-fi game complete with choreography and plot
[10:56] <vurtual> in a minute or so
[10:56] <vurtual> walking outside
[10:56] <Azathoth> i do that all the time -_-
[10:56] <vurtual> the plot is pretty sound and it even has physics engine
[10:56] <vurtual> I wrote out the code that I remembered
[10:56] <Azathoth> lol
[10:56] <vurtual> and it was a working physics engine
[10:56] <Codlike> wow
[10:56] <Azathoth> i just visualize random movie scenes and stuff sometimes
[10:56] <Codlike> anyway
[10:56] <Codlike> I go bed
[10:56] <vurtual> basically if it keeps coming back to me
[10:56] <vurtual> I can just pull a game out of nowhere(OR THE FUTURE)
[10:56] <Azathoth> and make up these conversations in my head. i don't even know the context
[10:56] <vurtual> or maybe I just was remembering what I wrote in the future
[10:56] <vurtual> so I created a loop

[10:57] <Splatticus> Are caves in infdev?
[10:57] <vurtual> no
[10:57] <Codlikeinbeddontopenthedoor> no
[10:57] <Azathoth> holy shit
[10:57] <vurtual> insert vigorously this is a rare opportunity

[10:57] <Codlikeinbed> Better?
[10:57] <Azathoth> that's what she said
[10:58] <Splatticus> Why did I just stumble across a pocket of space under a hill? In which there is growing grass that isn't possibly there due to lack of sunlight? o.o
[10:58] <Codlikeinbed> that's what happens in infdev
[10:58] <Azathoth> i don't think it grows the grass when it generates like the old level generators
[10:58] <Azathoth> if that made sense
[10:58] <Splatticus> ... But there aren't caves.
[10:58] <vurtual> you know what'd be scary
[10:58] <Codlikeinbed> some hills have an explosion of sound under a hill
[10:58] <vurtual> if caves DID form
[10:58] <Splatticus> How did I find a subterranian pocket, aka a cave?
[10:58] <vurtual> due to the generator doing real terrain
[10:59] <Azathoth> because the generator does overhangs and stuff now
[10:59] <Codlikeinbed> therefore, you could technically find a sphere of open space under a hill
[10:59] <Azathoth> but it doesn't do true caves

[11:00] <vurtual> I use my teeth
[11:00] <Othilious> Do the yellow faction missions until you get to "fry me to the moon". Best mission ever.
[11:00] <vurtual> see, teeth driving: http://www.livestream.com/vurtual
[11:00] <vurtual> did fry me to the moon
[11:00] <vurtual> beat thew hole game except some missions

[11:00] <vurtual> and lots of random completino

[11:02] <Codlikeinbed> or I got the blue one wrong
[11:02] <Codlikeinbed> I dont know who they are
[11:03] <Azathoth> i think this yellow faction thing is a reference to red faction
[11:03] <Azathoth> run into a street lamp, motherfucker
[11:03] <Azathoth> ew
[11:03] <Azathoth> what's with the yellow guide arrows
[11:04] <Azathoth> is there an option to turn them off? it ruins the beautifulness of the game
[11:04] <Codlikeinbed> they're usually not there
[11:04] <Codlikeinbed> he must've set a waypoint
[11:05] <Azathoth> i used to love just cause... just cause it was a really pretty looking game
[11:05] <Codlikeinbed> mm
[11:05] <Codlikeinbed> the water in particular
[11:05] <Azathoth> yea
[11:05] <Codlikeinbed> and the stuff
[11:05] <Azathoth> i liked the clouds too
[11:05] <Codlikeinbed> JC was a good game for that
[11:05] <Codlikeinbed> This one lives up to it pretty well I think
[11:06] <Codlikeinbed> although, I miss letting the cars pull me along

[11:06] <Codlikeinbed> eeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[11:06] <Azathoth> does the character in this one not have bad hair at least?
[11:06] <Codlikeinbed> eeeep
[11:06] <Azathoth> he had a mullet in JC. it was awful
[11:06] <Codlikeinbed> hair is uh..
[11:07] <Azathoth> is that snow?
[11:07] <Codlikeinbed> http://xbox360media.ign.com/xbox360/image/article/848/848248/just-cause-2-20080129091532298_640w.jpg
[11:07] <Codlikeinbed> yep
[11:07] <Codlikeinbed> snow
[11:07] <Codlikeinbed> sleep now
[11:07] <Codlikeinbed> gnight
[11:07] <Azathoth> well i guess he looks a little better
[11:07] <Codlikeinbed> (you can get skins for him if you dont like it)
[11:07] <Othilious> Theres all types of terrain and weather in JC2. Snow, desert, forest and swamp. Snowstorms and rain and thunderstorms. Nightly thunderstorms look amazing.
[11:08] <Azathoth> neat
[11:08] <Azathoth> is it still on an island?
[11:08] <Othilious> Yup
[11:08] <Othilious> Several now
[11:08] <Azathoth> i don't know of many tropical islands with snow... but that's cool i guess
[11:08] <mail2345> snow
[11:08] <Othilious> Its in the mountains
[11:08] <mail2345> is in hawaii
[11:08] <mail2345> in the volcano tops
[11:08] <Azathoth> NOPE
[11:09] <Azathoth> is the world bigger in this one?
[11:09] <Othilious> Yes
[11:09] <Othilious> Massively bigger
[11:09] <Azathoth> :D
[11:09] <Azathoth> it was already freakin massive before
[11:10] <Othilious> Though they did get a bit sloppy with some the the terrain. There are a couple of areas that have roads end in the middle of nowhere, or a cliff thats a bid oddly-angled. Theres even a bit in the southeast area where all the traffic ramps off a small cliff onto the next bit of road XD
[11:10] <Azathoth> lol
[11:10] <Azathoth> they probably procedurally generate a lot of it
[11:11] <Othilious> If you??e gonna get the game, get it for PC. Mods a plenty, better graphics and a trainer that makes the grapple unbreakable and allows you to attach as many as you want
[11:11] <Azathoth> well... grenades are still ridiculous
[11:12] <Othilious> Hooking a boeing to a tree and seeing it fly in circles around it is hilarious
[11:12] <Azathoth> lol
[11:12] <Azathoth> sounds realistic

[11:44] <Splatticus> Ooh.
[11:44] <Splatticus> Another idea.
[11:45] <Splatticus> Make a square of stone, and put an item inside, such as a porkchop, and it will create a block with the item's image on it. Sort of a way to label doors.
[11:45] <Codlikeinbed> ok

[11:46] <Viral> Splatticus: How would you organise those bricks in your inventory.
[11:46] <Codlike> Also, does anyone know what Notch was on about when he said he'd put in a grey block that uses alot of resources?
[11:46] <Splatticus> It's not exactly something you'd stack. o.O You'd make one and be done.
[11:46] <Splatticus> ...

[11:54] <vurtual> what if the blocks had to set in the sun
[11:54] <vurtual> time being lit or just placed maybe results in them hardening, but before that, anyone can dig them quickly.
[11:55] <Splatticus> Hmmm.
[11:55] <Othilious> That's a pretty good idea actually... Makes fixing mistakes a lot less timeconsuming...
[11:56] <Splatticus> Sorry Codlike, if I seemed condescending. :) It's just I'm very energetic about texture modification, because I'm learning all about it today and practicing it.
[11:56] <Splatticus> Tomorrow I'm going to do my spider mod.
[11:56] <Othilious> What are you modding about them?
[11:56] <Codlike> ah, ok
[11:56] <Splatticus> I think once I complete pig, I might zip it and upload and share.

[11:58] <Codlike> dont think you can change the models
[11:58] <Codlike> so you'll have to just do them as textures
[11:58] <Splatticus> My sheeps are black-sheeps, now.
[11:58] <Splatticus> And yeah, Cod, I know. :]
[11:58] <Splatticus> I'm probably just going to use an ivory tone and wrap it around the side of the head.
[11:59] <Othilious> It'd be cool if you could reference different texture files for mobs from an XML and have a spawned mob randomly choose one...
[11:59] <Othilious> That way you just add a new texture, and add variety.
[11:59] <Splatticus> That might be a way of doing NPC humans. It'd randomize them.
[11:59] <Othilious> Yeah, XML set up like <human>
[11:59] <Splatticus> Think it out and suggest it, Othilious. :x
[12:00] <Othilious> Hmmm, might actually...
[12:00] <Splatticus> Right now my pigs are only modded with red eyes and black, angry eyebrows.
[12:00] <Splatticus> You get a jumping mass of them and it's actually moderately intimidating.

[13:20] <Notch> not sure
[13:21] <LG_Legacy> Hey notch any ideas on to fix people imitatign servers? :D
[13:21] <Foshie> Oh, Crouching will be added? :P
[13:21] <Codlike> wouldn't it most likely be 1 block though?
[13:21] <Codlike> since the player is two high?
[13:21] <Tommerry11> yea, just wondering.
[13:22] <Codlike> I've assumed and have kept that vision in my head since I heard about crouching

[13:29] <Codlike> Hello Nesral
[13:29] <Sleech> Hello
[13:30] <Codlike> Oh, Notch, may I request one small change with minecraft on a technical standing?
[13:31] <Speljohan_> sup Seepia
[13:31] <Codlike> That when playing in the browser you dedicate about 350mb of ram?
[13:31] <Codlike> or would that be a little too much?
[13:31] <Superwafflez> That's quite a lot...
[13:31] <Superwafflez> Some people still run 512mb
[13:32] <Codlike> true, it is

[13:32] * Gibri (eia234@tgad43.rhi.hi.is) has joined #minecraft
[13:32] <Speljohan_> my dad has 512mb Superwafflez
[13:32] <Speljohan_> but
[13:32] <Speljohan_> his computer is 9 years old
[13:32] <Codlike> but those running that much would also have a significantly performance
[13:32] <Speljohan_> so it was pretty hi-tech back then
[13:32] <Codlike> significantly LOW performance
[13:32] <Superwafflez> I don't think notch wants to exclude any potential customers...
[13:32] <Notch> why make it allocate mor pram?
[13:33] <Notch> *more ram
[13:33] <Codlike> I think I noticed there was alot of Ram usage during one stage of Infdev
[13:33] <Speljohan_> lol, i usually have java allocate 2gb ram for the vm Notch
[13:33] <Codlike> and a fair amount during Indev at one point
[13:33] <Codlike> then again
[13:33] <Codlike> Large servers
[13:33] <Notch> yes, but if it never runs out of ram, what does it matter what the heap size is?
[13:33] <Foshie> You get better performance with higher mem allocation in java?
[13:33] <Notch> yes, for SERVERS, sure
[13:34] <Siiseli> I had a java exam today
[13:34] <Speljohan_> depends Foshie
[13:34] <Siiseli> it took me 4 hours
[13:34] <Foshie> Speljohan_, Okey
[13:34] <Speljohan_> depends on application design/efficiency
[13:34] <Siiseli> I fucking hate gui coding
[13:34] <Siiseli> it sucks
[13:34] <Siiseli> horriblyt'
[13:34] <Siiseli> horribly*
[13:34] <Rithiur> I hate coding with pencil and paper.
[13:34] <Speljohan_> Siiseli making a gui programmatically sucks
[13:34] <Speljohan_> and is a waste of time
[13:34] <Speljohan_> :P
[13:34] <Codlike> is it possible to OPTIONALLY allocate more ram?
[13:34] <Codlike> add an option
[13:34] <Speljohan_> yeh Codlike
[13:34] <Siiseli> Speljohan_, sure but we have to for this course. :)
[13:34] <Siiseli> super fun
[13:34] <Speljohan_> sucks

[13:44] <Speljohan_> ye, this pc has a max uptime of about 2 months
[13:44] <Speljohan_> that was when i ran vista tho
[13:44] <Speljohan_> win7 forces me to restart at least once a week
[13:44] <Foshie> or rather, all my computers are up 24/7..
[13:44] <Afk_Legacy> Gay
[13:45] <Afk_Legacy> This is why i use XP it doesn't do anything unless i tell it to :>
[13:45] <PyroWorks> anyone know how to get notebook skins in EU?
[13:45] <PyroWorks> custom ones?
[13:45] <Speljohan_> i would use xp if it had better memory allocation Afk_Legacy
[13:45] <PyroWorks> i want a pink/purple one... but cant find non...
[13:45] <Afk_Legacy> Then use better memory allocation
[13:45] <Speljohan_> xp cannot provide that
[13:45] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:46] <Foshie> I avoid XP .. just this 141 day machine that is running XP ..
[13:46] <Rithiur> I wish I could continue using XP, but have to upgrade to win7 to get8 8gb of memory.
[13:46] <Speljohan_> i am downgrading to vista shortly
[13:46] <Afk_Legacy> I only have 2 gb ram
[13:46] <Afk_Legacy> I need to install another stick :<
[13:46] <Speljohan_> win7 has given me too many (un)expected surprises
[13:47] <Speljohan_> as i foresaw
[13:47] <Foshie> and i am running Windows 7 on all machines except the netbook which i run Ubuntu on but it sucks..

[13:48] <Afk_Legacy> I would lose alot of programs too
[13:48] <Speljohan_> :P
[13:48] <Rithiur> I'd probably switch to ubuntu or some other linux distro if I didn't play so many games.
[13:48] <Foshie> Eat memory? ... Windows 7 is using less memory then Vista / XP
[13:48] <Speljohan_> i wouldn't recommend any windows version post xp without having at least 4gb ram
[13:48] <Afk_Legacy> Lol?
[13:48] <Speljohan_> bullshit Foshie
[13:48] <Speljohan_> xp uses less memory
[13:48] <Afk_Legacy> That
[13:48] <Speljohan_> it has been proven a multitude of time
[13:48] <Speljohan_> s
[13:48] <Afk_Legacy> 2k Uses even less
[13:49] <Speljohan_> despite microsoft's propaganda
[13:49] <Afk_Legacy> Notch, rain in minecraft. Thoughts? And thoughts on the bug with F5 and rain on infdev?
[13:50] <Speljohan_> anyways, i would never recommend ubuntu Rithiur
[13:50] <Speljohan_> it's the windows of linux distros
[13:50] <Chocolatey_Syrup> That's not a bug
[13:50] <Chocolatey_Syrup> how is that a bug
[13:50] <Afk_Legacy> It doesn't fully show rain
[13:50] <Speljohan_> bloated, slow and full of half-finished applications

[13:51] <Rithiur> Speljohan_: I don't really have that much experience with different distros, I it's s omething I would get started with and probably change to something else once I'd pissed off aboutit.
[13:51] <Afk_Legacy> If you're really seeking a fast and painless/small installation of a OS and just want to do something simple, install the 10mb distro :D
[13:51] <Foshie> Oh well, Windows 7 kicks XP's as anyways.. In performance and everything else.. XP's memorymanagement stinks
[13:51] <Speljohan_> i see Rithiur :P
[13:51] <PyroWorks> so...
[13:51] <PyroWorks> skins? meow :D
[13:51] <Speljohan_> yes, xp's memory management sucks Foshie
[13:51] <Speljohan_> IF
[13:51] <Speljohan_> you have > 2gb ram
[13:51] <Speljohan_> otherwise it's fine
[13:51] <Afk_Legacy> I have exactly 2 gb :D
[13:52] <Speljohan_> i'm on 8gb
[13:52] <Codlike> I had three at one point
[13:52] <Speljohan_> that was my reason for upgrading
[13:52] <Codlike> with my xp
[13:52] <Afk_Legacy> http://www.tinycorelinux.com/ For any of you linux whores.
[13:52] <Codlike> now I have 4 with W7
[13:52] <Speljohan_> too small Afk_Legacy
[13:52] <Speljohan_> !
[13:52] <Speljohan_> arch is optimal
[13:52] <Afk_Legacy> :P
[13:52] <Foshie> i have on my current machine 8, but the new machine i am getting has 12 gb ..

[13:52] <Rithiur> The only thing XP is good for these days is the fact that it tends to be most compatible with different software. At least that's the reason I've used it so far.
[13:53] <Speljohan_> yeah Rithiur
[13:53] <Afk_Legacy> Thats why i use it now, and cause it's so simple.
[13:53] <Afk_Legacy> Seriously Foshie Are you rich AND a dick or what?
[13:53] <Speljohan_> vista/win7 still have shitty backwards compatbility
[13:53] <PyroWorks> go MicroXP :P~
[13:53] <Afk_Legacy> Anyways
[13:53] <ylt> i havnt found much software win7 doesnt work with
[13:53] <Speljohan_> it's so funny
[13:53] <Speljohan_> microsoft said "WIN7 WILL BE BETTER"
[13:53] <Afk_Legacy> Win 7.. Meh, the only reason i dislike it is due to some things not working correctly with it.
[13:53] <Speljohan_> i had more luck running certain apps in vista
[13:53] <Speljohan_> than i did in win7
[13:53] <Afk_Legacy> And also things get confusing if you don't know what you're doing
[13:54] <Foshie> Afk_Legacy, Why do i have to be a dick and rich..? .. Memory doesn't cost a lot and why a dick? ..
[13:54] <Afk_Legacy> Bah don't mind me
[13:54] <Speljohan_> mem is cheap as hell
[13:54] <Afk_Legacy> I'm suppose to be sleeping
[13:54] <Speljohan_> i bought 8gb 1066mhz ram for $160 iirc
[13:54] <Speljohan_> like a year ago
[13:54] <Speljohan_> tho my mobo supports 16gb ram
[13:55] <Speljohan_> but then i need 4gb modules
[13:55] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:55] <Rithiur> 4gb ones are still a bit too expensive for my taste (And hard to get too)
[13:56] <Speljohan_> yeah
[13:56] <Speljohan_> i'd give it a year or two
[13:56] <Speljohan_> then they are common
[13:56] <Rithiur> Though, I don't really think I will be needing more than 8gb of memory for a while.
[13:57] <Rithiur> Just a shame to buy 4x2, when you know you can't add more later :P

[15:10] <ylt> well, i suppose xml is good for trying out an idea... since its easier to type

[15:16] <ylt> well, something to convert the format might be nice xD
[15:18] <Othilious> Still, the general idea is sound right? Imagine being able to download a .zip or .gz and plop that in your minecraft folder and *poof* new content.

[16:31] <Merciless> awesome
[16:31] <Merciless> so glad thats fixed
[16:31] <Codlike> Jolly good news there Merci
[16:31] <Roadcrosser> so notch when do you think ropes the rope despenser will be implemented
[16:31] <Roadcrosser> if it is ever gonna be
[16:31] <Notch> i don't think it will be
[16:31] <Roadcrosser> :(
[16:32] <Merciless> i'm having enough time worrying about creepers spawning under dense trees now
[16:32] <Roadcrosser> why nooooot
[16:32] <Merciless> fuck
[16:32] <Merciless> xD
[16:32] <Seiseki__> I think rope at least should be considered
[16:32] <Viral> Malikat: Mind if I stream for a bit to warm the viewers up for you? :P
[16:32] <Roadcrosser> we need a way to move vertically
[16:32] <Merciless> :O SAND!!!
[16:32] <ZomBuster> instead of ropes have elevators
[16:32] <Viral> or if you're doing it i'll go some other time
[16:32] <Roadcrosser> nuu

[16:33] <Seiseki__> a mining game needs rope and ladders :D
[16:33] <Foshie> i want a cattle prod to push the mobs around XD
[16:33] <Roadcrosser> hmm
[16:33] <ZomBuster> would be cool to go slowly down a mineshaft while torches flash past you
[16:33] <Ausfriend> a mining game needs mining carts
[16:33] <Malikat> i prefer to jump quickly down
[16:33] <Malikat> with torches flashing by
[16:33] <Roadcrosser> a box with 9 strings inside it and a cog and crank at the side
[16:33] <Malikat> until you hit the lava
[16:33] <Seiseki__> Ausfriend, that too :P
[16:34] <Codlike> How about that 'new blcok' you mentioned Notch?
[16:34] <Ausfriend> branch?
[16:34] <Seiseki__> mining carts, winches, rope, ladders, that's all you need for a real mine!
[16:34] <Codlike> um..
[16:34] <Ausfriend> my dwarf fortress mine always has atleast 1 pump
[16:34] <Codlike> "New BLOCK"
[16:34] <Peerko> and canaries
[16:34] <Peerko> you need them in a mine
[16:34] <Seiseki__> what is this new block?
[16:34] <Codlike> the Masonry block
[16:35] <Roadcrosser> so the dispenser detects the nearest block that isnt air or liquid and if it isnt more than 30 blocks down it lets the rope down to it
[16:35] <Codlike> aka
[16:35] <Codlike> Grey Brick, I think
[16:35] <Seiseki__> sweet
[16:35] <Roadcrosser> if it is it just lets down a 30 block long rope
[16:35] <Seiseki__> I saw that suggestion, it's a good idea
[16:35] <Codlike> Who's idea was it again?
[16:35] <Roadcrosser> whatdya think notch?
[16:35] <Peerko> but will that be a new block or just replace the red brick?
[16:35] <Codlike> probably not
[16:36] <Malikat> it will be a new superblock from what i've heard
[16:36] <Peerko> which?
[16:36] <Peerko> ah
[16:36] <Ausfriend> i have an awesome idea for the LUA APIs
[16:36] <Ausfriend> and i think it should be possible
[16:36] <Ausfriend> and i'll be able to code it
[16:36] <luingar> back online
[16:36] <Codlike> Red Brick will probably be a dye'd "grey Brick'
[16:36] <Peerko> ohi luingar

[16:56] <Viral> Malikat: Got a link?
[16:56] <Superwafflez> original spawn would be kinda cool
[16:56] <Superwafflez> a town would appear there

[17:14] <Seiseki__> probably
[17:14] <Drewseph> actually I think all enhemies when outside during the night should hide in forests during the day

[21:55] * Dandistine (biocon8600@136.176.103.142) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[21:56] <Yourself> notch should put in a button that punches people in the face
[21:57] <zeroZshadow> you know.. if for everyone who made the update request.. he puts in a fake dead pixel ingame
[21:57] <zeroZshadow> they will stop really fast
[21:58] <KodaichiZero> notch should add a fast weak weapon that has little knockback and a slow strong weapon that has lots of knockback

[22:02] <Kald> So I just started a massive forestfire on infdev.
[22:02] <Kald> Nothing quite so beautiful as a million little orange flames in the dark~
[22:02] <Kald> Also burning sheep.
[22:02] <Koko|Oyasumi> haha
[22:03] <Koko|Oyasumi> those poor sheep
[22:03] <Koko|Oyasumi> I've actually seen sheep spawn on top of trees
[22:03] <Koko|Oyasumi> so they don't stand even a little chance
[22:03] <Koko|Oyasumi> but yeah, forest fires. rock on <3
[22:03] <Koko|Oyasumi> question
[22:03] <Kald> Go ahead
[22:03] <Koko|Oyasumi> do you think the fire spreads to trees that don't even exist yet o.o

[22:09] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> oh
[22:09] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> is for indev

[22:10] <MeganC> When I try to play infdev, it works up until the point where I would actually get to play. As in, I select level, level 'loads', ..then..nothing, black screen for eternity in the space where fun should exist. :/ I've tried several browsers but, to no avail :[ . help?
[22:11] <Marach> MeganC: wait? i can take some minutes
[22:11] <Kald> Well, I managed to burn my own treehouse down.
[22:11] <Kald> I'm a doofus.
[22:11] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> omen cant open infdev
[22:12] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> infdev world is divided into diferent files
[22:12] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> and format is unsupported
[22:12] <Marach> it's still nbt
[22:12] <slowriot> omen is ancient and outdated crap now, sadly
[22:12] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> i tryed all
[22:12] <slowriot> if you want to edit save files, just whip out your hex editor
[22:12] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> ye
[22:12] <slowriot> his format is fully documented
[22:12] <Marach> and the folder format is crappy and will be changed. (right, Notch?)
[22:12] <slowriot> the save files are just gzipped
[22:12] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> but omen 7 can open nbt
[22:13] <vede-learns> And it's a really simple format too.
[22:13] <MeganC> But it does this with indev occasionally too..
[22:13] <Speljohan_> or you do what should have been done long ago
[22:13] <Speljohan_> just make a 3d editor
[22:13] <slowriot> try HXD as an editor
[22:13] <slowriot> it's a nice, fast, ex editor with good search facilities
[22:13] <slowriot> *hex
[22:13] <slowriot> not an ex editor
[22:13] <MeganC> Usually just reopening the browser solves it for indev though, but never with infdev :[
[22:14] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> thx for program
[22:14] <Cubex|Happy_with_python> it looks interesting
[22:14] <Marach> lmao, ex editor
[22:14] <Speljohan_> srsly tho
[22:14] <Speljohan_> making an editor isnt hard
[22:14] <Speljohan_> surprised nobody else has made one
[22:14] * Cue (cueball61@cpc2-alde4-2-0-cust462.6-2.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[22:14] <Marach> Speljohan_: then make one :D
[22:14] <Kokopure> oh oh!
[22:14] <Kokopure> idea!
[22:14] <Kokopure> well
[22:14] <Speljohan_> already got too many projects on my hands Marach
[22:14] <Kokopure> stealing someone else's idea.
[22:14] <Speljohan_> lo,l
[22:15] <Marach> you have some experience in rendering cubes
[22:15] <Marach> :P
[22:15] <Kokopure> who here had the idea of some sort of detector for ores >_>
[22:15] <Kokopure> someone else had that idea.
[22:15] <slowriot> Speljohan_: i did have an online inventory editor for the previous indev going
[22:15] <slowriot> but tbh, notch changes everything so regularly, it's a full-time job reverse engineering every update he makes
[22:15] <Speljohan_> mk slowriot
[22:15] <slowriot> hardly seems worth the bother
[22:15] <Kokopure> I don't know if they had an idea beyond any sort of item besides just a sort of "you should be able to find ores underground"
[22:15] <Kokopure> but I was thinking, you could be able to craft a dowsing rod?
[22:16] <Speljohan_> reverse engineering formats isnt hard though slowriot
[22:16] * revenant (dlukes@66.37.59.138.nauticom.net) Quit (Quit: revenant)
[22:16] <slowriot> i'd be up for a dowsing rod, that's a nice idea
[22:16] <Speljohan_> because you reverse the software
[22:16] <Kokopure> two vertical rows of iron separated by one empty row, whattaya think?
[22:16] <Speljohan_> not the files
[22:16] <Speljohan_> :P
[22:16] <Speljohan_> just find the output stream writing the files
[22:16] <slowriot> Speljohan_: that's not my point, my point is simply that he keeps adding blocks or changing bits etc
[22:16] <slowriot> it's just a matter of the workload of updating your editor to keep track of every new change he makes in block behaviour etc
[22:16] <Speljohan_> you could always write an app that grabs the data automatically slowriot :P
[22:16] <slowriot> and as i say, there's not enough demand for it for anyoen to be arsed
[22:16] * Rooster (chatzilla@pool-74-111-197-38.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[22:16] <Speljohan_> see it as a challenge
[22:17] <slowriot> what, a reverse-engineering robot intelligent enough to figure out blocks from program function?
[22:17] <Speljohan_> easy slowriot
[22:17] <slowriot> that would be some HAL9000 level AI right there
[22:17] <Speljohan_> not really
[22:17] <slowriot> well go write one and come back with it
[22:17] <Rooster> hey guys, do trees grow in infdev right now?
[22:17] <slowriot> i'd love to see it
[22:17] <Foshie> Rooster, Yes
[22:17] <Speljohan_> slowriot, simply use a bytecode library
[22:17] <slowriot> Rooster: yeah, a bit too much
[22:17] <Rooster> I mean, with saplings
[22:17] <Speljohan_> find a pattern to getting the method outputting file
[22:17] <slowriot> Speljohan_: that doesn't include a mindreading ability, last time i checked
[22:17] <Speljohan_> you don't need to slowriot
[22:17] <Kald> I can see my house from here.
[22:17] <Kokopure> although, I wonder
[22:17] <Kald> I can see it burning.
[22:17] <Kokopure> if you do have a dowsing rod, that might make it too easy to mine
[22:18] <Rooster> Foshie ,I mean with saplings when you plant them
[22:18] <Kokopure> so maybe there should be some sort of "junk ore" that the dowsing rod is also attracted to >_>?
[22:18] * Kokopure ponders
[22:18] <Foshie> Rooster, It has done that for me.. grown that is
[22:18] <slowriot> what, like gold? =)
[22:18] <Kokopure> haha
[22:18] <Kokopure> XD
[22:18] <Foshie> Rooster, Took a few "ingame" days what i seen
[22:18] <Kokopure> basically wood that grows underground, Gold is
[22:18] <slowriot> no wai, wood is actually useful
[22:18] <Speljohan_> simply have the app reverse engineer the method outputting the map file format slowriot, then make it save the format based of those values
[22:18] <Rooster> Are you talking about new infdev trees?
[22:18] <slowriot> you can at least burn wood =)
[22:18] <Speljohan_> :P

[23:08] <Brett> i get it... it's a troll
[23:08] <Brett> serp, like derp
[23:08] <Speljohan_> i never use physics
[23:08] <bildramer> serp, hm
[23:09] <Speljohan_> in fact, i dont do graphical programming often
[23:09] <bildramer> combine gfx and physics
[23:09] <bildramer> what
[23:09] <serp> in a game engine
[23:09] <Dysgalt> Owat why is it the day
[23:09] <Dysgalt> Im looking
[23:09] <Dysgalt> at like 10 spiders
[23:09] <Speljohan_> i have yet to write a game with physics lol
[23:09] <Dysgalt> :l
[23:09] <Speljohan_> unless you count a constant gravity as physicsw
[23:09] <Speljohan_> loll
[23:09] <bildramer> serp: erm...
[23:09] <serp> Speljohan_: how can you fap to game engine designs if you havent installed graphics
[23:09] <bildramer> what kind of physics?
[23:09] <Brett> do your physics computations with your game logic... your rendering logic draws the result with optional interpolation depending on the frequency of your game logic thread
[23:09] <bildramer> uh
[23:09] <Speljohan_> looking at the code obviously serp !
[23:09] <Brett> since typically your rendering logic thread is mostly unhinged
[23:09] <serp> Brett: rigid body dynamics for starters!
[23:10] <serp> bildramer: !!
[23:10] <Speljohan_> well designed frameworks and implementations <3
[23:10] <bildramer> serp, can you code me a text adventure?
[23:10] <serp> bildramer: I can do plenty more than that!

[23:11] <bildramer> wtf HTML
[23:11] <Brett> web design isn't programming

[23:12] <Brett> why wouldn't it be?
[23:12] <bildramer> like that everything should be correctly capitalized, no spelling mistakes, tags must be closed etc.

[23:16] <vurtual> you had to find a cat.

[23:16] <Brett> had it for a while mang
[23:16] <vurtual> chibifs
[23:16] <serp> I once programmed tetris in xml
[23:16] <vurtual> it's not "minecraft gold"

[23:16] <vurtual> it had ASCII screens that popped up at certain points(an intro sign, a cat if you won).

[23:18] <vurtual> also already did bro
[23:18] <chibifs> my minecraft partition is bigger than my 486's hard drive.
[23:18] <bildramer> you wouldn't want to see my code
[23:19] <Brett> lmao
[23:19] <vurtual> bildramer, in some languages and cases, -0 is valid.
[23:19] <bildramer> yep
[23:19] <serp> most languages
[23:19] <bildramer> but I never wanted that
[23:19] <vurtual> Also clarifying that a value is meant to be negative in normal cases
[23:19] <bildramer> hm
[23:19] <vurtual> also for telling people you are now going into space
[23:19] <bildramer> somewhere I forgot an int where a double should be

[23:20] <Brett> decidedly!

[23:20] <serp> vurtual: are you a good computer programmer?
[23:20] <vurtual> "good" is subjective
[23:20] <bildramer> woot
[23:20] <bildramer> perfectly smooth
[23:20] <vurtual> I've come up with code in my head quickly
[23:20] <vurtual> I just have a poor level of language-specific knowledge
[23:21] <serp> what language is the code in your head?
[23:21] <vurtual> whatever I'd need it in
[23:21] <vurtual> python, C++
[23:21] <vurtual> once or twice lua

[23:21] <Speljohan_> MALIKAT MALIKAT MALIKAT
[23:21] <bildramer> I'm too used to bad C++
[23:21] <vede-learns> I wanna make a language spec called pseudocode.
[23:21] <bildramer> lol
[23:21] <serp> that's stupid
[23:21] <vurtual> the languages I do already know mostly fully are too simple to actually have any advanced use.
[23:21] <vurtual> *coughE2cough*
[23:21] <bildramer> so
[23:22] <Brett> Turing?
[23:22] <vede-learns> So all those Wikipedia articles that have pseudocode to illustrate basic concepts would have to either use my language or come up with a new word.
[23:22] <bildramer> should I do a 3D shooter?
[23:22] <vurtual> *coughnotgmlthatlanguagewascoolcough*
[23:22] <vurtual> Seriously I wonder if
[23:22] <bildramer> or try a platformer?
[23:22] <vurtual> you could make some really useful program in game maker
[23:22] <bildramer> shmup perhaps?
[23:22] <vurtual> then see if anyone notices
[23:22] <VirtualFox> start simple first
