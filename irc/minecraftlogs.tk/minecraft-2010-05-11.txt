[0:00] <Animator> Just ask Notch.
[0:00] <PuyoDead> Or make apps for App Store/Android Market.
[0:00] <Animator> Or Farbs.
[0:00] <Animator> Or Konjak.
[0:00] <Yourself> http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/03/20/mf.rich.off.video.games/index.html
[0:00] <Animator> Or cactus and any other indie dev out there.
[0:01] <Yourself> i know cactus
[0:01] <Yourself> or knew would be the proper term
[0:01] <Animator> It doesn't even have to be something big. Just look at VVVVVVV.
[0:01] <bildramer> lol VVVVVVV
[0:01] <Cat> Whats up with wiki?
[0:01] <Cat> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Special:RecentChanges
[0:01] <Yourself> haven't really spoken to him much since he made it "big" in indie gaming
[0:02] <exe> someone deletes everything
[0:02] <Animator> Cool concept, simple platformer, woth $20. People bought it, and he made money.
[0:02] <Cat> why is Quatroking deleting evrything?
[0:02] <Yourself> actually i haven't spoken much to any of the indie guys i used to know
[0:02] <Quatroking> I'm not deleting everything.
[0:02] <Animator> *worth
[0:02] <bildramer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_1b5uK9Xoc
[0:02] <Quatroking> I deleted a few lonely pages.
[0:02] <bildramer> still fucking hilarious
[0:02] * Demki (Mibbit@93-172-180-117.bb.netvision.net.il) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[0:03] <Animator> But yeah, blaster. How much do you know on programming?
[0:03] * Eythor (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:03] * lefishy (lefishy@cpc3-newt29-2-0-cust66.newt.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:03] * TerraSleet (SikGamer@5ac85129.bb.sky.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:04] <Animator> Judging blaster's silence, I'm keen to guess "Not much to help me make such a thing."
[0:04] <Yourself> never too late or too early to learn
[0:04] <Animator> I'm also going to guess, "I'm not good with graphics, either."
[0:04] <Yourself> there are ways around that
[0:04] <Dysgalt> Has anyone else round here been exploring the http://meningray.net site?
[0:04] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[0:04] <Ten_Tacles> The what?
[0:04] <Animator> Hm, no. *looks*
[0:05] <blaster> How much would you pay for a cubic foot of lego?
[0:05] <Dysgalt> You'll need this Login stuff is: User: officer156 Pass: cRyhfsEwr5332Fxx
[0:05] <blaster> Dysgalt website fails to load
[0:05] <Animator> What blaster said.
[0:05] <bildramer> same
[0:05] <Animator> Ditto.
[0:05] <Dysgalt> :/
[0:06] <blaster> Either a server so shit it can only handle 1 thing at once, or it does not exist
[0:06] <Ten_Tacles> Hm
[0:06] <Dysgalt> http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=936388 well... all those people seem to think it does :)
[0:06] <Animator> But blaster, you didn't answer my question.
[0:06] <blaster> Once again, how much would you pay for a cubic foot of lego?
[0:06] <Yourself> nothing
[0:06] <blaster> And no I dont think I could be an indie dev
[0:06] <Yourself> i don't want a cubic foot of lego
[0:06] <blaster> If you did want a cubic foot of lego
[0:06] <Yourself> i don't
[0:06] * Randati (nnscript@a88-112-207-124.elisa-laajakaista.fi) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:06] <Dysgalt> blaster i have 24 cubic feet of lego in my room
[0:07] <Ten_Tacles> What should I do.
[0:07] <Dysgalt> or something like that
[0:07] <blaster> I have about 4 cubic feet
[0:07] <Quatroking> I have cube feet
[0:07] <Quatroking> D:
[0:07] <Ten_Tacles> I have a plant in my room
[0:07] <bildramer> lolol
[0:07] <blaster> Guys you know that thing where you can get money by viewing ads, does any of that shit work?
[0:08] <Ten_Tacles> It may does.
[0:08] <Animator> You could gain money by answering surveys.
[0:08] <Ten_Tacles> It may or may not work.
[0:08] <Animator> It's free to sign up.
[0:08] <Yourself> yeah, if you're popular enough to have enough unique people looking at those ads
[0:08] <Animator> My Dad used to do them.
[0:08] <blaster> Is it efficient enough to be faster than looking under vending machines?
[0:08] <Yourself> no
[0:08] * Keiya (kyevan@rrcs-70-63-156-144.midsouth.biz.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:09] <Yourself> you have to get a metric fuckton of visitors to really make ads profitable
[0:09] <blaster> Ok, I will search under the vending machines after school every day
[0:09] <Animator> Oh... okay. This is odd.
[0:09] <Yourself> you could sell drugs
[0:09] <blaster> Possibly getting me ?2-3 a day
[0:09] <Yourself> or rob people
[0:09] <blaster> Yourself No
[0:09] <blaster> NONONO
[0:10] <Animator> Uhhhh. Dysgalt...
[0:10] <Animator> What is this...
[0:10] <blaster> I could sell candy, some people in school have earnt ?400 from that
[0:10] <Yourself> why are you so depsarate for money?
[0:10] <blaster> Because there is no other ways to get money
[0:10] <blaster> And I need a new pc
[0:10] <blaster> And my parents have a phobia of technology
[0:10] <Azathoth> blaster, you could try the amazon turk thing
[0:11] <Azathoth> but the payoff for that is also disgustingly low
[0:11] <blaster> About how much an hour
[0:11] <Yourself> it's too bad newegg only shis to the US and canada
[0:12] <Yourself> and apparently china
[0:12] <Azathoth> i don't kno
[0:12] <blaster> Well If i knew someone in america
[0:12] <Dysgalt> Animator what?
[0:12] <blaster> Ehh thats to complex
[0:12] <Marach-17> hm
[0:12] <Marach-17> what portal mods are worth playing?
[0:12] <Marach-17> /mappacks
[0:12] <Dysgalt> I've been dissecting this site for awhile mostly dead ends.. its a viral site popped up by a anti pirating company :l
[0:12] <Yourself> building a computer yourself is generally cheaper than buying one pre-built
[0:13] <Yourself> at least that's always been the case for me
[0:13] <blaster> Yourself that was the plan
[0:13] <blaster> Two problems though
[0:13] <blaster> 1. Idividual componants are very hard to get here
[0:13] <Azathoth> newegg doesn't ship internationally? :O
[0:13] <blaster> 2. It just never happens here, EVER
[0:13] <Yourself> Azathoth, maybe they do, but i doubt it
[0:13] <Marach-17> portal:prelude is as big as the original game >:(
[0:13] <Azathoth> i feel sorry for the rest of the world
[0:14] <Marach-17> leaving it overnight
[0:14] <Yourself> no, they don't
[0:14] <bildramer> lol
[0:14] <Marach-17> shows 5 hours remaining
[0:14] <Yourself> US and Puerto Rico
[0:14] * fenixfurion|AFK (Fenix@74-140-206-154.dhcp.insightbb.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:14] <blaster> Azathoth, thanks for feeling sorry for me
[0:14] <Marach-17> i guess it's time to...
[0:14] * Marach-17 is now known as Marafk-17
[0:14] <Yourself> Newegg really is amazing, though
[0:14] * blaster thinks Azathoth is more inteligent than most americans
[0:14] * Azathoth thinks so too >_>
[0:14] * fenixfurion|AFK is now known as fenixfurion
[0:14] <Yourself> they have some of the best deals on shit
[0:15] <Azathoth> yeah
[0:15] * Zuggy (Mibbit@c-98-215-153-178.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:15] <blaster> Yourself the websites you use and the ones I am forced to use are different
[0:15] <Azathoth> they have literally saved me hundreds of dollars
[0:15] <blaster> Mainly, things here cost twice as much
[0:15] <blaster> And you get paid half as much
[0:15] <Yourself> like right now, there's a 1 TB HDD for $85
[0:15] <blaster> So everything is 4X harder to get
[0:15] <Yourself> blaster, yes, i know
[0:15] <blaster> Anyway yourself, if I had to run a minecraft server I would use my schools 8TB hard drive
[0:15] <blaster> :D
[0:15] <Azathoth> ah the wonders of OEM
[0:16] <Yourself> in my room i have at least 2 TB of storage
[0:16] <Yourself> i've got a 1TB in my ubuntu machine
[0:16] * Azjherben-Syerjchep wants a TB drive.
[0:16] * Azjherben-Syerjchep .
[0:16] <Yourself> i've got a 512GB external USB
[0:16] * Azjherben-Syerjchep wow.
[0:17] <Yourself> and two 280 GB internal hard drives in this desktop
[0:17] <Yourself> can't remember what my laptop has
[0:17] * Azjherben-Syerjchep half a terabyte flash drive.
[0:17] * Marafk-17 wants a 100gb drive
[0:17] <Iguana> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=12939&start=0
[0:17] <Iguana> I bet you anything.
[0:17] * Azathoth only has a total of 750 GB :(
[0:17] <Iguana> FLAME WAR?!
[0:18] <Azathoth> i miss my old 3 GB hard drive
[0:18] * blaster has a 280 GB HD and only 60GB space left
[0:18] <Yourself> oh, let's look at the solid state hard drives
[0:18] <Azathoth> when i installed age of empires 2
[0:18] <blaster> I miss my 98
[0:18] <Azathoth> and it took up a sixth of my hard drive space
[0:18] * outsomnia (wahaha@64.134.223.222) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:18] <Marafk-17> blaster: only?
[0:18] <Yourself> $364 for 120 GB
[0:18] <Marafk-17> that's more than my hd
[0:19] <blaster> 6I am running out of space
[0:19] <Azathoth> give solid state a few years
[0:19] <blaster> And I dont use any storage other that HD
[0:19] <Azathoth> and it will be all anybody uses ><
[0:19] <Yourself> yeah
[0:19] <PuyoDead> I've got a TERRORBYTE.
[0:19] <Azathoth> can't wait
[0:19] <Zuggy> Oh snap, terrorbyte.
[0:19] <Azathoth> :O
[0:19] <blaster> Azathoth I thought of a extremely dense data storage system
[0:19] <Dysgalt> I've got 4 terrorbytes :v
[0:20] <blaster> Rotate a molecule into 256 directions
[0:20] <Azathoth> om nom nom
[0:20] <blaster> And you can store 1 byte per molecule
[0:20] <Azathoth> erm
[0:20] <blaster> Which is close to the absolute limit
[0:20] <Yourself> blaster, you need to learn more about physics first
[0:20] <Azathoth> lol
[0:20] <Dysgalt> quantumn computing biatch?
[0:20] <blaster> I know its stupid yourself
[0:20] <blaster> Because reading something that tiny would cause it to move, uncertainty principle
[0:20] <Azathoth> i don't want to talk to a scientist
[0:20] <blaster> FUCK YOU UNCERTANTY PRINCIPLE
[0:20] <bildramer> ....
[0:21] <Azathoth> all their lieing is getting me pissed
[0:21] * TheClassiestMedic (Kevjohnson@static-108-1-135-169.bstnma.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:21] <Zuggy> Dude, the uncertainty principle is awesome.
[0:21] <Yourself> speaking of single molecules, they recently did a quantum computation on a single molecule
[0:21] <Zuggy> Electrons can, and sometimes must be in several places at the same time.
[0:21] <Yourself> i think it was a discrete FFT
[0:21] <bildramer> yeah
[0:21] <bildramer> split personalities
[0:21] <Azathoth> i did a quantum computation on your face
[0:21] <bildramer> sometimes wavey
[0:21] <Animator> Alright, meningray must be a viral site.
[0:21] <bildramer> sometimes particly
[0:22] <blaster> The future of computing lies in data which instead of just on and off, has more states
[0:22] <Animator> Hinting to something far greater.
[0:22] <bildramer> blaster stfu
[0:22] <blaster> That will begin happening once we reach the limit of tiny
[0:22] <Yourself> http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-05/single-molecule-computes-thousands-times-faster-your-pc
[0:22] <Azathoth> bildramer, stfu
[0:22] * Dudebro_ (Dudebro@32.169.4.32) Quit (Quit: Get FlowChat for the iPhone and iPod Touch! http://flowchat.me)
[0:22] <Zuggy> I just watched the whole Stephen Hawking: Master of the Universe special thing the other day.
[0:22] <Azathoth> let the man talk
[0:22] <bildramer> quantum computing makes storing data impossible
[0:22] <Azathoth> blaster is the next gordon freeman
[0:22] <Zuggy> Talking about his quest for a unified theory of Everything.
[0:22] <bildramer> there's a fucking great chance we don't know what the fuck a bit wat
[0:22] <bildramer> was*
[0:23] <blaster> And helping stupid scientists open portals to alien worlds
[0:23] <Yourself> <blaster> The future of computing lies in data which instead of just on and off, has more states
[0:23] <Yourself> mmmmm...no
[0:23] <bildramer> ^&
[0:23] <blaster> MMM necisary simply because if 1 bit is one atom, you cannot realy get much smaller
[0:23] <Azathoth> ITT: making everything we know about computing obsolete
[0:23] <blaster> ITT: Brains melt
[0:23] <bildramer> um
[0:23] <bildramer> blaster
[0:23] <Yourself> yes, that's an absolute physical limit
[0:23] <Zuggy> Quarks brah.
[0:24] <Azathoth> fucking quarks
[0:24] <Azathoth> how do they work!?
[0:24] <bildramer> computers handling 1 atom correctly = fucking impossible
[0:24] <Yourself> magic and shit
[0:24] <Marafk-17> there are smaller things than atoms, you know
[0:24] <bildramer> if we had that we could easily convert matter to energy
[0:24] <bildramer> yes
[0:24] <blaster> Free floating quarks would just blow up your house
[0:24] <Azathoth> magic all up in this bitch
[0:24] <blaster> So dont...
[0:24] <bildramer> nanomachines ftw btw
[0:24] <Marafk-17> 1337ing. bye
[0:24] <blaster> OH WAIT, smallest element, Positrionium
[0:24] * Ten_Tacles (Mibbit@levk-4db48c81.pool.mediaWays.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[0:24] <Quatroking> fucking miracles
[0:24] <bildramer> lolol
[0:24] <bildramer> fucking magnets
[0:24] <blaster> It weighs about 1/4000 of hydrogen
[0:24] <Quatroking> HOW DO THEY WORK
[0:25] <Yourself> free floating quarks wouldn't do anything
[0:25] <bildramer> blaster, wat
[0:25] <bildramer> link
[0:25] <Yourself> mostly because they don't exist
[0:25] <bildramer> isn't that 1 positron + 1 electron somehow stabilized?
[0:25] <bildramer> that won't annihilate
[0:25] <blaster> Yes
[0:25] <Zuggy> UNPOSSIBLE
[0:25] <blaster> It is stable
[0:25] <bildramer> and good job if you can keep that moving steadily inside anything with a magnetic field
[0:25] <blaster> It has already been proven it can make molecules with hydrogen
[0:25] <blaster> It fits the requirement of a atom
[0:25] <bildramer> no
[0:26] <Animator> Hoooooooly shit that suitcase better be real.
[0:26] <blaster> Apart from a nucleus
[0:26] <bildramer> yes
[0:26] <Quatroking> but
[0:26] <Quatroking> but
[0:26] <bildramer> no, wait
[0:26] <bildramer> no
[0:26] <Quatroking> thats predictably unpredictable!
[0:26] <bildramer> where are the shells?
[0:26] <Yourself> <blaster> It has already been proven it can make molecules with hydrogen
[0:26] <Yourself> article?
[0:26] <blaster> Bildramer the shell is the whole atom
[0:26] <bildramer> hahahahaha no
[0:26] <bildramer> they can't even have charge
[0:26] <Yourself> i've only ever heard of observations of di-positronium molecules
[0:27] <blaster> http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9804023v1
[0:27] <blaster> Also bildramer, you could stick neutrons in the middle
[0:27] <blaster> In theory
[0:27] * TheClassiestMedic (Kevjohnson@static-108-1-135-169.bstnma.east.verizon.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:27] <bildramer> holy shit
[0:28] <bildramer> whatever
[0:28] <Yourself> what would hold a neutron there?
[0:28] * vLK (vLK@c83-254-232-198.bredband.comhem.se) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:28] <Yourself> it has no charge
[0:28] <bildramer> let's go nuclear fusion
[0:28] * lefishy (lefishy@cpc3-newt29-2-0-cust66.newt.cable.virginmedia.com) has left #minecraft
[0:28] <bildramer> oh, trye
[0:28] <bildramer> true*
[0:28] <bildramer> it would beta decay
[0:28] <bildramer> into a proton
[0:28] <blaster> Atoms are supposed to have no charge
[0:28] <bildramer> and then BAM positron flies away
[0:28] <blaster> Otherwise they go haywire
[0:28] <bildramer> I know
[0:28] <bildramer> uh
[0:28] <Yourself> otherwise they're ions :P
[0:28] <bildramer> but that doesn't even have a nucleus
[0:28] <blaster> Strong nuclear force (I think) holds em together
[0:28] <bildramer> it can't lose or gain any more particles
[0:28] * Slash-Caps (Slash-caps@94-195-154-156.zone9.bethere.co.uk) Quit (Quit: To the Bat mobile!)
[0:28] <bildramer> haha no
[0:28] <bildramer> electromagnetic force does
[0:28] * Slash-Caps (Slash-caps@94-195-154-156.zone9.bethere.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
[0:28] <bildramer> only
[0:29] <blaster> I am on about the nucleus
[0:29] <blaster> Thats why you get glueballs
[0:29] <bildramer> wat
[0:29] <Azjherben-Syerjchep> back
[0:29] <bildramer> what nucleus?
[0:29] * opaaa (opa@a91-154-233-44.elisa-laajakaista.fi) has joined #minecraft
[0:29] * TheClassiestMedic (Kevjohnson@static-108-1-135-169.bstnma.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:29] <Yourself> strong nuclear force holds protons and neutrons together
[0:29] <bildramer> and back on topic, how should that thing store information?
[0:29] * Brick (Brick@pool-71-184-110-176.bstnma.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[0:29] <bildramer> it has 1 state, being there
[0:29] <Yourself> in fact that's the entire reason neutrons exist
[0:29] <Yourself> to stabilize heavier elements
[0:29] <bildramer> yep
[0:29] <bildramer> in nuclei
[0:29] <blaster> The Wall Street Journal reported on July 13, 1992, that "the chemical compound, called positronium
[0:29] <blaster> hydride, existed for a brief moment in a laboratory in Denmark." Positronium hydride is a hydrogen
[0:29] <blaster> molecule with one of its two protons replaced by a positron.
[0:30] <Yourself> otherwise the electromagnetic force would blast the protons apart
[0:30] <bildramer> wait what
[0:30] <blaster> Thats the proof
[0:30] <bildramer> a positron? strong nuclear wat wat
[0:30] <bildramer> impossible I tell ya
[0:30] <TheClassiestMedic> No, the whole usiverse exists because of neutrinos!
[0:30] <Zuggy> Fuckin neutrinos.
[0:30] <blaster> No, the whole universe exists coz god took a massive shit
[0:30] <TheClassiestMedic> They're hitting you right now
[0:30] <bildramer> hydride?
[0:30] <blaster> Which is why the world stinks
[0:30] <bildramer> that is more like H2O
[0:30] <TheClassiestMedic> And going right through you
[0:30] <Yourself> TheClassiestMedic, they're not hitting you
[0:30] <TheClassiestMedic> and the earth
[0:31] <Yourself> because they can't hit anything
[0:31] <Zuggy> :O
[0:31] <TheClassiestMedic> They can
[0:31] <Yourself> they pass through you
[0:31] <bildramer> no
[0:31] <TheClassiestMedic> They just rarely do
[0:31] <bildramer> lol
[0:31] <Zuggy> Fre radicals?
[0:31] * opa (opa@a91-154-233-44.elisa-laajakaista.fi) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:31] <Azathoth> i can't hit anything either :(
[0:31] <Zuggy> *Free
[0:31] <bildramer> they only collide to each other etc.
[0:31] <TheClassiestMedic> Like hitting a balloon with a dart
[0:31] <TheClassiestMedic> sometimes you miss
[0:31] <TheClassiestMedic> sometimes you hit
[0:31] <bildramer> and those are the reason we can't have nigh-free energy
[0:31] <TheClassiestMedic> when you do hit
[0:31] <blaster> Hey guys interesting fact. No element beyond 94 can be remotely stable
[0:31] <TheClassiestMedic> the dart keeps on going
[0:31] <blaster> Because otherwise it would be found naturaly
[0:31] <Azathoth> hey guys interesting fact: herp derp
[0:31] <Yourself> which isn't a hit, because it didn't interact
[0:31] <bildramer> lol
[0:32] <TrueWolves> Well
[0:32] <blaster> Hey guys interesting fact: I started a meme
[0:32] <TrueWolves> technicaly
[0:32] <bildramer> you're missing a point there
[0:32] <blaster> FACEPALM
[0:32] <TrueWolves> Urananium isn't stable either
[0:32] <bildramer> wat
[0:32] <Azathoth> neither is my mental state
[0:32] <TrueWolves> just the most stable isotopes have insanely long half lifes
[0:32] <blaster> Uranium is reletivly stable in the lifespan of the solar system
[0:32] <TrueWolves> Yeah
[0:32] <blaster> I mean things with a half life of 20,000 +
[0:32] <Azathoth> truewolves just officially changed the conversation topic to half-life
[0:32] <Azathoth> gordon freeman, gogo
[0:32] * Wirtualnosc (wirtualnos@chello089072117196.chello.pl) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:32] <TrueWolves> It's not /stable/ but it lasts long enough to be found naturualy on earth
[0:32] * blaster gets up
[0:32] <bildramer> lol
[0:33] <bildramer> quarter life
[0:33] <blaster> Did anyone say BLASTER FREEMAN
[0:33] <Yourself> U 238 has a half-life of some 4.5 billion years

[0:33] <bildramer> who cares
[0:33] <blaster> Nomnomnom
[0:33] <TrueWolves> Which begs the question, how heavy do elements get when they are created in novas and super novas? perhaps elements past 100 in atomic size are created, just they don't last long.
[0:33] <bildramer> oh noes where id isotop
[0:33] <bildramer> uit has been stoled
[0:33] <blaster> Truewolves, it is possible that elements with numbers in the millions are created
[0:33] <blaster> And are so huge you can see them
[0:34] <TrueWolves> ... that be awesome.
[0:34] <Yourself> no, i very much doubt that
[0:34] <TrueWolves> But highly unlikely

[0:37] <bildramer> there are 4

[0:42] <bildramer> ponies
[0:42] <bildramer> blaster, I do that
[0:42] <Azathoth> they're dependent on more than just our own matter and shit
[0:42] <bildramer> we can change nothing
[0:42] <bildramer> even us thinking this isn't changeable
[0:42] <bildramer> there are no decisions etc. etc.
[0:43] <Azathoth> but the idea that we have true free will and such is an illusion
[0:43] <blaster> Except in the instance of radioactive decay
[0:43] <Yourself> seeing as how the body interacts with its environment constantly, no, it doesn't depend on the atoms in your body when you are "created"
[0:43] <blaster> lets say it takes one more beta particle to give you cancer, but it decided not to decay
[0:43] <TrueWolves> Thing is
[0:43] <blaster> Ok yourself, the position of everything

[0:46] <TrueWolves> If everything will happen becuase of something else by a completely predictable pattren, this pattren can never be duplicated in are universe with out recreating it, which is impossable to simulate, thus given an unpredicable future, it don't matter if we have freewill or if everything is set in stone, you still make the actions that cause things to happen. So you doing nothing or something is still disisided by your mind... abstra
[0:46] <TrueWolves> <Cutoff> your mind... abstractly.

[0:47] <bildramer> orly
[0:47] <Azathoth> HOW DOES IT WORK
[0:47] <Zuggy> Ask Dan Brown.
[0:47] <blaster> It just does
[0:47] <Zuggy> He knows loads about antimatter, amirite?
[0:47] <blaster> The answer to why does it work: It just fucking does
[0:48] <bildramer> and I wonder why the universe is made of matter and not antimatter
[0:48] <Azathoth> fucking blaster
[0:48] <Azathoth> how does it work
[0:48] <bildramer> er
[0:48] <Yourself> TrueWolves, i have to say that that's actually very well thought out and mirrors my own position pretty well except for the spelling errors
[0:48] <bildramer> I mean why it's not like 50%
[0:48] <bildramer> and we see no antimatter stars etc.
[0:48] <blaster> Bildramer the reason is because if antimater won we would just call it matter and call normal matter antimatter
[0:48] <TrueWolves> Sorry about my spelling Yourself. ^.^;
[0:48] <blaster> Thats why
[0:48] <blaster> So no matter what we will always end up in a 'matter' universe because we just name things like that
[0:48] <bildramer> <bildramer> I mean why it's not like 50%
[0:48] <blaster> Because it all got anialated and shit
[0:49] <Yourself> baryon asymmetry
[0:49] <bildramer> ...
[0:49] <Azathoth> anyway. i'm gonna go suck a cock now

[0:49] <TrueWolves> It's accualy got a lot of evedince behind it.
[0:50] <Azathoth> oh lord
[0:50] <bildramer> if the universe has more than 3 dimensions, we may actually be in a symmetrical one

[0:56] <Yourself> he could go on to explain about magnetic fields

[0:56] <vurtual> then there's the weaker gravity force which is caused by being your mother.

[1:01] <Yourself> i'm not trying to be a dick, i'm trying to avoid deriving the entirety of the theory of electromagnetism in IRC
[1:01] <Visiiri> I think that I'm going to put child pornography in my PE teacher's desk.
[1:01] <Visiiri> He deserves it.
[1:01] <vurtual> Nobody here expects that I'm actually highly trained for social situations, and that I simply act howeveer I do because it fits me in best.
[1:01] <Yourself> which i'd then have to couple in with special relativity and quantum mechanics
[1:01] <blaster> Its a decent game, but I could not imagine getting more than 20 hours multiplayer out of it
[1:01] <gear1> bc2 is so much better imo
[1:01] <vede> Yourself, but you still have not explained the methodology by which they attract. You've simply noted that magnets are composed of smaller components, which attract or repel each other.

[1:02] <blaster> Actualy that would be a EPIC game
[1:02] <blaster> For the internets
[1:02] <Yourself> because it turns into a question of how deep you want me to go
[1:02] <Visiiri> You can use Baby Panay's head as a wrecking ball

[1:02] <Visiiri> and it works
[1:02] <gear1> yea its true
[1:02] <bildramer> guys

[1:03] <blaster> What....
[1:03] <gear1> basically force push everything around
[1:03] <Yourself> i can't explain them away
[1:03] <Yourself> you're asking a question that doesn't make sense
[1:04] <Yourself> or your expecting an answer that can't be given
[1:04] <blaster> FUCKING MONOPOLES HOW DO THEY WORK?
[1:04] <Yourself> i don't know, because i obviously don't understand what you're asking
[1:04] <vede> Yourself, I'm asking a question that makes perfect sense. You're answering it by saying that the answer is, in fact, the answer.
[1:05] <blaster> Monopole = a magnet with either + or - but not both

[1:05] <blaster> ANTINUMBERS YES
[1:05] <vede> Yourself, I'll try to make it as clear as possible.
[1:05] <vurtual> DO NOT FORGET WHICH SIDE GOES CLOSER OR FARTHER AWAY OR IT'LL CRUSH YOUR HAND
[1:05] <vurtual> OR ESCAPE YOUR GRASP

[1:11] <vede> Here's a question, Yourself: if it's so hard to formulate a question specific enough for the questionee to know *precisely* what it is you want to know (for instance, the magnetism question), what is the problem with making use of a chain of multiple questions of increasing depth to find the knowledge you're looking for?
[1:11] <blaster> Anyway how about them gemcraft
[1:12] <blaster> FUCKING MINECRAFT how does it work?
[1:12] <Visiiri> ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww => it has aids => I have aids from it => I'm sad

[1:13] <vurtual> I found a garry's mod map that is basically a part of the hl2 coast, with more buildings, and at night.
[1:13] <vurtual> It's scary
[1:13] <vurtual> PLus ear-ringing confusing dizziness really made it unsettling

[1:13] <Kodaichi> hey guys, who here is afraid of clowns?
[1:13] <Yourself> because apparently the interviewer was satisfied
[1:13] <Visiiri> i'm shit afraid of clows

[1:14] <Kodaichi> I'm interested in why so many people are.
[1:14] <blaster> Why 4D?
[1:14] <Yourself> lol, "that Richard guy"
[1:14] <vede> He just said that basically, he didn't know the depth that the questioner was intending to find, so he wouldn't even start the process and left the interviewer emptyhanded.
[1:14] <Visiiri> blaster: 3d voxels aren't dynamic

[1:17] <Dysgalt> Hes also a minecrafter
[1:17] <blaster> Fucking Fucking how does it work?

[1:18] <Yourself> and gravitational fields affect masses
[1:19] <blaster> Who here has played gemcraft chapter 0
[1:19] <Yourself> a magnetic field will create a force on a charged particle that is moving through it
[1:19] * sllide (ekstezie@ip565eb113.direct-adsl.nl) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[1:19] <Yourself> in math terms, F = q v x B
[1:20] <Yourself> where F is the vector force, q is the charge, v is the vector velocity of that charge, and B is the magnetic field at the location of the particle
[1:20] <bildramer> in layman's terms, little balls move and make magic work
[1:20] <Yourself> there's also a formula for computing the magnetic field vector at a given point given some moving charge
[1:20] <Yourself> it's given by Biot-Savart law and I won't post it here
[1:20] <Yourself> it's a bit more complicated
[1:21] <Yourself> so, we've established that moving charges create magnetic fields
[1:21] <blaster> FUCKING GRAVITY how does it work?
[1:21] <blaster> Dont answer that, I already know
[1:21] <Yourself> and moving charges are affected by magnetic fields
[1:21] <Yourself> this is the mechanism by which magnetism work

[1:22] <blaster> Wooo grade 5 gems on round 13, thats good!
[1:22] <Yourself> now, a more fundamental question, why do moving charges create magnetic fields?
[1:23] <Yourself> this goes to special relativity

[1:24] <blaster> Erg... 31 I think
[1:24] <TrueWolves> ... thats my skillset as well!
[1:24] <Yourself> or, actually, let me go with a different example
[1:24] <blaster> Not entirely certain
[1:24] <Yourself> imagine you have just one charged particle
[1:24] * TrueWolves is around level 60 though. XD same skill set though
[1:24] <blaster> Nah its not that high
[1:24] <Yourself> and you look at the electric field it produces because of its charge

[1:24] <TrueWolves> I focus on as many points and mana as possable using dual gems.

[1:24] <Yourself> its field lines will go out in all directions and will be spaced equally
[1:24] <DimJim> helo
[1:24] <TrueWolves> oh'
[1:24] <blaster> I like survival mode (Not minecraft)
[1:24] <Plago> I didnt know you liked MC
[1:24] <TrueWolves> I also focus a lot on raw stats
[1:25] <blaster> Same here
[1:25] <TrueWolves> Thanks to being level 60ish, all my +Stat skills are maxed
[1:25] <blaster> At least, when I have a level that high I will
[1:25] * Plago (Mibbit@83.52.11.35) has left #minecraft
[1:25] <Yourself> now, if you start the particle moving, special relativity predicts that you will observe a length contraction of that charged particle
[1:25] <Yourself> this length contraction also applies to its electric field
[1:25] <TrueWolves> The sad thing blaster? I've haven't beaten a single level past the first boss
[1:25] <blaster> OH MY GOD
[1:25] <TrueWolves> I keep redoing the extra versions of the first level set
[1:25] <TrueWolves> XD
[1:25] <Yourself> so its electric field lines will get bunched up in the plane perpendicular to the particle's motion
[1:25] <blaster> I dont get enough extra versions to do that
[1:25] <TrueWolves> I almost have done every level up to the first boss on every setting so far. XD
[1:26] <blaster> Seriously
[1:26] <Yourself> and spread out in front of and behind it
[1:26] <TrueWolves> I score /high/
[1:26] * TrueWolves is good at Gem Craft, =3

[1:26] <blaster> Truewolves the next set of levels will be easy
[1:26] <bildramer> :3
[1:26] * Varriount is now known as Vgor
[1:26] <Yourself> the magnetic field exists to sort of counteract this effect
[1:26] <TrueWolves> Level 60 and I haven't even done the first level after the first boss... XD
[1:26] <blaster> Actualy no, the second set of levels are evil
[1:26] <Yourself> which is why it only exists when the particle is moving
[1:26] <blaster> Because the way the paths are set gives you very little area where towers would work
[1:27] <blaster> And almost no room for traps
[1:27] <Yourself> if you move with the particle, the magnetic field disappears and your own length contraction will make the charged particle appear as normal
[1:27] <TrueWolves> Do you ever gem bomb to summon monsters blaster?
[1:27] <bildramer> FUCKING BIGNUMS
[1:27] <TrueWolves> That's one way I get my scores so high

[1:28] <TrueWolves> 10 or 20 bombs, 1~2 per round
[1:28] <TrueWolves> for the bonus reward at the end of the level

[3:13] <vurtual> until all you can do is wobble, while they lurch you into walls.
[3:14] <vede> Hmm...
[3:14] <CruelNoise> poison should be somewhat liek burn
[3:14] <vurtual> Then they jump off, and you slam into the wall, and they run away.
[3:14] <CruelNoise> 'cept it wears off before you die

[3:26] <bildramer> fffffff
[3:27] <Malikat> pi is closest
[3:27] <vede> CruelNoise, but you also have to take into account the fact that even if people in extremely urban environments have more or worse allergies, they probably come into contact with the things they're allergic to far less often than one would in a rural environment.
[3:27] <bildramer> not the point
[3:27] <CruelNoise> why?
[3:27] <CruelNoise> vede, why?
[3:27] <CruelNoise> you can't assume things like that.
[3:27] <bildramer> btw why the fuck do they have so much stuff on percents?
[3:27] <Malikat> vede: the over exposure to the chemicals and shit will cause new allergies
[3:28] <bildramer> are they really retarded? Germans can't learn that simple shit
[3:28] <vede> Because there's a higher density of things like concrete and steel in urban environments than in rural environments.
[3:28] <bildramer> % == /100
[3:28] <bildramer> there
[3:28] <bildramer> fixed

[3:49] <bildramer> lol
[3:49] <bildramer> D:
[3:49] <bildramer> noes
[3:49] <CruelNoise> and we can have glatitorial games where we kill all of them in quake
[3:49] <Visiiri> CDs are bad
[3:49] <bildramer> lolol
[3:50] <Shadaez> bildramer wait does that actually work
[3:50] <CruelNoise> gladiatorial*
[3:50] <bildramer> nuclear fusion ftw
[3:50] <Shadaez> lol jk fgt
[3:50] <bildramer> Shadaez, yes
[3:50] <bildramer> it dls 4GB of 00s
[3:50] <bildramer> MORE RAM
[3:50] <CruelNoise> placebos are ftw
[3:50] <Visiiri> Nuclear fusion isn't ftw
[3:50] <bildramer> yes it is
[3:50] <Shadaez> I've been doing it all day, I probably have around 200GB!
[3:50] <bildramer> why not
[3:50] <CruelNoise> i don't like drugs
[3:50] <Yourself> wow, this penumbra overture game is some scary shit
[3:51] <Visiiri> Because it's not effective yet.
[3:51] <bildramer> that's what has been giving us energy for millions of years
[3:51] <bildramer> heck yes it is
[3:51] <Visiiri> It takes more energy to do than it releases.
[3:51] <Iguana> Fuuuu
[3:51] <Shadaez> Yourself just beat the dogs down with a barrel.
[3:51] <CruelNoise> isn't it nuclear fission?
[3:51] <Iguana> My pred ended halfway because the game ended

[3:51] <Rooster> *Hey guys Steam actually works*
[3:51] <bildramer> lol
[3:51] <CruelNoise> anyone know why tes arena crashes when i exit the first dungeon?
[3:51] <Rooster> Just throwing it out there
[3:51] <Visiiri> But currently, no man made objects can perform nuclear fusion efficiently.
[3:52] <bildramer> currently is the keyword
[3:52] <Shadaez> I wish TES: Arena and Daggerfall had conrols I could understand.
[3:52] <Azathoth> poor penumbra
[3:52] <bildramer> well whatever
[3:52] <bildramer> solar power ftw
[3:52] <Azathoth> no one appreciates lovecraftian horror
[3:52] <CruelNoise> you can map DOSbox, you know
[3:52] <Azathoth> so they're just all like "lol shit game. just kill the dogs with a barrel"
[3:52] <bildramer> ...
[3:52] <Visiiri> CruelNoise: Fission is splitting the nucleus, fusion is merging two nuclei together.
[3:52] <CruelNoise> makes sense
[3:52] <Yourself> there are no dogs yet
[3:52] <CruelNoise> i learned something today
[3:52] <bildramer> kick the dog -> TV Tropes D:
[3:52] <Shadaez> Azathoth, no the game freaks me out, I just replayed it though and beat the dog down with a huge barrel. It was great.
[3:53] <Yourself> just a bunch of noises that scare the bejesus out of you
[3:53] <bildramer> btw
[3:53] <Azathoth> just saying. i think penumbra is underrated
[3:53] <bildramer> using both fission and fusion, we can get craploads of iron
[3:53] <Shadaez> It's very good :)

[4:03] <vurtual> whose lasers were partially organic, and also grew in power
[4:04] <vurtual> and instead of JUST growing, it became a megolodon sharktank.
[4:05] <vurtual> and l4d2-smoker-tongue like genetics give it random laser eyes all over its body, which can damage you a bit if they target you(they can target everyoen at once if need be), and regenerate from the sharktank's health(who cannot be damaged otherwise), also setting you on fire(turning a chunk of your hp into non-permenant hp)

[5:59] <vurtual> even the guys can do girls
[5:59] <vurtual> and the girls can do guys

[6:02] <EmpiresBane> ok... my xbox thinks my flashdrive is a camera
[6:02] <vurtual> I can't do female voice imitations for some strange reason.
[6:02] <vurtual> I could, as a kid, even involuntarily, but not anymore.

[6:07] <EmpiresBane> you just don't know how to whistle
[6:07] <vurtual> Not voluntarily
[6:07] <Brahman> Seem's like non-whistlers are in the majority here.
[6:07] <vurtual> I can accidentally whistle
[6:07] <vurtual> but then if I do EXACTLY THAT
[6:07] <vurtual> it will not work
[6:07] <EmpiresBane> that's why
[6:07] <EmpiresBane> just try random shit until you get something
[6:08] <vurtual> it never works
[6:08] <wry> same here
[6:08] <vurtual> If I do exact "whistling actions" as anyone says, they don't work.
[6:08] <vurtual> Then randomly I'll just whistle out of nowhere for a split second, notice it, and stop.
[6:08] <EmpiresBane> don't listen to people
[6:08] <vurtual> even if I do EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING AT THE TIME, it does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
[6:08] <wry> the most i've managed is a "wind blowing" whistle

[6:28] <liq3> I've wanted something like that myself.
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> Alexander, i think the leaning over the edge is still better
[6:28] <liq3> Make bridge building easy.
[6:29] <liq3> EmpiresBane: i don't... I think it's silly. :/
[6:29] <Alexander> leaning + that system = building down
[6:29] <EmpiresBane> why would you wan't to build down?
[6:29] <Alexander> prevent fall damage
[6:29] <eritz> minecraft's not balanced for lean
[6:29] <EmpiresBane> eritz, what?
[6:29] <liq3> EmpiresBane: also the bridge lean thing makes attacking floating inverted pymarid fortress impossible.
[6:30] <EmpiresBane> not really
[6:30] <liq3> Yes... Can't go below due to inverted pyramid.
[6:30] <EmpiresBane> get close enough, then mine the wall
[6:30] <liq3> Attacking from side = pin cushioned.
[6:31] <liq3> you'd need to literally zerg them...
[6:31] <liq3> And build like a 3 wide bridge...
[6:31] <liq3> Did I mention they can destroy the bridge while you're building it? ;/
[6:31] <EmpiresBane> whoever makes a giant floating inverted pyramid is obviously going to have some sort of entrance

[6:31] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> wait.... in order to destroy your bridge, they'd have to break their wall
[6:32] <liq3> EmpiresBane: while that'd probably work, it'd take so damn long to do... an hour + just to build it.
[6:32] <liq3> EmpiresBane: while you're building it they'd have plenty of time to build their own, and rain arrows on you.
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> or at least be close enough to shoot back
[6:32] <liq3> you can't...
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> why?
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> because they have force fields?
[6:32] <liq3> they'd have the room to build a tower, while you're stuck to 1 wide bridges. one hit = you probably fall off and di.
[6:33] <liq3> they won't fall off and die. :p

[6:34] <eritz> fusing blocks together ahead of time
[6:34] <liq3> I mean one idea that'd ALMOST work is building a tower with meatshields at the front (yay?) in full armour...
[6:34] <liq3> Except when you got to theirs, they'd have no problem swording you to death.
[6:35] <eritz> imagine if you could make 3x1 stone blocks at home, before you go out to assault the fortress
[6:35] <liq3> from above.
[6:35] <eritz> that would be helpful, wouldn't it?
[6:35] <liq3> or droppingg tnt on you.
[6:35] <liq3> eritz: ... it'd be rather silly.
[6:35] <eritz> it'd allow you to raise a triple-wide bridge faster
[6:35] <liq3> eritz: i don't see what it has to do with this conversation either.
[6:36] <eritz> you'd only have to align and lay one 'block', instead of three

[6:38] <Dommys> Making sky building Easier is a sad idea.
[6:38] <eritz> it is indeed
[6:38] <liq3> The entire reason a floating fortress is hard to assault is because you can't sneak up on it.
[6:38] <eritz> you can sneak up on anything
[6:38] <Dommys> I enjoy the challenge of falling to my doom whilst building huge things
[6:39] <eritz> just requires some ingenuity

[6:39] <Dommys> I enjoy good Streams, like Malikat

[6:40] <Dommys> He's always entertaining aside from just playing though.
[6:40] <eritz> they fucking trick him
[6:40] <liq3> eritz: XD
[6:40] <liq3> Unfortunately MC isn't a book.
[6:40] <Dommys> Some of the other streams I've seen weren't nearly as wonderous.
[6:40] <eritz> they sneak up on him by doing something outlandish and crafty
[6:41] <eritz> using a suicide attack on the front gate to compel his entire army away
[6:42] <liq3> eritz: a flying fortress has no front gate.
[6:43] <eritz> yes it does
[6:43] <eritz> you, yourself, said that there are ways to assault a flying fortress that are obvious, and are practically suicide
[6:43] <eritz> this is the "front gate"
[6:43] <liq3> And how are you gonna sneak up on them?
[6:43] <liq3> >.> <.<
[6:44] <eritz> by doing something less obvious elsewhere, while the obvious attack is distracting them

[6:46] <Dommys> It's not your fault Visiiri, I just have a boner for Mali for some reason.
[6:46] <eritz> people are not smart
[6:46] <liq3> You're assuming the defenders are stupidier then the attackers.
[6:46] <liq3> By a large margin.
[6:47] <eritz> well, this is similar to security holes in software and hardware
[6:47] <eritz> you have to defend thousands of attack vectors in your software
[6:47] <eritz> the attackers need only find one

[6:47] <Visiiri> I'll bet you mob spawn hacks are present
[6:47] <jayz> how the hell do i get a pickaxe or so
[6:48] <jayz> in indeev.
[6:48] <liq3> eritz: also according to the thread, we're getting it anyway. :p
[6:48] <jayz> indev*
[6:48] <liq3> jayz: mine wood, make wood pickaxe, mine stone, make stone pickaxe, ???, profit.
[6:48] <jayz> Wait, how much wood do i need?
[6:48] <jayz> and what other stuff.
[6:48] <jayz> or is it just wood.
[6:48] <eritz> other helpful things to give you the element of surprise are tunnels, water, cover of darkness
[6:49] <eritz> you could actually be directly underneath your target well before they even know you're around
[6:49] <Firetempest> need one chunk for a wookbench, another chunk to make 4 sicks for 2 items
[6:49] <liq3> eritz: the flying fortress makes 2 of those useless... I don't see any real way to use water either.
[6:49] <eritz> they're note useless
[6:49] <eritz> not*
[6:49] <Firetempest> another chunk for atleast 3 planks for your first wood pickaxe
[6:49] <liq3> Ok darkness isn't, tunnels help you get under it.
[6:49] <jayz> Uh, I'm still a bit confused. So, I start off with...?
[6:49] <liq3> They aren't enough to break it though.

[6:50] <jayz> perfect.
[6:50] <jayz> thanks.

[6:50] <liq3> Oh actually they could have an entrance.
[6:50] <liq3> An extremely exposed staircase. :D
[6:50] <eritz> if you're directly under them, they may even have trouble seeing you
[6:50] <liq3> enemies climbing it would be pincushioned.
[6:50] <eritz> assuming the floor isn't made of glass
[6:51] <vurtual> that
[6:51] <liq3> Well that's why you do the inverted pyramid.
[6:51] <vurtual> was one of the ugliest attempts at a reskin, ever.
[6:51] <eritz> and, even assuming it was, that's as much an advantage to you as it is to them
[6:51] <eritz> since you can see through them
[6:51] * Scrippy (Scrippy@129.2.141.1) has joined #minecraft
[6:51] <liq3> the inverted pyramid fixes the "i can't see you" issue.
[6:51] <eritz> how?
[6:51] <liq3> ...it lets you see directly down almost.
[6:51] <eritz> there have to be blind spots
[6:52] <liq3> moving around you can easily see 360 degrees.
[6:52] <eritz> besides, this all assumes they have a man keeping watch all the time
[6:52] <eritz> if nobody's watching, it doesn't matter how good the view is
[6:52] <liq3> Damn you're right. I never thought about assaulting an EMPTY CASTLE.
[6:52] <eritz> not necessarily empty
[6:52] * chac (chatzilla@ip56582c0f.direct-adsl.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[6:52] <eritz> but, if someone is doing something inside their castle, they're probably not sitting in the guard post watching the ground for random intruders
[6:52] <liq3> If they don't have someone on watch.
[6:52] <eritz> that's just boring
[6:52] <liq3> THey might as well have built it on the ground, with a moat.
[6:53] <vurtual> Here's my idea.
[6:53] <vurtual> Hide our fortresses deep within moutnains.
[6:53] <vurtual> at mountaintops
[6:53] <liq3> eritz: people not being on watch is a flaw in ANY castle. Not specific to floating ones.
[6:53] <vurtual> with security locks
[6:53] <vurtual> that don't work without proper technology.
[6:53] <eritz> yes, people being on watch IS a flaw

[6:54] <liq3> vurtual: make sure shooting them opens the doors.
[6:54] <eritz> a flaw that is going to be exploitable
[6:54] <vurtual> no you have to have more advanced ways.
[6:54] <vurtual> so if a guy tries to enter, he just sees a mysterious door, that has no form of opening.
[6:54] <liq3> nono i mean shooting the keypads.
[6:54] <Scrippy> Floating > nonfloating.
[6:54] <vurtual> not keypads
[6:54] <liq3> Well you'd have keypads for inside right?
[6:54] <vurtual> nope
[6:54] <vurtual> same system, both sides
[6:54] <vurtual> then if he has whatever fancy magic helmet thing, he can see all the lock controls, and unlock the door.
[6:54] <Inside> yeah, you'd think he would!
[6:54] <LuciferZ> Guys, come watch me draw on livestream.
[6:55] <Firetempest> its not good game mechanics if one person is stuck or someone has to be rotated into being a lookout for random people who may or may not attack. and they do nothing but watch.
[6:55] <liq3> vurtual: well if he has the helmet shooting them should open them!
[6:55] <eritz> right
[6:55] <LuciferZ> But first someone tell me why the recursive livestream gets louder and louder
[6:55] <eritz> people aren't going to be watching
[6:55] <eritz> so a floating fortress will not be unassailable
[6:55] <LuciferZ> http://livestream.com/blockcast
[6:55] <eritz> like i said, just takes a little creative thinking
[6:56] <liq3> "My enemies are stupid" isn't creative thinking. :p
[6:56] <vurtual> you know the dark visor in metroid prime 2, liq3?

[6:56] <liq3> vurtual: never played metroid.
[6:56] <vurtual> ok it's an item you get. If you hit a button, you can see otherwise invisible objects.
[6:56] <eritz> lens of truth, lol
[6:56] <liq3> eritz; that's a long list for moost internet folk. :P
[6:56] <vurtual> yeah basically
[6:57] <eritz> also, your lock idea reminds me of chrono trigger
[6:57] <liq3> vurtual: even better...
[6:57] <eritz> "A mysterious force seals it shut..."
[6:57] <liq3> make it so they see lava on the otherside of the door if they use it.
[6:57] <liq3> WHEN THERE'S REALLY NO LAVA.
[6:57] <eritz> also make it possible for there to actually be lava
[6:57] <vurtual> Except it made all the objects red, in grayscale, so anything hidden would glow brightly, as well as living creatures.
[6:57] <liq3> they'll be like "OH MY GOD LAVA, BETTER NOT OPEN IT."
[6:58] <LKA> lol thermal visor
[6:58] <vurtual> just solid red
[6:58] <liq3> should also make entering the wrong password open a trap door... that actually goes to lava.
[6:58] <vurtual> thermal visor would see heat in prime, that was different.

[7:00] <liq3> Also enchantments would be cool.
[7:00] <liq3> Poison-flame-ice-phantom-ghost-silver-sword FTW.
[7:00] <eritz> siege engines would be pretty badass
[7:00] <vurtual> Imagine having a whole ominous fortress, well-mixed into the natural environment, and completely inaccessable, since nobody can dig freely in the server.
[7:00] <eritz> but complicated
[7:00] <vurtual> And then guarding it with all sorts of advanced lua mods.
[7:00] <liq3> eritz: i think thinking you'd have to build em with blocks or something.
[7:00] <liq3> I dunno I just hope we get em.
[7:00] <eritz> you'd need a way to bind blocks together, so they act as one
[7:00] <EmpiresBane> i think that multiplayer survival would be good enough
[7:01] <vurtual> so unless people actually have whatever fancy gear/weapon/upgrade/tools you have, they see inaccessable walls.
[7:01] <EmpiresBane> there's all that epic shit going right now in singleplayer
[7:01] <eritz> it can get better
[7:01] <EmpiresBane> now imagine that x8
[7:01] <liq3> EmpiresBane: wait what epic shit? I am very confused. -_-
[7:01] <eritz> this game has infinite potential
[7:02] <EmpiresBane> liq3, have you not seen some of the things that have been made in infdev?
[7:02] <liq3> eritz: MINECRAFT IS SKYNET... OHHHHHH WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE.
[7:02] <liq3> EmpiresBane: i have not.
[7:02] <vurtual> Quickly, start writing lua for an armor item that you can further mod.
[7:02] <EmpiresBane> try searching the forums
[7:02] <liq3> I usually go afk from MC after every big update... Game can't grab me for very long.
[7:02] <eritz> god damn, this ubuntu iso is taking forever to download

[7:03] <EmpiresBane> yeah
[7:03] <EmpiresBane> idk
[7:03] <liq3> eritz: I don't like Linux. :(
[7:03] <liq3> It has terrible UI.
[7:03] <EmpiresBane> do you ever watch livestreams?
[7:03] <liq3> EmpiresBane: not MC ones.
[7:03] <eritz> linux is whatever the user is capable of shaping it into
[7:03] <EmpiresBane> the good ones have crazy stuff
[7:03] <eritz> that aside, i'm not actually installing ubuntu

[7:06] <liq3> EmpiresBane: the problem with building anything in MC is that there's isn't any real skill. :/
[7:06] <eritz> i beg to differ
[7:07] <liq3> And most of the stuff people are building is pretty borin.g
[7:07] <eritz> art skills are still skills

[7:46] <Yourself> i did?
[7:46] <Yourself> i don't even remember you
[7:46] <Visiiri> His lack of good sense of humor and understanding how a general social community works make him difficult to interact with, on many levels... and he ignored me :(

[7:46] <Yourself> or people with names
[7:47] <vede> I don't ever /ignore people.
[7:47] <vede> I just... ignore them.
[7:47] <EmpiresBane> it's also really awkward when someone is like "STFU!!" after you say something when they actually mean it to the person you ignored
[7:47] <vede> I just don't like being forced to see only half of a conversation.
[7:47] <Visiiri> I agree with vede, in this case.
[7:48] <EmpiresBane> i don't think anybody has ever ignored me...
[7:48] <EmpiresBane> at least, not on IRC
[7:48] <liq3> Yourself: lolololol i just found the reason. hahahah you can't take a joke.
[7:48] <Yourself> vede, it's the price you pay so you don't have to see people posting stupid links every 2 minutes

[7:49] <vede> I like the stupid links that pop up in IRC.
[7:49] <EmpiresBane> a couple people have muted e on XBox Live
[7:49] <vede> It makes it an adventure.
[7:49] <EmpiresBane> i have made it a rule of thumb to ignore youtube links unless people say really good things about it
[7:49] <vede> I impulsively click all links.

[7:59] <EmpiresBane> i think that's it.
[7:59] <vurtual> IRON MAN 2: BADDER AND MADDER
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> they're doing something Iron Man 2 related
[7:59] <liq3> EmpiresBane: says she doesn't know what it is.

[8:07] <EmpiresBane> Visiiri, that method is only rendering
[8:07] <liq3> EmpiresBane: you like logic/programming puzzles?
[8:07] <Visiiri> Yes, but are they animated when rendered?
[8:07] <EmpiresBane> idk...
[8:07] <Visiiri> :P
[8:07] <EmpiresBane> what do you mean animated?
[8:07] <Visiiri> Moving around?
[8:07] <Visiiri> well
[8:07] <Visiiri> arms and legs yaknow
[8:07] <Visiiri> animated.
[8:07] <liq3> EmpiresBane: LoG was ok until they started singing.
[8:07] <Visiiri> or is that in the spawn?
[8:07] <liq3> Then they became terrible.
[8:08] <EmpiresBane> yeah.... that is part of rendering
[8:08] <Firetempest> not much ai. see player. jump at it.
[8:08] <EmpiresBane> singing? what do you mean singing? what songs?
[8:08] <Visiiri> No, there's a lot more than this
[8:08] <liq3> "laid to rest"
[8:09] <liq3> And by singing I mean "screaming into the mic"
[8:09] <Visiiri> Sheep avoid jumping off cliffs
[8:09] <EmpiresBane> No.
[8:09] <Visiiri> and there's simply jumping
[8:09] <EmpiresBane> One of there best songs is Walk With Me in Hell
[8:09] <Firetempest> ive seen sheep and pigs dive off cliffs all the time
[8:09] <Visiiri> But they try to avoid doing so.
[8:09] <EmpiresBane> they try to avoid it, though

[8:10] <EmpiresBane> wait... liq3 is that YOUR opinion?
[8:10] <liq3> Yes.
[8:10] <liq3> :P

[8:10] <EmpiresBane> let me listen to Laid to Rest right now

[8:24] <EmpiresBane> or gay
[8:24] <PuyoDead> I really hope he doesn't think it's pronounced that way.
[8:25] <PuyoDead> In fact, it kind of reads like a gay lisp way to say the word gay.
[8:25] <liq3> So he's in fact gay?

[8:29] <Yourself> http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=188
[8:29] <Yourself> i've done that one
[8:30] <Yourself> ahh, here's the one i was thinking of
[8:30] <Yourself> http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=213
[8:30] <liq3> o.o.
[8:30] <liq3> You do math?
[8:31] <Yourself> yes, i do
[8:31] <Yourself> this problem reduces to matrix multiplication
[8:31] <liq3> Learning or you have a job?
[8:31] <EmpiresBane> oh.... i see...
[8:31] <Yourself> i'm a grad student in aerospace engineering
[8:31] <Yourself> math is a hobby
[8:31] <EmpiresBane> i could program something just to figure it out
[8:31] <EmpiresBane> but i'm too lazy
[8:31] <liq3> EmpiresBane: not brute force wise. :p
[8:32] <EmpiresBane> that's dumb
[8:32] <liq3> Pretty much all except the hardest are designed to be impossible to brute force.
[8:32] <liq3> erm, easiest*
[8:32] <liq3> The rule is "if it takes longer then 1 minute to compute, there's a better way"
[8:32] <EmpiresBane> that one can be brute forced
[8:32] <liq3> It can.
[8:32] <liq3> It'd probably take a week or longer on a super computer.
[8:33] <EmpiresBane> what? no
[8:33] <liq3> Which one? The one I linked or the flea one?
[8:33] <EmpiresBane> just run an ant simulation a bunch of times
[8:33] <EmpiresBane> the one you linked to
[8:33] <EmpiresBane> the flea one too
[8:33] <liq3> You clearly don't understand it?
[8:33] <Yourself> EmpiresBane, you have to get it accurate to 6 decimal places
[8:33] <Yourself> it would take an astronomical number of simulations to get that accuracy
[8:33] <EmpiresBane> ok... 6 decimal places would take awhile
[8:33] <liq3> Yeh...
[8:34] <liq3> Each step is close to 4^2 or something.
[8:34] <liq3> hrm
[8:34] <liq3> It'd be 4^s = steps.
[8:34] <liq3> Approximately.
[8:34] <liq3> erm, s = steps*
[8:35] <liq3> So just 10 stepts deep is 1,000,000+ possibilities.
[8:35] <liq3> And the ant probably goes 1000+ deep easily.

[8:45] <vurtual> it's not a boss
[8:45] <Marafk-17> and explorer.exe froze
[8:45] <vurtual> it's a generic enemy
[8:45] <vurtual> meant to hassle you for a moment
[8:45] <Marafk-17> and my hard disk is loud as hell
[8:45] <EmpiresBane> and it killed you?
[8:45] <vurtual> yep
[8:45] <Marafk-17> wtf

[8:46] <Marafk-17> yes, why
[8:46] <liq3> It's terribl.
[8:46] <Marafk-17> i'll see
[8:46] <vurtual> It's not "casual" enough for you marafk
[8:46] <liq3> I gave up on the second puzzle.
[8:46] <vurtual> It's very fun
[8:46] <vurtual> but also hard
[8:46] <vurtual> out-the-butts hard
[8:46] <vurtual> I beat it :D
[8:47] <Marafk-17> well, when explorer unfreezes
[8:47] <Marafk-17> meh, i'll kill it
[8:47] <liq3> It's "The-only-people-who-are-going-to-beat-this-are-people-who-spend-too-much-time-beating-SP-games" hard.
[8:47] <vurtual> not really
[8:47] <vurtual> It wasn't TOO hard
[8:47] <liq3> ...
[8:47] <vurtual> You just had to be really, really good at portal thinking
[8:47] <Marafk-17> sounds like logi-gun
[8:47] <vurtual> You know what'd be a fun program? A process murderer.
[8:47] <liq3> vurtual: the second puzzle was about reflexes, not portal thinking.
[8:47] <Marafk-17> LOL. hd stopped chainsawing and installer appeared
[8:48] <vurtual> It disguises as a process, then ends a random process, which is very flashy of a happening
[8:48] <liq3> Even after knowing how to beat it it, it still took 20 minutes.
[8:48] <Marafk-17> after damn 7 minutes
[8:48] <vurtual> then you have to figure out which process is process murderer.
[8:48] <liq3> And the method to beat it was ludicruosly abstract and not even in the main game.
[8:48] <Shadaez> you know what
[8:48] <Shadaez> I bet it's super easy
[8:48] <EmpiresBane> what are you guys talking about?
[8:48] <vurtual> Yes, yes it was, li.
[8:48] <Marafk-17> EmpiresBane: scroll up
[8:48] <vurtual> liq3
[8:48] <liq3> Portal: Prelude.
[8:48] <vurtual> It has its own ways of beating puzzles
[8:48] <Shadaez> liq3 probably also thought Braid was hard
[8:48] <EmpiresBane> Prelude?
[8:48] <vurtual> There are new concepts and challenges
[8:48] <Marafk-17> omg SPOILERS
[8:48] <vurtual> THAT IS WHY WE LIKE IT
[8:48] * Marafk-17 doesn't watch
[8:49] <vurtual> Because it isn't just portal: relaid out
[8:49] <liq3> EmpiresBane: mod.
[8:49] <Marafk-17> anyway, school time
[8:49] <Marafk-17> can't play now :(
[8:49] <vurtual> It's portal: new puzzle concepts, harder puzzles, new way of thinking.
[8:49] <vurtual> portal 2 itself took some ideas from it!
[8:49] <liq3> ...
[8:49] <liq3> vurtual: i remember this one alternate puzzle that was FUN.
[8:49] <liq3> :P
[8:50] <vurtual> So you suck at portal
[8:50] <vurtual> big deal
[8:50] <Shadaez> x1 agree

[12:54] <gdude2002|school> it will be epic
[12:54] <Naserve> I've beaten Penumbra Overture and Black Plague but I want more! I wish Requiem didn't suck so bad
[12:54] <gdude2002|school> lol.
[12:54] <Cintiq> penumbra is pretty cool
[12:54] <Cintiq> played it for about 10 mins
[12:54] <gdude2002|school> hah

[12:55] <Naserve> It has an awesome engine, an awesome story, and awesome puzzles
[12:55] <Zuggy> I just got done trying out Silent Hill: Homecoming.
[12:55] <Zuggy> God that game sucks.
[12:55] <Naserve> Only downside is the combat in Overture, but they fixed that in Black Plague
[12:55] <gdude2002|school> Horror games arne't my type.

[15:30] <Roadcrosser> i needa know what an attack angle is
[15:33] <Othilious> An Attack angle is the way you aproach your target I believe.
[15:34] <Othilious> So if you attack from above, straight down, your angle would 90 degrees from your original flightroute, assuming you were flying horizontaly
[15:34] <Othilious> might be mistaken though...
[15:34] <Othilious> would be 90 degrees*

[19:34] <TrueWolves`> ... Notch had a LOT of smilies in the older parts of his blog
[19:34] <TrueWolves`> The old water system was based on chance. Water tiles had a certain percentage chance of polling each game tick, so a single tile of water could take ages to spread.
[19:35] <TrueWolves`> This behavior is fine for more chaotic things like grass growth and fire spread, but water really should just rush in as soon as it can.
[19:35] <TrueWolves`> So I made it do so. :D (see video in next post)

[21:01] <Malikat> change the ratios
[21:01] <Malikat> make them match
[21:02] <Malikat> that will make rulering easier and probably make drawing itself more intuitive

[21:04] <ZomBuster> LuciferZ you can force the tablet to be the same ratio

[23:23] <Aexis> Not to spawn idle chatter, but I've never seen #minecraft this... quiet.
[23:24] <ZomBuster> there isn't much to discuss atm so we just are all in stand-by mode
[23:25] <Aexis> Well, as long as QK or LG don't need me to lock something
[23:25] <Aexis> I suppose I'll just idle, too...

[23:38] <LG_Legacy> Nope
[23:38] <LG_Legacy> We all died
[23:41] <vurtual> I was playing quake live, my firned coldn't join the match, and we were going to duel.
[23:41] <vurtual> instead, a random guy joined
[23:41] <vurtual> I beat him easily each time the round started, and he almost never actually started it.
[23:41] <vurtual> Eventually i just kept railgun-killing him, it was easier than quake 2 on hard.
[23:41] * Jon is now known as laCour
[23:43] <Aexis> LG, what decent IRC clients support pinging?
[23:44] <Aexis> I need something different than Mibbit
[23:46] <vurtual> mirc
[23:46] <vurtual> best client ever, hands down.
[23:46] * jonnyabc (Gian@c-69-142-216-55.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[23:47] <vurtual> unless you just use one network and one channel.
[23:47] <Aexis> I was thinking about getting that, but I read there was nagware in it after the 30-day registration period
[23:47] <vurtual> yeah
[23:47] <vurtual> you start it up, and have to wait a moment
[23:47] <vurtual> then, click continue, which de-grays out, and then wait a moment
[23:47] <vurtual> click continue
[23:47] <vurtual> and you only have to do that like, every time you re-start it. Which, it being an IRC client, shouldn't happen more than once a few months.
[23:48] <vurtual> you can just leave it to start up too, and then come back having to wait only a split second.
[23:48] <Aexis> So, it's not that bad?
[23:48] <vurtual> If you're so impatient that waiting a few extra seconds is killing you(aka toddler), then it can be annoying. If you're a sane human being, then it won't annoy you at all.
[23:48] <vurtual> Also, it can bug out and do this
[23:49] <Aexis> Right. And I would set pinging how?
[23:49] <vurtual> http://img6.imageshack.us/img6/9514/itsoverthreethousaaand.png
[23:49] <vurtual> pinging as in highlights?
[23:49] <vurtual> when someone says your name
[23:49] <Aexis> Yeah, as in it gets your attention when someone says something you set to be important.
[23:49] <vurtual> It's default for your name in the new versions, and a whole bunch of options for it in the options menu.
[23:50] <vurtual> and then if you are really, really that crazy about it, you can use the scripting to make whatever crazy function you need.
[23:50] <Aexis> What's this bug you showed a picture of?
[23:51] <Aexis> It just disconnects or something?
[23:52] <Quatroking_> hay
[23:53] <LG_Legacy> Aexis
[23:53] <Aexis> Hello.
[23:53] <LG_Legacy> I use a very old client
[23:53] <Aexis> Yes, LG?
[23:53] <LG_Legacy> :<
[23:53] <Aexis> Which is... what?
[23:53] * Quatroking_ is now known as Quatroking
[23:53] <LG_Legacy> ZRC. A irc ripped out of an application
[23:53] <LG_Legacy> Unfindable nowadays unless you download their program
[23:54] <Aexis> Hm.
[23:54] <Quatroking> So yeah
[23:54] <Quatroking> I just got the confirmation that I'm going to pass this schoolyear

[23:54] <vurtual> the amount of days used

[23:55] <vurtual> mirc opens it up in your browser
[23:56] <s10gah> Could somebody please help me? :)
[23:56] <vurtual> konversation opens it up in... a text editor.
[23:56] <vurtual> s10gah, ask your question first.
[23:56] <vurtual> Don't just sit there and pout since we haven't read your mind.
[23:56] <vurtual> We don't even know TO read your mind!
[23:56] <Aexis> I'll have to get that this weekend, I can't be bothered this week. Stupid 4th quarter projects.
[23:56] <s10gah> Sorry :P
[23:56] <vurtual> q4 2010 portal 2
[23:57] <Aexis> Konversation?
[23:57] <s10gah> How do i make a text, where it's standing: "Write /rules to read the rules", and when the user write that, he can read the rules
[23:57] <vurtual> s10gah, no custom server discussion
[23:58] <vurtual> and learn python
[23:58] <s10gah> Oh, sorry

[23:58] <vurtual> it is... buggy
[23:58] <vurtual> your hand is in a certain position, not touching input? CLOSE
[23:58] <CruelNoise> wat!
[23:58] <CruelNoise> #minecraft's birthday is the same as my birthday!!!
[23:58] <vurtual> CruelNoise, you are the present for #minecraft
[23:59] <vurtual> either that or it's your present.
[23:59] <Aexis> He has to get in the cake.
[23:59] <Yourself> aquaria is fun
[23:59] <Yourself> except for this level
[23:59] <CruelNoise> most of my enjoyment these days comes from here, so i think it's the latter
[23:59] <Firetempest> which one
[23:59] <vurtual> It depends on wether you're kidnapped and boxed up
[23:59] <Yourself> which is like "yeah, right before a boss you don't know how to kill, we're gonna make you go through a room that gets rid of 2/3 of your health
[23:59] <bildramer> guise
[23:59] <vurtual> or an anime-looking female arrives in a box to your house
[23:59] <vurtual> only time will tell
[23:59] <Firetempest> i didn't like sun temple too much
[23:59] <CruelNoise> an anime female
[23:59] <bildramer> <pekuja> well it's not a rumor that their video says "If we raise over $1,000,000 USD then Gish, Penumbra Overture, and Lugaru will release their source code!"
