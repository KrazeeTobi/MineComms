[0:10] <Firetempest> half hour to d/l them all, shesh
[0:10] <vurtual> dissapointed in you firetempest
[0:10] <vurtual> also I had this awesome idea what if there was a program that worked like steam, downloading things
[0:10] <vurtual> but for any file
[0:10] <Marach-14> disappointed*
[0:10] <Malikat> it always bugs me when things make you pay for only a certain amount of time of paid status
[0:11] <Marach-14> yeah :/
[0:11] <vurtual> Like, you put a url in, for a file
[0:11] <vurtual> and then it'll download it
[0:11] <Malikat> uh
[0:11] <vurtual> being able to pause and resume whenever
[0:11] <Malikat> so like a web browser?
[0:11] <Kizzycocoa> dropbox?
[0:11] <Marach-14> vurtual: jdownloader
[0:11] <vurtual> and then it'd update the files too.
[0:11] <vurtual> only downloading whatever neccessary
[0:11] <Firetempest> cant most torrent apps do that
[0:11] <vurtual> of course it'd require server/client support
[0:12] <Marach-14> jdownloader supports rapidshare, megauplaod and all that shit
[0:12] <Marach-14> it even cracks captchas iirc

[0:48] <Marach-14> Q: The music is garbled / I still don't hear any music eventhough it's turned on in the Options and I have no other programs running. What do I do? A: Try updating Windows Media Player, setting it to be the default music player, or updating your sound card drivers. If all else fails, you need to try the game on a different computer.

[1:53] <JacobR248> Emailed Notch about my problem, I don't know when he'll respond.
[1:53] <JacobR248> Hopefully I'll get an answer soon.
[1:54] <Malikat> what problem?
[1:54] <Malikat> ED?
[1:54] <JacobR248> The payment problem.
[1:54] <JacobR248> I wanted to buy thegame.
[1:54] <JacobR248> Tried using Paypal.
[1:54] <JacobR248> Went through their crap and at the end I can't use Paypal.
[1:54] <JacobR248> Hoping for a different payment option.
[1:54] <JacobR248> Maybe a direct payment.
[1:54] <vurtual> psst Iguana
[1:54] <JacobR248> Because I have a 50 dollar prepaid debit card.
[1:54] <Malikat> why don't you just use a debit card or a credit card
[1:54] <Iguana> ?
[1:54] <vurtual> I'm the one who nominated rape mode
[1:54] <vurtual> take that up with me
[1:54] <JacobR248> I did use a Debit card.
[1:55] <Iguana> >_>
[1:55] <JacobR248> Oh yeah.
[1:55] <Malikat> you know you can use that debit card without having a paypal account
[1:55] <JacobR248> I know.
[1:55] <vurtual> and your allergic reaction to originality.
[1:55] <Iguana> Rape isn't that funny. :/

[3:08] <whatdoesth> You're going to think it's a good idea no matter what anyone says.
[3:08] <Malikat> there's no skill involved

[3:08] <sorre> 'nuff said

[3:08] <vurtual> your games are all sorted in one spot :|

[3:10] <blaster> But any suggestions on adding more skill?
[3:10] <Malikat> blaster: that doesn't sound like skill
[3:10] <Malikat> you need to make character diversity

[3:10] * bombadil (madMonkey@S01060012172da1d3.wp.shawcable.net) Quit (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep)
[3:10] <Malikat> you need to give them some sort of way of personalizing their character
[3:10] <Iguana> I believe someone failed.
[3:10] <sorre> custom cover inserts specifically for those cases
[3:10] <vurtual> blaster, shuffling some cards
[3:10] <CruelNoise> what do universal game cases do?
[3:10] <vurtual> then drawing one, and using that to roll stats
[3:10] <blaster> Malikat its designed to be played quickly
[3:11] <Malikat> so that the decisions they make affect whether they will succeed
[3:11] <CruelNoise> what all can they hold?
[3:11] <blaster> Vurtual thats a good idea
[3:11] <vurtual> if it's within certain ranges you get bonuses
[3:11] <sorre> UGCs are cases that accomodate SNES, N64, genesis, and, with a little cutting, NES
[3:11] <Malikat> i don't mean like, personalizing at the start
[3:11] <vurtual> I can only imagine how many boxes we'd need if we had our old SNES and NES and had all our stuff together.
[3:11] <blaster> But incorperating stats into a card game is awkward, but I will try
[3:11] <Malikat> i mean like, have them get experience cards
[3:11] <blaster> And its still luck
[3:11] <sorre> well, lucky you, vurtual
[3:11] <vurtual> roll a 9, get a different result
[3:11] <Malikat> which they can use to upgrade their combat / puzzle abilities
[3:11] <sorre> UGCs come in denominations of 100
[3:11] <blaster> Malikat still lick
[3:11] <blaster> luck
[3:11] <vurtual> denominations?
[3:11] <vurtual> what?
[3:11] <blaster> and the puzzles require skill
[3:11] <Malikat> luck is fine
[3:11] <sorre> in other words, you buy them in boxes of 100
[3:11] <vurtual> How does it even work.
[3:12] <blaster> Malikat I need suggestions on decrecing luck and increasing skill
[3:12] <vurtual> How can it work with N64 games and discs!?
[3:12] <vurtual> and SNES carts!? Dreamcast discs!? HANDHEEELDS
[3:12] <CruelNoise> that's what i was wondering
[3:12] <vurtual> Okay probably not handhelds
[3:12] <sorre> hang on, i'll look for a more detailed pic
[3:12] <Malikat> okay, so each character class has certain abilities
[3:12] <CruelNoise> HANDHELDS
[3:12] <sorre> actually, for handhelds
[3:12] <vurtual> haundhealds
[3:12] <sorre> DS cases are recommended
[3:12] <Malikat> three for combat, three for puzzling
[3:12] <vurtual> I should just make a website
[3:13] <sorre> DS cases can hold DS and GBA games, and, with some retooling, can hold GB/GBC
[3:13] <vurtual> then have all my games listed on it
[3:13] <Malikat> when you succeed at a task, you get experience cards, which you can use to level up any of the abilities
[3:13] <vurtual> and a beaten status
[3:13] <sorre> and probably game gear
[3:13] <vurtual> Also I discovered something amazing recently
[3:13] <sorre> let me find some better images of UGCs
[3:13] <vurtual> There are 2 plugin sockets right next to my TV, which work for consoles
[3:13] <vurtual> well, they're useful for them
[3:13] <vurtual> If I set up my gamecube and n64, plug in the A/V cable and power cables, and then have them there
[3:14] <Malikat> like "i, the wizard, will use my 4 experience cards to improve fire spells by two, flight spells by one, and armour spells by one"
[3:14] <vurtual> Switchin between consoles is swapping the A/V connector for them.
[3:14] <vurtual> or, one plug
[3:14] <vurtual> I CAST RED ARMOR
[3:14] <vurtual> +100 armor
[3:14] <vurtual> I wonder if there's tabletop quake out there
[3:14] <Malikat> probably
[3:14] <sorre> this is a small pic, but it may answer your question http://www.racketboy.com/store/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/g/a/gamesusainc_2057_75611566.jpg

[3:15] <sorre> you essentially turn the N64 cart sideways, and it fits into a different set of pegs
[3:15] <blaster> Malikat, using anything but cards to keep track of stuff in a card game makes things awkward, and how does that realy improve skill, its still only selection
[3:15] <sorre> genesis carts work in a similar fashion
[3:15] <Malikat> because skill IS selection
[3:15] <vurtual> bonus fact: my video 3 connection=directly into thing, and then there's the video 2 which is my VHS thing that can have an extra plug

[3:15] <CruelNoise> has there ever been a repeat on "who's that pokemon?"
[3:15] <vurtual> So, if I had an extra power cord, I could have up to 3 consoles.
[3:15] <Malikat> card games are never really about skill, they're about making good or bad decisions based on the luck you have
[3:16] <vurtual> or up to 2 consoles on switch, meaning a gamecube and n64. Or have two of each, and pick two.
[3:16] <Yourself> strategery
[3:16] <Malikat> ^
[3:16] <blaster> I think character classes and skills will add too much compexity
[3:16] <vurtual> What about a D&D game, played using pokemon cards
[3:16] <vurtual> Pokemon D&D
[3:16] <Malikat> it's the difference between playing poker and playing war
[3:16] <Malikat> character classes are EASY
[3:16] <blaster> But I need to improve combat mechanics other than personwithhighestnumberwins
[3:16] <Malikat> you have character cards
[3:16] <vurtual> You have TCG battles using pokemon cards, but you actually go out and catch pokemon in dungeons, using items and money.

[3:17] <Malikat> skills are easy, you just place experience cards on the appropriate skills
[3:17] <LG_Legacy> Crab Battle
[3:17] <blaster> Malikat investing in skills adds alot of complexity
[3:17] <sorre> i'm actually almost out of my 100 cases
[3:17] <Malikat> that's the point
[3:17] <blaster> and it will require several new character classes
[3:17] <sorre> if i get many more cartridges, i'll need more
[3:17] <blaster> Oh i see
[3:17] <blaster> I will try and find a way without making it too complex then
[3:17] <vurtual> blaster, have "attacks"
[3:17] <vurtual> So, every once in a while, you get more.
[3:17] <blaster> But I will have a hard time balancing
[3:17] <vurtual> and then you have to immediately place them to weapon slots
[3:18] <blaster> Vurtual, thats too far
[3:18] <Malikat> yeah, that's too far
[3:18] <blaster> I was planning to have skills just be permanant items more or less
[3:18] <blaster> Like the spell levitation means you dont have to use a scroll of levitation
[3:18] <vurtual> so you could play your 8 of spades into your melee, being a black card you get an 8 edged attack
[3:18] <Malikat> you should pick your character's "attacks" or abilities at the beginning of the game, the character classes
[3:18] <vurtual> then when you use that in a battle, it goes away
[3:18] <blaster> Malikat I think it would be better to earn them over time
[3:19] <blaster> add em to treasure but can only be used by a certain class
[3:19] <vurtual> Well, diamond would be red/edged, spades black/edged, clubs black/impact, and hearts red/impact
[3:19] <Malikat> i like that
[3:19] <vurtual> red/black can do whatever you want

[3:19] <vurtual> based on what you're doing, black could be accurate(add to hit draw) and red powerful(hit draw adds damage)

[3:20] <Malikat> stop rambling
[3:20] <Malikat> fool
[3:20] <blaster> Malikat maby... like a sword can be used by a warrior or used to direct ligning away by placing it on the ground by a wizard
[3:20] <blaster> Or somethng
[3:20] <Malikat> that's a little too complex to be put into the rules
[3:20] <blaster> Good point
[3:20] <Malikat> it would be cool to let DMs allow that, though
[3:20] <vurtual> so your could have like, because you're a certain fighter, you can have 3 or so melee attacks ready, or whatever works. Then, you might want to consider playing a low red instead of a higher black, if you have a reason to get high hit chance draws.
[3:21] <blaster> How about you do end up with useless cards
[3:21] <blaster> Yeh I will add a rule called : if it makes sense to beat the obsticle using this, its ok to do so
[3:21] <vurtual> that's one of the first laws of tabletop gaming
[3:21] <vurtual> ever.
[3:21] <blaster> Like using a rock to dull the spikes on a trap
[3:21] <blaster> LOL
[3:21] <Malikat> that's the point of having a DM, otherwise the DM becomes and unpaid dealer
[3:21] <Malikat> an unpaid*
[3:21] <blaster> Yes, I was planning to add that from the begining
[3:22] <blaster> Also you can, in theory play with yourself
[3:22] <Malikat> rofl
[3:22] <blaster> since you never know what your gona get
[3:22] <vurtual> and certain classes from sourcebooks can have special class abilities that allow them to say, get really high hit chance, and high impact damage.
[3:22] <blaster> Whoops, phrased wrong
[3:22] <blaster> Vurtual this wont have sourcebooks
[3:22] <blaster> This is not a whole fucking rpg
[3:22] <sorre> most tabletop gamers are more than familiar with playing with themselves

[3:24] <vurtual> and then players will have to trade around to get the ideal set of attacks
[3:24] <Malikat> at the beginning of the game you pick your class, which has one inherent skill, and then get dealt one or two random skill cards
[3:24] <whatdoesth> If I wanted to play a tabletop RPG card game
[3:24] <whatdoesth> I would play Munchkin
[3:24] <Malikat> and to level, you place experience cards on or under the skill card
[3:24] <vurtual> and then there's a few classes, each getting their own benefits.

[3:25] <CruelNoise> TABLETOP CARD GAME?
[3:25] <CruelNoise> what's this?
[3:25] <blaster> At the start players can determine their character class. (Character classes undecided) and Skill cards added to treasure. Skill cards can only be used by one character class but you can have an unlimited number at once. They function like permanent items. Trading is encouraged between players.
[3:25] <whatdoesth> It's awful, don't worry about it...
[3:25] <blaster> Malikat thats too much info on 1 card
[3:25] * vurtual (vurtual@74.206.62.26) has joined #minecraft
[3:25] <blaster> and too many uses for each thing
[3:25] <vurtual> If I idly hover my hand over the touchpad in a certain way
[3:25] <vurtual> then hit some random key
[3:25] <vurtual> it closes my irc client
[3:25] <blaster> Remember EVERY TRAP will list possible ways of getting past it, and I dont want it to be a 3 page long list
[3:26] <CruelNoise> cool =D
[3:26] <Malikat> i don't think the trap should list every way of getting past
[3:26] <blaster> Key hit: click, Hand hovering so mouse is over the cross
[3:26] <Malikat> i think the traps should list weaknesses and strengths, or something
[3:26] <blaster> Malikat I will list the most obvious
[3:26] <vurtual> not that, blaster
[3:26] <Malikat> like general guidelines
[3:26] <blaster> Players can find other ways around it
[3:26] <vurtual> I can hit backspace and another key with my hand over the touchpad and bam, instant close

[4:04] <Trotskygrad> so... DO you think Minecraft ever will be PvP?
[4:04] <whatdoesth> Yes.
[4:04] <whatdoesth> Wasn't that the overall plan in the first place?
[4:05] <Trotskygrad> where did you see that, -.-
[4:05] <Jake> I was dreaming about PvP minecraft last night
[4:05] <Jake> it was brilliant
[4:05] <McC1oud> Team Fortress
[4:05] <Jake> was fighting in a flooded lake
[4:05] <McC1oud> no relation to the game
[4:05] <Jake> had to dig my way out
[4:05] <whatdoesth> I don't remember specifically, everything's been spread out, with Notch posting in different places.

[4:06] <EmpiresBane> you can do whatever you want
[4:06] <Trotskygrad> Player vs. Player
[4:06] <Jat> i know what pvp stands for
[4:06] <Trotskygrad> like you can shoot other people
[4:06] <Jat> but i thought notch said all along that survival will have that
[4:06] <Jat> did he change his mind?
[4:06] <Trotskygrad> I dunno
[4:06] <whatdoesth> No, Jat, I'm pretty sure he's said that all along too.
[4:06] <Trotskygrad> Most zombie survival games have FF off
[4:06] <Trotskygrad> methinks
[4:07] <EmpiresBane> are you saying you're wondering if players will be able to hurt eachother?
[4:07] <Dommys> CASUAL GARBAGE
[4:07] <whatdoesth> No, they don't.
[4:07] <Dommys> Fuck you. get in my way, Eat a bullet (arrow) .. lol
[4:07] <Trotskygrad> wat
[4:07] <Jat> minecraft is not a zombie survival game...
[4:07] <Dommys> It is now
[4:07] * Codlike__ is now known as Codlike
[4:07] <whatdoesth> Not even L4D has FF off, and it's... conceded a lot of things to make it easier.

[4:08] <Trotskygrad> not to mention
[4:08] <Trotskygrad> a bunch of other mods I can't think of right now
[4:08] <whatdoesth> Counter-strike doesn't have FF off... unless you're playing on a little baby server.
[4:08] <Trotskygrad> dude
[4:08] <Shadaez> FF is off by default in CS
[4:08] <Trotskygrad> like 90-100% of Zombie Mod servers for CS have FF Off
[4:09] <whatdoesth> Oh, zombie mod. I never played that.
[4:09] <Trotskygrad> Oh right, TF2 ZM, but TF2 dosen't have FF anyways, lulz
[4:09] <Dommys> Guarding my Fortress; Giant Eagle, and a Grizzly Bear. shit yeah
[4:09] <whatdoesth> Well TF2 wasn't balanced for it at all, so.
[4:10] <Trotskygrad> yathink?
[4:10] <Trotskygrad> anyways
[4:10] <whatdoesth> Anyway, it's not really the point since it's going to be actual PvP anyway.
[4:10] <Trotskygrad> you think Notch will add guns or any other ranged weapon to minecraft?
[4:10] <Jake> I hope not

[4:11] <Trotskygrad> it isn't even rendered as holding a bow and arrow right now
[4:11] <vurtual> but then two dark troopers appeared
[4:11] <vurtual> I got raped :(
[4:11] <Jake> I mean fits the theme
[4:11] <Jat> the pvp in survival is not zombie survival pvp it is YOU STOLE MY BREAD IM GONNA KILL YOU pvp
[4:12] <vurtual> how about we have a cannon that's small-ish
[4:12] <vurtual> and we take the wheels off it
[4:12] <Trotskygrad> I get the idea Jat... it's like Saveman pvp

[4:57] <vurtual> I dunno, there's a few out there
[4:57] <LG_Legacy> Derp
[4:57] <vurtual> And the player is a survivor of the dino destruction. Freeroaming and looting for supplies, maybe even holing up or running to a safer place. Combine tactical shooter elements, smart AI(raptors) combat, and an action shooter, where a lightened player is capible of extreme agility.
[4:58] <vurtual> grab an rpk and some ammo, maybe a knife, then sprint around gunning down dinosaurs!

You can do things like split water too, or hydroponics), pump water(or combine hydrogen and oxygen!), and build a power soruce
[5:29] <vurtual> fusion reactors, windmills(turbines is proper but stiiill), solar panels, water turbines.
[5:29] <Malikat> okay that actually sounds incredibly pimp
[5:30] <vurtual> The main addons for it are really high quality stuff too

[5:30] <vurtual> The addons are HUGE though, and the servers capible of handling them are known for crashing easily, or getting bugs where they'll be unjoinable/crash if someone joins.
[5:30] <vurtual> While building is really, really hard, if you can, it generally gives you lots of time to rework your fancy space station control, and to stop people from claiming planets too long.
[5:31] <vurtual> Combined with PHX and some tools, spacebuild enhancement project(huge amounts of starshippy parts and modules that make building big ships easy), and wiremod, you can make amazingly intricate spaceships
[5:31] <Malikat> okay so i forgot to turn my laptop off battery saving

[5:36] <vurtual> The upside, if the svn fails partway through, it fails on one file at most, so you just download all the ones not new.

[5:37] <vurtual> Anyways if you can handle the filesize, the fact that the maps are on the higher end of resource draining(a huge-ish half-mile in every direction, with a bunch of planets. Occlusion work is spotty)
[5:38] <vurtual> then it can be really fun sometimes
[5:38] <Malikat> only half a mile in every direction?
[5:38] <vurtual> malikat, hard engine limit
[5:38] <Malikat> engine is too hard
[5:38] <vurtual> but it's 3D space, so it's in every direction, so it's not too bad.
[5:38] <Rooster> Is resource mod complicated as wiremod?
[5:38] <Scrippy> What are we talking about?
[5:38] <vurtual> Spacebuild especially if you figure out building very reliable ships(people... often don't. If you do figure out the right moderation for everything you need, and build it well, it's awesome)
[5:39] <Malikat> space mode for garry's mod
[5:39] <vurtual> Rooster, yes and no
[5:39] <vurtual> technically it uses wiremod
[5:39] <Rooster> I don't really "get" Spacebuild
[5:39] <vurtual> however the simplest use is pretty easy, once you figure out how they changed it for sb3
[5:39] <Malikat> DAMNIT FORESTER HURRY UP
[5:39] <vurtual> RUN FORRESTER RUN
[5:39] <Rooster> Do you just build ships that fly?
[5:39] <vurtual> basically spacebuild is sandbox
[5:39] <Malikat> it's gonna suck if forester finishes and the map is fail
[5:39] <vurtual> but with things like resources and stuff, and has lots of content for building things made for it.
[5:39] <Malikat> wait, resources?
[5:40] <vurtual> So in short, space ships, space stations, interplanetary bases, battles in space.
[5:40] <Malikat> you need to collect resources to build? :3
[5:40] <vurtual> no, for air
[5:40] <Malikat> fuck that!
[5:40] <vurtual> build-resources mods generally suck
[5:40] <Rooster> What mod list do most servers have?
[5:40] <Rooster> Cause there is multiple versions
[5:40] <vurtual> phx3 and the main spacebuild 3 ones(all of them), wiremod, generally stargate
[5:40] <Rooster> Fuck wiremod
[5:40] <vurtual> you'll need the svn'd spacebuild 3 one(do not, even remotely, try to have a non-SVN version. It will be out of date by the time you download it.
[5:40] <Malikat> ...stargate?
[5:41] <vurtual> Malikat, stargates, stargate weapons
[5:41] <Rooster> I might as well just learn Lua, it's more productive
[5:41] <vurtual> wiremod's easy
[5:41] <Malikat> STARGAAAATE
[5:41] <Scrippy> Minecraft should have stargates.
[5:41] <Malikat> now you're thinking with portals
[5:41] <Scrippy> ...
[5:41] <Rooster> The cake is a spy
[5:41] <Scrippy> MINECRAFT SHOULD HAVE PORTALS.
[5:41] <Rooster> That spy is a cake
[5:41] <Malikat> that body is a spy!

[5:45] <vurtual> Had a guy who would cloak up to my base and shoot my reactor with a machine gun, and I aws always accross the room, near my gunship.
[5:46] <Azureangelic> obviously they weren't flying hard enough
[5:46] <vurtual> sbep shuttle+landing pad thingies and all sorts of fancy stuff on it.

[5:48] <vurtual> Also I remember having a vehicle that took like, a minute to assemble and charge, then it would go land on a planet and you could just take a few props off, and instantly get a biodome base.
[5:48] <Legolord> well, at least the docking stuffs
[5:49] <vurtual> Also a lambda-class shuttle
[5:49] <Legolord> Nice.
[5:49] <Rooster> This gamemode sounds fun
[5:49] <vurtual> which everybody loved and went crazy about
[5:49] <vurtual> it had no guns, just a few sparse tanks, and not-very-efficient fins that flopped out, which reacted worse with every duplicatino.
[5:49] <Legolord> I was only good with HUGE battleships and defense systems
[5:49] <vurtual> but I could fill it up in a moment with a winch, and then land it places and basically have a home.
[5:49] <vurtual> Or sit in it, drifting in space, listening to portal music, for ages.

[5:50] <Legolord> lawl.
[5:50] <Azureangelic> so it was like living in a camper van
[5:50] <Azureangelic> except it flew around in space
[5:50] <Legolord> were you able to walk around?
[5:50] <vurtual> and it was a giant lambda-class shuttle
[5:50] <vurtual> yeah Legolord
[5:50] <Legolord> niec
[5:50] <Silvertie> and it sounded like a relaxation vault.
[5:50] <Malikat> how do you make atmosphere?
[5:50] <Legolord> LOL
[5:50] <vurtual> except later versions which would flip over or vertically when you had the flight wings out
[5:50] <vurtual> you could walk aruond the whole time
[5:50] <Malikat> like, could you change a planet's atmosphere?
[5:50] <vurtual> now I want to play with spacebuild again
[5:50] <Legolord> THat reminds me of this one noob who asked me "How do I live in spase"
[5:51] <vurtual> Malikat, the maps already had the planets defined
[5:51] <Malikat> also was there zero gravity properly?
[5:51] <vurtual> yeah
[5:51] <Legolord> God, I will never have so much satisfaction in pwning someone
[5:51] <vurtual> not for everything, but yeah
[5:51] <Malikat> like freelancer 0g or homeworld 0g
[5:51] <vurtual> some objects act badly in space
[5:51] <Malikat> in freelancer you can completely forget which was was "down"
[5:51] <Legolord> oh god yes
[5:51] <vurtual> Malikat, there's still a z coord
[5:51] <Legolord> *@vurtual
[5:51] <Malikat> in homeworld, down was fixed
[5:52] <Legolord> I love homeworld!
[5:52] <vurtual> but if you don't build your ship with anything that'll use the z coord exclusively
[5:52] <Rooster> http://www.wolfire.com/humble
[5:52] <Malikat> yeah, but i mean.. could you rotate and then pitch?
[5:52] <vurtual> and you don't walk around, then you'll forget.
[5:52] <Rooster> Spread the joy
[5:52] <Legolord> but idk what freelancer is
[5:52] <vurtual> you physically construct ships out of physics objects, and seats that can be any angle, so yes, Malikat.
[5:52] <Silvertie> Space game, made by microsoft game studios, I think.
[5:52] <Malikat> woo!
[5:52] <vurtual> any angle or design is possible really.

[5:52] <Legolord> well, vurtual, not really.
[5:53] <Legolord> not ANY design is possible.
[5:53] <vurtual> Legolord, you can do Jango's ship.
[5:53] <vurtual> complete with 90 degree flip
[5:53] <Legolord> I saw one of those!
[5:53] <vurtual> or a spinning butt ship
[5:53] <Malikat> because in homeworld, the mechanics were great, but the movement was like.. you couldn't move on a relative horizontal for a ship, there was a set x/y that you had to move along
[5:53] <Legolord> You cannot make a ship bigger than the map.
[5:53] <Silvertie> Man. I really wish my local game servers had a spacebuild map, and I had GMod.
[5:53] <vurtual> I have, Legolord
[5:53] <vurtual> or a B-Wing, A-Wing, X-Wing, Y-Wing, V-Wing...

[5:57] <vurtual> and get banned for it maybe
[5:57] <Azureangelic> this is why gmod is amazing
[5:57] <Malikat> it's like the unf unf unf of anal sex
[5:57] <Legolord> damn.

[6:07] <vurtual> One version
[6:07] <EmpiresBane> still.... i don't see why it would take that long, Malikat
[6:08] <vurtual> Then, when you realise
[6:08] <vurtual> rename it
[6:08] <vurtual> then, keep working one a one-name dev version
[6:08] <Trotskygrad> I might just upload em all to my community's FTP

[6:08] <vurtual> how many versions?
[6:08] <vurtual> 50?

[6:28] <Animator> ATM, what is your gender?
[6:28] <ATM> Female
[6:29] <ATM> hai charr
[6:29] <Miclee> Obvious lie is obvious.
[6:29] <Animator> I don't believe you.
[6:29] <Animator> I can back up that claim.
[6:29] <LG_Legacy> Just like no one believes zuriki
[6:29] <vurtual> I can still taste that panino
[6:29] <ATM> i dont really care miclee

[6:30] <AndrewPH> trolling is a art
[6:30] <Miclee> You could've not come back at all.
[6:30] <Miclee> Would've suited me just fine.
[6:30] <ATM> but then i wouldnt have seen you
[6:30] <Miclee> Which is a good thing.
[6:31] <Animator> Stop the goddamned fighting.
[6:31] <Miclee> Now stop attempting to troll me, I've got better things to do.
[6:31] <LG_Legacy> Miclee
[6:31] <LG_Legacy> You're making it worse by responding to it.
[6:31] <Miclee> Good point.
[6:32] <LG_Legacy> See thats what people can't learn nowadays.
[6:32] <LG_Legacy> You have the power to stop a troll or conversation by stopping yourself.
[6:32] <LG_Legacy> Like forum posts.
[6:32] <LG_Legacy> Right Animator?
[6:32] <Miclee> I'm just multitasking, can't focus on one thing too much right now. Not thinking straight.
[6:32] <charrr> but I feed off lolz
[6:32] <Animator> LG is correct.
[6:32] <LG_Legacy> And i feed off banning idiots.

[6:37] <vurtual> Okay, which would be a better investment? Buying a faster connection(expensive, but useful), and building a server machine
[6:37] <EmpiresBane> it shouldn't be having that hard a time...

[6:39] <ATM> i hosted a map that was 1024x1024x128

[7:00] <LG_Legacy> I'm serious
[7:00] <Cial> i hate how people try to greif subtly

[7:01] <LG_Legacy> They do not censor the aliens
[7:01] <AndrewPH> Cial, then I go viking on their ass
[7:01] <AndrewPH> and hit them with ham
[7:01] <EmpiresBane> has youtube been slower for anyone else?
[7:01] <AndrewPH> youtube is slow

[7:02] <Azathoth> buffering....................... buffering
[7:03] <EmpiresBane> you get like 2 seconds of video for every 30 of buffering
[7:03] <AndrewPH> EmpiresBane, try a higher resolution
[7:03] <AndrewPH> it might be faster
[7:03] <EmpiresBane> what?
[7:03] <AndrewPH> like 480p
[7:03] <Naxza> Woot, I just beat Doom 3.
[7:03] <EmpiresBane> how does that make sense?
[7:04] <AndrewPH> hosted on a different server
[7:04] <Azathoth> why would a higher resolution be faster?
[7:04] <AndrewPH> Azathoth, read above
[7:04] <LuciferZ> NAxza, that game was so awesome to me when it first came out
[7:04] <Azathoth> oh
[7:04] <LuciferZ> And then last year I got it for xbox and beat it in one night and ruined my memories.
[7:04] <Azathoth> did you guys get the humble indie bundle?
[7:04] <EmpiresBane> that's right! youtube doesn't opperate on logic
[7:04] <AndrewPH> Azathoth, I'm gifting it to people
[7:05] <Azathoth> don't tell me you're buying it for 1 cent :|

[7:07] <EmpiresBane> damn ninjas...
[7:07] <Azathoth> so basically free unless you're a nice guy
[7:08] <LuciferZ> What the fuck Verizon FIOS
[7:08] <AndrewPH> I was a nice guy 3 times
[7:08] <Azathoth> they're not open source games though, so you wouldn't be interested vede :P
[7:08] <LuciferZ> <100 kbs
[7:08] <vede> I play Minecraft, Azathoth!
[7:08] <EmpiresBane> LuciferZ, i think that's the low end.
[7:08] <Azathoth> they're all cross platform indie games though
[7:09] <LuciferZ> It fills me with sadness
[7:09] <Azathoth> i love wolfire games even though i've never played any of their games
[7:09] <AndrewPH> vede, Here I'll give you one I just bought
[7:09] <vede> I think the only game in that that I'd care to have is Lugaru.
[7:09] <Azathoth> i got NS2 for half price from them a while back... plus i get overgrowth when it comes out
[7:10] <AndrewPH> i just linked you to all 5 deal w/ it
[7:10] <Azathoth> i'm glad i have an excuse to give aquaria a shot
[7:10] <Azathoth> i wouldn't have played it otherwise
[7:10] <Azathoth> it looks like a fun game, but it just looks... gay
[7:10] <Azathoth> :|
[7:11] <Naxza> Same could be said about Okami, but that's supposed to be really good.
[7:11] <EmpiresBane> aw shit
[7:11] <vede> Well, I guess I can get pissed off at Gish again.
[7:11] <Azathoth> world of goo is supposedly really good if you haven't played that yet

[7:15] <EmpiresBane> that's what i like in a game

[8:35] <ClassiestMedic> woot
[8:35] <outsomnia> Hay guise, who's looking forward to Diabo III?
[8:35] <Azathoth> i used ot play this really shitty MMOFPS called face of mankind or something
[8:36] <ClassiestMedic> we lava flooded a server
[8:36] <vurtual> then craft them ingame into the ability to order, free, an actual hat or tshirt or random object
[8:36] <Azathoth> it was bad, but i loved it anyway
[8:36] <ClassiestMedic> it's epicly lava'd
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> Face of Mankind sucks now
[8:36] <outsomnia> Now with microtransactions, DRM, and monthly subscriptions!
[8:36] <Azathoth> it's still around?
[8:36] <vurtual> "Where'd you get that hat? I grinded, for 6 hours, to get this."
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> It was cool at first
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> Bug now it just sucks
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> They want you to pay for shit
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> Like extra slots
[8:36] <Azathoth> lol
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> And leveling up
[8:36] <Naserve> They broke FoM? I played that like 4 years ago, it was awesome then
[8:36] <Speljohan__> welcome to modern mmorpg market vurtual, enjoy your stay!
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> You can't go past rank 3 or 4
[8:36] <Azathoth> i'm surprised there are other people who have heard of it
[8:36] <outsomnia> [21:36] <vurtual> "Where'd you get that hat? I grinded, for 6 hours, to get this."
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> Hell i don't think you can have a apartment now
[8:36] <Speljohan__> it's all so cookie-cutter it's ridiculous
[8:36] <outsomnia> TF2?
[8:36] <Azathoth> i didn't think it had a very big player base
[8:36] <LG_Legacy> Unless you pay
[8:36] <Speljohan__> everyone always end up being the exact same thing
[8:37] <outsomnia> ^
[8:37] <Speljohan__> grinding grinding grinding
[8:37] <LG_Legacy> I was a Rank 3
[8:37] <outsomnia> Dear god, this.
[8:37] <Azathoth> anyway i really miss that game
[8:37] <PuyoDead> Y'know, I still haven't noticed an increased drop rate in TF2.
[8:37] <LG_Legacy> It was actually a pretty cool game to be honest.
[8:37] <Azathoth> the combat was real shitty, but i liked the player controlled aspects of it
[8:37] <PuyoDead> I've found one thing since the last update.
[8:37] <Speljohan__> the whole concept of mmorpg's when they first came was to create virtual worlds
[8:37] <Speljohan__> not virtual arcade games
[8:37] <LG_Legacy> Tokyo was a war zone
[8:37] <Azathoth> dude yeah
[8:37] <Naserve> I played it when it was just on a monthly sub. I had a great economy and community, although the combat was total shit
[8:37] <LG_Legacy> And i had to stick to a FMC alot
[8:37] <Azathoth> i remember someone paid me to be a security guard or something once
[8:38] <LG_Legacy> They added a new level called Paris i believe.
[8:38] <Azathoth> because you could fight over territory or whatever
[8:38] <Azathoth> that was really fun
[8:38] <LG_Legacy> Yeah.
[8:38] <Speljohan__> proper player driven economy

[8:39] <Speljohan__> it's just a sign of bad game design
[8:39] <LG_Legacy> Yep
[8:39] <LG_Legacy> I recall just sitting in the cafe with my friend.
[8:39] <Azathoth> lugaru time nao. let's see if i can remember all 50 bajillion key combinations ><
[8:39] <LG_Legacy> This guy comes up and says something about he will be my waiter.

[9:34] <bildramer> 24 minutes -> insta-GTA feeling
[9:34] <Codlike_> nope
[9:34] <Naserve> A lot of games use the 1 second to 1 minutes system. The Sims always have
[9:35] <Codlike_> yeah
[9:35] <Codlike_> but Minecraft uses a 'tick' system

[9:35] <Codlike_> 20x20x60 or something
[9:36] <Codlike_> I dont remember
[9:36] <Codlike_> uh..
[9:36] <Codlike_> wait
[9:36] <Codlike_> 20 ticks a second, 60 seconds a minute and 20 minutes
[9:36] <Codlike_> so..
[9:36] <bildramer> wat

[12:26] <vede> "i would think to slowen lag is to eather make multoplayer survival severs or to make a map before the players enter" From a comment on the blog.
[12:27] <Bodie_> nice spelling
[12:27] <vede> Nice everything.
[12:27] <vede> That shit is just so perfect.
[12:27] <Malikat> ^
[12:27] <vede> Eloquent, precise, understandable.
[12:28] <Yourself> lol
[12:28] <Malikat> it's a perfect mixture of poor spelling and poor concepts, and poor everything
[12:28] <Yourself> either make servers or make maps
[12:28] <vede> Multoplayer servers.
[12:28] <vede> IT HAS MULTO PLAYERS
[12:28] <Yourself> sounds like a cereal
[12:28] <Malikat> oh god i didn't even see the o
[12:28] <Malikat> i thought it said multiplayer
[12:28] <Malikat> rofl
[12:28] <Malikat> it's not a server, it's a sever
[12:29] <vede> :P
[12:29] <vede> Yeah.
[12:29] <Malikat> multoplayer survival sever!!
[12:29] <vede> But what is it severing?
[12:29] <Malikat> multoplayers
[12:29] <vede> OH NOES
[12:29] <vede> Teh server severs all the multoplayers?
[12:29] <vede> DDDD:
[12:30] <Malikat> yes
[12:30] <Malikat> italian players beware
[12:30] <Speljohan_> not that bad vede
[12:30] <Speljohan_> i've probably mentioned this before here but
[12:30] <Speljohan_> we had one guy at a different community who spelled "appreciate" as "apricot"
[12:31] <vede> XD
[12:31] <Malikat> apricot!
[12:31] <Speljohan_> now THAT is fucking genius
[12:31] <Malikat> i love apricots
[12:31] <Yourself> oh look, more people who don't know that 56kbps is kilobits, not kilobytes
[12:31] <vede> id apricot if u cd giv me sum aprecat
[12:31] <Speljohan_> I APRICOT UR KONSRN
[12:32] <Speljohan_> i blame morons misusing the terms too much Yourself

[12:36] <Speljohan_> SANDBOXES ARE FOR NERDS, NOT CASUALS
[12:36] <vede> You think you could take all my folders and papers out of the computer so I can still have them when the power goes off? I think they're all just in My Documents.
[12:36] <LuciferZ> What? That statement makes no fucking sense, Speljohan
[12:36] <LuciferZ> Sandbox games are about as casual as games get
[12:36] <Speljohan_> ffa pvp/full loot is seldom considered casual LuciferZ
[12:37] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:37] <Bodie_> i'd consider minecraft a VERY casual game
[12:37] <vede> ^^ My grandpa actually asked me this.
[12:37] <Bodie_> you can't really be a hardcore minecraft player
[12:37] <Speljohan_> minecraft is not a mmorpg
[12:37] <LuciferZ> What is your example of a sandbox MMORPG, Speljohan?
[12:37] <Speljohan_> ultima online would be the best example
[12:38] <Speljohan_> and in modern days (despite being a boring game), i'd say darkfall

[12:38] <vede> I played through Lugaru.

[12:40] <vede> I spend an hour fighting the alpha wolf and dying, then I start again one more time, kick him up against a rock... dead.
[12:40] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:40] <Yourself> there sure are a lot of suggestions on the blog from people who clearly don't know jack shit about how computers work
[12:40] <vede> Apparently it was some kind of extremely deadly rock or something.
[12:40] <Speljohan_> i recently tried (and finished) VVVVVV
[12:40] <Speljohan_> was a very entertaining title
[12:40] <Marach-14> what did you expect Yourself

[12:40] <Marach-14> VVVVVV is nice
[12:40] <vede> Yourself, I think that happens everywhere on the internet.
[12:41] <Marach-14> if you liked it, try Hero Core
[12:41] <Yourself> true
[12:41] <Yourself> something about computers that makes people more willing to say something stupid
[12:41] <Marach-14> i've beaten it on all difficulty levels :3
[12:41] <Marach-14> each one has a different world map!
[12:41] <Speljohan_> i want iwbtg2
[12:41] <Speljohan_> :(
[12:41] <Yourself> like you can bet these people wouldn't try to give suggestions to their mechanic about how to fix cars
[12:42] <vede> "it should'nt b hard just programm the Windows 2 no when im trieing 2 copoy and then make it copy 4 me"
[12:42] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:42] <Marach-14> lol
[12:42] <vede> I love impersonating exaggeratedly stupid people.
[12:42] <Yourself> i've had people who honestly thought a website should offer more RAM for download
[12:42] <vede> Heh, yeah.
[12:43] <Speljohan_> i thought that too
[12:43] <Speljohan_> when i was 5...
[12:43] <Yourself> or that a regular LCD could be a touchscreen
[12:43] <vede> I've seen questions on the internet with people trying to figure out where they can download new RAM.
[12:43] <Yourself> LCD monitor, that is
[12:43] <Speljohan_> tho i do not blame them for their stupidity
[12:43] <Yourself> i do
[12:43] <Speljohan_> its just like how i wouldn't know dick about engines/vehicles
[12:43] <Yourself> yeah, but you don't broadcast that ignorance
[12:43] <Speljohan_> true
[12:44] <Yourself> you don't go into an auto shop and start saying stupid shit
[12:44] <vede> I figure they asked why something didn't work, someone said they need more RAM, so they just assumed that they could download it with the internet majick.
[12:44] <Yourself> or pulling things out of your car because you think they're unnecessary
[12:44] <Speljohan_> you don't go into a pc shop and start saying stupid shit either
[12:44] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:44] <Speljohan_> it's the interwebz
[12:44] <vede> Speljohan_, I think quite a few people do.
[12:44] <Speljohan_> home of stupidity and ignorance
[12:45] <Speljohan_> vede i've never heard about it
[12:45] <Yourself> you've never read those customer service encounters with stupid people?
[12:45] <Yourself> there's just something about computers that makes people assume they know something about them
[12:45] <Yourself> probably because they're magic
[12:46] <vede> Honestly, though, I prefer people who don't know shit to the people who don't know shit but who, because they use a computer a lot for playing WoW, assume they know everything that matters about computers.

[12:52] <Speljohan_> i have no intention of following other people's standards when i can write my own which i know inside out
[12:52] <Speljohan_> not relying on anything but the language itself!
[12:52] <Marach-14> Speljohan_: c++ is a standard too
[12:53] <Speljohan_> <Speljohan_> not relying on anything but the language itself!
[12:53] <Marach-14> you always have to learn
[12:53] <Yourself> OpenGL is a standard
[12:53] <Yourself> or DirectX if you're a masochist
[12:53] <Speljohan_> i am obviously talking about lower level shit
[12:53] <vede> And don't give a shit about intercompatibility.
[12:54] <Marach-14> lower level = shit
[12:55] <Speljohan_> i would say my limit is programming language + gfx library
[12:55] <Speljohan_> i wouldn't ever use any abstraction above that unless i wrote it myself
[12:55] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:55] <Marach-14> Speljohan_: including physics engine?
[12:55] <Speljohan_> yes
[12:55] <Marach-14> yeah, go write than one yourself
[12:55] <Yourself> have you ever finished anything?
[12:55] <Speljohan_> for that matter, i haven't ever required to use a physics engine

[13:33] <Notch> I just started feeling guilty about not being on irc more, hehe
[13:33] <Ruska> I have successfully installed gentoo
[13:33] <Snowman> You haven't been on here for ages
[13:33] <vede> The illegal character crash exploit thing has made hosting a vanilla server borderline impossible, Notch.
[13:33] <Speljohan_> sure, it makes development process slower, but it increases morale Notch !
[13:33] <Marach-14> Notch: and you were right
[13:33] <Notch> I know, vede.. I'm using that as an excuse for me to reach beta faster
[13:33] <Dommys> There is no work, there is only Zuul
[13:33] <Cat> We all are going to die now.
[13:33] <Adurah> Xul.
[13:34] <Marach-14> what exploit?
[13:34] <Dommys> Adurah, liar.
[13:34] <quaxar> Maart3h shh he is talking about racism
[13:34] <Notch> also, guess who's a millionaire in swedish krona now. =D
[13:34] <vede> Marach-14, there's some program that lets a person join a server and send an invalid character as chat, so all the clients crash.
[13:34] <Dommys> *Clap*
[13:34] <Marach-14> ah that?
[13:34] <Marach-14> it was always possible
[13:34] <vede> Yeah, except instead of being a rare occurrence, it happens constantly.
[13:34] <Marach-14> first time i saw it was in theone's lava
[13:35] <Cat> Notch, buy a cat.
[13:35] <Marach-14> when they made an irc chat with players
[13:35] <Speljohan_> and cook it
[13:35] <vede> I mean *constantly*, like of the six people who joined my server, six of them did that.
[13:35] <Notch> hehe, no cat!
[13:35] <Notch> i'm allergic!
[13:35] <Cat> Why not, cat is all you need...
[13:35] <Speljohan_> pets are an annoyance
[13:35] <Cat> you are?
[13:35] <Snowman> Real men use Euros
[13:35] <Cat> aw damn.
[13:35] <Speljohan_> you need to feed them
[13:35] <Marach-14> when they spotted it, they even made a /nuke command that does nothing else than crashes the clients
[13:35] * Cat jumps on Notch
[13:35] * Notch dies
[13:35] <Marach-14> but who normal hosts public servers
[13:36] <Snowman> AVM
[13:36] <vede> @_@
[13:36] <Marach-14> i asked who NORMAL
[13:36] * Roujo_ (Roujo@modemcable186.146-70-69.static.videotron.ca) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[13:36] <vede> CAT
[13:36] <Snowman> Vanilla servers are the best
[13:36] <vede> Bad!
[13:36] <Marach-14> Snowman: i agree
[13:36] <vede> Snowman, I know, right.
[13:36] * Roujo_ (Roujo@modemcable186.146-70-69.static.videotron.ca) has joined #minecraft
[13:36] <Snowman> I hate all that custom server crap
[13:36] <Marach-14> public != vanilla
[13:36] <Marach-14> me too
[13:36] <Snowman> Where you can't even place a full half-block
[13:36] <Speljohan_> blame bad developers
[13:36] <quaxar> Eh so far I like reloading infdev, clicking off the Screen to magicly float through the ceiling, quit and reload to float up more
[13:36] <Speljohan_> !
[13:36] <vede> 'S why I get all flustered when people are like "lol i can crash ur server u shud get a custom 1 lol default server suxxxxxxxxxx"
[13:37] <Snowman> Blame humanity's laziness
[13:37] <Speljohan_> lol vede
[13:37] <Marach-14> blame public servers
[13:37] <Adurah> Blame dumbasses.
[13:37] <Cat> blame lover
[13:37] <Speljohan_> brb writing a crash tool for custom servers
[13:37] <quaxar> I blame servers not being darknets
[13:37] <Cat> love*
[13:37] <Speljohan_> just to fuck them over
[13:37] <Marach-14> blame indle bundle
[13:37] <Snowman> Do it
[13:37] <Featherblade> Hey Notch, have you ever considered a ladder? (craftable object)
[13:37] <vede> Marach-14, you think the fact that it's a public server makes it okay or something?
[13:37] <quaxar> I blame blame itself
[13:37] <Cat> Speljohan_ use MCtunnel
[13:37] <Snowman> And then say it won't affect Vanilla :D
[13:38] <Marach-14> vede: public servers fail.
[13:38] <Speljohan_> i'm sure they have big overflow exploits
[13:38] <Snowman> Cat, we could do without people spreading that thing...
[13:38] <Speljohan_> most noobs who try to write servers rarely add any kind of flooding protection
[13:38] <quaxar> who is this "we" snowman
[13:38] <Snowman> The good part of the community
[13:38] <quaxar> a shadowy group of minecraft overseers?
[13:38] <quaxar> la lu le li lo?
[13:38] <Cat> <Snowman> The good part of the community < LOL
[13:38] <Marach-14> Notch: don't you think 5 save slots just isn't enough?
[13:39] <Notch> there will be more slots
[13:39] <vede> Oh yeah, Notch, you wouldn't happen to be accepting requests for that supah-seekrit beta thing would you? >.>
[13:39] <Marach-14> phew! thanks
[13:39] <Speljohan_> no he wouldn't
[13:39] <Speljohan_> otherwise he'd say so!
[13:39] <Notch> I'll invite people from here when I do!
[13:39] <quaxar> I think its enough for now, when we can respawn it will almost have no need to me to have more than 5
[13:39] <Notch> you're a likely candidate, vede. You're vocal, and have been around for a while
[13:39] <quaxar> I got people in microsoft to start playing minecraft
[13:39] <quaxar> They like it
[13:39] <Snowman> People say some people have already been invited, is it true?
[13:39] <Notch> hey cool
[13:39] <vede> Ossum.
[13:40] <vede> :D
[13:40] <Marach-14> Snowman: lol
[13:40] <Notch> that's not true
[13:40] <Snowman> Ok, now I know
[13:40] <Speljohan_> it's quite funnt
[13:40] <Speljohan_> funny*
[13:40] * Marach-14 is in #minecraft for quite long too :D
[13:40] <Yourself> <Snowman> People say some people have already been invited, is it true?
[13:40] <Speljohan_> i rarely play mc but i got stuck here anyway
[13:40] <Cat> troll'd
[13:40] <TW|LongGone> Notch, can I do my Final Project for my last year of non-college school on Minecraft and it's community?
[13:40] <Yourself> always figure Visirii or whatever for a liar
[13:40] <Adurah> It isn't community!
[13:40] <TW|LongGone> its*
[13:41] <Dommys> vede stop being so vocal.
[13:41] <vede> :(
[13:41] <Dommys> You keep waking my neighbors.
[13:41] <Marach-14> Notch: you just made me go back to my minecraft superproject
[13:41] <Featherblade> I have a link available to the minecraft forums for ladders if you want to see, notch.
[13:41] * vede mumbles quietly.
[13:41] <TW|LongGone> ... maybe I shouldn't ask, everyone is asking questions from you like usual...
[13:41] <TW|LongGone> heheh
[13:41] <Speljohan_> start coming here anonymously Notch please
[13:41] * TW|LongGone shouldn't even be here right now >.> <.<
[13:42] <Speljohan_> as soon as a wild Notch appears, the spam begins
[13:42] <Speljohan_> :/
[13:42] <TW|LongGone> Indeed
[13:42] <Featherblade> lol
[13:42] * Cat meow.
[13:42] <mnjiman> /hails notch because its the cool thing to do <@* here icecream for you Notch
[13:42] <Dommys> a wild notch appears
[13:42] <Snowman> He shoudl totally log in with Hcton
[13:42] <Marach-14> i think he got used to it
[13:42] <Dommys> IRC uses spam
[13:42] <Snowman> Nobody would expect that!
[13:42] <Dommys> It's super-effective!
[13:42] <Marach-14> mnjiman: 8th spacebarfail
[13:42] <vede> Speljohan_, if he comes here anonymously, I fear he might just abandon the channel...
[13:42] <quaxar> yeah, if you look at leo laportes IRC
[13:42] <quaxar> if he talks on there once
[13:42] <quaxar> lol
[13:42] <Dommys> I miss Leo
[13:42] <quaxar> Everyone goes crazy
[13:42] <Speljohan_> he should totally come under the name "bot3894762394"
[13:42] <TW|LongGone> Hcton, ha
[13:42] * Notch is now known as Anotchnymous
[13:42] <Speljohan_> !
[13:42] <Dommys> The corpse of Tech TV is rotting further every day.
[13:42] <TW|LongGone> ...
[13:42] <Dommys> lol
[13:42] <mnjiman> Notch, im vocal but im just vocal on the suggestion forum lol <3
[13:42] <TW|LongGone> XD
[13:43] <Speljohan_> good one
[13:43] <Featherblade> hehehe
[13:43] <mnjiman> lol
[13:43] <mnjiman> i saw nothing
[13:43] <Anotchnymous> the suggestion forum is crazy
[13:43] <Anotchnymous> when I read that, I lose all momentum
[13:43] <TW|LongGone> Best Game Developer ever.
[13:43] <Cat> on 1:JOIN:Notch:#Minecraft:{ /msg $chan SPAM SPAM SPAM }
[13:43] <Anotchnymous> I just go "no, that's bad" and "omg I have to do that" over and over
[13:43] <Featherblade> Ive added a lot of input in the sggestion area
[13:43] <Anotchnymous> there's a LOT of good stuff in there
[13:43] <Dommys> Like SPACE ? lol
[13:43] <Dommys> Or rapecraft.
[13:43] <TW|LongGone> Let the core ideas be implemented before the suggestions
[13:43] <Dommys> Hah...
[13:43] <Anotchnymous> yeah, tw
[13:44] <mnjiman> I think someone just needs to organize all the information on the forum into one solid check list of sorts,
[13:44] <Anotchnymous> it's hard, though.. there's so much potential
[13:44] <vede> I stopped reading the Suggestion forum long ago.
[13:44] <Marach-14> potential!
[13:44] <Snowman> There also is a lot of crap in the suggestions forum
[13:44] <Anotchnymous> i rarely read it.. It's like information overload
[13:44] <Marach-14> true
[13:44] <TW|LongGone> So do I have permission to do my Final Project on your game, imagionary company (unless you make a real one o.O) and community Notch?
[13:44] <vede> Oh look, someone else suggesting that same thing. Again.
[13:44] <Snowman> Same, It's jsut too much nowadays
[13:44] <vede> Oh hey, there it is again.
[13:44] <Anotchnymous> I've made a real company!
[13:45] <Anotchnymous> Mojang Specifications is a real, registered, tax-paying company. :D
[13:45] <vede> :O
[13:45] <Marach-14> aaargh, i have to make my map twice as big AGAIN.
[13:45] <Dommys> Yay
[13:45] <TW|LongGone> It's registered?
[13:45] <TW|LongGone> XD
[13:45] <Marach-14> damn minecraft
[13:45] <quaxar> I know one server is going to recreate earth
[13:45] <Snowman> Now hire some people and go beat EA
[13:45] <vede> The next step is to not become an evil monstrosity like EA or Microsoft.
[13:45] <TW|LongGone> Good think I used Mojang Specifications for the name of your company in the email then. XD
[13:45] <Cat> Notch why "Specifications" ?
[13:45] <quaxar> no matter how complicated
[13:45] <Anotchnymous> cat: Long story. :D
[13:45] <Cat> lol k
[13:45] <Anotchnymous> It's from back when rolf and I started Wurm Online
[13:45] <Anotchnymous> we needed a company name
[13:45] <Anotchnymous> actually, it's even earlier
[13:46] <Snowman> And it has a nice ring to it of course
[13:46] * TW|LongGone spent 10 minutes looking for Notch's Busniess card on the blog so he could find the company name, that's why he was unaware it was a real company
[13:46] <Anotchnymous> we were playing Eve Online and needed a company name. We made a silly logo and decided "Mojang" was nice.
[13:46] <Speljohan_> while(chan.getUserList().contains("Notch")) { try { input.sendMessage("/msg #minecraft HI NOTCH"); Thread.sleep(200); } catch(IOException e) { log.fatal("SHIT, LOST CONNECTION :("); } }
[13:46] <Speljohan_> one-liner code *shrugs*
[13:46] <Marach-14> Notch: is there a way to check my minecraft register date? i'm just curious
[13:46] <Dommys> Mmm 4x
[13:46] <quaxar> I have a company for when a person I know finishes a doodle jump clone for the iphone, he is going to let me reuse the engine
[13:46] <Anotchnymous> we wanted something like "Mojang Industries", but less clich?. Specifications was the perfect mix of silly and cool
[13:46] <quaxar> and use my art for the game
[13:46] <Dommys> Skip minecraft notch. Let's go to space! ;P
[13:46] <quaxar> Im making a parody of doodle jump called doodie jump
[13:46] <quaxar> turd jump etc
[13:47] <quaxar> Im horrible
[13:47] <Anotchnymous> I'm finishing minecraft.. But then I'm doing a space game :D
[13:47] <Speljohan_> spacecraft
[13:47] <Speljohan_> hurrrr
[13:47] <quaxar> Anotchnymous just like Blizzard
[13:47] <quaxar> lol
[13:47] <Anotchnymous> marach-14: Not yet, but I've got it saved in the db
[13:47] <Marach-14> ew, space game :(
[13:47] <TW|LongGone> <InsertNounHere>Craft
[13:47] <Dommys> Tell me when I can buy into the pre-beta of some Spacey goodness, k? :D
[13:47] <Anotchnymous> Hehe. Or Aphelion. :D
[13:47] <Marach-14> people want something unique! like minecraft is
[13:47] <Anotchnymous> yeah, I'll announce it on the blog
[13:47] * Dommys wonders if it will be named Spacecraft
[13:47] <Dommys> lol
[13:47] <quaxar> Marach-14 Space fishermen
[13:47] <Cat> Notch, whats up with Ez? i need her to make her join my "Females of Minecraft" project :D
[13:47] <Anotchnymous> I might try some alternative payment scheme, though.. Just to see what works or not
[13:47] <Speljohan_> it IS a good choice of name
[13:47] <Speljohan_> simply cus
[13:48] <Anotchnymous> but I'd make sure it was a fair model
[13:48] <Speljohan_> it's nich?
[13:48] <Featherblade> How far along is SMP anyway? weeks? months? undecided?
[13:48] <SMP> here already
[13:48] <Speljohan_> all games ending with "craft"
[13:48] <Speljohan_> etc
[13:48] <Snowman> What ever happened to tiny vikings in space?
[13:48] <Dommys> Something other than Paypal? for all the people coming in asking?
[13:48] <TW|LongGone> But yeah, I'll send the email of request as required for the project, other then that I shouldn't even be here right now, so byea!
[13:48] <Featherblade> lol
[13:48] <Anotchnymous> ez? I think she got bored with minecraft, hehe
[13:48] <Cat> aw damn it :P
[13:48] <Marach-14> paypal isn't bad
[13:48] <Featherblade> I meant survival multiplayer :D
[13:48] <SMP> i know
[13:48] <Marach-14> he knows
[13:48] <Cat> Wanna join Notch? be the first lady of MC:D
[13:48] <Dommys> Marach-14 not the point. some people just have critical complaints.. lol
[13:48] <Speljohan_> if you are selling shit it is Marach-14
[13:48] <Anotchnymous> MP is coming as soon as I get it to work
[13:49] <Malikat> oh hello
[13:49] <Anotchnymous> I'm a bit slow these days (much going on now), and it's hard work
[13:49] <Marach-14> Dommys: paypal just sucks the least
[13:49] <Speljohan_> u Malikat
[13:49] <Featherblade> ok
[13:49] <Dommys> Mali, you bastard.
[13:49] <TW|LongGone> Don't burn yourself out

[13:49] <Anotchnymous> I'm going to add alternatives to paypal sooner or later
[13:49] * Marach-14 wonders if Notch's got java at work
[13:49] <TW|LongGone> You do more then many other developers
[13:49] <Speljohan_> do it oldschool Anotchnymous, bankgiro with no internet support!
[13:49] * mnjiman (Mibbit@d24-57-104-173.home.cgocable.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:49] <Anotchnymous> I try, TW. =)
[13:49] <mnjiman> annnnd im back,
[13:49] <quaxar> Speljohan_ thats kinda risky
[13:50] <vede> Turn Minecraft into postcardware.
[13:50] <Speljohan_> but oh so awesome
[13:50] * Malikat waves at the internotchinal man of mystery
[13:50] <Speljohan_> and nostalgic
[13:50] <TW|LongGone> Who runs the forums?
[13:50] <quaxar> We need to create a manual internet with vaccumtubes
[13:50] <Speljohan_> nah vede beerware sounds better
[13:50] <quaxar> :|
[13:50] <Marach-14> TW|LongGone: aera
[13:50] <TW|LongGone> I have to send an email of request to both Notch and who ever runs the forums for the project...
[13:50] <vede> ... Yeah beerware would be better.
[13:50] <Marach-14> ^
[13:50] * Cat likes beerware
[13:50] <Snowman> Oh btw Notch, got my email on how to fix that scratch?
[13:51] <vede> TW|LongGone, try Animator.
[13:51] <Anotchnymous> yeah, I got several! =D
[13:51] <TW|LongGone> Also: way to make more money: Minecraft Calanders (complete with minecraft holidays, like Creeper's Birthday September 1st!)
[13:51] <Anotchnymous> But I decided to just ignore it. It's a battle scar!
[13:51] <mnjiman> lol.
[13:51] <Snowman> lol
[13:51] * Marach-14 is afraid Notch will have to do a mass convert of all online saves to mclevel format
[13:51] <TW|LongGone> Remeber the creeper!
[13:51] <quaxar> Minecraft should mock mass effect 2 with 15 dollar add ons like "SHEEP ARMOR, now the sheep can have armor"
[13:51] <quaxar> and "everything wears shades 5 dollars"
[13:51] * LordQuorad (LordQuorad@cpe-24-208-84-138.new.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[13:51] <vede> TW|LongGone, I'd go for Minecraft plushies before a calendar.
[13:51] <Malikat> i would buy sheep armour.
[13:51] <Speljohan_> that can't be very hard tho Marach-14
[13:51] <Anotchnymous> plushies need to happen!
[13:51] <TW|LongGone> Plushies are already planned
[13:51] <Snowman> Yeah, Creeper plushy would be win
[13:51] <Anotchnymous> it's freaking expensive, though
[13:51] <Marach-14> but time-consuming
[13:52] <TW|LongGone> This is another idea on top of plushies
[13:52] <LordQuorad> Creeper plushy ftw
[13:52] <Speljohan_> Marach-14, automation
[13:52] <vede> Minecraft swag is a necessity, Nawtchman.
[13:52] <Marach-14> i know
[13:52] <mnjiman> Lol! Thats Awesome. I think id buy a creeper plushy
[13:52] <Speljohan_> writing a tool to do it would probably take < 1 hour
[13:52] <Marach-14> but that's a load of files
[13:52] <Marach-14> UNLESS he'll delete all free account saves
[13:52] <Speljohan_> then you just run it for a a day or 2
[13:52] <Snowman> I'd pay like $25-50 for a creeper plushy, depeding on it's size
[13:52] <Anotchnymous> I'm dead set on not having any extra costs for ingame stuff with minecraft. It's part of the core idea to just do a plain old fair "single sale" type of game
[13:52] <Speljohan_> and bam
[13:52] <TW|LongGone> Becuase I would totaly buy a Minecraft Calander to put next to my Creeper plushie and then play Spleef on national Creeper Birthday.
[13:52] <Speljohan_> done
[13:52] <vede> I want some of those dice for car mirrors, but with grass blocks.
[13:52] <Anotchnymous> but plushies and stuff like that, sure :D
[13:52] <Speljohan_> you must make a franchise out of it Anotchnymous
[13:52] <Marach-14> FREE plushie for every premium!
[13:52] <Snowman> I want a lifesize one! :D
[13:52] <Cat> rana plushies?
[13:52] <Marach-14> rana :(
[13:52] <TW|LongGone> Rana blongs to Dock not Notch
[13:52] <Marach-14> R.I.P.
[13:53] <Cat> Rana <3
[13:53] <Anotchnymous> ask Dock about rana. :)
[13:53] <Anotchnymous> it's his model
[13:53] <Marach-14> where? #tigirc ?

[13:53] <Ruska> minecraft needs a 25$ horse mount
[13:53] <Anotchnymous> he's on there now, yes
[13:53] <Cat> yeah, but some of us miss her
[13:53] <Marach-14> oh wow
[13:53] <quaxar> I was not serious, I just know that DLC is a horrible idea and most games that have DLC are pretty much "your pet has armor" or "everyone now wears shades"
[13:53] <TW|LongGone> I want to Car-dice only as the minecraft Sun and Moon Notch, =D
[13:53] <vede> Make a deal with McDonald's!
[13:53] <Anotchnymous> haha ruska
[13:53] <vede> Minecraft toy with every Kids' Meal!
[13:53] <mnjiman> Lol Ruska
[13:53] <Speljohan_> dlc's are a disgrace to gaming
[13:53] <Speljohan_> death to paying for additional content!
[13:53] <Anotchnymous> I'm considering doing some kind of micropayment thing with the space game, possibly.. If I can make it feel fair
[13:53] <Malikat> vede: fully functional creeper toys in every extra value meal
[13:54] <TW|LongGone> ...
[13:54] <vede> :o
[13:54] <Anotchnymous> I want that game to have some online features that require central servers
[13:54] <Malikat> blow the weight away!
[13:54] <TW|LongGone> Functional?
[13:54] <Snowman> What about 5 more maps for $15?
[13:54] <Snowman> :3
[13:54] <quaxar> I think paying for the idea of random parts of the world being player generated would be fine
[13:54] <vede> Plastic creeper toy with a slot for an M-80.
[13:54] <Speljohan_> do NOT have a micro-payment system where you can buy advantages Anotchnymous :/
[13:54] <Speljohan_> it's like
[13:54] <Speljohan_> the biggest scam ever
[13:54] <Anotchnymous> yeah, agreed, speljohan
[13:54] <Marach-14> wow, tigirc has a minecraft server
[13:54] <TW|LongGone> Also, DLC is not a bad thing when the 20$ download is worth a 20$ worth of a whole video games add on, 5$ so everyone has shades or 15$ for pet armor are horrable DLC... as are most DLC
[13:55] <Speljohan_> :)
[13:55] <TW|LongGone> If the DLC could be it's own small game, it's good.
[13:55] <mnjiman> i played a game like that speljohan_
[13:55] <TW|LongGone> also, micro-payment for advantages suck
[13:55] <Anotchnymous> dlc for stuff ALREADY ON THE DISC is the biggest scam ever. ;)
[13:55] <Speljohan_> cosmetic things are alright for micro-payments
[13:55] * Flesh (SERVING@109.255.20.80) has joined #minecraft
[13:55] <Speljohan_> nothing i'd buy tho
[13:55] <TW|LongGone> 100% agreed!
[13:55] <mnjiman> i did pay some, but i realized how stupid it was
[13:55] <vede> I don't like games being split up into little parts and sold separately, even if the DLC is just expansions or something.
[13:55] <TW|LongGone> If it's ON THE DAMN DISK and I BOUGHT THE DISK
[13:55] <Speljohan_> same vede
[13:55] <TW|LongGone> IT IS MINE
[13:55] <vede> I prefer for the game to be a single package, no assembly required.
[13:56] <Anotchnymous> yeah
[13:56] <LordQuorad> yes
[13:56] <Snowman> Back in my day, we called DLC expansion packs :/
[13:56] <Speljohan_> if i pay for a game i expect all of the content
[13:56] <Anotchnymous> perhaps I should just go for a monthly fee for online features of the space game
[13:56] <LordQuorad> lol
[13:56] <Speljohan_> Snowman, and expansion packs were big
[13:56] <LordQuorad> very.
[13:56] <Anotchnymous> so single sale for singleplayer, then monthly fee for the online parts
[13:56] <Speljohan_> not small add-ons
[13:56] <TW|LongGone> The game and any download content (Which should be downloaded not on the disk) should all be able to function as there own games like true expansion packs
[13:56] <TW|LongGone> anything else sucks
[13:56] <vede> What kind of game will it be, Anotchnymous?
[13:56] <Speljohan_> that's a good plan Anotchnymous
[13:56] <Malikat> Anotchnymous: you are going to go from successful indie dev to indie tycoon?
[13:56] <Anotchnymous> space trading sim Done Right(tm)
[13:56] <LordQuorad> Can we get some more crafting options in indev? I would like that.
[13:56] <Speljohan_> awesome
[13:56] <Snowman> Imagine EVE online ;)
[13:56] <Anotchnymous> I will try!
[13:57] <Rithiur> Anotchnymous: Don't get too distracted from minecraft now!
[13:57] <quaxar> Imagine eve online, but with pigs and sheep
[13:57] <vede> Done Right?
[13:57] <Cat> <@Anotchnymous> perhaps I should just go for a monthly fee for online features of the space game < Troll'd
[13:57] <Malikat> oh god!
[13:57] <Anotchnymous> I'm saving up money so I can do at least one more game after minecraft
[13:57] <Speljohan_> i hope you are sticking to java Anotchnymous
[13:57] <Malikat> Pigs! In! Space!
[13:57] <Speljohan_> java games need more attention on the market
[13:57] <Speljohan_> and way more recognition as a fully functional language
[13:57] <Anotchnymous> that depends on what oracle does with java
[13:57] <Snowman> Saving money, but still you buy 4 monitors :P
[13:57] <vede> What is Done Right, Anotchnymous?
[13:57] <Speljohan_> clear up some misconceptions etc
[13:57] <Anotchnymous> yes, haha
[13:57] <Anotchnymous> that four monitor thing was totally pointless
[13:57] <TW|LongGone> The only other guys that give Java as much attention as Notch does is Jatex... and all their games have monthly fees -.-
[13:57] <Anotchnymous> I just HAD to spend
[13:57] <Dommys> Who DOESN'T need 4 monitors?
[13:57] <Snowman> Do you also have 3 mice and 2 keyboards?
[13:57] <Dommys> REALLY
[13:57] <Speljohan_> jagex is mad though TW|LongGone
[13:58] <Anotchnymous> I think three monitors is perfect, actually
[13:58] <Speljohan_> if there's anything i admire in java it's their systems
[13:58] <Anotchnymous> on center one, and two spare
[13:58] <quaxar> I am going to buy the novint falcon and play minecraft with it
[13:58] <Anotchnymous> I don't use the fourth one much at all..

[13:58] <quaxar> no more WASD once I buy that hopefully
[13:58] <Dommys> Notch, you can do that with Eyefinity, and then run the fourth seperate just for IRC/Twhirl ;P
[13:58] <Malikat> you need to mount the fourth one above the center
[13:58] <TW|LongGone> Jagex has done a good job but all their games have monthy fees, they are also paranoided as hell (Which that and the crap community really ruins their stuff)
[13:58] <Snowman> :O
[13:58] <vede> I'm pretty much okay with just one monitor.
[13:58] <Snowman> His boss found out :P
[13:58] <Speljohan_> they have the absolutely most awesome java systems in history though Rithiur
[13:58] <Speljohan_> it's ridiculous how epic they are
[13:59] <Rithiur> Speljohan_: Yeah, I admire the talent but wonder what the hell is going through their minds :P
[13:59] <vede> But I'm sure I could find a use for a second one if I had it.
[13:59] <TW|LongGone> They are paranoided as hell though
[13:59] <Speljohan_> all in-house written stuff
[13:59] <Snowman> 2 Monitors is the best thing, 3 is a bit TOO much imho
[13:59] <Speljohan_> including their web server software
[13:59] <Dommys> Snowman, you aren't familiar with Eyefinity?
[13:59] <Speljohan_> and their fucking web server software must be the most efficient one in existance
[13:59] <quaxar> 4 moniters makes sense when programming, chatting and browsing the internet at the same time
[13:59] * TW|LongGone sticks to his one monitor and computer that runs indev at 9fps, he can't buy anything else for a while.
[13:59] <quaxar> but it is not that amazing
[13:59] <Speljohan_> they run their webserver handling forums on 512mb ram and a p4
[13:59] <quaxar> sinc eyou have to pay attention to one thing at a time still
[13:59] <Speljohan_> and it's one of the biggest forums on the web
[13:59] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:00] <Snowman> If only their games sucked less
[14:00] <Speljohan_> i don't care about their games
[14:00] <Speljohan_> i care about their technology
[14:00] <Featherblade> Any ideas for new enemies, specifically original ones? (like the creeper.)
[14:00] <TW|LongGone> Their games are awesome, ruined by 2 major things: Their extream paranoia, and their crap-tastic community
[14:00] <quaxar> I want to recreate stalker on miencraft
[14:00] <quaxar> MEINKRAFFT
[14:00] <Rithiur> Speljohan_: Yeah. Runescape is shitty game, even though the engine may be brilliant :P
[14:00] <Speljohan_> lool quaxar
[14:00] <TW|LongGone> September First, Day of the Creeper!
[14:00] <TW|LongGone> Becuase that was when creepers were announced, =D
[14:00] <Speljohan_> they have another layer above the engine Rithiur
[14:01] <Speljohan_> eg
[14:01] <Speljohan_> above the java vm they have their own vm
[14:01] <Speljohan_> with specific instructions for their engine
[14:01] <Speljohan_> !
[14:01] <mnjiman> i played RS for a bit.. but the graphics were just awful at all in every aspect,
[14:01] <TW|LongGone> Let's talk about minecraft eh?
[14:01] <LordQuorad> @Featherblade I would like a witch that turns to water when killed.
[14:01] <mnjiman> Minecraft have better graphics
[14:01] <quaxar> I wish footsteeps were squeeks
[14:01] <mnjiman> DF has better graphics too
[14:01] <vede> It would be so easy to make a Roadside Picnic style game out of Minecraft, it's almost frustrating.
[14:01] <quaxar> on a certaintype of floor
[14:01] <TW|LongGone> mnjiman, they've improved these last 3 years a ton.
[14:01] <Featherblade> a witch?
[14:01] <LordQuorad> For the lulz?
[14:02] <TW|LongGone> a water spawning block
[14:02] <LordQuorad> You wanted original, I just came up with that.
[14:02] <TW|LongGone> that floods your whole map
[14:02] <Featherblade> hmmm
[14:02] <TW|LongGone> though an ememy that drops a water block would be intresting
[14:02] <LordQuorad> But in all seriousness, I would like complete crafting options before new enemies.
[14:02] <Speljohan_> i am off home
[14:02] <LordQuorad> Such as brick and bookcases recipes.
[14:02] <Rithiur> Minecraft needs a way to rise water at least. Pumps or water spawning blocks would be nice.

[14:03] <Featherblade> i would like buckets next :)
[14:03] <Dommys> "xnotch Oh, I guess the trial of ircle ran out. :D"
[14:03] <LordQuorad> buckets!
[14:03] <quaxar> Notch said buckets
[14:03] <TW|LongGone> It needs water physics first, so one step at a time.
[14:03] <LordQuorad> yeah.
[14:03] <quaxar> Um he is just going to make the physics simple
[14:03] <Rithiur> TW|LongGone: True that.
[14:03] <LordQuorad> Gears are cool, but they need a function
[14:03] <Malikat> too bad notch can't afford to buy another IRC client
[14:03] <quaxar> not realistic
[14:03] <LordQuorad> maybe a porticullis
[14:03] <quaxar> its going to be simple physics
[14:03] <quaxar> ie, water falls
[14:03] <Rithiur> Or at leaset some expanding/flowing water in infdev would be a start :P
[14:03] <Featherblade> not really, if you have buckets , you can move water where you like.
[14:03] <Snowman> Why doesn't he just use Mibbit?
[14:03] <TW|LongGone> quaxar, that may be true, but they need to be before any of this other stuff.
[14:04] <TW|LongGone> Right now water is deletable in infdev with out coming back, 3=
[14:04] <LordQuorad> mossy stone needs to be implimented in the same way grass grows.
[14:04] <TW|LongGone> Though it makes for awesome water-sculpting
[14:04] <quaxar> water spawns more water when its fixed
[14:04] <quaxar> But it wont be realistic like on indev
[14:04] <TW|LongGone> It's not fixed yet though, that's the point

[14:05] <quaxar> Well multiplayer is the priority
[14:05] <LordQuorad> What about repairing armor?

[14:05] <LordQuorad> Hammer?
[14:05] <quaxar> with multiplayer before thats fixed
[14:05] <TW|LongGone> Armor needs to not degrade at the same speed for all types of armor
[14:05] <TW|LongGone> it makes making diamond armor pointless
[14:05] <Featherblade> The real problem in infdev is determining infinite water.

[14:19] <Dommys> I would still have need for NBT
[14:19] <Dommys> Endless sources of TNT keep me entertained.
[14:19] <quaxar> nbt would be good for importing multiple indev maps into infdec

[14:19] <quaxar> into one consolidated world
[14:19] <Dommys> My waterhead jiggles gleefully when things go "poof"

[14:20] <LordQuorad> someday.
[14:21] <LordQuorad> Hey
[14:21] <LordQuorad> what about combining bread and meat to get a sandwich?
[14:21] <LordQuorad> full health restore anyone?
[14:21] <LordQuorad> or 75%
[14:22] <Dommys> I'd rather have something else.
[14:22] <quaxar> Set difficulty to peaceful and act like you did that
[14:22] <Dommys> Like, Red mushroom and meat and bowl = soup that makes you run faster for awhile, but does damage.
[14:23] <Dommys> Brown Mushrooms and meat and bowl makes soup that makes you run slower, but regen health for a duration
[14:24] <TW|LongGone> so, curry and over-filling soup?
[14:24] <Dommys> Sure
[14:24] <TW|LongGone> ... both which sound like a good snack right now...
[14:24] * TW|LongGone disapears again
[14:24] <Dommys> I mean, really though..
[14:24] <Dommys> Those two things could add a huge level of depth to PVP

[14:25] <TW|LongGone> Though I still like the ideas
[14:25] <LordQuorad> I would like a higher level difficulty mode. I want the creeper hoarde to lay siege to my fort.
[14:25] <Dommys> lol
[14:25] <Dommys> I think Spawn Multiplier should be an option
[14:25] <LordQuorad> 10x
[14:25] <Dommys> So you stick to the same difficulties, but you can 100x if you want to die quick

[14:53] <Marach-14> when i move it up, i want to look up
[14:54] <vede> I like mouse inversion for vehicles. For some strange reason.
[14:54] <Marach-14> in minecraft?
[14:54] <vede> What? No.
[14:54] <TW|LongGone> I perfer inversion for Air-based movement, but not for general looking around

[17:47] <vurtual> I've made an unorthodox spaceship in garry's mod. So far this shape has worked perfectly.
[17:48] <vurtual> it's shaped like an arrow, with two floors. The upper one just has an engine and pilot's seat, is shorter on both amounts, and basically sits on top. The lower one has an entrance on back, a mannable turret on front(facing down-forward), and then two curving-back engine parts.
[17:50] <vurtual> this is apparently a very efficient design.

[18:11] <FireRat> dan git...
[18:11] <Jake> FireRat: the only was to control water in infdev is to hack your save file so you have water in your inventory. Then you can lay water around
[18:11] <Jake> it still wont flow though
[18:11] <Codlike> I believe it's Implied he broke it to avoid unnecessary disk usage during Notch's tests
[18:11] <FireRat> A goblin blew up in the water and its all gone now I can't put crops ...
[18:12] <Codlike> imagine if water fell through the 'solid' blocks?
[18:12] <vurtual> It's not "broken"
[18:12] <vurtual> Water flowing is off.
[18:12] <vurtual> Also there are no goblins FireRat.

[19:52] <CruelNoise> elaborate
[19:52] <Kizzycocoa> well, I thought, as we have different skin mods, maps, server stuff etc, why not make a moddb entry?
[19:53] <CruelNoise> they aren't really mods
[19:54] <Kizzycocoa> moddb is also home to games and indie games
[19:54] <CruelNoise> hm
[19:54] <Snowman> Notch was here today
[19:54] <CruelNoise> well, have you tried emailing, or memoserving him?

[19:54] <Kizzycocoa> memoserving?
[19:55] <CruelNoise> go to esper.net net and look at help

[19:59] <Snowman> Kids nowadays, doing projects on video games :/
[19:59] <CruelNoise> also, i don't think there's a need for the apostraphe in 'it's'

[20:00] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> "Mojang Specifications" =D
[20:00] <CruelNoise> isn't that the company he did worm with?
[20:00] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Yes
[20:00] <CruelNoise> oh, wurm
[20:00] <CruelNoise> but minecraft is still technicall mojang?
[20:00] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> It's Notch's (and maybe his friends too, not 100% sure) company
[20:01] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Mojang = Notch's company
[20:01] <CruelNoise> ok
[20:01] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Acording to him this morning at least
[20:01] <CruelNoise> cool
[20:02] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> I have to write an e-mail or letter to Notch and also the person who runs the forums, that's Animator right?
[20:02] <Marach-14> not aera?
[20:02] <CruelNoise> i thnk EZ has the ultimate say
[20:02] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Hm...
[20:02] <Marach-14> Mojang Specifications
[20:02] <Snowman> No
[20:02] <Marach-14> the full name
[20:02] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Pin pointing who runs the forums hasn't been easy...
[20:02] <Snowman> Citric and aera run the forums
[20:02] <Marach-14> i'd believe Snowman
[20:02] <CruelNoise> whatever, then
[20:02] <CruelNoise> yeah, he's old
[20:03] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Alright, should I email one of them or them both?
[20:03] <Snowman> I'd get citric
[20:03] <Snowman> He runs them, aera bscly just hosts them
[20:03] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Snowman is almost as old as a community member as I am and has contributed more, so yeah I trust em for information.
[20:03] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> ... a lot more
[20:03] * TrueWolves|SchoolProject just needs to get citric's email... shouldn't be to hard
[20:04] <CruelNoise> no, i meant age-old
[20:04] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> I know what you meant. =P
[20:04] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> I don't think Snowman is past his 20s though at least.
[20:04] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Which isn't "old" it's "Mature"
[20:04] <Snowman> You can go to citric's account on the forums and just press email there
[20:04] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Thanks Snowman
[20:05] <Snowman> Or look for his account on the TOL but I'm not sure if he's on there
[20:05] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> He has an acount on newgrounds too I think.
[20:05] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> And in a few other places (maybe)
[20:05] <Snowman> Nope, he ain't on the TOL

[20:06] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Anyone here willing to be interviewed and willing to fill out a quick servey as well? I'll be getting people who are IRC-only, forum-only, and both-ways as well as people that contribue elsewhere like the wiki
[20:06] <Snowman> How long does it take?
[20:06] <CruelNoise> YEAH
[20:06] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> That won't be today, but later this week or next week.
[20:06] <CruelNoise> i've always wanted to do that sort of thing =D
[20:06] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> It'll take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour if the interview is going really well, I haven't written it yet becuase I'm not at that step in my plans yet.
[20:07] <Snowman> I'll see if I got time
[20:07] <CruelNoise> when will it be ready?
[20:07] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> My teacher laughed at the address to my letter being "Somewhere in Stockholm, Sweden" and just gave me permission to write an email instead... heh.
[20:07] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Next week most likely
[20:07] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> in which case I'll be taking interviews all week long.
[20:08] <Snowman> His full address is known
[20:08] <Snowman> Dunno what it is though
[20:08] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> It is, but I didn't have it at the time.

[20:09] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> Besides, an email is more fitting in this case, most of the other kids are doing busniesses of places near by, I was doing one based over seas so that's the reason I have email privliages.
[20:09] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> It's for my Final Project of my high school career.
[20:10] <Snowman> You doing it alone?
[20:10] <KodaichiZero> TrueWolves|SchoolProject: You should get your teacher to take the class on a field trip to see Notch in Sweden
[20:10] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> XD
[20:10] <TkTech> You need to be more specific when you're doing research xD
[20:10] <TkTech> And is your teacher requiring consent forms for subjects?
[20:10] <Kizzycocoa> uh, sorry to cut in (was AFK), but this help thing does nothing

[20:10] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> I don't need the forms, but I can't do it with out consent
[20:10] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> If Notch says no I have to look elsewhere
[20:11] <CruelNoise> he'll probably be fine with it
[20:11] <Kizzycocoa> trust me. it'll take a lot to contact that guy
[20:11] <CruelNoise> he's a pretty cool guy
[20:11] <Kizzycocoa> I've tried. XP
[20:11] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> And if Citric says no that's going to hurt some as this whole project is focusing on the problem areas of the community and how they could be theroeticly improved... heheh
[20:11] <CruelNoise> hmm
[20:11] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> I've already contacted Notch Kizzy, it's Citric I'm a bit more worried about.
[20:11] <CruelNoise> i'm sure it'll be fine with everyone.
[20:12] <CruelNoise> when is he usually on?
[20:12] <TrueWolves|SchoolProject> The forum, though it has usefulness, also has a lot of problems. =/
[20:12] <TkTech> TrueWolves|SchoolProject: Again, what are you trying to research, what are the requirements for your subjects?
[20:12] <CruelNoise> i haven't seen him for a while

[20:26] <Konogan> Nice XD
[20:26] <TkTech> sorre: discriminatory then :|
[20:26] <Madtoaster> Why did that bomb not go off.
[20:26] <Quatroking> its not discriminating either
[20:26] <Madtoaster> You guys do know that?
[20:26] <sorre> 'discrimination' implies some sort of action
[20:26] <Quatroking> I just drawed a fish
[20:26] <Quatroking> with a beard
[20:26] <Quatroking> and I named him muhammad

[20:26] <TkTech> Dude, that gets out you'l get death threats
[20:26] <Quatroking> 99% of muslims are called muhammad
[20:27] <sorre> viacom's office?
[20:27] <Madtoaster> Yeah.
[20:27] <Madtoaster> Pfft.
[20:27] <Kizzycocoa> thank god, it seems to have got through
[20:27] <Quatroking> TkTech, that only proves that muslims have no humor

[20:27] * Kald_eats is now known as Kald
[20:27] <Quatroking> "oh no he called a fish muhammad KILL HIM"
[20:27] <sorre> my theory is that the bomb wasn't complete
[20:27] <Madtoaster> My theory is he didnt know how to make a bomb
[20:27] <Madtoaster> Hmm
[20:27] <Madtoaster> Step 1
[20:27] <Madtoaster> Add crap
[20:27] <Madtoaster> Step 2
[20:27] <sorre> he was drivan with his bomb, and it started fucking SMOKING
[20:28] <Madtoaster> Add flamable crap
[20:28] <Quatroking> my theory is that the vietnam guy made the bomb and framed the pakistani
[20:28] <sorre> so he cut his losses, and ditched the car on Times Square
[20:28] <Madtoaster> Quatro.
[20:28] <Madtoaster> You know the truth.

[20:30] <Madtoaster> Damn I have pork
[20:30] <Madtoaster> I dont like pork
[20:30] <TkTech> Seriously, wtf is non-volatile fertilizer going to do? It'll actually dampen the explosion and absorb some of the force, AND it was inside a solid metal gun box
[20:30] <Madtoaster> Give me chicken.
[20:30] <TkTech> which would have further reduced the force of the explosion

[20:35] <Madtoaster> Yes.
[20:35] <Kald> Or even "drill machine", although I liked that one.
[20:35] <Jake> for minecraft?
[20:35] <Madtoaster> There are 10043543534 of them.
[20:35] <Kald> No, it's not what you think.
[20:35] <Jake> crazy
[20:35] <Madtoaster> You like them?
[20:35] <Kald> What annoys me is that these people apparently have no good-god-lovin' idea how COMPLICATED these machines would be.
[20:35] <Madtoaster> And the sheer ammount of them makes you argue with yourself?
[20:35] <Kald> I mean, have you SEEN a steam train's engine?
[20:35] <Madtoaster> Hey, Kald.
[20:35] <Madtoaster> This is Notch.
[20:35] <Kald> There's a cubic bazillion parts.
[20:35] <Madtoaster> He made the world for Ludum Dare.
[20:35] <Kald> Just not feasible.
[20:35] <Kald> ...what?
[20:36] <Madtoaster> Humans are merely a bad coding error.
[20:36] <Madtoaster> Cause by a cat, not Notch.
[20:36] <Madtoaster> Caused*
[20:36] <Madtoaster> Doh.
[20:36] <Kald> Like, going with my metalcasting suggestion
[20:37] <Madtoaster> Im sorry.
[20:37] <Kald> Making all the parts for a steam train engine, you'd use up a ridiculous amount of iron for just the ngine.
[20:37] <Madtoaster> I am Mr.Off Topic.
