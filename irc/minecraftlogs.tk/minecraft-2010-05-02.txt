[0:00] <blaster> Quatroking: Even the official Vuse update runs at 10kb/s
[0:00] <shroomer> they need a mac cheat engine

[0:00] <TestDummy> You can take solance in one thing.
[0:00] <Quatroking> isn't vuse that really scammy client
[0:00] <shroomer> >:L
[0:00] <TestDummy> If it's at least downloading at some rate, it'll eventually finish.
[0:00] <blaster> Its designed for HD
[0:00] <TestDummy> Not as fast as you wanted, but it'll get done at some point.
[0:00] <AlexVMiner> >:D
[0:01] <Quatroking> one of those "zomg you don't seed enough FUCK YOUR SPEED"
[0:01] <blaster> Dunno
[0:01] <Quatroking> designed for HD?
[0:01] <Quatroking> what?
[0:01] <blaster> HD video
[0:01] * Quatroking googles vuse
[0:01] <blaster> At least I think it used to be
[0:01] <blaster> Only for HD video
[0:02] <Quatroking> that looks a lot like limewire
[0:02] <shroomer> IM SICK OF THIS
[0:02] <shroomer> lol
[0:02] <blaster> The old interface was less profesional
[0:02] <blaster> But looked better
[0:02] <Quatroking> try some uTorrent, its really basic and does its job like its supposed to
[0:02] <AndrewPH> blaster, Get a real client.
[0:02] * gdude2002 is now known as puma
[0:02] <blaster> Like actual profesional softwar
[0:02] * puma is now known as gdude2002
[0:02] <AndrewPH> And get torrents that actually have seeds
[0:02] <blaster> Instead of something made in spare time with a confusing UI
[0:02] <AndrewPH> and forward a port and use it
[0:02] <blaster> Vuse torrent has over 4000 seeds
[0:03] <Quatroking> for the entire database of torrents?
[0:03] <pontusedberg> Gravity duck not amused.
[0:03] <Visiiri> Seeds OPEN or seeders?

[0:04] <Quatroking> becaure really, what you're doing right now is typical myspace faggotry
[0:04] <Quatroking> because*
[0:04] <blaster> I hate myspace
[0:04] <Quatroking> exactly.
[0:04] <AndrewPH> Also forward a port since that's probably why your download speed is shitty
[0:04] <blaster> I did
[0:04] <blaster> Lol
[0:04] <AndrewPH> and use it
[0:04] <blaster> When I did not it was at 1 bit per a second
[0:04] <blaster> 1 fucking bit
[0:04] <AndrewPH> and use it
[0:04] <Quatroking> http://www.utorrent.com/

[0:58] <blaster> Lol
[0:58] <AzureAngelic> and now one of them has a lower body wound ans i unconcious
[0:58] <AzureAngelic> failure
[0:58] <Darnest> gunpowder is way too hard to get compared to its effect
[0:58] <blaster> Thats why you train wrestling first
[0:58] <Darnest> in the time it takes to collect the materials to get tnt
[0:58] <Darnest> you could have mined 10 times that
[0:58] <AzureAngelic> i was trainig wreslting though lol

[0:59] <AzureAngelic> wow i suck at typing today
[0:59] <blaster> Oh
[0:59] <Darnest> Notch should make tnt explode entire mountains
[0:59] <blaster> Lol
[0:59] <Darnest> or make gunpowder easier to get
[0:59] <blaster> Darnest thats called a nuke
[0:59] <AzureAngelic> tnt should be a nuclear catsplosion
[0:59] <blaster> But I think you should be able to use coal as a weak subsitute for TNT
[0:59] <blaster> When combined with something else
[0:59] <Zaneo> or when you make the tnt if produces more then one
[0:59] <Darnest> blaster: maybe he could at least make it 1 gunpowder = 1 tnt
[0:59] <Darnest> right now, it's just way too hard to get tnt
[1:00] <blaster> I had a great idea
[1:00] <blaster> Glass bombs
[1:00] <AzureAngelic> i prefer thermocatsplosions
[1:00] <blaster> To craft you get gunpowder surrouned by glass
[1:00] <blaster> Creates high speed shrapnel of death
[1:00] <AzureAngelic> wouldnt that be gravelbomb?

[1:01] <Zaneo> mix iron and aluminium thermite xD
[1:02] <Zaneo> ,thermite*
[1:02] <Darnest> zermite

[1:02] <Darnest> by jumping in
[1:02] <AzureAngelic> oh ffs another goblin ambush
[1:02] <blaster> I wish you could make them blow up still
[1:02] <Zaneo> Aluminium is naturally occurring? albeit not very pure most of the time
[1:03] <Darnest> and letting the creepers explode eachother
[1:03] <blaster> By chain reactioning
[1:03] <Darnest> blaster: you can
[1:03] <Darnest> blaster: you can chain TNT
[1:03] <blaster> Only in survival
[1:03] <Darnest> blaster: it used to work in infdev

[1:08] <AzureAngelic> and a baby
[1:08] <AzureAngelic> i dont know why but a baby was there too

[1:43] <bildramer> too many periods
[1:43] <Siiseli> it's not worth saying
[1:43] <outsomnia> Instant-kick, yes I agree.

[1:43] <Dommys> [17:43] <@Siiseli> word
[1:43] <CruelNoise> That's not a deal
[1:43] <bildramer> :l
[1:43] <CruelNoise> M
[1:43] <Siiseli> Dommys, a correction of a typo is a different thing my dear
[1:43] <CruelNoise> That's simply a philosophy
[1:43] <outsomnia> A ban? too harsh, but a kick? totally worth it
[1:43] <Dommys> MWAHAHA
[1:43] <bildramer> It could be worth saying if it's 2 words, right?

[1:44] * bildramer was kicked from #minecraft by Siiseli
[1:44] <outsomnia> Siiselly, what's your policy on quoting?

[1:44] <bildramer> lol
[1:45] <Dommys> I don't get "the game" anyways
[1:45] <bildramer> should downgrade to weekly
[1:45] <Siiseli> outsomnia, well why would anyone do it without a good reason?
[1:45] <Siiseli> Dommys, it's a fucking stupid /b/tard thing
[1:45] <bildramer> did Notch join today and/or yesterday?
[1:45] <outsomnia> okay
[1:45] <Dommys> Because bildramer is into BDSM, and wants to feel the welt of your bootprint on his ass
[1:45] <bildramer> wat
[1:45] <Dommys> ^ one word
[1:45] <Siiseli> anyway, point being, if your message has no real content in it, it's not worth posting, so dont'

[1:55] <bildramer> I still wonder what's with autojoin
[1:55] <Dommys> then channel the "end" so it connects
[1:55] <outsomnia> So wouldn't it make much more sense to just implement that channel mode here rather than force everyone to manually turn off their autorejoins and just manually type 1 line that does the same thing?
[1:55] <AzureAngelic> and the carp have taken two victims
[1:55] <outsomnia> ':|?
[1:55] <bildramer> you only leave a channel and want to join back when kicked

[2:00] <CruelNoise> What does +j do?
[2:00] <outsomnia> And I don't really see any of the OP's being bothered by the joins.

[2:00] <outsomnia> +j only allows a specified amount of users to join the channel in ## seconds.
[2:01] <Siiseli> outsomnia, no you see then they will not fucking take their autojoins off and will continue to use them elsewhere
[2:01] <bildramer> now let's move on with discussion

[2:01] <Animator> Make a channel and try it.
[2:01] <AzureAngelic> funny, i just imposed the creation of a retractable bridge over magma
[2:01] <bildramer> or that
[2:01] <Snowman> What's +j?
[2:01] <CruelNoise> Siiseli: Wants everything perfect, even those things outside his power
[2:01] <outsomnia> Also urgh, screw personal issues, I'm leaving this shit.

[2:04] <tPRoC> I'm dead.
[2:04] <tPRoC> : O
[2:04] <CruelNoise> .-
[2:04] <Siiseli> as an operator I am here to enforce my personal view on what is good behaviour and what's not, in my opinion evading a kick is not good behaviour
[2:04] <EmpiresBane> hehehe, I'm home alone now. You know what that means
[2:04] <LG_Legacy> How can you evade a kick?
[2:04] <Dommys> FAPFAPFAP
[2:04] <Dommys> You can't.
[2:04] <Siiseli> LG_Legacy, autojoin
[2:04] <LG_Legacy> EmpiresBane Shenanigans?
[2:04] <Snowman> LG_Legacy, it's called dodging
[2:04] <LG_Legacy> Ah
[2:04] <Siiseli> it's sort of an evade
[2:04] <CruelNoise> Technically, he's not evading it
[2:04] <AzureAngelic> water source contaminated, peasant possessed
[2:04] <AzureAngelic> bridges being built
[2:05] <EmpiresBane> actualy... i wasn't planning either of those
[2:05] <Siiseli> why yes CruelNoise but in practice he is
[2:05] <AzureAngelic> i think i've just found some fun
[2:05] <Snowman> If somebody tries to kick you, stand out of their way
[2:05] <CruelNoise> Umno
[2:05] <EmpiresBane> i was just gonna play forbiddden music really loud
[2:05] <LG_Legacy> It annoys me
[2:05] <CruelNoise> He is simply disregarding your personal opinion that he is an asshole or whatever
[2:05] <LG_Legacy> Thats why i ban their name for ten minutes if they rejoin
[2:05] <LG_Legacy> With autojoiner
[2:05] <Siiseli> EmpiresBane, what the fuck is forbidden music
[2:05] <Dommys> I agree that he stil actually left the channel. and then returned after being KICKED. the temporary disconnect being the intial desire of the op. the actual delay of reconnect is the issue, Sisseli wanted that MOFO gone for another 10 seconds.
[2:06] <tPRoC> It is music
[2:06] <tPRoC> That is forbidden.
[2:06] * Fractal (FractalCZ@cpc1-ware1-0-0-cust94.lutn.cable.ntl.com) has joined #minecraft
[2:06] <Animator> There was an old script that I used to have that was formatted to clear out everyone in a channel and prevent autojoin.
[2:06] * Fractal is now known as Fractal_AFK
[2:06] <EmpiresBane> music that i'm not supposed to listen to
[2:06] <Animator> It was basically a 1 seccond ban.
[2:06] <Siiseli> the point is that he left the channel by kick and joined back without doing shit immediatly
[2:06] <tPRoC> like
[2:06] <tPRoC> guilty pleasure or
[2:06] <Siiseli> it's as if he was never kicked
[2:06] <Siiseli> hence, he evaded the kick
[2:06] <tPRoC> do your parents/roomates beat you for listening to certain types of msuic
[2:06] <Siiseli> EmpiresBane, which would bee?
[2:06] <Animator> Siiseli, what kind of IRC client do you use?
[2:06] <Siiseli> and your parents are morons for forbidding you music :D or you're just 10
[2:07] <EmpiresBane> death metal
[2:07] <Siiseli> Animator, irssi
[2:07] <Siiseli> EmpiresBane, hah!
[2:07] <Siiseli> I find this amusing
[2:07] <Animator> Hmmm.
[2:07] <CruelNoise> tPRoC: Music they like, too
[2:07] <Siiseli> Animator, no, I'm not installing extra scripts
[2:07] <Siiseli> this system works just fine
[2:07] <Siiseli> besides, I like rekicking people with autojoin
[2:07] * Eythor (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[2:07] <Animator> Still, one seccond bans can trump autojoins.
[2:07] <LG_Legacy> You know what i hate?
[2:07] <LG_Legacy> People who use "-.-" and too many exclamation marks
[2:07] <tPRoC> I recently started watching One Piece. I like it because it's the only anime where I can tell the difference between dudes and chicks.
[2:07] <tPRoC> : l
[2:07] <Siiseli> Animator, I want them to take off the autojoin, that's the point
[2:08] <CruelNoise> Wow, I just realized that the ops are actually bieng active
[2:08] <Siiseli> tPRoC, what animes have you watched for fucks sake -___-
[2:08] <Snowman> LG_Legacy, I hate people who use XD and too many exclamation marks
[2:08] <Animator> Ahahaha. Good luck with that, Siiseli.
[2:08] * Fractal_AFK is now known as Fractal
[2:08] <Siiseli> Animator, it's worked well so far
[2:08] <tPRoC> a bunch.
[2:08] <Siiseli> because you know
[2:08] <tPRoC> most of them are really pretentious
[2:08] <Siiseli> if they don't take it off
[2:08] <Siiseli> they get banned
[2:08] <tPRoC> the only animes I've ever liked
[2:08] <CruelNoise> Wrong use of pretentious, my friend
[2:08] <Animator> I should really bug Notch to add that rule about autojoin.
[2:08] <tPRoC> are One Piece, Trigun, and Dragon Ball. (not dragon ball z.)
[2:09] <Snowman> Omg, anime discussion, get Quatroking!
[2:09] <Animator> And to just reformat the IRC rules over.
[2:09] <EmpiresBane> i really got to figure out where autojoin is...
[2:09] <tPRoC> anything else I can't stand.
[2:09] <CruelNoise> Lrn2english
[2:09] <Quatroking> bwuh

[2:09] <tPRoC> i dont like how everyone wants me to watch these animes
[2:09] <Quatroking> yay bebop
[2:09] <tPRoC> where all of the characters are one dimensional
[2:10] <Siiseli> but yeah I watched shows like that when I was a kid too TrueWolves
[2:10] <CruelNoise> Recomee
[2:10] <tPRoC> and they only react to things in a specific way.
[2:10] <Siiseli> tPRoC*
[2:10] <Quatroking> haha
[2:10] <tPRoC> and then when they die or something
[2:10] <Quatroking> tproc go watch ghost in the shell
[2:10] <tPRoC> you just sort of laugh because the character was annoying anyways

[2:11] <CruelNoise> I read a book
[2:11] <tPRoC> I am in to philosophy too
[2:11] <Quatroking> the ghost in the shell philosophy is really awesome
[2:11] <tPRoC> I think.
[2:11] <CruelNoise> And it was comedic
[2:11] <Siiseli> so Quatroking, is that a no?
[2:11] <Quatroking> its a yes
[2:11] <tPRoC> I like it when animes are somewhat comedic, because then it seems like the characters are, y'know.

[2:14] <Siiseli> tPRoC, debating religion is like playing chess with a pigeon you know
[2:14] <CruelNoise> tis true
[2:14] <Quatroking> You should try the series too, they're pretty deep
[2:14] <Siiseli> and about politics, if you're a republic you're a dick
[2:14] <Siiseli> and that's pretty much it
[2:14] <tPRoC> i'm a libertarian
[2:14] <Siiseli> or actually
[2:14] <Siiseli> if you're a conservatist you're a dick
[2:14] <Siiseli> OR ACTUALLY
[2:14] <CruelNoise> except playing chess with a pidgeon is visibly futile
[2:14] <Siiseli> if you're any right wing THING

[4:07] <GoaLitiuM> ascii sure looks nasty :(
[4:07] <AzureAngelic> you dont have to use ascii
[4:07] <GoaLitiuM> is there any "GUI"'s?
[4:07] <AzureAngelic> there are graphics packs
[4:08] <GoaLitiuM> ah
[4:08] <AzureAngelic> that tutorial includes a link to 40d with a graphics pack preinstalled
[4:08] <EmpiresBane> all of the files are now intermixed with all my game shortcuts
[4:08] <GoaLitiuM> then i might take a look
[4:08] <EmpiresBane> it's not actual ascii
[4:08] <AzureAngelic> you just have to tweak something and boom, you have mostly little images
[4:08] <EmpiresBane> it's really just a bunch of pictures that look like ascii

[5:05] * Zaneo (chatzilla@bas2-toronto36-1177696378.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
[5:05] <Calhoun> He didn't make an estimate.
[5:06] <Tennist0> he said he would try to distribute late last week, sounds like an estimate to me
[5:06] <Calhoun> Where are you seeing that at?
[5:07] <Tennist0> im pretty sure he said it on his twitter
[5:07] <blaster> All the boatmurdered artifacts have pictures of elephants killing dwarfs because so many dwarfs have been killed by em
[5:07] <Tennist0> it was a reply to someone else
[5:08] * SMP (SMP@68-114-62-5.dhcp.davl.vt.charter.com) has left #minecraft
[5:08] <Yourself> there's a reason he didn't say something like that where a bunch of people would see it
[5:08] <Calhoun> Eh, But in his own words " the blog is better for official news, twitter is mostly personal chatter.. like this!"
[5:08] <Tennist0> the exact "tweet": http://twitter.com/foxes8787/status/12836970331
[5:09] * AlexVMiner (AlexVMiner@75.97.177.12.res-cmts.mtp.ptd.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[5:09] <Calhoun> Also, he didn't say PUBLIC tests.
[5:09] <Tennist0> still, notch's word is notch's word. I doubt he'd lie just because it isn't the prefered source for news
[5:09] <Calhoun> so yeah.
[5:09] <Yourself> there's a difference between lying and being wrong
[5:09] <Tennist0> oh, and that link was wrong
[5:09] <Tennist0> that was what notch replied to
[5:10] <Yourself> i never expected for him to get much done in only a week
[5:10] <firetempest> what we want when we say things wont always happen. its a reason why some companies will never give a time frame
[5:10] <Tennist0> estimates are sometimes wrong, hence "estimate"
[5:10] <Yourself> i've said it before, if the blog doesn't say anything, there's nothing to be said
[5:11] * xTesseract (Mibbit@99-5-238-160.lightspeed.stlsmo.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:11] <Tennist0> i disagree, this was a small test, if he wanted the entire community to participate, it would not go straight to the irc for testing
[5:11] * ylt (youliketha@92.22.177.242) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[5:11] <Tennist0> he would test it on the main site
[5:11] <Primis> back
[5:12] <Calhoun> Did you just counter your own argument?
[5:12] <Tennist0> no
[5:12] <Animator> I believe he just did, actually.
[5:13] <Animator> When I compare this:
[5:13] <Animator> [21:05] <Tennist0> so...notch was late in his estimate of first multiplayer tests I suppose?
[5:13] <Calhoun> Well, you started out saying he missed his timeframe, now you're saying he probably did this.
[5:13] <Animator> And this:
[5:13] <Tennist0> no, im saying if he were going to make this a community wide test, it would go into the official source of news
[5:13] <Animator> [21:10] <Tennist0> estimates are sometimes wrong, hence "estimate"
[5:13] <Tennist0> which is why i asked in the first place, because it was an estimate, how could i know if this was a small test?
[5:13] <blaster> OMG Boatmurdered had an accident flooding the whole outside so the ruler war forced to use lava to fix it
[5:13] <Tennist0> and if notch has been here recently
[5:14] <blaster> Turned the whole outside into charred rubble
[5:14] <Calhoun> If you look a few tweets later, he says SECRET testing.
[5:14] <Tennist0> he said somewhere else he would distribute on the irc
[5:14] <Yourself> yeah, on the blog
[5:14] <Animator> He said he would be distributing it on the IRC for select people.
[5:14] <Tennist0> exactly
[5:14] <Animator> Not the entire IRC.
[5:14] <Yourself> and if you go through the logs from the irc that day, he said he'd almost be certainly playing favorites
[5:14] <Animator> Bingo.
[5:15] <Yourself> so unless you know him well, it's not going to be you
[5:15] <Animator> Double-bingo.
[5:15] <Tennist0> alright, thats all i need to know

[5:15] <Yourself> yeah, let's me check when some members make claims about things notch said that aren't true
[5:16] <Yourself> which is why i was reading them in the first place

[5:16] <Tennist0> what?

[5:23] <vurtual> I'm blinking, thinking it's just some stuff in my eyes, but then it comes back quickly, and I'm barely able to read anything.

[5:51] <Yourself> now i seem to have misplaced the battery
[5:51] <Yourself> wtf
[5:51] <Rooster> heres one

[5:51] * Rooster hands battery through to internet
[5:52] <Lep> it had no pci port, no video, or anything
[5:52] <Rooster> *the
[5:52] <Lep> so when it never posted again, I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it
[5:52] <Yourself> i've somehow managed to lose the cmos battery
[5:52] <Yourself> i have no idea how i lost it
[5:52] <EmpiresBane> the worst thing i've ever had happen is a hammer fall out of a tree on my head
[5:53] <Yourself> i know i put it on my desk
[5:53] <Konogan> what is the upload speed needed for a minecraft creative server?
[5:53] <Yourself> but it's clearly not on my desk
[5:53] <Yourself> ahh, found it
[5:53] <vurtual> Konogan, you can technically host on dial-up
[5:53] <Yourself> slid under the keyboard
[5:53] <Konogan> I want numbers. :P
[5:53] <EmpiresBane> 4b
[5:53] <vurtual> No no no, it's your new battery, spat out of your keyboard, sent from rooster, Yourself.

[5:57] <vurtual> If only I had paypal
[5:57] <vurtual> some kind of theoretical paypal where I have money in it

[5:58] <Rooster> Quick gang best GTA?
[5:58] <vurtual> I dunno lol
[5:58] <vurtual> I'd say vice city but that's because of temporal nostalgia
[5:58] <Miclee> GTA1
[5:58] <Miclee> :P
[5:59] <Yourself> fsck for the win
[5:59] <vurtual> Because I played it once
[5:59] <vurtual> and then everybody claimed it did not exist
[5:59] <vurtual> and I'm like "wtf man"
[5:59] <vurtual> Then they "just buy it" later, when it actually comes out
[5:59] <vurtual> and then I'm sitting here going "wtf is going on" to myself, for about a good minute.

[6:00] <Rooster> I think u can get every GTA for 50 bucks

[6:02] <Lep> I bought GTA 4 for $7.50 around New Years
[6:02] <Yourself> anyway, after this massive waste of time with the ubuntu machine, i can get back to work
[6:02] <Lep> I was going to buy San Andreas yesterday but forgot
[6:02] <Rooster> L4D2 is 30 dollars
[6:02] <Rooster> Wtf
[6:02] <vurtual> you need a certain level of graphical awesomeness of design, and then everybody will always like the graphics, at least a little bit
[6:02] <vurtual> See: HL2.
[6:02] <vurtual> Rooster, don't doo iiit
[6:03] <Visiiri> Crash
[6:03] <Rooster> I;m not, probably can't
[6:03] <vurtual> Unless you really, really want a few extra maps and badly-designed gameplay, and badly-designed maps, it's nothing worth looking at.
[6:03] <Lep> I bought Left 4 Dead 2 and never even played it >:(
[6:03] <Rooster> What
[6:03] <Rooster> Fucking give it to me
[6:03] <vurtual> Back in my day, there were 3 guns, one pistol, and one item per slot. Two guns, if you weren't tier 2!
[6:04] <Konogan> I bought a lot of games, finished only 1/10 of them. D:
[6:04] <Lep> steam doesn't let me give away games
[6:04] <vurtual> I've wondered about the ridiculous amount of spending I do on games.
[6:04] <vurtual> But I've finished nearly every last one on my list that can be.
[6:04] <Rooster> Ya I know, it's sad
[6:04] <Rooster> I actually haven't played HL1 fully
[6:04] <Animator> I fucking love Hurrican now.
[6:04] <Rooster> It's "broken"

[6:30] <vurtual> anyoen who does the math notices this
[6:30] <vurtual> portal 2 was apparent in development since portal came out
[6:31] <vurtual> and left 4 dead 2 was thought to be a CS2.
[6:31] <Yourself> it's yet to be announced
[6:31] <vurtual> Well announced that they want to sorta think about releasing it
[6:32] <vurtual> "Hey guys we have this game, it's mostly done-looking and we need user feedback now. We're sorta thinking about releasing it this year maybe just potentially like it's sorta a concept now. Maybe."

[6:33] <vurtual> the first thing that happened during christmas, is he wanted to gift me.
[6:33] <vurtual> "Now here's a really humorously composed blog post about some tf2 video because we just love being humorous."
[6:34] <EmpiresBane> remember when everyone was going on about how retarded Notch was because everyone was gonna get minecraft gifted to them
[6:34] <vurtual> Also earlier today/my yesterday, I had a guy insisting that any software being proprietary is wrong.
[6:34] <EmpiresBane> then suddenly, they realized they were complete idiots?
[6:34] <vurtual> and that it's evil
[6:34] <vurtual> Steam is wrong because of this, every game you can buy is wrong
[6:34] <vurtual> and he insists that every last game would have been better if it were free and open source
[6:34] <C418> I made a piece for mash man
[6:34] <Rooster> He's a socialist
[6:34] <vurtual> yup

[6:36] <vurtual> and he "does not want fps" because of his memory of the 3 attempts at an open source shooter.

[6:41] <vurtual> Unfortunately for you, people are just plain too nice and, despite any negative views(except in rare cases where they conflict far too much), are generally far too bearable for that to work.

[6:42] <vurtual> and stopped rapists, cults.
[6:43] <vurtual> dealt a hard blow to one of the most unstoppable forces on the planet, who threw around lawsuits to anyone who dared oppose them to their face.
[6:43] <EmpiresBane> can you cite any that?

[6:43] <vurtual> Don't you remember that?

[6:48] <vurtual> They're a different person, who hasn't learned.
[6:48] <vurtual> I've seen what happens to people when you snap out at them.
[6:48] <Animator> He obviously doesn't want to learn.
[6:48] <vurtual> The mental and oh-so-physical scars are apparent.
[6:49] <vurtual> To the point now that I've become some kind of instinct-killer because of people doing this.

[6:49] <Animator> Tough love. The community will eat him up anyway. Maybe it's the music pushing the adrenaline...
[6:49] <vurtual> It won't be long before someone competent in dealing with overly abusive ops steps up to actively fight against you.
[6:49] <vurtual> Or just make a site better.
[6:49] <vurtual> Granted, people who can pull that off are one in a million
[6:49] <Animator> Overly abusive? I'm not overly abusive.
[6:50] <Rooster> WHAT THE HELL
[6:50] <vurtual> Did you actually preform any child-friendly methods of dealing with this?
[6:50] <Animator> I didn't insult the guy, I just told him to stop begging.
[6:50] <vurtual> Ban him for a bit, stick in his face the rules, how he's doing somethign wrong, and how that if he calmly thinks about every action, and chooses inaction and study, he'll be a lot better off, and popular?
[6:50] <vurtual> like, ten minutes, so he can read what you wote
[6:51] <Rooster> He's 9 years old
[6:51] <vurtual> You were 9 once
[6:51] <Rooster> good luck with that

[6:52] <Rooster> :D
[6:52] <vurtual> The downside is that puberty could have made me commit suicide out of fear of all the screwed up stuff my head did because of what I had to deal with when I was 9
[6:53] <Rooster> Where did Animator go
[6:53] <vurtual> Either thinking calmly about his actions, or in a banspree.
[6:53] <vurtual> probably a banspree
[6:53] * Rooster hopes for a ban spree
[6:53] <vurtual> yeah and make another me
[6:53] <Animator> Somewhere in the middle.
[6:53] <vurtual> If you're lucky, he won't hate your guts!
[6:53] <Konogan> Om nom nom, Bansprees...
[6:54] <Animator> Oh please, vurtual.
[6:54] <Rooster> What if we had the physics gun from Gmod in Minecraft
[6:54] <vurtual> I still have this mark along my arm right here.
[6:54] <Animator> If he hated my guts, he'd be one in a vast list.
[6:54] <vurtual> Yeah, those people grow up.

[6:55] <vurtual> but illogically they end up surprisingly healthy and better-off.
[6:55] <Rooster> That's deep vurtual
[6:55] <Rooster> see what I did there
[6:55] <vurtual> Hey, maybe ending up like me is one of those things you're better off with, despite hwo much you want to deny it

[7:02] <Jake> surely it's a case of going to the url and playing it
[7:02] <Rooster> I bet he will make a new account, can he do that?
[7:02] <Animator> "Get" as in get someone to buy it for him.
[7:02] <Animator> I can make wildcards.

[7:03] <Undead_Zeratul> what game you want to watch?
[7:03] <Jake> 9? pissing hell I hate kids
[7:03] <Jake> what are my options?
[7:03] <Animator> It's not the age, it's the principle.
[7:04] <Undead_Zeratul> uhm, I would have emulators, but my external holding them is at my house, I have skulltag and gzdoom for some doom
[7:04] <Jake> that's hideous quality
[7:04] <Undead_Zeratul> and well, minecraft... but that eats at my CPU on this laptop
[7:04] <Animator> Now, I'm going to restructure the entire rule system for the forums.
[7:04] <Rooster> Awesome
[7:04] <Undead_Zeratul> diablo 2
[7:04] <Animator> Make them harder and then presecute everyone.

[7:05] <Rooster> persecute
[7:05] <Animator> I'm only kidding about the persecute part.
[7:05] <vurtual> riiight
[7:05] <Rooster> not presecute, not pursecute. Persecute
[7:05] <Jake> excellent, people are scum
[7:05] <Undead_Zeratul> prosecute?
[7:05] <Animator> But with stronger, more firm rules, I'll hunt them down better with cleaner, more defined limits.
[7:06] <Rooster> mmmm..firm
[7:06] <Undead_Zeratul> lol nice
[7:06] <Animator> I actually had an old document for Minecraft rules.
[7:06] <Jake> any progress on hacks for infdev? I want to flyyy across the place
[7:06] <vurtual> but they're your limits!
[7:06] <Animator> Jake.
[7:06] <Animator> Don't talk about that here.
[7:06] <vurtual> They could be "when you're tired of hunting them, until you'er not tired anymore"!
[7:06] <Rooster> Animator, it's not like no one has hacks
[7:07] <Animator> Notch's channel, Notch's rules. I enforce them.
[7:07] <Jake> hax is right at the title of the IRC
[7:07] <Rooster> I think of that as the bicycle helmet rule
[7:07] <Rooster> few enforce it
[7:07] <Animator> Not in here.
[7:07] <Rooster> fair enough
[7:07] <vurtual> Bicycle helmets aren't law anywhere
[7:07] <Jake> " Welcome to my Minecraft Server! -hax - idiocy"
[7:07] <vurtual> that I know of
[7:08] <Undead_Zeratul> setting up the livestream procaster, i'll go live soon
[7:08] <Animator> You might say the Bycycle Helment analogy best suits the "Only talk about Minecraft here" rule.
[7:08] <vurtual> only when mom is watching ok
[7:08] <vurtual> infact I crashed once without one pretty bad, and got up fine.
[7:08] <vurtual> It may have taken all of my inner motivation to look like some kind of Will Smith, but I was fine.

[7:10] <vurtual> Kuro, what program are you using?
[7:10] <Animator> Paint.Net has an option for that.
[7:10] <vurtual> 99% of them have a "grid" button
[7:10] <Jake> what are you making art for? I love pixel art
[7:11] <vurtual> even paint does
[7:11] <vurtual> evening of the first day
[7:11] <vurtual> 52 hours remain

[7:11] <Darkfire002> i knew that

[7:13] <Undead_Zeratul> nethack?
[7:13] <Darkfire002> one of the only 2d things in the game is the mood
[7:13] <Darkfire002> doon
[7:13] <vurtual> I've made it pretty big without any real ill effect, Darkfire002.
[7:13] <vurtual> Cept crashes due to filesize
[7:13] <vurtual> and that stars draw above it
[7:13] <vurtual> so it's actually infinitely far away
[7:13] <Darkfire002> made it big where?
[7:13] <vurtual> if you can keep the filesize down somehow while keeping the extension, you can make fairly large moon sprites
[7:14] <Jake> what does it mean that top importance on the todo list is "thwart hacking"?
[7:14] <vurtual> Though if you're too lazy, you can just do this: http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/4187/mmmoon.png
[7:14] <vurtual> jake, it'll be assuredly done before mp is released
[7:14] <Darkfire002> oh were talking about sprites.....
[7:14] <Rooster> Oh god that's creepy
[7:14] <Jake> what's he meaning though?
[7:14] <Keiya> This character has a basic speed of 12, a basic move of 20, and enhanced move 5
[7:14] <vurtual> he's going to add hacks into minecraft
[7:14] <vurtual> If I can stretch the sprite without increasing the filesize
[7:15] <vurtual> I could have it take up half a sky
[7:15] <Darkfire002> no hes going to destroy them

[7:21] <Jake> coal and iron are fine
[7:21] <vurtual> but you find it
[7:21] <vurtual> remember when Malikat had blasted a gigantic room with TNT?
[7:21] <vurtual> And he found a bunch of ore and diamonds?
[7:21] <Jake> nope
[7:21] <vurtual> you'll find it
[7:21] <Visiiri> Guize, Imma post what I just made
[7:21] <vurtual> lots of it
[7:21] <vurtual> That would be your mother, Visiiri.
[7:21] <vurtual> you're posting your mother
[7:21] <Darkfire002> and vurtual : why a grid insted of a line?
[7:22] <vurtual> a line just goes forward
[7:22] <Jake> grid is more efficient
[7:22] <vurtual> and it'll never hit ore in it's 3 block detection radius
[7:22] <vurtual> a grid will cover everything
[7:22] <Darkfire002> ok
[7:22] <Darkfire002> but
[7:22] <Darkfire002> say i dig a grid
[7:22] <Darkfire002> im covering a certian area
[7:22] * Jake nods
[7:23] <Darkfire002> but in a line im coving the same ammount of space but in a different spot
[7:23] <vurtual> okay which is more likely of hitting miens in minesweeper
[7:23] <vurtual> if they occour in clusters
[7:23] <vurtual> clicking in a grid
[7:23] <vurtual> or just clicking in a line
[7:23] <Darkfire002> though i did go for the turnaround and found diamond
[7:23] <vurtual> increased surface area
[7:23] <Darkfire002> how is it increaced
[7:23] <vurtual> With a line, there's only the immediately bordering tiles in the walls are visible
[7:23] <Darkfire002> very time u delete 2 blocks u uncover 26 spaces
[7:23] <Darkfire002> yes
[7:24] <Darkfire002> but with a grid, it is a line with bends
[7:24] <vurtual> In a grid, only things smaller than your grid holes can get through
[7:24] <vurtual> which aren't that important
[7:24] <Jake> any cool indev files I can look at here?
[7:24] <Jake> I want to see what people have done
[7:24] <vurtual> no
[7:24] <Visiiri> I've done your mom, if that counts.
[7:25] <Darkfire002> infdev files cant be shared can they
[7:25] <vurtual> Infdev is bad for making shiny looking things
[7:25] <Jake> exactly
[7:25] <Jake> creative mode boggles my mind
[7:25] <Darkfire002> .....?
[7:25] <vurtual> http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/5052/colosseum3.png this took a day about
[7:25] * Primis test
[7:25] <Jake> I can't see any motivation to build there
[7:25] <vurtual> Maybe I'm a slow builder
[7:25] <Jake> but indev/infdev. you've got limited(ish) resources and monsters and such
[7:25] <vurtual> maybe I'm too detail-obsessed

[7:33] <Darkfire002> pickaxe
[7:33] <MarkTraceur> That answers all my questions
[7:33] <Darkfire002> ?
[7:33] <Darkfire002> good
[7:33] <vurtual> You're like mail in your short language-snippets
[7:33] <vurtual> but not humorous while doing it
[7:33] <PoF59[DS]> 59 is a number I pulled out of my ass when PrinceOfFire was taken. I was 10, thought it sounded cool *shrugs*
[7:34] <vurtual> All names are actually secretly made by when you're 10.
[7:34] <Darkfire002> vurtual: What?
[7:34] <Norend> big booty bitches
[7:34] <vurtual> It's the subconscious rite of passage
[7:34] <Darkfire002> what?
[7:34] <Jake> it's heartwarming to still have things online from when you were a kid
[7:34] <Visiiri> Norend: Can I assume you recently watched = 3
[7:34] <Jake> unfortunately, when I was little, I was using warhammer-related names
[7:35] <PoF59[DS]> PrinceOfFire59>PoF59 and I'm on a Nintendo DS homebrew app.
[7:35] <Norend> I watched it a few days ago
[7:35] <Jake> I made the right choice to switch to "DDRJake" for everything
[7:35] <Darkfire002> i used saber boy9 as a child
[7:35] <Darkfire002> now darkfire
[7:35] <Jake> oooh, I've been meaning to explore the DS homebrew scene
[7:35] <Darkfire002> darkstorm
[7:35] <Darkfire002> darkfrost
[7:35] <Norend> Anyone up for some L4D?
[7:35] <Visiiri> Norend: L4D2?
[7:35] <Darkfire002> 002 is a good number, never taken
[7:35] <Jake> I love my CycloDS to bits
[7:35] <Norend> Yeah
[7:36] <Norend> L4D2 it is
[7:36] <Jake> L4D2 just doesn't tickle my fancy

[7:36] <EmpiresBane> What?
[7:36] <EmpiresBane> Who are you?
[7:36] <EmpiresBane> How did I get here?
[7:37] <vurtual> l4d 2 sucks
[7:37] <Konogan> Killing Floor is hard.
[7:37] <vurtual> l4d-not-2 is awesome though
[7:37] <Konogan> ^^
[7:37] <EmpiresBane> And where are my pants?
[7:37] <vurtual> What's with all the floor-killing
[7:37] <vurtual> and street-fighting
[7:37] <Konogan> Rofl.
[7:37] <Jake> killing floor is brilliant
[7:37] <Norend> Either L4D is fine, and Killing Floor is good
[7:37] <Jake> and now I'm off to play some
[7:37] <Darkfire002> im gona go make scones
[7:37] <Darkfire002> my favorite lunch
[7:37] <Darkfire002> lol
[7:37] <vurtual> I refuse to actually go out of my way for killing floor
[7:37] <Darkfire002> ftw :D
[7:37] <vurtual> since this troll I know insists I paly it
[7:37] <PoF59[DS]> EXCUSE ME BOY, WHAT YEAR IS THIS?!
[7:37] <vurtual> and is shocked that I don't seek interest just because it has chainsaws
[7:37] <Norend> It's worth the money, vurtual, if you have friends that play it too
[7:38] <Jake> the chainsaw in Killing Floor is one of the worst weapons
[7:38] <Norend> I know
[7:38] <vurtual> The friends I know who play it are the people who I talk about in here that cause nightmares to users.
[7:38] <vurtual> I do not ever want to ever have to deal with them actually having a weapon near me
[7:38] <vurtual> the amount of tking is phenominal
[7:38] <Jake> it's a great game for Clutching on though
[7:38] <vurtual> intentional, unstoppable tking
[7:38] <Jake> good thing there's no FF on killing floor
[7:39] <Jake> except for special FF servers...
[7:39] <vurtual> Also I almost always win at deathmatch games aginst them now, since I've finally figured out which arenas in games are the temple of retribution-style ones.
[7:39] <vurtual> so they quit
[7:39] <vurtual> Then claim I never win.
[7:39] <vurtual> This shockingly fits the description of my brother, hmm.
[7:39] <Jake> almost 5am....perfect time for gaming
[7:39] <PoF59[DS]> Everyone is secretly vurt's bro.
[7:40] <vurtual> yes
[7:40] <vurtual> I will fight you all
[7:40] <Konogan> And you will never win.
[7:40] <vurtual> I won alot, even when I was many years younger than him
[7:40] <vurtual> I took every single punch he threw and slammed into things, but kept going.
[7:41] <Konogan> Shit, your brther did your father's job...
[7:41] <Konogan> brother*
[7:41] <vurtual> At first he wasn't serious, then he was apparently actually hitting me hard(I didn't notice that much), and I just went back at him.
[7:41] <vurtual> until he sorta ran away
[7:41] <Konogan> Just kidding.
[7:41] <vurtual> one time I got rope for christmas.
[7:41] <vurtual> one time him and one of my sisters tied me up in said very strong rope, and I was left alone without any way to actually get out
[7:41] <Konogan> Weird... I can't find my psp...
[7:42] <PoF59[DS]> Lampoil? Rope? BOMBS?!
[7:42] <vurtual> Had I not been in the living room it would have been very possible that nobody would have found me.
[7:42] <vurtual> If I got bombs for christmas that would pwn
[7:42] <Norend> Visiiri where did you go
[7:42] <Konogan> Vurtual, sounds like a fun familly :D
[7:42] <PoF59[DS]> YOU WANT IT? IT'S YOURS MY FRIEND!
[7:43] <vurtual> also my mother's really religious
[7:43] <vurtual> and watches preachers on TV
[7:43] * Jake wholeheartedly hates religion
[7:43] <PoF59[DS]> AS LONG AS YOU HAVE ENOUGH RUBIES
[7:43] <vurtual> they get an expensive new laptop so they can... listen to people talking about their religious experiences
[7:43] <vurtual> and she can't even use the "clear all" button on firefox download window
[7:43] <vurtual> it took her about am onth to understand it enough to clear it once
[7:43] <vurtual> You hate me eh dyou jake
[7:43] <vurtual> come say that to my face I am very scary to the face
[7:43] <Konogan> I never clear it... although it's intentional. :P
[7:44] <Jake> I hate religion, not the folks who follow it
[7:44] <vurtual> I'm honestly sometimes the other way around
[7:44] <Jake> I hate gorgonzola too, but not those who eat it
[7:44] <vurtual> Sure, most of them are generally nice... generally.

[7:48] <devined> Is your mom a hacker?
[7:48] <vurtual> reverse of it
[7:48] <vurtual> The most unlikely ways possible cause problems
[7:48] <vurtual> She had a huge, firefox-distorting window because of printer drivers, and we still don't know how she broke firefox and caused there to be 4 sets of back/forward/stop/reload/home buttons.

[7:50] <vurtual> nah it's not quite the same as that
[7:50] <vurtual> now whenever I need to make her go away I just say stuff like "Adobe reader questionmark okay."
[7:50] <PoF59[DS]> 3do once ragemail'd me for torrenting HOMM3, a gameI OWN.
[7:50] <vurtual> Reminding her of all her infections and adobe-reader-exploit-problems
[7:51] <Konogan> Ew.
[7:51] <Konogan> PoF How?
[7:51] <vurtual> Then someone else who she trusts more because she's not directly related to them(it's an engineering thing apparently. The farther away they are, the better they are.), and they're not as apparently young as me.
[7:51] <vurtual> installs adobe reader again

[7:52] <Visiiri> I tried filesmelt, but it's being slow
[7:52] <PoF59[DS]> And I said, "I BOUGHT THE GAME". Turns out they were mad because I gave a friend the torrent link so we could play online
[7:52] <Malikat> rofl i just finished reading the saga of boatmurdered
[7:53] <vurtual> I remember using some file site that was pretty obscure, at one time blocked by a network because of spammers using it once, but had no actual faults and was in general, nice.
[7:53] <vurtual> Then it was getting "upgraded" and then eventually got domain squatted.
[7:53] <PoF59[DS]> said friend recieved no ragemail himself.
[7:53] <Konogan> PoF how did they knew?
[7:53] <vurtual> They're watching youu
[7:53] <Konogan> Visiiri, you made that?

[7:53] <vurtual> commie

[7:53] <PoF59[DS]> No fucking clue. 3do has copyright ninjas or summat.
[7:54] <Konogan> Rofl.
[7:54] <Visiiri> I did make this, good sir.
[7:54] <Visiiri> It took me a few hours.
[7:54] <vurtual> Also guys, youtube's reccomender is a bit screwed up

[7:55] <PoF59[DS]> I really wanna play Majesty for some reasom.
[7:56] <vurtual> "ichihime", the video is called, some kind of potentially Japanese that I cannot read.
[7:56] <Undead_Zeratul> does anyone here have the perfect dark xbox live arcade version?

[8:16] <Visiiri> Yessir!
[8:16] <Undead_Zeratul> :D
[8:16] <vurtual> but the march of the droids is pwn
[8:16] <Undead_Zeratul> i love any of the droid battles
[8:16] <Undead_Zeratul> i think it's cause that's the most hack-n-slash scenes
[8:16] <Lep> the reviews of episodes 1 and 2 were far better than the movies themselves
[8:16] <Visiiri> Guess what
[8:16] <Undead_Zeratul> idk, i like all of them
[8:16] <Visiiri> Did you see that spinny flippy kick thing?
[8:17] <Visiiri> That was nice.
[8:17] <Undead_Zeratul> yes

[8:23] <Jake> Problem Sleuth was brilliant
[8:23] <Smoo> i was amazed he had that much internal consistency
[8:24] <Undead_Zeratul> problem sleuth was amazing, i came in late, but i was blown away the entire time

[8:26] <vurtual> see episodes 4-6
[8:26] <vurtual> Visiiri, the alternative is I invite you over to my house and we listen to it here, which is entirely legal.
[8:27] <TrueWolves> The Midnight Crew's origins are from a non-canon side story in Problem Slueth btw

[8:51] <FireRat> Alright who can help me with making a private server?
[8:51] <AndrewPH> UltimateBudgie, google it
[8:51] <vurtual> FireRat, we can show you the door, but you must open it yourself.
[8:51] <AndrewPH> FireRat, public = false
[8:51] <vurtual> http://www.minecraft.net/minecraft-server.zip
[8:52] <FireRat> I dl the thing already
[8:52] <FireRat> and I am at a loss from there...
[8:52] <vurtual> public = false
[8:52] <vurtual> then run the batch file
[8:52] <vurtual> also give it a name and motd
[8:52] <vurtual> and a sane userlimit
[8:52] <AndrewPH> 32 max
[8:52] <UltimateBudgie> #TheOnemcft

[8:55] <vurtual> people read your blog AndrewPH
[8:55] <AndrewPH> wtf

[8:55] <Malikat> AndrewPH why don't you DOS his IP then
[8:55] <AndrewPH> oh ok good
[8:55] <vurtual> actually they love it
[8:55] <AndrewPH> Malikat, I just might
[8:55] <vurtual> There's gonna be a fan-movi
[8:55] <AndrewPH> he's a complete moron and such
[8:55] <vurtual> no no you must bash his ip
[8:55] <Visiiri> AndrewPH: If you do, I'll help.
[8:55] <Malikat> does anyone understand sarcasm
[8:55] <AndrewPH> he hosts his minecraft server off of it
[8:56] <AndrewPH> :D
[8:56] <AndrewPH> fun could happen
[8:56] <Malikat> are you serious you're going to do that shit again
[8:56] <Visiiri> hehheheh
[8:56] <AndrewPH> I would profit off of it
[8:56] <AndrewPH> one less idiot bothering me.
[8:56] <Visiiri> AndrewPH: You should host a vinilla server
[8:56] <ClassiestMedic> ew
[8:56] <Visiiri> vanilla
[8:56] <ClassiestMedic> vanilla is gross
[8:56] <Visiiri> I've not played one in days because of those damn multiworlds
[8:56] <AndrewPH> Visiiri, I will once my friend gets his dedis in
[8:56] <vurtual> screw multiworld
[8:57] <vurtual> it makes garbage
[8:57] <Visiiri> yeah, multiworld is cocks
[8:57] <vurtual> back in my day you had 1 map
[8:57] <Visiiri> Back in my day you had singleplayer.
[8:57] <Visiiri> Without saves.
[8:57] <Rooster> What if this actually happened
[8:57] <vurtual> and people would troll the server by befriending the op and building gigantic, simple structures to annoy you
[8:57] <AndrewPH> I just told him to start the vanilla server he has on one of his machines
[8:57] <Rooster> http://xkcd.com/451/

[8:58] <Visiiri> lol, "It takes TWO to fill me up"
[8:58] <vurtual> no Malikat
[8:58] <Animator> Some dude made the wheel. It was overrated.
[8:58] <vurtual> like a gigantic blocky spiders and such, adorned with british flags
[8:58] <vurtual> and weird messed up nipples
[8:58] <vurtual> which they can talk on and on about for no reason
[8:58] <vurtual> so I decided I was sick of all the troll-ops
[8:59] <vurtual> and I placed random sappers on all of them.
[8:59] <vurtual> which had no actual changes to the structure, and were nearly impossible to find
[8:59] <vurtual> they raged so hard that they wanted to banip everyone again.

[9:13] <AndrewPH> that I'm getting an octo core dedi and he isn't
[9:13] <AndrewPH> Visiiri, it's meant as a 'turn on and go' os
[9:13] <Visiiri> Well, any programs.
[9:13] <AndrewPH> And if you're smart enough it's just a linux distro
[9:13] <AndrewPH> modify the source so you can
[9:13] <AndrewPH> and whatnot.
[9:14] <vurtual> the plot of half-life 2 is the plot of quake 2 guys
[9:14] <vurtual> you're a hero in space armor that's kinda obvious
[9:14] <AndrewPH> the plot of avatar is the plot of pocohauntes guise
[9:14] <Visiiri> vurtual is an OCD gaifag
[9:14] <vurtual> but you're fighting an oppressive world-conquering force, who conquers world after world
[9:15] <vurtual> they have no actual society anymore, and are merely a war machine
[9:15] <vurtual> their army consists of their enemies combined with technology, to create various, very inhuman weapons.

[9:16] <vurtual> The hero runs around and blows up all their important stuff.
[9:16] <Azathoth> what's your point?
[9:16] <Azathoth> the details are very different
[9:16] <Azathoth> not every story can be unique
[9:16] <Azathoth> or we'd have like 3 games
[9:16] <vurtual> The midpoint of the game is a large complex that serves to produce most of the alien forces, which you destroy, eventually allowing allied forces to support you in your quest
[9:17] <AndrewPH> vurtual, does it help that the source engine was based on the quake like 3 engine or summat
[9:17] <vurtual> Then, you eventually reach the massive capital of the enemy, fighting through their forces, and reaching their leader. who you chase down. Notable things include a teleporter in the puzzle, and a massive cliffhanger explosion.
[9:17] <Azathoth> quake 2
[9:18] <vurtual> quakeworld
[9:18] <vurtual> with, for no apparent reason, some quake 2 resources
[9:18] <vurtual> (computer beeps and random code and resources, and a stinger sound in half-life is a quake 2 song's start, but that's not really important)
[9:18] <AndrewPH> vurtual, actually in half life you're in the enemy's area the entire time minus like ravenholm and stuff
[9:18] <vurtual> quake 2 is that too
[9:19] <Shadaez> he's talking about HL1 I assume
[9:19] <vurtual> no, hl2.
[9:19] <Azathoth> vurtual, what the fuck is your point?
[9:19] <vurtual> I don't know

[9:19] <Drewseph> fuck
[9:19] <Drewseph> what if I drank the water O_O
[9:19] <vurtual> they make you forget
[9:19] <Drewseph> will I died?
[9:19] <vurtual> you won't even remember why you came here
[9:19] <Azathoth> another thing quake and half-life 2 have in common: guns
[9:19] <Azathoth> holy shit
[9:20] <vurtual> I think valve is doing this intentionally though
[9:20] * Drewseph lives in massachusetts in one of the effected towns for water contamination
[9:20] <Azathoth> i seriously doubt it
[9:20] <Visiiri> Portal has HL2 guns aswell.
[9:20] <Visiiri> But HL2 doesn't have portal guns :(
[9:20] <FireRat> Do i want to forward a range or ports or just 1?
[9:20] <vurtual> the original half-life is also similar to the first quake in plot by a small margin, you being a hero who is in a place that got invaded by ALIENS AND MONSTERS after a teleportation accident
[9:20] <Azathoth> WHOA ALIENS AND MONSTERS?
[9:20] <Azathoth> IN A VIDEO GAME?

[9:21] <vurtual> Azathoth, this is valve
[9:21] <Visiiri> omg
[9:21] <Visiiri> what
[9:21] <vurtual> They announced portal 2 by an obscure encoded sound, which gave you a bbs phone number
[9:21] <Visiiri> what if they're the same game
[9:21] <Visiiri> with different names
[9:21] <Visiiri> and nobody noticed
[9:21] <vurtual> then you had to use a modem to connect
[9:21] <Azathoth> so you're saying the entire half-life series was created just to troll everyone!?
[9:21] <vurtual> No, that they intentionally used the same basic plot concepts intentionally
[9:21] <Azathoth> by tricking them into replaying the quake series with different graphics?
[9:22] <Azathoth> oh
[9:22] <Azathoth> why would they do that?
[9:22] <Wervyn> Okay, that's freaking awesome and I don't care who knows it.
[9:22] <Shadaez> what is
[9:22] <vurtual> Valve likes to do screwy things
[9:22] <Wervyn> Got my RS decoder program working.
[9:23] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[9:23] <AndrewPH> Wervyn, pardon?
[9:23] <vurtual> the whole two-mission-pack style thing that both quake+quake 2, and half-life+half-life 2 follow is probably a coincidence. Though half-life has decay, which is 3, and half-life 2 will have ep3
[9:23] <Wervyn> Now I just need to optimize it so it doesn't take 20 seconds to decode 255 characters.

[9:37] <vurtual> valve is screwing with our heads
[9:37] <FoxtrotZero> nonono, he's relating Half Lifes one and two to Quakes one and two, because he's bloody paranoid.

[9:37] <Undead_Zeratul_> ?

[9:42] <Visiiri> Dump completed.
[9:43] <vurtual> now you feel bad for calling me paranoid eh
[9:43] <FoxtrotZero> No

[9:50] <FoxtrotZero> Kind of like the rest of your arguements?

[9:55] <vurtual> What kind of joystick?
[9:55] <vurtual> Plane one?
[9:55] <Shadaez> yeah
[9:55] <vurtual> IL-2 SWBF2(despite how lame flying is), FSX(I guess.)
[9:55] <FireRat> I've been to websites about how to do it but my port stil isnt open

[9:57] <vurtual> I'm ctrl+xing "a"
[9:57] <Roadcrosser> TYNT TRACER MIGHT BE ACTIVE
[9:57] <vurtual> secret of mana Visiiri
[9:57] <Roadcrosser> it detects what you copy and paste
[9:57] <vede> Some jerkass just joined my server and used an invalid character to crash all the clients.
[9:57] <Roadcrosser> and inserts its own text
[9:57] <Roadcrosser> meh
[9:57] <vurtual> it's not doing anything
[9:57] <vurtual> I don't have anything but "a"
[9:57] <Roadcrosser> you could do it to any irc connected server
[9:58] <Visiiri> Roadcrosser: You can do it on ANY server.
[9:58] <vurtual> also, I'm on linux
[9:58] <Yourself> vede: lolpwnt
[9:58] <Roadcrosser> i know
[9:58] <vurtual> how dos this exploit work.
[9:58] <vurtual> I ms use it.
[9:58] <vurtual> for .dat lulz
[9:58] <Yourself> sux
[9:58] <Roadcrosser> how do you type the character?
[9:59] <Visiiri> vede: What's your server?
[9:59] <Yourself> what character?
[9:59] <Visiiri> vede: If it's not multiworld, I want to join
[9:59] <Shadaez> vurtual any other games? preferably multiplayer
[9:59] <vede> vede's Towerworld (No hacks!)
[9:59] <vurtual> Shadaez, IL-2 is multiplayer
[9:59] <vurtual> it's pretty cool
[9:59] <vurtual> I've not actually played MP
[10:00] <Roadcrosser> I wonder why notch doesnt bother to add a invalid symbol blocker'
[10:00] <vurtual> Also technically FSX is multiplayer, and so is ArmA 2(which is why people play it)
[10:00] <Visiiri> lol, gotta download the creative client
[10:00] <vurtual> SWBF2 is also mp, and people also buy it for that reasno
[10:00] <Shadaez> anything less modern, and free :)
[10:00] <Shadaez> lol
[10:00] <Shadaez> or cheap.
[10:00] <vede> Roadcrosser, it's not that he isn't bothering to add it, it's just that he's not working on Creative till beta.
[10:00] <Yourself> probably the same reason he wrote the text rendering in such a way that it could crash
[10:00] <vurtual> SWBF2 is old, not modern, IL-2 old, not modern.
[10:01] <vurtual> Those are the only games I use a joystick for.
[10:01] <vurtual> :|
[10:01] <vurtual> If I knew others, I'd have bought them.
[10:01] <Shadaez> swbf = starwars battlefront?
[10:01] <vurtual> yeah
[10:01] <vurtual> it's got a limited fanbase, but a dedicated one
[10:01] <Shadaez> you should try allegience
[10:01] <vurtual> and shooting down everyone flawlesly in space battles is funny
[10:01] <Shadaez> http://www.freeallegiance.org/
[10:02] <vurtual> oh and I use my joystick for the hl2 mod "eternal silence" which is basically swbf2 space combat
[10:03] <vurtual> I don't trust games with "free" in their name much anymore
[10:03] <Shadaez> it's a really old game
[10:03] <Shadaez> 1999
[10:03] <Shadaez> very steep learning curve
[10:03] <vurtual> They're a dime-a-dozen backstabbin' waste of time, like mc
[10:03] <vurtual> no offense
[10:03] <vurtual> haaaaad to make that joke
[10:04] <Shadaez> well, check it out, it's a space combat game

[10:07] <vurtual> Oh hey, you know that thing where the demoman had blown up his parents when he lost his eye?
[10:07] <Shadaez> Hey, planetside is good.
[10:07] <FireRat> gawd port forwarding is so stupid... nothing freakin works. So freakin fruisterating
[10:07] <vurtual> Apparently, he was adopted. And his real parents retrieved him from an orphanage.
[10:08] <Shadaez> FireRat it just requires a brain
[10:08] <vurtual> "She, along with the Demoman's father, collected the young Tavish from the Crypt Grammar School for Orphans, revealing themselves as his true parents. They explained that he was abandoned at birth until his skills manifested themselves, a longstanding, cruel, and wholly unnecessary tradition among the Highland Demolition Men."
[10:08] <vurtual> FireRat, take a picture of the port forwarding menu you have
[10:08] <FireRat> I have a brain smart ass but I've never had to do it before
[10:08] <Shori> LOL
[10:08] <Roadcrosser> hahahaha
[10:08] <Shadaez> lol
[10:09] <Shadaez> just make sure you're forwarding to the correct internal IP
[10:09] <FireRat> I am forwarding to the correct one, I got a program and it did it auto
[10:09] <Shadaez> then, how do you know?
[10:10] <FireRat> I tried all the ip's that showed up on my router
[10:10] <Shadaez> Are you using a UPnP auto forwarding thing
[10:10] <FireRat> It's called Simple Port Forwardingh
[10:11] <Shadaez> just do it through the router
[10:11] <Shadaez> it may be hard the first time, but it's a nice skill to learn.
[10:11] <FireRat> i open the router
[10:11] <FireRat> go to games and apps
[10:12] <Shadaez> Games and apps?
[10:12] <Shadaez> Just goto port forwarding
[10:12] <FireRat> ya its where the ports are
[10:12] <FireRat> port forwarding is in that section
[10:12] <Shadaez> oh.
[10:13] <FireRat> i put in the port into in and out
[10:13] <FireRat> external and internal
[10:13] <FireRat> put in my comps ip
[10:13] <Shadaez> take a screenshot
[10:13] <FireRat> save
[10:13] <FireRat> and nothing..
[10:14] <Shadaez> okay, get us a screenshot and I will try to help more
[10:14] <FireRat> how do i send screen shots
[10:14] <FireRat> ?
[10:15] <Shadaez> upload it to imageshack.us

[11:48] <Yourself> only a matter of time, Azathoth

[11:50] <Christoph> I was considering getting it because its original title was buttmonkey.
[11:50] <Azathoth> i thought chrome sucked
[11:50] <Christoph> And I was curious as to why they had picked that name during developement.
[11:50] <vurtual> I thought it was a halo commercial Malikat
[11:50] <Azathoth> or did they fix it?
[11:50] <vurtual> or a ps3 commercial
[11:50] <Konogan> Shori, then who's god?
[11:50] <Azathoth> there is no god

[11:51] <Azathoth> they thought they ate babies
[11:51] <Shori> Jesus was a cool dude

[11:57] <vurtual> I dunno man that blurring out of their words, and then the angle-less overlay of the other words totally could've happened in real time on their signs, Azathoth.
[11:57] <Christoph> Actually, I remember a dutch friend of mine talking about how one of the political parties wanted to kick every muslim out of the Netherlands.
[11:57] <Christoph> They were gaining support, apparently.
[11:57] <Azathoth> hah, yep
[11:58] <vurtual> well yeah they're threatening to annihilate everyone
[11:58] <Azathoth> muslims? i just call em terrorists
[11:58] <vurtual> "everything about islam I learned on 9/11" guy has a point you know
[11:58] <vurtual> there's lots of terrorist ones
[11:58] <Christoph> Well, it would depend on how closely they follow the Quran to.
[11:58] <vurtual> and not-terrorist ones
[11:58] <Konogan> I mean, it look like a faked protestation...
[11:59] <vurtual> I don't think I've seen any outright terrorist protestants really. Or actual dictionary terrorist christans at all... are there any?
[11:59] <Azathoth> (jk btw)
[11:59] <Christoph> That's because they were around back during America's creation.
[11:59] <Azathoth> hey guys
[11:59] <vurtual> We always play CT anyways.
[11:59] <Christoph> Killing quakers for the crime of being quakers.
[11:59] <Azathoth> if i scan an iso with a virus scanner (avast, particularly), will it actually scan the contents?
[11:59] <Christoph> Etc.
[11:59] <vurtual> that's not... terrorism though.
[12:00] <vurtual> well we're getting better right guys
[12:00] <Christoph> Threatening people in order to force them to change religions?

[12:02] <vurtual> all of it.
[12:02] <Christoph> Nonsense.
[12:02] <Azathoth> the truth is religion does nothing but hold us back as a species
[12:02] <Azathoth> it impedes scientific progress
[12:02] <Christoph> It's not obsolete if it's what is important to you.
[12:02] <vurtual> The very reason I'm more or less pacafistic rather than murderous, is obsolete.
[12:02] <Azathoth> it causes needless conflict
[12:03] <Azathoth> and just promotes general retardation and superstition
[12:03] <vurtual> Azathoth, what about the guy who invented kevlar?
[12:03] <Christoph> However specific KINDS of religion is causing major problems in the world right now.
[12:03] <vurtual> The gatling gun?
[12:03] <vurtual> atom bombs!?

[12:03] <Yourself> it's possible that religion was mostly a by-product of other cognitive facilities that exist to help humans form relationships and societies and have an understanding of where they fit into a greater entity
[12:03] <Konogan> Religion deny you the knowledge.
[12:03] <vurtual> or that it's maybe true, but nobody believes that.
[12:03] <Shori> They were religious, except for Einstein, Vurtual.
[12:03] <Christoph> It's great to believe in pacifism.
[12:03] <vurtual> welp I'm off to do amazingly cool things bye guys
[12:03] <Konogan> XD
[12:04] <Christoph> Good luck, cool guy.
[12:04] <Christoph> Girl.
[12:04] <Christoph> Person.
[12:04] <Konogan> vurtual, don't pray too much.
[12:04] <Shadaez> You know, I hate how people aren't pro-choice. If you're christian and don't believe that peopel should abort, then choose not to, why choose for others?
[12:04] <Shori> man you guys are harsh
[12:04] <Shori> rofl
[12:04] <Konogan> :P
[12:04] <Konogan> One day he'll thank us.
[12:04] <Christoph> I doubt it.
[12:04] <Azathoth> people with faith in nonsense like to force their beliefs on others, shadaez
[12:04] <Konogan> XD
[12:04] <Christoph> We're not helping him feel better much right about now.
[12:05] <Seiseki> I wish that when they invented religion back in the day that they had included something about "when you die you get to relive the life of the people you've treated wrong" instead of the crap about hell, would surely make people act different
[12:05] <vurtual> I'm religious and all, but I'm pro-nuclear power, unwillingly pro-choice and freedom of speech and have been firmly believing that evolution should only be taught as a theory(it's just a theory. Even if it's fairly sound, it's still just a theory independent of things), and that religion shouldn't be forced on anyone
[12:05] <vurtual> except me when I was like, 5, so I didn't kill that guy.
[12:05] <Christoph> Well, some religions do teach "Do unto others..."
[12:05] <Azathoth> yeah but that message isn't followed very well, christoph
[12:05] <Shadaez> vurtual it is tought as a theory, what are you talking about
[12:05] <Konogan> I think religion was created mostly because of the fear of death.
[12:05] <vurtual> Shadaez, not as anyone acts around me
[12:06] <vurtual> They firmly put it as fact in my face
[12:06] <Seiseki> yeah, but still religious people have commited horrible crimes through the ages..
[12:06] <Christoph> I like that the Texas Board of Education wants the separation of Church and State removed from textbooks.
[12:06] <vurtual> everyone has
[12:06] <Shadaez> I don't think you understand scientific theories

[12:06] <Azathoth> i don't see how you could possibly prove evolution to be true, unless you were around for millions of years to actually observe it
[12:06] <Seiseki> yeah but they had religion as an excuse
[12:06] <Christoph> Well...
[12:06] <Azathoth> but it's as close to indisuptable as it gets
[12:06] <vurtual> The very limits of a theory, how we got where we are, and the fact that you shouldn't just go around firmly believing it no matter what seem to evade people
[12:06] <Christoph> There's that contagious cancer they found on the Tazmanian Devils.
[12:06] <Yourself> <Azathoth> i don't see how you could possibly prove evolution to be true, unless you were around for millions of years to actually observe it
[12:07] <Yourself> because it leaves all sorts of shit behind
[12:07] <vurtual> Always be skeptical, but friendly to new ideas.
[12:07] <vurtual> That's how you science, bro.
[12:07] <Azathoth> so what i'm saying is christians love to criticize the fact that it's called a THEORY
[12:07] <Seiseki> so the theory of how god created us is more logical than that of evolution?
[12:07] <Christoph> How do I shot science?
[12:07] <Azathoth> but that doesn't mean there isn't substantial evidence to back it up
[12:07] <Malikat> you can actually demonstrate evolution
[12:07] <Azathoth> one only has to look at a few fossil records to see it's a pretty fucking sound idea
[12:07] <Yourself> people criticize the word theory without actually knowing what it means
[12:07] <vurtual> Evolution on the small scale can't really be disputed without getting outright philosophical
[12:08] <Yourself> a theory is something which describes a set of facts
[12:08] <Konogan> Mmmh...
[12:08] <Azathoth> i don't understand how you could accept the idea of microevolution and then not think that macroevolution could happen
[12:08] <Yourself> explains, would be a better term
[12:08] <vurtual> but people will act like no matter what, their view is magically right in every way for no apparent reason, and will magically act like their view completely disproves mine in every way.

[12:09] <Rawer> do anyone play cod4 modern warfare 1 here?
[12:09] <Shadaez> vurtual I have no problem with your beliefs, you could easily believe every scientific hteory out there, and still be as religious as ever. I think the right way to do it is to think that "god made it that way".
[12:09] <Christoph> Not I, sir. Not I.
[12:09] <Azathoth> vurtual wtf are you talking about?
[12:09] <vurtual> I'm entirely fine with you criticising my beliefs back, and I'm entirely fine with having to hold things skeptically, and that it's entirely open to interpetation.
[12:09] <Rawer> i need someone to test my server :(
[12:09] <vurtual> Azathoth somehow, some far way back
[12:09] <Christoph> When people are asses about, it, though, that's the problem.

[12:11] <TW|Sleeping> implanted meaning what /you/ think
[12:11] <Christoph> As in, things taught to us that are impossible to change?

[12:12] <vurtual> I always get suspicious of things telling me to do silly stuff, too.
[12:12] <Shadaez> Are there any actual FSM churches?
[12:12] <Rooster> fart
[12:13] <vurtual> yes, Shadaez
[12:13] <Rooster> There should be
[12:13] <vurtual> and at least one gaming church
[12:13] <Rooster> Omg yes
[12:13] <Christoph> I've heard tell of a few.

[12:17] <Christoph> Yum.

[12:18] <Rooster> Why no lobster
[12:18] <Christoph> Then part of the religion.
[12:18] <Rooster> WHY?
[12:18] <Shori> Because Leviticus 11:10 bans it
[12:18] <Christoph> Prisoners used to complain about being fed lobster as meals, Rooster.
[12:19] <Shadaez> How about everyone just be a good person, and when you die you goto heaven if u arnt bad ? :3
[12:19] <Azathoth> no so much hypocisy as just plain contradiction
[12:19] <[JD]> common designer: God - creator of everything
[12:19] <Rooster> Christoph why?
[12:19] <Rooster> In today or in biblical times
[12:19] <Christoph> It was considered bad.

[12:19] <[JD]> it is?

[12:20] <Shori> I love Leviticus 15:19-20

[12:20] <Christoph> Crawfish are delicious little buggers.
[12:20] <Rooster> I'm agnostic

[12:23] <Shadaez> Christoph - yes, it is much better than an oven, quicker and less power consumed.
[12:23] <Azathoth> it's just that if someone were talking about minecraft, their conversation would take precedence
[12:23] <vurtual> rules 1 and 2 of #minecraft: talk about minecraft
[12:23] <vurtual> and don't talk about minecraft

[12:24] <Christoph> Has anyone seen that crazy-ass hexidecimal calculator those guys spent hundreds of hours making?
[12:24] <Yourself> yeah, i put you on ignore because, up until now, you never said anything i found interesting
[12:24] <Christoph> In minecraft?
[12:24] <Christoph> The thing is leviathan in proportions.
[12:24] <vurtual> well being unintersting is a given
[12:24] <Konogan> Seriously, I don't have the time to read everything >_<
[12:24] <Shori> Hexadecimal calc, eh?
[12:24] <Christoph> uses sand and water to create logic gates.
[12:24] <Konogan> So, brb.
[12:24] <Shori> is it on the forums
[12:24] <Christoph> A massive circuit board.
[12:24] <Azathoth> i'd have ignored vurtual too, if i knew how to do it before yesterday :P
[12:24] <Yourself> uninteresting isn't the only metric
[12:24] <Shadaez> i don't understand how that works
[12:24] <Shori> I've seen a binary adder
[12:24] <Christoph> Yeah, let me find the link.
[12:24] <Yourself> you also said a lot of stuff
[12:24] <vurtual> Yay I have a hate club.
[12:25] <Shori> Alrighty
[12:25] <vurtual> Haters gonna hate eh

[12:25] <Azathoth> but now i can't bring myself to do it
[12:25] <Konogan> Vurtual, I don't hate you :D
[12:25] <Azathoth> he's kinda cute in a strange way
[12:25] <vurtual> At least you don't try to stalk me even though I don't know you
[12:25] <Yourself> i just got tired of seeing you talking about pokemon or whatever
[12:25] <Konogan> anyway, BRB.
[12:25] <Shori> everyone is a hater in some regard, vurtual :p

[12:25] <Christoph> Hey now...
[12:25] <Christoph> Pokemon is a fine and gentlemanly thing to discuss.
[12:25] <vurtual> then fail horribly as nobody even gets what insane thing you're talking about.
[12:25] <Yourself> anyway, since we're back to where we were, back you go
[12:25] <vurtual> pokeymans?
[12:25] <Azathoth> it's just that you go on about stuff when nobody is listening a lot
[12:25] <Shori> Downloading, Christoph
[12:26] <Rooster> OMFG I'M GOING TO GET TO USE THE HAWX ADDONS
[12:26] <Christoph> Hm?
[12:26] <Christoph> Oh, right.
[12:26] <Rooster> GOT TO FUCKING GO
[12:26] <Christoph> Shit is crazy, though.
[12:26] <Shori> or just opening
[12:26] <Yourself> Azathoth, that sums it up pretty accurately
[12:26] <Christoph> I mean look at those pics.
[12:26] <UnknownX> Vurtual is hating on the haters

[12:26] <vurtual> I hate the haters hating the haters hating the haters.
[12:26] <Azathoth> like he'll be talking about JC2 to himself for 30 minutes while everyone else is talking about something completely different :P

[12:26] <vurtual> More like 5.
[12:27] <Christoph> It's like that xkcd
[12:27] <vurtual> My entire life I've only been able to get arguments out so fast.
[12:27] <Azathoth> and then he's liek ARRRGH QUAKE LIVE RAGE
[12:27] <Christoph> About the man who modeled the universe out of rocks.
[12:27] <vurtual> That's their next goal, Christoph.

[12:27] <vurtual> That's my fault
[12:28] <Azathoth> that kind of thing happens to me on a daily basis, yourself -_-

[12:28] <vurtual> should be done with the whole universe-sim up to the end of the big warp-tangles before mp.

[12:29] <vurtual> We need some oil sippy cups
[12:29] <Christoph> It would require something tantamount to the Improbability Drive.
[12:29] <Christoph> They say that spill might be the worst environmental disaster in US history.
[12:29] <Yourself> it would have to be a computer capable of simulating itself
[12:29] <vurtual> there's two now

[12:29] <Christoph> Nicccce.
[12:30] <Christoph> BP fucking up in every direction, eh?
[12:30] <vurtual> Yourself, maybe it can't handle those extra computations. So it can only simulate a universe without a universe inside it. Or each one is weaker by one level.
[12:30] <vurtual> then again you ignored me so screw you anyways
[12:30] <Yourself> there are bacteria that digest oil now
[12:30] <Christoph> Yep.
[12:30] <Yourself> and nylon, but that's not really useful here
[12:30] <Azathoth> they're going to evolve to eat flesh instead
[12:30] <vurtual> Dump them out, and then realise that things like nylon are really important
[12:30] <Azathoth> if you believe in that kind of thing, i mean
[12:30] <vurtual> so we just nuked the sea

[12:31] <Christoph> We have disease-eating fleshes as well.
[12:31] <Azathoth> that will eat your flesh before your eyes
[12:31] <Shori> wow
[12:31] <Christoph> Ooooh.
[12:32] <Azathoth> like a person falls into a vat of it, and they're gone
[12:32] <Christoph> Beat me to the punch, vurtual.
[12:32] <Azathoth> just bones left over
[12:32] <Yourself> if something evolved to do that, it wouldn't survive very long
[12:32] <Yourself> the quicker you kill your host, the quicker you have to spread to another

[12:33] <Azathoth> i wish someone would invent a zombie virus already
[12:33] <vurtual> so why do these diseases keep killing us
[12:33] <vurtual> and why do we keep fighting them
[12:33] <vurtual> why can't we just forcefully eject them?
[12:33] <Christoph> ...
[12:33] <vurtual> make them happy
[12:33] <vurtual> get them to leave us alone
[12:33] <Christoph> ...
[12:33] <Azathoth> what? how?
[12:33] <vurtual> then gather 2 of them on every boat and send tem into the sun
[12:34] <Yourself> well, i mentioned a virus the other day that was genetically engineered to alter the DNA in monkey eyes to create a new type of cone cell
[12:34] <Christoph> Two... diseases? or people with the diseases?
[12:34] <Yourself> enhancing their color vision
[12:34] <Azathoth> i wonder if some kind of zombie thing would even be possible
[12:34] <Christoph> The CDC does an excellent job of documenting and archiving various diseases no longer prevalent today.

[12:34] <Azathoth> and if it were, how would you stop the infected from eating each other?
[12:35] <vurtual> and win the biggest game of landgrab in history.
[12:35] <Yourself> depends on what symptoms constitute a zombie
[12:35] <Christoph> Several of them would fuck lots of us up if re-released into the streets.
[12:35] <Christoph> There is a disease,(I think it's called Toxoplasma Ghondii?) that controls animals behaviors.
[12:35] <vurtual> http://nukeitfromorbit.com/
[12:35] <Shori> holy shit this hex adder is neat
[12:35] <vurtual> If it's what I'm thinking of, it affects ants.
[12:35] <Azathoth> to me, it just needs to be violent, particularly bitey, contagious, and won't cause the host to kill other infected
[12:35] <Shori> XD
[12:35] <vurtual> Because they're simple ants
[12:36] <Shori> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=Cueball&id=1
[12:36] <Azathoth> it doesn't necessarily have to make them slow or literally undead
[12:36] <Christoph> There is also a disease that forces ants to climb to the tallest point so their heads can explode.
[12:36] <Yourself> toxoplasma gondii
[12:36] <Yourself> it's a parasite
[12:36] <vurtual> for ants
[12:36] <Christoph> I thought gondii was for mammals.
[12:36] <vurtual> who are yknow, weak to that kinda stuff
[12:36] <Yourself> it's hosts are usually cats
[12:36] <Yourself> its*
[12:36] <Christoph> Ach, there you go.
[12:36] <vurtual> oh no my cat is gonna get mee
[12:36] <vurtual> wait
[12:36] <vurtual> my cat ran off
[12:36] <Christoph> Half the people in the world have it already, right?
[12:36] <vurtual> disease stole my cat
[12:37] <Yourself> it doesn't usually do much to humans
[12:37] <vurtual> Wait... I sent my cat away?
[12:37] <Yourself> unless a pregnant woman gets it
[12:37] <Yourself> it can fuck up the fetus

[12:37] <vurtual> they're midichlorians
[12:37] <Yourself> it can also be bad if you're immunocompromised
[12:37] <vurtual> and they make you forcefully create horrible prequels
[12:38] <Yourself> toxoplasmosis is the disease that it causes
[12:38] <vurtual> The only force it gives you is the ability to force people to cooperate
[12:38] <Yourself> it can make rats attracted to the scent of cats
[12:38] <vurtual> nuke it from orbit
[12:38] <Yourself> rather than their typical response of being afraid
[12:38] <Christoph> Says gondii can take its asexual stages in any mammal.
[12:38] <Azathoth> i imagine the zombie virus might be related to rabies or something
[12:38] * Ausfriend (davidsawic@220-244-127-48.static.tpgi.com.au) Quit (Quit: Ausfriend)
[12:39] <Christoph> You mean like the L4D virus which is essentially just rabies?
[12:39] <Azathoth> or some kind of similar disease that fucks with your brain, removing your inhibition to not kill people or something
[12:39] <Christoph> With very specific results?
[12:39] <Azathoth> but it would also have to make you basically braindead so you're not just a psychopath

[12:40] <vurtual> back in episode
[12:40] <vurtual> 1
[12:40] <Azathoth> because if zombies just attacked each other, it would be a very short lived outbreak
[12:40] <vurtual> Azathoth, adrenaline
[12:40] <vurtual> Also l4d zombies attack eachother.
[12:40] <Azathoth> rarely
[12:40] <vurtual> when idle
[12:40] <Christoph> They fight each other occasionally.
[12:40] <Azathoth> well they need to have something to attract them to the uninfected
[12:40] <vurtual> if you didn't get hordes swarming you, they'd probably clear themselves out after a while.
[12:41] <Christoph> They actively seek out non-infected individuals when given the opportunity.
[12:41] <vurtual> ...bad one liners
[12:41] <Shori> oops 8D
[12:41] <Shori> crashed MC
[12:41] <Azathoth> i suppose the virus itself could evolve that out of necessity for spreading
[12:41] <Shori> with the hex adder
[12:41] <Yourself> seeing as zombies aren't real, i'm surprised anyone can say exactly what it is that they do
[12:41] <vurtual> good one liners will allow the heroes to live.
[12:41] <Christoph> They would either starve to death or the virus would do something crazy to their bodies to survive.
[12:41] <Azathoth> yourself, you CAN define what they should do in order to be considered zombies
[12:41] <vurtual> Wait, zombies are real?
[12:41] <vurtual> aren't*
[12:41] <Yourself> yeah, i asked you that earlier
[12:41] <vurtual> ...what have I been shooting every day?
[12:41] <Yourself> and you either never answered, or i wasn't looking
[12:41] <Christoph> Since it's been shown the virus is capable of rapidly changing physiology to suit different methods.
[12:42] <Christoph> Zombies ARE real.
[12:42] <Azathoth> you weren't looking
[12:42] <vurtual> okay, have I been shooting zombies though?
[12:42] <Azathoth> i said they have to be aggressively violent, have the urge to bite people, and be attracted to the uninfected
[12:42] <Christoph> They are people who have been poisoned and are now functionally retarded.
[12:42] <Azathoth> oh, and it should be contagious
[12:42] <Yourself> so i wasn't
[12:42] <Christoph> Err, mentally.
[12:42] <Azathoth> because if you're missing any of those things, then they're not really zombies...
[12:42] <Christoph> They are extremely passive, and are open to suggestion.
[12:42] <vurtual> http://xkcd.com/734/
[12:42] <vurtual> Azathoth:
[12:42] <Azathoth> but zombies don't necessarily have to shamble about or be dead
[12:43] <Christoph> They are the voodoo zombies.

[12:43] <Azathoth> voodoo zombies are bullshit
[12:43] <vurtual> As long as it's not the "man" then it's okay to believe right guys
[12:43] <Azathoth> they rely on the assumption that there is magic everywhere in this bitch

[12:44] <Christoph> Voodoo zombies are real people.

[12:48] <Christoph> Hm.
[12:48] <Christoph> This is interesting because it's odd.
[12:48] <vurtual> I am very capible of physically reading that you use logic, Azathoth, it's quite useful a skill right?
[12:48] <Christoph> And I didn't expect to be antagonized for something as esoteric as voodoo powder.

[12:51] <Christoph> The way voodoo powder works is that it slows the victims body down to a death-like state. They're pronounced dead, then buried. Hours later they're dug up by the people who poisoned them. Their brains have suffered damage from oxygen depletion.
[12:51] <Shori> idk Azathoth
[12:51] <Shori> Voodoo Too is a good song
[12:51] <vurtual> Christoph, you've allllready lost.
[12:51] <Azathoth> wat
[12:51] <Christoph> Lost?
[12:51] <Azathoth> i'm talking about graphics cards
[12:51] <Christoph> I wasn't aware we were competing.
[12:52] <Shori> o
[12:52] <vurtual> We aren't
[12:52] <vurtual> But you lost.
[12:52] <Christoph> Is there a prize?
[12:52] <vurtual> It's like co-op
[12:52] <vurtual> losing is when you lose.
[12:52] <Shori> You know what
[12:52] <Shori> You just lost the game.
[12:52] <Christoph> Are you sure?
[12:52] <Azathoth> oh god
[12:52] <vurtual> Nobody else may have actually won yet(we did in this instance), but you lost.
[12:52] <Christoph> I'm pretty sure there should be a prize.
[12:52] <Azathoth> the game is almost as lame as your mom D:
[12:52] <Christoph> I mean seriously.
[12:52] <vurtual> hahahah
[12:52] <Konogan> Lol, I remember my first video card, a Voodoo FX XD
[12:52] <Shori> I agree, Azathoth
[12:52] <vurtual> The prize is being taken seriously
[12:52] <Christoph> If someone wins, they should win a chocolate medal or something.
[12:52] <Konogan> I played Rayman 2 on it :D
[12:52] <Shori> but how absurd Vurtual and Christoph are both being is amusing
[12:52] <Shori> :P
[12:52] <MarkTraceur> Hey now, I like Shori's mom
[12:52] <Christoph> How are you supposed to be taken seriously without a medal?
[12:53] <vurtual> I'm not absurd.

[12:54] <MarkTraceur> Shori: Where do you think she got it?
[12:54] <vurtual> My leg muscles look way bigger than they should for the size of my body.
[12:54] <Shori> My step-fa-
[12:54] <Shori> ..LOL
[12:54] <MarkTraceur> Hehehe
[12:54] <Konogan> I would love being a monk that live deep in the wild making handicrafts <3.
[12:54] <Christoph> Perhaps you should let them atrophy.
[12:54] <Malikat> no, shori
[12:54] <Malikat> i AM your step father
[12:54] <Shori> oshi
[12:54] <Christoph> You know, ride around in a wheel chair for a while.
[12:54] <vurtual> Slow forged for generations in the bowels of captured English kings, Christoph?
[12:54] <MarkTraceur> Bringin' it right back to Vader
[12:55] <Christoph> Surely you jest, sir.
[12:55] <Christoph> The e.coli cells would poison anyone foolish enough to eat said confections.
[12:55] <vurtual> I do not jest when I have a claymore.
[12:55] <vurtual> I joust.
[12:55] <Shori> you don't joust with swords
[12:55] <Shori> >:|
[12:55] <vurtual> I do.
[12:55] <Christoph> You joust with a claymore while others use ostriches.
[12:55] <Shori> Get a lance or GTFO
[12:55] <Malikat> i joust with LASER SWORDS
[12:56] * MalkSticks (chatzilla@114-30-108-150.ip.adam.com.au) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.3/20100401080539])
[12:56] <vurtual> By riding a bullet train, then jump off and hold it high into the air, pointing the balde down and forward
[12:56] <Christoph> Height shall determine the victor here.
[12:56] <vurtual> Then, as I'm about to hit their shoulders, I thrust forward, causing a sonic boom, slicing them clean in half with the supersonic blade.
[12:56] <Shori> Ahahaha
[12:56] <Malikat> Christoph i love that game
[12:56] <Christoph> He who rides the tallest bird shall be the victor of JOUST
[12:56] <Konogan> I joust with my di-- Oh well, NVM that.
[12:56] <Christoph> It is a great game, isn't it?
[12:56] <vurtual> Then my feet hit their shoulders, generating enough force to send the halves apart.
[12:57] <Christoph> And then you smear across the ground from jumping out of a moving train?
[12:57] <vurtual> I shoot through the planet, and launch out of china, wearing their head-halves as pauldrons.
[12:57] <Christoph> Oh, wait, I missed the part about the sonic boom.
[12:57] <Christoph> Sounds expensive.
[12:57] <Malikat> MORE LIKE SPAULDERS
[12:58] <Konogan> Spauldrons!
[12:58] <Konogan> ...
[12:58] <Konogan> Nvm.
[12:58] * Christoph rubs his neck.
[12:58] <vurtual> Then I fly into the sun, shooting through, burning off any trace of their flesh on me, before using my sword to guide myself into a curve, hooking around the other end, and sending myself back.
[12:58] * vurtual (vurtual@74.206.62.26) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[12:59] <Christoph> Hoorah.
[12:59] <Konogan> Vurtual, Like a bawss.
[12:59] <Azathoth> wat
[12:59] <Christoph> It worked.
[12:59] <Azathoth> go back to final fantasy, faggot
[12:59] * vurtual (vurtual@74.206.62.26) has joined #minecraft
[12:59] <vurtual> WHY DID MY CLIENT JUTS DO THAT
[12:59] <Christoph> Darn.
[12:59] <Christoph> Did not work well enough.
[12:59] <Azathoth> that reminds me of sephiroth's epic attack
[12:59] <Christoph> Need to practice that.
[12:59] <Malikat> you were too bad ass for IRC
[12:59] <Konogan> Lol.
[13:00] <vurtual> Anyways any time you see meteor shower, it's their glowing-hot flesh chunks flying in with me, which have been coated with iron in the core of the sun.
[13:00] <vurtual> UFO sightings on cows are me practicing.
[13:00] <Konogan> "Bad ass level too high! shutting down to prevent division by 0!" *crash*
[13:00] <Christoph> Hmm.
[13:01] <vurtual> At this rate I'l probably be every meteological event out there.
[13:01] <vurtual> meteorogical?
[13:01] <Azathoth> i think this is it:
[13:01] <vurtual> space-weathery-thing.
[13:01] <Azathoth> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g7cKlJntsw
[13:01] <Azathoth> quite possibly the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen in a video game ever
[13:01] <Shori> yes
[13:01] <Shori> very much so
[13:02] <Konogan> Indeed.
[13:02] <Christoph> Does it break all the planets every time it's cast?
[13:02] <vurtual> So powerful, the equations of the laws of physics have to manifest themselves in a subserif font.
[13:02] <Azathoth> apparently
[13:02] <Shori> yes
[13:02] <Christoph> Wowee!
[13:02] <Azathoth> hell.....
[13:02] <Azathoth> are they trying to save the world or something in ff7?
[13:02] <Shadaez> lol
[13:02] <Azathoth> because apparently, they aren't doing much good
[13:02] <Konogan> XD
[13:03] <Konogan> Hey what?
[13:03] <Shadaez> it's funny how terrible that looks.
[13:03] <vurtual> Oh no he blew up juptier and destroyed the sun.
[13:03] <Christoph> It IS pretty bad...
[13:03] <Konogan> The story of FF7 isn't on earth???
[13:03] <Azathoth> apparently it is, konogan :\
[13:03] <Konogan> why do all the freaking system is the same?
[13:03] <Konogan> What?
[13:03] <Azathoth> it shows saturn, jupiter, and mercury
[13:03] <Konogan> Really?
[13:04] <Azathoth> (and labels them too)
[13:04] * Konogan starts googling...
[13:04] <Christoph> It does.
[13:04] <Christoph> Ow.
[13:04] <Azathoth> and venus
[13:04] <Christoph> The skin under my tongue is raw.
[13:04] <vurtual> so wait you have to fight him in space?
[13:04] <vurtual> to what sounds like a flute playing the medal of honor theme
[13:05] <Azathoth> no, i think they're fighting him on the planet, but he does this epic attack to destroy the solar system just to damage them
[13:05] <Christoph> Personally, I never enjoyed FF7.
[13:05] <Azathoth> i never played it that far
[13:05] <Christoph> I found it uninteresting.
[13:05] <Azathoth> because i realized i hate weeaboo games
[13:05] <Shadaez> I loved it when I was ~12
[13:05] <Christoph> Now, a mamoswine, on the other hand.
[13:05] <Shadaez> then my sve got erased
[13:05] <Christoph> I can get behind something like that.
[13:06] <vurtual> I thought of this for some reason: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2FkuE4eS0Q
[13:06] <vurtual> which is a pretty awesome to think of for no reason
[13:06] <Konogan> Weird. the system is the same but: "The world of Final Fantasy VII, referred to in the game as "The Planet", but retroactively named "Gaia"".
[13:06] <Christoph> You just said the reason mang.
[13:06] <Christoph> You said it sounded like Medal of Honor.
[13:06] <vurtual> well yeah
[13:07] <Azathoth> well gaia is the greek goddess of the earth
[13:07] <Azathoth> and stuff
[13:07] <Konogan> Yeah but..
[13:07] <vurtual> the events of VII destroyed all pantheons
[13:07] <Azathoth> it's probably losely based on earth
[13:07] <Christoph> You know what RPG I enjoyed the hell out of?
[13:07] <Azathoth> but japanese people are funky like that
[13:07] <vurtual> setting way for the sci-fi final fantasy games
[13:07] <vurtual> what's with those, the sci-fi ones
[13:07] <Christoph> Golden Sun.
[13:07] <Christoph> One and Two.
[13:08] <vurtual> no man secret of mana, best rpg.
[13:08] <Azathoth> no man
[13:08] <Christoph> ARgh, no.
[13:08] <Azathoth> cccccchrono trigger
[13:08] <vurtual> screw chrono trigger it's turn based
[13:08] <Christoph> Mana games are ok.
[13:08] <Christoph> OK.
[13:08] <Azathoth> but chrono trigger had the best music ever
[13:08] <Christoph> But not the best.
[13:08] <vurtual> I have not liked turn based games
[13:08] <Azathoth> and the time travel stuff was epic
[13:08] <Furyhunter> I enjoyed Chrono Trigger, it's just so hard to navigate
[13:08] <vurtual> especially after the mario RPG ones.
[13:08] <vurtual> TAP A TO NOT DIE
[13:08] <vurtual> EVERY TURN
[13:08] <Furyhunter> FF7 was boring as well to me
[13:08] <vurtual> Then tap A to not accidentally kill yourself attacking!
[13:08] * pontusedberg (Mibbit@c83-253-234-103.bredband.comhem.se) has joined #minecraft
[13:08] <Christoph> Super Mario RPG is one of the best RPG's I've ever played, sir.
[13:08] <Furyhunter> FF6 is easily one of my favorite games
[13:09] <vurtual> mostly the later ones
[13:09] <Azathoth> what vurtual?
[13:09] <Christoph> As such, I must challenge you to a dual.
[13:09] <vurtual> the thousand year door a bit
[13:09] <Azathoth> in turn based games, you don't need to just tap a
[13:09] <vurtual> and then the handheld mario rpgs
[13:09] <Konogan> Seriously, I never finished any RPG..
[13:09] <pontusedberg> Hello!
[13:09] <Christoph> That one was pretty ok.
[13:09] <Azathoth> because they stop when your turn comes around :|
[13:09] <vurtual> You have to press A or B or X or Y every attack
[13:09] <Azathoth> or at least you could set it to do so in chrono trigger
[13:09] <vurtual> and some of the bosses are ridiculously hard for no reason.
[13:09] <Christoph> They are hard because they are bosses, bro-ham.
[13:09] <Azathoth> chrono trigger had interesting combat. most of the normal baddies only took a few hits
[13:10] <Azathoth> it wasn't like ff6 or something where every combat was boring as fuck
[13:10] <vurtual> Christoph, unless you preform a sequence of events that's not even clear in the most clear guides, you die automatically
[13:10] <Christoph> Nonsense.
[13:10] <vurtual> There's one which is already ridiculously tough, then it just gets bigger, and has more attacks, extra health
[13:10] <vurtual> and then has a laser beam attack
[13:10] <Azathoth> i only had trouble with one chrono triggger boss that i had to look up
[13:10] <Konogan> No, I did finish a RPG... Do pokemon gold/silver count as RPGs?
[13:10] <Christoph> I'm not sure which you're referring to.
[13:10] <vurtual> it's in a ds one
[13:10] <vurtual> partners in time
[13:10] <Christoph> Oh, hey, I enjoyed that one.
[13:11] <Christoph> I don't remember if I finished it.
[13:11] <vurtual> If you don't preform a specific event(which is very hard to trigger in any situation, as it's mostly random) within 3-4 turns, you die instantly. And then you have to keep making it happen to not insta die.
[13:11] <Christoph> I probably got distracted and forgot about it.
[13:11] <Azathoth> alright, well goodnight fags
[13:11] <vurtual> he's fought in the fancy star-place
[13:11] <vurtual> hey Azathoth
[13:11] <Azathoth> <3 vurtual
[13:11] <Azathoth> wat
[13:11] <Christoph> ...
[13:11] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzDs4HHh96g
[13:11] <Christoph> Right.
[13:11] <vurtual> it's also sleep music
[13:12] <vurtual> and rapes my speakers apparently
[13:12] <Christoph> I blame all those secrets you kids bandy about these days.
[13:12] <Azathoth> not as good as chrono trigger's
[13:12] <Christoph> With your swords and whatnot.
[13:12] <Azathoth> ct music gets me fuckin pumped
[13:12] <vurtual> Secret of Mana has some pretty awesome music
[13:13] <Azathoth> i never actually played som
[13:13] <Christoph> I recall a game from a long time ago.
[13:13] <vurtual> and like 40% of the game was cut out
[13:13] <Christoph> Called Illusion of Gaia.
[13:13] <Quatroking> I really like the Super Smash Bros. Brawl OST
[13:13] <vurtual> pffft
[13:13] <Christoph> It was a live action RPG.
[13:13] <Quatroking> its a huge collection of well-known game tunes, but in motherfucking orchestra
[13:13] <vurtual> the upper land theme, boss fight music, final boss
[13:13] <Christoph> err.
[13:13] <Christoph> Not live action.
[13:13] <Azathoth> lol
[13:13] <vurtual> Quatroking, some of them are pretty... bad.
[13:13] <Azathoth> live action video games would be awesome
[13:13] <vurtual> Some of them are so bad we don't play the wario ware stage

[13:13] <Christoph> I do enjoy the orchestral versions in that game.
[13:14] <Quatroking> vurtual: some are really awesome
[13:14] <Konogan> Azathoth, what?
[13:14] <vurtual> Great, I'll get my stuff, Azathoth.
[13:14] <vurtual> NO YOUR SWORD IS ENOUGH okay okay okay
[13:14] <Azathoth> they need to invent a way to make live action video games!
[13:14] <Konogan> You mean... CDOs?
[13:14] <Azathoth> no
[13:14] <Christoph> Live actions games would be like that movie.
[13:14] <Christoph> Players, was it?
[13:14] <Christoph> Gamers?
[13:14] <Christoph> Something like that.
[13:14] <Konogan> Yeah.
[13:14] <Konogan> Gamers, if I recall.
[13:14] <Azathoth> gamer
[13:15] <Quatroking> isn't Gamer that shitty movie
[13:15] <Azathoth> yea
[13:15] <vurtual> yeah
[13:15] <Konogan> Yup.
[13:15] <Azathoth> with leonidas in it
[13:15] <Quatroking> its shitty
[13:15] <vurtual> Spartaaaaaans
[13:15] <vurtual> prepare to fight
[13:15] <vurtual> 3, 2, 1, FIGHT
[13:15] <Konogan> What was that other movie with leonnidas?
[13:15] <Christoph> Ohey.
[13:15] <Azathoth> 300?
[13:15] * Dae is now known as ZzZ|Dae
[13:15] <Christoph> I forgot I was debugging this.
[13:15] <vurtual> 2 kills in 2 seconds, excellent. excellent. excellent. excellent. excellent. excellent. excellent. excellent. excellent. excellent.
[13:16] <vurtual> Then at the end it's like, "HUMILIATION" with the spear
[13:16] <vurtual> the end
[13:16] <Christoph> What about the arrows?
[13:16] <vurtual> They all had battle shields.
[13:16] <Azathoth> i think gamer had potential
[13:16] * Chris220 (Chris@cpc3-farn7-2-0-cust104.know.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[13:16] <Azathoth> but it turned out just being too...
[13:16] <Azathoth> american
[13:16] <Christoph> I seem to recall a pile of spartans pricked like pincushions by the end of the movie.
[13:16] <Azathoth> know what i mean?
[13:16] <Konogan> Vurtual, he just wanted to hurt Xerxes to show that he is mortal...
[13:16] <Shadaez> you gusy are boying
[13:16] <Shadaez> you guys are boring*
[13:17] <Azathoth> you're obying
[13:17] <Azathoth> boying*
[13:17] <Shadaez> we should all play something :3
[13:17] <Christoph> Hm.
[13:17] <vurtual> you know that in quake, a melee kill is a "humiliation", right?
[13:17] <vurtual> and that I'm referring to how he hit him with a spear?
[13:17] <Azathoth> strip poker?
[13:18] <Azathoth> wait wut
[13:18] <Christoph> I wish there were more monster hunter games that were portable.
[13:18] <Azathoth> i said goodnight like 10 minutes ago
[13:18] <Azathoth> why the fuck am i still here?
[13:18] <vurtual> Anyways if any of you insist that your favorite game has the best music, then I require you to listen to Wild Fields/Into the Thick of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33d6EK2HykM
[13:18] <Christoph> Oh, wait, were you talking to me?
[13:18] <Azathoth> chrono trigger isn't my favorite game
[13:18] <Azathoth> but it makes me nostalgia like a motherfucker
[13:18] <Konogan> Oh wait! I remember that other movie with Leonnidas!
[13:18] <Konogan> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197624/
[13:19] <Azathoth> because nostalgia is a verb. don't even try to argue
[13:19] <vurtual> law abiding engineer?
[13:19] <Konogan> Have you guys seen it?
[13:19] <Konogan> XD
[13:19] <Azathoth> yes
[13:19] <Christoph> That was very well done.
[13:19] <Konogan> Yeah.
[13:19] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjGrHBpfqCo
[13:19] <Christoph> I was impressed with how well they synced the characters.
[13:19] <Azathoth> law abiding citizen was pretty boring. i fell asleep -_-
[13:19] <Christoph> I really wanted to go see...
[13:20] <Christoph> What was it?
[13:20] <Christoph> Man...
[13:20] <vurtual> the new pokemon movie?
[13:20] <Christoph> Well, I'd watch it if it was on TV.
[13:20] <Christoph> But no.
[13:20] <Christoph> It was...
[13:20] <Christoph> Urgh...
[13:20] <vurtual> At least you're honest.
[13:21] <Azathoth> that aint no pokemon
[13:21] <Azathoth> that's a chinese myth dragon!
[13:21] <vurtual> oh nos \o\
[13:21] <Christoph> Why would I not be honest?
[13:21] <vurtual> because some people try to act like they didn't like pokemon
[13:21] <Shadaez> Christoph really? you wish there were more MH games that WERE portable?
[13:21] <Christoph> I have the PSP version.
[13:21] <vurtual> there are lots of portable mh games
[13:21] <vurtual> IT'S CRAZY POPULAR IN JAPAN
[13:21] <pontusedberg> brains?
[13:21] <Azathoth> i wasn't really exposed to pokemanz until i was too old to like it
[13:22] <Christoph> I'm well aware of its popularity in japan.
[13:22] <vurtual> Azathoth:
[13:22] <vurtual> You aren't too old to like it
[13:22] <Azathoth> yes
[13:22] <Azathoth> it's shit
[13:22] <vurtual> no
[13:22] <vurtual> I still play it :|
[13:22] <Christoph> What I should have said is that I wish I had MORE of the portable MH games.
[13:22] <vurtual> It's like, when you're a kid, you'e like POKEYMON
[13:22] <Shadaez> well, there's 3 of tem, and a fourth coming out, for PSP
[13:22] <Azathoth> although i did have one of the games for gba when i was a kid, and it was pretty cool
[13:22] <Azathoth> err
[13:22] <Azathoth> gbc*
[13:22] <vurtual> and then you're the only kid who likes pokemon, and then everyone's like "wtf you like pokemon?"
[13:22] <vurtual> Then by the time you reach college you're like POKEMON!
[13:22] <Konogan> The fourth need to have targeting >_<
[13:23] <Christoph> I have Freedom Unite.
[13:23] <vurtual> Becuase everyone likes pokemon.
[13:23] <vurtual> Even ruby wasn't too bad.
[13:23] <vurtual> Then d/p got too silly for most people
[13:23] <Shadaez> Anyone have MH tri?
[13:23] <Christoph> I wasn't aware there was another english portable one out.
[13:23] <Azathoth> but i never liked the shit card game
[13:23] <gdude2002> d/p?
[13:23] <Azathoth> or the tv show
[13:23] <Christoph> I picked up tri last week.
[13:23] <vurtual> the tv show oh come on
[13:23] <vurtual> I wanna be, the very best
[13:23] <gdude2002> lol
[13:23] <Azathoth> dear god
[13:23] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbhbLrSQKyY
[13:24] <Konogan> AHHH! Damn! Nostalgia!
[13:24] <Azathoth> fuck
[13:24] <Christoph> Wow.
[13:24] <vurtual> that noone ever was. To catch them is my real test, to train them is my cause. I will travel, accross the land, searching faaar and wiiide, these pokemon to understand, the power that's insiiiide!
[13:24] <Christoph> There are a LOT of psp Monster Hunters.
[13:24] <Azathoth> you should see my local comic book/gaming store on pokemon tournament days
[13:24] <Konogan> Azathoth, same but me it's more MTG :P
[13:24] <Azathoth> it's a mob of at least 50 middle aged fatasses and 12 year olds
[13:24] <Azathoth> the whole store stinks like shit
[13:24] <Christoph> I did not know that.
[13:25] <Azathoth> and it's like that with magic too

[13:25] <Konogan> Well... Kinda.
[13:25] <Azathoth> i've gone to a few magic events, but i'm embarrassed to admit it :P
[13:25] <vurtual> Pokemon, (gotta catch 'em all), it's you and me, I know it's our destiiiny.
[13:26] <Konogan> I didn't participate in any event cause I feel I would get my ass kicked.
[13:26] <Azathoth> but usually i have to contend with the CCG players when i'm trying to get in a game of 40k

[13:26] <Christoph> I wanted to buy some.
[13:27] <Azathoth> it's expensive -_-
[13:27] <Christoph> Then I found Dawn of War.
[13:27] <Christoph> It is.
[13:27] <Azathoth> and the reason i'm in thousands of moneys of debt :D
[13:27] <Christoph> That's why I decided to stick with DoW.
[13:27] <Konogan> Never played 40K...
[13:27] <vurtual> I have a friend who is going to play warhammer

[13:28] <Christoph> He always had figures drying on a box on his dresser.
[13:28] <Roadcrosser> too much portal...
[13:29] <Roadcrosser> and im hungry
[13:29] <Shadaez> I like pokemon
[13:29] <Azathoth> they don't take long to dry...
[13:29] <Konogan> BRB.
[13:29] <Azathoth> unless he was using shit paint
[13:29] <Azathoth> oh, or you mean the glue
[13:29] * Christoph shrugs.
[13:29] <vurtual> Will your courage pull you through, Shadaez?
[13:29] <Christoph> I didn't ask.
[13:29] <Azathoth> i've got like 3 shelves full of miniatures. and that's not even half my collection ><
[13:30] <vurtual> I don't have enough physical nerdy stuff
[13:30] <Azathoth> they're all unpainted too
[13:30] <vurtual> I have lots and lots of legos around but... still.
[13:30] <Azathoth> i'd be a badass and totally get tons of pussy if they were actually painted and badass looking
[13:30] <vurtual> Azathoth, paint them.
[13:30] <vurtual> Slowly, and detailed-ly
[13:30] <Azathoth> heh
[13:30] <Azathoth> we're talking thousands of hours of painting
[13:30] <Azathoth> i don't know if i'll ever finish
[13:30] <vurtual> so?
[13:30] <Azathoth> because i'm constantly acquiring more
[13:30] <vurtual> use a 3D modelling program to give them all fictional squad markings.
[13:31] <Azathoth> i freehand some squad markings on my imperial guard units
[13:31] <vurtual> Then when someone else is just being lame, you have space marines that have stylized eagle wings covering their armor, in detail.

[13:31] <Azathoth> fuck space marines
[13:31] <vurtual> And full military ranks, each one having a whole name on their unit.
[13:31] <Azathoth> 40k space marines are lame
[13:31] <Shadaez> nerds
[13:32] <Azathoth> fuck off shadaez >_>
[13:32] <vurtual> Like, a full name, written on them incredibly tiny.
[13:32] <Shadaez> lol, im just kidding
[13:32] <Azathoth> vurtual, some people actually do that
[13:32] <vurtual> Or even better, manually sculpt detailed figures yourself.
[13:32] <Shadaez> change your name to virtual the spelling bothers me
[13:32] <Azathoth> i saw this really awesome space marine army once where the person named every marine, gave each marine unique heraldry stuff, and even wrote backstories for all of the sergeants and stuff. it was ridiculous
[13:33] <vurtual> That are articulate, requiring high strength and very tiny tweezers, each a unique face.
[13:33] <Christoph> The space marine books are insane.
[13:33] <Christoph> I've read several.
[13:33] <Christoph> They are all utterly insane.
[13:33] <vurtual> Azathoth, does your mind ever wander, or do you just get random ideas?
[13:33] <Shadaez> it is super nerdy though. There's a game works (worx?) by the theatre I goto, and it's terrible in there
[13:33] <Azathoth> like i said, i don't really like 40k space marines. they're ridiculous
[13:33] <Christoph> Both in the scope of how many things they kill, and how long they last killing them.
[13:34] <Azathoth> vurtual, wat?
[13:34] <vurtual> Thsoe people think about backstories.
[13:34] <vurtual> then they write them down, and then they have suddenly a huge amount of backstory
[13:34] <Azathoth> i mean i do that too, but not the extent that i'll plan one out for every important character
[13:35] <Christoph> I think at least a few would take time out of the day to specifically write for it.
[13:35] <vurtual> http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20061108
[13:35] <Christoph> People who fancy themselves as writers, perhaps.
[13:35] <vurtual> see also
[13:35] <Azathoth> the thing about space marines, christoph, is that they are basically comic book superheroes
[13:35] <Azathoth> in armor
[13:35] <vurtual> also that APC looks faintly like the one from advance wars
[13:36] <Azathoth> only their only real power is super strength and toughness

[13:36] <vurtual> I always liked the tau whatever they were, because every time I saw a picture of them, it was awesome. and that they were called "tau"
[13:36] <Azathoth> those are space marines vs tau in that CAD comic
[13:36] <vurtual> and tau cannons are also cool
[13:36] <vurtual> cool by association
[13:36] <Christoph> Well, there's also the guns that shoot massive explosive rounds.
[13:36] <Christoph> The regeneration.
[13:36] <Azathoth> the APC is a landraider, the toughest vehicle in the game
[13:36] <Christoph> Ability to go into stasis.
[13:37] <Christoph> Immunity to all but the deadliest toxins.
[13:37] <Azathoth> yeah
[13:37] <Christoph> Now that I think about it, they're kind of like wolverine, aren't they?

[13:37] <Christoph> This one story I read: a marine gets bitten by a snake during training.
[13:37] <Azathoth> they have tons of cybernetic implants
[13:37] <Christoph> His body stores the venom in his glands.

[13:37] <Azathoth> they basically have all their organs replaced
[13:38] <Christoph> later*
[13:38] <Christoph> They have extra hearts.
[13:38] <Christoph> Third lungs.
[13:38] <vurtual> and then wolvereine... invader zim
[13:38] <Christoph> Extra things no one has ever even heard of.
[13:38] <bildramer> back

[13:38] <bildramer> so I procrastinated through the first week of Ludum Dare

[13:38] <Christoph> Genetic... things that are used to carry on their genes after they die.
[13:38] <bildramer> ;_;
[13:38] <Azathoth> i thought ludum dare was 48 hours
[13:38] <Azathoth> oh
[13:38] <Azathoth> the geneseed
[13:39] <Azathoth> never really made much sense to me
[13:39] <Christoph> The way I understood it, it's an honor thing.
[13:39] <Christoph> A way of carrying on the path.
[13:39] <Christoph> But at the same time.

[13:40] <Christoph> The Imperial guard take losses so casually.
[13:40] * UltimateBudgie is now known as AFK_UltimateBudgie
[13:40] <Christoph> Average survival time for a soldier is, what, 18 hours?
[13:40] <Azathoth> i know. they're awesome
[13:40] <Azathoth> throw more men at it!
[13:40] <Azathoth> that's their philosophy
[13:40] <Christoph> The thing is, once they're properly upgraded, they're unstoppable in DoW.
[13:40] <vurtual> You know what'd be cool, if in the future
[13:40] <Azathoth> with exceptions of course. like gaunt's ghosts
[13:40] <vurtual> when we have laser guns and micro-robots
[13:41] <vurtual> wargaming that has little robots that are on a programmable battlefield that reshapes itself
[13:41] <Christoph> Or the tanks.
[13:41] <Christoph> Or those artillery that I forget the name of.
[13:41] <Azathoth> and the little robots actually fire live ammunition?

[13:41] <Christoph> Basilisk tanks.
[13:41] <vurtual> that fire laser pointers and little weak energy weapons, so weak they are only felt by humans and metal things
[13:41] <vurtual> for a second I thought hydralisk. And I don't even play starcraft
[13:42] <Azathoth> fuckin tyranids man
[13:42] <vurtual> The funny thing here is that starcraft was basically an attempt to make an RTS for this, then it had its own thing
[13:42] <Christoph> Then you have little robots running around schools during class, smashing each other in the face and duking it out in the halls.
[13:42] <gdude2002> someone help me test?
[13:42] <Christoph> Oh god.

[13:42] <Christoph> The tyranids.
[13:42] <Azathoth> i think it would be cooler if we could just breed miniature people
[13:42] <Azathoth> to fight little miniature wars
[13:42] <vurtual> then someone uses the technology to make bigger versions of the harmless guns
[13:42] <Shori> I think I could go for Norse beliefs
[13:42] <Shori> :D
[13:42] <vurtual> with a bit more foce
[13:42] <vurtual> force*
[13:42] <Christoph> I think that's playing god in a very literal way.
[13:42] <Konogan> Gdude, works not. Stuck on connecting.
[13:42] <vurtual> So the future nerf guns fire energy projectiles that have the force of nearly a nerf dart.
[13:43] <gdude2002> gotcha
[13:43] <gdude2002> thanks
[13:43] <Azathoth> christoph, yes
[13:43] <Azathoth> i've always wished i could do that
[13:43] <vurtual> while feeling and working like real energy weapnos.
[13:43] <Azathoth> i always wanted to have a tiny little civilization inside an aquarium or something
[13:43] <Azathoth> it would be godlike
[13:43] <bildramer> I MUST USE ALL THIS DESIRE TO PROGRAM BEFORE IT OVERFLOWS
[13:43] <Konogan> ^^^
[13:43] <Konogan> Azathoth I mean.
[13:43] <Azathoth> i'd be like "worship me, faggots"
[13:43] <bildramer> really, out of ideas
[13:43] <bildramer> 2D Minecraft anyone?
[13:43] <Azathoth> and then i would just throw random stuff in there to see what they do
[13:44] <bildramer> or maybe a more Worms-like game?
[13:44] <Konogan> Azathoth, isn't there some games like that?
[13:44] <Shadaez> bildramer someone's already doing that
[13:44] <Azathoth> i mean in real life!
[13:44] <bildramer> lots are
[13:44] <Konogan> I know that but,
[13:44] <Azathoth> i want actual little intelligent people
[13:44] <Azathoth> that are actually aware of their own existence
[13:44] <bildramer> lol
[13:44] <Konogan> It doesn't exist, yet.
[13:45] * Azathoth starts to research genetic engineering >_>
[13:45] <Konogan> >_>
[13:45] <bildramer> you don't have enough Knoweldge
[13:45] <Azathoth> i'm going to make tiny people
[13:45] <bildramer> you have 800, you need 900
[13:45] <Azathoth> and they will worship me
[13:45] <bildramer> build more Universities
[13:45] <Azathoth> i will make them in my image

[13:45] <bildramer> why not simple blobs

[13:46] <Azathoth> they don't need to evolve
[13:46] <bildramer> uh, more brains?
[13:46] <Azathoth> humans have hardly evolved at all in the time that civilization has sprung up
[13:46] <bildramer> before there was only fire
[13:46] <gdude2002> got it
[13:46] <gdude2002> thanks
[13:46] <Azathoth> that doesn't mean humans have physically evolved any
[13:46] <Konogan> really?
[13:46] <Azathoth> they have simply gained knowledge
[13:46] <Konogan> I think I'm crashed XD
[13:47] <gdude2002> yep
[13:47] <gdude2002> you are
[13:47] <gdude2002> lol
[13:47] <vurtual> we thought harder
[13:47] <vurtual> we've becomes tronger
[13:47] <Azathoth> no, all knowledge builds upon previous knowledge
[13:47] <bildramer> first homo * evolved
[13:47] <vurtual> we got generally more tough and well-off, well-mixed and not inbred
[13:47] <bildramer> then we got civilisation
[13:47] <Azathoth> there was only fire in the beginning because there was no knowledge to build upon
[13:47] <bildramer> you'll have to wait some millenia
[13:47] <bildramer> nn*
[13:47] <vurtual> People now really try to use language much harder, think much faster(neerds)
[13:47] <Konogan> XD
[13:47] <Azathoth> not if i genetically engineer current people into miniature people
[13:47] <Shadaez> I think we're going to get dumber - like that one movie.

[13:48] <Azathoth> well i still want my miniature fuckin people
[13:49] <Azathoth> they would basically be children
[13:49] <Azathoth> i'd teach the first ones english and stuff
[13:49] <vurtual> from tlc, little people
[13:49] <Konogan> yup.
[13:49] <Azathoth> and basic math and science
[13:49] <vurtual> In one generation we can suddenly have massive intelligence occour out of thin air

[13:49] <vurtual> (neeerds)
[13:49] <Christoph> Damn it.
[13:49] <Azathoth> they wouldn't be building computers or anything, but they would at least be able to communicate and build simple structures

[13:55] * Marafk-14 is now known as Marach-14
[13:55] <Azathoth> after i gave them fire
[13:55] <bildramer> soi
[13:56] <bildramer> ?
[13:56] * Christoph (Mibbit@adsl-219-59-232.asm.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: I still think there should be a prize.)
[13:56] <Azathoth> i would put a firecracker in there
[13:56] <bildramer> lololol
[13:56] <vurtual> Azathoth, you know really tiny RC helis?
[13:56] <vurtual> Get some miniatures skill on one of those, make a working tiny helicopter.
[13:56] <Azathoth> they would be like "hmm...."
[13:56] <vurtual> A reliable, Russian one.
[13:56] <Azathoth> lol
[13:56] <bildramer> more like "booooommm..."
[13:56] <Azathoth> "this looks flamable... BRING FIRE!"
[13:57] <vurtual> then teach them replacable parts and gunpowder and other technologies I named via civ iv
[13:57] <bildramer> when they start questioning your existence, do stuff
[13:57] <bildramer> atheists would have "bad luck"
[13:57] <vurtual> no no it'd be funnier to watch them get their own ideas
[13:57] * Vis{AFK} (visiiri@96.18.163.231) has joined #minecraft
[13:57] <bildramer> and "random" "accidents"
[13:57] <vurtual> "see, we eevooolved"
[13:57] <Azathoth> i don't think they would question my existence
[13:57] <bildramer> lol
[13:57] <Konogan> XD
[13:57] <Azathoth> they would see me through the glass
[13:57] * superorange (superorang@CPE-121-223-64-245.lnse2.woo.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[13:57] <Azathoth> and my hand when i'm giving them things
[13:57] <vurtual> Azathoth, what if they just think of you as the snu?
[13:57] <vurtual> sun*
[13:57] <Azathoth> but mostly i'd probably let them do their own thing
[13:58] <bildramer> idea
[13:58] <bildramer> while giving things
[13:58] <Azathoth> it would be interesting to see what interesting ideas they come up with
[13:58] <vurtual> knockout gas
[13:58] <bildramer> hold some spaghetti and 2 meatballs
[13:58] <bildramer> :>
[13:58] <Azathoth> i'd probably also try to establish a sustainable population of mice or something
[13:58] <Konogan> "Man, I'm sure this god thing is bullshit..." *get squished by a giant finger* "DUUUUDE!"
[13:58] <bildramer> lol
[13:58] <Azathoth> and if that failed, i'd give them some kind of seed they could use
[13:58] <bildramer> flora and fauna
[13:58] <bildramer> put some in there
[13:58] <bildramer> and sharks
[13:58] <Azathoth> but it would be fun seeing them hunt mice
[13:58] <bildramer> with lasers
[13:59] * Snowman (Snowman@sd51100a0.adsl.wanadoo.nl) has joined #minecraft
[13:59] <vurtual> no, flies, Azathoth
[13:59] <vurtual> with spears
[13:59] <Snowman> Hello
[13:59] <Azathoth> they would probably have to herd them into the corner of the world in order to catch them
[13:59] <bildramer> lol
[13:59] <Azathoth> it would have to be a pretty large aquarium
[13:59] <bildramer> some kilometers
[13:59] <Azathoth> like at least 9 sq meters
[13:59] <bildramer> will do
[13:59] <Azathoth> kilometers would be too big
[13:59] <Azathoth> don't want to have to walk on their world
[13:59] <bildramer> lol
[13:59] <Konogan> Seriously, it sounds awfully fun... but wrong at the same time... But fun anyway! :D
[13:59] * Icereed (icereed@mnch-5d868b98.pool.mediaWays.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:59] <bildramer> 20x20 meters is very enough
[13:59] <Azathoth> it sounds fun as hell
[13:59] <bildramer> yeah
[14:00] <bildramer> playing god is always fun
[14:00] <bildramer> *smite* *smite* *smite*
[14:00] <Konogan> XD
[14:00] <Azathoth> i could fuck with them with a laser
[14:00] <Azathoth> WHAT IS THAT LIGHT
[14:00] <Azathoth> and blind them
[14:00] <vurtual> it's like cats
[14:00] <vurtual> ahahaha microcats
[14:00] <bildramer> lololol
[14:00] <vurtual> give them microcats
[14:00] <vurtual> that are as big as them
[14:00] <bildramer> yeah
[14:00] <bildramer> lol tigers
[14:00] <vurtual> so they ride them like tiny cat-shaped horses
[14:01] <Konogan> Choose a random dude: "You will be my champion! prove me your faith by killing everyone in this village!"
[14:01] <Azathoth> i'd probably dump random buckets of water on them from time to time
[14:01] <Azathoth> to see how they recover
[14:01] <Azathoth> and command them to build churches
[14:01] <bildramer> I wonder what would happen with a malevolent god
[14:01] <bildramer> sacrifices?
[14:01] <Konogan> XD
[14:01] <vurtual> they bite
[14:01] <Azathoth> they would probably try to fight me
[14:01] <Azathoth> they would throw spears at my hand
[14:01] <bildramer> lol
[14:01] <vurtual> get a glove
[14:01] <Azathoth> i'd have to start wearing leather gloves
[14:02] <vurtual> build a huge pile of stuff
[14:02] <Konogan> Azathoth, burn 3/4 of them leave a few survivor.
[14:02] <bildramer> and you would use firecrackers or something
[14:02] <vurtual> claim anyone who reaches the top will recieve enlightenment
[14:02] <bildramer> lol
[14:02] <bildramer> add a big volcano
[14:02] <bildramer> no soda
[14:02] <vurtual> Then, once they do
[14:02] <vurtual> pick them up secretly
[14:02] <vurtual> then, hit it with a crossbow
[14:02] <bildramer> or, hm...
[14:02] <bildramer> make stones out of mentos
[14:02] <Azathoth> or they would learn to burrow underground to avoid me
[14:02] <vurtual> then, place him back, after enlightening him of some strange descriptions of technology
[14:02] <Azathoth> and then it would just be boring :(
[14:02] <bildramer> and when they attack, pour coke
[14:02] <vurtual> see what happens
[14:02] <Azathoth> omg yes
[14:02] <bildramer> if they go underground you're fucked
[14:02] <Azathoth> i could pick one up and show it the real world
[14:02] <Azathoth> like computers
[14:02] <vurtual> flood the holes
[14:03] <bildramer> they'll develop better weapons
[14:03] <Azathoth> it would be like "wth?"
[14:03] <bildramer> and fuck the whole workd
[14:03] <bildramer> ld
[14:03] <bildramer> then only small people will be
[14:03] * smoke (chatzilla@233-ta2-4.acn.waw.pl) has joined #minecraft
[14:03] <Azathoth> dude
[14:03] <bildramer> they'll learn to use technology for bigger people
[14:03] <Azathoth> i could release a few of them into the real world
[14:03] <Azathoth> and see what happens
[14:03] <vurtual> who will learn of the internet due to usability
[14:03] <bildramer> like coffee machines for weekly supplies
[14:03] <vurtual> and then become perverted
[14:03] <vurtual> then try climbing up and on things
[14:04] <bildramer> or using guns instead of cannons
[14:04] <vurtual> THERE'S A MIDGET UP YOUR NIPPLE D:
[14:04] <bildramer> make pirates
[14:04] <smoke> where can i explain myself to admin of server?
[14:04] <Konogan> Azathoth, they could really turn agaisnt you then...
[14:04] <vurtual> smoke
[14:04] <Azathoth> what server?
[14:04] <bildramer> which server?
[14:04] <vurtual> to admin of server
[14:04] <Azathoth> konogan, good point. they could slit my throat in my sleep
[14:04] <smoke> Bashurverse (Mature Community)
[14:04] <vurtual> or bound you
[14:04] <vurtual> Build them a habitat, Azathoth, with water
[14:04] <vurtual> so they have to use ships
[14:04] <gdude2002> lol, mature community
[14:04] <gdude2002> Adultland
[14:05] <Konogan> XD
[14:05] <gdude2002> xD
[14:05] <Azathoth> i'd probalby have to electrify the edge of their aquarium or something
[14:05] <vurtual> if by mature you mean probably like second life
[14:05] <Azathoth> so they can't climb out
[14:05] <Azathoth> and hope they don't develop flight
[14:05] <gdude2002> Either that or block porn
[14:05] <vurtual> they'll dev-
[14:05] <vurtual> PORTALS
[14:05] <Marach-14> oh greeeat. the channel TREE LIST is taking more than half of monitor height
[14:05] * cryzed (cryzed@i59F5D9F3.versanet.de) has joined #minecraft
[14:05] <smoke> so i build a tower. some dude make a aircraft close to tower i was banned from making scene from 9/11, but it wasn`t me
[14:05] <gdude2002> lol marach
[14:05] <Azathoth> rofl smoke
[14:05] <bildramer> eventually their tech will be too advanced
[14:05] <Marach-14> i had to change when it didn't fit in tab view
[14:05] <bildramer> haha smoke
[14:05] <Azathoth> bildramer, it would take thousands of years
[14:05] <smoke> so guys?
[14:05] <bildramer> uh, perhaps you could ask in the forums
[14:05] <gdude2002> smoke: Just ask on their server
[14:05] <gdude2002> not here
[14:05] <Azathoth> and they probably wouldn't have the materials to make anything too advanced
[14:05] <smoke> im banned :<
[14:05] <Marach-14> i had a hard time getting used to tree view
[14:06] <bildramer> make a throwaway account
[14:06] <bildramer> or change IP somehow
[14:06] <Marach-14> 7 networks :/
[14:06] <smoke> ew
[14:06] <smoke> is there irc of server or something?
[14:06] <bildramer> Azathoth: give them
[14:06] <bildramer> liquid helium
[14:06] <bildramer> smoke, I don't think so
[14:06] <Azathoth> no, but that gives me a good idea
[14:06] <Azathoth> i could make ponds of liquid nitrogen
[14:06] <vurtual> balloons
[14:06] <smoke> well screw it
[14:06] <smoke> thx anyway
[14:06] <vurtual> tiny balloons
[14:06] <Azathoth> the people would think they're magical
[14:07] <vurtual> being kept cool by systems below
[14:07] <Azathoth> and they would disappear into the mist to never be seen again
[14:07] <vurtual> that would make a lot of heat
[14:07] <vurtual> until it evaporates
[14:07] <Azathoth> yeah
[14:07] <vurtual> Then you find everybody frozen in place
[14:07] <Azathoth> and then there are frozen dead bodies
[14:07] <Azathoth> it would be epic
[14:07] <vurtual> dead, or dying there
[14:07] <vurtual> that'd be depressing :(

[14:08] <vurtual> How did fred drop it into water in that one scooby doo episode!?
[14:08] <vurtual> HAS MY WHOLE LIFE BEEN A LIE?
[14:08] <Shadaez> it's not really a burn
[14:08] <Konogan> Seriously, someone need to make something that replicate that experiance... A god simulator? XD
[14:08] <vurtual> black & white?
[14:08] <Shadaez> and yeah, Black and White
[14:08] <Azathoth> black & white is as close as it gets
[14:09] <Azathoth> but they're not intelligent enough
[14:09] <Konogan> Well, I mean...
[14:09] <Konogan> Mmmh...

[14:09] <bildramer> in DF you're pretty much a deity
[14:09] <Konogan> It would be B&W but with ages?
[14:09] <bildramer> commanding some dorfs
[14:09] <vurtual> who cannot control people directly with magical hands
[14:09] <bildramer> so if they could get smart enough... hm...
[14:09] <vurtual> so he has to either order them
[14:09] <vurtual> or get personal
[14:09] <vurtual> with a sword
[14:09] <Azathoth> it would also be fun to fire a gun into the miniature world
[14:10] <Azathoth> it would be like meteorites
[14:10] <Konogan> Yeah XFD
[14:10] <Konogan> XD*
[14:10] <bildramer> "You told me to pull that lever that would kill me! Now watch as I betray you and go with the goblin invaders!"
[14:10] <Azathoth> they would collect the bullets
[14:10] <Azathoth> and be like whoa
[14:10] <bildramer> actually
[14:10] <bildramer> the pressure wave would kill many
[14:10] <Konogan> Also, B&W doesn't have a free mode or multiplayer.does it
[14:10] <bildramer> also, your voice
[14:10] <Konogan> ?
[14:10] <bildramer> keep it low
[14:10] <Azathoth> and i could throw in old bottle caps and random litlte manufactured items
[14:10] <Azathoth> they would think they're ancient relics
[14:10] <bildramer> lol
[14:10] <Azathoth> i'd bury them of course
[14:10] <bildramer> a calculator
[14:11] * cryzed (cryzed@i59F5D9F3.versanet.de) has joined #minecraft
[14:11] <bildramer> watch as they press random buttons in rituals
[14:11] <Azathoth> and i'd get some souveneir model of a pyramid from mexico or something
[14:11] <Azathoth> and put it in there
[14:11] <Azathoth> i wonder if they would figure out patterns on the calculator
[14:11] <Azathoth> and learn to write 8008 on it or something
[14:12] <vurtual> 58008
[14:12] <bildramer> :l
[14:12] <vurtual> then they demand whatever the funny pattern has
[14:12] <bildramer> put a CD in there
[14:12] <vurtual> and a CD drive in a cliff face
[14:13] <vurtual> that opens when you enter a combo on a buried panel
[14:13] <bildramer> or a small notebook or iPod or something
[14:13] <bildramer> coins perhaps
[14:13] <bildramer> they'll use them for wheels maybe
[14:13] <Azathoth> omg
[14:13] <Azathoth> let's go back to the basics though
[14:13] <Azathoth> how would i keep them alive?
[14:13] <bildramer> gears
[14:13] <vurtual> doom
[14:13] <vurtual> put doom in there
[14:13] * superorange (superorang@CPE-121-223-64-245.lnse2.woo.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[14:13] <bildramer> lol
[14:13] <bildramer> food
[14:13] <Azathoth> as in: how would they have fire and food?
[14:13] <Azathoth> and water?
[14:13] <bildramer> pizza aka mana
[14:13] <vurtual> drop it in
[14:13] <Konogan> Seriously, the level of awesomeness of that idea is really great.
[14:13] <bildramer> give them seeds
[14:13] <Azathoth> water would be easy. i'd just make sure they had a fresh supply of water
[14:13] <vurtual> porkchop sandwiches
[14:13] <Azathoth> an aquarium filter or something
[14:14] <vurtual> they are on fire, so there's fire too
[14:14] <Azathoth> but food...
[14:14] <bildramer> porkchop sandwiches
[14:14] <bildramer> yeeeah
[14:14] <Azathoth> i'd have to actually give them food at first
[14:14] <Azathoth> but maybe i could teach them to cultivate plants
[14:14] <bildramer> give mana
[14:14] <bildramer> honey or pizza or something
[14:14] <bildramer> sugar
[14:14] <bildramer> :>
[14:14] <Azathoth> and like i said, i'd probably try to get a sustainable animal population of some kind
[14:14] <Konogan> Mmmh... the only way I think I'll be able to do that is by...
[14:14] <bildramer> eggs
[14:14] <Konogan> Oh yeah.
[14:14] <Azathoth> either guppies or mice or something
[14:14] <bildramer> give them metal
[14:15] <bildramer> some soft metal
[14:15] <bildramer> gold
[14:15] <Azathoth> guppies would probably be the best bet, because they're hardy and they reproduce like motherfuckers
[14:15] <bildramer> what will their soil be?
[14:15] <bildramer> make sure there are no worms
[14:15] <bildramer> lol
[14:15] <Azathoth> oh god
[14:15] <Azathoth> worms would be creepy
[14:15] <Azathoth> yes worms
[14:15] <bildramer> spiders >:D
[14:15] <Codlike> Wow, my Indev tutorial pic I made a couple months ago has had about 608 views on Deviant Art.
[14:15] <vurtual> jumping spiders
[14:15] <vurtual> which they tame
[14:15] <vurtual> and ride
[14:15] <bildramer> they'll be all "omg headcrabs"
[14:15] <bildramer> hm
[14:16] <bildramer> add a saltwater lake
[14:16] <Azathoth> i don't think i'd introduce anything dangerous until a stable population has been established
[14:16] <vurtual> then drop larger animals in sometimes
[14:16] <bildramer> and mini-fish
[14:16] <vurtual> like a puppy
[14:16] <bildramer> and mini-whales
[14:16] <vurtual> what would happen with a pupppy?
[14:16] <Azathoth> o god
[14:16] <bildramer> lololol
[14:16] <Azathoth> it would eat them
[14:16] <bildramer> omg the blood
[14:16] <vurtual> yeah
[14:16] <vurtual> and shake them around playfully
[14:16] <bildramer> that's getting more into nazi science :\
[14:16] <Azathoth> a cat would be scarier though
[14:16] <vurtual> with its sharp teeth
[14:16] <vurtual> "O GREAT DESTROYER, WE MEAN YOU NO HARM."
[14:16] <Azathoth> it would stalk them
[14:16] <Azathoth> and then pounce out of nowhere
[14:16] <Azathoth> and then play with them before it eats them
[14:16] <Azathoth> clawing at them
[14:17] <bildramer> butterflie
[14:17] <bildramer> s
[14:17] <Azathoth> if they disobeyed me i'd put my cat in there
[14:17] <Azathoth> and what about fire?
[14:17] <bildramer> your cat won't live for long
[14:17] <vurtual> *puppy is shaking dwarf around, dwarf going aaaaaaaaaa in a dopplery back-and-forth manner*
[14:17] <vurtual> "Okay he's not listening, get out that railgun."
[14:17] <Azathoth> how would they create fire?
[14:17] <vurtual> "ARP!"
[14:17] <Azathoth> i'd probably have to give them a source of fire
[14:17] <Azathoth> like matches
[14:17] <vurtual> they'd use sticks
[14:17] <bildramer> matches
[14:18] <Azathoth> it would be a group effort to light a fire
[14:18] <Konogan> Azathoth, we need to buy an island and some apes... That could work >:D
[14:18] <bildramer> you almost ninja'd me
[14:18] <bildramer> ...
[14:18] <bildramer> why not flint
[14:18] <Konogan> I mean, sure they're bigger but.
[14:18] <bildramer> put some in a blender
[14:18] <bildramer> it will blend
[14:18] <vurtual> will it?
[14:18] <Azathoth> apes are scary
[14:18] <Konogan> Still.
[14:18] <vurtual> will it blend: midget colony
[14:18] <bildramer> lololol
[14:18] <Azathoth> o god
[14:18] <Konogan> XD
[14:18] <bildramer> put a book in there
[14:18] <Azathoth> i could put them in a blender as a display of force
[14:18] <vurtual> waaaAAaaAAAaaAAAAthnk
[14:18] <bildramer> watch as they try to decrypt ancient organic ruins
[14:19] <vurtual> put porn in there
[14:19] <bildramer> lol
[14:19] <vurtual> mini-porn
[14:19] <bildramer> gunpowder
[14:19] <Azathoth> they would worship it
[14:19] <Azathoth> also, not books
[14:19] <bildramer> :l
[14:19] <Azathoth> those microslide things
[14:19] <Azathoth> or just something with really tiny writing
[14:19] <bildramer> LEDs
[14:19] <bildramer> a battery
[14:19] <bildramer> anything
[14:19] <vurtual> YE BEINGS WHO CAUSE US TO HAVE GOOD AIM ON THE TOILET
[14:19] <Roadcrosser> back
[14:19] <vurtual> because they have no females
[14:19] <Azathoth> but the writing should be completely pointless.like "i like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches" or something
[14:19] <bildramer> :l
[14:19] <Azathoth> they would worship it
[14:20] <vurtual> "We must appease him by making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches"
[14:20] <vurtual> Then they do, really well
[14:20] <bildramer> write "this world is going to end in 5 days"
[14:20] <bildramer> then flood them somehow
[14:20] <bildramer> give the survivors a fake feeling of being special
[14:20] <Azathoth> i don't want to flood the whole world
[14:20] <vurtual> then they end up recieving more things, as they produce the world's greatest sandwiches
[14:20] <Azathoth> but i could give them boats
[14:20] <bildramer> add milk pools
[14:20] <Azathoth> dood yea
[14:20] <Azathoth> i should split the world in half by water
[14:20] <bildramer> mana from the sky etc. etc.
[14:20] <bildramer> what about light?
[14:20] <Azathoth> and when i feel they're advanced enough, i should give them a boat
[14:20] <vurtual> an LED
[14:20] <Azathoth> and see what happens
[14:20] <bildramer> destroy your roof
[14:21] <bildramer> lol
[14:21] <bildramer> cue sunburns
[14:21] <vurtual> have two seperate colonies
[14:21] <Azathoth> the other side would have more resources too
[14:21] <Azathoth> or yea
[14:21] <vurtual> Who are disconnected.
[14:21] * smoke (chatzilla@233-ta2-4.acn.waw.pl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[14:21] <Azathoth> i could start two separate colonies
[14:21] <vurtual> the only way to reach the other one, a pipe
[14:21] <bildramer> also, be aware that they would be able to easily lift heavy objects
[14:21] <Azathoth> that are disconnected until they invent or are given boats
[14:21] <vurtual> which is too unsafe to swim
[14:21] <vurtual> and eventually goes down, flooding.
[14:21] <bildramer> or just a monster
[14:21] <bildramer> jellyfish
[14:21] <Azathoth> piranhas?
[14:21] <Konogan> Azathoth, how many people do you think you need in each colony?
[14:21] <Azathoth> idk
[14:21] <Azathoth> several hundred
[14:21] <bildramer> war
[14:21] <Konogan> :/
[14:21] <Azathoth> but to start it off, maybe 10 or so?
[14:22] <vurtual> I'd say a small populace like 20 works
[14:22] <vurtual> give them one of those tiny handheld TVs.
[14:22] <bildramer> lol
[14:22] <vurtual> which is linked to a computer
[14:22] <Azathoth> i need to have enough genetic diversity that they don't devolve
[14:22] <vurtual> so they learn to use the internet
[14:22] <Chris220> Will notch add lockable chests for when multiplayer comes out? Otherwise people are gonna go around stealing stuff :V
[14:22] <bildramer> maybe
[14:22] <Azathoth> this chest is locked? *break*
[14:22] <bildramer> haha
[14:22] <Chris220> Well maybe chests that can only be used by their owner :P
[14:22] <Chris220> But yeah
[14:22] <Chris220> I see your point there
[14:22] <bildramer> destroy everything around the chest
[14:22] <bildramer> profit
[14:23] <bildramer> look at the owner not being able to reach it
[14:23] <Chris220> xD
[14:23] <bildramer> or perhaps flood it with lava
[14:23] <Chris220> Funny stuff :V
[14:23] <Azathoth> owner can just build to it?
[14:23] <Konogan> Bill, you gorgot the ????
[14:23] <Konogan> forgot*
[14:23] <bildramer> :l
[14:23] <Azathoth> seriously... what kind of metal?
[14:23] <Chris220> Meh, I guess we'll just have to keep close tabs on potential griefers
[14:23] <Azathoth> oh!
[14:23] <Azathoth> pewter!
[14:23] * Roadcrosser is singing Still Alive and sounding like GLaDOS with his ultra-high-annoying voice
[14:23] <Konogan> What?
[14:23] <Azathoth> pewter is a fairly soft metal
[14:23] <Azathoth> and not expensive as gold
[14:23] * UltimateBudgie loves roadcrosse
[14:23] <Konogan> I hope.
[14:23] <Azathoth> they may be able to make use of it
[14:24] <Azathoth> to make tools
[14:24] <Roadcrosser> ohi budgie
[14:24] <Konogan> Mmmh...
[14:24] <Konogan> I want to make swords...
[14:24] <Azathoth> and has a low melting point
[14:24] <Konogan> BRB getting metal!
[14:24] <Azathoth> in fact
[14:24] <Azathoth> they could probably even melt it on fire
[14:24] <Azathoth> over fire*
[14:25] <Snowman> Guys
[14:25] <Azathoth> guy
[14:25] <Snowman> When is chesse20 finally getting banned?
[14:25] <Azathoth> *shrug*
[14:25] <Snowman> He's the biggest moron I've ever seen
[14:26] <bildramer> what'd he do
[14:26] <Konogan> Azathoth, you could give them... ALUMINUM!
[14:26] <bildramer> except being a moron?
[14:26] <Azathoth> i was just thinking that
[14:26] <Morkraw> in one of the interviews notch said he was going to leave it and see what happened, and if it was needed add stuff like chest access control and he has mentioned land ownership flags which would lock down a radius of the map from being messed with by people who werent wanted
[14:26] <Snowman> Spam
[14:26] <bildramer> Azathoth, potassium
[14:26] <Azathoth> but i don't know how maleable aluminum is
[14:26] <bildramer> they will add water eventually
[14:26] <Konogan> It is.
[14:26] <Chris220> Morkraw: Sounds like a good plan
[14:26] <Konogan> Just take aluminum paper XD
[14:26] <Azathoth> i know it's light weight, which would be good
[14:26] <Azathoth> ah yea
[14:26] <Azathoth> good idea. that would be a plentiful source
[14:26] <Konogan> Yup.
[14:27] <Azathoth> and they could probably crush it together or something to shape it
[14:27] <Chris220> Hopefully a "friends list" of sorts as well, that could be quite useful :P
[14:27] <Azathoth> and eventually develop more advanced metalcrafting techniques
[14:27] <Morkraw> yeah
[14:27] <vurtual> no no
[14:27] <bildramer> make a miniature "ancient" temple
[14:27] <vurtual> minecraft requires freedom of editing duh
[14:27] <Azathoth> like they'd learn to put it over a fire somehow and then take it out and hammer it
[14:27] <bildramer> hammer?
[14:27] <bildramer> :P
[14:27] <Azathoth> they could build a hammer out of a rock and a stick
[14:27] <Konogan> We still need the mini people though, Azathoth...
[14:27] <Azathoth> and some rope-like material
[14:27] * RaidSoft (raid@hd5e272a0.gavlegardarna.gavle.to) has joined #minecraft
[14:27] <Azathoth> i could give them string
[14:27] <Azathoth> konogan, let's study genetics all hardcore like
[14:28] <Azathoth> and make them >_>
[14:28] <Morkraw> to destroy is easier and faster than to create, hence without control minecraft would die imo
[14:28] <Konogan> Azathoth, give them spiders XD

[14:28] <Azathoth> actually it's kinda easier to build in minecraft
[14:28] <Azathoth> block placement is instantaneous
[14:29] * Smashing (Smashing@adsl-178-217-216.jax.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[14:29] <Azathoth> oh, well i guess you have to destroy to get the material in the first place
[14:29] <Chris220> Yeah, but you don't have infinite blocks
[14:29] <Chris220> ;)
[14:29] <Chris220> Yeah XD
[14:29] <Morkraw> depending on what gets implemented
[14:29] <bildramer> noooo
[14:29] <bildramer> discussion, don't die out
[14:29] <vurtual> Hey guys you know what'll be cool
[14:29] <Azathoth> as for the metal distribution in my mini world (different subject, not minecraft), i'd probably just lay down random sheets of aluminum above the rock layer when creating my world :D
[14:29] <vurtual> All this primitive people stuff got me thinking
[14:29] <bildramer> give them sand
[14:29] <bildramer> and lots
[14:30] <bildramer> they will use the silicon somehow
[14:30] <vurtual> Remember wehn DARPA was talking about their energy shields that could be shot from safely?
[14:30] <bildramer> glass, lol
[14:30] <Azathoth> i'd give them a mixture of sand and dirt
[14:30] <bildramer> add some uranium in a corner
[14:30] <bildramer> very littls
[14:30] <bildramer> le
[14:30] <Azathoth> god no :P
[14:30] <vurtual> Iamgine if we just went to North Korea, with a SEAL team once we had those, calmly walked in, and demanded every prisoner set free.
[14:30] <bildramer> they will try to get it and die from radiation
[14:30] <vurtual> and nobody can shoot them
[14:30] * Smashing (Smashing@adsl-178-217-216.jax.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

[14:31] <vurtual> in one generation
[14:31] <Konogan> :O
[14:31] <Azathoth> i think for fire, i should just give them a permanent flame source
[14:31] <Morkraw> if notch were to make your inventory persist between servers or something (not so hard to imagine, it would be a decent feature to have if rarer materials for armor come into play or something) then enterprising griefers will clone their personal maps to clone TNT and then invade and blow your shizzle up

[14:31] * Dog (MarkTraceu@cpe-76-174-119-97.socal.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[14:31] <Azathoth> they could build their village around it for safety at night from the giant mice
[14:31] <bildramer> they will extinguish it
[14:32] <vurtual> far left |----POINT--o-| far right
[14:32] <vurtual> the o is you
[14:32] <vurtual> zooming away
[14:32] <vurtual> resulting in some kind of mass that expands a female minidwarf out
[14:32] <vurtual> then it goes and escapes into society
[14:32] <Azathoth> how the hell would they extinguish it?
[14:32] <vurtual> Then their kids randomly genetically relapse into 6cm size
[14:32] <bildramer> water?
[14:32] <vurtual> scaring doctors
[14:32] <bildramer> lolol
[14:32] <Azathoth> how?
[14:32] <vurtual> or they just produce a new colony
[14:32] <Azathoth> it would be connected to a propane source
[14:32] <Azathoth> and be constantly burning
[14:32] <vurtual> instead of one kid, a bunch of people just slide out
[14:32] <bildramer> still
[14:33] <Azathoth> like the fire on JFK's grave or whatever
[14:33] <Azathoth> you can't extinguish it
[14:33] <bildramer> they could build something around it
[14:33] <bildramer> so no oxygen
[14:33] <Azathoth> why would they?
[14:33] <bildramer> dunno
[14:33] <Azathoth> it would be their only source of fire
[14:33] <Azathoth> and if they disobeyed me, i'd cut them off
[14:33] <bildramer> to protect it maybe?
[14:33] <Konogan> Or kill some :D
[14:33] <bildramer> yeah
[14:33] <Azathoth> then they would have to make sacrifices at the great flame for me to turn it back on
[14:33] <bildramer> they will surely use plants to keep some fire
[14:34] <Azathoth> or
[14:34] <Azathoth> in the beginning i could drop a burning log or something in
[14:34] <Azathoth> and tell them to never lose that fire
[14:34] <Snowman> http://images.encyclopediadramatica.com/images/2/2b/Desmond_as_Horatio.jpg
[14:34] <Konogan> They would probably just burn some things and then make fires with it.
[14:34] <Snowman> Win picture
[14:34] <Azathoth> lol
[14:34] <Morkraw> but the TNT griefers! wont somebody think of the TNT griefers!
[14:34] <bildramer> lol
[14:34] <Konogan> Rofl, anti-locke XD
[14:35] <bildramer> yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaah
[14:35] <Azathoth> i should put cockroaches in their world
[14:35] <Azathoth> that would be creepy as fuck
[14:35] <bildramer> let's take this discussion to another channel
[14:35] <Azathoth> they'd have to fight the cockroaches to defend their food
[14:35] <bildramer> indeed
[14:35] <bildramer> hm
[14:35] <bildramer> put some crystals in
[14:35] <bildramer> or colored stone
[14:35] <bildramer> or plastic

[14:36] <bildramer> or art
[14:36] <Azathoth> colored plastic
[14:36] <bildramer> lol
[14:36] <Azathoth> i could just bury a bunch of really random stuff underground
[14:36] <Azathoth> lots of shiny stuff

[14:38] <bildramer> a whole bucket?
[14:38] <Azathoth> maybe not a whole bucket, but enough to be confusing
[14:38] <vurtual> hey guys you know those world's fair 1939 highway designs where there was a second level for foot traffic
[14:38] <Azathoth> and to cover a variety of things
[14:38] <vurtual> Does anyone else really want those?
[14:38] <Azathoth> no
[14:38] <bildramer> so.
[14:39] <Azathoth> you know what else it would be fun to give them?
[14:39] <bildramer> hm
[14:39] <Azathoth> fuckin lego blocks
[14:39] <bildramer> pandemics!
[14:39] <bildramer> lol
[14:39] <bildramer> aids
[14:39] <Azathoth> they would be buried like a rare mineral resource

[14:39] <Azathoth> with thatch roofs
[14:39] <vurtual> You have researched lego assembling

[14:42] <vurtual> It's like a tiny ambassador.
[14:42] <bildramer> add coins*
[14:43] <vurtual> lego wheels
[14:43] <vurtual> imagine having a pinfire bb gun
[14:43] <Azathoth> they would have to be japanese or whatever the ones are that have the square hole in hte middle
[14:43] <vurtual> then putting lego wheels on it.
[14:43] <vurtual> and using it as a cannon
[14:43] <bildramer> get a flashlight

[14:45] <vurtual> lcd-laced... sugar crystals
[14:45] <bildramer> maybe
[14:45] <vurtual> to them, they're crystals
[14:46] <Azathoth> i could sprinkle sugar on them
[14:46] <Azathoth> and see what happens
[14:46] <vurtual> Also a 6cm tall guy would have amoebas be fit in his hand
[14:46] <vurtual> so that's maybe a bit too small of a hand
[14:46] <bildramer> you'll have some sugar rush
[14:46] <Konogan> lol
[14:46] <Azathoth> i seriously want to see what interesting temples they would build for me
[14:47] <vurtual> I closed my eyes and there was a train coming at me
[14:47] <vurtual> that was scary
[14:47] <bildramer> :\
[14:47] <Azathoth> i could propose a contest to the two tribes to build the grandest temple
[14:47] <CrazySpai__> Morning.
[14:47] <Azathoth> and the one i like the most gets a piece of bread or something
[14:47] <vurtual> and then there was a Japanese G-Man, but I apparently avoided it
[14:47] <bildramer> a piece of bread?
[14:47] <bildramer> seriously
[14:47] <bildramer> give them some cake
[14:47] <Azathoth> dude
[14:47] <vurtual> and an American one that was also really scary aaaagh the exposure in the room is too high
[14:47] <Azathoth> it would feed them for like a month
[14:48] <bildramer> with bread
[14:48] <bildramer> :|

[14:48] <vurtual> Anyways give them weed.
[14:48] <bildramer> instead give them shinies
[14:48] <vurtual> Give them a self-lighting weed device
[14:48] <vurtual> They enter the temple
[14:48] <Azathoth> or i could give them a bunch of (fake) gold
[14:48] <vurtual> then it seals, and it's dark
[14:48] <bildramer> give the winners 2 wangs
[14:48] <vurtual> then they start getting high
[14:48] <CrazySpai__> Instead give them quickies
[14:48] <bildramer> you can make them smaller, heck
[14:48] <vurtual> and the room lights up and it's a miniature room with wh40k guys in it
[14:48] <vurtual> see how they act
[14:48] <Azathoth> dude
[14:48] <Azathoth> i could use some miniatures as statues
[14:49] <Azathoth> ancient statues
[14:49] <vurtual> ancient marines
[14:49] <vurtual> with unintelligeble names
[14:49] <Azathoth> they would worship them thinking they are ancient gods
[14:49] <bildramer> remember
[14:49] <bildramer> those guys will be fucking strong
[14:49] <Azathoth> i'd invent some crazy religion
[14:49] <vurtual> ancient warrior race
[14:49] <vurtual> NO BETTER IDEA
[14:49] <vurtual> HAVE THEM WARGAME
[14:49] <vurtual> as cosplay
[14:49] <bildramer> they'll easily lift 2-5 of them
[14:49] <bildramer> lol
[14:49] <vurtual> Wargaming to us, the commander, and LARP to them
[14:49] <Azathoth> no, real war to them
[14:49] <vurtual> nerf guns
[14:49] <Azathoth> lol
[14:50] <vurtual> and foam balls
[14:50] <bildramer> whip cream
[14:50] <Azathoth> and from time to time i could bring friends
[14:50] <vurtual> So you'd have some legendary space marine guy, who is incredibly agile in his armor, and a good throw.
[14:50] <Azathoth> and my friends would lean in so they could be seen
[14:50] <vurtual> Where are you going to get tau? :|
[14:50] <vurtual> *foomp foomp foomp*
[14:50] <Konogan> That make me think about something... Maybe there could be gods in minecraft... I mean, player-controlled ones that have the power of life and death and can create and destroy anything. BUT, they must get prayers from the other players to get enough power to do those things. Also, if they don't have enough power they become mortal. :D
[14:50] <Azathoth> and then the little people would be truly afraid knowing that there are multiple gods
[14:51] <vurtual> cool idea Konogan
[14:51] <bildramer> there are over 6 billion gods
[14:51] <vurtual> infact there could be a whole magic system
[14:51] <bildramer> lol
[14:51] <vurtual> however everyone has a pitiful amount of mp
[14:51] <Konogan> Yep.
[14:51] <Azathoth> in fact, there would be more gods than there would be little people
[14:51] <vurtual> so they have to work together to make anything beyond "cool party trick"
[14:51] <vurtual> Each of them would get a city to command them arond
[14:52] <vurtual> Anyways part of me wants to create miniatures now, Azathoth. It's your fault.
[14:52] <bildramer> when the need arises, make a second aquatium
[14:52] <pontusedberg> zzzz
[14:52] <bildramer> r
[14:52] <Azathoth> fuck. i wish there miniature people so bad D:
[14:52] <pontusedberg> zzzzzZZZZZ
[14:52] <pontusedberg> BOOOOOM
[14:52] <bildramer> and split the first
[14:52] <Konogan> Same!!!
[14:52] <bildramer> see what myths they tell later
[14:52] <Azathoth> :D
[14:52] <Azathoth> yes
[14:52] <Azathoth> they'd hand down histories of another world
[14:52] <vurtual> hey here's an idea
[14:52] <vurtual> you know model trains
[14:52] <vurtual> give them a model train
[14:52] <Azathoth> lol
[14:52] <bildramer> :D
[14:52] <Azathoth> they would get electrocuted on the track
[14:52] <Azathoth> it would be hilarious
[14:53] <vurtual> :(
[14:53] <bildramer> rofl
[14:53] <Konogan> Omg, I would so want to see the timeline at the end XD
[14:53] <vurtual> they don't zap you that bad at all
[14:53] <Azathoth> i mean they would figure it out after a few deaths
[14:53] <vurtual> get a battery-powered one
[14:53] <vurtual> with inside controls
[14:53] * outsomnia (wahaha@adsl-69-225-89-100.dsl.skt2ca.pacbell.net) Quit (Quit: Quit DestinyMS! Forever! \o/)
[14:53] <Azathoth> they don't zap US that bad
[14:53] <vurtual> flies can land on them
[14:53] <Azathoth> but to tiny people, it would be killer
[14:53] <bildramer> lol
[14:53] <bildramer> give them electricity, yeah
[14:53] <vurtual> The equivelant of a deadly jolt to them
[14:53] <vurtual> would deal serious damage to your hand
[14:53] <bildramer> they will eventually make chips smaller than ours
[14:53] <vurtual> us not really getting any zap at all?
[14:53] <bildramer> steal some
[14:53] <bildramer> lol
[14:53] <vurtual> They get high
[14:54] * causticLagomorph (chatzilla@client-82-31-8-228.midd.adsl.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[14:54] <Azathoth> well even if it wasn't deadly to them, it would be quite a jolt
[14:54] <Azathoth> probably the equivalent of us sticking our hand in a 120v outlet
[14:54] <vurtual> yeah it'd be like, warm buzzing at most
[14:54] <vurtual> no no more like the equivelant
[14:54] <Azathoth> no. those tracks can shock you pretty good
[14:54] <vurtual> of touching a piece of metal that has some static electricity, if that
[14:54] <vurtual> If you're a WIMP
[14:54] <vurtual> REAL MEN are insulators!
[14:54] <vurtual> pure water
[14:55] <Azathoth> it would be fun to see train wrecks
[14:55] <Azathoth> like if something fell on the track
[14:55] * chac (chatzilla@ip56582c0f.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft
[14:55] <Azathoth> and it derailed
[14:55] <Azathoth> all the little people would be like aaahhhh as the train careens into the lake
[14:55] <bildramer> they won't be able to make nuclear weapons :/
[14:56] <Azathoth> they wouldn't have the resources
[14:56] <Shori> 120VAC outlets?
[14:56] <Shori> I'm game
[14:56] <Azathoth> and they would effectively lose most of our knowledge
[14:56] * Shori BZZZZZZZAP
[14:56] <bildramer> they won't be able to reach critical mass
[14:56] <bildramer> duh
[14:56] <Azathoth> so even if it were physically possible to make, it would take them thousands of years
[14:56] <bildramer> without dying
[14:57] <vurtual> anyways imagine if you made some model city
[14:57] <vurtual> which had a real environment
[14:57] <vurtual> and then you had them detail and live in it
[14:57] <bildramer> so, microcats
[14:57] <vurtual> micro dogs :D
[14:57] <bildramer> no stfu
[14:57] <bildramer> cats
[14:57] <vurtual> Then, when people see it, they have to hum "pure imagination"
[14:57] <vurtual> Because it defies
[14:57] <vurtual> aaany expliinaaaation
[14:57] <vurtual> and that's now stuck in your head
[14:58] <vurtual> Anyways you could make it huge
[14:58] <Azathoth> good thing i don't even know what that song is
[14:58] <vurtual> Like the size of a one story house
[14:58] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3nV6WqA4Y0 Azathoth
[14:58] <bildramer> lol
[14:58] <bildramer> :|
[14:58] <Azathoth> ugh
[14:58] <vurtual> Anyways if you could take a one-story house, and then have a toy train run around it, model stuff and such
[14:58] <Azathoth> i don't want to create things for them
[14:58] <Azathoth> i want to give them resources
[14:58] <Azathoth> and see what they create
[14:58] <Azathoth> (and then i want to destroy some of it)
[14:59] <vurtual> okay
[14:59] <vurtual> give them the resources to build the city
[14:59] <vurtual> and instructions
[14:59] <vurtual> then set them to work
[14:59] <Azathoth> no instructions!
[14:59] <vurtual> via a booming voice
[14:59] <Azathoth> i want to see emergent behavior
[14:59] <Azathoth> i could say "work together and build a city"
[14:59] <Konogan> Weirdly, I want to play Majesty now...
[14:59] <Azathoth> but i won't be specific
[14:59] <vurtual> so they create a model city by hand, with a working train
[14:59] <Azathoth> anyway
[14:59] <Azathoth> i said i was going to bed like 2 hours ago
[14:59] <Azathoth> fuck you guys
[14:59] <bildramer> lol
[15:00] <Azathoth> it's been an exciting conversation though
[15:00] <Siiseli> how funny
[15:00] <Siiseli> I had the same thing yesterday
[15:00] <Konogan> Yeah, this little dudes idea is so epic XD
[15:00] <vurtual> I just got up earlier guys
[15:00] <vurtual> you're supposed to be up four hours ago maggots.
[15:00] <vurtual> then
[15:00] <Siiseli> so guys let's talk about religion, philosophy and politics, RIGHT
[15:00] <vurtual> We'll begin, with a spin, travelling in the world of my creaation
[15:00] <Siiseli> (I'm kidding, please don't)
[15:00] <bildramer> D:
[15:00] <vurtual> what we will see will defy...
[15:00] <bildramer> noes
[15:00] <Konogan> XD
[15:00] <vurtual> explinaaaation
[15:00] <vurtual> we did earlier Siiseli
[15:00] <Siiseli> vurtual, haha
[15:01] <Konogan> Yup.
[15:01] <Siiseli> did you have a good time
[15:01] <vurtual> and voodoo apparently, one guy tried
[15:01] <Konogan> And infact, the idea of playing god with those little midgets rises a lot of philosophical question. :P
[15:01] <Azathoth> this is what black & white should have been
[15:01] <bildramer> use'm lil' people as voodoo dolls
[15:01] <Azathoth> but black & white was ultimately too much of a game
[15:01] <vurtual> with a physics engine and a huge amount of control
[15:02] <vurtual> and fairly smart AI
[15:02] <Azathoth> and this, in a game form, would be totally sandbox
[15:02] <Azathoth> as in, your power is unlimited
[15:02] <vurtual> So it learns to build
[15:02] <Azathoth> and less magical and more environmental
[15:02] * Bodie (bodieh@124-169-236-203.dyn.iinet.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[15:02] <vurtual> maybe guys couldn't be directly manipulated if they got all matrix-y
[15:02] <Konogan> XD
[15:02] <vurtual> and they revolted against your actions
[15:02] <Bodie> howdy friends
[15:02] <vurtual> their very revolt making you unable to influence them or their area
[15:02] <Konogan> Vurtual, you burn them if they do.
[15:02] <Bodie> who had that server i was building in the other night?
[15:02] <Bodie> snowman was there
[15:02] <vurtual> they'll revolt more!
[15:03] <Bodie> thats all i remember
[15:03] <Azathoth> no
[15:03] <Siiseli> witness my limitless power
[15:03] <vurtual> unless you NUKE IT FROM ORBIT
[15:03] <bildramer> ...?
[15:03] <Azathoth> they shouldn't be able to limit your power by lack of prayer
[15:03] <vurtual> As it's the only way to be sure.
[15:03] <Snowman> ?
[15:03] <Snowman> I was where yesteryda?
[15:03] <Azathoth> that's too gamey
[15:03] <vurtual> Just as long as they don't actively try to oppose you
[15:03] <Snowman> Oh that server
[15:03] <Bodie> it was a few days ago
[15:03] <Snowman> wlfeh's server
[15:03] <Azathoth> there need to be no game-like limits
[15:03] <Azathoth> pure sandbox
[15:03] <Bodie> ah k
[15:03] <vurtual> then you can ragdoll them around and even distort them a bit
[15:03] <Siiseli> vurtual, if they do.. NUKE THEM FROM ORBIT
[15:03] <Bodie> thats right
[15:03] <Azathoth> if they want to rebel, they'll throw weapons at your hand
[15:03] <Bodie> thank ye kind sir
[15:03] <Snowman> No problem
[15:04] <vurtual> It's not nuking them from orbit if it's not the only way to be sure!
[15:04] <Konogan> I'm pretty sure they'll never rebel in fact.
[15:04] <Azathoth> you'll have a black and white style hand to control the game
[15:04] <vurtual> control wether they have women!
[15:04] <Azathoth> and a large variety of objects that you can 'spawn' in the world
[15:04] <vurtual> make them forcably into a society about rape
[15:04] <Azathoth> and the ability to modify the environment
[15:04] <vurtual> Azathoth, anything you could script and model
[15:04] <Azathoth> and introduce other species or populations
[15:04] <vurtual> the programmers would be the strongest
[15:04] <Azathoth> vurtual, yes!
[15:05] <vurtual> create plagues or hillariously buggy worlds
[15:05] <bildramer> lol
[15:05] <Azathoth> world creation would definitely be a part of it
[15:05] <Azathoth> you could create really harsh environments
[15:05] <Azathoth> or paradise
[15:05] <Konogan> Look at us, divine manifestation are nearly inexistant if not not at all. and there's a lot of people who still follows religion. imagine if we nearly act in their life everyday...
[15:05] <vurtual> Their own ability to revolt would be influenced by noticing these bugs out of place, anti-social ones would notice erratic behaivor in "normal" things and be attuned to hidden parsing errors
[15:05] <vurtual> Forget a } and you get Neo.
[15:05] <Konogan> rebellions are unlikely.
[15:06] <Konogan> wasn't it a ,?
[15:06] <Azathoth> no bugs. i want a simulation D:
[15:06] <bildramer> vurtual: forget a } and you get compiler errors
[15:06] <vurtual> they notice errors
[15:06] <vurtual> they feel the disturbance in the force
[15:06] <bildramer> it won't compile
[15:06] <bildramer> dude
[15:06] <bildramer> lo
[15:06] <vurtual> granted any rebellion can just be nuked
[15:06] <bildramer> l
[15:06] <vurtual> scripting.

[15:06] <Azathoth> lol
[15:06] <vurtual> Darkfire002, he just left
[15:06] <Azathoth> no
[15:07] <vurtual> his quit message was one second before you
[15:07] <Darkfire002> seriously...
[15:07] <Konogan> :\
[15:07] <vurtual> actually aronud ten seconds
[15:07] <Darkfire002> no not seriously
[15:07] <Konogan> Sorry dude.
[15:07] <vurtual> 7 at least
[15:07] <Darkfire002> realy
[15:07] <Azathoth> anyway, fun conversation guys
[15:07] <Azathoth> cya around
[15:07] <Darkfire002> god damn it
[15:07] <vurtual> yes
[15:07] <Konogan> Bye.
[15:07] <Darkfire002> what did he say?
[15:07] <bildramer> really
[15:07] <vurtual> bye Azathoth <3
[15:07] <bildramer> gulliblity
[15:07] <Konogan> Nothing much
[15:07] <vurtual> Darkfire002, he said things about the mp beta
[15:07] <bildramer> wtf
[15:07] <vurtual> joking though
[15:07] <Konogan> SHHH
[15:07] <vurtual> he's working on some new compo thing
[15:07] <Konogan> Dude man
[15:07] <Darkfire002> didnt think he was here
[15:07] <bildramer> How the hell can you believe them
[15:07] <Darkfire002> wll
[15:07] <Darkfire002> well
[15:08] <Darkfire002> thinking about the time in sweeden right now dosent seem to unbelievable so i inquired
[15:08] <Konogan> Yeah.
[15:08] <vurtual> And then he commented on bildramer's new bike
[15:08] <Konogan> he didn't come
[15:08] <Darkfire002> i didnt actualy "believe" them
[15:08] <Darkfire002> k
[15:08] <Darkfire002> well
[15:08] <bildramer> I don't have a bike
[15:08] <bildramer> :l
[15:08] <Darkfire002> Perhaps all floating chunks of blocks should fall down, except for a special block (obsidian?) that can be used to make floating things. Floating islands would need obsidian veins to stay afloat.
[15:08] <Darkfire002> there his words
[15:08] <Darkfire002> in his to do list
[15:08] <Darkfire002> i was wondering
[15:08] <bildramer> lol
[15:08] <Darkfire002> say you have,
[15:08] <bildramer> -vurtual- yes you do it's that new red one with the 24-speds
[15:08] <Darkfire002> this is a defence mechanism ive got in my places
[15:08] <vurtual> herpes?
[15:08] <Darkfire002> a glass roof
[15:08] <bildramer> :P
[15:08] <Darkfire002> then you place a wooden block ontop of the glass roo
[15:09] <Darkfire002> roof
[15:09] <Darkfire002> then, you delete the block that is directly below the wooden block
[15:09] <Darkfire002> do the supports from all diagonals count as support?
[15:09] <Darkfire002> what i do is i set that wooden block on fire
[15:09] <vurtual> How would we know!?
[15:09] <Darkfire002> and it catches
[15:09] <Darkfire002> well if u see him ask...

[18:12] * Jake strolls in
[18:12] <Jake> what's going on here then?
[18:12] <Superwafflez> You play as a viking teleported into a modern city. It will be like Grand Theft Auto in the sense that you can roam around freely, but there are no missions, there is no currency, and the only goal is to fuck everything up. You go around breaking shit around the city, you can hijack shit and crash it into shit.
[18:12] <Madtoaster> :O
[18:12] <Madtoaster> AWESOME
[18:12] * Snowman (Snowman@sd51100a0.adsl.wanadoo.nl) has joined #minecraft
[18:13] <Madtoaster> THAT IS BEYOND AWESOME
[18:13] <Madtoaster> THAT IS BETTER THAN FURRY PORN
[18:13] <Madtoaster> Wait.
[18:13] <Madtoaster> I didnt say that.
[18:13] <Superwafflez> One of your weapons should be screaming. If you scream at someone hard enough, they become a viking too and assist you in fucking shit up. You can either be elaborate in fucking shit up, or you can do it the simple way. For example, you hear about a business meeting in the 20th floor of an office building. You can take the elevator up to the floor and burst in with your posse and fuck shit up, or construct a giant ramp
[18:13] <Superwafflez> You win when the entire city is rubble, you fucked all the shit up, or if everyone is a viking.
[18:13] <Madtoaster> This is a real game.
[18:13] <Madtoaster> Isnt it?
[18:13] <Superwafflez> Nope.
[18:14] <Madtoaster> ...

[18:15] <blaster> If it has 3d graphics
[18:15] <Madtoaster> Aww
[18:15] <blaster> And is actualy decent
[18:16] <blaster> 2D GTA is SHIT
[18:16] <Madtoaster> ITS NOT
[18:16] <Madtoaster> ITS..
[18:16] <shapeshiftr> haha, Madtoaster, now I'm going to steal your game design and get rich, Rich, RICH!

[18:16] <Superwafflez> The viking with a fucking electric guitar with fucking viking horn shit on it.
[18:16] <Superwafflez> When you play it it makes peoples heads blow the fuck up and makes cars explode.
[18:16] <Superwafflez> You can pevlic thrust. When directed at a woman she instantly has a baby, which grows up to be a viking.

[18:17] <Madtoaster> Like, Hey, doods, I make a protatype game.
[18:17] <Madtoaster> They are like "Cool"
[18:18] <shapeshiftr> I would develop one, but my GPU lack... pixel shader 1.1... Dx
[18:18] <Madtoaster> And I am like, I make it better when I can play Warhammer Kthxbai
[18:18] <ZomBuster> it lacks pixel shader.. 1.1? lol
[18:18] <blaster> And attaching Chainsaws to your feet and using them as stilts

[18:18] <shapeshiftr> yeah, ZomBuster, not even 3.0...1.1....
[18:18] <Superwafflez> You should get a battle cry that can only be used after you fuck up enough shit and it causes everything around you to shake, people explode and buildings collapse. While this is happening, you have an epic rage face on.
[18:19] <blaster> The final weapon you have is the nuclear mjolnir which you get by killing thor
[18:19] <shapeshiftr> epic rage causes everyones' clothes to burst off epicly.
[18:19] <Roadcrosser> hmm
[18:19] <Roadcrosser> ...
[18:19] <Superwafflez> This game isn't just blowing shit up, it's fucking shit up. Meaning that you can go crazy and tear down buildings using only your lungs, or you can break into houses (leaving a viking shaped hole) and steal presents from under a Christmas tree then burn them as a sacrifice to Odin who will cause a tsunami. This will result in a destroyed and flooded section of city in which you can stop rescue vehicles from saving surviv
[18:20] <shapeshiftr> Raping the first lady!
[18:20] <blaster> How about being able to teleport anywhere, including INSIDE PEOPLE

[18:20] <blaster> so they explode and you pop out
[18:20] <shapeshiftr> ^^
[18:20] <Superwafflez> How about using people as teleport points.
[18:21] <Superwafflez> Downside of teleporting is that you kill someone important to a part of the game.
[18:21] <blaster> I am copying all dis shit to notepad
[18:21] <Superwafflez> Upside: convenience.
[18:21] <Superwafflez> blaster youll be rich man
[18:21] <shapeshiftr> how about sacrificing people to odin for booze!
[18:21] <Superwafflez> no point
[18:21] <Superwafflez> just fuck shit up at the bar
[18:22] <Superwafflez> anyway id better go
[18:22] <shapeshiftr> it's god-booze, though.
[18:22] <shapeshiftr> later wafflez

[20:06] <Ickum> A bottle of jack will do nicely XD
[20:06] <Ickum> Or you know minecraft multiplayer xD
[20:06] <blaster> Who should I make my sherrif? My millitary captain or my bookkeeper/leader
[20:06] <Ickum> anyway..
[20:06] <Ickum> I've never played dwarf fortress O.o

[20:07] <blaster> Ok
[20:07] <blaster> So my best millitary dwarf?
[20:07] <blaster> Or some random shit headed lazy person
[20:07] <Owner> Honestly, this guy probably won't see much action
[20:07] <Owner> so

[20:07] <blaster> K
[20:08] <blaster> My clothier will do nicely
[20:08] <blaster> I have no plan in setting up a cloth industry
[20:08] <Owner> It's a good export item.
[20:08] <Owner> specially if you grow dyes
[20:08] <blaster> I dont
[20:08] <blaster> Thats the problem
[20:08] <Owner> it effectivley doubles the value of the clothing
[20:08] <blaster> I will stick to metal thanks
[20:08] <Owner> if i'm not mistaken
[20:09] <blaster> Smelting is very profitable due to all the ligonite lying around
[20:09] <Owner> well, no it doesn't multiply it, but it has a quality modifer, which multiplies the base value that's added
[20:10] <Owner> I play(ed) 40d with Dig Deeper, most of my metalworks stayed in-fortress.
[20:11] <blaster> Dig Deeper?

[20:18] <Christoph> The list goes one.
[20:18] <Christoph> on*
[20:18] <blaster> Or maby I have not played long enough for something execcively fun
[20:18] <Christoph> It's only after several months in that I realize I didn't make them.
[20:18] <Owner> Yeah, Vanilla DF 40D is a bit easy. Goblin Seiges don't happen for a long time, and when they do you are ready.
[20:19] <Christoph> By that time the dorfs are licking the old barrels clean in an effort to get the last few drops.
[20:19] <Owner> Try Dig Deeper if you want a real challenge, blaster.
[20:19] <blaster> 2010 adventure mode just takes the piss
[20:19] <bildramer> lol
[20:19] <blaster> Killing legandary axedwarfs in 1 hit with a new character
[20:19] <Owner> Yeah, but Adventure mode in 31.03 is way more fun, with the new underground.
[20:19] <blaster> If you get there
[20:20] <Owner> Not hard, just go a cave or an old fort that's dug down far enough.

[20:20] <blaster> Should I arrange a fun little accident
[20:21] <AzureAngelic> i dont have dedicated haulers

[20:21] <blaster> AzureAngelic I have too many, they are just eating everything I have
[20:21] <blaster> The eating isnt the problem, its the drinking
[20:21] <Christoph> Better than a hammerer at least.
[20:21] <Owner> Much, MUCH better than a hammerer
[20:21] <Owner> though, worse than an ARMLESS hammerer

[20:23] <blaster> 21 in 1 season is MENTAL
[20:23] <AzureAngelic> also i cant tell if i have a good fortress location
[20:23] <blaster> My fortress location is excelent
[20:23] <blaster> About 1/2 of the rock is magnetite, a great iron ore
[20:23] <AzureAngelic> on one hand its in a really nice canyon
[20:23] <Owner> Sand? Flux? River/Brook? Magma pipe/pool? Underground river/pool?

[20:24] <Owner> Then no worries.
[20:24] <AzureAngelic> im planning to get a wall up once i have more masons
[20:24] <blaster> Yes I have flux and a brook. I also have ligonite (Coal substitute)
[20:24] <AzureAngelic> and a drawbridge and stuff
[20:24] <Owner> I mean Seiges don't happen 'till atleast year 5
[20:25] <blaster> How about goblin raids
[20:25] <Owner> Ambusher's anywhere from year 2-4. But there isn't much you can do about them. They usually aren't that bad.
[20:26] <blaster> Owner do I have to make a bedroom owned
[20:26] <blaster> Or will someone go over to it on their own
[20:26] <blaster> And begin owning it
[20:26] <Owner> when possible however, try to keep most of your dwarf's inside a walled area or the fort proper, and have marksdwarfs on towers around the entance.
[20:26] <Christoph> Oh dear, Mark fell into the vat again.
[20:26] <Owner> If you make it a bedroom

[20:26] <blaster> that helps

[20:27] <Owner> and since the other rooms are probably all the same, no need t worry about it.
[20:27] <blaster> Actualy I have 2 catogories of rooms
[20:27] <blaster> 2x2 and 1x2
[20:28] <blaster> The 2x2 are owned by my original 7

[20:57] <vurtual> Houses in real life can be rotated any direction.
[20:57] <Visiiri> http://www.dogcentral.info/yoga-dogs/#2
[20:57] <vurtual> They technically have no grid to be aligned to, whatsoever.
[20:57] <Visiiri> I'm stumbling.
[20:58] <vurtual> So all our houses are randomly scattered, unless they were intentionally made to do things like ailgn with north/south/east/west

[20:59] <Visiiri> I've been to Himeji Castle.
[21:00] <Owner> Yes well. You can apply that to pretty much anything.
[21:00] <Owner> i mean
[21:00] <Owner> in space, there is no direction as we know it
[21:00] <Owner> Evertying is relative.
[21:00] <Owner> Even Relaivity.
[21:00] <vurtual> There's concepts like "down" though.
[21:00] <vurtual> Which is towards whatever rock we're being pulled at
[21:01] <ZomBuster> so down would actually be "the direction with the most gravitational force"
[21:01] <Visiiri> Badass otw: http://badassoftheweek.com/aki-ra.html
[21:01] <ZomBuster> actually that wouldn't work either
[21:01] <vurtual> And then there's slightly larger concepts of "down" like the distance "below" our solar system's plane, defined by our south pole.
[21:02] <Owner> You are still speaking in relativistic terms
[21:02] <vurtual> Yeah, but down's still a concept.
[21:02] <Snowman> Direction in space is based on perspective
[21:02] <vurtual> North is also relative, but having a nice grid for buildings looks nice okay!

[21:03] <Owner> It's all still relative.
[21:03] <vurtual> But my house could be at an odd angle with another house 100 feet away
[21:04] <vurtual> Owner, how long you live on this planet to something not moving is relative to how fast the planet decides to go.

[21:09] <AlexVMiner> Right 3 Meinkrapht

[21:27] <Phileep> people know not to touch the sacred AlexVMiner name
[21:27] <Snowman> Stop humping each other
[21:27] <blaster> @Owner In 2342, the wizard Arkanadir Morlavator developed a new race: the dreaded three-humped camel. This quickly set off a cascade of imitators, and it wasn't 2 years later that the 4-humped camel was produced. A competition, at first friendly but later becoming ferocious came about to develop the camel with the most humps. This finally ending in 2478 with Mogaria Fornenzon's development of the limbless, headless 18-humped camel which died immediately
[21:27] <blaster> ryone decided breeding camels with ridiculous numbers of humps was a stupid idea.

[21:31] <vurtual> in df you can make an 18 humped camel
[21:31] <AlexVMiner> just to let you know i won't pay attention
[21:31] <vurtual> you can just give them a one-part body and a bunch of humps for limbs
[21:31] <vurtual> Seeing humps on their headhump.
[21:31] <vurtual> An eating hump, flying hump, walking hump, breeding hump.
[21:31] <blaster> Breeding hump
[21:31] <blaster> lolol
[21:31] <vurtual> So you get the image of a camel loosely made from many, many various shape humps.
[21:32] <Brolapse> Do they manage to survive?
[21:32] <Marach-14> after watching all those smw romhacks playthroughs, i'm afraid to play it
[21:32] <blaster> Anyway the only reason dwarf fortress could get more realistic is [left testicle] and [right testicle]
[21:32] <vurtual> They have flying humps!
[21:32] <Brolapse> Or do they starve ro death?
[21:32] <vurtual> eating humps
[21:32] <Darnest> omg I can't find any gravel
[21:32] <vurtual> If dwarves had some kind of reproductive organ, blaster, that'd be there
[21:32] <blaster> The left testicle is loped off
[21:32] <blaster> Ow...
[21:32] <vurtual> and the individual nerves could get cut
[21:32] <vurtual> or damaged
[21:32] <Brolapse> It's just I wouldn't imagine eating with a hump would be effective
[21:32] <vurtual> grab them
[21:32] <vurtual> pinch, rip... fondle?
[21:33] <blaster> The dwarfs reproductive organ is his beard
[21:33] <vurtual> trimm
[21:33] <blaster> A kobold grappels your penis
[21:33] <vurtual> They just sorta stick their hump into the food and absorb it while going MMMMMMMMMMHHHH
[21:33] <Brolapse> Hahaha
[21:33] <vurtual> Shaped just like a camel, except their feet are now sorta flatter humps, as is their eyes and nose, and the front of their face.
[21:33] <vurtual> and they hover
[21:34] <Brolapse> Anti-gravity hump?
[21:34] <vurtual> repulsorhumps

[21:34] <vurtual> Marach-14, it's all defined
[21:34] <vurtual> in the raws
[21:34] <vurtual> Infact if I did this, every last thing would be attached in the proper location, and that'd play into it
[21:34] <vurtual> and how tough the humps are
[21:34] <vurtual> where's that site that suggests randomly-generated food items? I'm hungry
[21:35] <Marach-14> if i wanted to use imagination, i would play interactive fiction >:(
[21:35] <vurtual> Marach-14, facade.
[21:35] <vurtual> Nothing to imagine
[21:35] <vurtual> It has voice acting and graphics and a 3D world
[21:35] <vurtual> granted there's no actual interaction on the third dimension besides... sitting at one place
[21:35] <vurtual> The voice acting is pretty functional, they sound pretty human.
[21:36] <Marach-14> i know the world is 3d
[21:36] <vurtual> like a human who doesn't get out enough.
[21:36] <vurtual> ..or have a TV

[22:01] <killer2329> i dont see why gold cant be an impromptu currency
[22:01] <AlexVMiner> lol
[22:01] <blaster> In a case of a nuke it should simply delete whole 16x16 chunks instead of doing it the normal way
[22:01] <Darnest> Notch needs to make some other method of travel

[22:01] <Owner_> Mounts!

[22:01] <Owner_> Id love to ride a pig
[22:01] <blaster> Mine carts are a yes
[22:01] <vede> killer2329, the game doesn't have to control what is and isn't currency.
[22:01] <Darnest> nah, mounts are a stupid id
[22:01] * Owner_ is now known as Calhoun
[22:01] <Darnest> mine cart would be good
[22:01] <vede> That's what makes Minecraft awesome.
[22:01] <Darnest> idea*

[22:02] <killer2329> but no one else wants to use it because its "useless"
[22:02] <AlexVMiner> since they already had 2 or 3
[22:02] <bildramer> lol
[22:02] <blaster> At the moment I have a leather armor making industry
[22:02] <vede> killer2329, so why would they want to if it was considered currency?
[22:03] <vede> You think people will suddenly be rushing for gold because the game says that it's currency?
[22:03] <blaster> But I am hoping to switch to a metal industry soon

[22:03] <killer2329> vede i'm thinking of why it was in the ancient past it was rare extremely rare
[22:04] <vede> killer2329, it's pretty rare in Minecraft too.
[22:04] <blaster> Gold is useless
[22:04] * Owner (Owner@c-24-129-63-241.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[22:04] <blaster> In the past is was INSANELY RARE
[22:04] <Darnest> seriously, I'm getting bored of infdev now
[22:04] <killer2329> thats the point rarity induces value
[22:04] <Darnest> there's nothing to collect
[22:04] * Owner_ (Owner@c-24-129-63-241.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[22:04] <blaster> So it was not realy profitable to mine it for the sake of turning it into counterfit couns
[22:04] <Darnest> that's remotely useful
[22:04] <blaster> Coins
[22:04] <vede> So killer2329, what are you trying to say?
[22:04] <blaster> which was the whole point of coins back then
[22:04] <Brolapse> How many diamonds do you have, Darnest?
[22:05] <blaster> I think stacks of 64 stone will be used as standard currency
[22:05] <blaster> Because its value is time
[22:05] <Darnest> Brolapse: none because they are useless
[22:05] <Owner_> there doesn't need to be a currency. I mean, you're not going to need it.
[22:05] <Darnest> Brolapse: no point in mining for them
[22:05] <killer2329> thats gold has a use as some form of currency it dosent need another use what else can you use a dollar bill for?

[22:06] <vede> killer2329, so what's stopping you from using some sort of currency in Minecraft?

[22:06] <Brolapse> Pillaging
[22:06] <killer2329> no one else wanting to use it
[22:06] <Darnest> Gold is only a currency in real life because they use it in electronics
[22:06] <blaster> guys people just use currency as a middle man for trades
[22:06] <Calhoun> Darnest: Lulwut?
[22:06] <bildramer> http://www.flickr.com/photos/bibliodyssey/4566818501/sizes/o/
[22:06] <bildramer> whoa
[22:06] <blaster> I trade wood for gold then trade gold for stone
[22:06] <vurtual> there should be a tf2 achievement called maggonot line
[22:06] <blaster> Which is the same as trading wood for stone
[22:07] <Brolapse> Gold was used as a currency far before electricity existed though
[22:07] <vede> killer2329, well, you're not supposed to USE currency, now are you?
[22:07] <killer2329> darnest did they have electricity in the viking times the ROMAN times
[22:07] <vurtual> For winning a game without any opposing captures, having defended 3-5 times..

[22:07] <killer2329> vede thats my point
[22:07] <Darnest> killer2329: yes they did
[22:07] <vede> killer2329, what's your point?
[22:08] <blaster> A standard currency would make stores easier to run
[22:08] <Darnest> killer2329: what did you think they used their roads for?
[22:08] <Calhoun> blaster: why would you want to run a store in minecraft?
[22:08] <blaster> Because if a store only accepted pork to be used to buy things
[22:08] <vede> killer2329, do you think that if Minecraft, the game, says that "GOLD IS CURRENCY," people will suddenly be trying to barter with gold?
[22:08] <Darnest> killer2329: the romans were well known for their roads
[22:08] <killer2329> people wine " why use gold as a currency its useless" i'm trying to prove that most currency is useless except as for a currency
[22:08] <blaster> Then not everyone will be able to shop

[22:08] <Darnest> killer2329: roads would be pretty useless without cars
[22:08] <blaster> You set up a store to sell excess goods
[22:08] <blaster> Like if your a miner you might set up a ore shop
[22:08] <blaster> In a local town
[22:08] <vede> killer2329, did anyone say that HERE?

[22:09] <Calhoun> blaster: but it's not like anyones LIMITED to what they can do, there isn't a point to an economy if everyone can be enganged in every industry.
[22:09] <vede> Or did you just try to spark up an argument from something you saw in the forums.
[22:09] <killer2329> just trying to spread an idea
[22:09] <blaster> Calhoun someone who has a deeper mine is at an advantage to someone with a surface mine
[22:09] <killer2329> and kill a stupid one
[22:09] <Brolapse> I think multiplayer survival will be far too chaotic for stored to succeed
[22:10] <Brolapse> *stores
[22:10] <blaster> Brolapse dont forget that since its paid only
[22:10] <blaster> Quite alot of us will be sensable
[22:10] <Calhoun> blaster: But it's not like they are limited to their mine size. They can do anything they want.
[22:10] <vede> killer2329, it's pretty difficult to spread an idea to people who already agree with it, and kill an idea that no one has.
[22:10] <Yourself> <Calhoun> blaster: But it's not like they are limited to their mine size. They can do anything they want.
[22:10] <Yourself> given time

[22:10] <Brolapse> True, it will be a LOT better than creative. But I still stand by my point
[22:10] <Yourself> and which different people would rather spend on different things
[22:11] <blaster> If notch adds differnt biomes to infdev then trade WILL happen
[22:11] <blaster> some standard currency will make it easier, either a player set one or a actual gold coin
[22:11] <Calhoun> blaster: They can just move out of their biome, or maintain residence in multiple biomes.
[22:11] * Eythor (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[22:11] <blaster> If players had the option of making gold coins it would be easier
[22:11] <vede> I think that in MP, ores should be determined by region, such that in one area (a pretty big area, like enough area to to cover a city and most of the city's surroundings) there's coal, and in another there's iron, and in most there's nothing.
[22:11] <blaster> And calhoun after building a house out of 200 stone its not easy to get to a differnt region
[22:11] <Brolapse> 1 bar crafts 5 coins?
[22:12] <blaster> I think regions should be 512-1024 blocks across
[22:12] <vede> That way you'd actually have to venture out and set up remote mines, and trading between cities for their two ores would actually be useful.
[22:12] <Brolapse> They should be huge
[22:12] <blaster> 1 bar crafts 9 coins
[22:12] <Brolapse> Why 9?
[22:12] <blaster> Because 9 bars creates a block
[22:12] <Brolapse> Ah
[22:12] <blaster> keeping everything as multiples of 9 is therefore better
[22:12] <vede> ^^ consistency ftw
[22:12] <killer2329> vede i completely agree except one thing it would be harder than hell to find where the ore is
[22:12] <Yourself> that means a bar of gold is only worth 9 coins
[22:12] <Darnest> killer2329: cars have BATTERIES in them
[22:12] <vede> killer2329, yeah, so?
[22:13] <Darnest> killer2329: batteries use ELECTRICITY
[22:13] <vede> That makes it GOOD.
[22:13] <AlexVMiner> i wanna play spleef...
[22:13] <blaster> It means iron ore would be worth about 5 coins, stone about 1 for 32, coal 1 coin, porn 1/2 a coin ect...
[22:13] <blaster> You can already begins working out average prices

[22:13] <Yourself> well, the choice is arbitrary
[22:14] <Yourself> i just don't like things dipping into fractional prices
[22:14] <Darnest> if they didn't have cars they wouldn't have built roads : /
[22:14] <blaster> Diamond would be worth about 50 coins
[22:14] <blaster> Yourself you would buy more than one
[22:14] <Darnest> you can't ride a horse across Europe

[22:15] <AzureAngelic> i have a tame rhesus macaque, if i throw it in a farm and wait for it to have babies will they be tame or will they steal my stuff
[22:15] <AlexVMiner> i want at least 3 people playing
[22:15] <Yourself> buying multiples isn't a solution
[22:15] <vurtual> I was carrying the intel, which our team really needed

[22:15] <vurtual> I was one of the best playerson the team
[22:15] <Yourself> you may as well scale the value of coins so you don't get fractional prices
[22:15] <Brolapse> Rather than, "You drop 30 coins and I drop 100 coal. 3...2...1...GO!"
[22:15] <blaster> Yourself stone will most likely be used as a currency without coins
[22:15] <killer2329> blaster agreed
[22:15] <Yourself> yeah, it probably will
[22:16] <blaster> Trading stacks of 64 for things like a iron pickaxe
[22:16] <Yourself> i like the idea of coins better because they're smaller and it makes more sense to have them stored in a specialized inventory slot

[22:16] <AzureAngelic> i think coins would be better

[22:17] <Brolapse> Breakable?

[22:17] <ThomasBags> well I'm not dead
[22:17] <AzureAngelic> blaster agreed

[22:17] <Darnest> killer2329: you just don't know geography
[22:17] <Darnest> killer2329: Europe is big,
[22:17] <AzureAngelic> i want someone to be able to see my diamonds without actually having to use them on a breakable item
[22:17] <blaster> Rule 1 of minecraft. EVERY BLOCK MUST BE BREAKABLE
[22:17] <Brolapse> Diamond + glass = reinforced glass?
[22:17] <blaster> otherwise people could trap people forever
[22:17] <killer2329> omfg darnest STFU
[22:18] <AzureAngelic> but yeah
[22:18] <Darnest> ok, tell me this
[22:18] <killer2329> no
[22:18] <Darnest> if gold wasn't usefule
[22:18] <AzureAngelic> diamond+glass=invincible glass could work
[22:18] <Darnest> why would anyone use it as currency?
[22:18] <AzureAngelic> i mean who would waste their diamonds to trap people lol
[22:18] <Darnest> it's only currency because it is useful in electronics
[22:18] <killer2329> because its rare and therefore hard to fake
[22:18] <Brolapse> The ability to build unbreakable blocks is OP
[22:18] <Darnest> but why would anyone want it?
[22:18] <Yourself> because it's pretty
[22:19] <AzureAngelic> darnest, my idea was you trade stacks of 64 stone for maybe 5 coins or something
[22:19] <Yourself> the gold standard was around long before electronics
[22:19] <killer2329> why do people want oneof a kind things?
[22:19] <Darnest> have you even seen gold? it's ugly
[22:19] <AzureAngelic> and you can trade gold for a lot more
[22:19] <Yourself> and long before there was any practical industrial use for it
[22:19] <Yourself> people wanted gold because it was shiny and looked good

[22:23] <blaster> But we do need more tool tiers
[22:23] <Yourself> diamond is brittle, so it's prone to shattering on impact
[22:23] <Darnest> Minecraft should have artifact items that don't break and have special abilities
[22:24] <Darnest> that would be cool
[22:24] <blaster> Like a very low chance of making an artifact
[22:24] <Darnest> nah, you would have to find them

[22:26] <Calhoun> What you really need is just more thins in general to do. More metals to mine, more things to create.
[22:26] <Darnest> we should be able to enslave zombies

[22:26] <AlexVMiner> lol
[22:26] <vede> AlexVMiner, illegal character crash.
[22:26] <Yourself> <blaster> But the bonus is like the difference between 0% and 1% chance
[22:26] <AlexVMiner> the whole server crashed?
[22:27] <vede> No.
[22:27] <Yourself> that's a massive difference
[22:27] <vede> It just crashes clients.
[22:27] <AlexVMiner> oh
[22:27] <blaster> I know its a huge increace
[22:27] <AlexVMiner> xD
[22:27] <blaster> But after 1 creation it might be like 0.5%
[22:27] <AlexVMiner> did YOU crash my client?
[22:27] <blaster> Then after 10 0.6%
[22:27] <AlexVMiner> i remember that was possible
[22:27] <vede> You know, I'm okay with custom servers and all that, but when people are going around pulling crap like this because they prefer custom servers, it makes me want to hurt people.
[22:27] <blaster> 100 0.7 1000 0.8 10000 0.9
[22:27] <AlexVMiner> wait wut
[22:27] <blaster> The increase is so small grinding past 100 is a waste of material
[22:28] <AlexVMiner> i hate custom servers
[22:28] <Yourself> doesn't matter, the more you do it, the more chances you have of getting whatever
[22:28] <AlexVMiner> was that directed towards me?

[22:28] <vede> *did that
[22:28] <Yourself> the probability could be a fixed 0.5% after the first item
[22:28] <blaster> Who will make 99,000 wood pickaxes to increace the chance of making an artifact by 0.1%
[22:28] <Schaap> AlexVMiner, why do you hate custom servers?
[22:28] <AlexVMiner> they are polluting the game
[22:28] <AlexVMiner> the game is about building
[22:28] <Yourself> <blaster> Who will make 99,000 wood pickaxes to increace the chance of making an artifact by 0.1%
[22:28] <blaster> Because not only is it a waste of materials, its a waste of time
[22:28] <Yourself> no one
[22:29] <AlexVMiner> not about fancy ranks and functions
[22:29] <Yourself> they'd do it to get the artifact
[22:29] <vede> I hate playing on them, but I don't fecking antagonize people who do.
[22:29] <blaster> Doing it to get the artifact is fine
[22:29] <blaster> Thats ok
[22:29] <vede> *do play on them
[22:29] <blaster> thats part of the game
[22:29] <Yourself> then it's grinding
[22:29] <blaster> Like grinding stone mining in the hope you get diamond
[22:29] <Yourself> except there it's not strictly a matter of time or quantity
[22:29] <Schaap> i like it because of the help it gives some builders.
[22:29] <AlexVMiner> I wasn't saying you were
[22:30] <Yourself> it's a matter of area
[22:30] <AlexVMiner> i just thought you were joking because i won the spleef
[22:30] <AlexVMiner> and you crashed me
[22:30] <Schaap> i could not give my current builders the oppertunity to build the goldengate bridge with the vanilla server
[22:30] <Visiiri> Soo..
[22:30] <Visiiri> Is anyone hiring a music composer?

[22:37] <Calhoun> Bloodshot: Nah, you just gotta be willing to hole yourself in the first night or two.

[22:38] <Calhoun> Snowman:
[22:38] <blaster> Crops can die
[22:38] <Calhoun> They can?
[22:38] <blaster> On infdev they dont
[22:38] <Snowman> This is infdev
[22:38] <blaster> But soil without crops can disapear
[22:39] <blaster> So make sure its fully planted and animals dont trample it
[22:39] <Bloodshot> True
[22:39] <Snowman> I'll hit the sheep with my stick
[22:39] <Bloodshot> Lol.
[22:39] <Snowman> And maybe make a fence later

[22:39] <blaster> That ALWAYS works
[22:39] <Bloodshot> They can jump over that.

[22:42] <blaster> No
[22:42] <Bloodshot> :(
[22:42] <blaster> I think that will be in the final version
[22:42] <blaster> when lua is added
[22:42] <Bloodshot> :)
[22:42] <Jat> if he uses lua
[22:42] <blaster> Which in my oppinion will ruin the game because it will take hours to learn how a new server works
[22:42] <vurtual> Hey Uk-peoples!
[22:42] <vurtual> You're getting mountain dew again!
[22:42] <blaster> And they will all be terrible as well
[22:42] <blaster> FUCK i hate mountain dew
[22:42] <Bloodshot> I've looked at Lua before.
[22:42] <blaster> Sprite FTW
[22:43] <blaster> I have used lua a bit, mostly for mathmatical functions
[22:43] <Bloodshot> Me 2
[22:43] <Jat> blaster thats like saying halflife mods will be awful because youll have to spend hours learning each one
[22:43] <Bloodshot> About sprite
[22:43] <Yourself> i'd rather it was python
[22:43] <blaster> Jat finding a standard server would be impossible
[22:43] <Yourself> but if i have to learn a new language, i will
[22:43] <Visiiri> No, really, is there anywhere good to host music?
[22:43] <blaster> I barely know any lua
[22:43] <blaster> Just enough to do simple stuff
[22:43] <Visiiri> So that it can be streamed online of course.
[22:43] <Yourself> i don't know any
[22:44] <Yourself> but it won't take long to learn

[22:44] <Visiiri> I've uploaded eight of my songs there, they don't appear.
[22:44] <blaster> told you snowman
[22:44] <Jat> blaster most likely most servers will just just use one or more popular server mods so there will still be a great deal of homogeneity
[22:44] <vurtual> Anyways it's funny to hear what foreigners think of the stuff I drink in illogical amounts every day
[22:44] <Bloodshot> Lol. Build an enterance from the roof of your base.
[22:45] <Jat> there will most likely be about two or three freely available server mods that are popular that a server with no custom stuff can choose to use
[22:45] <Jat> then there will be some completely custom servers
[22:45] <Jat> but you can avoid those
[22:46] <Bloodshot> I like addons that don't change gameplay

[22:49] <AlexVMiner> Notch's script is what i call it
[22:49] <AlexVMiner> it is a script
