[0:29] <Drewseph> well thats a bug
[0:29] <Vaugher> I don't care about naturally, as long as I can squeeze it into my inventory on the map I'm on.
[0:29] <Iguana> Cheat Engine works.
[0:29] <Drewseph> anyone have a hard crash (black screen) on placing a torch?
[0:29] <Drewseph> er, hard java crash
[0:29] <Iguana> Nope.
[0:29] <Drewseph> not a computer crash
[0:30] <Vaugher> I'll check it out. Is Cheat Engine newb friendly or really complicated?
[0:30] <Naxza> Haven't made a torch yet. Has the map generator made a dirt-less rock formation for anyone else?

[0:31] <Drewseph> the game screen goes black
[0:31] <Drewseph> and I must refresh the page
[0:31] <applecrisp> It's Notch telling us that torches are for wimps, use furnaces!

[0:33] <CruelNoise> seriously, whoever felt the, need to put such a device there really needs to rethink their perspective.

[0:34] <bildramer> :l
[0:34] <bildramer> also, by the way
[0:34] <CruelNoise> cuss, i'm swearing too much.
[0:34] <Naxza> Rethink their perspective... Whoever thought, the sense of that, statement that should be, under normal circumbstances, be made, needs to re think their, perspective.
[0:34] <bildramer> has anyone ever tried Schroedinger's experiment?
[0:34] <bildramer> tried doing*
[0:34] <Naxza> I would if I had a cat and a hunk of uranium.
[0:34] * Kepper (Mibbit@insight.dsl.xmission.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:35] <CruelNoise> what do you mean tried doing?
[0:35] <bildramer> Actually, I need some device to isolate 2 uranium protongs
[0:35] <bildramer> ns
[0:35] <bildramer> what.
[0:35] <bildramer> nuclei*
[0:35] <Oth1> I think, that is, the way that, Shatner, talks alot.
[0:35] <Nuky_> We all know the outcome, and the experiment is dated, anyways. :V

[1:15] <Vis{ROTR2010}> omg
[1:16] <Vis{ROTR2010}> it's a Dark Light

[1:19] <LuciferZ> Jesus H Christ
[1:19] <vurtual> then ride around the world.

[1:19] <vurtual> snowman, hit e

[1:19] <vurtual> and stop hitting yourself
[1:20] <serp> vurtual: sounds like a very bad idea
[1:20] <vurtual> serp, the nuclear part or the ride around the world part?
[1:20] <serp> why would the laptop be built into the motorcycle?
[1:20] <vurtual> use it as a gps
[1:20] <serp> why not build in a gps
[1:20] <vurtual> because you couldn't just stop, sit there, and read digg, of course

[1:21] <vurtual> okay mounted in, and you can detach it
[1:21] <serp> and definitely read reddit instead of digg
[1:21] <Yourself> 50 FPS while standing still in infdev?
[1:21] <vurtual> digg has more content and looks nicer :colbert:
[1:21] <Yourself> wtf did notch do?
[1:22] <Snowman> He warned this version will have poor performance
[1:22] <vurtual> So like, the laptop's built into a safe slot, and if you slide it in, the panel on the front becomes the control.

[2:43] <vurtual> they raped them
[2:43] <CruelNoise> damn
[2:43] <vurtual> if their rape-tool was a meat cleaver
[2:43] <CruelNoise> too little imagery too late.
[2:43] <vurtual> also I think a song in prime 2 was a bit similar to the dark cave theme
[2:44] <vurtual> I just remember the tune itself
[2:44] <CruelNoise> was silver as good as you say gold was?
[2:44] <CruelNoise> what about crystal?

[2:46] <CruelNoise> i'll go find a map
[2:47] <Tommerry11> any one want a tour of my base?
[2:47] <vurtual> Silver Cave was near Blackthorn and Kanto, part of the mountain region between them
[2:47] <CruelNoise> ice path
[2:48] <vurtual> ice cave oh yeah that was
[2:48] <vurtual> that was irritating
[2:48] <CruelNoise> that pissed me off
[2:48] <CruelNoise> my friend was amazed i made it through in under ten minutes... or something like that, it was a while ago
[2:48] <vurtual> Nintendo sure loves slidey ice puzzles
[2:48] <vurtual> At least the oot ones let you walk around and plan
[2:49] <vurtual> but then again oot had all those random frustrating elements where a puzzle required you to set up a block agains ta wall so you can jump angularly
[2:49] <CruelNoise> heh
[2:49] <vurtual> and had a hard time pointing out hookshot spots
[2:49] <vurtual> I ran completely through the spirit temple every time I dropped down into the room
[2:50] <vurtual> and didn't get the middle route until after beating the game mostly
[2:50] <CruelNoise> i remember when i was little, playing used games on my used N64, those were hte kinds of puzzels that would make me give up and cry
[2:50] <CruelNoise> and because my folks hated videogames, they wouldn't help me.

[2:53] <vurtual> firstly, prime 2 was mega-nerfed
[2:54] <vurtual> as in, laughably easy
[2:54] <CruelNoise> WHAT.
[2:54] <CruelNoise> they changed it?
[2:54] <vurtual> the hardest mode, which requires beating the game to unlock, is still easier than the original prime 2
[2:54] <CruelNoise> WHY IN FUCK WOULD THEY DO THAT?
[2:54] <vurtual> Because noobs whined, dude.
[2:54] <vurtual> Noobs whined.
[2:54] <CruelNoise> screw nooobs!

[3:05] <CruelNoise> 'move things around?'
[3:06] <CruelNoise> could you elaborate?
[3:06] <Yourself> i don't think it counts as mating if you're not capable of actually bearing any offspring
[3:06] <vurtual> if you were to finger one it could move your hand around
[3:07] <vurtual> Yourself, well, what if you did it with a monkey?
[3:07] <vurtual> It wouldn't make kids either
[3:07] <vurtual> except this time it's like, a dolphin.
[3:07] <vurtual> the term's good enough
[3:07] <Yourself> that's not mating either
[3:07] <CruelNoise> so, what.
[3:07] <AlexVMiner> test
[3:07] <AlexVMiner> yayz
[3:07] <Yourself> i believe "having sex with" or "fucking" would be more appropriate
[3:07] <CruelNoise> are you saying that dolphins are the best pleasure-ers?

[3:08] <vurtual> lots of people do Dysgalt
[3:08] <vurtual> infact dolphins easily understand rape, one night stands, and long term relationships
[3:09] <CruelNoise> you just need to find a more compact aqualung, or reabreather
[3:09] <AlexVMiner> BAM THIS IS WEIRD

[3:09] <CruelNoise> rape, stand, or relationship?
[3:10] <vurtual> I dunno lol
[3:10] <vurtual> water about 2 feet deep works for mating

[3:25] <somethingggg> Anyone else finding minecraft unplayable again?
[3:25] <vurtual> anyways yeah dolphins rape, communicate, and such.
[3:25] <Tommerry11> which is better indev, or infdev (before update)
[3:25] <somethingggg> cause of the update
[3:25] <eritz> ...but for Biden, it was Tuesday
[3:25] <vurtual> so basically they're sea people now.
[3:25] <somethingggg> it's literally 1 frame per minute now
[3:25] <somethingggg> no exaggeration whatsoever
[3:26] <vurtual> quickly internet, speak with them and find their scientific discoveries if any
[3:26] <Tommerry11> something, i have a version of infdev before the update, no problems here :)
[3:26] <CruelNoise> do dolphins rape eachoter?
[3:26] <somethingggg> =c
[3:26] <CruelNoise> do dolphins whore?
[3:26] <somethingggg> that doesn't solve the problem of it being unplayable
[3:26] <outsomnia> Dolphins, tell me your secretsssss
[3:26] <Tommerry11> what do you mean then?
[3:26] <somethingggg> it makes me less and less likely to actually buy this game in the end
[3:27] <vurtual> CruelNoise we don't know yet
[3:27] <CruelNoise> no, seriously, do dolphins sell themselves, for food or whatever
[3:27] <vurtual> go ask some
[3:27] <Koko|MW2> Tommerry11
[3:27] <Koko|MW2> personally
[3:27] <Tommerry11> yea?
[3:27] <outsomnia> @something, too late for that now buddy, you've already paid for it.
[3:27] <Koko|MW2> I think infdev is prettier
[3:27] <vurtual> if they do, you might catch dolphin-herpes or somethin
[3:27] <Koko|MW2> but you can do more in indev
[3:27] <vurtual> do dolphins even HAVE STDs?
[3:27] <vurtual> That'd probably force them to be even more intelligent
[3:27] <vurtual> Also if only mermaids could result from mating, that'd be cool.
[3:27] <somethingggg> no i haven't
[3:27] <Tommerry11> yea, same, but i like infdev because the size of things you can make.

[3:28] <ClassiestMedic> How big

[3:28] <somethingggg> But if the end result of this game is that it can only be played with top tier computers
[3:28] <Koko|Minecraft> um well
[3:28] <somethingggg> then i'm not buying.
[3:28] <outsomnia> hey hey
[3:28] <somethingggg> try before you buy, faggots.
[3:28] <Koko|Minecraft> it's basically going to first be a hole until I hit lava.
[3:28] <Tommerry11> want to see my road?

[3:28] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[3:28] <outsomnia> It IS for the PC master race after all.
[3:28] <Koko|Minecraft> the hole is going to be 30x30 squares long

[3:29] <Yourself> define "top tier"

[3:31] <Yourself> but it's playable
[3:31] <Tommerry11> http://www.livestream.com/tommerry11sminecraft there see mah road.
[3:31] <vurtual> like fox and marth
[3:31] <somethingggg> Thats way beyond playable
[3:31] <somethingggg> I'll take even a constant 20 fps
[3:31] <Tommerry11> one sec.
[3:31] <somethingggg> But with this update it went from ~30 to .1fps
[3:31] <LuciferZ> Something, I'm playing on a laptop with a 'media accelerator' instead of a graphics card, and I manage about 15 fps in infdev.
[3:31] <vurtual> or meta knight
[3:31] <vurtual> wait waht
[3:32] <CruelNoise> i'ma go play games.
[3:32] <Topple> I have about a 30 at all times in Infdev
[3:32] <Yourself> i'ma go play this new dwarf fortress
[3:32] <outsomnia> I get around 60fps on tiniest view, now it just jumps between 30 and 0.05

[3:32] <Topple> 60fps on the tinest view;
[3:32] <outsomnia> Exactly.

[3:37] <Topple> Basically Outsomnia we traded new trees for broken torches
[3:37] <Topple> I'
[3:37] <LuciferZ> You know what's bad? Having scalpel on your desk and losing it.
[3:37] <outsomnia> And paypal managed to cut us off of our end of the bargain.
[3:37] <Topple> I
[3:37] <Topple> damn it
[3:38] <outsomnia> Ala saplings are inflicted with some sort of disease that causes them to die the instant they touch ground-
[3:38] <Topple> Just saying, building right now means that later in MP Survival you can load your maps
[3:38] <outsomnia> and violently burst into a nuclear reaction.
[3:38] <Topple> so build empire now, have fun later
[3:38] <LuciferZ> ...
[3:38] <LuciferZ> Holy shit
[3:38] <Topple> what
[3:38] <LuciferZ> I never realized that
[3:38] <outsomnia> Wait, so I can just load a map onto all the people that are still building?
[3:39] <LuciferZ> You're pretty fucking smart Topple
[3:39] <Topple> really now
[3:39] <rbos> alpha-quality software is buggy, live with it :)
[3:39] <Topple> If this is sarcasm I am sorry
[3:39] <LuciferZ> No it's not
[3:39] <Topple> ah
[3:39] <Topple> well
[3:39] <Animator> Haven't tried the new infdev yet. How are the trees?
[3:39] <Topple> your welcome
[3:39] <outsomnia> I'd still like know though, are we going to have the same type of game/server style right now or much more people on large public servers?
[3:39] <outsomnia> :|
[3:39] <rbos> the trees are effing gorgeous
[3:39] <rbos> I love it
[3:39] <Topple> Animator, the trees are cool
[3:39] <LuciferZ> Trees are awesome Animator.
[3:39] <rbos> and there's sand
[3:39] <LuciferZ> The rest of it is not.
[3:39] <Topple> BUT TORCHES ARE BROKEN
[3:39] <outsomnia> also heks
[3:39] <rbos> the forests are dark, moody, and dense
[3:40] <outsomnia> And choppy
[3:40] <Topple> We traded new trees for torches that crash the app when placed
[3:40] <LuciferZ> Lighting and tile ticking are borked
[3:40] <rbos> the torches will be fixed :)
[3:40] <outsomnia> Everything besides gooolllddd is borked now.
[3:40] <outsomnia> >:|
[3:40] <Topple> yep
[3:40] <LuciferZ> Oh, Animator, have you been on Dys' server? It's on a VPS now.
[3:41] <outsomnia> So now infdev is (near) unplayable (to most) and for me, creative is ew.

[3:41] <LuciferZ> WHAT
[3:41] <LuciferZ> Sarcasm??
[3:41] <Yourself> holy crap, the new dwarf descriptions are epic
[3:41] <Topple> LuciferZ doesn
[3:41] <Topple> 't sarcasm

[3:44] <Malikat> my stream is superior.
[3:44] <ClassiestMedic> even without fullscreen
[3:45] <Drewseph> I have an idea how trees can work
[3:45] <LuciferZ> It would have been cool if like, Notch had put up solid color textures in indev, saying that the previous textures were 'too high rez'
[3:45] <Malikat> they can't work
[3:45] <ClassiestMedic> ugh
[3:45] <ClassiestMedic> IT WORKED
[3:45] <Tommerry11> damn, are you useing procaster?
[3:45] <Drewseph> so right now cutting them all down is annoying and hard
[3:45] <ClassiestMedic> it worked for one frame e_e
[3:45] <outsomnia> Drewseph, do you mean in physics terms or in general terms?
[3:45] <Malikat> i've been using procaster forever
[3:45] <Drewseph> how about if a block of wood is floating then it breaks, and if leaves have no wood connected to them they break too
[3:45] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) Quit (Quit: bye peoples.)

[3:46] <vurtual> I just came up with an awesome action movie plot.
[3:46] <Yourself> all the dwarf skills are different
[3:46] <outsomnia> How about my mountainous fortress is supported by a few flimsy pillars made of dirt?
[3:46] <LuciferZ> Because that would probably carry over to buildings that use logs
[3:46] <Yourself> i don't know which ones will make one dwarf end up as mayor
[3:46] <outsomnia> actually scratch that
[3:46] <vurtual> Guy with a semi-fancy armor suit thing, outfitted with various tools, and air tanks(and a filtery-gill thing and such), has to dive into the ocean to find a submarine that was hit by something
[3:46] <Drewseph> outsomnia, from a annoying to cut down perspective

[3:47] <Drewseph> I hate leaving floating branches
[3:47] <outsomnia> disregard that i'm a faggot.
[3:47] <LuciferZ> Vurtual: The first two hours are him swimming in deep ocean searching
[3:47] <vurtual> So basically a guy swimming deep into the ocean and fighting great whites with super-fast water jets, and things like a grappling hook
[3:47] <Drewseph> anyway what i mean is, a tree will take 30 seconds without an item to cut down
[3:47] <vurtual> and it's all amphibious and mostly maneuverable
[3:47] <LuciferZ> Last five minutes are him saying 'fuck this' and beating up sharks
[3:47] <outsomnia> also drew, the shapes of trees would be pretty odd if that was so
[3:47] <Drewseph> once a block is broken all the rest of the blocks will break
[3:48] <Drewseph> dropping woods galore
[3:48] <outsomnia> *drewseph

[3:48] <LuciferZ> And a mermaid pops up?
[3:48] <LuciferZ> Hell no.
[3:48] <vurtual> fine don't
[3:48] <outsomnia> either the branches would be overly abundant or there would just be a sparse amount of leaves
[3:49] <vurtual> Oh and the hero should be scared of deep ocean water maybe, but then again that's because I can't imagine an ocean without being incredibly terrified of sea beasts.
[3:49] <LuciferZ> What?
[3:49] <LuciferZ> The hero being the one who straps on this suit
[3:49] <vurtual> yes
[3:49] <LuciferZ> And dives into his greatest fear?
[3:49] <Drewseph> I love the leaves as they are
[3:49] <Drewseph> the branches need a new material
[3:49] <vurtual> batman was scared of bats you know
[3:49] <Drewseph> and I LOVE the new height
[3:50] <Drewseph> I hate not being able to have jumping room under a tree
[3:50] <vurtual> all the awesomest heroes are always fighting their greatest fear while still being awesome
[3:50] <LuciferZ> How does one end up in the Navy Seals or whatever clearly aquatic branch of the military it was that developed this suit
[3:50] <LuciferZ> If he has a great fear of the ocean:?
[3:50] <outsomnia> I say we should have shrubs, bushes, and hedges, though that's a completely mundane, inane, and completely unimportant idea.
[3:50] <vurtual> okay let me put it this way
[3:50] <vurtual> would you go swimming a thousand feet underwater
[3:50] <vurtual> entirely alone
[3:50] <outsomnia> though it'd be nice to have far down the line

[3:50] <LuciferZ> Hell no, Vurtual
[3:50] <vurtual> with only a glorified HEV suit for underwater
[3:51] <vurtual> that's what he's scared of
[3:51] * outsomnia unloads half his inventory full of arrows at iguana
[3:51] <LuciferZ> I expect the hero who probably volunteered to do this
[3:51] <vurtual> also fighting a shark by slamming into it at 200mph with a titanium spear
[3:51] <Iguana> Ohshit...
[3:51] <LuciferZ> To be at least slightly more comfortable
[3:51] <vurtual> and ripping its flesh out with a grappling hook
[3:51] <outsomnia> 200mph underwater
[3:51] * LG_LEgacy is now known as LG_Legacy

[3:52] <outsomnia> Oh I got it
[3:52] <Drewseph> what you got?
[3:52] <outsomnia> Is the protagonist Wally West?
[3:53] <vurtual> no some combination of Rico Rodriguez, Gordon Freeman, Tony Stark, Bruce Wayne, and Samus Aran
[3:53] <outsomnia> Okay
[3:53] <outsomnia> wat @ samus
[3:53] <Topple> Hey Lucifer
[3:54] <Topple> Got any ideas for building in MP Survival
[3:54] <Topple> or what not
[3:54] <outsomnia> Dams.
[3:54] <vurtual> outsomnia because the guy is working for like, the SEALs, but has this super-awesome armor nobody else wants to use
[3:54] <outsomnia> Though that's hard without buckets yet.
[3:54] <outsomnia> Ooh, is the super-awesome-secret armor made from alien technology?
[3:54] <Topple> Make Airlocks and stuff
[3:55] <vurtual> no it's just awesome
[3:55] <outsomnia> :|
[3:55] <outsomnia> So it's +5 kevlar?
[3:55] <vurtual> like the hev suit from half-life mixed in with maybe the iron man suit but way less super than the iron man suit
[3:56] <vurtual> not everyone is awesome enough to speed at 200mph underwater to fight sharks and whatever crazy sea beasts are down there.

[3:58] <vurtual> a sea beast would be a pretty awesome thing to fight, not done tooooooo much, but still...
[3:58] <vurtual> North Korea did it?
[4:00] <vurtual> So maybe they have some kinda submarine palace thing that nobody found because nobody cared, and have been trying to sink subs. Then when the hero gets on board, he fights soldiers hand-to-hand
[4:00] <outsomnia> George Bush in a similar suit with a crack team of special ops from some PMC.
[4:00] <vurtual> and like, uses the tiny grapply dart thing to grab a guy, pull him back, then use blades on the side of his arm to violently slice him open
[4:01] <outsomnia> Knowing Hollywood, some producer is likely to purchase this idea. .___.
[4:01] <vurtual> It would be awesome
[4:01] <ClassiestMedic> imma make a big stone tower
[4:01] <ClassiestMedic> above my huge mine
[4:01] <outsomnia> Also I gave biden a jetpack, just because I could.

[4:13] <LG_Legacy> You'll have the option to have it infinite or not

[4:13] <outsomnia> What I want to see next
[4:13] <outsomnia> Is the tutorial level :D

[4:53] <vurtual> how much nachobags is that
[4:54] <LuciferZ> It's mostly beef
[4:54] <LuciferZ> Then probably cheese.
[4:54] <LuciferZ> All I can say is that there are chips in there
[4:54] <Topple> Soooo

[4:57] <LuciferZ> Sounds super cool.
[4:57] <LuciferZ> Pretty much exactly what I was planning for, lol.
[4:57] <LuciferZ> I've got a headstart because I run a clan.
[4:58] <Topple> which one
[4:58] <LuciferZ> Royal Minecraft Militia.
[4:59] <vurtual> so guys, this one time
[4:59] <vurtual> I was sleeping in an RV(it was like a bedroom but better)
[4:59] <Topple> Lucifer, about what size of the clan?
[4:59] <vurtual> I woke up and nobody ever turned the fan on or opened a window in the morning, which resulted in extreeemely hot rv
[4:59] <vurtual> and EXTREEEEMEELY overheated me
[5:00] <vurtual> I was walking drunken-like, unable to look up, felt like collapsing.
[5:00] <LuciferZ> It's currently the biggest, somewhere around 20 active members, with a full roster of... 47 I believe. I'd have to go count again.
[5:00] * Classsiest|away (Kevjohnson@static-108-1-132-18.bstnma.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:00] <vurtual> So my first action was to turn the fan on I think, not sure if I did. Then, I went to the steps out, turned around, and decided I MUST GET A MOUNTAIN DEW FIRST

[5:00] * Classsiest|away is now known as Classiest|Infdev
[5:01] <vurtual> So I grabbed a mountain dew, closed the fridge, still almost unable to keep going, walked a bit to my front door, went in, almost went and collapsed on my bed BUT NO THE MOUNTAIN DEW MUST NOT BE WASTED

[5:01] <Classiest|Infdev> with every passing day, MP infdev draws closer and closer... :D
[5:01] <vurtual> Then I walked a bit further, put the mountain dew in my fridge, closed fridge, went back to my bed, and collapsed
[5:01] <vurtual> then presumably fell asleep, still burning hot
[5:01] <Classiest|Infdev> well that's pointless
[5:02] <LuciferZ> Yeah that was a totally retarded story, Vurtual.
[5:02] <Classiest|Infdev> x]
[5:02] <LuciferZ> I love you, but jesus.
[5:02] <Classiest|Infdev> hahaha
[5:02] <vurtual> I cooled down due to not being in dangerous levels of heat, woke up, and had my mountain dew. It was delicious.
[5:02] * PixelEater is back from: AFK (been away for 4h 10m)

[5:03] * Keiya (kyevan@rrcs-70-63-156-144.midsouth.biz.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[5:03] <vurtual> anyways that's what happens when a redneck nerd wakes up in extreme heat
[5:03] <LuciferZ> One time I woke up really hot, got a mountain dew, walked to my bedroom, put the dew away and fell asleep
[5:03] <LuciferZ> And then later I drank it
[5:03] <LuciferZ> The end.
[5:03] <Classiest|Infdev> I bet none of you can spell antidisestablishmentarianism :P
[5:03] <Classiest|Infdev> oh wait

[5:04] <vurtual> like, dying of extreme heat
[5:04] <Classiest|Infdev> Lol, I'd go take a cold shower
[5:04] <vurtual> your body is soaked maybe, but stopped sweating hours ago
[5:04] <LuciferZ> You're right, I didn't include that

[5:05] <LuciferZ> Then later I had a mountain dew

[5:05] <LuciferZ> The end
[5:05] <Classiest|Infdev> h, derp?
[5:05] <EmpiresBane> you're kidding me...
[5:05] <Classiest|Infdev> Java just died
[5:05] <Classiest|Infdev> dammit
[5:05] <EmpiresBane> i come in at the very end of the story?
[5:05] <Classiest|Infdev> I'm going to email Notch and ask when he esimates MP infdev will be out
[5:05] <LuciferZ> It was a summary of Vurtual's story
[5:05] <vurtual> Z so you know this one time this guy went and sniped people, they tried to fight back but didn't, he got shot but was okay and the war ended, the and.
[5:05] <LuciferZ> You didn't miss much.
[5:06] <outsomnia> 1) Crash Java, 2) Wake up in the middle of the ocean, 3) You're inventory is empty. wat
[5:06] <Classiest|Infdev> XD
[5:06] <vurtual> EmpiresBane, a few years ago I woke up in my RV(which, is very old, and I use it as a bedroom, with a fridge and microwave and stuff)
[5:06] <Classiest|Infdev> Imma make a big tower
[5:06] <LuciferZ> Vurtual, that sounds interesting. Describe that story in more detail please
[5:06] <vurtual> and it was sealed shut, boiling hot
[5:07] <EmpiresBane> and a giant moth attacked?
[5:07] <vurtual> so I almost went outside since not dying was nice, but decided to go grab a mountain dew from the fridge for later.
[5:07] <Classiest|Infdev> The fuck
[5:07] <Classiest|Infdev> I click to place a torch
[5:07] <Classiest|Infdev> and j ava dies epicly
[5:07] <vurtual> Also the whole time I couldn't even think about most of my senses, or look up.
[5:07] <LuciferZ> Yeah, don't do that Classiest
[5:07] <Classiest|Infdev> e_e
[5:07] <vurtual> Then I went outside, walked all the way to my house(well, it's next to it, but you have to walk a bit)
[5:08] <Classiest|Infdev> sigh
[5:08] <Classiest|Infdev> last time Notch was here:
[5:08] <Classiest|Infdev> Mon Apr 12 21:27:15 2010
[5:08] <EmpiresBane> you can't place torches in the new update?
[5:08] <LuciferZ> Nope.
[5:08] <Classiest|Infdev> yes you can
[5:08] <LuciferZ> Or shrubs.
[5:08] <EmpiresBane> damn
[5:08] <vurtual> Then, I got inside, almost collapsed with the mountain dew can, but went all the way back to the fridge that's in my house, put it in, and headed to a spot with a blanket. Then, I proceeded to collapse on the floor and fall asleep

[5:09] <EmpiresBane> i had a really bad headrush once

[5:10] <KodaichiZerq> hey boyos, whats happenin
[5:10] <EmpiresBane> in my lack of critical thinking while i had almost no blood in my brain, i thought it would be a good idea to support myself by sticking my hand in a sink filled with knives
[5:11] <Classiest|Infdev> nothing much
[5:11] <vurtual> no seriously guys you couldn't even comprehend the feeling it was crazy. I couldn't immediately process anything happening and my only stable memories are processed combinatinos of what happened
[5:11] <LuciferZ> Yeah, I'm not even going to fuck with infdev right now.
[5:11] <Classiest|Infdev> vurtual, I dun give a phuck
[5:11] <Classiest|Infdev> e-e
[5:11] <EmpiresBane> vurtual, i know exactly how you felt, it's not that special
[5:11] <vurtual> Classiest|Infdev then I will lock you in a room and heat it up to 110-120 degrees
[5:11] <EmpiresBane> it's a headruch
[5:11] <Aexis> And the tree generation code must be a mess.. forests look like treespam.
[5:11] <vurtual> no, it was not a headrush
[5:11] <Classiest|Infdev> xD
[5:11] <Aexis> Remember treespam? Ugh...
[5:11] <vurtual> heat your body up to 120 degrees while asleep
[5:11] <LuciferZ> I loved tree spam
[5:12] <EmpiresBane> well, close enough
[5:12] <LuciferZ> I did it to my own server
[5:12] <Aexis> Terrible two days for any good ops
[5:12] <LuciferZ> And freaked out my ops
[5:12] <Azathoth> i'll heat your body up to 120 degrees

[5:13] <EmpiresBane> wait... do the new trees generate on old maps?

[5:14] <EmpiresBane> minecraft is lagging terribly.
[5:14] <Pangogie> Yep yep
[5:14] <EmpiresBane> like 0.2fps
[5:14] <Pangogie> Broken code
[5:14] <KodaichiZerq> think about where we'd be right now if nawtch never decided to go infinite.
[5:14] <Classiest|Infdev> no
[5:14] <Classiest|Infdev> I have 30 fps
[5:14] <Classiest|Infdev> in infdev
[5:15] <Classiest|Infdev> :D
[5:15] <Pangogie> YOU IS FREAK

[5:15] <Classiest|Infdev> but yeah it sucks ass that torches are broke

[5:15] <Pangogie> Infdev is now lagtastic cus of teh update =[
[5:15] <Classiest|Infdev> imma quit infdev and move my ass on to MP creative

[5:20] <Aexis> Ok, enjoy metaphysics, I have to go.
[5:20] <ClassiestMedic> fucking epic
[5:20] <LuciferZ> And you ran a distance and then turned around
[5:20] <Aexis> Later, everyone.
[5:20] <LuciferZ> What would you see?

[5:21] <vurtual> do something to someone, who cannot see you due to extrmely slow light
[5:21] <vurtual> then, close their eyes forcably and hold them shut in a way that you can get away unseen
[5:21] <LuciferZ> I don't think so. I imagine running at the speed of light fucks up the way light reflects off of you
[5:21] <vurtual> like a blindfold with a rubik's cube lock
[5:21] <vurtual> Z, it'd push through you
[5:21] <Rooster> You'd probably be all black LuciferZ
[5:21] <vurtual> maybe you'd make a smear of your insides of light

[5:23] <LuciferZ> Yay, vurtual is wrong.
[5:23] <vurtual> it's BOTH OK
[5:24] <LuciferZ> NOT IN THIS CASE ITS NOT
[5:24] <vurtual> if some variable or function has to be lowercase intially only the second and later words will have a capital
[5:24] <EmpiresBane> but the reason isn't
[5:24] <vurtual> It iiis a convention though
[5:24] <LuciferZ> I need to watch that flash again.
[5:24] <EmpiresBane> but its not a reason
[5:24] <vurtual> IF YOU WANT TO ARGUE THIS FURTHER THEN I WILL FORCE YOU TO STUDY DOLPHIN-HUMAN MATING HABITS
[5:24] <vurtual> it drives you insaaane
[5:25] <LuciferZ> Probably not

[5:25] * Koko|fewds is now known as Kokopure
[5:26] <vurtual> EmpiresBane well if it's a female, you can get them to do it with you(if they're in the mood), by guiding them to shallow water
[5:26] <LuciferZ> smoothOperator, am I alone in really wanting to know what's in that fucking box?
[5:26] <vurtual> nobody's actually studied it enough to tell how willing they can be
[5:26] <EmpiresBane> i really have to pee...
[5:26] <smoothOperator> well then pee :|
[5:26] <vurtual> also male dolphins are like a weak shotgun when it comes to it(hurrr)
[5:26] <EmpiresBane> but i'm eating
[5:26] <EmpiresBane> sorry, i only do females
[5:27] <vurtual> Don't worry then, it's easy to do a female

[5:27] <LuciferZ> I fucked a shark once
[5:27] <vurtual> sharks are fish
[5:27] <EmpiresBane> did it have babies?
[5:27] <vurtual> dolphins are mammals, and apparently have nipples.
[5:27] <LuciferZ> Doesn't make it immune to a fucking
[5:27] <vurtual> it doesn't even have a proper hole, Z
[5:27] <LuciferZ> I didn't say it like it
[5:27] <EmpiresBane> do sharks have vaginas?
[5:28] <vurtual> no
[5:28] <vurtual> they just fart eggs I think
[5:28] <vurtual> then another shark fires a load all over them and boom
[5:28] <LuciferZ> I didn't even say it survived.
[5:28] <vurtual> also lions mate 20 times a day
[5:28] <Pangogie> O_o
[5:28] <EmpiresBane> but the babies grow in the sharks stomach
[5:28] <vurtual> and like all cats, have barbed wangs
[5:28] <EmpiresBane> barbed?
[5:29] <vurtual> yup
[5:29] <vurtual> all cat wangs are barbed
[5:30] <vurtual> dolphins also will try to mate with all sorts of things
[5:30] <EmpiresBane> like bone protrusions?
[5:30] <LuciferZ> Hur hur hur
[5:30] <LuciferZ> I got a bone protrusion for you
[5:30] * Codlike is now known as Codworking_andnot_Codzilla

[5:30] <LuciferZ> It had to be said
[5:31] <EmpiresBane> no
[5:31] <EmpiresBane> it did not
[5:31] <LuciferZ> And to seriously answer your question, no, not bone
[5:31] <vurtual> also dolphins sleep one half of their mind at a time
[5:31] <vurtual> in captivity they'll sleep entirely though
[5:31] <vurtual> and indian river dolphins(wait, what?) sleep for 4-60 seconds at a time

[5:32] <LuciferZ> I know, I already tested the lagginess, lol.
[5:33] <vurtual> the soviet navy trained dolphins to kill
[5:33] <LuciferZ> It's awesome, I had a huge blob and TNT everywhere, didn't skip a beat
[5:33] <vurtual> and they were sold to iran
[5:33] <Dysgalt> hmm
[5:34] <EmpiresBane> the allies have dolphins with sonar guns
[5:34] <vurtual> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Navy_Marine_Mammal_Program also dolphins serve in the military in supporting roles
[5:34] <Dysgalt> explains boost in bandwith
[5:34] <Dysgalt> vurtual
[5:34] <vurtual> wait, women also serve in supporting roles... hmmmm.
[5:34] <Dysgalt> did they use the dolphins
[5:34] <EmpiresBane> they combat the mind-controlled squids
[5:34] <Dysgalt> as sex spies?
[5:34] <LuciferZ> Guys I knifed a squid once
[5:34] <LuciferZ> In california
[5:35] <vurtual> so basically dolphins are trained to bump a device onto enemy divers to make them float up
[5:35] <Dysgalt> ok how does my server use 0mb of memory
[5:35] <vurtual> *poke* "Wait, what was that swimming behind me!?" *float float* "WHAT IS GOING ON"

[5:35] <vurtual> *surface* "...hey guise! :D"
[5:36] <Animator> Dysgalt, you skin looks different. Much nicer, actually.
[5:36] <EmpiresBane> it's using too much memory to calculate the memory usage?
[5:36] <Dysgalt> Thanks I recently made that one

[5:36] <Dysgalt> uh linux bugs
[5:36] <Dysgalt> it crashes every 5 minutes

[5:37] <Dysgalt> ylt will see if he can sort it out

[5:42] <vurtual> minecraft needs dolphins
[5:43] <vurtual> as a mostly friendly, intelligent mob that attacks inherently hostile mobs, jumps around, can think, and only becomes hostile if you actively attack them.

[6:01] <Brett> compress what can be compressed, etc
[6:01] <vurtual> Anything far away being turned into rough polygons

[6:20] <Brett> in to*
[6:20] <vurtual> okay here's a comprehensive minecraft guide:
[6:20] <LuciferZ> But my FPS was only crawling along anyways
[6:20] <vurtual> Creative is about digging for treasure hidden in the map
[6:20] <Cial> ya but mine went from bad to 1
[6:20] <LuciferZ> Vurtual
[6:20] <vurtual> and survival is about basejumping, so you have to get a high jump then hit space near the ground to parachute
[6:21] <LuciferZ> That encourages griefing and suicide.
[6:21] <LuciferZ> You should be ashamed.
[6:21] <vurtual> inorite
[6:21] <vurtual> nah just diggign underground
[6:21] <vurtual> most people will just walk around and move stuff
[6:21] <vurtual> and dig down
[6:21] <vurtual> then find caves and search
[6:21] * cosh (x@p5DCE9390.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #minecraft
[6:21] <vurtual> oh look gold
[6:21] <vurtual> I remember when ores were unplacable, and nobody had editors
[6:22] <Luingar> survival isn't actually about basejumping
[6:23] <Luingar> survival's about seeing how many monsters you can get to commit suicide
[6:23] <Luingar> see, they follow you around
[6:23] <Luingar> because your supposed to find a high spot, wait til they get close, then jump off
[6:23] <Luingar> they follow you off
[6:23] <Luingar> then, when you get about half-way down, you press space to activate yer chute
[6:23] <Luingar> and the monsters splat against teh grond
[6:24] <outsomnia> It's how you get score, you know.
[6:24] <Luingar> your score is multiplied by a combination of how much damage past their hp was dealt (overkill),+ how far they fell, * how many fell
[6:25] <Luingar> gotta be careful though, the chute doesn't activate unless you've hit terminal velocity (instakill speed)
[6:25] <Luingar> so if the fall is too short, you'll just hurt yerself
[6:26] <Luingar> i once got about 700 thousand points in one jump :D
[6:26] <Luingar> had a fkn army of zombies and spiders chasing me
[6:26] <Luingar> climbed stairs all the way to the very top of the map, and jumped into a pit i dug which went all the way to the bottom of it

[6:57] <Vis{ROTR2010}> >:D
[6:57] <vurtual> people were trying to(horribly) smooth talk me
[6:57] <vurtual> It was funny
[6:57] <Brett> i know
[6:58] <vurtual> I got harrassed
[6:58] <vurtual> after like two seconds
[6:58] <Brett> hey u single
[6:58] <Brett> hey u want a bf
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> The ONLY time that I played runescape
[6:58] <vurtual> infact you know what
[6:58] <vurtual> if I go back
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> someone threatened to kill me if I didn't take them to some mountain
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and they were obviously a high level
[6:58] <Brett> ...uh, yeah, sure, i'd LOVE to be your online boyfriend, just hand me the dowry now...
[6:58] <vurtual> because my friend noted that there was something new
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> so I listened
[6:58] <Brett> girlfriend*
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and walked around doing nothing
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> for four hours
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> D:
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> then I got eaten by a goblin thing
[6:58] <vurtual> act incredibly creepy
[6:58] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and never played again
[6:58] <vurtual> or speak only sindarin
[6:59] <Brett> runescape is slowly homogenizing
[6:59] <Brett> they have a basic instanced dungeon system in now
[6:59] <vurtual> or pretend to be playing another game
[6:59] <vurtual> yes, raiiids
[6:59] <Brett> it's only a matter of time before they get rid of item loss on death entirely
[6:59] <LuciferZ> I think Working Skydive is the oldest active server.
[6:59] <Brett> and then you're playing a shittier browser based wow with its character broken and creativity dead
[6:59] <vurtual> wow for kids
[7:00] <Brett> i remember when runescape was good... around the time legend's quest came out
[7:00] <Brett> everything since then has been varying shades of fucking terrible
[7:00] <vurtual> it went from bad
[7:00] <vurtual> to terrible
[7:00] <vurtual> to not entirely that terrible to what
[7:01] <Brett> it wasn't so bad
[7:01] <Cial> i quit RS about the time they put in word filters
[7:01] <vurtual> didn't they soften them a while back
[7:01] <Brett> at least there was some atmosphere... there was risk, the items didn't have an intrinsic monetary worth that far outweighs their practicality
[7:01] <Vis{ROTR2010}> vurtual, that's illegal
[7:01] <Vis{ROTR2010}> god ie
[7:01] <Vis{ROTR2010}> erm
[7:01] <Vis{ROTR2010}> go die
[7:02] <vurtual> it's illegal to have less filters?
[7:02] <vurtual> What?
[7:02] <vurtual> 2.1 million random coins for a random weapon with mildly higher stats from a random dumb location
[7:02] <ClassiestMedic> ?
[7:02] <vurtual> 500 quadrillion unneccessary coins
[7:02] <Brett> 2.1? try 20-something
[7:03] <ClassiestMedic> I'm mining in indev
[7:03] <Brett> the market has inflated absurdly
[7:03] <ClassiestMedic> I hit a coal vein :D
[7:03] <Brett> it's not hard to make money... just by all counts time consuming
[7:03] <Cial> i hated that there were all these little pointless things that you couldnt do unless you had a payed account
[7:03] <mail2345> Tu acabas deperder el partido
[7:03] <Brett> and the item you earn doesn't unlock even half as many hours of gameplay as you'd spend earning it
[7:03] <Brett> that's the mark of an imbalance
[7:03] <Cial> want to hop a fence? nope to bad
[7:03] <Brett> the effort is greater than the reward
[7:03] <vurtual> 5 dollars a month to open this door
[7:03] <Cial> use stepping stones ohh so sorry
[7:04] <vurtual> ONLY PREMIUM PEOPLE MAY CLIMB THIS RANDOM DAMAGED WALL
[7:04] <vurtual> THE REST OF YOU MUST SHUFFLE
[7:04] <Cial> want to use magic? sorry all your spell are shit unless you pay 15.95 $
[7:04] <Brett> but hey... i mean
[7:04] <vurtual> "Hey let's go open this random side door in this same area"
[7:04] <Brett> now, cool bro, you can run ONE dungeon
[7:04] <vurtual> "NO YOU MUST PAY MONEYS"
[7:04] <Vis{ROTR2010}> that's what your MOM said when I was FUCKING her last night!
[7:04] <Brett> for poor rewards
[7:04] <Vis{ROTR2010}> ohhhhhhh
[7:05] <Brett> to level up a ... skill
[7:05] <Brett> that doesn't apply outside of the dungeon
[7:05] <Vis{ROTR2010}> "NO YOU MUST PAY MONEYS"
[7:05] <Vis{ROTR2010}> hahahahhaa
[7:05] <Vis{ROTR2010}> pwnt
[7:05] <vurtual> "But.. it's the same door as the rest." "NO MEMBERS ONLY." "But-" "SHUT UP"
[7:05] <Brett> it's not that they're homogenizing
[7:05] * Vis{ROTR2010} is a dickface
[7:05] <Brett> it's that they're homogenizing poorly

[7:40] <rbos> compared to 40% english
[7:40] <Kokopure> oh so!
[7:40] <Kokopure> I learned something neato
[7:41] * mail2345 grabs his bot army
[7:41] * mail2345 commands it to kill Visiiri
[7:41] <Kokopure> I'm sure you'll all be like OH SO OBVS
[7:41] <Kokopure> but I didn't know it so
[7:41] <Kokopure> in infdev, if you load up a world that you've already saved to
[7:41] <Kokopure> all the trees will be the same as the old trees
[7:41] <Kokopure> but
[7:41] <Kokopure> when you walk far enough to load a new area
[7:42] <rbos> ayep
[7:42] <Kokopure> the trees will be like the new trees
[7:42] <Kokopure> mhm!
[7:42] <rbos> sometimes there's a really sharp boundary
[7:42] <rbos> it's neat
[7:42] <Kokopure> I learned this and now you know it too.
[7:42] <rbos> I'm really liking the new trees, it feels very forest-y
[7:42] <Kokopure> oh no kidding
[7:42] <Kokopure> the new trees are amazing
[7:43] <Kokopure> they really give you a sense of ground cover
[7:43] <rbos> little more variety of trunks, maybe a few different types of forest, like coniferous

[7:51] <mail2345> for information on the subject
[7:51] <Kokopure> pointless question
[7:51] <Kokopure> does anyone know, if the stars in minecraft are set in their ways, or are randomly generated?
[7:51] <Kokopure> if they're set in their ways I propose we make fan constellations.
[7:51] <Kokopure> :3
[7:52] <outsomnia|Clinton> Watch half of them be penises.
[7:52] <Kokopure> hrm.
[7:52] <Kokopure> what is the orbital system of planet Minecraft?
[7:52] <Kokopure> the stars and sun move in the same direction at the same speed.
[7:52] <outsomnia|Clinton> I propose we attempt to make them as pointlessly nonsensical as we can, such as a salad n' gravy constellation.
[7:53] <Kokopure> ......... I think planet minecraft may really be the center of its universe.
[7:53] <Kokopure> alternatively its solar system isn't moving at all and we're just rotating.

[8:43] <vede> ENNYWEIGH, I just got back from my first concert.
[8:43] <Serow> x.x I just tried the updated Minecraft. Got 2 FPS at the most. :[
[8:44] <Subculture> Wait
[8:44] <Subculture> Minecraft is updated?
[8:44] <Subculture> Hawt.
[8:44] <LuciferZ> Not especially hawt no.
[8:44] <LuciferZ> Trees are nice. Sand and gravel is nice.
[8:44] <Amiculi> it's most buggy
[8:44] <Subculture> Oh
[8:44] <Subculture> Wait
[8:44] <Subculture> It's a 'barely' update.
[8:45] <vurtual> "most buggy"
[8:45] <vurtual> Quite a phrase.
[8:45] <Subculture> It's like 'I added trees, enjoy' update
[8:45] <Amiculi> Yeah, just don't try to plant a tree
[8:45] <LuciferZ> But: Torches crash, shrubs crash, sand and gravel disappear in water, and almost everyone has reduced fps
[8:45] <Amiculi> they look neat though, I look forward to them being properly functional
[8:45] <vurtual> trees do grow
[8:45] <Amiculi> ah, I was wondering about the fps
[8:45] <vurtual> just don't plant them
[8:45] <Amiculi> I assume it's becuase of all the lighting going on with the shrubbery
[8:46] <vede> :o It was crazy awesome. My hand was shut in a car door, some insane/hot chick punched me in the face, there was weed all over the place, and my friend and I were basically tripping on dropped beer bottles on the way out.
[8:46] <EmpiresBane> wow.... that was a calm concert

[9:00] <vurtual> and then drift down

[9:00] <KodaichiZero> huh.
[9:00] <KodaichiZero> Well
[9:00] <vurtual> So you need special tires and wheels and a relevant frame to handle low gravity.

[9:02] <vurtual> additionally the ability to add glowsticks so when you ride fast it makes a lightcycle-like beam of light behind you.
[9:02] <vurtual> because of the tire shape
[9:10] <Serow> Just about everything crashes the new infdev, apparently. XD
[9:11] <rbos> torches and saplings and what else?
[9:11] <Serow> Back to /indev/ for me, I guess.
[9:14] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) has joined #minecraft

[9:14] <vede> Prolly a bunch of pussies shouting about how it's so unbalanced.
[9:15] <vurtual> it'd change the game entirely
[9:15] <vede> But that'd be the answer to most "What if they added <thing> to <generally competitive game>" questions.
[9:15] <vurtual> although there's the option of making it weak and lame but that'd be lame too
[9:16] <vede> What if they added speed boots to TF2? "OMFG SO UNBALANCED IT SUX SO BAAAAAAAAAAADA"
[9:16] <rbos> does anyone know if noth is planning to implement guilds/clans/groups of some kind in minecraft?
[9:16] <vurtual> There's always things like "jetpack powerup to quake" that'd probably not get too much of a negative reaction
[9:16] <vede> rbos, I don't think Notch wants to make stuff like that controlled by the game.
[9:17] <vede> I think he's going for a *very* player-run type system.
[9:17] <rbos> hm, that's too bad, it'd be a natural extension to claim flags.
[9:17] <vurtual> I don't want nothing like claim flags
[9:17] <vurtual> just things like lots of options for fortification
[9:17] <vede> Yeah, claim flags are never happening. They'll just be flag doo-hickeys that stop monsters from spawning around them.
[9:18] <N3X15> Okay. Tip: Never, everm ever hit F11 in infdev.
[9:18] <rbos> what about when you're afk?
[9:18] <rbos> what sort of things can you do to defend a base?
[9:18] * Redshift (chatzilla@c-24-20-129-39.hsd1.or.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.3/20100401080539])
[9:18] <vurtual> maybe crafting logs into fortwalls that take ages to dig
[9:18] <vurtual> and burn slowly
[9:18] <rbos> that doesn't help much if you're gone for 8 hours
[9:18] <vurtual> so when your walled-in town is on fire, everybody panics
[9:18] <vede> rbos, then that sucks for you, I guess.
[9:18] <rbos> :/ I have a job
[9:18] <vede> Take the crap back over.
[9:18] <vurtual> rbos survival is supposed to be a cooperative "win the game" thing
[9:18] <rbos> that would make minecraft pretty unplayable
[9:18] <vurtual> pvp would just be greedy or funny
[9:19] <vede> The game isn't about beating other people, rbos.
[9:19] <vurtual> although you could always do that
[9:19] <vede> It's just about doing crap and having fun.
[9:19] <vurtual> strip someone of their equipment, lock them up in a dungeon then smack them slowly while interrogating them
[9:19] <rbos> I don't really want to beat other people, but I do kinda want to have my stuff still intact after, y'know, sleeping. :/
[9:19] <vurtual> no wait, give them all their safe, valuable equipment, and use that to taunt tem
[9:19] <FNugget> inf dev just died while placing a torch
[9:19] <vurtual> rbos, you won't even paly long enough to sleep
[9:19] <vede> rbos, hide your stuff.
[9:19] <vurtual> nugget, we know
[9:19] <FNugget> k
[9:20] <vurtual> CAN'T YOU PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION GAHGHGHAGHGHGHGHGHGHHHHHHHHHHH
[9:20] <rbos> Hiding doesn't sound terribly practical
[9:20] <vede> Make a secret chamber that no one but you would ever find.
[9:20] * vurtual goes on a rampage and knocks over buildings
[9:20] <vurtual> rbos, find a hill
[9:20] <vurtual> stuff all your stuff inside a house in the hill
[9:20] <rbos> besides, what if I want to show off my stuff?
[9:20] <vurtual> cover the hill so nobody can find it
[9:20] <rbos> wha'ts the point of building stuff if it's hidden?
[9:20] <vurtual> take it back out when you want to show stuff
[9:20] <vede> rbos, we mean hide all your items and crap.
[9:20] <FNugget> hide your stuff in lava
[9:20] <rbos> well yeah, that's a good idea, but what about my fortress
[9:21] <vede> And, why would someone DESTROY a castle when they can just as easily take it over and use all the crap inside.
[9:21] <FNugget> hide your castle in lava
[9:21] <vurtual> hide your lava in a castle inside lava
[9:21] <vurtual> they'll nver find it there
[9:21] <Subculture> I'm as free as a bard.
[9:21] <vede> rbos, I really think you're misunderstanding the whole idea of this game.
[9:21] <rbos> griefers are assholes, they'll spend time just to ruin your day, they don't really care about taking over
[9:21] <rbos> just wrecking
[9:21] <vurtual> rbos
[9:21] <vurtual> the game won't last long enough
[9:21] <vurtual> It's not lke playing for weeks, it's not an mmo
[9:21] <vurtual> you gather supplies, raid stuff, then win
[9:21] <rbos> I think you and I have a different idea of what we want out of it :/
[9:21] <vurtual> I'm telling you what notch said
[9:22] <rbos> I really like the creative aspect with gameplay attached, thinking long-term
[9:22] <vurtual> as in, that's his plan
[9:22] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) Quit (Quit: bye peoples.)
[9:22] <vede> rbos, griefers will always exist.
[9:22] <vede> ALWAYS.
[9:22] <rbos> ah, I haven't seen that, do you have a reference?
[9:22] <rbos> you don't have to make it easy to grief
[9:22] <vede> rbos, making it hard to grief also means making it harder to have fun.
[9:22] * iKJames (ikjames@cblmdm72-241-129-156.buckeyecom.net) has left #minecraft
[9:23] <vede> If you want your stuff to be indestructible by anyone but you, then Minecraft isn't for you.
[9:23] <rbos> I don't really want to play hour-long minecraft games, I want to build towns, set up trade deals, get a community going, make friends
[9:23] <bildramer> oh hey
[9:23] <rbos> if that's not where minecraft is going, it's probably not for me, I guess :/
[9:24] <vede> That's nowhere near where Minecraft is going.
[9:24] <vede> Every little bit of the entire world can be changed by anyone else. That's the point. No restrictions, no static world.
[9:24] <vurtual> I still remember a submarine I made that after a while, nobody found
[9:24] <Konogan> ^
[9:24] <Subculture> I'm so sick of 'griefer' bitching.
[9:24] <Subculture> It's fucking survival. You're going to have people attacking you.
[9:24] <FNugget> rbos: you can get that going by having a private server with friends
[9:25] <Subculture> That's the whole god damn point to building a fortress.
[9:25] <Konogan> Yup
[9:25] <vede> Subculture, he's talking about when he's not there to defend it.
[9:25] <Subculture> And no one's going to go around trying to kill each other as much as you think.
[9:25] <vurtual> start up a whole castle's-wroth
[9:25] <vurtual> with guard shifts
[9:25] <vurtual> and moats of fire
[9:25] <vurtual> filled with fire-ichthyosaurs
[9:25] <rbos> So I build a nice hidden underground fortress, and someone digs into it and wrecks a day's work while I'm asleep
[9:25] <Ziwhtam> Velociraptors
[9:25] <Subculture> If they die, they lose their stuff. So why would they risk losing their precious diamond sword if I manage to crack them upside the head when they're going after a buddy of mine. A griefer becomes griefed. Boom, just like that.
[9:26] <vurtual> beak dogs
[9:26] <rbos> do I just QQ and start over?
[9:26] <vurtual> yes rbos
[9:26] <vurtual> it's like real life
[9:26] <Ziwhtam> No you T_T and start over
[9:26] <Ziwhtam> or >:D
[9:26] <vurtual> if they loot your stuff(which the greedy kids will)
[9:26] <vede> rbos, what do you really think the odds are of someone randomly digging down into your underground fortress in a world as big as Minecraft's will be?
[9:26] <vurtual> loot it back
[9:27] <Subculture> Minecraft MP will be a lonely place for a while.
[9:27] <Subculture> You'll have your very own plot of land to yourself for a long time before someone comes up to say hi, methinks, if Notch is going the whole MMO route.
[9:27] * Lord_Aidan (chatzilla@63-226-219-24.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:27] <Lord_Aidan> ok
[9:27] <Lord_Aidan> Time to ping AndrewPH
[9:27] <rbos> I assumed that all new players would spawn in the same area, and you'd end up building out from that centre.
[9:27] <Lord_Aidan> Supposedly done by saying his name..
[9:27] <Subculture> Being that we'll probably be spread out, when someone finally comes up to say hi, they'll be glad they found someone to talk to.
[9:27] <Lord_Aidan> AndrewPH
[9:27] <Lord_Aidan> AndrewPH
[9:27] <Lord_Aidan> AndrewPH
[9:28] <Lord_Aidan> Not sure how it works
[9:28] <vede> I really think that any sort of "Sorry, you're not this person, you can't do anything here. Go away." would ruin Minecraft.
[9:28] <Lord_Aidan> AndrewPH
[9:28] <Subculture> That is only a guess though, and I'm trying to predict what Minecraft MP will be like.
[9:28] <Lord_Aidan> You mean..
[9:28] <Subculture> I agree Vede.
[9:28] <vede> Also, way to make yourself look like a massive dumbass, Lord_Aidan.
[9:28] <Lord_Aidan> Whats there?
[9:28] <Lord_Aidan> Lol
[9:28] <Subculture> I wouldn't say he looks like a massive dumbass.
[9:28] <Subculture> Just a little mislead.
[9:28] <Lord_Aidan> Andrew lied to me =O
[9:28] <vede> Because saying the same damn thing over and over again is stupid.
[9:28] <Lord_Aidan> Anyways, trying to find him
[9:28] <Lord_Aidan> He's hosting my server
[9:29] <Lord_Aidan> which is being bot attacked.
[9:29] <rbos> I've been reading the minecraft forum and there's a few posts that say Notch is planning to implement claim flags of some kind. Which would at the very least prevent mobs from spawning. Anything else on that?
[9:29] <vede> And if there were any ops here you probably would have been kicked.
[9:29] <vede> rbos, that's a result of the forums being filled with ignorant fools.
[9:29] <Lord_Aidan> Look, all I know what is what I was told
[9:29] <Lord_Aidan> you dont have to start being a jerk about it
[9:29] <vede> Notch said he'll have things that stop monsters from spawning.
[9:29] <Lord_Aidan> Jeez.
[9:29] <rbos> well, your "notch says X" doesn't seem any more valid than their "notch says Y".
[9:29] <Subculture> Uhm.
[9:29] <Subculture> Vede.
[9:29] <rbos> is there a connection?
[9:29] <Subculture> Light stops mobs from spawning.
[9:29] <Subculture> Wait a minute.
[9:30] <vede> rbos, well, I was here when it happened...
[9:30] <Subculture> Vede, do you even have the game?
[9:30] <vede> Uh, yeah... O_o
[9:30] <Subculture> Okay good.
[9:30] <Subculture> I was starting to worry.
[9:30] <vede> Subculture, I mean stuff that doesn't even matter with light.
[9:30] <Subculture> 'THIS JUST IN: NOTCH TO IMPLEMENT FOOD'
[9:30] <Subculture> WOW!
[9:30] <vurtual> NOTCH SAYS MINECRAFT WILL BECOME A WOW-STYLED GAME WITH QUICKTIME-EVENT-BASED COMBAT AND LEVELLING TO INCREASE YOUR ABILITY TO CONTROL LAND
[9:30] <rbos> Well, I'm content to wait to see if the game turns into something I want to play. :)
[9:30] <rbos> if it's fun, I stay, if it's not, I go, no problem either way.
[9:30] <Konogan> XD
[9:31] <rbos> I have no stake.
[9:31] <Lord_Aidan> Yeah well
[9:31] <Lord_Aidan> Notch told me Zombie Siege
[9:31] <vurtual> Except we all know about you now rbos.
[9:31] <Lord_Aidan> was coming out in mid Jan.
[9:31] <vurtual> You will never be forgotten.
[9:31] <rbos> hahah
[9:31] <vurtual> The internet does not forgive or forget.
[9:31] <rbos> I am memorable
[9:31] <Subculture> NOTCH SAYS MINECRAFT WILL INCLUDE 64 PLAYER COMBAT COMPLETE WITH RANKING SYSTEMS, PLAYER CLASSES, AIRCRAFT, AND SQUAD BASED SPAWNING
[9:31] <Lord_Aidan> So take what he says with a grain of salt =\
[9:31] <Lord_Aidan> Ooh Aircraft
[9:31] <Lord_Aidan> Me wants.
[9:31] <outsomnia|Clinton> Oh yeah well, I quote directly from what Notch told me:
[9:31] <vurtual> what aircraft
[9:31] <Amiculi> ...
[9:31] <outsomnia|Clinton> "Notch: hi"
[9:31] <Subculture> Aircraft would be cool actually.
[9:31] * Amiculi turns on a fan and points it at the window.
[9:32] <Subculture> But
[9:32] <Subculture> Something that makes sense.
[9:32] <Subculture> Like
[9:32] <Subculture> A hot air balloon.
[9:32] <Konogan> Yeah
[9:32] <outsomnia|Clinton> arrows
[9:32] <Subculture> Something slow, that floats pleasantly in the air.
[9:32] <vede> rbos, if you're looking to see if Minecraft will ever have any special building restrictions, then you're in the wrong place, definitely.
[9:32] <Subculture> YOU CANNOT FLY AN ARROW
[9:32] <Lord_Aidan> orlynao?
[9:32] <rbos> I like the idea where you mine blocks from floating islands and make stuff out of it.
[9:32] <Lord_Aidan> Maybe if you fired
[9:32] <Lord_Aidan> tand jumped on it...
[9:32] <vurtual> we need really cool fighter jets
[9:32] <outsomnia|Clinton> I can sure as hell shoot down you're balloon :D
[9:32] <vurtual> SR-71 that flies so high you can only make out the rough foggy details in the sky

[9:33] <vurtual> are fear!

[9:37] <outsomnia|Clinton> There's a hiliariously lengthy (okay it's not really that long actually) list of things that are bad to do in here.
[9:37] <outsomnia|Clinton> Most of the time, everyone ignores it.
[9:37] <NoBalls> I am back
[9:37] <vurtual> Sometimes I wonder if my dirty topics are bad.
[9:37] <outsomnia|Clinton> What dirty topics?
[9:37] <vurtual> Then again warez is shared and discussed constantly here so I generally dismiss that.
[9:37] <NoBalls> Eheheh
[9:37] <Konogan> ******?

[9:38] <outsomnia|Clinton> That has near nothing to do with dirt at all.
[9:38] <vurtual> maybe random moments about pokemon porn, mermaid fantasies, and so on.
[9:38] <NoBalls> Lol
[9:38] <vurtual> mudfighting in water-dissolving heavy clothes
[9:38] <vurtual> enough dirt?
[9:38] <NoBalls> Hello Vutual
[9:39] <vurtual> I wonder if you like did that
[9:39] <outsomnia|Clinton> Wait, the clothes can dissolve water?
[9:39] <vurtual> but they started out in hazmat suits with layers and layers of clothing
[9:39] <NoBalls> Some can
[9:39] <outsomnia|Clinton> wadafak.
[9:39] <vurtual> so the inside dissolves from sweat, and the outside wears down into layers that rip off
[9:39] <vurtual> they make dissolving bikinis outsomnia|Clinton
[9:39] <Subculture> I'm wearing a hazmat suit right now actually.
[9:39] <NoBalls> Nice
[9:39] <Subculture> I forgot to take it off.
[9:39] <Konogan> I want 4.
[9:39] <vurtual> Subculture are you wearing anything under it?
[9:39] <Subculture> It's like a second skin, I don't even notice it anymore.
[9:39] <outsomnia|Clinton> - A- lern2 proper hyphen placement
[9:39] <outsomnia|Clinton> sheesh.
[9:39] <Subculture> Nope.
[9:40] <Subculture> I'm kidding.
[9:40] <Subculture> I'm wearing clothes you mook.
[9:40] <vurtual> k
[9:40] <vurtual> being naked in a hazmat suit is interesting
[9:40] <Subculture> It's sticky.
[9:40] <vurtual> Depending on what it is it can be like, being completely naked
[9:40] <vurtual> but nobody can see you
[9:40] <Subculture> Your balls stick to everything.
[9:40] <vurtual> and you're just, naked
[9:40] <Subculture> It depends on the hazmat suit.
[9:40] <vurtual> walking around naked, nobody can see your naked
[9:41] <Konogan> You're not.
[9:41] <Konogan> You're wearing something.
[9:41] <Subculture> If you're wearing the full 2RKV1 people can see your shoulders.
[9:41] <Subculture> So
[9:41] <Subculture> People would know you were naked.
[9:41] <Konogan> It's like saying. "Hey look, I'm naked in my clothes!".

[10:18] <Splatticus> Oh, shrubs crash?
[10:19] <rbos> hm.. I really like the idea of land claim flags making blocks invulnerable to everything except siege weapons. That gives you a motivation to build forts, and a motivation to build things to bust into them in order to steal the flag.

[11:40] <vurtual> so basically I want to play a game where you fly space planes around and you can climb around and jump out onto other planes and beat up the turrets with torches
[11:41] <vurtual> so there'd be some plane with turrets all over it and a tinier one floats over to it and a guy jumps out of a hatch and climbs around with magnets, then welds guns to the hull.
[11:41] <vurtual> but nobody notices him so he like, uses a little weapon to blow precision holes in partially essential systems whenever the ship is under fire, so people think they're taking serious damage.
[11:42] <vurtual> Then he can safely jump away after breaking half the control surfaces and fancy systems and guns.
[11:47] <LG_Legacy> Sounds like Just Cause 2

[12:26] <Splatticus> Imho, inbetween updates, I honestly don't play because there's nothing new. And it's kind of gay, because he already has my money and I'm not getting my play time.
[12:26] <Subculture> Splatticus.
[12:26] <Subculture> Please don't bitch about Notch.
[12:27] <Splatticus> I was all 'ZOMG SAND? I HAVE A REASON TO PLAY." And "Oh hi, torches are borked." Kind of kicks me in the nads.
[12:27] <Subculture> Of all the game developers, I've never met a more honest, friendly and ATTENTIVE game developer.
[12:27] <Splatticus> Not bitching about Notch, god no. U:
[12:27] <Splatticus> I'm just voicing my distress about space between updates.
[12:27] <Subculture> Seriously, he LISTENS to his fan base.
[12:27] <Splatticus> I agree entirely.
[12:27] <Subculture> If you've got a question, he stops and listens to you

[12:31] <Superwafflez> make flint
[12:31] <Subculture> Seriously.
[12:31] <Splatticus> Fire should generate light.
[12:31] <Superwafflez> it does
[12:31] <Subculture> What's so great about Infdev anyways?
[12:31] <Subculture> Fire does generate light.
[12:31] <Splatticus> That way you can set the tre--..
[12:32] <Subculture> I mean, yes it is infinite, but...
[12:32] <Subculture> I like the idea of being able to CONQUER and island.
[12:32] <Superwafflez> infinite is mainly for multiplayer
[12:32] <Superwafflez> and not funning out
[12:32] <Superwafflez> of anything
[12:32] <Superwafflez> running*(
[12:32] <Yohanu> ha! got da best idea evar for that 40x30 game contest
[12:32] <TrueWolves> There will be islands to conquer in inf maps.
[12:33] <Yohanu> a procedural adventure game generator
[12:33] <TrueWolves> but then you need to war against other's
[12:33] <Yohanu> that generates the gfx as well
[12:33] <Yohanu> :D
[12:33] <Subculture> Like, you've completely terraformed it.
[12:33] <Subculture> No
[12:33] <Subculture> I think funning works.
[12:33] <Subculture> 'And not funning out'
[12:33] <Subculture> Like running out of fun :P
[12:33] <Subculture> 40x30?
[12:33] <Yohanu> 40x30 pixels
[12:33] <Yohanu> ega graphics
[12:33] <Subculture> So did Notch confirm that multiplayer will be on one gigantic server?
[12:33] <TrueWolves> no
[12:33] <Subculture> Oh
[12:33] <Subculture> So how does multiplayer infdev work?
[12:34] <Subculture> Do you just load an infdev map
[12:34] <Subculture> And then... you just spread out?
[12:34] <Superwafflez> yeah
[12:34] <Subculture> Sounds fishy.
[12:34] <Superwafflez> infinite maps is good though, towns will be built
[12:34] <Subculture> that would be a processing nightmare.
[12:34] <Superwafflez> roads between them
[12:34] <Superwafflez> <3
[12:34] <Subculture> What if some dick decided to run forever in one direction.
[12:34] <Subculture> He'd make the map ginormous.
[12:34] <Superwafflez> not really
[12:34] <Superwafflez> just the chunks he activates
[12:35] <Subculture> I would hate to get lost in infdev :(
[12:35] <Superwafflez> that's why we need flags!
[12:35] <Splatticus> I'd say that eventually there'd have to be an option to limit the size of the map on the server. Like with my comp, I'd probably set it like, 50gb. :l
[12:35] <Subculture> What do flags accomplish again?
[12:35] <Splatticus> Respawn points.
[12:35] <Subculture> Ah right.
[12:35] <Superwafflez> or just general markers
[12:36] <Subculture> Ooo
[12:36] <Subculture> o
[12:36] <Subculture> Having your own customized flag would be cool
[12:36] <Splatticus> On the land ownership flag thing... I think it'd be interesting to make them like, CTF. Say you're green, and you've built a base. And blue comes in, and gets all up in your greenflags shit. It turns into a blue flag. U: And then if you die, you get spawned elsewhere, with a new green flag in your inv to start over.
[12:37] <Superwafflez> yeah that's the idea for CTF I think
[12:37] <Splatticus> Would lead to alot of attacking and conquering. Maybe limit servers to a certain number of colors, so that people joining get split forcefully into teams.
[12:37] <Splatticus> Rather than allowing them to pick teams.

[12:41] <Splatticus> Subculture, it's more of the Wow factor of Infdev that makes it so... interesting.
[12:41] <Superwafflez> And sell-able =D
[12:41] <Splatticus> It's the randomized generation of maps.
[12:41] <Superwafflez> Procedural generation <3
[12:42] <Splatticus> I've had perfectly 16x16 towers in the middle of the ocean that I've cored out and built up. I mean... That
[12:42] <Splatticus> 's just awesome. :[
[12:42] <Splatticus> Anyway.
[12:42] <Splatticus> I think I'm going to go to bed.
[12:42] <Superwafflez> old maps are incompatible
[12:43] <Superwafflez> sucks
[12:43] <Superwafflez> no sand or gravel for them

[13:45] <Seepia> dont think I actually know what procedural programming is
[13:45] <Yohanu> a
[13:45] <Seepia> i must be waaay behind :p
[13:45] <Yohanu> Seepia basically i'm making a random adventure game generator
[13:45] <Yohanu> that generates graphics as well
[13:45] <Yohanu> :P
[13:45] <Seepia> \o
[13:45] <Yohanu> and i'm making it in the 30x40 pixel ega format
[13:46] <Oth_> That sounds pretty cool.
[13:46] <Yohanu> it is mad fun to work with
[13:48] <Oth_> Is that for that competition notch posted about?
[13:48] <Yohanu> probably :P
[13:48] <Yohanu> his blog entry gave me inspirationz to write something like that anyways
[13:48] <Oth_> Cool
[13:48] <Yohanu> so i guess it'll end up in the competition

[13:50] <Oth_> XD it's a great way to learn though.
[13:51] <Yohanu> well, i'm not really learning anything from this as such
[13:51] <Yohanu> but it's an interesting experiment
[13:51] <Yohanu> i already know how to construct everything
[13:51] <Yohanu> :P
[13:51] <Yohanu> recursive map standard <3
[13:51] <Yohanu> i can pretty much make it generate an infinite map system
[13:51] <Yohanu> lol
[13:54] <Oth_> But can it do 8x the size of the planet? :D
[13:55] <Oth_> What kind of game is it anyway?
[13:56] <Oth_> What is it about?
[13:56] <Yohanu> like i said, adventure game :P
[13:56] <Yohanu> it's going to be completely procedural
[13:56] <Yohanu> so the plot will be generated on the fly when you run it
[13:56] <Superwafflez> complicated
[13:56] <Yohanu> a new adventure every time!
[13:56] <Yohanu> not really Superwafflez
[13:56] <Superwafflez> will the ending be on a timer or have prerequisites?
[13:56] <Yohanu> i'll just have it select from a dictionary of keywords
[13:57] <Oth_> Cant really imagine how that would work, but it sounds really awesome!

[13:57] * ylt (ylt@92.19.132.74) has joined #minecraft
[13:57] <Superwafflez> well the game has to end somehow
[13:57] <Superwafflez> lol
[13:57] <Yohanu> goal will most likely be to escape the "dungeon"
[13:57] <Yohanu> and to do that the game will generate locked doors, various object containers etc
[13:57] <Yohanu> randomized puzzles
[13:57] <Yohanu> lol
[13:58] <Yohanu> it's just a prototype though
[13:58] <Yohanu> since it will be open source i'm sure others will have fun with it

[14:00] <Yohanu> probably
[14:00] <Yohanu> Superwafflez, http://i42.tinypic.com/21evvph.png
[14:00] <Yohanu> that's the hot graphics i use now!
[14:00] <Yohanu> generated on the fly
[14:00] <Superwafflez> hehe
[14:00] <Oth_> I think he means that it should show the adventure visually or in 3D, not text based
[14:01] <Oth_> So you say, make a door of a certain size, shape and color, and it generates it?

[15:21] <chibifs> We're ignoring you for a reason.
[15:21] <Luingar> aye? and what would that be?
[15:22] <WoM_Guest> So friendly.
[15:23] <chibifs> Channel rules.
[15:23] <Luingar> channel rules specifically say client HACKS
[15:23] <Luingar> game clients aren't forbidden, only things that modify the game
[15:23] <Luingar> which is not what i want.
[15:23] <PixelEater> well you arent supposed to be asking for it either way
[15:23] <PixelEater> kthxbai.
[15:24] <Luingar> how do ya figure?
[15:24] <Luingar> *facepalm
[15:24] <chibifs> Notch doesn't want it.
[15:24] <PixelEater> notch specifically said to not distribute the in[f]dev game client
[15:24] <Luingar> ah.
[15:24] <PixelEater> so we will follow his wishes.
[15:25] <Luingar> never heard that.
[15:25] <Luingar> alrighty

[15:26] <Luingar> thanks
[15:26] <Luingar> @_@
[15:26] <chibifs> :)
[15:26] <Luingar> anyways
[15:26] <ZomBuster> you can press F11 to get fullscreen
[15:27] <Luingar> still not procaster friendly, which was 2
[15:27] <Luingar> aspect ration is wrong
[15:27] <DimJim> don't feel bad about having no talents
[15:27] <DimJim> some people are just better than you, son
[15:27] <ZomBuster> hm true
[15:27] <Luingar> by which i mean my moniter's aspect ratio is wrong
[15:28] <ZomBuster> but you don't need a high resolution for streaming it
[15:28] <Luingar> no,
[15:28] <Yohanu> sup chibifs
[15:28] <Luingar> infact a high resolution kills the FPS
[15:28] <chibifs> Not much.
[15:28] <chibifs> Linguar: There is a script on userscripts.org for adjusting the app resolution.
[15:29] <Luingar> um.
[15:29] <Yohanu> mk
[15:29] <Luingar> thanks
[15:30] <Luingar> gah
[15:30] <Luingar> i don't need it bigger, i need it with a different aspect ration
[15:30] <Luingar> *ratio
[15:31] <Luingar> i keep typing ration >.<

[17:40] <Marach> minor? lo
[17:40] <Marach> l
[17:40] <Drewseph_> but I still don't understand why multiplayer is so kick ass
[17:41] <Kokopure> Drewseph_, it's because finally you'll be able to have a friend who can kill creepers that try to sneak up on you from behind
[17:41] <Drewseph_> its just gonna resort to more griefers
[17:41] <eritz> all the good minecraft servers are going to be password-protected anyway
[17:41] <Kokopure> plus a lot of griefers are free users.
[17:41] <eritz> people are going to find ways to deal with griefers, don't even concern yourself with it
[17:41] <Drewseph_> how does one join a good server then?
[17:42] <Drewseph_> and all the hacks/flying?

[17:42] <Drewseph_> I really want all the limitations of single player
[17:42] <Kokopure> as for flying Notch says he's getting rid of that unless moderators specifically allow them.

[17:43] <Drewseph_> yeah
[17:43] <Drewseph_> no health
[17:43] <Drewseph_> just infinite blocks to place
[17:43] <Drewseph_> and all blocks take 1 click to break
[17:43] <Kokopure> oh
[17:44] <Kokopure> you're talking about creative!
[17:44] <Kokopure> that's why Notch is making multiplayer Survival!

[20:22] <blaster> How did I cause a flamewar?
[20:22] <Quatroking> oh boo hoo the dellfag ignored me
[20:22] <Jat> i hate hoe when firefox says i need a new plugin, the only option it gives me is basically DOWNLOAD PLUGIN and it wont even tell me what plugin it is actually going to try to install ahead of time
[20:22] <Quatroking> ...
[20:22] <blaster> Anyway Marach have you played it?
[20:22] <Jat> unless thats changed in the past year or two
[20:22] <Quatroking> you know you can click on it
[20:22] <Quatroking> and it tells you which plugin it is
[20:22] <vede> blaster, by using a shitty program to make a shitty game and linking to its shitty site. WAI2GO
[20:23] <Marach> lets see
[20:23] <Adura> Fuck plugins.
[20:23] <blaster> http://www.yoyogames.com/games/97193-the-city-creator
[20:23] <blaster> Its... Okish
[20:23] <Quatroking> and if you're like "ha, fuck reliable comptuer performance, install this lovely spyware!" you can click on install
[20:23] <Marach> the plugin doesnt work for me
[20:23] <Jat> i see
[20:23] <blaster> :<
[20:23] <Marach> i press play now, nothing happens
[20:23] <blaster> Er
[20:23] <blaster> You can download the EXE
[20:23] <Marach> it takes TIME.
[20:23] <blaster> Time takes a dimention
[20:23] <Marach> during TIME, i can as well learn java.
[20:23] <Marach> also, it doesn't
[20:24] <Jat> i thought i tried that plugin thing in firefox once or something and instead of telling me what i needed it told me to click on search for plugins or something
[20:24] <Jat> so i did and it started installing it without asking me
[20:24] <blaster> OH FUCK it started to rain positronium
[20:24] <Jat> i think it was java or flash though so it was ok
[20:24] <Quatroking> blaster it doesn't fucking work
[20:24] <vede> blaster, I could download the exe. But not everyone uses Windows. :OOOOOO
[20:24] <Jat> but it wouldnt even tell me ahead of time what it was
[20:24] <Quatroking> I installed it, hit play now and its not working
[20:24] <blaster> :<

[21:06] <blaster> The more you look at notch's eyes, the more it looks like he has a evil plan
[21:06] <Koko|Klass> it doesn't stack normally.
[21:06] <Azathoth> i explained the furnace trick already, koko
[21:06] <Koko|Klass> it'll only stack when it's being cooked by the furnace

[21:10] <blaster> And a bottle of ram
[21:11] <Azathoth> i should've capitalized it maybe, but that would have made the pun too obvious
[21:11] <Azathoth> well, whatever.
[21:12] <blaster> The reason every computer in the Uk is terrible is because all the companies jam it with 8GB of ram but the computer has such a terrible processor that it can only use 2gb of that ram......

[21:12] <blaster> All internetz going slow

[21:14] <Koko|Klass> hrm
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> you know
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> I would like dirt to be more useful

[21:14] <Azathoth> yeah
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> what
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> you do nothing with it
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> maybe make a dirt pile
[21:14] <Marach> Koko|Klass: dirt is everywhere. why would it be useful
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> >_>
[21:14] <Azathoth> blaster, you need all the ram you can get :|
[21:14] <Hell_Fire> I throw it off the floating island and watch it fall off and disappear
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> haha
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> resource waste!

[21:14] <Koko|Klass> well you can, Marach, that's true
[21:14] <Koko|Klass> oooh!
[21:14] <Azathoth> and farm with it
[21:15] <Koko|Klass> you could make a hobbit hut!
[21:15] <Koko|Klass> :D
[21:15] <Hell_Fire> it's dirt, and besides, I'm mining out the bottom of the floating island, so got plenty of stone
[21:15] <Koko|Klass> Hell_Fire, that's what I love to do
[21:15] <Marach> well. when monster will be able to actually break though defences, dirt will be probably the worst thing to build with (after sand :D)
[21:15] <Azathoth> it's just i usually end up with chests full of dirt, and i have nothing to do with it, so i just save it because i don't like to waste resourecs
[21:15] <Marach> ...but sand falls, so by making pillars it would take long for monsters to get in

[21:19] <Marach> s
[21:19] <Azathoth> i guess the name "minecraft" should've given it away

[21:19] <blaster> When I joined was just after wood was changed from yellow bricks to what it is now
[21:20] <Vicrry> Does the generator put sand anywhere other than the beach?
[21:20] <Marach> i dont think so
[21:20] <Koko|Klass> not in infdev I don't think
[21:20] <Koko|Klass> in indev you can generate a Paradise though
[21:20] <blaster> Because it puts it in low down areas
[21:20] <Koko|Klass> and that's full of sand
[21:20] <Azathoth> i figured it would be more like WoW or something where you go find big rocks sticking out of the ground and mine them for resources, not really affecting the environment at all
[21:20] <Koko|Klass> like all over the damn place
[21:20] <Marach> minecraft used to be so great back then :(

[21:24] <blaster> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?user=blaster&id=3
[21:24] <Azathoth> some speculate you'll be able to dig straight to hell. others want buildable portals.... who knows what other shit people have thought of
[21:24] <blaster> I think thats the oldest map you can get
[21:24] <Koko|Klass> personally I think a really cool level would be where the entire level is just dirt, stone, ore, etc, filled entirely to the ceiling of the level
[21:24] <Koko|Klass> and you just spawn in a tunnel with some torches
[21:24] <blaster> I built on it a bit but everything is nostalgiay except a few steps and bricks
[21:25] <Azathoth> i hope he doesn't give up before making dungeons and levers
[21:25] <blaster> Anyone ever played ant mode where you tunnel through glass?
[21:25] <Azathoth> randomly generated infinite roguelike dungeons in minecraft would be sex
[21:25] <blaster> YES
[21:25] <blaster> Better than orgasm
[21:25] <LuciferZ> I've played that, Blaster
[21:25] <Azathoth> yup
[21:25] <LuciferZ> Animator made a map for it on Dysgalt's D3
[21:25] <blaster> That map?
[21:26] <LuciferZ> No, antfarm.
[21:26] <Koko|Klass> so I just clicked on that link
[21:26] <blaster> Anyway Marach is that nostalgiay enough
[21:26] * gear1 (Administra@c-76-110-75-142.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[21:26] <Marach> it is.
[21:26] <Azathoth> nope
[21:26] <gear1> woo
[21:26] <Azathoth> woo woo
[21:26] <Splatticus> Hmmm.
[21:27] * Azathoth just discovered Windows Key + Tab in Windows 7... It's kind of pointless, but cool at the same time.
[21:27] <blaster> 0.0.13a - Level saving Its the first map that I saved, just after saving was put in
[21:27] * Subculture (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[21:27] <Ten_Tacles> What shall I do with the cave swallow men?
[21:27] <Azathoth> eat it
[21:28] <Splatticus> In my honest opinion, I think after some extreme level of blocks, there should be both a paradise level and a hell level. :U One filled with monsters, the other completely empty of them.. And then you can build a massive staircase between the two and have monsters seige paradise.
[21:28] <Azathoth> in my honest opinion, i think it would be lame
[21:28] <Azathoth> paradise wouldn't have a sky D:
[21:28] <Splatticus> Maybe in a certain concentration, monsters actually -generate- darkness..
[21:28] <Splatticus> It would have a sky.
[21:29] <Splatticus> An unmoving second sun hovering eternally at noon.
[21:29] <Azathoth> but...
[21:29] <Azathoth> you dig downward into it?
[21:29] <Splatticus> Upward.
[21:29] <LuciferZ> What if clouds became vapor blocks
[21:29] <Splatticus> Build a staircase.
[21:29] <LuciferZ> And if you climb far enough
[21:29] <Azathoth> so the normal world doesn't have a sky?
[21:29] <LuciferZ> They get so dense that you can walk on them.
[21:29] <Azathoth> you can't walk on clouds, silly
[21:29] <MercilessTD> god can
[21:29] <LuciferZ> THIS IS FUCKING MINECRAFT
[21:30] <Azathoth> we are but mortals
[21:30] <Splatticus> Suddenly you hit a wall of vapor-like bricks, dig through them.
[21:30] <Azathoth> no
[21:30] <Vicrry> so, what's the best method for draining a lake?
[21:30] <Azathoth> not dig
[21:30] <blaster> What version did you join on? I joined on 0.0.12a
[21:30] <Azathoth> use a bucket :D
[21:30] <LuciferZ> And above said vapor is paradise
[21:30] <MercilessTD> fucking vapour how does that work
[21:30] <Splatticus> That would be awesome.
[21:30] <Splatticus> U:
[21:30] <Azathoth> viccry, in indev?
[21:30] <Splatticus> About twenty bricks worth of ore/dirt ontop of the ore.
[21:30] <Vicrry> Indev

[21:31] * cheezychicken (cheezychic@saqqara.demon.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
[21:31] <Splatticus> Then flat w/ trees, porkchoppies and sheep.
[21:31] <Azathoth> if it's not connected to any outside source of water, just clear a block on the edge of the lake and wait
[21:31] <Vicrry> Cause I've built a seawall, and if I go down to the bottom and dig another cube out a layer of water disappears.
[21:31] <Vicrry> Dunno why that is
[21:31] <Splatticus> Fill it with dirt, Vicrry.
[21:31] <Azathoth> it makes sense
[21:31] * Splatticus peers longingly at Infdev, sigh.
[21:31] <Vicrry> I filled one with dirt, one reason why the epic hole I dug took so long
[21:32] <Azathoth> if you dig out a cube underwater, the water on top falls into the hole you've just created, ultimately resulting in a hole in the water at the top
[21:32] <Azathoth> and a hole in water results in evaporation of the entire layer
[21:32] <blaster> Ya know that notch said that if you go far enough from the center in infdev the game begins to fail
[21:33] <blaster> Has anyone actualy reached out there through glitch/hack/teleport
[21:33] <Azathoth> you begin to fail
[21:33] <blaster> :<
[21:33] <Splatticus> Blaster.
[21:33] <Splatticus> CrazySpai has a like, 750mb map.
[21:33] <Vicrry> woo, I is making me a sand/gravel quarry

[21:33] <Splatticus> Past 750mb, I don't think it'll ever matter.
[21:34] <Azathoth> I THINK IT WILL
[21:34] <Azathoth> i'm going to build a city that covers the entire map
[21:34] <Splatticus> Once multiplayer infdev comes out, I bet we'll start seeing the gig sized maps.
[21:34] * Kimd41 (chatzilla@212.183.196.16.dyn.user.ono.com) has joined #minecraft
[21:34] <blaster> If it can crash the server it will
[21:34] <Splatticus> A city that covers the entirity of infdev..
[21:34] <Splatticus> What is this, Coruscant?
[21:34] <Azathoth> YEP
[21:34] <blaster> Even the whole 6billion people havent covered 1 earth in citys yet, let alone 8 earths...
[21:34] <rbos> I'm not too worried about maps, I'd love to allocate a couple terabytes to a huge multiplayer map
[21:34] <Azathoth> you build a lot faster in minecraft than in real life though, blastef
[21:34] <Splatticus> Yes, rbos.
[21:35] <Vicrry> Gravel useful for crafting anything, or is it just an interesting building material?
[21:35] <blaster> You dont build at the speed of 6billion people though
[21:35] <Splatticus> You get flint from gravel.
[21:35] <Azathoth> i do
[21:35] <Azathoth> i'm pro at minecraft
[21:35] <Splatticus> I'd like to see how multiplayer infdev sorts out.
[21:35] <rbos> I suspect maps would be very compressible, too, so running minecraft on a compressed filesystem would probably work quite well
[21:35] <blaster> I have most likely played longer than you, what version did you join?
[21:35] <Marach> rbos: maps are compressed
[21:35] <rbos> if space becomes an issue, notch could probably optimize the file format just by running it through a zip module
[21:36] <rbos> oh, even better then
[21:36] <Splatticus> blaster, stop trying to measure your minecraftian e-peen against others.
[21:36] <blaster> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history for a guide to versions if you dont know
[21:36] <Splatticus> It makes you look like a twat.
[21:36] <rbos> so it'll probably never get very large
[21:36] <blaster> You mean me brickpeen
[21:36] <Azathoth> blaster, that doesn't mean you've got more playing time
[21:36] <Azathoth> also, we've both had indev the same amount of time, which is what really matters
[21:36] <Splatticus> He has a point.
[21:36] <blaster> fine...
[21:36] <blaster> I had an idea
[21:36] <Splatticus> I stop playing between updates.
[21:36] <rbos> any word on when infdev will be updated?
[21:37] <blaster> Anyone know how to cound block placements in minecraft?
[21:37] <Splatticus> It got updated last night.
[21:37] <Azathoth> i fucking won the minecraft CPL
[21:37] <Splatticus> Shhh.
[21:37] <rbos> it did, but there's bugs.
[21:37] <Splatticus> Be patient.
[21:37] <Splatticus> Notch will update when he gets it done.
[21:37] <rbos> I am, I was just wondering. :)
[21:37] <Marach> rbos: maps are compressed with gunzip
[21:37] <Azathoth> i'll own all you noobs at minecraft
[21:37] <Splatticus> He said "He'll work on it tonight." Like, two hours ago.
[21:37] <rbos> oh, cool, thanks for the update.
[21:37] <Marach> Azathoth: what was the former name of OMEN?
[21:38] <Splatticus> Correction, 3 hours.
[21:38] <blaster> OME
[21:38] <Azathoth> why would i give a fuck, marach?
[21:38] <Azathoth> i've never bothered with that shit
[21:38] <Splatticus> @icereed Yeah, I know what's causing it. I'll fix it tonight. =) about 3 hours ago via web in reply to icereed
[21:38] <Marach> ha! you dont own
[21:38] <Azathoth> that's not even minecraft
[21:38] <Azathoth> minecraft is it's own map editor
[21:38] <Azathoth> i'm so 1337 i don't need OMEN
[21:38] <blaster> In what version was gravel removed completely?
[21:39] <Hell_Fire> blaster: just hasn't been added to infdev yet
[21:39] <vede> It's weird how people still capitalize Omen.
[21:39] <blaster> Before then
[21:39] <vede> It started as OME, because it was an acronym.
[21:39] <vede> But, uh, it's not an acronym anymore.
[21:39] <Koko|Klass> it isn't?
[21:39] <Hell_Fire> blaster: was still in 0.31 indev, at least it's in my level
[21:39] <vede> Nope.
[21:39] <Azathoth> i don't memorize version numbers. i'm too busy being leet fragging you noobs
[21:40] <Koko|Klass> there aren't any frags!
[21:40] <vede> Osici didn't want his name in it, because he wanted to open it up to the community, so he renamed it to "Omen"

[21:43] <Koko|Klass> sand is DEADLY

[21:43] <Azathoth> dude
[21:43] <Azathoth> there should be a block monster
[21:43] <Hell_Fire> or is it
[21:44] <Koko|Klass> like a rock toad?
[21:44] <Koko|Klass> that just looks like some rocks until you mine it
[21:44] <Koko|Klass> and then it's like RAAAWOOR

[21:44] <Koko|Klass> Azathoth, so some chameleon mob?
[21:44] <Azathoth> yes
[21:45] <Koko|Klass> that'd be pretty darn rad
[21:45] <Koko|Klass> maybe it should be just slightly off-colored
[21:45] <Azathoth> you'd be like "hmm.... i don't remember that block being there"
[21:45] <Koko|Klass> or, it should take like juuust a little while
[21:45] <Koko|Klass> for it to get fully colored like the blocks it's near
[21:45] <Koko|Klass> so you might be able to tell what it is in the daylight if you catch it quick enough
[21:45] <rbos> that would be quite a lot like the Angels in Doctor Who

[21:54] * cheezychicken (cheezychic@saqqara.demon.co.uk) has left #minecraft

[21:54] <blaster> I have made 5 things like that
[21:54] <Koko|Klass> so you guys
[21:54] <LuciferZ> No, no texture layering
[21:54] <LuciferZ> Gore simply makes red cloth
[21:54] <LuciferZ> Only way to get it
[21:54] <Koko|Klass> Notch has said he wants any block but Obsidian to fall.
[21:54] <blaster> Arnt webs and gears layer texturing?
[21:54] <LuciferZ> Is to murder gratuitously.
[21:54] * Subculture (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[21:55] <Koko|Klass> ideas on how that'll look when it happens?
[21:55] <Splatticus> Awesome.
[21:55] <Koko|Klass> do you think stuff will fall from the sky like Sand?
[21:55] <blaster> I think blood would give some particle effects to combat
[21:55] <Splatticus> It'd be like Mr.Digger.
[21:55] <Koko|Klass> or do you think he'll actually have to animate falling, like he does with Dynamite?
[21:55] <blaster> Large things falling from sky leaving craters please
[21:55] <Splatticus> No, it'd be falling like sand.
[21:55] <Azathoth> i think rain should be falling water blocks
[21:55] <Marach> i dont really understand dynamite
[21:55] <Koko|Klass> that's some huge-ass rain
[21:55] <Azathoth> it would look so ridiculously stupid
[21:55] <Splatticus> What is this, Ants?
[21:55] <Marach> why did he even make it like that
[21:55] <Azathoth> but it would be amazing
[21:56] <Marach> not just another block.
[21:56] <Hell_Fire> damn, that'd make floating islands hard, you dig out a tile at the bottom accidentally and there'd be no replacing it, it's just gone
[21:56] <Koko|Klass> well not really.
[21:56] <Koko|Klass> I think when he says "any block but obsidian"
[21:56] <Koko|Klass> blocks connected to obsidian
[21:56] <Koko|Klass> would still float.
[21:56] <Splatticus> Hell_Fire does have a point.
[21:56] <Koko|Klass> you know?
[21:56] * Marach wants infinite floating islands
[21:56] <Splatticus> No.
[21:56] <Koko|Klass> um
[21:56] <Koko|Klass> yes
[21:56] * Cue (cueball61@cpc4-alde1-0-0-cust997.glfd.cable.ntl.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[21:56] <Azathoth> UM NO
[21:56] <Koko|Klass> in fact Notch specifically said that.
[21:57] <Splatticus> Maybe if Obsidian was the bottom of the island.
[21:57] <blaster> I see what notch means by infinite development, it will NEVER be finished
[21:57] <Azathoth> in fact notch specifically said that you're gay
[21:57] <Koko|Klass> well I am gay
[21:57] <Koko|Klass> so Notch is right again
[21:57] <Azathoth> ewww don't talk to me
[21:57] <Koko|Klass> anyway, http://www.toodledo.com/views/public.php?id=td4b49fbf9c05a0
[21:57] <Azathoth> :D
[21:57] <Koko|Klass> down at the bottom
[21:57] <Azathoth> nope
[21:57] <Koko|Klass> "Floating islands would need obsidian veins to stay afloat."
[21:57] <Koko|Klass> therefore, a single vein of obsidian would be enough to keep a structure in the air.
[21:58] <Azathoth> you need obsidian veins to stay afloat
[21:58] <blaster> Combat should be like dwarf fortress, where you can bite someones pancreas out!
[21:58] <rbos> I wonder if he's planning to add structural stresses, then
[21:58] <Koko|Klass> oh jeez, rbos
[21:58] <Azathoth> lol
[21:58] <Marach> Koko|Klass: like Core in cave story? :O
[21:58] <Koko|Klass> that sounds like complicated programming
[21:58] <Koko|Klass> Marach I don't know what core or cave story are D:
[21:58] <rbos> it would be a lot of CPU load
[21:58] <LuciferZ> So basically
[21:58] <Azathoth> mine faction: guerilla
[21:58] * Marach raeps Koko|Klass
[21:58] <Hell_Fire> lol, nah, just make it so one block of obsidian can "hold" so many other blocks
[21:58] <LuciferZ> Anything floating must be connected either directly or indirectly to a piece of obsidian
[21:59] * geekahedron (geekahedro@cpe-24-59-7-67.twcny.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[21:59] <rbos> well, if there's going to be obsidian blocks, then there'll need to be some way to distribute the "flying" property
[21:59] <Azathoth> i don't think there should be a certain type of block that holds others up
[21:59] <rbos> LuciferZ: yeah, that sounds right
[21:59] <AndrewPH> anything floating must be connected either directly or indirectly to cave story
[21:59] <Marach> ^
[21:59] <blaster> Flying pigs made of obsidian yes
[21:59] <LuciferZ> Fair enough.
[21:59] <Azathoth> i think some kind of simplistic structural stress system would be enough
[21:59] <Marach> and/or Avatar, of course
[21:59] <Azathoth> basically just something to prevent free floating blocks
[21:59] <Koko|Klass> oh lord that'd be awesome if you could attach blocks to mobs
[21:59] <Koko|Klass> XD
[21:59] <LuciferZ> Floating castles would only need one obsidian block, but you would want a lot of them
[21:59] <Koko|Klass> they'd be like O_O;;
[21:59] <AndrewPH> Anything with a giant floating walnut for a boss must be related directly or indirectly to cave story
[21:59] <LuciferZ> So that they can't be sabotaged.
[21:59] <Koko|Klass> I would totally build my castle on top of an army of pigs
[21:59] <Koko|Klass> if you could stick blocks on mobs
[21:59] <Azathoth> or maybe stone blocks must have a grounded pillar adjacent to them to stay afloat
[22:00] <blaster> Anyone noticed that creepers are suicide bombers
[22:00] <LuciferZ> And obsidian takes an assload of time to mine
[22:00] <Hell_Fire> blaster: havn't they always been?
[22:00] <Koko|Klass> no, blaster, nobody has noticed that ever
[22:00] <LuciferZ> So you would want to use TNT to destroy them.
[22:00] <Azathoth> wood blocks can be placed anywhere as long as they're connected to something that's grounded
[22:00] <Marach> blaster: NOT AT ALL
[22:00] <Azathoth> lol @ blaster
[22:00] <AndrewPH> afk morrowind
[22:00] <blaster> Imagine the situation, your on a block plane, and someone turned of the light in the toilet and a creeper spawns in the toilet...

[22:02] <Azathoth> my penis
[22:03] <s3krit> blaster: it's not even that. it's anyone that's not white pretty much
[22:03] <Drewseph_> I do think something like an upgrade to arrows would be nice
[22:03] <Koko|Klass> your penis lights your pants on fire?
[22:03] <Koko|Klass> that sounds like a really impractical penis
[22:03] <Drewseph_> so i don't waste 5 arrows per enemy
[22:03] <Marach> lol
[22:03] <Azathoth> yes
[22:03] <Koko|Klass> you should see a doctor about that

[22:03] <Azathoth> it needs tit blocks

[22:04] <Marach> LOL
[22:04] <Kokopure> if creepers are attracted to tits
[22:04] <Kokopure> we need something else to try and anally violate things with penises
[22:04] <Hell_Fire> sounds like a good excuse for minecraft art if I heard one
[22:04] <Azathoth> that and children NPCs
[22:04] <s3krit> the game is going in a bizarre direction
[22:04] <Marach> Hell_Fire: we already have art
[22:04] <blaster> They rape female players, after all they are just giant green exploding penis
[22:04] <s3krit> I kinda like it
[22:04] <Marach> idk about infdev, but there is some in indev
[22:04] <s3krit> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

[22:10] <Vicrry> I left them in my greenhouse with a glass block right above them so they can't be stepped on, but the tilled soil and wheat on it are still reverting to grass

[22:11] <DarkWolf> As in, it didn't
[22:11] <blaster> Cant save it online
[22:12] <Splatticus> You have to manually save on the window it pops up in.
[22:12] <Azathoth> you can only save files, darkwolf
[22:12] <DarkWolf> I saved it locally

[22:13] <Azathoth> are you using the load file button to load it? :P
[22:13] <DarkWolf> Yes?
[22:13] <Azathoth> and the file doesn't appear there?
[22:13] <Splatticus> wtf downloading update in indev?
[22:13] <Azathoth> or it does appear, but won't load?

[22:26] <LuciferZ> Your mom's a trap
[22:27] <AndrewPH> vurtual, yes they are
[22:27] <bildramer> DarkWolf: no
[22:27] <vurtual> If you do have one, it's easy to set up them as an amp.
[22:27] <bildramer> but I fucking finally got some 3D working
[22:27] <bildramer> I should do shmup

[22:53] <Azathoth> turn earth into coruscant

[22:56] <Azathoth> god seriously.
[22:57] <Azathoth> hurr durr lightsaber duel every 5 seconds

[22:57] <bildramer> where
[22:57] <bildramer> my code must suck
[22:57] <Azathoth> did you watch that phantom menace review that was longer than the actual movie?
[22:57] <vurtual> maybe ten thousand years into the future, there'll be a redo o the sequels that doesn't suck? Then again that breaks the laws of physics, and CGI will probably be important there
[22:58] <vurtual> woah the phantom menace is under 70 min long?
[22:58] <Azathoth> i thought the review was longer than 70 minutes?
[22:58] <Azathoth> oh, i guess you're right. it's 7 parts of 10 minutes
[22:58] <vurtual> no exactly 70min within a few seconds
[22:58] <Azathoth> still
[22:58] <vurtual> escape from the planet... of boring.
[22:58] <Azathoth> long review
[22:59] <Azathoth> is F5 refresh?
[22:59] <vurtual> yes
[22:59] <vurtual> ctrl+F5 is super refresh

[23:00] <vurtual> the only key shortcuts I use are things like switch-to-saved-units

[23:00] <Azathoth> me too
[23:00] <Ten_Tacles> The only ones.
[23:00] <Azathoth> but good RTS players know all the hotkeys
[23:00] <vurtual> except force commander where you had to use a button to reliably activate the special ability of units.
[23:00] <vurtual> then again nobody else liked force commander, like, nobody.
[23:01] <vurtual> I've never really seen anyone actually liking it, ever.
[23:01] <Azathoth> i've never even heard of it :\
[23:01] <vurtual> star wars rts where you play as some guy
[23:01] <Azathoth> oh
[23:01] <vurtual> then stuff happens
[23:01] <vurtual> it has a story and was pretty fun even in skirmish mode, because you could do things like turn up max points at the beginning and quickly buy AT-ATs
[23:01] <Azathoth> well it looks like it got decent ratings
[23:01] <bildramer> http://imgur.com/yJMHP.png
[23:02] <vurtual> then have them die because soldiers ran under it
[23:02] <Azathoth> i still have never heard of it though

[23:02] <vurtual> or get easily defeated by snowspeeders

[23:05] <bildramer> THAT WAS A JOKE, HAHA, FAT CHANCE
[23:05] <Splatticus> Considering.
[23:05] <vurtual> I wonder what the battle of yavin would be like if it was fought by land forces on the death star's surface?
[23:05] <Azathoth> bildramer, you broke my heart and killed me
[23:05] <Splatticus> I've been mining this little sea-tunnel in indev for a while.
[23:05] <vurtual> it doesn't have external gravity does it?
[23:05] <Splatticus> And I just found a hole in which I see light and a sheep.
[23:05] <Splatticus> So where did my sea go?
[23:05] <Azathoth> i don't think the death store is physically possible anyway
[23:06] <vurtual> It is if you designed it right.
[23:06] <Azathoth> it probably all evaporated splatticus
[23:06] <Jat> is infdevs constant hard driving fucking anyone else over?

[23:12] <Azathoth> are you dividing by that cosine?
[23:12] <bildramer> 50*cos(random)*cos(random) can't be less than -100...?
[23:12] <bildramer> what the hell
[23:12] <Azathoth> can't be less than -50
[23:12] <bildramer> yes, but I add 100

[23:12] <Azathoth> and that's what you're dividing by?
[23:12] <Azathoth> what's the fulll line of code in question?
[23:12] <blaster> if math.random(1,10) == 1 then
[23:12] <bildramer> and that variable reaching zero is the only way to divide by zero
[23:13] <blaster> script.Value2.Value = (math.random(1,10) - (E / 15 ))
[23:13] <blaster> end
[23:13] <blaster> Just do that
[23:13] <Jat> wat
[23:13] <Splatticus> I'm going to be pissed and impressed if I borked this and ended up making a tower that has it's top at sea level.
[23:13] <bildramer> let's just say I'm doing 1/(100+50*cos((j+1)*PI/18)*(1-cos(i*PI/36)))
[23:13] <Azathoth> lol wat
[23:13] <Jat> blaster what the fuck is that?
[23:13] <blaster> f i == 1 then

[23:13] <Jat> oh
[23:13] <bildramer> ...?
[23:13] <Azathoth> if the cos = 1, then you've got a 0
[23:13] <Splatticus> ...
[23:14] <Splatticus> What.
[23:14] <Splatticus> the shit.
[23:14] <blaster> Its teh bohm
[23:14] <bildramer> yes
[23:14] <vurtual> Gun looks like an M16A4 or M16A2
[23:14] <Splatticus> Fyi my sea is still there.
[23:14] <bildramer> so 50 * anything * 0
[23:14] <Splatticus> And it's night time.
[23:14] <bildramer> which is 0
[23:14] <vurtual> But it's a bit shorter than an M4
[23:14] <Azathoth> yeah. and then you're dividing by that
[23:14] <bildramer> adding 100 = 100
[23:14] <Splatticus> What fucking light was that? > >
[23:14] <vurtual> While having none of the defining qualities
[23:14] <bildramer> nope
[23:14] <Azathoth> oh
[23:14] <Azathoth> missed that
[23:14] <bildramer> but yet it happened only when I added the "1-"
[23:14] <bildramer> *yet

[23:15] <Azathoth> it must be evaluating to -100 then
[23:15] <Azathoth> somehow
[23:15] <bildramer> somehow
[23:15] <Azathoth> i'm not entirely sure how...
[23:15] <bildramer> :/
[23:16] <vurtual> someone is out fighting a snake right now
[23:16] <blaster> Bildramer what are you doing with your trigonometry?
[23:16] <vurtual> disregarding any venom or possible injury?
[23:16] <bildramer> making a sphere
[23:16] <bildramer> sorta
[23:16] <blaster> Shouldent you be using pie for that
[23:16] <bildramer> http://imgur.com/9Wy3L.png

[23:16] <Jat> bildramer
[23:16] <bildramer> = 3.141593
[23:16] <blaster> I know...
[23:16] <bildramer> I do
[23:16] <bildramer> Jat
[23:17] <bildramer> whatcha want
[23:17] <Jat> 1-cos(0) = 2
[23:17] <Azathoth> 1-cos(0) = 0?
[23:17] <Jat> no
[23:17] <bildramer> no
[23:17] <Jat> yes
[23:17] <bildramer> yes
[23:17] <Jat> i mean -PI
[23:17] <bildramer> well
[23:17] <Azathoth> oh yeah
[23:17] <Jat> 1-cos(-PI) = 2
[23:17] <Azathoth> 1-(-1) = 2
[23:17] <bildramer> no problem, goes to 200 then
[23:17] <Azathoth> no
[23:17] <bildramer> Azathoth: fail
[23:17] <vurtual> so I also had a dream last night where a big snake tried to attack me, I grabbed it, then later came back and got venom'd
[23:18] <Jat> wait no
[23:18] <Jat> its cos(0)
[23:18] <bildramer> :l
[23:18] <Jat> no
[23:18] <bildramer> yes, cos(0)
[23:18] <Jat> cos(PI)
[23:18] <bildramer> cos(0) = 1
[23:18] <blaster> I know a pattern in PI, look at 141, 535 and 979. It goes XYX alot.
[23:18] <Jat> COS(PI)
[23:18] <Jat> =-1
[23:18] <vurtual> so I tried to call 911 but it was like just cause 2 so I ended up calling the reapers, which may or may not have required calling actual medical help
[23:18] <Jat> 1--1 = 2
[23:18] <vurtual> that was a funny dream :(
[23:18] <Jat> 1-cos(PI) = 1 - (-1) = 2
[23:18] <bildramer> cos(pi) = -1? wtf
[23:18] <bildramer> oh
[23:18] <bildramer> -1
[23:18] <Splatticus> Well guys.
[23:18] <bildramer> well
[23:18] <Jat> thats why it happened when you added the -1
[23:18] <bildramer> still
[23:18] <Splatticus> We'll never know the mystery.
[23:19] <Jat> i mean the 1-
[23:19] <bildramer> 200, no prob
[23:19] <Jat> not the -1
[23:19] <Splatticus> I'm about to die. ]: And indev doesn't respawn you.
[23:19] <blaster> Maby you should carry the 4
[23:19] <Azathoth> you sure, bildramer?
[23:19] <Jat> hold on
[23:19] <Jat> let me show you
[23:19] <bildramer> I'll just use sin
[23:19] <Azathoth> that first cosine could be -1 at the same time as the second one?
[23:19] <Jat> that wont help

[23:21] * Splatticus is playing in indev, what are you talking about.
[23:21] <bildramer> *oh
[23:21] <bildramer> I shouldn't be using trigonometry for that at all
[23:21] <Jat> infdev i think he means
[23:21] <Azathoth> yeah
[23:21] <bildramer> it should be sqrt(x^2-1) or something
[23:21] <Azathoth> missed the f
[23:21] <s3krit> hehehe
[23:21] <vurtual> ok give me suggestions to kill a snake with
[23:21] <Jat> bildramer wtf are you trying to do?
[23:21] <Azathoth> i'm bad at typing
[23:21] <bildramer> make a sphere
[23:21] <Jat> how?
[23:21] <bildramer> That is the radius, based on the height
[23:21] <vurtual> Current ideas are: Shotgun(flak jacket would be needed), fire(might set everything on fire)
[23:22] <Azathoth> erm
[23:22] <blaster> On September 21, 1997, a divide by zero error on board the USS Yorktown (CG-48). Remote Data Base Manager brought down all the machines on the network, causing the ship's propulsion system to fail
[23:22] <bildramer> and it goes from 0 to 1 to 0
[23:22] <Splatticus> What is this roblox bullshit?
[23:22] <Azathoth> radius based on height?
[23:22] <Jat> wat

[23:23] <bildramer> wtf
[23:23] <Jat> lol
[23:23] <bildramer> the imaginary part?
[23:23] <bildramer> then it's 1 - x^2
[23:23] <Azathoth> i thought you were trying to figure out the radius from the diameter of the circle or something
[23:23] <Azathoth> i was like wtf?
[23:23] <blaster> So do you like dem roblox /infdev/ more than minecraft /infdev/
[23:24] <Splatticus> Idk it just feels like a gay version of minecraft.
