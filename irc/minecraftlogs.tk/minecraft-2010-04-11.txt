[3:37] <vurtual> There is, entirely, the possiblity of a strange phenomenon where some people will... almost speak as if they were the person they are talking to.
[3:37] <cryzed> kanti, it says you are female
[3:37] <vurtual> In formal settings, this often results in people, predicatably, acting more formal, rather than relaxed, as they normally are.
[3:38] <vurtual> However, with the modern invention of the internet, it can cause more varied people to assume wildly different personalities, to the point that it seems almost inhuman.

[4:09] <Snowman> It's a fucking transmorgiphing (right?) robot?
[4:09] <vurtual> and maybe whips?
[4:09] <vurtual> JC2-style piracy
[4:10] <Snowman> OH HAI! IM ON A STREAM!
[4:10] <DimJim> you mean
[4:10] <DimJim> destroying a country's water towers for a regime change
[4:10] <vurtual> ye olde pirace
[4:10] <DimJim> :|
[4:10] <EmpiresBane> Animator, have you tried using streaming the game?
[4:10] <vurtual> no DimJim you fought on boats before right
[4:10] <rcfighter> If Minecraft gets customizable moving-block vehicles... I'm going to build Balrog, and have the driver's seat on top of his head.
[4:10] <vurtual> generally jumping from boat to boat, ripping people out of the boats
[4:10] <Animator> Hm. No, not really.
[4:10] <EmpiresBane> rather than your screen?
[4:10] <DimJim> i did that boat floodgate thing
[4:11] <vurtual> well, basically, I will find a large body of water, with ships
[4:11] * DimJim just realized that rico is part of the agency which is the same name of the big evil people thing in a blurred line.
[4:11] <vurtual> maybe ships holding POSESSIONS, and HOUSEBOATS
[4:11] <vurtual> "The agency"
[4:11] <vurtual> refers to the CIA apparently
[4:11] <Animator> LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.
[4:12] <vurtual> Anyways yeah, ride a fast boat around
[4:12] <DimJim> what animator
[4:12] <Animator> EmpiresBane, can you watch over my stream to see if it works?
[4:12] <vurtual> Then jump ontop of my boat, and grappling hook onto boats
[4:12] <DimJim> are you referring to escape from lashe city
[4:12] <EmpiresBane> ok
[4:12] <vurtual> like old pirates/privateers

[4:13] <vurtual> then, cut said rigging
[4:14] <vurtual> Also on the topic of what inspired this, JC2 has so much stuff in it that you'll almost never notice. I realised there's like... unique music for when you're sitting around doing mostly nothing.

[4:56] <vurtual> I would just call you insensitive/stupid
[4:56] <LuciferZ> Vurtual we would all be dead
[4:56] <Brett> lmfao
[4:56] <vurtual> But intelligence and religiousness are very unique and seperate things.
[4:57] <LuciferZ> Word. Some of history's most intelligent people were religious. Some of them weren't.
[4:57] <vurtual> Less now because there's less religious peopl
[4:57] <Animator> Guys, guys, guys.
[4:57] <vurtual> more then because religion was a more common thing
[4:57] <Animator> Try and steal and grab my balls.
[4:57] <Animator> http://stealgame.com/play
[4:57] <LuciferZ> But there's about the same amount of intelligent people
[4:58] <vurtual> no no, more
[4:58] <vurtual> I think the "religious people" number goes up slower than the "people" number
[4:58] <LuciferZ> Because the world population has gone up, lol.
[4:58] <LuciferZ> Right.
[4:58] <vurtual> and the "intelligent people" number is between them, leaning towards "people"
[4:58] <vurtual> technically this says that at least some religious people have to be intelligent.
[5:00] <Animator> Well, I placed all the green balls into a neat little pile. I am the king of big green balls.
[5:00] <vurtual> at least they ain't blue

[5:02] <LuciferZ> Lol, Brett, I was kidding. No need to get angsty.
[5:02] <LuciferZ> I don't believe in an interfering god.
[5:02] <Brett> i wasn't, that's my magic bullet for every religious argument
[5:02] <Brett> it hasn't failed to work
[5:02] <LuciferZ> It was totally irrelevant in this one though.
[5:03] <LuciferZ> So now I use your inability to follow the debate to prove that Brett=dumb

[5:22] <Griskard> Would basically any move wipe out the other guy?
[5:22] <GameGameLOL> Depends on the level
[5:22] <Brett> hack a shuckle to have milk drink and roost using an action replay and then give it harden and light barrier

[5:23] <GameGameLOL> ...
[5:23] <vurtual> maybe if milk drink worked on pokemon of the opposite gender, and made them reluctant to attack, while also restoring hp
[5:23] <vurtual> that'd be cool
[5:23] <vurtual> incredibly erotic, full of innuendo

[5:26] <vurtual> no
[5:26] <GameGameLOL> O:
[5:26] <vurtual> I think I have enough games to stream forever
[5:26] <vurtual> not like anyone wants to watch someone play audiosurf distractedly, or fail at flying a plane
[5:27] <LuciferZ> Streaming is gay
[5:27] <LuciferZ> I said it.
[5:27] <LuciferZ> You all knew it
[5:27] <XMD> Streaming can be gay in very specific situations.
[5:27] <vurtual> I counter with this: http://img30.imageshack.us/img30/5841/alsomassivegamelist.png
[5:27] <vurtual> your argument is invalid
[5:27] <XMD> Blatantly, streaming gay videos is one of those situations.
[5:27] <GameGameLOL> My velociraptor keyboard elderly, your cocacola bottle is walled.
[5:28] <LuciferZ> Vurtual that image does nothing.
[5:28] <vurtual> It implies how rich and indifferent to peasant I am.
[5:28] <LuciferZ> Which does not have anything to do with the gayness of streaming
[5:28] <vurtual> begone peasant or I will begin a hunt! On expensive ATVs, using fancy rifles.

[6:35] <vurtual> wait wait wait guys
[6:35] <vurtual> Nuclear power plants only affect actual physical materials right
[6:35] <vurtual> PUT THEM IN SPACE
[6:35] <vurtual> deep not-orbit space, or orbiting something we don't need to worry about blowing up
[6:36] <Dysgalt> And then transfer the power
[6:36] <Dysgalt> to a microwave laser?
[6:36] <mail2345> you know
[6:36] <vurtual> yeah that's the only problem
[6:36] <mail2345> umm
[6:36] <Dysgalt> and aim it at microwave reciever?
[6:36] <vurtual> A physical cable could work
[6:36] <Varriount> I'm on my sisters iPod, he took away mine..
[6:36] <Dysgalt> AIM IT AT RANDOM VILLAGES
[6:36] <vurtual> shcokingly that's always been possible
[6:36] <mail2345> that also solves the problem
[6:36] <mail2345> of waste disposal
[6:36] <Dysgalt> Vurtual
[6:36] <Dysgalt> thats a really long cable
[6:36] <mail2345> (though it's a shitty long term solution
[6:36] <mail2345> as you can;t get the waste back
[6:36] <mail2345> for refining
[6:37] <mail2345> into breeders and nukes and suhc
[6:37] <vurtual> yes, we have the resources to build a solid, constant bridge to the moon
[6:37] <vurtual> in every last super building we make
[6:37] <vurtual> If you took all the skyscrapers we made, and put them into a moon bridge project
[6:37] <vurtual> You could make a massive bridge CITY that is habitable
[6:37] <Dysgalt> JJJJJJJJIIIIIIIIIIHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[6:37] <Dysgalt> boom goes your city
[6:37] <Dysgalt> what about the effects of gravity?
[6:38] <Dysgalt> Rotation?

[6:38] <Dysgalt> fuck this boys
[6:38] <vurtual> also another idea
[6:38] <Dysgalt> lets go to googles moon base
[6:38] <vurtual> what if you just made a reactor robot
[6:38] <vurtual> like, a nuclear power plant vehicle
[6:39] <vurtual> Maybe gigantic, a huge cooling stack with legs and energy rockets or whatever
[6:39] <mail2345> stop(); // Hammertime!
[6:39] <vurtual> And it does not radiate outside the structure
[6:39] <vurtual> You can just park it wherever convenient
[6:39] <Clockwork> actually
[6:39] <vurtual> If it's destaiblizing, and cannot be repaired, send it somewhere.
[6:39] <vurtual> land will continue to be reusable
[6:39] <Clockwork> russia is currently constructing something like that
[6:40] <Clockwork> only, they are making a reactor boat
[6:40] <vurtual> Also in b4 THE REACTOR IS EXPLODING! THROW IT INTO THE SUUUUUUNNNNN
[6:40] <vurtual> Too bad we don't have like, subspace microwave transmitters or whatever
[6:41] <vurtual> so we can just beam energy in a harmless format
[6:41] <Dysgalt> Japan is making something like that
[6:41] <Dysgalt> its a giant sattelite

[6:41] <Dysgalt> with solar panels and the solar panels collect energy
[6:41] <vurtual> Or wait, take a super-efficient nuclear reactor, maybe not very safe, make some gloomy, scary space station for it
[6:41] <Dysgalt> transfer it to a microwave transmitter
[6:41] <Dysgalt> Just fucking use a thorium reactor
[6:42] <Dysgalt> Thorium is harmless(Nearly) and its almost the same as uranium
[6:42] <vurtual> then make it use some of its power to create a gigantic tube
[6:42] <Dysgalt> in energy output
[6:42] <mail2345> idea
[6:42] <mail2345> how about
[6:42] <vurtual> some kinda energy shield, to shield a microwave beam
[6:42] <vurtual> so you don't get fried by accident
[6:42] <mail2345> we use the souls
[6:42] <mail2345> well
[6:42] <mail2345> actually
[6:42] <mail2345> best energy source
[6:43] <mail2345> the stupidity in this community
[6:43] <vurtual> actually that'd be cool to look at at least
[6:43] <vurtual> massive floating space stations, connected by rays of light

[6:45] <vurtual> brb getting 3d modelling software
[6:45] <vurtual> I haven't watched anything sci-fi in ages

[6:45] <mail2345> put the reactors
[6:45] <mail2345> underground
[6:45] <mail2345> :P
[6:45] <vurtual> but that's nowhere near as cool as this
[6:45] <mail2345> in like a desert
[6:45] <mail2345> so nobody complains

[6:50] <Clockwork> how cool (pu8n intended) is that
[6:51] <Clockwork> its liguid at like 500c btw

[7:45] <Silver_Shadow> funny Notch blog post
[7:46] <Silver_Shadow> Level size stats
[7:46] <Silver_Shadow> In the interview I just did for FAP radio, I mentioned doing the stats for how much space a full map would take.
[7:46] <Silver_Shadow> A fully explored minecraft map would take up somewhere between 100 and 200 petabytes. That?s 100,000-200,000 full 1TB disk drives.
[7:46] <Silver_Shadow> So, yes, I overstated a bit when I said there wasn?t enough hard drive space in Europe. :)
[7:46] <Silver_Shadow> I love notch

[7:47] <Drewseph> every game
[7:47] <Drewseph> not one does it right

[7:48] <Silver_Shadow> but with a multi option
[7:48] <vurtual> left 4 dead
[7:48] <Drewseph> focus**
[7:48] <Drewseph> ever that game wa dshard to come by people you could play with
[7:48] <Silver_Shadow> I cannot imagine what the caves and tunnels in infdev'd be like
[7:48] <Drewseph> so many fuck tards
[7:48] <vurtual> a few friends?

[7:49] <vurtual> soon you will have friends
[7:49] <Drewseph> but I get your point
[7:49] <vurtual> who like left 4 dead
[7:49] <Drewseph> I did
[7:49] <Drewseph> very much so
[7:49] <vurtual> oen guy I occasionally talk with/play l4d2 with(if l4d2 wasn't a can of suck)
[7:49] <Drewseph> but still, that game was built for multiplayer
[7:49] <vurtual> ALSO I HAVE AN ORIGINAL IDEA JUST NOW
[7:49] <Drewseph> this game is not
[7:49] <vurtual> minecraft was
[7:49] <Omicron_loves_notch> who lieked MW2
[7:49] <vurtual> nobody
[7:49] <vurtual> but here's my idea
[7:49] <Drewseph> not me
[7:49] <Drewseph> go
[7:49] <vurtual> You know the setting in Just Cause 2/ARMA 2
[7:49] <Dysgalt> The terrabyte generator is so fucking sweet
[7:49] <Omicron_loves_notch> how could you not love it?
[7:49] <Drewseph> kinda
[7:50] <vurtual> random Asian country, lots of similar features in both
[7:50] <vurtual> set a l4d campaign there
[7:50] <Drewseph> Pmni, cause its our opinion
[7:50] <Drewseph> and its a shitt ass war game
[7:50] <Drewseph> omni*
[7:50] <Silver_Shadow> aha
[7:50] <vurtual> it was like a dictatorship then SUDDENLY ZOMBIES ON THE ISLAND.
[7:50] <Silver_Shadow> found the post
[7:50] <Drewseph> fuck its dark in here
[7:50] <Silver_Shadow> observe:
[7:50] <vurtual> So you have to make it to a military base
[7:50] <Silver_Shadow> The world is 30 million blocks across. A block is one square meter.
[7:50] <Silver_Shadow> 30,000,000 meters is 30,000 km. 30,000*30.000 is 900,000,000, so the Minecraft world is nine hundred million square kilometers.
[7:50] <Silver_Shadow> The earth has a surface area of about 510 million square kilometers.
[7:50] <Silver_Shadow> It IS larger than the earth, people!
[7:50] <Omicron_loves_notch> how could anyone dislike the pure awsomesauceness that is MW2?
[7:50] <vurtual> Silver_Shadow
[7:50] <vurtual> we know.
[7:50] <vurtual> now shoo
[7:50] * Silver_Shadow shoos
[7:50] <vurtual> Omicron_loves_notch, because we have better games
[7:51] <Omicron_loves_notch> like?
[7:51] <vurtual> that don't charge us 15 for maps
[7:51] <vurtual> half-life
[7:51] <vurtual> infact you can get most of the half-life games except counter-strike for 15 dollars
[7:51] <vurtual> and then there's all the mods and maps you can download, made by people

[7:51] <Clockwork> I agree
[7:51] <Drewseph> Omnicron, because we fucking already played that game 10 times over
[7:51] <Drewseph> with all the other shitty war games
[7:52] <Omicron_loves_notch> im buying BC2,3 and MW 3 as soon as they all come out
[7:52] <Drewseph> THEY ARE ALL THE SAME
[7:52] <vurtual> bc2 is already out
[7:52] <vurtual> and no the games aren't all the same
[7:52] <Drewseph> point, shoot, kill, swear, grenade, rinse and repeat
[7:52] <Omicron_loves_notch> ...
[7:52] <vurtual> mw2 is lame and has problems, charges moneys
[7:52] <Omicron_loves_notch> BC2 IS OUT!

[7:52] <vurtual> just cause 2 is basically that
[7:52] <Drewseph> but there is a difference
[7:52] <Drewseph> HL is not a WAR game
[7:53] <Drewseph> I'm sick and tired of glorifications of armies
[7:53] <vurtual> MW2 is more like "come up with random silly system that's hillariously overpowered, be forced by peers with threatens of violence to keep playing"
[7:53] <Drewseph> and military
[7:53] <vurtual> Half-Life's entire saga is war after war what are you talking about
[7:53] <Drewseph> uh
[7:53] <Drewseph> not really
[7:53] <Drewseph> you are but one man
[7:53] <vurtual> 7 hour war
[7:53] <vurtual> the uprising
[7:53] <Drewseph> you belong to no organized military background
[7:53] <vurtual> the war between all the guys on xen vs combine
[7:53] <Omicron_loves_notch> Anyone here airsoft?
[7:53] <Drewseph> you don't talk in meat heat speech

[7:54] <vurtual> also repeat is especially in there in one spot, which has a really hard to defeat defense
[7:54] <vurtual> so you just repeat and repeat
[7:54] <vurtual> Omicron_loves_notch, I have real guns.
[7:54] <Silver_Shadow> I love you

[7:55] <Silver_Shadow> none :D
[7:55] <vurtual> then you won't
[7:55] <Silver_Shadow> I will
[7:55] <vurtual> any actual weapon experience in the whole point, use sights, shoot thing
[7:56] <Silver_Shadow> I know how
[7:56] <Silver_Shadow> Plyed Left 4 dead
[7:56] <vurtual> If you have some of that, and lots of FPS experience in certain FPSes(games like half-life sorta help, gauss jumping and picking offp eople helps ALOT)
[7:56] <vurtual> and games like quake
[7:56] <vurtual> then you will have good aim
[7:56] <vurtual> given that you've already fired firearms before
[7:56] <Silver_Shadow> I can kill zombies from long distances in indev
[7:56] <Silver_Shadow> lol
[7:57] <Silver_Shadow> fuck
[7:57] <Silver_Shadow> infdev glitched
[7:58] <vurtual> hmmm
[7:58] <vurtual> I think half-life has twice the sensitivity of hl2
[7:58] <Silver_Shadow> I tried to make a new level by clicking an empty lvl slot
[7:58] <vurtual> I set the sensitivity to 3.15 and it felt like 6.3 in hl2

[9:31] <KodaichiZero> why can't we see stars during the day?

[9:32] <Silver_Shadow> The sun blocks out all smaller light
[9:32] <mail2345> your mom
[9:32] <Marach> of course everyone else asked for different things
[9:32] <outsomnia> @Koda, because our eyes sak.

[9:32] <Silver_Shadow> lawl
[9:32] <KodaichiZero> alright
[9:32] <mail2345> that absorbs the light
[9:32] <Parthon> because the scattered sunlight filtering through the atmosphere is brighter than the light coming from stars
[9:32] <mail2345> from the stars
[9:32] <mail2345> see
[9:32] <Marach> then there was a problem... we didnt know how to wake up from it!
[9:32] <mail2345> the reason that doesn't happen in the night
[9:32] <mail2345> is that your mom's gavity
[9:32] <mail2345> is busy attracting lots of semen

[9:33] <DimJim> i'd find a combined lucid dream machine with a time stopper would be a very great invention
[9:34] <outsomnia> Your mom really does attract semen, but not enough for it to move anywhere significant.
[9:34] <outsomnia> Think about it for a moment.
[9:34] <Parthon> I think it's because the gravity needs to be high enough to contain enough oxygen in the atmosphere for animals to breathe, but not so high that they can't walk

[9:50] <sirzo> the spider
[9:50] <vurtual> it's a trick question
[9:50] <vurtual> pretty sure you could fire arrows before spiders
[9:50] <Silver_Shadow> I can actually answer the old chicken and egg question
[9:50] <vurtual> but that may or may not be a bow
[9:50] <vurtual> creationism says probably chicken
[9:50] <Rooster> Bow has nothing to do with Spiders
[9:50] <Silver_Shadow> Yeah
[9:50] <vurtual> evolution says egg, as the creature that was not a chicken, made egg, mild change BOOM chicken

[10:15] <vurtual> whoooops
[10:15] <AndrewPH> Bananabot's a logging bot stupid
[10:15] <vurtual> So my friend, just a kid, acted way unlike him
[10:15] <AndrewPH> Notice how the channel didn't tell you bananabot was loggin
[10:15] <AndrewPH> g
[10:16] <AndrewPH> it was bananabot who /notice'd you
[10:16] <vurtual> I thought his steam account might've been hacked
[10:16] <CruelNoise> i know, but it still says no bots.
[10:16] <vurtual> So I told him to join an IRC channel, pretty hard to find honestly
[10:16] <vurtual> CruelNoise, logging bots are pretty much ok here
[10:16] <CruelNoise> whatever, then
[10:16] <vurtual> anyways, so I had him join an IRC channel, which he had to remember
[10:16] <CruelNoise> vurtual, let me guess how it ends
[10:16] <AndrewPH> Logging bots are pretty much the same as somebody using their client to log and then having it upload.
[10:16] <CruelNoise> he was on crack?
[10:16] <CruelNoise> or at least high on dew
[10:17] <vurtual> He guessed the channel, then I used his time to see if he was in a proper timezone
[10:17] <vurtual> for a moment I mixed up AM/PM and nearly pretty much hit an ICBM button
[10:17] <vurtual> now I know how cold war officers felt
[10:17] <vurtual> cept instead of ICBMs it just sent lots of messages and stuff

[10:19] <Silver_Shadow> xD
[10:19] <vurtual> There's just no excuse for not knowing what icbm means.
[10:19] <CruelNoise> vurtual, i'm not a cold war junkie.
[10:19] <Silver_Shadow> The XYZ file format is a chemical file format.
[10:19] <vurtual> so firstly you missed out on the cold war
[10:19] <Silver_Shadow> XYZ is a hard rock band, formed in the late 1980s.
[10:19] <vurtual> then the whole WMD thing
[10:19] <vurtual> and then the whole nuclear decomission that happpened a week ago?

[10:21] <Silver_Shadow> idk...

[10:21] <Silver_Shadow> he likes cows?

[10:29] <CruelNoise> i got a brand new bike last weekend
[10:29] <CruelNoise> it's awesome.
[10:29] <vurtual> I went and rode my bike but then snaaaake
[10:29] <CruelNoise> i'm planning on riding it to school
[10:29] <vurtual> so i was liek turn around.
[10:30] <vurtual> wait what kind of bike
[10:30] <vurtual> a small one
[10:30] <CruelNoise> snake? run it over.
[10:30] <vurtual> or like, has shifters
[10:30] <CruelNoise> hybrid
[10:30] <vurtual> wait wait motorcycle
[10:30] <vurtual> not like, tubing-and-gearshifts
[10:30] <CruelNoise> um, three gears on the left, eight gears on the right
[10:30] <vurtual> okay good bike then
[10:30] <vurtual> I have a bike like that.
[10:30] <CruelNoise> front-end suspension
[10:30] <vurtual> even shifting all the way down is exhausting on grassy hills
[10:30] <CruelNoise> nice for dirt trails

[10:30] <vurtual> We had some gigantic 4-foot snake on this road once
[10:31] <vurtual> so my dad ran it over,t wice
[10:31] <CruelNoise> ooo.
[10:31] <CruelNoise> your father.
[10:31] <vurtual> never saw it
[10:31] <vurtual> my mom would freak out
[10:31] <vurtual> apparently
[10:31] <CruelNoise> my bike has skinny wheels, so riding off-road is a pain.
[10:31] <vurtual> just cause 2 makes me want to get a motorcycle
[10:32] <vurtual> at the same time just cause 2 is a game where slamming into something at high speed can be walked off
[10:32] <vurtual> then again I have slammed into things at high speed and walked off... hm
[10:32] <CruelNoise> heh.
[10:32] <vurtual> infact it seemed a bit jc2 like
[10:32] <vurtual> hit bike tire
[10:32] <vurtual> people are panicing
[10:32] <vurtual> I get up and then my bike's all knocked down and damaged, I appear unhurt
[10:33] <CruelNoise> i'm planning on getting a motorcycle license before a automobile license, if that's possible.

[10:34] <vurtual> choppers too
[10:34] <vurtual> it's ironic and backwards

[10:36] <CruelNoise> unfortunately, i have two watching a youtube comedian less than two metres away.
[10:36] <vurtual> teeheehee
[10:37] <vurtual> and choppers? I can land them really well
[10:37] <CruelNoise> i would love to fly a plane
[10:37] <vurtual> flying not so much
[10:37] <Silver_Shadow> When life gives you lemons
[10:37] <vurtual> simplified choppers I go anywhere from amazing mastery(jc2-style choppers I show lots of chopper-skills with if needed)
[10:37] <Silver_Shadow> BLOW THEM UP

[10:37] <vurtual> to not dying(ArmA)
[10:37] <vurtual> but real choppers I don't handle that well
[10:37] <vurtual> once I figure out balance I'll be fine though
[10:38] <CruelNoise> vurt, what time is it where you are?
[10:38] <vurtual> 1:38
[10:38] <vurtual> I need slee
[10:38] <vurtual> ctcp time
[10:38] <CruelNoise> damn, do you own a chopper or something?
[10:39] <vurtual> if you're asking for a free ride
[10:39] <vurtual> which will result in you tryign to fly
[10:39] <vurtual> generally that's only safe if the other guy is a really good pilot
[10:39] <Silver_Shadow> lol
[10:39] <Silver_Shadow> it'd 2:39 here
[10:39] <vurtual> It'd be like Harold and Kumar Medevac to White Castle, man.

[10:45] <Griskard> America, even though they had Nazi scientists working for them after the war at Area 51 on anti-gravity, didn't realize how advanced the Soviets had become with scalar technology until they found out they'd been secretly attacked during the 1950's undetected.
[10:45] <Griskard> ...
[10:46] <CruelNoise> scalar is like quantum

[10:46] <Griskard> By the 1950 the Soviets had developed time-reversed waves. They has also forced the captured Germans to build them a fleet of anti-grav saucers complete with particle beam and scalar beam weapons. In Antarctica the Nazis had Tesla's "Death Ray", capable of sending a lethal beam even to the moon to create an incandescent spot, when aimed at it. Tesla devastated with his "Death Ray" - likened...
[10:46] <Griskard> ...to a modern day particle beam weapon. According to Al Bielek the Russians have particle beam weapons which can shoot 1000 miles into space, and they use these to shoot down any UFO within 200 miles radius of their sky. The Americans also have many particle beam weapons and they too shoot down UFOs. There is apparently a war going on in space, and the Russians and Americans have secretly...
[10:46] <Griskard> ...got together to fight it. It is unknown who the UFO occupants are, but the Nazi's in Antarctica are said to be invincible with their superweapons.
[10:46] <Griskard> You know...

[12:01] <Griskard> Difference = -20; 43.5%

[13:55] <AndrewPH> except s and n generate floating tundra

[13:56] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Why all floating?
[13:56] <AndrewPH> on the edges
[13:56] <Vis{ROTR2010}> ah
[13:56] <AndrewPH> and right near the edge have hell
[13:56] <AndrewPH> and then have it get better as it goes in
[13:56] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I would like to keep hell in the middle of the inlands
[13:56] <AndrewPH> ie mountains before hell, forests, deserts, and then grasslands
[13:56] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and there should be possibilities of "cracks"
[13:56] <carlll> are there any maps to download infdev for?

[13:57] <Vis{ROTR2010}> only they're huuuuuge

[14:00] <AndrewPH> when you first hit polar it should be mostly just ice with a few cracks
[14:00] <Vis{ROTR2010}> or maybe a "default"

[14:39] <copyboy> imagine if offtopic wasn't allowed
[14:39] <Snowman> Well, maybe about other topics but not about a cube game
[14:39] <Superwafflez> The buggyness that is indev saving and loading.
[14:39] <Marach> now, i will post what i always to when someone says "lets discuss minecraft!"
[14:39] <copyboy> outsomnia: posting links to them is fine
[14:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I wish google chrome had better themes

[14:40] <outsomnia> talk about what about minecraft?
[14:40] <Marach> WAIT WTF
[14:40] <outsomnia> There's this much off-topic because we've already talked our fair shares about it.

[15:36] <Speljohan_> looks correct now
[15:36] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Speljohan_: You're coding this in java, right?
[15:36] <Speljohan_> compared with real smb :P

[15:37] <Snowman> IT'S 13:37!\

[15:37] <Vis{ROTR2010}> they need to mess up the vector points
[15:37] <Vis{ROTR2010}> so everything is misshapen
[15:37] <Vis{ROTR2010}> then add a huuge motion blur

[15:38] <Marach> thanks.
[15:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> this effect is lips

[15:38] <Speljohan_> that's the only disadvantage
[15:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I swear, white cap is amazing
[15:38] <Marach> nope 12
[15:38] <Speljohan_> which causes memory overhead
[15:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and you can mess with mIRC to accept it as a background
[15:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> or just get Chaos Crystal
[15:38] <Vis{ROTR2010}> that works too
[15:38] <Speljohan_> it is interpreted as 32 bit Marach
[15:38] <Speljohan_> that's the reason java uses so much memory
[15:38] <Speljohan_> lol
[15:38] <Marach> :/
[15:38] <Speljohan_> and why most people do bitshifting
[15:38] <Speljohan_> to preserve it
[15:39] <Speljohan_> afterall, you can store 8 different "states" in a byte
[15:39] <Speljohan_> :P
[15:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Is it really that hard to code a SMB clone? I mean, I'm not being insulting here, but it would take twenty five seconds in Game Maker...
[15:39] <Vis{ROTR2010}> So if you add a few hours of making it 3D in game maker
[15:39] <Marach> ?
[15:40] <Vis{ROTR2010}> All of your java work is wasted?
[15:40] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Hahaha
[15:40] <Speljohan_> game maker wouldn't teach me anything

[17:19] <LG_Legacy> Fair enough
[17:19] <Foshie> I mean, Russia and Poland doesn't exactly have the love relationship between each other and i wouldn't really trust another country for flying a president of my country or so
[17:19] <Marach> yeah... communism ended in '89

[17:26] <vurtual> :'(

[17:27] <Superwafflez> lol this is why the president and vice president of the US never fly on the same plane
[17:27] <vurtual> Like in the US, where there's the president and vice president, and the vice president does a little bit of stuff.
[17:28] <vurtual> Then when there's no president, the vice president can president for the rest of the term.
[17:28] <Foshie> Sadly the opposision of the current swedish goverment wasn't on that plane.. I would have celibrated then ..
[17:28] <vurtual> They have a system where you would have to kill every last person in the government for there to be no president
[17:28] <vurtual> Though eventually the jobs would just be too much for one person

[17:31] <Ausfriend> like, build your base to your liking
[17:31] <Ausfriend> then destroy other forts
[17:31] <Ausfriend> or whatever
[17:31] <Ausfriend> last fort standing wins
[17:31] <Superwafflez> hmm

[17:36] <Macha_theCat> gotta play creative now
[17:39] <Serow> ...Vikings sailing on water under the sea. Spongebob is... Odd.
[17:39] <vurtual> imagine a game a bit like total annihilation, as in you have two bases. But you're soldiers, and it's JC2, and your job is to fight off the other side, and destroy the enemy base.
[17:39] <vurtual> Serow, as in a sea underwater?

[17:39] <vurtual> Those exist.
[17:40] <Serow> Also, vurtual, check out Savage: The Battle for Newerth. It's an RTS/FPS
[17:40] <vurtual> They look like running streams of thick, smoky water in the sea; they're actually some other liquid, and can leave you bright red if you went diving in them. Do not make skin contact.
[17:41] <vurtual> It's like you're swimming in nothing-fog, then boom, strange undersea world.
[17:41] <vurtual> Also, sometimes people think it's solid ground, so divers used to it will mess with people that way.

[17:45] <Ten_Tacles> Why can't you define burrows for pets?
[17:45] <Ten_Tacles> That would be helpful and stoping them from walking stupidly around!
[17:45] <Marach> #define burrow pet
[17:45] <Serow> I've found that I don't tend to travel very far in Infinite mode, simply because the areas I start in tend to be pretty awesome...
[17:45] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[17:45] <Ten_Tacles> Me too.
[17:46] <vurtual> I know no RTS/FPS will potentially fit the awesomeness requirement of my idea.
[17:46] <Marach> vurtual: make it yourself?
[17:46] <vurtual> If I could mod like that JC2 I would.
[17:46] <vurtual> Welp that came out... German.
[17:46] <Serow> Savage was pretty freaking cool. Plus you could have 128 people playing on each team. Some of those games got insane.
[17:47] <vurtual> Also I am incredibly elitist when it comes to games, and rarely go out of my way to try games that will suck.
[17:47] <Marach> savage? sounds like a graphics card
[17:47] <Serow> Savage: The Battle for Newerth.
[17:47] <vurtual> Generally I get more than my daily requirement of horrible, horrible games from all the gifts I get.
[17:48] <vurtual> You guys know Darkstar, right?
[17:48] <Ten_Tacles> Huh?
[17:48] <Ten_Tacles> Lol.
[17:48] <Marach> no
[17:48] <Marach> vurtual: ask for monies
[17:49] <vurtual> I'm not poor that's for sure.
[17:49] <Marach> something > nothing
[17:49] <vurtual> Anyways, Darkstar makes games ranging from mediocre, to absolutely sickening.
[17:50] <vurtual> They made some WWII "dogfighting" game which was plagued by very little to do, and the entire control scheme partially ruining the dogfight aspect.
[17:50] <vurtual> Then some ATVing game that was riding around in identical ATVs, failin to keep up, and trying to stay on the track so you don't hit an indestructible sprite-bush
[17:50] <Marach> i have to play la mulana. i heard it's good
[17:50] <vurtual> And those are just the two I opened.
[17:51] <vurtual> Infact if I could return some of these games I could get a new computer.
[17:51] <vurtual> Assuming they're actually 50 dollars which is a bit unbelievable, but who knows.

[17:53] <vurtual> and the game with the most "psychic" references: Pokemon puzzle league
[17:53] <vurtual> actually no pokemon gold
[17:53] <Marach> vurtual: you clearly didnt play psychonauts.
[17:53] <vurtual> my mom claims that this household will not let pokemon exist
[17:54] <vurtual> well, pokemon=bad

[18:35] <vurtual> How are you gonna run portal?
[18:35] <Cheeseyx> It lags to much
[18:35] <vurtual> Portal's a shooter!
[18:35] <Marach> vurtual: yeah it isnt hard, even for me
[18:35] <vurtual> It's the SAME ENGINE as all the other orange box games!
[18:35] <Marach> Cheeseyx: even with lowest settings?
[18:35] <Cheeseyx> Portal doesn't have a billion people shooting at yo
[18:35] <Marach> Source games run on everything
[18:35] <vurtual> ...and?
[18:35] <vurtual> It has turrets
[18:35] <Cheeseyx> I haven't tried other shooters
[18:35] <vurtual> a few NPCs has never lagged
[18:35] <Cheeseyx> Turrets aren't people who shoot at you
[18:36] <vurtual> They are.
[18:36] <Marach> Portal is much more laggy than HL2
[18:36] <vurtual> Functionally, they are.
[18:36] <Cheeseyx> And make you jump a foot

[18:36] <vurtual> They're programmed like people who shoot at you
[18:36] <Marach> mainly because of extended physics and rendering
[18:36] <vurtual> they render bullets, sounds, AI
[18:36] <Cheeseyx> Yeah
[18:36] <Cheeseyx> But they don't move
[18:36] <Marach> they do
[18:36] <Cheeseyx> And you don't shoot them
[18:36] <Marach> once pushed.
[18:36] <vurtual> You do shoot them, with portals

[18:37] <vurtual> in order to do some of the later puzzles in portal you have to twitch
[18:37] <vurtual> aaaahahahahha
[18:37] <Marach> Cheeseyx: i dont believe you can run portal but cant run hl2. portal has bigger requirements

[18:39] <Marach> also, DO TAKE the D.O.G.'s ball with yourself
[18:39] <vurtual> they generally quit early on because of the canals

[18:40] <vurtual> go forth and frag
[18:41] <vurtual> It's skill balanced a bit lower than you in the training, so you can't just fail.
[18:41] <Marach> or alternatively got get ut2004 from gog.
[18:41] <vurtual> no
[18:41] <vurtual> quake
[18:41] <Marach> go*
[18:41] <vurtual> Quake is legendary sir.
[18:41] <vurtual> ut is lame compared to it
[18:41] <Cheeseyx> What is Quake?
[18:41] <Marach> respected != good
[18:41] <vurtual> Cheeseyx, well back in the 80s
[18:41] <vurtual> id made doom
[18:41] <vurtual> then, later, they made quake
[18:41] <Marach> Cheeseyx: lets pretend you didnt just say that
[18:41] <Cheeseyx> Ah
[18:41] <vurtual> and it had ROCKET JUMPING
[18:41] <vurtual> and id saw that it was really good, so it became a legendary thing
[18:41] <Cheeseyx> Rocket Jumping?
[18:41] <Cheeseyx> SWEET
[18:42] <Marach> LIMITED rockets.
[18:42] <vurtual> up to 25
[18:42] <vurtual> until you find more
[18:42] <vurtual> and in maps like Forgotten Place(which is ftw), running out almost never happens
[18:42] <Marach> you mean q3.
[18:42] <Superwafflez> Quake Engine 3 is hilarious with its physics...
[18:42] <Superwafflez> strafe jumping!!!
[18:43] <Superwafflez> it lives on in modern warfare 2
[18:43] <vurtual> Superwafflez, all the quake engines had it a bit
[18:43] <vurtual> but q3 actually made it a feature, it was such liked by the community

[18:43] <Cheeseyx> I'll try Quake
[18:43] <Cheeseyx> Then run Garry's Mod

[18:44] <vurtual> except they did everything differently
[18:44] <Superwafflez> yeah
[18:44] <Marach> lol
[18:44] <Superwafflez> at its roots it is
[18:44] <Marach> same but with exceptions of the differences
[18:44] <vurtual> also 007: nightfire was on goldsrc
[18:45] <Superwafflez> Just how many games run completely new engines these days
[18:45] <Superwafflez> seems everythings just built on top of quake lol
[18:46] <Cheeseyx> On steam, it says that I have two things that have 1.1 days left on gift...
[18:47] <Superwafflez> Modern Warfare 2 weekend?
[18:47] <Cheeseyx> One is CoD Modern Warfare 2 Multiplayer, the other is R.U.S.E Beta
[18:47] <Marach> so?
[18:47] <Superwafflez> Yeah and both expire real soon.
[18:47] <Superwafflez> Every steam user has them
[18:47] <Cheeseyx> Ah
[18:47] <Superwafflez> once they expire you cant use them
[18:47] <Cheeseyx> lol
[18:47] <Cheeseyx> What is RUSE?

[18:49] <Superwafflez> RUSE looks like a WW2 RTS
[18:49] <Superwafflez> yeah?
[18:49] <vurtual> I keep mildly remembering it, but I don't actually know of it as any map
[18:49] <vurtual> They didn't just make it for the practice did they?
[18:49] * Varriount (mudkipz@pool-71-178-109-48.washdc.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[18:49] <Superwafflez> I think they did actually
[18:49] <Superwafflez> It feels like parts of all the maps slapped together
[18:50] <vurtual> Certainly looks different than any other, probably not balanced at all.
[18:51] <Keiya> Grand Theft Auto is SOOOO realistic!
[18:51] <Keiya> I mean, I land fighter jets on the Las Vegas strip, go into casinos, and *reliably* make hundreds of thousands of dollars gambling in real life, ALL THE TIME!
[18:51] <Superwafflez> umm
[18:51] <vurtual> Keiya, just cause 2 is more realistic
[18:51] <vurtual> I'm surfing on the jet
[18:51] <Superwafflez> The vehicle physics in gta4 are godly. That is all.
[18:51] <vurtual> Also it even simulates political unrest
[18:51] <vurtual> via water towers
[18:52] <vurtual> If I tried to port the training arena to quake 3, I'd probably end up getting lost halfway in and try to port maps from other games entirely
[18:52] <Superwafflez> haha
[18:52] <vurtual> Like... harvester from metroid prime hunters, that's probably based off of some other level in a game too.

[18:53] <vurtual> Always out of place though.
[18:55] <Superwafflez> I want a game where you play as Nazis.
[18:55] <Superwafflez> At the price of having it banned in germany.
[18:55] <vurtual> mod wolfenstein 3d so you fight many of the protaganists, as hitler machinegun guy
[18:55] <Superwafflez> hahaha
[18:55] <Superwafflez> I was thinking more of a call of duty game.
[18:55] <Superwafflez> The old cod
[18:56] <Codlike> Who now?
[18:56] <Superwafflez> Cod but you play as nazis
[18:56] <Superwafflez> epic win
[18:56] <vurtual> no wait mod goldeneye so you play as a guard without reloading
[18:56] <vurtual> and just a gun heat bar so you can't spray all he time
[18:56] <Superwafflez> lol
[18:56] <vurtual> and use german weapons

[19:29] <Marach> ...how the hell can i compare strings in java using boolean operators
[19:29] <vurtual> woah, it works
[19:29] <vurtual> at the same time, this is incredibly distracting

[19:29] <Ten_Tacles> Flying is about 10 times saver than driving with cars.
[19:29] <DimJim> W...what
[19:30] <Marach> vurtual: dig through settings if you havent already
[19:30] <vurtual> There's no way to make it "fullscreen" without actually turning on fullscreen
[19:30] <Ten_Tacles> But ships are still the safest option :D

[19:30] <vurtual> quake live
[19:30] <Marach> change the window size?
[19:31] <vurtual> I'm already firefox fullscreen, but the quake live actual window does not support going full-size

[19:33] <Marach> vurtual: there has to be a way to make it bigger
[19:34] <vurtual> This is what "windowed mode" is
[19:34] <vurtual> "bigger" is fullscreen
[19:34] <Marach> i dont get it
[19:34] <vurtual> Windowed mode is specifically the option to run visibly in the browser
[19:34] <vurtual> The other option is standard fullscreen
[19:34] <vurtual> There is not another button
[19:34] <Marach> run it fullscreen and hold the shortcut to grow the FOV of procaster
[19:35] <vurtual> running quake live fullscreen makes procaster unable to see it
[19:35] <vurtual> At all.
[19:35] <Marach> well, i tried it with croc 2.
[19:35] <vurtual> maybe if I had some quakelive-skinned q3, with the right balancing changes, I could just stream that.

[20:26] <Marach> SO?
[20:26] <DimJim> well then
[20:26] <T> Green at the moment, since you've talked within 10 minutes.
[20:26] <sllide> harr harr
[20:26] <T> The colors just show up in the nicklist.
[20:26] <sllide> i'm green ^_^
[20:26] <sllide> lemme guess orange is 10~30 minutes red past that
[20:27] <T> It goes Green -> Yellow -> Orange -> Red -> Dark Red
[20:27] <Marach> omg mibbit
[20:27] <DimJim> mabbort
[20:27] <Malikat> GREEN
[20:27] <Marach> die.
[20:27] <T> In 10 minute increments, I think.
[20:27] <CruelNoise> OMG i fukken hate this client.
[20:27] <Malikat> does the script track post times internally or does it idle ping
[20:27] <T> Internal.
[20:28] <T> It works seperately for each channel.
[20:28] <cal> idle ping would be too inefficient
[20:28] <cal> imagine pinging everyone, what a waste

[20:34] <DimJim> T: why
[20:34] <Silver_Shadow> what about it
[20:34] <T> The colors are different terrain types, and right now I'm trying to get it to make rivers.
[20:34] <DimJim> did you draw it
[20:34] <cal> lol draw it
[20:34] <T> No, it's based on noise maps for height and rainfall.
[20:35] <T> Python script.
[20:35] <DimJim> no i mean why did you draw that painting
[20:35] <T> I can't figure out why the rivers are only flowing northwest though.
[20:36] <T> I didn't draw it, it's output from a script.
[20:36] <cal> WHY WOULD YOU DRAW THAT
[20:36] <cal> WHY
[20:36] <T> The goal is to randomly generate maps.
[20:36] <DimJim> the painting of a horse attacking a football player was from a script?!?!
[20:36] <DimJim> my world is
[20:36] <DimJim> broken
[20:37] <T> I'm not talking to you anymore.
[20:37] <rainstormLagomorph> That fact that it's from a script makes it MORE IMPRESSIVE
[20:38] <T> He's making stuff up.
[20:38] <T> The image in question was this -> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2188428/river_output.png
[20:38] <rainstormLagomorph> Ah
[20:38] <T> The rivers are frustrating me.
[20:39] <rainstormLagomorph> I think I can see the horse and the football player...
[20:39] <rainstormLagomorph> Okay I've no idea what he was rambling about
[20:40] <cal> maybe he wwas referring to another picture
[20:40] <rainstormLagomorph> Still
[20:41] <T> Possibly! I don't see any though.
[20:41] <rainstormLagomorph> It is very impressive
[20:41] <Ten_Tacles> DAMN
[20:41] <Ten_Tacles> DAMN DWARF
[20:41] <T> Thank you. It's actually inspired by DF's terrain generation, although I'm doing rivers different.

[20:42] <cal> how is that atall related to what T is showing us

[21:15] <Silver_Shadow> silver bars a smaller currency
[21:15] <Mive> I really really hope we get some kind of currency
[21:15] <Silver_Shadow> and trading too
[21:16] <vurtual> use treelets as currency, maybe
[21:16] <LuciferZ> Iron is worth way more than gold
[21:16] <vurtual> or flowers!
[21:16] <Silver_Shadow> tI'd be content with trading

[21:16] <Tennist0> i'd rather just make friends with trusted crafters and straight up trade for exactly wht I need, not for gold which ill give to someone else
[21:17] <Kokopure> gold is really only useful for decoration in minecraft, isn't it......?
[21:17] <Silver_Shadow> yeah
[21:17] <Silver_Shadow> I'd trade
[21:17] <vurtual> like real gold
[21:17] <T> Well, if servers get large enough, currency will naturally form out of whatever is considered most valuable by the players.
[21:17] <Kokopure> Diamond would be more useful if I were going to trade something for it.
[21:17] <Silver_Shadow> There'd be like small stalls lining the streets
[21:17] <Kokopure> yeah
[21:17] <Kokopure> T, I agree
[21:17] <Silver_Shadow> and people could buy stuff
[21:17] <Kokopure> it should be left to the players to decide what things are worth
[21:17] <vurtual> you know in an ironic way, because of my snapping at runescape discussions here
[21:17] <Silver_Shadow> and there wares could be advertised using message blocks
[21:17] <Silver_Shadow> their*
[21:17] <vurtual> I always thought that incase of mass-inflation, you could use note-ified items as banknotes
[21:17] <Kokopure> well he's already got signs in developement, right?
[21:17] <Kokopure> I thought he mentioned that
[21:18] <Silver_Shadow> Nice
[21:18] <Silver_Shadow> That'd be awesome
[21:18] <Kokopure> under his public to-do list
[21:18] <Silver_Shadow> Where is that?
[21:18] <vurtual> we used to have storms
[21:18] <Silver_Shadow> i saw it once
[21:18] <Silver_Shadow> but i lost the linky
[21:18] <Silver_Shadow> weather would be epic
[21:18] <Kokopure> if you go in Minecraft and then click Developement Status up at the top
[21:18] <Kokopure> there's a link to it
[21:18] <Kokopure> http://www.toodledo.com/views/public.php?id=td4b49fbf9c05a0
[21:18] <Silver_Shadow> like, Hail
[21:19] <Silver_Shadow> thanks
[21:19] <Kokopure> that's Notches to-do list
[21:19] <Kokopure> haha
[21:19] <Silver_Shadow> could damage players
[21:19] <Kokopure> I have played too much pokemon
[21:19] <Kokopure> to think that Hail would not damage players
[21:19] <Silver_Shadow> and rain would help crops
[21:19] <Silver_Shadow> and hail could break glass and stuff
[21:19] <vurtual> weather has to be beautiful
[21:19] <Silver_Shadow> and kill crops
[21:19] <Kokopure> oof, I wouldn't like Hail breaking glass D:
[21:19] <Silver_Shadow> and sunny days help crops
[21:19] <Kokopure> that would discourage beautiful glass ceilings
[21:19] * Varriount_ (mudkipz@pool-71-178-109-48.washdc.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[21:19] <Silver_Shadow> but really sunny days can start fires
[21:19] <vurtual> rain should randomly create muddy ground
[21:19] <Silver_Shadow> yeah
[21:19] <Kokopure> oooh, mud blocks!
[21:20] <vurtual> which is like tilled wet ground, but not lowered
[21:20] <vurtual> and not tilled
[21:20] <Silver_Shadow> and maybe a thunderstorm
[21:20] <Kokopure> move through them the same speed as lava maybe?
[21:20] <Kokopure> sorry, just got caught up in the mud idea
[21:20] <Silver_Shadow> would be like hurting people
[21:20] <vurtual> Over time, water can build up ontop of the mud, and if surroundedb y similar water, will raise up
[21:20] <Silver_Shadow> and lightning starts fires
[21:20] <Silver_Shadow> and rain puts out fires

[21:20] <Silver_Shadow> I must suggest that to Notch
[21:20] <vurtual> or just make mud
[21:20] <vurtual> make rain-based farms
[21:20] <Kokopure> well on his to-do list
[21:20] <Kokopure> he says he wants to make Seasons
[21:20] <Kokopure> so I'm sure Weather is included in that
[21:21] <Silver_Shadow> ooh good idea
[21:21] <Kokopure> otherwise what would be different between seasons?
[21:21] <Silver_Shadow> summer crops would grow really fast
[21:21] <Kokopure> I'm sure he's got good ideas for that
[21:21] <Silver_Shadow> winter crops would die
[21:21] <Tennist0> no
[21:21] <Silver_Shadow> and players would lose health unless wearing armor
[21:21] <KodaichiZero> I just wonder what Notch is up to.
[21:21] <Silver_Shadow> b'c of cold
[21:21] <KodaichiZero> maybe he's playing DF right now
[21:21] <vurtual> Silver_Shadow
[21:21] <Silver_Shadow> damn I can't wait for multiplayer
[21:21] <vurtual> do you know how cold it has to be to hurt you, from the temperature
[21:21] <Tennist0> i would turn weather off if crops die in the winter
[21:21] <Silver_Shadow> ik
[21:21] <vurtual> like
[21:22] <DimJim> temperature would be a nice improvement
[21:22] <Kokopure> personally, one thing I really hope gets implemented in Minecraft eventually
[21:22] <Tennist0> that mean I have to start a farm all over again
[21:22] <vurtual> where lots of materials begin to freeze
[21:22] <Kokopure> is some sort of windowed overworld map
[21:22] <Kokopure> so I can tell where the hell my house is when I go exploring XD
[21:22] <DimJim> staying near torches and stuff or wearing leather armor would prevent temperature damage
[21:22] <vurtual> gasses in your body would have to instantly condense to actually hurt you
[21:22] <Silver_Shadow> I started another intresting conversation :D
[21:22] * laCour|ZzZ is now known as laCour
[21:22] <vurtual> infact, without chilling wind
[21:22] <Kokopure> I've lost my way at night enough that sometimes I have to actually build a new house.
[21:22] <vurtual> you could stand in extremely cold temperatures
[21:22] <Silver_Shadow> lol

[21:23] <DimJim> tips for surviving in minecraft: never live on a mountain
[21:23] <DimJim> people will see you
[21:23] <Kokopure> vurtual
[21:23] <vurtual> Lots of people irl can easily handle walking around in a tshirt and jeans, in below freezing, just fine.
[21:23] <Kokopure> I daresay Minecraft is only loosely based on reality
[21:23] <Tennist0> build an epic road like dudecon, then you'll never lose your home
[21:23] <Kokopure> since if you fell in Lava you would lie immediately
[21:23] <Kokopure> not run around on fire
[21:23] <vurtual> irl
[21:23] <Kizzi> XD
[21:23] <vurtual> you'd just be on a burning hot surface
[21:23] <DimJim> still, temperature would be nice
[21:23] <vurtual> as magma is too thick for you to sink in
[21:23] * mguy247 (Mibbit@adsl-220-179-113.mob.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[21:23] <Kokopure> I dunno about temperature, DimJim
[21:23] <Marach> irl you would die even before seeing the lava
[21:23] <Kokopure> what would that effect besides crops?
[21:24] <vurtual> So your feet would catch on fire, and start burning up, and you'd get away safely
[21:24] <Kokopure> yeah, Marach, it would be too hot
[21:24] <Kokopure> you couldn't approach
[21:24] * mguy247 (Mibbit@adsl-220-179-113.mob.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

[21:24] <DimJim> so if you wore like
[21:24] <Kokopure> going near lava would be like stepping into an oven
[21:24] <DimJim> tungsten boots
[21:24] <DimJim> you could walk around on lava
[21:24] <Kokopure> oooooh!
[21:24] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.56.234) has joined #minecraft
[21:24] <vurtual> if, and only if, magma were to suddenly occour on a floor, a really capible person could walk accross it for a moment without dying, wearing tennis shoes
[21:24] <Kokopure> I like the idea of lava-proof armor!
[21:24] <vurtual> the shoes would be on fire probably
[21:24] <Kokopure> I also like the idea of crafting a glass helmet

[21:24] <Kokopure> to allow you to breathe for longer underwater
[21:24] <DimJim> tungsten has one of the hightest melting points of all metals
[21:24] <Kokopure> what do you think of that
[21:25] <DimJim> would it break easily
[21:25] <Kokopure> hrm
[21:25] <Kokopure> well you would think it would count as armor
[21:25] <Kokopure> it'd probably have the same durability as iron?
[21:25] <Kokopure> since I think Fish are on the agenda
[21:25] <Kokopure> the seas won't be empty forever
[21:25] <Kokopure> there will probably be enemies eventually
[21:25] <Silver_Shadow> Fish would be awesome
[21:25] <DimJim> caaaarp
[21:25] <Kokopure> I mean
[21:25] <Kokopure> when I play infdev
[21:25] <Kokopure> and I hop into those cold dark waters
[21:26] <Kokopure> I get spooked
[21:26] <DimJim> i'd love to see notch and the df crew work on a df modification
[21:26] <Kokopure> I do not want to be in there
[21:26] <Kokopure> I think that fear should be legitimate XD
[21:26] <vurtual> why would WEARING A HELMET let you breathe for longer?
[21:26] <Kokopure> well vurtual
[21:26] <vurtual> Sure, there's air inside said helmet
[21:26] <DimJim> because it's minecraft
[21:26] <Kokopure> it'd be like one of those glass things
[21:26] <DimJim> or maybe you could have like
[21:26] <DimJim> a plant in it
[21:26] * Varriount (mudkipz@pool-71-178-109-48.washdc.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft

[21:26] <vurtual> DimJim, there's no df crew
[21:26] <vurtual> just one guy
[21:26] <Kokopure> haha
[21:26] <Kokopure> glass and a plant = BREATHE UNDERWATER
[21:26] <vurtual> exactly, one guy.
[21:26] <Kokopure> sounds like minecraft :D
[21:26] <vurtual> who works daily

[21:27] <Kokopure> http://www.divingmuseum.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/product_images/icebuckethelmet.jpg <--- basically I was thinking of something sort of along these lines, vurtual

[21:28] <Kokopure> I know you'd have a hose in real life, but I don't think Minecraft'd be concerned with such things
[21:28] <Silver_Shadow> yeah
[21:28] <Silver_Shadow> Infinite water would be cool
[21:28] <vurtual> a hose would be nice
[21:28] <Silver_Shadow> cause we could have water towers
[21:28] <vurtual> T, adventure mode.
[21:28] <Silver_Shadow> and pipes running underground
[21:28] <Kokopure> ooh!
[21:28] <Kokopure> do you think you could find sponges underwater??
[21:28] <Kokopure> like, as animals?
[21:28] <Silver_Shadow> good idea!!
[21:28] <Kokopure> they could be lurking around the seabed!
[21:28] <DimJim> so the df guy and notch working together to make a df mod for minecraft
[21:28] <Kokopure> sort of like
[21:28] <Kokopure> the pigs of the sea
[21:28] <Silver_Shadow> :D
[21:28] <Drewseph> OMFG
[21:28] <Kokopure> XD
[21:28] <DimJim> would be totally awesome
[21:29] <Kokopure> is that a good idea??
[21:29] <Drewseph> Coral reef and fish should be made
[21:29] <DimJim> that would be humorous
[21:29] <Kokopure> ooooh
[21:29] <vurtual> tarn adams/toady one, DimJim.
[21:29] <Kokopure> Coral would be a great building material
[21:29] <DimJim> make it so the sponges can transport water?
[21:29] <Silver_Shadow> yeah
[21:29] <Kokopure> haha
[21:29] <vurtual> DF and minecraft are coded in different languages entirely
[21:29] <Kokopure> that would be a very different use of sponges
[21:29] <T> vurtual: Yeah but that's not 3D.
[21:29] <Kokopure> but I like
[21:29] <DimJim> you could make coral out of fish bones?
[21:29] <Kokopure> two sorts of sponges, dry and wet
[21:29] <vurtual> T, adventure mode+visualizer
[21:29] <DimJim> and it could be an extremely strong building material
[21:29] <Kokopure> wet can be wrung for water
[21:29] <T> That's really hacky and still not a proper first person walk through.
[21:30] <Kokopure> I like where this is going :D
[21:30] <Kokopure> I may actually suggest to notch the idea of sponges as "pigs of the sea" XD
[21:30] <Kokopure> it'd be a good way to get sponges into survival anyway
[21:31] <T> I think a bucket would be more intuitive.
[21:31] <T> Since logically 1 block of sponge would only hold 1 block of water.
[21:31] <vurtual> we must use waffles
[21:31] <vurtual> to absorb water
[21:31] <vurtual> T, not really
[21:31] <Kokopure> well, T
[21:31] <Kokopure> that is logically correct
[21:31] <vurtual> you could fit a huge amount in 1m^3 water
[21:31] <T> Anything more imples the water is being compressed into a small space.
[21:31] <Kokopure> but wouldn't a bucket with only one block of room
[21:32] <Kokopure> also only hold one block of water?
[21:32] <Silver_Shadow> LOL guess what
[21:32] <vurtual> T, that's how sponges wooork
[21:32] <Silver_Shadow> I'm a op on a server
[21:32] <Silver_Shadow> and I have the wompenis
[21:32] <Silver_Shadow> and i pressed k
[21:32] <Kokopure> I think T's point is that
[21:32] <T> Yeah, but a bucket would make more sense. It'd be immediately obvious that it holds one block.
[21:32] <Silver_Shadow> and made an adminium penis
[21:32] <vurtual> womrape
[21:32] <Kokopure> you can't hold more water in the sponge than the space that the sponge exists in
[21:32] <Kokopure> however, if sponges can be stacked
[21:32] <T> And you're meant to bucket-brigade to move water around.
[21:32] <vurtual> Kokopure, aaaactually
[21:32] <vurtual> pretty easy to do that
[21:33] <Kokopure> you can hold 1m3 of water in less than 1m3 of sponge?
[21:33] * DimJim is now known as DimJim|shower
[21:33] <vurtual> yes actually
[21:33] <Silver_Shadow> yep
[21:33] <Kokopure> that sounds physically impossible >_>
[21:33] <vurtual> it's called science
[21:33] <vurtual> Well, you know how balloons have lots of air in them
[21:33] <T> In Creative mode, sponges erase like... 5m^3 of water?
[21:33] <Kokopure> ... right, because the air is compressed
[21:33] <vurtual> and how if you get something soaking wet, you can squeeze a lage amount of awter out of it
[21:33] <Silver_Shadow> yeah
[21:33] <Kokopure> right, but vurtual
[21:33] * Joguba (chatzilla@75-134-155-183.dhcp.roch.mn.charter.com) has joined #minecraft
[21:33] <Kokopure> is water compressed in a sponge?
[21:34] <vurtual> imagine a spongey balloon
[21:34] <Kokopure> I don't think it is
[21:34] <vurtual> no it's stuck into the sponge

[21:34] <Kokopure> he already said he wants to make baloons I thought

[21:34] <Kokopure> yeah, T, that's what I think
[21:34] <LuciferZ> Sheep bladders
[21:34] <Kokopure> I don't think sponges can hold more water than the space they take up
[21:34] <Joguba> VARRIOUNT
[21:34] <T> They'd actually hold slightly less than the space they take up.
[21:35] <T> Since some of the space is taken up by the sponge itself.
[21:35] <T> But that can be glossed over.
[21:35] <Kokopure> right, right
[21:35] <Kokopure> haha
[21:35] <Kokopure> well, but T
[21:35] <Kokopure> if sponges could be stacked
[21:35] <Joguba> Varriount
[21:35] <Kokopure> couldn't you theoretically carry around 64 blocks of water with you?
[21:35] <T> It'd still be a 1:1 ratio, even if they were stacked.
[21:35] <T> Well, yeah, I suppose MC characters have hammerspace.

[23:23] <Chezhead> Floating islands could be bats or pandora-birds form AVATAR
[23:23] <DimJim> no.
[23:23] <Chezhead> Sand worms?

[23:24] <DimJim> i'd like to see a kind of creeper that only explodes on death

[23:24] <Cial> Antlions?
[23:24] <Chezhead> yeah

[23:24] <Cial> slow you down?
[23:24] <DimJim> make healing items useless for a few seconds

[23:25] <Vis{ROTR2010}> No antidotes either, that's too much work.
[23:25] <Chezhead> maybe more
[23:25] <DimJim> fire, but slower and longer

[23:25] <Chezhead> Yeah

[23:26] <DimJim> venom + soup = dubious soup?
[23:26] <Vis{ROTR2010}> nom nom nom
[23:26] <Chezhead> DEADLY soup
[23:26] <slowriot> venom + ??? = profit?
[23:26] <Vis{ROTR2010}> We should make a thread about this
[23:26] <Eagle> Delicious? Soup
[23:26] <vurtual> I have an idea
[23:26] <Chezhead> WHAT
[23:26] <DimJim> that way you could poison kings
[23:26] <vurtual> a monster that is a tentacle
[23:26] <Chezhead> Lava beasts
[23:26] <Chezhead> Yeah
[23:26] <vurtual> It waits in a cave
[23:26] <Chezhead> Like-Likes?
[23:26] <vurtual> then, shoots out far, grabs you
[23:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Ooh
[23:27] <Chezhead> Yeah, you can dodge, hit teh tenticele
[23:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> if he gits you
[23:27] <vurtual> then quickly pulls you in, screeching loudly constantly
[23:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> you have to hit him o.o
[23:27] <vurtual> "SCRREEEEEEEEEEEEEeeee..."
[23:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> as he tugs you in
[23:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> to break free
[23:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and not be gobbled
[23:27] <DimJim> he'd be in a body of water or something
[23:27] <Chezhead> Something that doesn't hurt you, but steals what you are holding and runs away
[23:27] <vurtual> just basically yanks you in instantly
[23:27] <DimJim> and drown you?
[23:27] <vurtual> no, caves
[23:27] * cal (cal@cpc3-aztw7-0-0-cust377.aztw.cable.virginmedia.com) has left #minecraft
[23:27] <DimJim> that would be cool but hard to program :|
[23:27] <vurtual> He just waits in a cave until you make lots of noise outside(you or any mob), then just zooms out, grabs you really quickly, then pulls you in
[23:28] <DimJim> well probably not hard
[23:28] <DimJim> just impractical
[23:28] <vurtual> It'd just be a mass that has other tentacles, and when it pulls you in its cave, it begins fondling you with tentacles that deal damage over time
[23:28] <Chezhead> Kelp at the bottom of water, some is regular, harmless, eatable, while others are SPAHS ready to drown you.
[23:28] <vurtual> freedom is near-impossible
[23:28] <DimJim> bramblefuck?
[23:28] <DimJim> yeah, it could be covered with spikes or something
[23:28] <vurtual> also it'd rip your armor away and would do things like grab creepers, which hurts it.
[23:28] <Chezhead> I still think a theif that steals what you are holding and runs would be awesome
[23:29] <Chezhead> It is just as fast as you, but can jump twice as high
[23:29] <DimJim> and would it be possible to sneak up on
[23:29] <Chezhead> Yeah
[23:29] <vurtual> with particles
[23:29] <Chezhead> It is 1x1 block so it can go into small spaces
[23:29] <vurtual> so if it takes damage, it bleeds purple or something
[23:29] <Chezhead> Like windows
[23:29] <Chezhead> Ninja Sheep?
[23:30] * Furyhunter (Furyhunter@cpe-70-112-108-97.austin.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[23:30] <vurtual> Then, if you deal enough damage, it begins to bleed out and more violently rape whatever its trying to attack
[23:30] <DimJim> Sheepers
[23:30] <vurtual> Maybe if it's dying it'll just throw you against the wall. Then, it empties out into lots of blood.
[23:30] <DimJim> They look like sheep but when you go to take their fur they start exploding
[23:30] <DimJim> So you know they're not just normal sheep they could oink
[23:30] <Chezhead> XD
[23:30] <vurtual> oh and a harmless looking enemy that just lightly grabs you and slowly holds onto you, that is an arm of the beast
[23:30] <Chezhead> And don't have crosseyes
[23:31] <vurtual> so you just walk up to this plant, which breaks apart and a tiny tentacle grabs you, appears to be an enemy
[23:31] <vurtual> if you don't geto ut of the way and get safe quietly, suddenly SCHREEEEEEEEEEE and boom, the big one's got you
[23:31] <Chezhead> I hope Notch is reading this

[23:31] <vurtual> Also, all the blobs will be connected to one massive boss monster with many big tentacles, and it eats you by drpoping you itno a massive pit of acid
[23:31] <vurtual> and it will eat anything
[23:32] <Chezhead> Chus!
[23:32] <vurtual> It just vocalizes by painfully deafening you with a massive screech
[23:32] <vurtual> a deep, low-pitch screech that can be heard for a mile
[23:32] <Chezhead> Something that makes you deaf for 5 minutes?
[23:32] <Chezhead> You can't hear?
[23:32] <vurtual> or move for a few seconds
[23:33] <vurtual> And the whole thing is basically a gigantic jar-shape

[23:33] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I think that falling should be like morrowind
[23:33] <DimJim> Sarlacc?
[23:33] <Vis{ROTR2010}> if you fall from x high
[23:34] <Vis{ROTR2010}> you land on the ground
[23:34] <vurtual> and the eyes are actually massive compound eyes bigger than a player, placed on opposite sides of the beast
[23:34] <Vis{ROTR2010}> and take a bit to get up
[23:34] <vurtual> and you can only see twitches of muscles as it observes
[23:34] <Chezhead> Sandtraps? Giant things that suck in the sands into a giant sandpit
[23:34] <Chezhead> Heard of antlions?
[23:34] <DimJim> It's nearly impossible to kill and if it steps on you you instantly die, no matter what armor you're wearing
[23:34] <vurtual> poor lazlo
[23:34] <Chezhead> The real antlions

[23:37] <Chezhead> You hop on it and it starts moving

[23:39] <vurtual> it doesn't even have a stomach

[23:39] <Chezhead> It's not shaped in any recognizable way, and is neutral, but when you mine into it, it starts writhing and a hole apears where you are
[23:39] <DimJim> it should have a pool of acid in the bottom

[23:48] <Dysgalt> I approve of those
[23:48] * SpyLevels (Mibbit@88.85.44.75) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

[23:49] <Quatroking> well they often dissolve at the sews
[23:49] <Quatroking> so you're fucked anyhoo
[23:49] <Cheeseyx> They only need to dissolve at the joints
[23:49] <vurtual> They have to just lose any wearability within moments
[23:49] <vurtual> not even holding up the cups type deal
[23:49] <DimJim> that's why you always wash clothes when you get them
[23:49] <Cheeseyx> LOL

[23:52] <vurtual> There's probably a whole breast-contorting fetish out there
[23:53] <vurtual> Where scientists have invented breast "implants" that make them more capible of returning to shape if say, contorted into letters using pulleys.
[23:53] <ZomBuster> did I hear breasts
[23:53] <vurtual> yes
[23:53] <vurtual> We're talking about disturbingly stretching breasts to the point that my chest hurts from thinking about it
[23:54] <ZomBuster> breast implants with silly putty

[23:56] <slowriot> like your ma
[23:56] <Cheeseyx> 3D glasses?
[23:56] <slowriot> also, braille refreshing displays fts
[23:56] <slowriot> *ftw
[23:56] <Quatroking> 3d glasses doesn't give the touch
[23:56] <vurtual> it's called a girlfriend with the right fetishes
[23:56] <ZomBuster> japan already has that

[23:56] <Cheeseyx> Or better yet- A redone Virtual Boy
[23:56] <vurtual> Japan has a fairly intelligent robot-thing now
[23:56] <ZomBuster> but trust me they made it
[23:56] <Quatroking> yeah well I'm pretty much fucked considering I'm at a school with only two girls
[23:56] <vurtual> that will complain about you pinchign them
[23:56] <ZomBuster> it's japan
[23:57] <vurtual> or will grab your arm and broknely say that they do not like you touching their breasts
[23:57] <vurtual> I wonder how intelligent it is
[23:57] <Quatroking> one is a lesbian emo kid without any friends and the other one is fat
[23:57] <vurtual> 1. Give them common interests
[23:57] <Cheeseyx> The trouble about finding a girl with the rigth fetishes is that they are usually ugly, far away from you, or the wrong age
[23:57] <vurtual> 2. Weight loss is easy
[23:57] <Quatroking> fat as in "oh my god I need food right now otherwise I can't walk any meter further OM NOM NOM"
[23:57] <vurtual> Inspire the spark of adventure and they won't go back
[23:57] <Quatroking> and then after that meter "MOAR FOOOOD"
[23:57] <vurtual> sounds like a condition
[23:57] <vurtual> caused by eating the wrong foods
[23:57] <Ten_Tacles> Raw adamantine! Praise the miners! :D
[23:58] <vurtual> needs more pizza and carbohydrates
[23:58] <Cheeseyx> Anti-nemia
[23:58] <Quatroking> so like, you need to avoid that girl with a distance of 5 meters or she'll swallow you
[23:58] <vurtual> no Ten_Tacles
[23:58] <vurtual> you are the demons
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> No?
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> Hm
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> Anyway
[23:58] <vurtual> and then Ten_Tacles made mysterious substance
[23:58] <Quatroking> NO VURTUAL. YOU ARE THE FAT.
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> Its 27th Malachicte, 3
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> :3
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> :D
[23:58] <vurtual> and then vurtual was wownerd
[23:58] <Quatroking> and then vurtual changed into butter.
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> First year, yeah

[23:59] <Ten_Tacles> ARGH YOU ARE RIGHT
[23:59] <Ten_Tacles> Anyway
[23:59] <vurtual> If I could just magically have one and then maaaybe not(maybe reassemble it?)
[23:59] <Cheeseyx> Quatro, I just installed that
[23:59] <vurtual> I would test it to see how it acts
[23:59] <vurtual> various robots
[23:59] <Quatroking> I'm installing right now
[23:59] <vurtual> just for boning, or maybe just the normal ones made by Japan
