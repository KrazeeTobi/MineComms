[0:07] <Zuriki> Siiseli has arse pains
[0:07] <Espiodude2|Sexy> lolz
[0:08] <bildramer> IQ=/=intelligence
[0:08] <Zuriki> The condition is called IRC.

[0:08] <Zoronian> I think I took mine off.
[0:08] <commandhat> That was Zoronian with the AJ, btw
[0:08] <mloc|Tired> I dont know if I have one...
[0:08] * Zuriki (Mibbit@5adb7ead.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:08] <commandhat> *autojion
[0:08] <Firgof_Umbra> I took all of mine off I mean wait what?
[0:08] <Siiseli> anyway, age often hasn't got much to do with being a kid, it's how you act
[0:08] <commandhat> **autojoin
[0:08] <commandhat> whatever
[0:08] <Zuriki> Genuine lols.
[0:08] <coolpilot> IQ + good upbringing + logic + intelegence + civility = maturity
[0:08] <Zoronian> I act older than I am...
[0:08] <coolpilot> as do I
[0:09] <Fleur> Zoronian: no you don
[0:09] <Zoronian> You don't know how old I am.
[0:09] <coolpilot> I do :P
[0:09] <Siiseli> though there is a definite correlation between the two
[0:09] <thechris> <Siiseli>: anyway, age often hasn't got much to do with being a kid, it's how you act +1
[0:09] <Espiodude2|Sexy> What does "Replace all public versions with indev/infdev" mean? :o
[0:09] <SuperLlama> back
[0:09] <SuperLlama> it means what it says
[0:09] <Zoronian> You don't know what I do in real life.
[0:09] <Fleur> if your 7 then maybe
[0:09] <Firgof_Umbra> I dunno about civility. Sometimes, things get all 'dry' and stuff if you take yourself too seriously.
[0:09] <SuperLlama> you live in real life
[0:09] <SuperLlama> unless zombie
[0:09] <commandhat> Zoronian: <Zoronian> I'd mail him my penis.
[0:09] <bildramer> Espiodude2: no more free stuff
[0:09] <bildramer> :P
[0:09] <Zoronian> This is the internet.

[0:09] <Yourself> civility's for chumps
[0:09] <bildramer> no, the internet
[0:09] <Fleur> :/
[0:09] <Zoronian> The internet gives me the right to act like I don't in real life.

[0:43] <Yourself> steam servers must be getting hammered
[0:43] <gdude2002|mobile> lol
[0:43] <Mopquill> Besides, that logic is the same reason there's ops.
[0:43] <Yourself> my download speed is all over the place
[0:43] <Mopquill> And it should be noted I never asked for it
[0:43] <Mopquill> so, calm down.
[0:44] <KodaichiZero> I say no drawing of a woman is complete with frustration about how large you should draw the breasts

[0:44] <gdude2002|mobile> lol
[0:45] <Icenisse> I've always wondered
[0:45] <Icenisse> why do you kick
[0:45] * KodaichiZero impersonated an OP and is going to get banned
[0:45] * Cat set mode -b on NoBalls
[0:45] <Icenisse> and ban while they are away?
[0:45] <Yourself> so add-on and authoring tools started updating
[0:45] <KodaichiZero> :/
[0:45] <gdude2002|mobile> so they can't rejoin quiickly
[0:45] <LG_Legacy> Well.
[0:45] <Yourself> now l4d2 itself is updating
[0:45] <Siiseli> Icenisse, it's easier on my client to first ban then kick
[0:45] <LG_Legacy> .He kind of did ask for it
[0:45] <Snowman> Cause you can't do a "traditional" ban on IRC
[0:45] <Icenisse> why not?
[0:45] <fenixfurion> kickban doesn't really work
[0:45] <Mopquill> Siiseli, what client do you have?
[0:45] <gdude2002|mobile> so they can't rejoin quiickly

[0:46] <gdude2002|mobile> lol
[0:46] <Siiseli> you do understand that using irssi means I know how to use irc clients better than most people?
[0:46] <Mopquill> I was just offering help, no need to condescend.
[0:46] <Snowman> And it's free

[0:47] <Yourself> because my brother will get the updates too
[0:47] <Icenisse> I use what works >_>
[0:47] <Snowman> Is there Snowchat?
[0:47] <gdude2002|mobile> I use mirc with nnscript usually
[0:47] <KodaichiZero> that means update time
[0:47] <Zaneo> i use chatzilla because it was the first thing i saw

[2:52] <CruelNoise> how in hell does a rat get to level fifty?
[2:52] <Darkebrz> ah oh
[2:52] <vurtual> Darkebrz it's actually an extra one.
[2:52] <KodaichiZero> lol
[2:53] <Darkebrz> hmm
[2:53] <vurtual> CruelNoise, because it's big.
[2:53] <vurtual> Also the devs suck
[2:53] <Darkebrz> Should I play Borderlands?
[2:53] <Visiiri> Is borderlands good?
[2:53] <CruelNoise> no, it's just a normal rat
[2:53] <KodaichiZero> I have a level 62 pet hamster
[2:53] <Darkebrz> Wait what game is CruelNoise talking about?
[2:53] <Darkebrz> Visiiri, I guess

[2:53] <Visiiri> Nah
[2:53] <Visiiri> not good enough then
[2:53] <MarkofBear> darkebrz lets play borderlands
[2:53] <vurtual> no borderlands=bad
[2:53] <Visiiri> I'm considering Crysis
[2:53] <Visiiri> But.. IDK.
[2:53] <vurtual> crysis is also lame
[2:53] <Darkebrz> It is a lot of fun
[2:53] <arxx> O hai
[2:53] <MarkofBear> it is :D
[2:53] <Darkebrz> MarkofBear, PS3 sorry
[2:53] <Visiiri> vurtual: What games are good?
[2:53] <vurtual> The advertisement was graphics that were good back then, which aged
[2:53] <MarkofBear> aaawh man
[2:53] <vurtual> then an overhyped basic concept
[2:54] <vurtual> Good games are the ones that you can mod.
[2:54] <MarkofBear> vurtual the ads were 100bazzillion guns and coop
[2:54] <Darkebrz> I like Borderlands because of all the weapons
[2:54] <Visiiri> I want Just Mass Cause Effect 2
[2:54] <Visiiri> I mean
[2:54] <Visiiri> Rico + Mass Effect 2
[2:54] <Darkebrz> But my only friend who has it
[2:54] <Darkebrz> Can't play it with me
[2:54] <Visiiri> + JC2 freeplay
[2:54] <vurtual> I have.. shockingly very few games that can't be modded.
[2:54] <Visiiri> == the greatest game possible
[2:54] <Darkebrz> Because I need to forward some fucking ports
[2:54] <vurtual> RapeLay's about it.
[2:54] <Visiiri> I<3PORTAL
[2:54] <CruelNoise> you actually have rapelay?
[2:54] <Visiiri> I need to make a companion cube siggy
[2:54] <vurtual> add me on steam
[2:54] <Darkebrz> And for whatever fucking reason my router (which is a very common router) doesn't have the correct passowrd
[2:54] <vurtual> I'll show you it too
[2:55] <Darkebrz> So I can't forward my ports
[2:55] <fenixfurion> reset it
[2:55] <Darkebrz> Or host a minecraft server
[2:55] <Visiiri> Darkebrz: Hahaha
[2:55] <Kokopure> sounds like you're outta luck there
[2:55] <Visiiri> I have the password
[2:55] * Kokopure :<
[2:55] <CruelNoise> vurtual, i can;t because i haven't purchased any games on steam
[2:55] <Darkebrz> Yeah but see it is technically my moms
[2:55] <Visiiri> my ports are forwarded
[2:55] <Visiiri> and I can't
[2:55] <fenixfurion> ah
[2:55] <CruelNoise> you'll have to add me
[2:55] <Darkebrz> And there is a WIP key on it
[2:55] <fenixfurion> maybe your mother changed it...?
[2:55] <Visiiri> If you use the BitTorrent port
[2:55] <Darkebrz> So I would have to reset it
[2:55] <vurtual> CruelNoise, download a demo.
[2:55] <Darkebrz> Reenter the WIP key
[2:55] <vurtual> or something
[2:55] <Visiiri> then uninstall bit torrent
[2:55] <vurtual> like the tiny quake 2 demo
[2:55] <Visiiri> it will work
[2:55] <CruelNoise> no, i have to purchase
[2:55] <KodaichiZero> One more question Visiiri, does the campaign take place after The Perish?
[2:55] <Darkebrz> Visiiri, that makes no sense
[2:55] <CruelNoise> like, spend money
[2:55] <Darkebrz> Then rewrite the WIP key and shit
[2:55] <Visiiri> KodaichiZero: No, after Dead Center
[2:55] <vurtual> demos work
[2:56] <Visiiri> You're in the car
[2:56] <vurtual> generally
[2:56] <KodaichiZero> oh okay
[2:56] <Visiiri> and you lower a bridge
[2:56] <Darkebrz> Visiiri, what router?
[2:56] <Visiiri> that's no spoiler though

[3:00] <Kokopure> Yourself, yeah, they pretty much are

[3:00] <vurtual> underd0g, first, take off your pants
[3:00] <vurtual> check to see wether you have something going out, or just a hole
[3:01] <Yourself> so why do you expect them to follow rules of stick figures?
[3:01] <vurtual> if you have something going out, massage it until it shots web
[3:01] <vurtual> done
[3:01] <Kokopure> ...
[3:01] <Yourself> he's kneeling
[3:01] <Kokopure> Yourself, I expect stick figures to follow the rules of stick figures.
[3:01] <Visiiri> http://www.visiiriwebz.com
[3:01] <Kokopure> because they're stick figures.

[3:01] <CruelNoise> but you own it?
[3:02] <Visiiri> Nope
[3:02] <Visiiri> M4CX2 is mine
[3:02] <Kokopure> stick figures have rules like "a crude drawing in two dimensions made up of a couple of points and lines"
[3:02] <CruelNoise> ,,,?
[3:02] <Visiiri> http://www.m4cx2.com
[3:02] <Kokopure> maybe circles if you're lucky
[3:02] <outsomnia|Clinton> And how are any of the one's we've mentioned so far breaking that rule?
[3:02] <Yourself> apparently stick figures can only have straight lines and anywhere these lines connect is assumed to be ajoint
[3:02] <Yourself> and circles
[3:02] <Kokopure> the heck?
[3:02] <vurtual> aaagh
[3:02] <Kokopure> okay now I'm confused
[3:02] <vurtual> why steam, are you stopping my downloads on me
[3:02] <Kokopure> do people like or dislike the freakin' constellations
[3:02] <Kokopure> tell me that much

[3:03] <outsomnia|Clinton> I am indifferent towards them-
[3:03] <outsomnia|Clinton> they are an interesting idea, but I do not see much of a point behind them.

[3:12] <Zaneo> stuff will save to the server when you leave
[3:12] <KodaichiZero> I think only the server will save
[3:13] <Zaneo> well it will always be saving
[3:13] <MrBohica> I'm more concerned about how magnets work, honestly.
[3:13] <Zaneo> as long as it's on
[3:13] <CruelNoise> ahh....
[3:13] <Kokopure> http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/1452/starsu.png <--- someone else made this one (there's already a constellation thread)
[3:13] <MarkofBear> will it have a monthly fee?
[3:14] <MarkofBear> i mean... the server must cost money
[3:14] <MarkofBear> and upgrades
[3:14] <Yourself> there is no "the server"
[3:14] <Yourself> it'll be like it is now where servers are privately run
[3:14] <Kokopure> you make your own server.
[3:14] <fenixfurion> there is "servers"
[3:14] <Kokopure> speaking of!

[3:14] <fenixfurion> forward yer ports
[3:14] <Yourself> i'm sure we'll get a lot of people trying to run servers on shitty hardware
[3:15] <Kokopure> my ports be forwarded
[3:15] <LG_Legacy> Forward em again
[3:15] <Yourself> only to find that any more than 2 people exploring unexplored regions bogs the system down to something unplayable
[3:15] <Kokopure> Yourself, I'd be more worried about shitty connections.

[3:15] <Zaneo> well i mean creative Mp works pretty well?
[3:15] <Kokopure> can you imagine trying to sync the data of 5+ people simultaneously exploring an infinite world?
[3:15] <Kokopure> I do not envy Notch.
[3:15] <Yourself> well you only send the data each player needs
[3:15] <MrBohica> Creative MP is in a confined area.
[3:16] <Yourself> no syncing is needed between them
[3:16] <Zaneo> to the best of my knowledge inf is actaully limited
[3:16] <MrBohica> Well of course, but it's -much- larger than a typical MP creative
[3:16] <Yourself> it is, but it's really really big
[3:16] <Zaneo> it's a ridiculously large limit albeit
[3:16] <MrBohica> Yup
[3:17] <UnknownX> Bigger than the Earth
[3:17] <exe-> you only need to sync int32 map generation seed.
[3:17] <MrBohica> But -not- in volume (yet)
[3:17] <KodaichiZero> I really hope that loading times don't ruin it
[3:17] <vurtual> I am now super-multitasking
[3:17] <KodaichiZero> My ping isn't too special.
[3:17] <Yourself> exe-, that's assuming that map generation is done locally
[3:17] <vurtual> I'm multitasking using multiple computers, some with multi-monitors.
[3:17] <Zaneo> which i said he wants to avoid
[3:17] <Zaneo> which i think he said
[3:18] <Yourself> the plan, as i understand it, is to have the server generate or load chunks much like the single player does now
[3:18] <Yourself> and then send those to the players that need them
[3:19] <Zaneo> Common tactic is the player just tells the server it's velocity, then sserver calulates where it will be and sends stuff back accordingly
[3:19] <KodaichiZero> it's good that the player only has to load what he's near
[3:19] <Zaneo> if you lag, server snaps you back to where you should be
[3:19] <MrBohica> more or less
[3:19] <KodaichiZero> but the server will experience MASSIVE strain
[3:19] <Zaneo> Not if he does a nice job cleaning up code

[3:21] <MrBohica> I'll be on the lookout for both?
[3:21] <Yourself> i don't think the connection speed will be as much of an issue as the time it takes to generate new chunks
[3:21] <MrBohica> Or just Notch :l
[3:21] <Yourself> if you gzip the chunks they'll be a few kb each

[3:42] <DimJim> would you like to hear it
[3:42] <Mith> Sure. :D
[3:43] <Snowman> I'm gonna hide in the shadows
[3:43] <Morkraw> i will build a castle and then ban everyone from my server
[3:43] <Zaneo> well when i played it was bill
[3:43] <Morkraw> because im a despotic tyrant
[3:43] <Snowman> Then strike when they least expect it
[3:43] <Zaneo> and my friend said bill died for him as well

[3:43] <Morkraw> banned like the cabbage salesman you are
[3:43] <Snowman> His corpse is in the generator room
[3:44] <DimJim> As you walk along the streets of your city you see a light coming from an alley. You draw your sword and approach it carefully.
[3:44] <DimJim> You turn a corner and find the source, a couple of torches in a small open area, where a man wearing a full set of diamond armor stands.
[3:44] <DimJim> He stares you down for a while before saying "Please don't kill me."

[3:47] <Morkraw> as in, gold coins
[3:47] <Eztuzt> Ech
[3:47] <Darkebrz> Morkraw, I agree with it completely
[3:48] <Darkebrz> Block of gold = 10 coins
[3:48] <Kokopure> Morkraw, I think if you can craft gold coins you should A) be able to craft the coins back into usable gold
[3:48] <Eztuzt> Only if they have a use, like NPC shops
[3:48] <Mith> I don't like currency like that in minecraft.
[3:48] <Kokopure> and B) also be able to make iron and diamond coins.

[3:48] <DimJim> :U
[3:48] <Mith> Me too, Zaneo.
[3:48] <Morkraw> i was meaning a currency that you just get rather than actually crafting it from gold
[3:48] <Yourself> <Eztuzt> Id rather a trade
[3:48] <Yourself> you mean barter
[3:48] <Darkebrz> DimJim, nobody knows you
[3:48] <Yourself> and bartering sucks
[3:48] <DimJim> and
[3:48] <Chompers> thats me doing the pink
[3:48] <Kokopure> I like bartering with coins as an option as to what you can barter :P
[3:48] <Darkebrz> 8D
[3:48] <Morkraw> although you COULD make it so that its crafted from gold
[3:48] <Chompers> good job blue
[3:48] <Kokopure> I see nothing wrong with coins
[3:48] <Eztuzt> Basically same thing
[3:48] <Eztuzt> Trading in general.
[3:48] <DimJim> everyone knows mr. t
[3:48] <Kokopure> so long as the game doesn't force us to use coins
[3:48] <NotEagle> "I'll give you 4 slabs of meat and an iron pickaxe if you give me that pig and your iron armor"
[3:48] <DimJim> so it'd be ironic somehow
[3:48] <Eztuzt> I dont liek taking sides :P

[3:50] <Eyran> I have a question regarding running a server for playing on computers all connected to the same router as the server. Anyone available to help?

[3:51] <Darkebrz> Making sure it has plentiful water and shit
[3:51] <coladash> hey iguana!
[3:51] <Iguana> I was supposed to be the only one that was ever trusted. D:
[3:51] <Eztuzt> First thing Ill try and do is find diamond
[3:51] <Yourself> i mean, there's a reason that modern economies don't run on barter systems
[3:51] <DimJim> http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/1369/soldieromy.png
[3:51] <Yourself> they're too primitive
[3:51] <Darkebrz> Anyways, I can't imagine any servers actually having infinite maps

[3:52] <Mith> But if we use coins, what else would they be good fo?
[3:52] <Eztuzt> Nopes
[3:52] <Bacu> no.
[3:52] <Eyran> I downloaded and setup the server software and am running it on my machine. I am thne able to locate it on the public servers and connect to it without issue from my machine. My friend who is connected to the same router as me, cannot connect, even when using the override link. Any suggestions?
[3:52] <Eztuzt> Nothing, really
[3:52] <Mith> Other than throwing at zombies.
[3:52] <Eztuzt> Coins would only be used for trasing
[3:52] <Yourself> <Mith> But if we use coins, what else would they be good fo?
[3:52] <Eztuzt> Other than that, they're useless
[3:52] <Darkebrz> Mith, does real currency have some use besides for trade?
[3:52] <Bacu> why would you trade with coins?
[3:52] <Eztuzt> Although.. it would be cool
[3:52] <DimJim> I think gold will have some sort of magic property
[3:53] <Eztuzt> If we could flip them and get a heads/tails 50% roll
[3:53] <Bacu> currency has arbitrary value.
[3:53] * Dudebro (Boschuh@99-6-225-96.lightspeed.rcsntx.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:53] <Zaneo> well you have to have a bank then
[3:53] <Yourself> the same reason you use currency in real life
[3:53] <Eztuzt> The only reason we use currency is because its representing something
[3:53] <Yourself> yeah, it represents value
[3:53] * MarkofBear (chatzilla@213-66-202-160-no30.tbcn.telia.com) has joined #minecraft
[3:53] <Eztuzt> Like, a dollar means you can turn in that dollar and get a certain amount of gold
[3:53] <Zaneo> because the paper money you have represents real worth that the country you live in is "holding onto for you"
[3:53] <Eztuzt> From Fort Knox
[3:53] <Mith> Although, as someone else said, being able to craft them back to gold would be good if gold had special properties.
[3:53] <Zaneo> a dollar bill is just a bank note that is an iou from the bank
[3:54] <Eztuzt> Gold should just be gold
[3:54] <Eztuzt> If we have a magic substance, I'd prefer something original
[3:54] <Eztuzt> Or rip microcline and stamp it with fairies
[3:54] <Zaneo> Let's trade mercury poisoning?
[3:54] <Mith> What else would we use gold for? Sofas?
[3:54] <Eztuzt> Yes.
[3:54] <Eztuzt> And pants
[3:54] <Mith> Sparkly sparkly.
[3:54] <Zaneo> Je mange le pantelon rouge.
[3:54] <Eztuzt> Alright, off the gold topic
[3:55] <Eztuzt> Red pants are nicew
[3:55] <Zaneo> I know right?
[3:55] <Eztuzt> But
[3:55] <Mith> I demand blue!
[3:55] <Eztuzt> Who thinks we should be able to craft metals into bars
[3:55] <Eztuzt> Like sticks, you put one over another and get 4 metal bars

[4:10] <vurtual> Would we have a hitler day where we pretend to really like hitler, just so that this supposedly immortal hitler would not kill us all?
[4:10] <Dysgalt> that reminds me
[4:10] <vurtual> Would Hiroshima and Nagasaki actually be bombed because they were his hiding places!?
[4:10] <Azathoth> then nagasaki was the result of a predator dieing

[4:14] <vurtual> It'd be like fighting the Strogg.
[4:14] <underd0g> Yet still we have North Korea

[4:15] <vurtual> So we just try to redirect him around by capturing him and dumping him in the ocean repeatedly or something
[4:15] <vurtual> Anyways, hawking was on the apollo missions ok.
[4:15] <AI> I think it would be wrong to assume that he was moral-less and heartless; Hitler just had a very different - and very wrong to us -
[4:15] <vurtual> As a kid, he encountered the first cyberhitler
[4:15] <AI> view of what was right
[4:15] <vurtual> Then was on the moon to see the hitlergundam
[4:15] <mcbackstory> Read The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, come back with insight

[4:16] <Classiest|AFK> Freak :D

[4:49] <KodaichiZero> id was kind of crappy, sure you could enchant all items with these stones that are really rare and all, but almost everything was overpowered
[4:49] <vurtual> I'd prefer a piece of paper that you can draw on

[4:49] <Trapiki> MarkofBear: Can it get my to my home base?

[5:32] <vurtual> Nor do they have the "I did it already once" confidence
[5:32] <AndrewPH> Zoronian, I think you should lurk for a while before trying to be me
[5:32] <vurtual> That's why beating a game you beat once is easy
[5:32] <Scy> but you still had to learn
[5:32] <vurtual> anyways no it isn't Vladivostok

[5:50] <jonnyabc> dunno
[5:50] <Koko|Mw2> thanks to the holy-shit-money-printing-iProducts

[5:57] <Uncreative_> but there's not enough flat areas..
[5:57] <ZarroTsu> what you do is make half-block windows, and fire arrows out them
[5:57] * Uniju (Noah@cpe-66-65-233-251.nycap.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: god be with you)
[5:57] <Yourself> hopefully he'll do more with the map generator
[5:57] <Meizlizard> The whole point is that you carve out the land
[5:57] <Uncreative_> Hell, even a large flat area on a hill/mountain would be cool
[5:57] <Meizlizard> if you need it
[5:57] <Yourself> so there's more macroscopic variation
[5:58] <Yourself> i want oceans
[5:58] <Meizlizard> I usually just make houses on stilts though
[5:58] <Uncreative_> I hate carving mountains though
[5:58] <Yourself> really fucking huge oceans
[5:58] <Uncreative_> It takes resources
[5:58] <Uncreative_> ...
[5:58] <ZarroTsu> I wonder when notch will add vertical half blocks, or half-block textures
[5:58] <Uncreative_> Oh wait
[5:58] <Uncreative_> I could steal the resources
[5:58] <Uncreative_> :D
[5:58] <paz> big oceans
[5:58] <paz> would be cool
[5:58] <Meizlizard> Well, kill enough griefers, collect enough sand
[5:58] <paz> so would simple little rafts made by attaching wood blocks
[5:58] <Uncreative_> deep oceans would be cool
[5:58] <paz> to get across them quicker
[5:58] <Meizlizard> make some TNT
[5:58] <ZarroTsu> because I would -like-, when making a castle, to have my outter wall have those little arrow slits vertically

[5:59] <Yourself> the only vehicles i'd actually want are boats
[6:00] <LuciferZ> I want carts. Pullable carts.
[6:00] <paz> yeah
[6:00] <Uncreative_> Vehicles probably wont appear either.
[6:00] <Uncreative_> Until dungeons and levers, anyways
[6:00] <paz> boats make the most sense
[6:00] <LuciferZ> Good for nomads.
[6:00] <Yourself> and that's only if there are big oceans to sail them in
[6:00] <Uncreative_> And even then, it'll probably not be a block
[6:00] <ZarroTsu> make a vehicle "hacker", and you can ride its back to go accross the map in an instant
[6:00] <Yourself> it definitely won't be a block
[6:00] <Uncreative_> It'd be more like
[6:00] <Uncreative_> a set of blocks you can make move
[6:00] <Yourself> it'd be an entity
[6:00] <Uncreative_> by pulling a lever or some crap lol
[6:00] <ZarroTsu> we can hold a hacker rodeo
[6:01] <Meizlizard> Well, TNT blocks move when you hit them
[6:01] <Yourself> probably a little row boat keel with a sail on top
[6:01] <ZarroTsu> and see who can hold on the longest while they triple jump
[6:01] <Meizlizard> I could see a boat move in the same way
[6:01] <Uncreative_> Nobody knows how the hell dungeons and levers will turn out though
[6:01] <Uncreative_> but that's because it's not in Alpha
[6:01] <LuciferZ> Or when the hell
[6:01] <Uncreative_> Which is why I'm excited for infdev finally coming to beta
[6:01] <Uncreative_> (soon, that is)
[6:02] <paz> what is dungeons and levers?
[6:02] <Uncreative_> ...
[6:02] <Uncreative_> o_o
[6:02] * Uncreative_ facepalms.
[6:02] <Chezhead> Paz, it's a planned modes with Dungons and Levers
[6:02] <Chezhead> mode*
[6:02] <paz> im out of the loop
[6:02] <paz> sorry
[6:02] <ZarroTsu> dungeons will probably come in pre-determined chunk formations (5x5x5), all of which will tile constantly in a snake-like formation, until the next snake direction is against itself
[6:02] <Chezhead> That's fine
[6:02] * ZarroTsu derf
[6:03] <Yourself> i thought the idea was to build dungeons
[6:03] <Yourself> like actually carve them out
[6:03] <Uncreative_> It is, I think
[6:03] <Uncreative_> Something about missions...
[6:03] <Uncreative_> or some crap.
[6:03] <ZarroTsu> basically when notch gets buildings in, I'd guess he'd use the same code only with rock for pre-rendered dungeons
[6:03] <ZarroTsu> or something
[6:04] <ZarroTsu> a dungeon is usually erected in memoration of something or someone
[6:04] <Uncreative_> o_o
[6:04] <ZarroTsu> be it a tomb or a pyramid, or a big 'ol ancient bank
[6:04] <Koko|Mw2> you know
[6:04] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat

[6:05] <ZarroTsu> there's need to be cacti blocks
[6:05] <paz> i love building huge pyramids
[6:05] <Uncreative_> PErsonally, I'd make MASSIVE puzzles..
[6:05] <paz> i should do a sphinx
[6:05] <ZarroTsu> and solid sand blocks

[6:05] <Koko|Mw2> sandstone would be nice
[6:05] <Koko|Mw2> would it just be found, or what?
[6:05] <Koko|Mw2> it'd just be the "stone" of deserts?
[6:05] <Uncreative_> what...
[6:05] <ZarroTsu> I'd guess 2x2 sand = sandstone?
[6:06] <ZarroTsu> well it could be the stoen of deserts for a while too
[6:06] <Koko|Mw2> I think a dark cream colored block would be neat
[6:06] <ZarroTsu> or somesuch
[6:06] <Yourself> sandstone shouldn't be craftable
[6:06] <Yourself> sand should be craftable from sandstone
[6:06] <ZarroTsu> what?
[6:06] <ZarroTsu> take sand, put it in a block, add water, blend, wait to dry
[6:06] <Uncreative_> holy crap
[6:06] <Uncreative_> this sun chips bag
[6:06] <Iguana> God night everyone.
[6:06] <Uncreative_> is loud as hell

[6:07] <Uncreative_> ...?
[6:07] * Uncreative_ just shook his head, apparently.
[6:07] <ZarroTsu> sandstone is essentially solid cement, using sand instead of gravel
[6:08] <primis> lol
[6:08] <Yourself> mixing water with sand and then letting it dry out will just leave you with the sand you started with
[6:08] <primis> it should be 4 sand + a rock

[6:09] <Uncreative_> o_o..
[6:09] <Uncreative_> I don't think notch wants to code in salt water
[6:09] <Uncreative_> or salt.

[6:10] <vurtual> sodium block
[6:10] <vurtual> in a thin, water-soluble case
[6:10] <vurtual> drop it into water like sand
[6:10] <Uncreative_> mix it with chlorine
[6:10] <vurtual> get explosion of tnt
[6:10] <Uncreative_> lol.
[6:10] <Uncreative_> why does sodium explode when it comes in contact with water, anyways
[6:10] <ZarroTsu> in direct counter arguement with "yourself": adding gunpowder to sand does not make red TNT-labeled casing
[6:11] <Yourself> i think that's stupid too, but we weren't talking about that
[6:11] <ZarroTsu> something about sodium being unstable @ uncreative
[6:12] <ZarroTsu> mostly that
[6:12] <Uncreative_> o_o....
[6:12] <Uncreative_> ok.

[6:13] <Uncreative_> o_o
[6:13] <Roujo|Away> Exactly
[6:13] <Roujo|Away> 2 Na + 2 H2O ? H2 + 2 Na+ + 2 OH?
[6:13] <Yourself> all alkali metals react in a similar fashion
[6:13] <Roujo|Away> Yeah
[6:13] * DatOneGuy (datoneguy@adsl-8-19-252.mia.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[6:14] <Uncreative_> ahh.
[6:14] <Roujo|Away> And the higher the period, the more intense the reaction
[6:14] <Roujo|Away> So they produce Hydrogen gas
[6:14] <Roujo|Away> + a lot of heat
[6:14] <Roujo|Away> So the Hydrogen ignites
[6:14] <Roujo|Away> And ASPLODES! =D
[6:14] <Yourself> which makes water
[6:14] <Yourself> and more heat
[6:14] <Roujo|Away> It doesn't make water
[6:14] <Yourself> burning hydrogen makes water
[6:15] <Konogan> Fake.
[6:15] <Roujo|Away> aH
[6:15] <Roujo|Away> Yeah
[6:15] <Roujo|Away> Sorry about that
[6:15] <AndrewPH> it makes things out of thin air mmk
[6:15] <Roujo|Away> I thought you meant the reaction made water, not the combustion
[6:15] <Yourself> AndrewPH, oxygen's got to come from somewhere
[6:15] <Roujo|Away> You are 100% right =)
[6:15] <AndrewPH> Yourself, it comes from my anus
[6:15] <ZarroTsu> does hydrogen naturally magically bond with oxygen?
[6:15] <Yourself> the combustion is a reaction
[6:15] <Yourself> not at room temperature
[6:16] <Roujo|Away> You have to put energy into the reaction for it to happen
[6:16] <Uncreative_> Andrew.
[6:16] <Roujo|Away> Basically, heat
[6:16] <Uncreative_> I want to see your anus.
[6:16] <LanternGhost> ..
[6:16] <LanternGhost> ok
[6:16] <Uncreative_> It sounds like a magical place.
[6:16] <LuciferZ> Whoa guys

[6:22] <LuciferZ> I have.
[6:22] <Kenshin> wat do u think of it
[6:22] <Yourself> no
[6:23] <LuciferZ> I think it's not going to be useful for a long time.
[6:23] <Kenshin> if u haven't heard of it, it's basically (allegedly) a different way to render stuff
[6:23] <Kenshin> if it's really i don't think it'll take that long
[6:23] <ClassiestMedic> Ja Wohl, Mein Krafters
[6:23] <ClassiestMedic> ^-^
[6:23] <Kenshin> if they can really whip out an sdk in 16 months and get some real support
[6:24] <Yourself> that's a pretty vague description
[6:24] <Kenshin> i'm not done
[6:24] <Kenshin> so basically all gpu's use polygons to render stuff
[6:24] <Kenshin> basically mad triangles
[6:24] <LuciferZ> Maybe. I just think it's too heavy for any large environments. Only some serious high end stuff could handle it.
[6:24] <Kenshin> this guy claims he's developed a way to render points
[6:24] <ClassiestMedic> oh god

[6:26] <Kenshin> meaning u don't even need a gpu

[6:27] <ClassiestMedic> YYou botched the transfer
[6:27] <ClassiestMedic> Badly
[6:27] <ZarroTsu> either way, go ahead and use the default .mine then
[6:27] <ZarroTsu> ah
[6:27] <vurtual> Turn up Just Cause 2 to a HIGH resolution on a small monitor, high dots per inch.
[6:27] <ClassiestMedic> My java was like
[6:27] <ClassiestMedic> on drugs
[6:27] <ClassiestMedic> then it died
[6:27] <vurtual> Then, any real graphics setting
[6:27] <Kenshin> and u'll see polygons
[6:27] <vurtual> See if you can make out "jaggies"
[6:27] <ZarroTsu> http://www.sendspace.com/file/fzusve
[6:27] <Kenshin> i'm not saying this guys telling the truth, but his ideas make a lot more sense
[6:27] <ClassiestMedic> SoundSystem shutting down...
[6:27] <Kenshin> assuming he's overcome the memory issues somehow
[6:27] <vurtual> he hasn't.
[6:28] <Kenshin> well he can render stuff for video
[6:28] <vurtual> Already on a low res, low settings, I can't make out "jaggies" or polygons in jc2
[6:28] <Kenshin> so i'd say he's gone pretty dam far
[6:28] <vurtual> Yeah probably took weeks
[6:28] <LuciferZ> Well the first problem is that it's crazy large.
[6:28] <vurtual> and was an animation
[6:28] <Yourself> this sounds like bullshit to me
[6:28] <Uncreative_> o_o
[6:28] <Kenshin> maybe
[6:28] <vurtual> Infact, low-res and highly polygonal graphics can look great if done well
[6:28] <vurtual> see: quake and quake 2.
[6:28] <Kenshin> i for one hope he's telling the truth
[6:28] <LuciferZ> I've never tried converting a map this big. BUT I SHALL TRY FOR YOU

[6:44] <LuciferZ> It was a dick move.
[6:44] <Dysgalt> :l vis your just butthurt

[6:46] <Darke> KodaichiZero, no

[6:54] <LG_Legacy> I'm always stuck with uh..
[6:54] <LG_Legacy> Mining God
[6:54] <LG_Legacy> We need diversity :<

[6:56] <PuyoDead> Yea, with us having old fart members like you around, we need more after 1500.
[6:57] <LG_Legacy> :P Exactly
[6:57] <vurtual> Have a milestone, then when someone reaches it
[6:57] <LG_Legacy> Que: PuyoDead getting pissed at me for this and giving me a "I'm Special" Avatar/Rank to annoy me
[6:57] <vurtual> the rank becomes them
[6:57] <LG_Legacy> The rank becomes them.
[6:58] <LG_Legacy> You become one with the rank?
[6:58] <PuyoDead> Ranks/titles are a lot different in phpbb, though.
[6:58] <vurtual> so if Bob reaches 2000 posts, rank text is "Bob".
[6:58] <vurtual> Subsequent ones are like "Bob II" and such
[6:58] * Titans (Mibbit@S0106002129b55e9f.su.shawcable.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[6:58] <PuyoDead> Before, we could just change anyone's at any time.
[6:58] <Chezhead> Yeah, do we get to change our rank titles after we get a certain amount of posts?
[6:58] <yoshibot> i'd play cortex command but </3 at autodeath in 6 minutes
[6:58] <PuyoDead> Nah, that's not in.
[6:58] <LG_Legacy> I've heard of some mods that allow you to change user titles, it really isn't that bad of an option PuyoDead
[6:59] <LG_Legacy> To have users edit their own titles
[6:59] <PuyoDead> I don't see a big issue with it, but I don't think all the admins/mods would go for it.
[6:59] * Animator (theysayima@adsl-144-247-182.mia.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[6:59] <LG_Legacy> If you think about it, whats the worst that could happen with it? They insert useless shit into it? Isn't that what it's for in the first place?
[6:59] <PuyoDead> Also, who slapped a @ on you?
[6:59] <LG_Legacy> Blame Siiseli
[6:59] <PuyoDead> Ahh, gotcha.
[7:00] <PuyoDead> Yea, if anyone doesn't anything stupid, we take it away. Fairly simple.
[7:00] <PuyoDead> It's stuff like that, that makes me wish we could invoke NeoGAF types of rules.
[7:00] <LG_Legacy> Of course. Ex: Racism/Sexism/Blah blah
[7:00] <vurtual> Put it at like, the next rank
[7:00] <Chezhead> I think you should have a certain amount of posts or something
[7:00] <vurtual> custom rank

[7:00] <PuyoDead> There's a community I'm in where 500 or more posts = you can change your title.
[7:00] <LG_Legacy> You know, sooner or later people will start asking for new profile fields PuyoDead like Minecraft UserName, and probably Karma.
[7:01] <Vis{AFK}> girls are in the kitsen
[7:01] <PuyoDead> There's already Minecraft username.

[7:40] <CruelNoise> thanks for the heads up.

[10:31] <dathimar911> Okay hmmm

[10:32] <WarCthulhu> What is this Rapelay I keep hearing about?
[10:32] <Speljohan_> dathimar911 i preferred morrowind and daggerfall
[10:32] <Bodie> they can ban what they like
[10:32] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:32] <Bodie> but i'll still kill them all
[10:32] <Speljohan_> i want something fresh though
[10:32] <AndrewPH> WarCthulhu, rape
[10:32] <AndrewPH> and lay
[10:32] <AndrewPH> rapelay
[10:32] <Bodie> i dont care about the raping, just the destroying
[10:32] <vurtual> first person adventure rape
[10:32] <dathimar911> I really hated Morrowind for one reason: combar.
[10:32] <dathimar911> Combat*
[10:32] <WarCthulhu> Oh, Hurr durr
[10:33] <Bodie> Gears of Rape
[10:33] <AndrewPH> dathimar911, that means you sucked at RPGs
[10:33] <dathimar911> The storyline was very impressive though.
[10:33] <Speljohan_> i can look beyond anything for the storyline tbh
[10:33] <vurtual> Just Rape
[10:33] <dathimar911> Although you could never hit a damn thing
[10:33] <WarCthulhu> QUAKE IT IS
[10:33] <AndrewPH> dathimar911, yes you could
[10:33] <vurtual> Rape Fantasy 7
[10:33] <dathimar911> The magic was pretty flawed too.
[10:33] <Bodie> i look beyond any story for the gameplay :P
[10:33] <AndrewPH> dathimar911, you had to actually train what you wanted to hit
[10:33] <dathimar911> But I liked the challenge of the quests.
[10:33] <AndrewPH> dathimar911, magic was fine you just sucked :v
[10:33] <Bodie> vurtual: i have no doubt thats a real game
[10:33] <Speljohan_> i still prefer classic d&d-styled games though
[10:33] <vurtual> Legend of Rape, Super Rape Bros.
[10:33] <Speljohan_> like baldur's gate
[10:33] <Speljohan_> and icewind dale
[10:33] <vurtual> Rape-dungeons & "dragons"
[10:34] <dathimar911> Has anyone ever heard of "Natural Selection"?

[11:09] <vurtual> Source mappers, for years, have made AMAZINGLY complex systems for elevators.
[11:09] <Subhazard> *raises his hand*
[11:09] <dathimar911> THE FUCK
[11:09] <Subhazard> I'm a source mapper.
[11:09] <vurtual> Now this quake 2 tutorial suggests that you essentially set up a system where you make buttons tell an elevator object to go to an xyz point
[11:09] <dathimar911> I am not a furry, good sir.
[11:09] <Subhazard> I'm making fun of a furry, good sir

[11:10] <dathimar911> Well I'm still not going to look at it, good sir.
[11:10] <vurtual> So you just make your little elevator, then a few buttons to go in it, the na few buttons outside
[11:10] <vurtual> Then, place four entities.
[11:10] <vurtual> Fully-functioning elevator
[11:10] <vurtual> Doors can be set up, too.
[11:10] <dathimar911> I source map on my spare time.
[11:11] <dathimar911> Elevators are simple, yes.
[11:11] <dathimar911> I make it so it's basically a door
[11:11] <dathimar911> That moves up and down.
[11:11] <vurtual> Multi-floor elevators
[11:11] <vurtual> with call buttons
[11:11] <dathimar911> Ah, those
[11:11] <dathimar911> Nodes and logic-thingies.
[11:11] <vurtual> a path_track that you use a button to make the func_train elevator go to
[11:11] <vurtual> 2 buttons, one inside one outside

[11:12] <vurtual> fully working elevator there
[11:12] <vurtual> Also I realised that if you used this apparent system, you could make a hub elevator system easily.
[11:12] <vurtual> especially with how quake 2 does maps
[11:13] <vurtual> Like, have each map of an area have an elevator, which also has a "hub" button, which goes to a hub floor, that can include going any direction or way, or even into a fancy sky-transport
[11:14] <vurtual> Then, the hub button takes you to another map, where you appear sitting in the elevator, parked. Then the buttons are relabelled for maps, and they make the elevator go down a track that warps you to the map

[11:22] <vurtual> Except maybe a mini-quest where you have to use a crane bucket system to move water from various tanks into another tank
[11:23] <vurtual> So like, it picks up maybe... liquid metal from a tank, draining the small tank halfway(so the bucket can't fill up anymore), then it has a star wars episode two style system where the bucket opens up on the bottom and lets it into the bigger bucket.
[11:24] <vurtual> Then, once you fill up the bigger bucket all the way, you can jump into an empty bucket infront of it, and a computer system moves them all forward to your goal.
[11:24] <vurtual> I could try making that maybe, hmm.

[11:30] <AndrewPH> horrible singers god
[11:30] <vurtual> Then if you hit the keyboard, it switches on a screen showing where the storage tanks are, and you can go to those areas to bring buckets to the big bucket line behind the screens.
[11:31] <vurtual> Then, once you do bring all the whatever number is needed, you can jump up into a bucket infront of the filled one(or die, jumping into the full one), then it goes forward to the metalcasting place.

[11:39] <vurtual> quake 2: rotated head edition
[11:40] <vurtual> Looks like you're desperately trying to look down sights
[11:40] <Speljohan_> very odd
[11:40] <Speljohan_> because
[11:40] <Speljohan_> quake 2 uses the md2 model format
[11:40] <vurtual> and that the entire map is tilted
[11:40] <Speljohan_> which is made for frame animations
[11:40] <Speljohan_> and not skeleton animations
[11:41] <vurtual> That's not relevant at all
[11:41] <Speljohan_> so either they have something implemented physically for heads
[11:41] <vurtual> This is the model itself being rotated
[11:41] <vurtual> and just my camera
[11:41] <Speljohan_> oh, so they have that added
[11:41] <vurtual> My head isn't bent around that I know of
[11:41] <Speljohan_> lol
[11:41] <vurtual> You can do it in source too
[11:41] <vurtual> have your camera be rotated all weirdly
[11:41] <vurtual> Anyways I made a guy who is rotated 45 degrees roll, so he sorta dies... floating angularly
[11:41] <Speljohan_> yeah but source uses skeleton models
[11:41] <Speljohan_> and physics
[11:41] <Speljohan_> so you can do more there
[11:41] <Speljohan_> with less work

[12:18] <Speljohan_> opengl is surprisingly simple

[12:25] <darkedone02> leaking poptarts.... the horseman of famine will not like that.
[12:26] <vurtual> or maybe someone leaking hiv's source, ruining pestilence
[12:26] <Speljohan_> tho rolf made me look inferior
[12:26] <Speljohan_> in a terrible way
[12:26] <Speljohan_> "O OK LOL WORK WITH GLSL SHADING"
[12:26] <vurtual> or leaking the source code of the atoms of kevlar.
[12:26] <vurtual> so war has a hard time
[12:27] <vurtual> or leak quake's released source before it's released or made, confusing id to no end but never hurting them.
[12:27] <Speljohan_> !
[12:27] <vurtual> Infact multiple half-life songs seem to sound like quake 2 songs
[12:27] <vurtual> One of the half-life stingers is actually the start of a quake 2 song.
[12:27] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:29] <Speljohan_> oh god i hate spotify ads
[12:29] <Speljohan_> "OMG HEAVIEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR, SLASH!!!213123"
[12:29] <Speljohan_> such a useless guitarist
[12:29] <Speljohan_> and bad song writer
[12:29] <Speljohan_> gtfo my spotify
[12:29] <Speljohan_> advertisements suck
[12:29] <vurtual> I wonder if anyone could bear watching me map for hours on end
[12:29] <Speljohan_> llol
[12:31] <Speljohan_> god i'm bored.
[12:31] <vurtual> watch me map for hours on end?
[12:31] <Speljohan_> not that bored
[12:31] <vurtual> You never know
[12:31] <Speljohan_> i do know lol
[12:32] <Speljohan_> i'd rather write some k0dez for new game

[12:34] <vurtual> http://www.livestream.com/vurtual It's there
[12:34] <Speljohan_> cant wait to get home
[12:34] <Speljohan_> watch moar star trek
[12:34] <Speljohan_> great way to motivate me to programming
[12:34] <Speljohan_> !
[12:35] <vurtual> Hmm, interesting concept
[12:40] <Parthon> Speljohan_: which star trek?
[12:41] <Speljohan_> voyager at the moment Parthon
[12:41] <Speljohan_> after voyager i have TOS and DS9 left
[12:45] <Parthon> awesome
[12:45] <Parthon> I like voyager, but tos and ds9 are better
[12:46] <Speljohan_> i've seen some ds9 episodes

[12:47] <Speljohan_> but i don't like it as much

[12:49] <vurtual> voy is awesome
[12:49] <vurtual> except the hillariously silly acting
[12:49] <Speljohan_> i love cheesy acting
[12:49] <vurtual> It was like watching TOS with a female Kirk
[12:49] <Speljohan_> hence why i love TOS
[12:49] <vurtual> especially the part where for some reason, the editors decided having a zoom in of Janeway staring at someone in the eyes all hyper, suddenly talking technobabble about fixing something, in the middle of a meeting, was a good idea.

[13:04] <vurtual> Beam me up, there's no intelligent user there.
[13:04] <Speljohan_> TOS is great
[13:05] <vurtual> This is even funnier that the enemies(3) are late game enemies, AND, if you don't find a(fairly obvious) secret, you have only(potentially damaged) health, and your starting blaster.
[13:06] <vurtual> On the other hand, 2 of them are melee attackers who go down easy enough, and there's just one projectile user, who will probably infight.

[13:12] <Azathoth> also vurtual, wtf are you talking about?
[13:12] <vurtual> the above video ^
[13:12] <Azathoth> are you making a singleplayer quake2 map?
[13:12] <vurtual> Yes I am.
[13:12] <Azathoth> i mean before the video
[13:12] <vurtual> Quake 2 was too easy, even on hard.
[13:12] <Azathoth> never played it
[13:12] <Speljohan_> wat
[13:13] <Speljohan_> how can you not have played quake2
[13:13] <Azathoth> *shrug*
[13:13] <Speljohan_> i remember when the demo was released
[13:13] <vurtual> I mean, I could've potentially beat it without any quad damages or invulnerables
[13:13] <Speljohan_> i was so excited
[13:13] <vurtual> They alone made the few hard points easy.
[13:13] <Azathoth> i wasn't a big FPS player back then
[13:13] <vurtual> I left many behind/wasted most
[13:13] <Speljohan_> i was big fps player back then Azathoth
[13:13] <Azathoth> yeah well
[13:13] <Speljohan_> now i am not
[13:13] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:13] <vurtual> So I'm going to make a nice little super hard quake
[13:13] <Azathoth> :P
[13:13] <vurtual> Normal will be like quake 2 hard I guess.
[13:14] <vurtual> Makron might be a recurring boss this time, and if I actually make this into a mod, he could have a load of health more each time.
[13:14] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:14] <Azathoth> also arcadey arena deathmatch games aren't really my thing
[13:15] <Speljohan_> q2 isnt arena at all Azathoth
[13:15] <Azathoth> but if the singleplayer is at least decent, it could be worth checking out
[13:15] <vurtual> quake 2 demo, now
[13:15] <vurtual> on steam
[13:15] <vurtual> 55mb
[13:15] <Azathoth> 55mb?!
[13:15] <vurtual> yes
[13:15] <Azathoth> that will take me like a whole fucking...
[13:15] <Azathoth> 2 minutes to download
[13:15] <Speljohan_> it's from like 1999 or sumshit
[13:15] <vurtual> gasp
[13:15] <Speljohan_> cant remember
[13:15] <vurtual> 1997
[13:15] <Speljohan_> o ye
[13:15] <vurtual> half-life came out in 1998, features part of a song
[13:15] <Speljohan_> i was 6 when i played it
[13:15] <vurtual> (as a stinger)
[13:15] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:15] <Azathoth> half-life was based on the quake 2 engine wasn't it?
[13:15] * SMU (chatzilla@77-233-84-160.cdma.dyn.kou.ee) has joined #minecraft
[13:16] <vurtual> half-life 2 episode one or two, not sure, has a song which is similar
[13:16] <Azathoth> or was it the quake 1 engine?
[13:16] <vurtual> half-life is quakeworld
[13:16] <Speljohan_> most fps's used the quake engine back then
[13:16] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:16] <vurtual> yet features SOME things frmo quake 2
[13:16] <Speljohan_> it was the most advanced one
[13:16] <Speljohan_> etc
[13:16] <vurtual> Most fpses still use the quake engine
[13:16] <vurtual> well, one of them
[13:16] * SMU is now known as haxelnut
[13:16] <Speljohan_> there's competition now tho vurtual
[13:16] <Speljohan_> ut engine, source engine
[13:16] <Speljohan_> etc
[13:16] <Speljohan_> ut engine is very popular
[13:16] <vurtual> Source is quake.
[13:16] <Speljohan_> really
[13:16] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:16] <Azathoth> hehe
[13:16] <haxelnut> well
[13:16] <Azathoth> basically
[13:16] <haxelnut> wow
[13:16] <vurtual> Just done differently, and few people actually want to use source.
[13:17] <haxelnut> your talking bout hl right?
[13:17] <vurtual> If they do make a decent game, valve will eat them up
[13:17] <Speljohan_> crytek engine is getting fairly popular now as well
[13:17] <vurtual> Yeah, but quake's always gonna be in the lead
[13:17] <Speljohan_> probably
[13:17] <vurtual> even mw2 was on it
[13:17] <Azathoth> i'm still a big fan of unreal 3
[13:17] <haxelnut> i just today bought half-life source, it rocks
[13:17] <Azathoth> the engine
[13:17] <Speljohan_> mw2 sucked tho
[13:17] <Speljohan_> !
[13:17] <vurtual> half-life source is horrible
[13:17] <vurtual> compared to half-life
[13:17] <haxelnut> no
[13:17] <haxelnut> its better
[13:17] <vurtual> Yes it is, relatively.
[13:17] <vurtual> The game's uglier
[13:17] <Azathoth> half-life source is alright
[13:17] <vurtual> You don't get half-life mods
[13:17] <Azathoth> for playing through half-life at least
[13:18] <outsomnia|McCain> lolsourcemods

[13:18] <Azathoth> mods are the reason half-life was so popular

[13:18] <haxelnut> lol?
[13:18] <Azathoth> omg sven co-op D:

[13:29] <Azathoth> i want to make a doom mod
[13:29] <Azathoth> seems like it would be easy to make the assets
[13:29] <vurtual> not really
[13:29] <Azathoth> since everything is just 2D sprites practically
[13:29] <vurtual> Even though id acts like it used to be, but now isn't
[13:29] <vurtual> it isn't easy
[13:30] <Azathoth> you're not easy
[13:30] <vurtual> since it's all low res versions of high quality fancy objects
[13:30] <vurtual> Would it be a sane idea to give the player a railgun early on?
[13:30] <vurtual> Like, as a sniper weapon.
[13:30] <Azathoth> no
[13:30] <vurtual> So they get like, 10 rounds, and then occasionally five more.
[13:30] <vurtual> But the weak infantry they face makes it useless for anything but sniping or boss-killing.

[13:33] <vurtual> 80 episodes
[13:34] <vurtual> Some short, some long.
[13:34] <Azathoth> :o
[13:34] <outsomnia|McCain> because everthing is better with the inclusion of multiplayer, even weapons.

[13:35] <pajlada> om nom
[13:35] <vurtual> There's 3 "chapters" though, the first is 73 and the second is the other is 5(endboss killing missions), plus 2 secret episodes, and then an extra hidden third for completing both secrets, containing another 20.
[13:36] <vurtual> Imagine the length of quake 2, just for killing a boss.
[13:37] <vurtual> The main antagonist, who, plot-ly, shows up very quickly in the background of it all unimportantly, being half-hinted by the whole game, then becomes a playing factor after a few missions.

[13:39] <vurtual> Then, after the main "goal" is over, you're thrown directly into a second final rush, to hunt him down. Going from faintly being pushed in his direction to cause trouble, to outright bringing him out and killing him.
[13:39] <Azathoth> is main boss bruce willis?
[13:39] <vurtual> it's a secret
[13:39] <Azathoth> because that's the only reason i'd play
[13:39] <Speljohan_> main boss should be tony blair
[13:40] <vurtual> it'll be multiple twists
[13:40] <Speljohan_> teamed up with george bush
[13:40] <Speljohan_> i still want a game where you play as terrorists attempting to destroy usa!
[13:40] <vurtual> finding out a big thing about him a few times, then a huge twist during his confrontation, that's only obvious afterwards.
[13:40] <Azathoth> it's you?
[13:41] <vurtual> you'll see
[13:41] <Azathoth> i think that would be really cool
[13:41] <Azathoth> to play a game where the main villain is actually you from the future/alternate reality
[13:41] <vurtual> By the end of all the game, the player will eventually be forced into combat with him enough, and hampered enough, that the player will actively hate him aggressively.
[13:41] <sppt> helo Speljohan_
[13:41] <Speljohan_> helo
[13:41] <Speljohan_> HAHA YOU DIDNT GET TO SEE CANDLEMASS OWNED FAGGOT
[13:41] <sppt> how r u
[13:41] <vurtual> Then, finding out who he really is will make you go "WOAH, THAT IS WHY XYZ" many times over, and then feel entirely different and sad at what you did.
[13:42] <Speljohan_> gud
[13:42] <sppt> ye but i got to see KYUSS
[13:42] <sppt> which is a rare opportunity!
[13:42] <Speljohan_> and u
[13:42] <sppt> im gud, we've got exam training bullshit nonsense
[13:42] <sppt> which is pretty much
[13:42] <mnjiman> sounds like an anime ending
[13:42] <sppt> go to school, make exams
[13:42] <Azathoth> :o
[13:42] <sppt> HURR DURR
[13:42] <vurtual> Then if you do both of the bonus episodes, which will give you certain opportunities, you'll get the extra 20 that involve restoring order.
[13:42] <sppt> done
[13:43] <vurtual> If you don't, you'll be left "a hero", and probably hating yourself for your actions.
[13:43] <Azathoth> "an hero"?
[13:43] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:43] <vurtual> You'll probably an hero
[13:43] <Speljohan_> being a hero sux
[13:43] <Speljohan_> cus you are in nearly all games
[13:43] <vurtual> btu everyone will be like "YOU DEFEATED XYZ, THIS IS THE ULTIMATE KILLING BLOW OR WHATEVER"
[13:43] <Speljohan_> should be a dirty terrorist instead
[13:44] <vurtual> While you, unable to respond, just sit there and feel sad.
[13:44] <vurtual> Eventually you'll probably have to leave.
[13:44] <Speljohan_> needs moar controversial games
[13:44] <Azathoth> it woudl be cool to play a game where you get railroaded into fucking shit up
[13:44] <Snowman> Manhunt gogogo
[13:44] <Speljohan_> i bet usa would ban a game despicting terrorist attacking usa
[13:44] <Snowman> Speljohan_, Red Alert 2
[13:44] <Speljohan_> ye but that is an alternate future Snowman
[13:44] <sppt> yeah there need to be more antihero games
[13:44] <Azathoth> like where, as the main plot, you're actually led to do something horribly evil
[13:44] <Snowman> It's an alternate past isn't it?
[13:45] <Azathoth> thinking that you're saving the world
[13:45] <Speljohan_> past*
[13:45] <Speljohan_> sorry
[13:45] <Speljohan_> however, putting it in modern perspective
[13:45] <Speljohan_> would be cool
[13:45] <Roadcrosser> back
[13:45] <Roadcrosser> SO GUYS
[13:45] <Roadcrosser> I LOVE YOU
[13:45] <vurtual> Azathoth, that's what I just made.
[13:45] <Speljohan_> an fps where you are an al qauida soldier
[13:45] <Speljohan_> during the war
[13:45] <Roadcrosser> hey, whistles are now jobs
[13:45] <Speljohan_> who plans a secret plot to bomb white house
[13:45] <vurtual> Yet everyone, except you, will think you're good
[13:45] <Azathoth> there are plenty of games where you play as a straight up bad guy (or can choose to)
[13:45] <Speljohan_> when you bomb it you win
[13:45] <haxelnut> my internet sucks
[13:45] <Roadcrosser> so when people blow them...
[13:45] <Speljohan_> not controversial enough tho Azathoth
[13:46] * Cat purr
[13:46] <sppt> yes but Azathoth a lot of these games where you can choose to be good or bad usually favor the good side
[13:46] <vurtual> It's like killing a nice man who this whole time was trying to stop some bad things, and was never trying to fight you.
[13:46] <Azathoth> not oblivion :D
[13:46] <sppt> oh you're so wrong
[13:46] <Azathoth> the dark brotherhood is the best part of oblivion
[13:46] <sppt> pretty much everyone hates you if you're bad
[13:46] <sppt> there aren't any towns consisting of mostly bad guys
[13:46] <sppt> which is stupid
[13:46] <vurtual> That's what a badguy is
[13:46] <Speljohan_> good/evil works best in mmorpgs

[13:47] <Snowman> Fuck it, I'll get a Snake avatar then
[13:47] <sppt> thieves guild is boring
[13:47] <Pumiotto> noooo
[13:47] <Azathoth> thieves guild is boring, imo, but the reward is great
[13:47] <sppt> it's like hurr durr fetch more gold

[13:47] <vurtual> Like if Red from The Shawshank Redemption was trying to stop you from destroying factories vital to an orphanage/stopping you from blowing up a planet's defenses that were holding back some monster thing
[13:48] <Pumiotto> oblivion is a great game, and dark brotherhood is quite fun. but its all the features together wich makes it so good :P
[13:48] <Azathoth> true
[13:48] <sppt> yeah
[13:48] <sppt> but
[13:48] <vurtual> But at first he doesn't know you're around, but he eventually tries to stop you from doing what you're doing, unable to inform you of your actions.
[13:48] <sppt> some features really need mods
[13:48] <Speljohan_> oblivion is too much easymode unless you mod it
[13:48] <sppt> such as the landscapes!
[13:48] <Azathoth> but the dark brotherhood quest line is better than any of the other guilds and the main story :P
[13:48] * O-van (Mibbit@82-198-201-242.briteline.de) has joined #minecraft
[13:48] <sppt> UL is great
[13:48] <vurtual> Then he has to fight you away, often doing self-endangering actions for no apparent reason
[13:48] <Pumiotto> yeah
[13:49] <sppt> stuff like that
[13:49] <Adura> Oblivion... I need that video where the guy is rotating into himself.
[13:49] * arxx (Mibbit@tabasalu-gw.radionet.ee) has joined #minecraft
[13:49] <vurtual> Then, boom, you kill him and find out what you just did.
[13:49] <Speljohan_> morrowind was far superior
[13:49] <Adura> That's a loltastic glitch.
[13:49] <Pumiotto> morrowind is a masterpiece
[13:49] <vurtual> THAT
[13:49] <Speljohan_> ^
[13:49] <vurtual> that is controversy
[13:49] <Pumiotto> but personally i like oblivion better
[13:49] <Speljohan_> i do not
[13:49] <sppt> wtf, according to steam, i'm downloading at 1.1mb/s
[13:49] <Azathoth> meh
[13:49] <Azathoth> i don't really like morrowind
[13:49] <sppt> yet i never go over 600 kbps
[13:50] <sppt> unless they are kind of upgrading already
[13:50] <vurtual> killing Morgan Freeman, who was risking himself to stop you from say, unleashing some sort of self-aware superweapon capible of annihilating everything.
[13:50] <Azathoth> well it's alright, but it's not that great. it's just too clunky
[13:50] <Speljohan_> at least vanilla morrowind provided challenge as opposed to vanilla oblivion
[13:50] <sppt> Azathoth, i prefer oblivion as well
[13:50] <yoshibot> you guys are either really late owls or in a different timezone
[13:50] <Pumiotto> ye
[13:50] <sppt> Speljohan_, the thing with ES games imo is
[13:50] <sppt> they're great
[13:50] <vurtual> 4:50
[13:50] <Azathoth> hoo hoo
[13:50] <Speljohan_> eu fags yoshibot
[13:50] <sppt> but without the mods
[13:50] <vurtual> yoshibot, 4:50
[13:50] <sppt> it would suck
[13:50] <vurtual> am
[13:50] <Speljohan_> 11am
[13:50] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:50] <Pumiotto> different timezone for me
[13:50] <yoshibot> so vurtual is insomniac like me then
[13:50] <Pumiotto> its 11:50 am here :D
[13:50] <Azathoth> 4:50 am
[13:51] <Speljohan_> nah sppt
[13:51] <yoshibot> so is Azathoth
[13:51] <Speljohan_> morrowind was great without mods
[13:51] <Speljohan_> oblivion was not
[13:51] <vurtual> just stays up
[13:51] <Pumiotto> yeah
[13:51] <yoshibot> forever
[13:51] <sppt> i don't really like morrowind
[13:51] <sppt> i dunno why
[13:51] <Pumiotto> thats true, thou i rly like the wide opportunity to download mods for oblivion
[13:51] <vurtual> Then you're like "oh no, I killed Morgan freeman.", and then you're like "Nooooo I'll be in an escape pod the whole time, and never get to stop the megaship from annihilating everythiiing."
[13:51] <sppt> perhaps a bit too dark/grim or something
[13:51] <Azathoth> maybe because it's more like wall of text: the game
[13:51] <Speljohan_> probably cus you came into the gaming market pretty late sppt
[13:51] <Pumiotto> you can make it a twice as big game with only downloading some mods :D
[13:51] <sppt> what, i played morrowind back in like 2002
[13:51] <Speljohan_> that's late
[13:51] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:51] <sppt> maybe 2003
[13:51] <sppt> iunno
[13:52] <Azathoth> morrowind feels empty
[13:52] <Speljohan_> i was around playing daggerfall etc
[13:52] <sppt> yeah well morrowind was released in 2001....
[13:52] <Speljohan_> uhh, and oblivion does not Azathoth ?
[13:52] <Azathoth> not like morrowind
[13:52] <Snowman> There
[13:52] <Snowman> Now I have a snake avatar
[13:52] <Speljohan_> morrowind was pretty damn packed with stuff
[13:52] <sppt> Speljohan_, i have never been able to finish morrowind
[13:52] <Speljohan_> lol sppt
[13:52] <Snowman> And Snake has a snowman avatar
[13:52] <Speljohan_> i have done it like 8 times
[13:52] <sppt> nerd....
[13:52] <sppt> l0l
[13:52] <vurtual> But if you complete both of the secret episodes you're like "Woah, wait a second, since I shut down the flight controller and blew up the extra defense systems, I can take a shuttle and fly straight to the megaship!"
[13:52] <Speljohan_> !
[13:53] <sppt> it's a good game, but something keeps me from finishing it
[13:53] <Azathoth> no one is even listening to you anymore, vurtual -_-
[13:53] <vurtual> also real men play daggerfall
[13:53] <Pumiotto> ive played oblivion over 600 hours gameplay >_< so i am the nerd here :P
[13:53] <vurtual> biggest map ever
[13:53] <Speljohan_> dagerfall is pro
[13:53] <sppt> perhaps it's just the gui that is cluttered as hell or soemthing
[13:53] <Speljohan_> except
[13:53] <sppt> Pumiotto, so have i, so have i
[13:53] <Speljohan_> bugs
[13:53] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:53] <Pumiotto> :D
[13:53] <sppt> especially with mods!
[13:53] <Speljohan_> i hated the modded ui for oblivion sppt
[13:53] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:53] <vurtual> Anyways I'm gonna go to bed and wait for this 250gb map thing to upload.
[13:53] <Pumiotto> i have it both to the computer and my xbox 360
[13:53] <Speljohan_> very much preferred original one
[13:53] <sppt> Pumiotto, you should check out the trailer for Nehrim
[13:53] <sppt> Speljohan_, there's several modded UIs...
[13:53] <Speljohan_> ye well the original felt best
[13:53] <sppt> i think the standard one is too big and shit
[13:54] <Speljohan_> i liked the size
[13:54] <Azathoth> you're too big and shit
[13:54] <sppt> i do not...
[13:54] <Speljohan_> yeah same Pumiotto
[13:54] <Speljohan_> well, pirated for xbox anyways
[13:54] <Azathoth> hurrdurr i'm cool because i pirate games
[13:54] <Bodie> damnit, i missed the 'thats what she said' opportunity
[13:54] <Speljohan_> u
[13:54] <Pumiotto> nehrim looks cool :O
[13:54] <Speljohan_> i did it because i wouldn't ever pay for a game on 2 platforms Azathoth
[13:54] <Pumiotto> but trailer is in german lol :P
[13:55] <Speljohan_> already have pc version purchased
[13:55] <sppt> yeah but they said they're gonna translate it in english as well
[13:55] <Pumiotto> looks amazing :)
[13:55] <sppt> but that mod looks so good
[13:55] <Pumiotto> is it out?
[13:55] <sppt> it's a total conversion so yeah i hope they'll release it soon
[13:55] <Speljohan_> fyi i am aganist most forms of piracy Azathoth
[13:55] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:55] <sppt> nah
[13:55] <Pumiotto> ok :(
[13:55] <Azathoth> ah man
[13:55] <Pumiotto> they announced to make a elderscrolls online
[13:55] <Azathoth> this mod does look good
[13:55] <Speljohan_> elderscrolls online will most likely suck
[13:55] <Speljohan_> ass
[13:55] <Bodie> so... it'll be like
[13:55] <Bodie> multiplayer oblivion?
[13:56] <Pumiotto> nop i dont think
[13:56] <Bodie> or... massively multiplayer oblivion?
[13:56] <Pumiotto> i think it will be all worlds in one
[13:56] <Speljohan_> it will suck because they will not make it a sandbox
[13:56] <Azathoth> ugh
[13:56] <Speljohan_> gameplay will differ so much from the single player game
[13:56] <Pumiotto> morrowind, daggerfall oblivion and such in sandbox :P
[13:56] <Azathoth> the mmo industry has gotten stale
[13:56] <sppt> they actually announced elder scrolls online, or is it still a rumor?
[13:56] <Speljohan_> cus no company is willing to risk money
[13:56] <Pumiotto> thats what i hope for
[13:56] <Speljohan_> it will probably just be a wow clone
[13:56] <Speljohan_> with oblivion theme
[13:56] <Pumiotto> i hope not
[13:56] <Azathoth> yep
[13:56] <Speljohan_> eg another questgrinder
[13:56] <Azathoth> another god damn wow clone
[13:56] <Pumiotto> WoW is so lame :/
[13:56] <Bodie> azahoth: agreed... wow is great... but literally nothing else has been worthwhile
[13:56] <Bodie> not in a long time
[13:56] <sppt> they had better release another SP ES
[13:56] <sppt> or i'll go mental
[13:56] <Speljohan_> wow is crap
[13:57] <Speljohan_> everquest was far superior
[13:57] <Azathoth> eh. i find wow pretty shitty too
[13:57] <Speljohan_> and even that was too restricted for my taste
[13:57] <Bodie> well fine i'll rephrase for you faggot
[13:57] <Bodie> I enjoyed wow

[13:57] <Pumiotto> i enjoyed WoW until first expansion
[13:57] <Pumiotto> anyone here got graphic enhancers for oblivion?
[13:57] <Bodie> i absolutely LOVED star wars galaxies before they patched it to shitness
[13:57] <Speljohan_> same Bodie
[13:57] <Bodie> it was so fun
[13:57] <Speljohan_> raph koster is mmorpg god
[13:57] <Speljohan_> best mmo designer in history
[13:57] <Bodie> you could be the most lowly nobody in the galaxy
[13:57] <Bodie> and i loved that
[13:57] <sppt> Pumiotto, QTP3
[13:58] <Pumiotto> ok
[13:58] <Speljohan_> mmorpgs were intended to be virtual worlds
[13:58] <Pumiotto> im actually looking for some really advanced enhancers :P
[13:58] <sppt> and some mod that adds 2048*2048 sized Distant LOD textures
[13:58] <sppt> hurrrr
[13:58] <Speljohan_> and ended up as grindfests to make money

[13:58] <sppt> check this out Pumiotto http://devnull.sweetdanger.net/obliviontextureoverhaul.html
[13:58] <Azathoth> yeah. mmorpgs basically turned into another competitive online game for teens with no lives
[13:58] <Speljohan_> yep Azathoth
[13:59] <Azathoth> persistant counter-strike
[13:59] <Speljohan_> thesedays it's all about "TEH STATS"
[13:59] <Speljohan_> and "TEH GEAR"
[13:59] <Pumiotto> cool! :o
[13:59] <Azathoth> seriously
[13:59] <Bodie> remember when even counter strike was only for nerds?
[13:59] <Bodie> those were the days
[13:59] <Speljohan_> it's all about numbers progressing
[13:59] <Azathoth> yeah. seriously
[13:59] <Speljohan_> a well designed mmorpg would hide all numbers
[13:59] <Azathoth> if blizzard games had colored cubes instead of models, people would still play them :\
[13:59] <Azathoth> because all they care about is the numbers
[13:59] <Speljohan_> and instead have player skills that determine for instance weapon accuracy
[13:59] <Pumiotto> im getting qtp3 now :P
[13:59] <Bodie> nah
[13:59] <Bodie> blizzard have amazing art
[13:59] <Speljohan_> nah
[13:59] <sppt> mind you, oblivion is using over 1 gig of texture memory here Pumiotto, and i think that's the reason why it's crashing for me
[13:59] <Parthon> I'm playing warcraft right now :P
[13:59] <Bodie> better than pretty much any other company
[14:00] <Speljohan_> blizzard is so damn stale with their art
[14:00] <sppt> Pumiotto, have you got a decent enough vcard?
[14:00] <Bodie> their artstyle is great
[14:00] <Speljohan_> they are making diablo 3 in same artstyle
[14:00] <Speljohan_> thus ruining it
[14:00] <Pumiotto> wow
[14:00] <Speljohan_> completely
[14:00] <Pumiotto> 2 gb :O
[14:00] <sppt> heh
[14:00] <Speljohan_> diablo is supposed to be dark and gritty
[14:00] <Speljohan_> not colourful and "happy"
[14:00] <Bodie> its not colourful and happy
[14:00] <Rev_olution> Yeah I hate what they're doing with diablo
[14:00] <Speljohan_> it is
[14:00] <Azathoth> i'm all for an MMO that hides numbers as much as possible and is more about an enjoyable gaming experience

[14:01] <Pumiotto> i just cant wait for diablo 3!
[14:01] <Speljohan_> but it exists
[14:01] <Rev_olution> The graphics aren't ugly.. There just not in a diablo style.
[14:01] <Speljohan_> i find the blizzard art style awful tho

[14:02] <Bodie> i dunno, i'm a BIG fan of colourful artwork

[14:02] <Bodie> and the over the top stuff
[14:02] <Speljohan_> oh
[14:02] <Speljohan_> and a REALLY bad thing about diablo 3
[14:02] <Bodie> its not out yet?

[14:02] <LG_Legacy> The butcher scared me as a kid

[14:14] <Speljohan_> for NES
[14:14] <Speljohan_> :D
[14:14] <Azathoth> the language only had 15 commands
[14:14] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:14] <Azathoth> so i had to make it multiply using ADD and some strange branch and conditional things
[14:14] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:15] <Azathoth> i don't remember the details
[14:15] <Azathoth> needless to say, i never want to do that shit again

[14:27] <Azathoth> energy drinks make me sick
[14:28] <Azathoth> last semester i somehow managed to stay up about a week without being very tired
[14:28] <Othilious1> For me College was actually useful, due to the constant internships we're supposed to follow. Less theory, more practise is a good thing. Being able to put the theory TO practise is even better.
[14:28] <Azathoth> i don't know why it happened, but it was like hte most productive time of my life D:
[14:29] <Othilious1> Deadlines?
[14:29] <Azathoth> nope
[14:29] <Othilious1> Bored? XD
[14:29] <Azathoth> i don't know
[14:29] <Speljohan_> energy drinks suck
[14:30] <Speljohan_> they just make you even more tired
[14:30] <Othilious1> Yes, yes they do.
[14:30] <Azathoth> i just decided not to sleep, so i didn't

[14:30] <Azathoth> i think i've built up an addiction/immunity to caffeine

[16:29] <vurtual> so I just read about some US guy, after having Australian ambassadors trying to push censorship in the US, telling them how all their "filters" would never work, and how the internet has to be free.
[16:29] <vurtual> That may be the first time I've ever heard anything entirely rational from someone in the government.
[16:29] <Speljohan_> filters r just temporary workarounds
[16:29] <Speljohan_> eventually people will bypass
[16:29] <Speljohan_> etc
[16:30] <vurtual> anyways with people like him we should be ok
[16:30] <Speljohan_> dont count on it
[16:30] <Speljohan_> the internet will die one way or another
[16:30] <vurtual> Well he just told them to go away in their face.
[16:30] <vurtual> The internet can't just "die"
[16:31] <Speljohan_> it can when all countries end up collaborating
[16:31] <Speljohan_> to restrict it and make it only show information they want
[16:31] <vurtual> It's the first time the whole of society can freely act outside of any social rules.
[16:31] <Speljohan_> exactly

[16:38] <tumbleweed> "When I was in high school I knew a guy named Merle who transferred from another school because he got his dick stuck in a shampoo bottle and everyone gave him shit about it.
[16:38] <tumbleweed> Two years later I was in the US Navy and we made a stop in France. I noticed a guy who was on the tour I was on an had a jacket with my hometown's name. I asked where he had gone to school and he told me Etowah High. I asked if he knew Merle. The first thing he said was, "Yeah he got his dick stuck in a shampoo bottle!"

[17:23] <MarkofBear> its till not illegal if you own the damn game
[17:23] <vurtual> it is.
[17:23] <MarkofBear> look it up
[17:23] <vurtual> I've had people, for years, try to say that

[17:41] <MarkofBear> u can read it yoursefl
[17:41] <MarkofBear> just google it

[17:49] <Speljohan_> from war
[17:49] <Speljohan_> or profit off it
[17:49] <MarkofBear> they got the oil for a long time
[17:50] <MarkofBear> but i see your point
[17:50] <vurtual> We were in that area because of things like terrorists and oils and stuff
[17:50] <MarkofBear> and i agree speljoahn_
[17:50] <Speljohan_> they haven't taken any oil MarkofBear
[17:50] <MarkofBear> there you are wrong
[17:50] <Speljohan_> no it is true
[17:50] <bildramer> :/
[17:50] <Speljohan_> they haven't yet

[17:50] <vurtual> Which would have been a disaster due to price conrolling.
[17:50] <Speljohan_> my speculation MarkofBear
[17:50] <MarkofBear> did you know that a truck driver gets 10 times more money than a soldier in iraq spelohan_
[17:50] <Speljohan_> is that they are going to try hold the oil

[17:54] <vurtual> If he had it, then you'd be spending so much that gasoline cars would probably be banned in martial law, to conserve fuel.
[17:54] <Speljohan_> it is irrelevant
[17:54] <Speljohan_> because
[17:54] <Luraman> Oh well, brb
[17:54] <Speljohan_> someone in america would end up inventing a different type of engine
[17:54] <Speljohan_> in no time
[17:54] <vurtual> America is a superpower, also, and that's what superpowers do
[17:54] <vurtual> not really
[17:54] <vurtual> We've been working at full steam, and nothing.
[17:54] <Zuriki> They're probably just invade
[17:54] <vurtual> We have the not-quite-practical hydrogen fuel cells
[17:55] <vurtual> Nuclear power which takes a while
[17:55] <vurtual> And are simply unable to handle a sudden lack of oil
[17:55] <vurtual> Because to a guy like that, an opportunity to destroy the "big America", and make milllions, becoming a world power, in one move, is just too much of an offer to not take.
[17:55] <vurtual> So, we invaded.

[17:56] <vurtual> it very much matters because THE THING YOU'RE TYPING ON EXISTS BECAUSE WE DID THAT
[17:56] <Speljohan_> it is quite inevitable that we will have a world government shortly anyway
[17:56] <Speljohan_> AND?
[17:56] <vurtual> A WORLD GOVERNMENT AIN'T GONNA BE HAPPEN FOR A FEW MILLENIA

[17:57] <vurtual> Nobody is going to accept a world government painly.
[17:57] <vurtual> Ok, ok, that's just cold, man/
[17:57] <Speljohan_> and the cause of all these problems
[17:57] <vurtual> Protestantism did nothing to you ok.
[17:57] <Speljohan_> no religion = no wars
[17:57] <Speljohan_> well
[17:57] <vurtual> what about resource-fuelled wars?
[17:57] <vurtual> Grudge wars?
[17:57] <Zuriki> That's not true
[17:57] <vurtual> Expansion wars?
[17:57] <Speljohan_> expansion wars are long gone
[17:57] <Speljohan_> except for america
[17:57] <Speljohan_> lol
[17:57] <Zuriki> Resource wars
[17:57] <vurtual> not really
[17:58] <vurtual> Middle east
[17:58] <vurtual> had Israel apparently capturing land
[17:58] <Speljohan_> israel can gtfo
[17:58] <vurtual> too bad, expansion wars are there
[17:58] <vurtual> resource wars are there(gulf war)
[17:58] <Speljohan_> gaza is for religious reasons however
[17:58] <vurtual> politically-related wars are there(the other gulf war, because insurgents suck.)

[18:37] <Notch> and I'll almost certainly be playing favorites. ;)
[18:37] <misternick4> Cool
[18:37] <Wervyn> Only special people from IRC.
[18:37] <setveen> everyone, or just a select few?
[18:37] <C418> and thats the reason why we have so... many... recently
[18:37] <Wildstyle> how many people will be allowed?
[18:37] <LanternGhost> Ok
[18:37] <Drury> Damn. I cant buy the game :-/
[18:37] <vurtual> Wait no, I need those 11 days to become more care-about-able I guess.
[18:37] <Drewseph> Notch I'd love to help out
[18:37] <Notch> the very first version will just be like three people
[18:37] <Drewseph> would you like some help modeling enemies?
[18:37] <Notch> then after a while, I might just post the link and let as many as can join, join
[18:37] <vurtual> That's... oddly starcraft 2 ish
[18:37] <LanternGhost> ^
[18:37] <Drewseph> I could give it a try if you want
[18:37] <Notch> the server will get full, and it WILL crash, but that's good testing :D
[18:37] <Demki> I assume he will pick people from here, test, once most big bugs are fixed he will release it for the rest...
[18:37] <LanternGhost> :D
[18:37] <gazab> will they be allowed to stream it?
[18:38] <Bodie> imagine if it worked perfect first go
[18:38] <LanternGhost> ^
[18:38] <Notch> Yes, you can stream it, or screenshot it
[18:38] <Bodie> that would be crazy
[18:38] <Notch> but don't distribute any clients, as usual
[18:38] <LanternGhost> sam=me queston for streaming
[18:38] <gazab> ofc
[18:38] <LanternGhost> ok cool.

[18:38] <Iguana> Notch, just make it you, ez, and Siiseli
[18:38] <LanternGhost> do you know about that one trick to bypass the account check?
[18:38] <Drewseph> k
[18:38] <Wervyn> I assume it's mainly for the purposes of gradually stress testing the thing.
[18:38] <Iguana> Do it! :D
[18:38] <Drewseph> see ya
[18:38] <FNugget> hi
[18:38] <Demki> enjoy :D

[18:38] <misternick4> Notch, Im having troble with the infdev can you help? It cant finish loading or making a map then it just gos black!!
[18:38] <Wervyn> If 10,000 people get on at once, and it crashes, no one has any fun.

[18:39] <FNugget> Notch: play favorites with me
[18:39] <FNugget> that sounds dirty. =/
[18:39] <misternick4> No idea what your talking about
[18:39] <LanternGhost> Wervyn I am sure it would cap at around 24 players or something
[18:39] <misternick4> HD space?
[18:39] <Wildstyle> meh i got Admining to do on my server
[18:39] <Demki> probably

[18:40] <Iguana> Hard drive.
[18:40] <Notch> I got a few more minutes, she just left work. :D
[18:40] <Wervyn> LanternGhost: Meaning 9976 people are left pinging the server. But yeah, probably.
[18:40] <LanternGhost> Lol
[18:40] <misternick4> Oh, I got plenty of hard drive
[18:40] <LanternGhost> Good point Wervyn
[18:40] <Wildstyle> Its a bit funny...when i first started WoM
[18:40] <Iguana> Notch, explain to us.
[18:40] <Demki> Hard Drive, that's where you store stuff...

[18:40] <Iguana> Okey doke.
[18:40] <LanternGhost> So thats an ETA I was looking for
[18:40] <Wildstyle> another Admin tricked me into think notch was on with /say
[18:40] <LanternGhost> I guess I will say 1 week mim and 2 weeks max for a test
[18:40] <Demki> Friday next week, cause today is friday
[18:40] <Wildstyle> but now i'm actually talking to notch
[18:41] <Notch> yeah, next week

[18:41] <Wervyn> Notch is not used to the power of fame and tends to cause bandwidth flashmobs with his blog.
[18:41] <Notch> I didn't get much done these two last days.. UDP is.. weird. :D

[18:41] <Notch> not in the first version, but later on for sure
[18:41] <LanternGhost> Oh Notch! You should add in more farmable things!
[18:41] <Iguana> Will weapon damage do the same amount as they do to NPCs?
[18:41] * SMP (SMP@68-114-62-5.dhcp.davl.vt.charter.com) has joined #minecraft
[18:41] <Notch> probably, yes
[18:41] <LanternGhost> Maybe like grain and berries or something
[18:41] <setveen> moo
[18:41] <Notch> more farming, yes
[18:41] <Iguana> Ohgod, diamond swords will be scary.
[18:41] <Notch> pumpkins :D
[18:41] <Fractal> and Notch, that means lavafloor trap
[18:41] <Morkraw> notch, is there gold and diamond in current infdev?
[18:41] <LanternGhost> Nice!
[18:41] <Notch> there is
[18:41] <setveen> Notch, you need to add cows to minecraft
[18:41] <Bodie> i love farming in games
[18:41] <Bodie> so much
[18:41] <Drury> Yea, pumpkins :D
[18:41] <Iguana> Corn.
[18:41] <LanternGhost> Notch what about a potion system? Or drink system?
[18:42] <Demki> Notch, I WANTS BREEDIN' SHEEP!
[18:42] <Demki> caps
[18:42] <Notch> I love potions
[18:42] <Iguana> Corn stocks would look prety cool.
[18:42] <Notch> And breeding, too

[18:42] <Morkraw> awesome, i just finished a massive castle on my infdev and i would hate to have to make a new map to get the good stuff
[18:42] <LanternGhost> Mixing the right things from farming makes a potion
[18:42] <setveen> you _need_ to add cows to minecraft
[18:42] <Notch> first up is MP, though
[18:42] <setveen> :p
[18:42] <Notch> then getting infdev to indev playable level
[18:42] <Demki> sure
[18:42] <LanternGhost> Such as strawberries with wheat would make a health potion or something
[18:42] <Demki> MP is da best
[18:42] <Notch> THEN I can start adding new things again :D
[18:42] <Wildstyle> Breeding- put two pigs in a wooden box and wait a couple of days
[18:42] <Fractal> so Notch no water until after MP?
[18:42] <setveen> like cows?
[18:42] <LanternGhost> Nice
[18:42] <Notch> yep, fractal
[18:42] <Fractal> nooo
[18:42] <LanternGhost> lol
[18:42] <Wervyn> Looks like I'll still be futzing around with indev for awhile.
[18:42] <LanternGhost> Personally I really want MP
[18:42] <Demki> I need torches in creative
[18:42] <Fractal> indignant rage!
[18:43] <Notch> cows, goops, pumpkins, brick
[18:43] <LanternGhost> Also I really want caves in infdev
[18:43] <Drury> No, you dont
[18:43] <setveen> woo!
[18:43] <LanternGhost> Hey Notch so MP will be played on infdev maps?
[18:43] <Iguana> Notch, how will you stop the new breed of griefer? The one that runs around stepping on crops, flooding caves, stealing torches, etc? :P
[18:43] <Drury> I mean torches in creative
[18:43] <Demki> Notch, will there be bird mobs?
[18:43] <Iguana> Or will they just have to be there?
[18:43] <LanternGhost> Iguana I wouldn't call them griefers
[18:43] <Wildstyle> Evil Crows
[18:43] <LanternGhost> They are more like bandits
[18:43] <Wildstyle> that attack you when you get near there nests
[18:43] <Chompers> when will you add boats to MC?
[18:43] <Demki> that will be rather small and fly, but they drop meat and feathers
[18:43] <LanternGhost> Or thiefs
[18:43] <Iguana> Griefer by definition is just someone who wrecks havok.
[18:43] <Chompers> sail the ocean
[18:43] <Iguana> So I'd consider them griefers. :P
[18:43] <LanternGhost> Well then take up your sword and slay him!
[18:44] <Malikat_> oh snap
[18:44] <Iguana> Hah.

[18:44] <Notch> yes, MP on infdev maps
[18:44] <Malikat_> what! i have an underbar D:
[18:44] <Iguana> We need some order of white knights.
[18:44] <Demki> and they will probably eat your cropz
[18:44] <LanternGhost> Ok
[18:44] <Demki> XD
[18:44] * Malikat_ is now known as Malikat
[18:44] <Iguana> We shall purge servers of those damned bandits.
[18:44] <Iguana> :D
[18:44] <Notch> griefing will be a problem, yes
[18:44] <Demki> Malikat...
[18:44] <SMP> when can we expect all these sexy new updates to hit creative
[18:44] <LanternGhost> Hide your crops better?
[18:44] <Malikat> hello demki
[18:44] <SMP> post beta? or launching with beta?
[18:44] <Morkraw> white knights? thats racist!
[18:44] <FNugget> i guess you'd have to make traps to protect against greifers
[18:44] <Drury> I think you should make creative MP for paid users, but only for one day, to see if it reduces griefing, Nothc
[18:44] <Notch> SMP: Once infdev and indev are the same, I'll add a game mode switch thingie
[18:44] <LanternGhost> Make a giant pit with sand down the hall
[18:44] <SMP> awesome
[18:44] <LanternGhost> wait nvm
[18:44] <Notch> so you can play survival or creative with the same binaries (same client, same server)
[18:45] <LanternGhost> the snad would fall in the pit
[18:45] <Notch> and that's when the game will be beta :D
[18:45] <Wervyn> In any setting, the number of people who enjoy building sand castles is far outmatched by the number of people who enjoy kicking them over. This is because it's always easier to destroy something than to create it.
[18:45] <SMP> yesss
[18:45] <Wervyn> Simple entropy.

[18:45] <setveen> So Notch, have you thought of creative mode infinite maps?
[18:45] <Notch> LanternGhost: No, it depends on how well MP works
[18:45] <setveen> would that be something in the future?
[18:45] <LanternGhost> Alright
[18:45] <Notch> setveen: Yes, it'll be on these maps
[18:45] <setveen> sweet
[18:45] <BearClaw89_MarkofBear> i would like signs in infdev

[18:46] <Demki> I need signs for the mazes
[18:46] <Wervyn> Like I said, power of fame.
[18:46] <LanternGhost> How would signs work Notch? You write something on it and the someones presses a key on it to pop up a message?
[18:46] <FNugget> I've been idling here for a long time, I'm not new
[18:46] <BearClaw89_MarkofBear> the chatroom exploded when notch singed in xD
[18:46] <Notch> I want to do a technical blog soon, explaining something like the rendering or something
[18:46] <FNugget> We had signs before
[18:46] <Notch> you'll see the text on the actual sign
[18:47] <LanternGhost> Is there a text limit or something?
[18:47] <BearClaw89_MarkofBear> wouldnt that make a lot of minecraft clones notch?
[18:47] <Notch> clones are good!
[18:47] <Notch> it's how we get more games to play
[18:47] <LanternGhost> Because what if I made a really, really, really, long thing.
[18:47] <exe-> Notch: have seen Manic Digger?
[18:47] <TerraSleet> attack of the clones
[18:47] <SMP> Notch: will you ever add the missing characters in game? Like "^" for example
[18:47] <Notch> I haven't, no
[18:47] <exe-> http://manicdigger.sourceforge.net/
[18:47] <Demki> Notch, will you be able to make a sign, that instead of text, has an image(like 32x32 pixels or something)
[18:47] <Notch> I might just add full unicode support, yes..
[18:47] <LanternGhost> I am thinking of making a similar game like minecraft on the IPod/IPhone/IPad
[18:47] <BearClaw89_MarkofBear> oh btw notch have you seen queel soolar (alias love)
[18:47] <Notch> I'll miss the pixellated font
[18:47] <BearClaw89_MarkofBear> its a minecraft clone.. with guns!
[18:47] <LanternGhost> Ahh I see
[18:47] <Notch> go for it, LanternGhost! =D
[18:47] <BearClaw89_MarkofBear> and ehm... not 8 bit
[18:47] <LanternGhost> :D
[18:47] <LanternGhost> Just gotta get me a mac first
[18:48] <LanternGhost> Hopefully sometime in the next two weeks
[18:48] <Notch> oh yeah, I've seen manicdigger. =)
[18:48] <vurtual> unicode, but use the pixel-font
[18:48] <Notch> my mac is still stuck in the post
[18:48] <vurtual> and any bad characters become boxen
[18:48] <TerraSleet> it looks so horribly ripped lol
[18:48] <Plinky> Hmm.
[18:48] <LanternGhost> Damn
[18:48] <Demki> Notch, I would really like to see a sign that you can configure to show a 32x32/62x62 px image
[18:48] * Plinky enteres lurk mode
[18:48] <Malikat> Notch: you need a bigger mailbox.
[18:48] <Notch> yeah, the ones where they use my textures are a bit crappy..
[18:48] <IceGuest_75_> Notch, im having problems with infdev, can you help me?
[18:48] <arxx> Oh , hey , whats up?
[18:48] <vurtual> no he can't IceGuest_75_
[18:48] <Demki> (which you can make)

[18:48] <Plinky> Ohwait, notch is here?
[18:49] <arxx> And notch , how's the developing going?
[18:49] <Notch> what kind of problems?
[18:49] <Zuriki> Ohai Notch.
[18:49] <TerraSleet> not only that but they stole the art really badly
[18:49] <LanternGhost> Wow
[18:49] <Notch> Malikat: Hah! It's the ash!
[18:49] <LanternGhost> Manic Digger looks very similar to Minecraft
[18:49] <Chompers> so, about those boats
[18:49] <TerraSleet> the brightness is messed up, and glass and water is messed up
[18:49] <Plinky> Notch, that is how all of the good MMOs exist.
[18:49] <Zuriki> I just got back, been playing some DnD with porn star buddies
[18:49] <Fractal> Notch: bad news: pig based logic is very slow, and doesn't handle being left alone :(
[18:49] <TerraSleet> manic digger looks pretty shite :\
[18:49] <Plinky> They took a basic idea, copied it but improved on it.
[18:49] <Plinky> XD

[18:50] <BearClaw89_MarkofBear> iceguest_75_ dont go away from the screen let it load first
[18:50] <Notch> do you mean Love?
[18:50] <setveen> Also Notch, for creative mode, have you ever thought about adding cloths that colors are HEX based? Because most of the time i cant make pixel art because of lacking the colors
[18:50] <LanternGhost> What was it written in?
[18:50] <TerraSleet> yes Notch
[18:50] <BearClaw89_MarkofBear> yeah i mean love
[18:50] <exe-> i wrote manic digger. i want to make a different game mode. original client is not really important.
[18:50] <LanternGhost> Ahh Sevteen that would be cool

[21:48] <Malikat> then i was like "... heinlein you're interesting to read but what"
[21:48] <Gyro> Haha, really?

[21:51] <Malikat> because he came up with a story arc that contains a dimensional hopping machine, that can travel on any of the four normal dimensions (height, length, depth, time) and the two other time dimensions, one of which allows you to travel to universes that exist from the mind of authors and imagination
