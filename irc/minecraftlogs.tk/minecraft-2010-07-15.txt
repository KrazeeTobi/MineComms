[0:00] <vurtual> all steam games are on a single master disc
[0:00] <ShadowScythe2X> I think my real introduction to computer science was playing manufactoria honestly
[0:00] <vurtual> in valve's hidden underground lab
[0:00] * cheezychicken (cheezychic@saqqara.demon.co.uk) has left #minecraft
[0:00] <bildramer> do an operation with A and B, store the result in A
[0:00] <vurtual> the disc is indestructible, and is essentially a vinyl-sized CD
[0:00] <Clockwork> vurtual: yeah, that disc just has steam on an aol disc : )
[0:00] <bildramer> and get the contents of memory at B and put it in A
[0:00] * Mitagitsu (chatzilla@cpe-076-182-020-132.nc.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:00] <vurtual> if you were to ever infiltrate and remove it
[0:00] <bildramer> or vice-versa
[0:00] <bildramer> that's a CPU
[0:00] <Clockwork> yeah
[0:01] <vurtual> their games will immediately vanish from all the world servers
[0:01] <Conundrumer> hmm
[0:01] <bildramer> there are 65536 different math operations, 4 memory operations
[0:01] <bildramer> so yeah
[0:01] <Conundrumer> for 8 bit
[0:01] <vurtual> and after 24 hours, the data required to run the servers will be gone
[0:01] <bildramer> that's only an example
[0:01] <vurtual> and the steam network will shut down
[0:01] <ShadowScythe2X> bildramer: isn't that third thing the same as the first thing?
[0:01] <bildramer> still needs input and output
[0:01] <bildramer> no, put and get
[0:01] <Conundrumer> does a turing machine count?
[0:01] <bildramer> probably
[0:01] <ShadowScythe2X> hm what's the difference
[0:01] <Clockwork> bildramer: ...so easy
[0:01] <programax> So....I think there is some logic behind spawns. Baddies don't spawn in light, nothing spawns near you...I wonder how much logic is in there. Must there be an open space of at least XxY for something to spawn? Probably not
[0:01] <bildramer> ...yes
[0:01] <Lutin> bildramer: lol two registers?
[0:02] <programax> trying to find a way to keep pigs / sheep from spawning in my house
[0:02] <bildramer> most of the 65536 are practically useless
[0:02] * Piecat (chatzilla@adsl-76-199-171-207.dsl.milwwi.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:02] <bildramer> we could use addition, multiplication, subtraction
[0:02] <bildramer> and have 3 levers
[0:02] <bildramer> lol
[0:02] <Clockwork> bildramer: it take a long time to make a decoder in minecraft, let alone an alu or register file
[0:02] <bildramer> 2*
[0:02] * Mitagitsu (chatzilla@cpe-076-182-020-132.nc.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:02] <bildramer> yeah
[0:02] <Lutin> add, mul, sub, div, mov
[0:02] <bildramer> but we have infinite space
[0:02] <bildramer> -_-
[0:02] <Clockwork> no
[0:02] <Lutin> That's all you need
[0:02] <Clockwork> only 300x300x3000
[0:02] <bildramer> why only 300^3?
[0:02] <Conundrumer> where does the 3000 come from
[0:02] <bildramer> er
[0:02] <Conundrumer> the height is 127
[0:02] <bildramer> what.
[0:02] <bildramer> ^]
[0:03] <Nihil> Lutin: inc, dec, ptr++, ptr--, looping stuff
[0:03] <bildramer> limited height, wat do
[0:03] <Nihil> is the easiest way to do it
[0:03] <bildramer> oh, I forgot
[0:03] <ShadowScythe2X> it'd be nice if water could flow through doors
[0:03] <Clockwork> block only load up to 300 away
[0:03] <bildramer> instruction pointer
[0:03] <bildramer> >_<
[0:03] <Nihil> then your programs will be a turing-complete subset of Brainfuck
[0:03] <Lutin> Nihil: Well yeah, but he's apparently only implementing an ALU
[0:03] <Lutin> Mmm, brainfuck
[0:03] <bildramer> I guess
[0:03] <Nihil> ah
[0:03] <Piecat> infinite* (It isn't truly infinate.)
[0:03] <bildramer> brainfuck counts
[0:03] <Clockwork> as nothing....
[0:03] <Conundrumer> it's 600*600^127
[0:03] <Clockwork> its kinda like whitespace
[0:03] * Piecat (chatzilla@adsl-76-199-171-207.dsl.milwwi.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:03] <bildramer> only 3 bits
[0:03] <Conundrumer> erm
[0:03] <bildramer> increment and decrement
[0:03] <Conundrumer> 600*600*127
[0:04] <bildramer> it's not infinite herp derp
[0:04] <bildramer> it's only some millions of times the surface area of the earth
[0:04] <Clockwork> also, any amount of memory would be huge
[0:04] <bildramer> right
[0:04] <vurtual> 8
[0:04] <Nihil> <bildramer> it's only some millions of times the surface area of the earth
[0:05] <Nihil> from what i can see
[0:05] <bildramer> we can have at least 20 bytes
[0:05] <bildramer> \o/
[0:05] <Nihil> minecraft=900million sqkm
[0:05] <Nihil> earth=510million sqkm
[0:05] <bildramer> wat
[0:05] <Conundrumer> so here are my options: conway's game of life, 4 function calculator, 6 bit typer+4*4 pixel character display, or 3/2 turing machine
[0:05] <vurtual> game of life
[0:05] <bildramer> Minecraft = 18446744073709551616 square meters
[0:05] <vurtual> the boardgame
[0:05] <Clockwork> life
[0:05] <bildramer> display
[0:05] <Neoboy80> Yes, life
[0:05] <bildramer> I wonder how you'll do a display
[0:05] <vurtual> pokemon
[0:05] <bildramer> trust me, a GoL cell is huge
[0:05] <Lutin> Get a girlfriend
[0:05] <Conundrumer> I've done it before
[0:06] <Clockwork> no its not
[0:06] <Conundrumer> @bildramer and Lutin
[0:06] <Clockwork> i saw a thingy
[0:06] <Clockwork> it was only like 20 gates
[0:06] <bildramer> well
[0:06] <bildramer> do life then.
[0:06] <vurtual> create a game boy
[0:06] <vurtual> oh man
[0:06] <Lutin> Conundrumer: Didn't like it?
[0:06] <Conundrumer> I know how all of them will work, and they're not going to be unfunctioally huge
[0:06] <vurtual> a working game boy in minecraft
[0:06] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.69.18) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:06] <Conundrumer> lutin, unfortunately
[0:06] <Conundrumer> well, I did like it
[0:06] <Conundrumer> but then meh, screw relationships
[0:06] * Curly-Brace (Curly-Brac@65.69.162.247) has joined #minecraft
[0:06] <Neoboy80> Redstone dust opens up a world of possibilities
[0:07] <vurtual> with a lua script to control a bunch of switches in a game cart to load games
[0:07] <Clockwork> lol
[0:07] <vurtual> ...
[0:07] <vurtual> I would honestly pay to see that
[0:07] <Conundrumer> when smp comes out you can make it yourself
[0:07] <Conundrumer> with some help of course
[0:08] <vurtual> yeah maybe a team of engineers
[0:08] <vurtual> and nintendo's consent
[0:08] <vurtual> I got distracted when making my hl2 map and now I don't want to anymore
[0:08] <Conundrumer> Wervyn basically gave me all his plans for Conway's Game of Life
[0:08] <vurtual> stupid lack of attention span
[0:08] * liq3 (liquidman3@ppp118-209-197-11.lns20.mel6.internode.on.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:08] <vurtual> next major goal?
[0:08] <vurtual> The death star
[0:08] <Conundrumer> so I'm hesitant on making it since I don't want to take all the credit
[0:08] <vurtual> simple logic things to working computer
[0:08] <vurtual> to game boy
[0:08] <vurtual> to death star
[0:09] * Dragoon_Jett (whois@bas1-montreal48-1176431739.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
[0:09] <Koppis> we got death star, we got death star
[0:09] <vurtual> you have a very primitive death star plans Conundrumer
[0:09] <vurtual> get it to the rebels
[0:09] <vurtual> asap
[0:09] * quaxar (Poopoopee@c-76-104-190-132.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)

[0:09] <Conundrumer> death star has already been done in minecraft
[0:09] <Conundrumer> it does nothing except look badass
[0:09] <Clockwork> hmm
[0:10] <Clockwork> i wonder....
[0:10] <AJ73> I'm going to make some replicas of EVE spaceships
[0:11] <vurtual> a functional one Conundrumer
[0:11] <vurtual> instead of just this: http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/9979/thatsnomoon.png
[0:11] <vurtual> that or that's a really far away replica
[0:11] <vurtual> as a giant 3D sprite
[0:12] <bildramer> fuck yeah
[0:12] <bildramer> coke
[0:12] <vurtual> don't get into drugs now bildramer
[0:12] <vurtual> you might end up giving me 100 dollars and having me beat up drug dealers
[0:13] <bildramer> coca-cola*
[0:13] <bildramer> um
[0:13] <bildramer> we need an universe simulation in Minecraft
[0:13] <bildramer> then we can have a working death star

[0:14] <iPhoenix> hi :)
[0:14] <bildramer> your presence is of no interest to u--- hello
[0:14] <bildramer> so
[0:14] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JZCR4D-QHU this is why we're getting youtube error
[0:14] <bildramer> game of life cell
[0:14] * hanneshdc (matiehanne@HSI-KBW-109-193-027-021.hsi7.kabel-badenwuerttemberg.de) has joined #minecraft
[0:14] <bildramer> if this is a gabe newell video, it was to be expected
[0:14] <vurtual> the old spice man is making youtube videos
[0:15] <wareya> 16:13 < bildramer> we need an universe simulation in Minecraft
[0:15] * hanneshdc (matiehanne@HSI-KBW-109-193-027-021.hsi7.kabel-badenwuerttemberg.de) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:15] <bildramer> oh
[0:15] <wareya> how to planets?
[0:15] <bildramer> wat

[0:15] <bildramer> uh
[0:15] <bildramer> ...
[0:16] * sllide (jari@ip565eb113.direct-adsl.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:16] <bildramer> lots of atoms together?

[0:16] <bildramer> ...
[0:16] <wareya> 16:13 < bildramer> we need an universe simulation in Minecraft
[0:16] <bildramer> I mean with redstone
[0:16] <bildramer> particles
[0:16] <bildramer> and shit
[0:16] <iPhoenix> creating a large sphere in the sky, I guess
[0:16] <wareya> hahaha
[0:16] <hannesh> it would be great to have planets as balls, then you can walk around to find day / night winter summer etc...
[0:16] <wareya> it couldn't be a sphere because of cube blocks

[0:17] <wareya> it would have to be a cube
[0:17] <iPhoenix> well, sphere-shaped meshes
[0:17] <hannesh> you could wrap the flat map around a sphere
[0:17] <bildramer> my malkavian mod won't work
[0:17] <wareya> with gravity corrosponding to the side it's on
[0:17] * Jougi (asd.asd@a91-155-83-247.elisa-laajakaista.fi) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:17] <wareya> 16:17 < hannesh> you could wrap the flat map around a sphere
[0:17] <hannesh> that doesn't work properly
[0:17] <wareya> it would loop in the most fucked up ways
[0:17] <hannesh> the cube world*
[0:17] <wareya> yes it does
[0:17] * Clockwork (clockowrk@c-68-40-207-123.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
[0:18] <hannesh> I tried it in my engine, the gravity undergroud gets really annoying
[0:18] <wareya> gravity mapped to the face that physics things are on
[0:18] <wareya> well
[0:18] <vurtual> a notable feature of my speakers is that they can convey how loud gunfire is
[0:18] <vurtual> not like, ear-shattering, but it can starrtle you
[0:18] <hannesh> you have to cut a diagonal line through this cube to where the gravity changes
[0:18] <vurtual> so when I'm firing a pistol in garry's mod, everybody hears it
[0:18] <vurtual> like, outside too
[0:18] <wareya> yes
[0:19] * Woodenwindows (Woodenwind@174-20-49-193.mpls.qwest.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:19] <bildramer> woot 4096x4096 bitmap files
[0:19] <Conundrumer> I made a sun in Minecraft
[0:19] <hannesh> and then you get really annoyed when you hit this edge when tunneling
[0:19] <bildramer> 48 MB
[0:19] <bildramer> hehehehe
[0:19] <wareya> okay
[0:19] <bildramer> vurtual, smg+manhacks
[0:19] <wareya> I can see that
[0:19] <wareya> but it's the only way I can see to do it without breaking the map structure
[0:19] <wareya> that is, cubes.
[0:20] <hannesh> also it badly messes with the mapgen, i never found a way to get mountians on edge looking right
[0:20] * Clockwork (clockowrk@c-68-40-207-123.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft

[0:20] <hannesh> well its initially a great idea, but it ends up not working
[0:20] <iPhoenix1> ahh, relog
[0:20] <thelastchud> hey guys can you please help me my minecraft is messing up i go to the alpha and it load's and then it go's black and if i scroll it go's white what do i do
[0:20] <Clockwork> You know what, i think i will design an 8 bit alu in minecraft
[0:20] <wareya> What else is there?
[0:20] <iPhoenix1> iPhoenix should timeout any second
[0:20] <hannesh> well water physics was a real bitch
[0:21] <AJ73> You can't have spaces in any character names in Minecraft right? I'm going to buy it and wanted to make sure
[0:21] <wareya> I mean for making planets with cubes
[0:21] <Conundrumer> clockwork, do you care about efficiency with space?
[0:21] <Clockwork> yes
[0:21] <Clockwork> im going to see if i can make it reasonably small
[0:21] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.69.18) has joined #minecraft
[0:21] <Clockwork> then we'll sea bout other things
[0:21] * Predobear (DickNipple@dsl-217-155-16-102.zen.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
[0:22] <hannesh> ah, well what worked well for us, is creating the illusion of a sphere by sinking the tiles in the distance slightly
[0:22] <wareya> So you just mess with the renderer?
[0:22] * iPhoenix (Mibbit@dyndsl-095-033-082-074.ewe-ip-backbone.de) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[0:22] <hannesh> when done right, it created awesome looking round planets
[0:22] <wareya> How does it work when you work on the mapping?
[0:22] * outsomnia (wahaha@adsl-69-225-235-128.dsl.skt2ca.pacbell.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:22] <bildramer> >optipng
[0:22] <bildramer> >16777216 pixels
[0:22] <bildramer> brb 1 hour
[0:22] <hannesh> I just made one edge loop aroud to the other
[0:23] <Conundrumer> okay, first, will inputs/outputs be in binary or decimal?
[0:23] <wareya> And for the poles?
[0:23] <hannesh> so its fully unrealistic, but it looks good
[0:23] <hannesh> same thing
[0:23] <ShadowScythe2X> binary is much easier aye
[0:23] <hannesh> it doesn't spatially work
[0:23] * Evicous (chatzilla@c-69-244-48-242.hsd1.az.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.6/20100625231939])
[0:23] <wareya> breaks otuer space
[0:23] <Clockwork> me?
[0:23] <wareya> yes
[0:23] <bildramer> thelastchud, do you have the last Java?
[0:23] <bildramer> latest8
[0:23] <bildramer> **
[0:23] <AJ73> Can you guys see what I'm saying? Or do you just not care
[0:24] <bildramer> also, you do not use 's for verbs
[0:24] <Clockwork> Conundrumer: who are you talking to
[0:24] <hannesh> but the point was that it looked great, and you cold walk and get back where you started
[0:24] <wareya> you could do it by projecting a rectangular sheet around a sphere so that all of its corners and edges meet.
[0:24] <Clockwork> Dont care
[0:24] * Varriount (Varriount@pool-96-255-204-117.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has left #minecraft
[0:24] <AJ73> ah cool, just had a single question
[0:24] <hannesh> I had a thought about that, but the poles would have all the cubes coming together as tiny wedges
[0:24] * Pure_Adrenallen (chatzilla@cpe-71-79-13-8.cinci.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft

[0:25] <Pure_Adrenallen> Hola me llamo es Pure
[0:25] <Conundrumer> you, clockwork
[0:25] <wareya> That's unless you mesesed with the renderer again
[0:25] <bildramer> there's the problem of cubes getting smaller when approaching the center
[0:25] <bildramer> and vice-versa
[0:25] <hannesh> but then you get your spatial impossibilities again
[0:25] <Pure_Adrenallen> A month ago nobody on my steam friends knew anything about Minecraft, now everybody is playing it. Crazy how fast Minecraft is growing.
[0:25] * thelastchud (Mibbit@c-67-175-30-52.hsd1.in.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[0:25] <wareya> But you acn change the renderer as you get further away
[0:25] <wareya> can*
[0:26] <wareya> so when it counts, it's spatially correct
[0:26] * hatman (Mibbit@pool-72-87-4-31.spknwa.dsl-w.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:26] <hannesh> i'm not sure what you mean
[0:26] <Clockwork> Conundrumer: how would you even do dec
[0:26] <wareya> Okay.
[0:26] <bildramer> lol
[0:26] <wareya> Whatever.
[0:26] <Conundrumer> convert decimal to binary, compute, and convert back
[0:26] <bildramer> BCD
[0:26] <bildramer> the nightmare of--
[0:26] <hannesh> can we private chat? if it actually worked, i'd love to implement it
[0:26] <Clockwork> ....
[0:26] <bildramer> wait wait wait.
[0:26] <bildramer> how the hell are you going to do decimal?
[0:26] <Clockwork> Conundrumer: no, that foolish
[0:26] <Conundrumer> convert using BCD i mean
[0:26] <Clockwork> wait, i still dont get it
[0:26] <wareya> It wouldn't work well unless it were perfect.
[0:26] <bildramer> you only have the ON and the OFF setting
[0:26] <Clockwork> oooh
[0:26] <bildramer> lolololololol BCD
[0:27] <Clockwork> yeah no
[0:27] <Clockwork> binary
[0:27] <Clockwork> always binary
[0:27] <wareya> It's a thing of changing hwo the cubes are rendered as they get closer to the pole, and how close you are to the cubes.
[0:27] <gear> every day i wait silently
[0:27] <gear> for the day's blog post
[0:27] <gear> and as 6 o clock approaches
[0:27] * E_net4 (IceChat7@bl20-179-172.dsl.telepac.pt) has joined #minecraft

[0:28] <gear> i get increasinly anxious
[0:28] <bildramer> stop interrupting the monologue
[0:28] <Clockwork> well, if your looking at what i think you are

[0:28] <bildramer> >your >you are
[0:28] <Clockwork> that guy spent several hours optimizing that
[0:28] * chariot (charitoPL@cpe-065-188-062-039.sc.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:28] <bildramer> it's one think making a mistake
[0:28] <bildramer> thing*
[0:28] <gear> hey guys
[0:28] <hannesh> hmm, but you still have all the cubes having to meet at one point at the pole, there's nothing you can really change about that
[0:28] <bildramer> but not understanding why it is wrong while doing the right thing in the same sentence...
[0:28] <gear> the other day i was trying to make a really long line of circuit
[0:28] <Conundrumer> hmm
[0:29] <gear> to blow up a block
[0:29] <wareya> I just mapped it with a cube the last time I modeled it.
[0:29] <SireTRM> Double inverters.
[0:29] <bildramer> actually
[0:29] <wareya> that is, a cobe like I said to begin with, that looksed and acted like a sphere underground
[0:29] <bildramer> one inverter every 15 blocks, even number of inverters
[0:29] <bildramer> that's better
[0:29] <wareya> spell not
[0:29] <Clockwork> depends
[0:29] <Clockwork> on timing
[0:29] <hannesh> that could work actually
[0:29] <bildramer> ...
[0:30] <wareya> yours could work too
[0:30] <bildramer> it uses less torches
[0:30] <bildramer> and less time

[0:30] <Clockwork> yeah
[0:30] <Clockwork> no loess torches
[0:30] <wareya> but all the edges and points would be infinitely close together when rendered as a sphere

[0:30] <bildramer> yes, less torches....
[0:30] <Clockwork> something need an increased delay in a limited space
[0:30] <Clockwork> how less torches, doesnt the double inverter use 2?
[0:30] <bildramer> yes
[0:31] <wareya> Actually, that would make more sense.

[0:31] <Conundrumer> you can use d flops+clock
[0:31] <bildramer> and one inverter every 15 blocks uses 1 per 15/17 blocks
[0:31] <Conundrumer> wait
[0:31] <Conundrumer> what are we talking about
[0:31] <bildramer> lol

[0:32] <hannesh> well if you take a sphere, you can texture it by placing 6 almost-squares on them
[0:32] <bildramer> the second is obviously better
[0:32] <Clockwork> depends
[0:32] <hannesh> the same method can be used

[0:36] <hannesh> haha, but i find the redstone system stupid, which is why my game will have wire cubes that glow when on, and gate cubes
[0:36] <Clockwork> its actually wouldnt change much

[0:39] <Clockwork> do you know what fractals are?
[0:39] <bildramer> and then I do modulo 2
[0:39] <Conundrumer> a fractal is a recursive pattern

[0:39] <St4ud3> Yes and they look completely different
[0:39] <Clockwork> lol, your just going by looks
[0:39] <Conundrumer> what is your definition?
[0:39] <programax> woh, I missed something awesome. How do you plan to make gates now? Can water flow through an open door, hit a pressure plate, then close the door

[0:39] <bildramer> ...
[0:39] <Clockwork> Conundrumer: your right
[0:39] <bildramer> that qualifies as a fractal
[0:39] <programax> then run off, releasing the pressure plate to open the door again, thus creating your clock?
[0:39] <bildramer> you can zoom in in the top right corner
[0:39] <bildramer> in fact I'll just try to do that

[0:40] <Conundrumer> it wouldn't work in the first place
[0:40] <programax> oh
[0:40] <programax> right :D
[0:40] <programax> so how are you guys making gates?
[0:40] <bildramer> interesting
[0:40] <Conundrumer> we copy off others
[0:41] <bildramer> lol
[0:41] <bildramer> I figured AND by myself

[0:41] <Conundrumer> i figured out all the basic ones except XOR

[1:27] <Nihil> no, anything*3072
[1:28] <Kizzycocoa> yay! progress
[1:28] <E_net4> Also, you just mixed the 2 of them. S is for SET, R is for RESET.

[1:28] <ACarroll> well if you have 2 monitors
[1:28] <JabJabJab> I have a question guys
[1:28] <bildramer> good job
[1:28] <bildramer> :D
[1:28] <JabJabJab> I found a mob spawn for zombies.. if i delete it and move it will it still be a zombie spawner?
[1:29] <bildramer> Why cannot people just directly ask
[1:29] <bildramer> it will be a pig spawner
[1:29] <JabJabJab> fuck that
[1:29] <JabJabJab> :/
[1:29] <bildramer> oh wait, I think there's a bug and it won't even work

[1:29] <Kizzycocoa> it's taken me 3 days to get to "oh, it's in a chunk"

[1:30] <bildramer> so I have a black bitmap and a setPixel(x,y,c) function and a getPixel(x,y) function
[1:30] <Firetempest> how do you collect a spawner, i did so once but i forgot what tool i used, now they just break
[1:30] <bildramer> wat do
[1:30] <Kizzycocoa> you can't
[1:30] <Kizzycocoa> notch removed the feature to pick them up

[2:20] <Nihil> bildramer: that's fluid dynamics
[2:20] <Nihil> rather than just wind physics
[2:20] <bildramer> ...whatever
[2:20] <bildramer> then I want fluid dynamics
[2:20] <bildramer> lol
[2:21] <E_net4> That's moar complicated.
[2:21] <bildramer> I don't care, I can cope with 1fps
[2:21] <E_net4> I wouldn't want to spend loads of time on a feature that will surely be slow. :P
[2:22] <Scrippy> It is time to make my greatest creation yet
[2:22] <pokeybit> a 3 skinner?
[2:22] <Scrippy> A fountain that spins and spits lava.
[2:22] <ExDee> http://filesmelt.com/dl/Untitled412345.png what just happened
[2:22] <Nihil> :O A fountain that spins around would be awesome.
[2:22] <vurtual> So I found some guy called Thomas Mann in Deus Ex
[2:22] <Nihil> Hey, do doors block water?
[2:22] <ExDee> I walk over here looking for a cave
[2:22] <bildramer> wait wait
[2:22] <Scrippy> Well the fountain doesn't spin.
[2:22] <vurtual> the future of Mann Co!
[2:22] <ExDee> and I find this
[2:22] <Pure_Adrenallen> yes Nihil
[2:22] <bildramer> holy fucking shit thermography
[2:22] <Scrippy> But I can make the lava alternate sides.
[2:22] <bildramer> this is epic
[2:23] <Nihil> That could be a lot of fun Pure_Adrenallen
[2:23] <Pure_Adrenallen> They block it when open as well though
[2:23] <Pure_Adrenallen> :(

[2:23] <NMLittle> Anyone know if in invedit you can put buckets of lava in your inventory
[2:23] <Agarrett> yo
[2:23] <Scrippy> You can.
[2:23] <Nihil> Yeah, you can
[2:23] <Agarrett> im learning java
[2:24] <Scrippy> It's how I make lights.
[2:24] <Nihil> They even have a preset that gives you loads of buckets of lava
[2:24] <Scrippy> Somebody help me think of a timer system
[2:24] <Scrippy> Using freezing water/ice
[2:24] <Agarrett> can anyone tell me what they are using for IDE
[2:24] <Nihil> Does flowing water freeze?
[2:24] <Scrippy> No.
[2:24] <NMLittle> I keep seeing references to gears, are they actually used for anything?
[2:24] <Scrippy> There are no gears.
[2:25] <E_net4> We need lava reservoirs.
[2:25] <Nihil> Agarrett: I've used NetBeans before
[2:25] <Nihil> it's pretty nice

[2:25] <NMLittle> I use netbeans for both my java and PHP development
[2:25] <Pure_Adrenallen> There was infinite lava before
[2:25] <E_net4> It would mean infinite obsidian.
[2:25] <Pure_Adrenallen> then he took it out
[2:25] <Pure_Adrenallen> :(
[2:25] <E_net4> OBSIDIAN.
[2:25] <Nihil> Scrippy: I think he's referring to infinite lava, in the same way you can make infinite water due to glitchy water physics

[2:26] <NMLittle> Would make lighting my bridges much easier.
[2:26] <E_net4> We need cacao trees!
[2:26] <bildramer> so we have an area about the size of half wales
[2:27] <E_net4> So we get cocoa.
[2:27] <E_net4> So we get chocolate
[2:27] <Rooster> We need motherfucking cannons
[2:27] <bildramer> before movement gets choppy and jaggy etc.
[2:27] <bildramer> WE NEED PALMS OF ALL KINDS
[2:27] <bildramer> coconuts
[2:27] <E_net4> So that combined with grain, we get COOKIES.
[2:27] <bildramer> bananas (not a palm)
[2:27] <Rooster> We need to shoot palm trees out of cannons
[2:27] <bildramer> and cocoa
[2:27] <Rooster> NO
[2:27] <bildramer> and a different kind of wood
[2:27] <bildramer> :D
[2:27] <Rooster> Shoot cannons out of cannons that shoot palm trees

[2:28] <Nihil> Unless... the cannons are also palm trees!
[2:28] <Scrippy> Wow.
[2:28] <Scrippy> Major glitch.

[2:30] <Pure_Adrenallen> cuz they freeze back over
[2:31] <Scrippy> Unless you use a ladder.
[2:31] <Scrippy> Which I do.
[2:31] <Nihil> Protip: If you're about to mine a tile which has shitloads of gravel stacked on top, and you're going to have to mine all the gravel as well, place a minecart track below the piece you're about to mine
[2:31] <Nihil> When gravel falls on minecart tracks, it turns from a block into an item, thus automatically mining it all for you

[4:04] <Nihil> Notch would have to hand out CD keys
[4:04] <Shadaez> we've known he wants it on Steam for a long time
[4:04] <Kokopure> shoosh. not eveyone is listening to the stream.
[4:04] <Shadaez> no, months ago
[4:04] <Skillkills> No Shadaez, Some people have asked to be told what is going on
[4:04] <Kokopure> not everyone has
[4:04] <VurtualRuler98> hey, you know what'd be a fun game?
[4:04] <Skillkills> They cannot watch the stream
[4:04] <Kokopure> in fact a lot of people don't know that.
[4:04] <Helar> lol maybe we could re buy MC on steam 8D
[4:04] <VurtualRuler98> after seeing something like moonbase alpha
[4:04] <Kokopure> the guy who asked the question didn't know it.
[4:05] <Kokopure> and I've been told by people that he doesn't want it on Steam.
[4:05] <Shadaez> Kokopure how about you go away
[4:05] <Kokopure> noooo :P
[4:05] <Shadaez> I even gave him the valve email to talk to the guy who handles that stuff
[4:05] <Kokopure> how awesome for you.
[4:05] <VurtualRuler98> a game where you're on some kind of(at least gameplay-worthy advanced, no tarp walls and such) moon base, it has armed enemies in it, and you have to complete a handful of objectives like find something on a computer/get some guy/escape/and so on
[4:05] <Nihil> Helar: Notch could generate keys for each user account that's bought the game, they could then add it to their accounts via that
[4:06] <Kokopure> but the game isn't even close to being finished, so you may have jumped the gun.

[4:06] <VurtualRuler98> and it's entirely up to you to figure out how to do things
[4:06] <Shadaez> these new people are annoying, afk
[4:07] <Nihil> VurtualRuler98: That'd be pretty awesome.
[4:07] <VurtualRuler98> and it'd require actual real life knowledge to do so, but hey we all know how to run and gun already

[4:07] <Nihil> In fact, a more abstract game would be fun, everything has abstract relationships that you have to figure out

[4:11] <Rooster> 1334 people
[4:11] <Nihil> Heat sources would be a pretty awesome idea.
[4:11] <VurtualRuler98> find some kind of newer space suit that's more maneuverable, place a little wireless explosive on a weaker spot that nobody will see, go into the airlock, seal it on their side maybe, and ping it from the terminal inside
[4:11] <Rooster> That chat is a shitstorm
[4:11] <VurtualRuler98> then run around and take all their weapons
[4:11] <ez> I think I'm actually watching the stream both here and on mac lol
[4:11] <Quatroking> Why the fuck do all the minecraft communities (read: groups of 20 teenagers who didn't hit puberty yet) get Notch to do stuff

[4:16] <ExDee> Sheepmen mob
[4:16] <Kokopure> did he take out 3D?
[4:16] <ExDee> pigmen are long over done
[4:16] * Quatroking is back (gone 00:50:55)
[4:16] <Nihil> Yeah, minecraft is now 2D
[4:16] <Jat> yes he took out 3d
[4:17] <ExDee> minecraft is a pioneer, not a follower
[4:17] <Kokopure> aaaagh
[4:17] <ExDee> anagraph
[4:17] <ExDee> ?
[4:17] <ExDee> Ani*
[4:17] <Quatroking> Anaglyph didn't work nice anyways
[4:17] <ExDee> Anigraph is still there I believe.
[4:17] <Nihil> Anaglyph gave me a headache
[4:17] <Nihil> and insulted my mother
[4:17] <Jat> anaglyph sucks, long live cross-eyed 3d
[4:17] <Nihil> and drank all the milk in my fridge
[4:17] <Quatroking> cross-eyed 3d is the worst ever
[4:17] <Jat> no its the best
[4:17] <Jat> just because nobody else but me can do it doesnt make it bad

[4:18] <Nihil> Autostereoscopy (ie. magic eye stuff) would be interesting
[4:18] <Jat> if i am looking at cross-eyed porn there is likely no one else around so i dont care what i look like
[4:18] <Quatroking> and then your dad walks in
[4:18] <Quatroking> looks at you
[4:18] <Jat> i am in my own dorm room
[4:18] <Nihil> I've seen anaglyph porn, not cross-eyed porn
[4:18] <Quatroking> and sees you jerking off while you're eyes are crossed

[4:18] <Quatroking> hurrrr

[4:19] <E_net4> I can't do cross-eye anymore.
[4:19] <E_net4> Probably my myopia.
[4:19] <Quatroking> Hey, ez, where exactly are you now?
[4:19] <Quatroking> Next to Notch?
[4:20] <Quatroking> Also that brocraft is just fucking retarded
[4:20] <Nihil> Random question, somewhat pertaining to the stream: Is there any way to ensure that a door will open in a certain direction?
[4:20] <Quatroking> "May cause autism"

[4:21] <Quatroking> Well, my cams lost connection so I now have to check through IRC
[4:21] <bildramer> I seriously figured all the water physics out

[4:21] <Diablodoct0r> Notch might make Invisible DOors
[4:21] <Diablodoct0r> hi Ez!
[4:21] <Quatroking> I'm just curious if you're playing along with him

[4:21] <bildramer> download, comment
[4:21] <bildramer> if you can't run OpenGL your graphics card sucks anyway
[4:22] <Quatroking> opengl is for pussies
[4:22] <bildramer> I wanted to use SDL
[4:22] <Quatroking> hardcore Adlib sound YO
[4:22] <bildramer> but meh
[4:22] <bildramer> dlls and shit
[4:22] <bildramer> including, all the functions
[4:22] <Nihil> bildramer: It's particle-based rather than grid-based?
[4:22] <bildramer> it is grid-based
[4:22] <bildramer> the particles are just eye candy
[4:22] <Nihil> Ah, I see.
[4:23] <bildramer> so, it loops around
[4:23] <bildramer> toroidal shape
[4:23] <bildramer> because I have no idea what to do with boundaries
[4:23] <bildramer> lol
[4:23] <Nihil> My friend published some paper about fluid dynamics and found that a lot of operations on the grid of particles are quicker when the grid is fourier transformed
[4:23] <Nihil> and made a really awesome engine
[4:23] <Quatroking> I feel sucky right now.
[4:23] <Kokopure> Notch likes explosive arrows.
[4:23] <Nihil> anyway, toroidal is good
[4:23] <Diablodoct0r> OMG
[4:23] <bildramer> also, heh, I didn't look up any of the dynamics at all
[4:23] <Diablodoct0r> ATtach things to Arrows to make em explosive etc
[4:23] <bildramer> no equations and shit
[4:23] <Diablodoct0r> That rcoks
[4:24] <Diablodoct0r> ..
[4:24] <Diablodoct0r> rocks
[4:24] <Kokopure> if Notch likes it, I'm all for it.
[4:24] <bildramer> I just did what seemed right, multiply vectors and stuff

[4:29] <Quatroking> walked into my own room
[4:29] <Nihil> http://brocraft.net/minecraft.html
[4:29] <VurtualRuler98> guys I had this awesome idea
[4:29] <Nihil> Notch is streaming
[4:29] <VurtualRuler98> like, really cool
[4:29] <VurtualRuler98> we send NASA money
[4:29] <VurtualRuler98> Directly.
[4:29] <Quatroking> and all of the sudden i was watching hare+guu
[4:29] <Rooster> Did Notch come in contact with Valve? When was this?
[4:29] <Nihil> and taking questions
[4:29] <VurtualRuler98> All of us, a little bit.
[4:29] <bildramer> ...
[4:29] <VurtualRuler98> Send in five, five times two hundred?
[4:29] <VurtualRuler98> A thousand.
[4:29] <bildramer> guys, I call it a day
[4:29] <VurtualRuler98> And what if the richer types started pouring it in?
[4:29] <programax> HHAHAHA sweet justice

[4:30] <bildramer> ok, finished bragging, time to make a game out of it
[4:30] <Nihil> VurtualRuler98: however, * some of us are not in US
[4:30] <bildramer> fluid dynamics in 2D space
[4:30] <bildramer> it's probably extendable to more dimensions
[4:30] <Nihil> * some of us do not believe space exploration to be worth the money that we'd be investing
[4:30] <Nihil> besides, what good will $1000 be to NASA?
[4:30] <bildramer> haha
[4:30] <bildramer> probably fuel for 1 more microsecond
[4:31] <bildramer> or something as useful
[4:31] <VurtualRuler98> nihil
[4:31] <Drakkar> * some of you are retarded
[4:31] <Nihil> bildramer: should be extendable with no change to the maths
[4:31] <VurtualRuler98> internationally sending money isn't that hard
[4:31] <VurtualRuler98> also nihil
[4:31] <VurtualRuler98> ...
[4:31] <Nihil> also, Drakkar raises a point
[4:31] <VurtualRuler98> space exploration is important
[4:31] <VurtualRuler98> 1000 is a start alright
[4:31] <bildramer> uh, yes, it is
[4:31] <Nihil> VurtualRuler98: yes, i agree, space exploration is important
[4:31] <bildramer> actually if we start a movement, yeah
[4:31] <VurtualRuler98> 1000 is a good start
[4:31] <bildramer> but only 1000$ is nothing
[4:31] * Rooster (stormon@pool-108-13-97-76.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) has left #minecraft
[4:32] <VurtualRuler98> 1000 means they can at least switch out broken coffee machines and soda machines
[4:32] <bildramer> we need to make more people.. er...

[4:32] <Nihil> however, about international spending: why should i, an english person, be interested in funding NASA, the US space agency?
[4:32] <Koppis> Hey guys, is it possible to play INDEV anymore?
[4:32] <VurtualRuler98> Because you have no space agency of your own?
[4:32] <Nihil> minecraft.net/indev/
[4:32] <Nihil> VurtualRuler98: yes we do
[4:32] <bildramer> Nihil, then func the british space agency
[4:32] <Nihil> not a very big one
[4:32] <Animator> Possible, but the link is hidden.

[4:33] <VurtualRuler98> and with enough funding, they can do it faster.
[4:33] <Helar> lol zombie owned
[4:33] <bildramer> well, uh
[4:33] <bildramer> NASA has made more progress than BSA
[4:33] <VurtualRuler98> Imagine if we got a million people to give out five dollars?
[4:33] <bildramer> so it would be more helpful to give it NASA
[4:33] <bildramer> vurtual, :D
[4:34] <VurtualRuler98> and then maybe we'd get more government funding sent to NASA, when people start caring.
[4:34] <Nihil> VurtualRuler98: why have a trillion, when we could have A BILLION!
[4:34] <bildramer> ok, my engine has a single drawback

[4:40] <itsy> hi. can i ask in this channel about an issue im having?
[4:40] <Quatroking> I guess
[4:40] <Kokopure> sure can
[4:40] <Nihil> kenny_simsons: yes, we're all watching it or unable/unwilling to watch
[4:40] <Nihil> you're bringing no news to the channel
[4:40] <EmpiresBane> or don't care
[4:41] <Nihil> As I said, unwilling
[4:41] <itsy> ok im playing the non alpha version with some friends while we use skype to voice chat. but when i am in minecraft it interfers with my mic. anyone have any ideas whats up?
[4:41] <Nihil> Interferes in what way?
[4:41] <EmpiresBane> you. you can't communicate properly
[4:41] <Quatroking> more like EmpiresDick
[4:42] <Quatroking> hurr hurr
[4:42] <itsy> it turns my mic down or something so others cant hear me. but as soon as i put minecraft in the background it works again
[4:42] <Quatroking> itsy, thats windows 7 for ya
[4:42] <EmpiresBane> it's over 100 degrees here...
[4:42] <itsy> im on xp
[4:42] <Quatroking> itsy, thats windows xp for ya

[4:43] <itsy> i wouldntthink so
[4:43] <Quatroking> my crotch smells like piss
[4:43] <EmpiresBane> you should check
[4:43] <Quatroking> I should probably fix this by putting on a fresh pair of bootay holders
[4:43] <itsy> i have my minecraft music and effects turned off anyway
[4:43] <Nihil> Quatroking: i have no idea why notch isn't your bestest buddy for all eternity

[5:39] <SuperLlama> it's the one I use on every forum

[5:39] <Nihil> I like to switch mine periodically

[5:39] <SuperLlama> and the one who Attempted the Impossible
[5:39] <SuperLlama> :P
[5:39] <SuperLlama> wiremod 3? :3
[5:39] <Nihil> which, if you've been away from wirmeod.com for a while, you won't have seen
[5:40] <VurtualRuler98> so guys, I'd like to share a magical moment in gaming with you
[5:40] <SuperLlama> JACK SKELLINGTON, MUAHAHA
[5:40] <Nihil> go find the thread, it was faron asking for donations to upgrade VBull so we could manage the top secret project better
[5:40] <Varriount> Hmm?
[5:40] <Nihil> VurtualRuler98: tell us about it
[5:40] <SuperLlama> thanks
[5:40] <VurtualRuler98> First time I got into a computer in Deus Ex
[5:40] * bildramer (bildramer@p57A1ABB7.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #minecraft
[5:40] <SuperLlama> Lol
[5:40] <VurtualRuler98> and had complete control over the security
[5:40] <VurtualRuler98> it was a wonderful feeling
[5:40] <SuperLlama> "Deus Ex" isn't a complete thought
[5:40] <SuperLlama> (yes I know it's a game)
[5:41] <SuperLlama> but it means "god from the"
[5:41] <SuperLlama> deus ex machina, god from the machine
[5:41] <Nihil> yes, it's part of the idiom "deus ex machina", we're aware
[5:41] <SuperLlama> yeah
[5:41] <SuperLlama> but it sounds dumb if you know latin
[5:41] <Pl0x> Someone explain how this happens? http://i29.tinypic.com/2nhkb2d.jpg
[5:41] <VurtualRuler98> deus ex nostalgia
[5:41] <Nihil> VurtualRuler98: i did that within like five minutes of starting the first mission
[5:41] <SuperLlama> it's like telling someone you're playing "The Game Of"
[5:41] <VurtualRuler98> yeah but like
[5:41] <SuperLlama> inb4 the game
[5:41] <Nihil> Pl0x: lots of sheep?
[5:41] <Pl0x> Yes.
[5:41] <Nihil> they like each other's company
[5:41] <VurtualRuler98> so in ye olde greek times
[5:41] <Pl0x> Why so many?
[5:42] <Nihil> and also the mob spawning code isn't exactly fair
[5:42] <VurtualRuler98> people would shout "deus ex" and everyone be like NOT AGAAIAIN
[5:42] <VurtualRuler98> finding a password and username and being like "this... might be useful"
[5:42] <SuperLlama> latin*
[5:42] <Pl0x> Nihil, how so?
[5:42] <VurtualRuler98> Finding a turret that would attack me
[5:42] <Nihil> putting all the sheep in one place like that
[5:42] <VurtualRuler98> So I ran over into a corner, used this panel
[5:42] <VurtualRuler98> ....put the passwords in
[5:42] <Pl0x> When I play on hard, I hardly ever get mobs
[5:42] <VurtualRuler98> and ohhhhh man complete control
[5:42] <Pl0x> I get more sheep and pigs than monsters
[5:42] <Pl0x> 2 Creepers
[5:42] <Nihil> not entirely realistic, as the turret would gun you down as you typed it in
[5:43] <Nihil> Pl0x: peaceful mode is the hardest :P
[5:43] <Nihil> also lol mibbit
[5:43] <Nihil> also lol firefox skin
[5:43] <Nihil> also lol XP with default theme
[5:43] <Nihil> hmm, what else can i criticise
[5:43] <SuperLlama> why does the top secret project look like UT3
[5:43] <Nihil> SuperLlama: because it's based on UnrealEngine3?
[5:43] <SuperLlama> it is?
[5:44] <SuperLlama> I thought it was gmod :P
[5:44] <Nihil> that much was made apparent in the initial thread
[5:44] <Nihil> "UDK developers wanted, PM me"
[5:44] <Nihil> or something
[5:44] <Subhazard> Gmod is a severe pain in the ass sometimes
[5:44] <SuperLlama> yeah
[5:44] <SuperLlama> I didn't notice that
[5:44] <Nihil> Pl0x: also lol 12-hour time
[5:44] <Subhazard> but the minimods are so worth it
[5:44] <SuperLlama> I use UDK :3
[5:44] * Chemo (a@116.50.156.20) has joined #minecraft

[5:44] * Superwafflez (superwaffl@202.81.69.153) has joined #minecraft

[5:45] <Subhazard> Trouble in Terrorist Town is fantastic, it's like Clue with guns.
[5:45] <Subhazard> So much paranoia
[5:45] <Subhazard> So much panic
[5:45] <SuperLlama> lol
[5:45] <SuperLlama> yeah
[5:45] <SuperLlama> sounds like a lot of fun
[5:45] <EmpiresBane> i've never got on a TiTT server that worked...
[5:45] <SuperLlama> I was one of the noobs behind "Warmod"
[5:45] <Subhazard> So many accusations being thrown around 'HES THE TRAITOR!' 'NO IM NOT I KILLED A TRAITOR!' 'SHOOT HIM HE HAS A KNIFE!'

[5:45] <Nihil> It was [iCZ]css_pwner47~ in the 47th small random building with the M249?
[5:45] <Subhazard> I made a couple maps for the Stranded mod when it first came out.
[5:46] <Subhazard> Gmod Survival, rather
[5:46] <Nihil> SuperLlama: yeah, never heard of it
[5:46] <Nihil> GMod Stranded is awesome
[5:46] * Superwafflez (superwaffl@202.81.69.153) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[5:46] <Subhazard> They aren't in rotation anymore because they're horribly out dated.
[5:46] <SuperLlama> it's an RTSFPS
[5:46] <Nihil> (and yes, it is called stranded, not survival)
[5:46] <Subhazard> If you ever come across GMS_Desperation, t hat map is mine.
[5:46] <Nihil> I can't remember the good maps

[5:46] <Nihil> Have any of you ever played Stranded II?
[5:46] <Subhazard> Stranded II?
[5:46] <Nihil> (the game gmstranded is based on)
[5:46] <Subhazard> Oh, no.
[5:47] <Nihil> http://www.stranded.unrealsoftware.de/s2_infos.php
[5:47] <Nihil> it's pretty fun
[5:47] <Nihil> crafting is a lot better than in gm_stranded
[5:47] <Subhazard> My new suggestion thread, Motion Detectors, Wired Lights, and Wireless Signals: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=18250

[5:48] <Nihil> and it'd go excellently with your suggestions
[5:49] <Nihil> GMP: no, but as long as you have the fog turned up and the graphics turned down, i can't imagine it'd have too much trouble
[5:49] <geraldbrent> GMP i have
[5:49] <Subhazard> Like, a prism system Nihil?
[5:49] <Chemo> i created dildo island on minecraft
[5:49] <geraldbrent> and am rite now
[5:49] <Chemo> its awesome
[5:49] <GMP> I'm getting 7fps atm
[5:49] <SuperLlama> I've played Stranded II
[5:49] <SuperLlama> it's fun
[5:49] <GMP> any way to get an increase? :P
[5:49] <SuperLlama> graphics are dumb though
[5:49] <geraldbrent> my eeepc is modded
[5:49] <SuperLlama> the terrain is nice
[5:49] <Nihil> yeah, Subhazard
[5:49] <SuperLlama> but the npcs are idiotic looking
[5:49] <Nihil> beam splitters and mirrors and things
[5:49] <Shinki> can you not build below the bottom floor?
[5:49] <Subhazard> Makes me think of Command and Conquer
[5:49] <Subhazard> Red Alert 2
[5:49] <SuperLlama> I'm not one to care about graphisc though
[5:49] <Nihil> how so? i never played that
[5:50] <SuperLlama> I play dwarf fortress and minecraft :P
[5:50] <Subhazard> They had prism towers
[5:50] <SuperLlama> I used to play C&C RA2
[5:50] <Subhazard> Giant towers that would synch up and use light to fry people isntantly
[5:50] <Nihil> That let you do wiring and stuff?
[5:50] <SuperLlama> good RTS
[5:50] <Nihil> oh, awesome
[5:50] <Nihil> PHOTON TORPEDOES
[5:50] <VurtualRuler98> I heard a word starting with A

[6:25] <pyrosshade> ONLY eight?
[6:25] <Kokopure> only eight in a stack
[6:26] <pyrosshade> that SUCKS
[6:26] <VurtualRuler98> start a petition for notch to immediately implement lua modding
[6:26] <Chemo> VurtualRuler98: go to six flags!
[6:26] <Kokopure> and you can only get snowballs from using a shovel on snow.
[6:26] <Kokopure> no more fisting snow into a snowball.
[6:26] <pyrosshade> it should be at least ten
[6:26] <VurtualRuler98> or we all leave

[6:51] <McC1oud> i get it to work i just dont understand
[6:52] <McC1oud> i wanna build a radio tower whith blinking lights on top
[6:52] <Wervyn> It's an unbalanced cycle.
[6:52] <Wervyn> Switch 1 connected to 2, 3, 4, 5. You turn switch 1 on and that causes switch 2 to turn off.
[6:52] <Wervyn> Which causes 3 to turn on, which causes 4 to turn off, which causes 5 to turn on, which causes 1 to turn off.
[6:53] <Conundrumer> aha, i found you
[6:53] <Wervyn> I wasn't hiding. What's up?
[6:53] <Conundrumer> i failed to convince notch to make it easier to work with redstone circuits
[6:53] <McC1oud> thnx, i kinda got a better understanding now

[6:54] <Wervyn> I don't know what the line to that guy is. I'd try to make the case personally but I'd need to talk to him first.
[6:54] <McC1oud> lever
[6:54] <Conundrumer> he responds to emails, but it takes a while
[6:54] <Wervyn> And yeah, that was my issue.

[6:55] <Jat> the logic system looks like it kinda sucks
[6:55] <Jat> is it just me?
[6:55] <McC1oud> Is it possible to get spawners that spawn creepers?
[6:55] <raquzzic> yes
[6:55] <Wervyn> It's very rudimentary, you're basically building with raw transistors.
[6:55] <Conundrumer> so instead, i'm thinking about creating either a 6 bit typer+monitor, or a 2,3 turing machine
[6:55] <raquzzic> i found spider ones
[6:56] <McC1oud> i found a spider 1 too
[6:56] <McC1oud> it turned into pigs above ground
[6:56] <Wervyn> Which is cool. But then it's made so that it doesn't work the way you'd expect it to in a lot of cases.
[6:56] <Jat> well i just mean that its a huge pain in the ass to do anything more than something very simple
[6:56] <Wervyn> I wouldn't care about this so much if Notch hadn't specifically made the rather disengenuous assertion that he made it that way in order to make things more intuitive.
[6:57] <Jat> also that it takes up tons of space and resources
[6:57] <Jat> and time
[6:57] <raquzzic> Im trying to make a ruins into a death trap

[6:59] <raquzzic> (by making a gate infront of the spawner, were it piles up in spiders, then using water flow to destroy torches! Guess what happens to those infront of the gate...)
[6:59] <Conundrumer> notch said that he didn't want to put an emphasis on circuits, so he's practically discouraging people from making complex stuff too often
[6:59] <McC1oud> should make it so if you right click a wire it brings up a 3x3 square to route the wires
[6:59] <raquzzic> they will figure it out....
[6:59] <Wervyn> Aha.
[6:59] <Conundrumer> by making it difficult to build. but of course, he expects the few crazy people with too much time to make complex stuff
[6:59] <McC1oud> like the build menu
[6:59] <raquzzic> correct
[6:59] <Wervyn> So it really is a case of "these were too easy to use before, let's make them harder."
[7:00] <vede> It's not even that hard to use.
[7:00] <Conundrumer> more like more tedious
[7:00] <McC1oud> like the game pipeline
[7:00] <raquzzic> i bet notch may do the same stuff with mega monsters, constantly buff them until people start whining about them...

[7:08] <Visiiri> Coding = fun
[7:08] <EmpiresBane> he said he was having fun earlier, though
[7:08] <Visiiri> Troubleshooting = not fun
[7:09] <EmpiresBane> that's not always true
[7:09] <Visiiri> Well, I suppose you're right.
[7:09] <EmpiresBane> it is with shotgun debugging and hilarious bugs
[7:09] <alphaq> /msg NickServ AUTH 313336625
[7:09] <vede> Visiiri, if Minecraft were finished and all the work he did was bugfixes, I'd agree with you.
[7:09] <alphaq> *sigh*
[7:09] <raquzzic> wonder what mega monsters he plans to make... I hope for titans
[7:09] <alphaq> sorry, typing error
[7:09] <vede> But Notch is working new features, like, all the time.

[7:10] <EmpiresBane> the thing ran to the teleporter nearest you and teleported away

[7:11] <Visiiri> So when she would learn things, she would stop learning similar things

[8:18] <VurtualRuler98> and repeat the same area
[8:18] <Torex> This place doesn't seem that bad.
[8:18] <VurtualRuler98> though an inventory system means I can use up some of my ridiculous stashes of some item and just breeze through
[8:18] <LG_Legacy> Hearing rumours about assholes and idiots in here Torex?
[8:18] <Torex> Totally.
[8:18] <Torex> How you had, like, three communities invade you.
[8:18] <Torex> And how IRC is awful.

[8:20] <Animator> He is correct, I know him.
[8:20] <Torex> He was talking about how bad IRC is, so I came here to check it out.
[8:20] <sorre> there are some "special" people here
[8:20] <Torex> You filthy, rotten liar, you.
[8:20] <sorre> but they're not too bad
[8:20] <sorre> if they get too noisy, the regulars entertain themselves by trolling them
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> or by pointing out their flaws
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> which is like trolling
[8:21] <LG_Legacy> It gets bad sometimes.
[8:21] <sorre> or a little bit of both
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> except entirely true
[8:21] <LG_Legacy> Like Chemo for instance.
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> but still trolling :D
[8:21] <Torex> Cool.
[8:21] <EmpiresBane> lol
[8:21] <sorre> it doesn't have to be false to be trolling
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> so, recently, an enemy in Deus Ex has been one-hitting me
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> like, how snipers can sometimes headshot you ridiculously
[8:21] <EmpiresBane> i can't pay attention...
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> one enemy has luckily been hitting me
[8:21] <sorre> pointing out things that are true in an inflammatory manner is still trolling
[8:21] <Torex> I'm just used to only, like, 30 people being on IRC at once.
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> and then hitting me instantly to death
[8:21] <Torex> Seeing 190 is making me feel inadequate.
[8:21] <VurtualRuler98> we normally get like 200+
[8:22] <Torex> Damn.

[19:07] <VurtualRuler98> Most all of my dreams can generally be summed up as either one of two things:
[19:08] <Visiiri> The only reason there is a difference between dream and reality is because your brain fills in the blanks
[19:08] <visiON> you remember everything in 99999p quality
[19:08] <VurtualRuler98> One, taking place in some kind of weird characterization of the real world, which doesn't change
[19:08] <visiON> you just cant retrieve it
[19:08] <VurtualRuler98> Or two:
[19:08] <visiON> unless in super deep sleep
[19:08] <VurtualRuler98> Being a few seconds of real life that I can remember, that hasn't happened yet.
[19:08] <Shrub> most of my dreams involve this girl I know :(
[19:08] <visiON> also hypnotize
[19:08] <Visiiri> Not QUALITY
[19:08] <Visiiri> detail
[19:08] <VurtualRuler98> It's often that I don't remember these very well(I just don't think about them) after I get up, but not always.
[19:08] <visiON> perfect clarity
[19:08] <Visiiri> You don't understand.
[19:08] <Visiiri> Let's try one more time.
[19:09] <visiON> you remembere EVERYTHING in perfect detail
[19:09] <Visiiri> ...no.
[19:09] <VurtualRuler98> The end result means, occasionally, I can tell people what they're going to say.

[19:09] <Shrub> I don't understand what's up with that

[19:09] <visiON> I remember everything from the day when my dad died, like.. everything, and it was 10 years ago
[19:10] <Visiiri> What the fuck
[19:10] <Shrub> Wait
[19:10] <Visiiri> that doesn't fucking matter
[19:10] <Shrub> maybe we're nerds
[19:10] <visiON> does
[19:10] <Shrub> because we CAN see the future
[19:10] <VurtualRuler98> supernerds.
[19:10] <visiON> you're saying
[19:10] <Visiiri> Do you know what the word DETAIL means
[19:10] <visiON> you dont remember
[19:10] <visiON> in detail
[19:10] <visiON> i do

[19:10] <Visiiri> we're talking about DREAMING
[19:10] <Shrub> I dream in epic detail
[19:10] <visiON> so
[19:10] <VurtualRuler98> Do you have these dreams of the future?
[19:10] <visiON> you're syaing
[19:10] <Visiiri> So, if you dream you wake up
[19:10] <visiON> you cant access memories
[19:10] <visiON> while awake
[19:10] <visiON> i mean
[19:10] <Visiiri> as you said
[19:10] <Shrub> I do :X
[19:10] <visiON> while dreaming
[19:10] <Visiiri> you WOULDN'T be recalling a traumatic event
[19:10] <VurtualRuler98> Sometimes I have dreams of immense detail.
[19:10] <visiON> you're saying you cant access memories while dreaming
[19:10] <Visiiri> And your detail would be minimal.
[19:10] <lily_White> fucking creeper snuck up on me and destroyed half my treasure chests full of sand. X_X
[19:10] <visiON> thats what you're saying
[19:11] <VurtualRuler98> If I think about it when I'm awake, there's always exact details, that almost never change.
[19:11] <Shrub> I had a dream where I was digging through sand
[19:11] <VurtualRuler98> Unless a door were to be opened.
[19:11] <Shrub> and all the sand was all the pretty colours
[19:11] <Visiiri> No.
[19:11] <Shrub> and I ate some sand
[19:11] <VurtualRuler98> It's very deja-vu like and confusing at times, because I'm never sure if I've seen an area before, or just never went there.
[19:11] <Visiiri> I'm saying that you do not remember things in high detail.
[19:11] <VurtualRuler98> Of course somehow my house is in the middle of the dungeons of doom?
[19:11] <Visiiri> You remember what an object looks like
[19:11] <Shrub> what vurt?
[19:12] <VurtualRuler98> Yeah, I had a dream where me, my brother, and a friend or two(the latter four being one person?)
[19:12] <VurtualRuler98> were in the dungeons of doom, nethack and whatnot
[19:12] <Visiiri> but the glass on your table- you wouldn't be able to dream about the reflective properties, most likely, unless you're around that glass alot and know how it works.
[19:12] <VurtualRuler98> but somehow we ended up... in my basement?
[19:12] <VurtualRuler98> And it might've been a house-sized mimic

[19:44] <VurtualRuler98> Vic, what
[19:44] <VurtualRuler98> run over pedestrians all day?
[19:44] <Vic> ...why would you do this
[19:44] <Visiiri> GTA = plot
[19:44] <Visiiri> JC2 = not plot
[19:44] <VurtualRuler98> Because at least 80% of the time it's entirely fun
[19:44] <Vic> no you misunderstood me
[19:44] <VurtualRuler98> then 20% of the time you're forced to kill someone
[19:44] <Diablodoct0r> You play GTA because you like doing bike stunts
[19:44] <Diablodoct0r> But GTASA was better for that
[19:44] <Vic> it's like
[19:44] <VurtualRuler98> Want to go bowling, cousin?

[19:53] <Aeomin> depends on the emulator, if you use one of those requires firmware then it's emulation

[20:20] <Shrub74> and because it was awesome.
[20:20] <Bodie> the 2nd and 3rd are there to compliment the first
[20:21] <Shrub74> And it had that epic scene...
[20:21] <Bodie> to feed our wish for more matrix story :D
[20:21] <Shrub74> "Please remove all metal objects from your... HOLY SHIT"
[20:21] <Bodie> they could make films of the previous 'ones'
[20:21] <Bodie> maybe comics
[20:21] <Shrub74> I think they should remake the first one, 20 times

[21:23] <Quatroking> open up your world in nbtedit
[21:24] <Bodie> <visiON> havent tooken dump in 3 days
[21:24] <Kizzycocoa> but, that doesn't REMOVE snow D:!
[21:24] <Bodie> definitely not a girl
[21:24] <Quatroking> and change snowcovered from 1 to 0
[21:24] <Bodie> lol
[21:24] <Kizzycocoa> but, that doesn't REMOVE snow D:
[21:24] <Kizzycocoa> I have a snow level
[21:24] <Quatroking> oh that
[21:24] <Quatroking> shovels
[21:24] <Kizzycocoa> but, it now has snow with no snow on
[21:24] <Bodie> :P
[21:24] <VurtualRuler98> so guys I had an idea.
[21:24] <Kizzycocoa> and the sea is 1/2 ice
[21:24] <Kizzycocoa> it looks messy
[21:24] <VurtualRuler98> We get someone really smart running for president
[21:24] <VurtualRuler98> absurdly so, and nerdy
[21:24] <Quatroking> then turn snow on
[21:25] <VurtualRuler98> then, since by the time we can do this, most gamer-types will be 18 or older
[21:25] <Kizzycocoa> snow lags. I just wanted to get snowballs
[21:25] <VurtualRuler98> we can get an absurd amount of votes

[21:30] <Kizzycocoa> ah, thanks!
[21:30] <JonasQ> I think more games should have friggin huge maps like Bad Company 2 does.
[21:30] <JonasQ> :\
[21:31] <Kizzycocoa> replacing ice with still water
[21:31] <VurtualRuler98> no
[21:31] <Kizzycocoa> :P
[21:31] <Nihil> actually i think it's only still water that can be picked up
[21:31] <Nihil> actually i'm not sure
[21:31] <Kizzycocoa> and snow with air
[21:31] <Nihil> yeah, ice to stillwater's a better idea
[21:31] <VurtualRuler98> Just, like, how hl2 used to have one road
[21:31] <Bodie> does anyone else think it looks silly with the block in the player's hand?

[21:31] <melibe> Can anyone else connect to RIZON server?
[21:31] <Kizzycocoa> it didn't remove it
[21:32] <VurtualRuler98> hl2 has official multiplayer
[21:32] <VurtualRuler98> hl2dm
[21:32] <melibe> this is a big problem
[21:32] <Nihil> yeah, it doesn't remove the snow, it removes the snownig

[21:48] <visiON> so the smoke will go inside
[21:48] <JonasQ> I'll just stick with my saddle, pig and ice.
[21:48] <JonasQ> :\
[21:48] <Quatroking> I'm on peaceful mode, because I'm a fag, and besides even if creepers did came, well
[21:48] <visiON> when i smoke thru window
[21:49] <Quatroking> the waterflow is effing strong
[21:49] <Diablodoct0r> Yes it is. In 2004 it was enhanced with pixie dust in the muzzle.
[21:49] <Diablodoct0r> duh.
[21:49] <ZomBuster> mobs are too good swimmers
[21:49] <VurtualRuler98> taking a marginally better gun and smacking an elephant in a hummer on it won't make it better than the original

[21:49] <JonasQ> I actually cornered off a large ocean.
[21:49] <JonasQ> So I could ride around it on my pig.

[22:17] <Bodie> i think that if you can have claimed areas, that other people can't destroy blocks/build in then chests shouldn't be lockable

[22:18] <VurtualRuler98> no claimed areas
[22:18] <VurtualRuler98> Notch said no to those at one point
[22:18] <VurtualRuler98> and I'm still saying no.
[22:18] <Bodie> he mentioned them the other day
[22:18] <Xymostech> Nukleah, probably because people were abusing them?
[22:18] <Bodie> flags
[22:18] <mloc|SS13> As am
[22:18] <GothikCheese> I thought he metioned that on the blog though
[22:18] <mloc|SS13> I
[22:18] <VurtualRuler98> then Notch is going to have a little accident.
[22:18] <Varriount> www.livestream.com/torg to see him jump out of minecraft.
[22:18] <Ukyo> pig spawners. Working for mcdonalds since minecraft
[22:18] <Nukleahboy> Ah, I must have missed it
[22:18] <Helar> he mentioned craftable land claim flags
[22:18] <Sord213> hahaha
[22:18] <GothikCheese> Lol
[22:18] <Nukleahboy> Still, I like pig spawners.
[22:18] <Bodie> he said it when he was in here the other day
[22:18] <Writer> I am so glad that I water bucket harvested six billion piles of snow cubes before Notch made it shovel only
[22:18] <Sord213> Wait
[22:18] <Xymostech> I like them too
[22:18] <Rooster> blah blah blah Land-Claim Flags will ruin the game.
[22:18] <Sord213> McDonalds uses pigs?
[22:18] <Sord213> I thought their meat was factory made..
[22:18] <Ukyo> also, fond a creeper spawner yesterday. Thought it was not possible according to the wiki
[22:18] <GothikCheese> He said something like, you cant mine a block in land you dont have permission to, or something
[22:19] <Ukyo> found*
[22:19] <GothikCheese> Lol
[22:19] <GothikCheese> Kill it?
[22:19] <Nukleahboy> I still have a 9 stack in my inventory
[22:19] <Nukleahboy> I am never using it

[22:19] <GothikCheese> Or turn it into a gunpowder farm?

[22:20] <VurtualRuler98> then someone gave me the ability to play indev and I was like "k"
[22:21] <VurtualRuler98> and now the game suuucks
[22:21] <Ukyo> I have to admit, at first I hated minecraft because I was all into infiniminer
[22:21] <Kokopure> I bought it before any sort of custom indev maps, actually

[22:21] <Sord213> :3
[22:21] <Vic> yeah but then there's this clone of minecraft
[22:21] <Phil> is vede in here?
[22:21] <Diablodoct0r> But apparently it's good
[22:21] <Writer> Oh whoa wait what is this
[22:21] <Diablodoct0r> .
[22:21] <Kokopure> Minecraft has achieved more than a lot of professional games with real budgets behind them :|
[22:21] <Vic> that doesnt fuck around
[22:21] <Kokopure> seriously.
[22:21] <TheCactusman> Infiniminer is abandoned.
[22:21] <Writer> Snowballs are now limited to stacks of eight?
[22:21] <Nukleahboy> You know, impenetrable fortresses sort of defeat the purpose of monsters
[22:21] <VurtualRuler98> now since it was fun for fifteen minutes every "HURR INDIE" hippie is waving their erection around like it's the second coming, and since they refuse to play normal games, it's all they play.
[22:21] <Vic> it just says "yeah it's a clone"
[22:21] <Nukleahboy> There should be one that can break walls or climb towers
[22:21] <Diablodoct0r> Koko: Lies
[22:21] <VurtualRuler98> and then whenever I speak badly of it, it'd be worse than my mom finding out I have Twilight Princess.
[22:21] <Diablodoct0r> Minecraft is lousy
[22:22] <Diablodoct0r> Noone plays it
[22:22] <Diablodoct0r> <3
[22:22] <Ukyo> but, well. Now minecraft has caves. Has a crafting sistem. Heck, we'll probably have coal-alimented trains (I hope) in the future. Best sandbox ever.
[22:22] <Kokopure> this is better and costs less than like 75% of games in my console library.

[22:27] <Snowman> It's snow!
[22:27] <VurtualRuler98> is he gone yet?
[22:27] <Diablodoct0r> oo
[22:27] <Snowman> Oh, wait...
[22:27] <Ukyo> also, I love the cave-generator. I love exploring caves so much that actually I don't remember even seeing the light of the sun. I cut down 30 trees, got enough wood and then started exploring the underground. The tunnel is pretty long now, I'm wondering how far I've gone
[22:27] <Diablodoct0r> He stopped spamming
[22:27] <Snowman> It's Snowmen ofc.
[22:27] <visiON> why cant i go to store without shirt :( its so damn hot
[22:27] <Quatroking> the cave generator is amazing
[22:27] <Diablodoct0r> Yeah
[22:27] <Helar> you can
[22:27] <Nukleahboy> biomes are different environments in one map
[22:27] <Diablodoct0r> I really don't find my way back out
[22:27] <Nukleahboy> or one world
[22:27] <CptnWaffles> Would be nice to have a pedometer, tell us how many steps we've taken xD
[22:27] <Nukleahboy> I'd like to see that
[22:27] <visiON> a

[22:27] <dude123456789> ...
[22:27] <dude123456789> so would i

[22:27] <Helar> men go to the store without a shirt so why cant girls?
[22:27] <Diablodoct0r> pedometer?
[22:27] <Nukleahboy> Like, 1/4th of a map is snow
[22:27] <Quatroking> a pedometer would be nice, yes

[22:28] <Diablodoct0r> Notch should make Pedobear a rare character in-game, like the G-man in HL2
[22:28] <Diablodoct0r> :D
[22:28] <Quatroking> I once replaced the moon texture with a picture of pedobear
[22:28] <Ukyo> for me, minecraft as it is now is perfect. The only thing I ask, personally, would be an ingame map viewer. I can survive without it actually telling you where you are exactly, I can get it by building towers
[22:28] <Rooster> I thought pedometer meant how many steps you've tooken as a pedo
[22:28] <Kokopure> is snow supposed to collect on stair blocks?
[22:28] <visiON> im the pedobear here...
[22:28] <Nukleahboy> memes
[22:28] <Kokopure> >_>?
[22:28] <Diablodoct0r> He peeks at you from far places

[22:28] <dude123456789> XD
[22:28] <visiON> .even posted nudes of myself
[22:28] <Diablodoct0r> But disappears once you get there
[22:28] <Diablodoct0r> "Pedobear is watching you"
[22:28] <Helar> Notch will drop golden apples D:
[22:28] <Nukleahboy> stop that.

[22:29] <Rooster> Christ the forums are retarded
[22:29] <Helar> i dont think anyone can kill Notch

[22:29] <nickcwly> t*comments
[22:29] <Fordlover89> I'm older then the pedobear

[22:30] <Nukleahboy> I'd love to be in MP
[22:30] <Snowman> Next week
[22:30] <Nukleahboy> I'd love to have a nice civil talk about the game with notch
