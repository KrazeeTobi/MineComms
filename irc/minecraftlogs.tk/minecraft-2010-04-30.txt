[0:00] <pontusedberg> kinda
[0:00] <bildramer> since 90% is garbage, yeah
[0:00] <pl0x> but ED is worse.
[0:00] <pontusedberg> trolls that are makking trolls.
[0:00] <pontusedberg> brrr
[0:00] <pl0x> everyone knows that right?
[0:00] <bildramer> "Disappointing. Rule 34 is supposed to be more extreme. Maybe Liberty shoving the torch into Justice."
[0:00] <pontusedberg> I was kinda big on 4chan once.
[0:00] <Dommys> in this channel, trolls getting trolled
[0:00] <bildramer> O_o
[0:00] <Animator> Kingnerd, yes.
[0:00] <pontusedberg> I was named as "The Inventor Of Everything"
[0:01] <Slash-Caps> What are trolls? Like the mythical creautres?
[0:01] <pontusedberg> becuse i literly did invent new way of thinking..
[0:01] <Dommys> OP is a troll
[0:01] <firetempest> i visit it some times because of that "watching a train wreck" fascination.
[0:01] <pontusedberg> Griefers then?
[0:01] <pl0x> Trolls are something that you don't want to know about.
[0:01] <pontusedberg> And never speak about the trolls
[0:01] <pontusedberg> or they will come
[0:02] <pontusedberg> So how was your day? ={D
[0:02] <firetempest> I hate how trolls stole the name trolls, because i like those things. its like how gays have the rainbow. i like rainbows too dammit, now i cant.
[0:03] <Animator> AlLnAtuRalX, what do you need?
[0:03] <pontusedberg> lol
[0:03] <Slash-Caps> So trolls are like annoying people?
[0:03] <Animator> Trolls live off of the anger of people.
[0:03] <Animator> They go much farther than annoy.
[0:03] <Mithril> Is notch still coding on minecraft?
[0:03] <Animator> Yes he is.
[0:03] <Mithril> atm?
[0:03] <Animator> We don't know that far.
[0:03] <firetempest> ever hear the saying, the best bad mood is the one you spreed around?
[0:03] <Mithril> I dont mean this week, I mean now, at this moment and second and minute
[0:04] <bildramer> I smell troll
[0:04] <bildramer> durr

[0:04] <Animator> I'd love to get on a plane and go to Sweden and get his address and knock on his door and ask him that, but I can't.
[0:04] <Mithril> Id like to see notch some more on the IRC
[0:04] <Yourself> <Animator> I'd love to get on a plane and go to Sweden and get his address and knock on his door and ask him that, but I can't.
[0:04] <Yourself> or set up spy cameras in his apartment?
[0:04] <Animator> I'd still have to do all that I just said to set it up.
[0:04] <Yourself> yes, you would
[0:05] <Yourself> but with cameras, you could leave
[0:05] <bildramer> lol.
[0:05] <Animator> But then I could just ask him then and there.
[0:05] <Yourself> and then you could sit in your room with your shades drawn rubbing your hands manically
[0:05] <Mithril> <Animator> I'd love to get on a plane and go to Sweden and get his address and knock on his door and ask him that, but I can't. - Netherlands --> sweden shouldnt be a long plane ride. And we know the landmark he lives near. So we could find out where in sweden he exactly lives
[0:05] <bildramer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3Ir7L2mnoM
[0:05] <Yourself> knowing that you will always know exactly what he's doing
[0:05] <bildramer> we have done that
[0:05] <bildramer> lol
[0:06] <whaleboobs> Mithril, we know ehere he lives
[0:06] <Animator> The 'rubbing your hands' part worries me.
[0:06] <bildramer> "pretty close" he said
[0:06] <pl0x> Trolls are like ninjas except you can see em.
[0:06] <bildramer> lol
[0:06] <pl0x> they're always around you.
[0:06] <whaleboobs> Notch have GPS cordinates in his pictures.
[0:06] <whaleboobs> nexux camera ;)
[0:06] <Mithril> Any in sweden could knock on his door to tell him he needs to be more on the IRC?
[0:06] <pl0x> Notch is jesus /period.
[0:06] <Siiseli> I'm home
[0:06] <firetempest> "You make me feel good inside with your games! let me touch you!"
[0:06] <bildramer> ohai

[0:07] <pl0x> !!!!
[0:07] <Mithril> Notch is Budha /period
[0:07] <bildramer> Notch is the Flying Spaghetti Monster /period.
[0:07] <Mithril> <pl0x> STOP BEING MUSLIM - you discriminate muslims?

[0:08] <Mithril> <- Atheist to the bones
[0:08] <Mithril> <pl0x> In soviet russia notch is you. - I lolled
[0:08] <pl0x> It's true.
[0:08] <firetempest> in soviet russia, you blow up creeper
[0:08] <rcfighter> I would find it slightly entertaining if Notch connected to IRC in the middle of all this, and people didn't notice
[0:08] <pl0x> No
[0:09] <bildramer> :l

[0:09] * SeanV (Mibbit@66-215-181-62.dhcp.rvsd.ca.charter.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:09] <Animator> Heheheheh. I pranked Aera with a PM regarding serious forum issues so he'd respond faster with a birthday greeting for the message.
[0:09] <Animator> He thought it was an actual forum problem.
[0:09] <pl0x> Notch is here?
[0:09] <Animator> No.
[0:09] * pl0x hides.
[0:09] <firetempest> plox, that already happens
[0:09] <pl0x> ahk
[0:10] <bildramer> wtf is Notch doing?

[0:10] <bildramer> 4 hours ago he tweeted
[0:11] <bildramer> why won't he idle in IRC? :|
[0:11] <Animator> IRC could distract him.
[0:11] <bildramer> I know
[0:11] <firetempest> so people can keep going "are you here yet notch!?" no, i dont want him to idle
[0:11] <bildramer> we can wait
[0:11] <rcfighter> Maybe he wants to just code,and not get mass highlighted by random people. Ever consider that?
[0:11] <bildramer> I'm patient unlike most
[0:11] <Mithril> <rcfighter> Probably coding - I would be mad if he was doing certain stuff with his gf
[0:11] <bildramer> lol
[0:11] <SeanV> NO SEX
[0:11] <SeanV> ONLY MINECRAFT
[0:11] <Animator> ...
[0:11] * rcfighter slaps SeanV
[0:11] <bildramer> YESSIR
[0:12] <firetempest> its a side project called sexcraft
[0:12] <Animator> Notch can have sex. Give him that pleasure.
[0:12] <SeanV> cmon that's the joke
[0:12] <Animator> NOT LITERALLY.
[0:12] <rbos> Mithril: it's a little distracting when you paste like that. Can you just do something like say the person's name, then give the response? eg, "rcfighter: blah blah blah"
[0:12] <rcfighter> Heh.
[0:12] <Mithril> No, this is the way I do it on every other channel
[0:12] <Animator> I mean yeah, poor Notch, if he wants to get laid, let him get laid.
[0:12] <Mithril> and everyone on those channels does it this way
[0:13] <Mithril> lol, this discussion just derailed in notch getting laid
[0:13] <rbos> Mithril: That's a weird convention; I've never seen it done that way before. And I've been using IRC since 1997.
[0:13] <Animator> I've seen it done.
[0:13] <whaleboobs> Is minecraft made with the same engine as infiniminer?
[0:13] <bildramer> 1997
[0:13] <Animator> Varies in communty, though.
[0:13] <Mithril> Ive seen it quite a lot on EFnet
[0:13] <bildramer> I was 2 yarrs old
[0:13] <Animator> Whaleboobs, no.

[0:14] <rbos> Anyway, I try to follow the conventions of whatever channel I'm in. :) Though obviously I draw the line at lolspeak. :P
[0:14] <Mithril> 16 isnt young in the Netherlands, if your that old it means: Beer ,weed and getting laid
[0:14] <bildramer> you're
[0:15] * rbos 's 31 as of last month.

[0:16] <Animator> I'm 15.

[0:16] * Quatroking is searching loopy music to animate on

[0:17] <Dommys> I have a friend who started thinning at 14
[0:17] <rbos> My uncle went bald at 18. :/
[0:17] <Dommys> And was damned near bald at 18
[0:17] <Dommys> His hair was fine untill he died it black
[0:17] <Dommys> Guess fate gave him a reason to be gothic and depressed.
[0:18] <Dommys> Dyed*
[0:18] <Speljohan_> lold
[0:18] <firetempest> ive had some grey in my sideburns since elementary. if my dads any indication. I will be very silver at 50
[0:18] <rbos> That's cool. :D
[0:18] <Speljohan_> quite an old dad
[0:18] <Animator> He was like, "Goddamnit, I hate life and everything." And fate was like, "FUCK YOU I'M GIVING YOU A REASON TO HATE LIFE YOU FUCKER."
[0:18] <Animator> And he went bald.
[0:19] <Bomb_Spammer> Sounds charming
[0:19] <firetempest> hes not that old when you think of his youngest son being 28
[0:19] <rbos> anyone who's 15 right now will probably be able to just get their hair reconstructed with nanite tetryon particle beams or something

[0:20] <Speljohan_> funny firetempest, my great grandmother is younger than that
[0:21] <pl0x> thats why I'm pointing this out.

[3:04] <ILM> nothing that fancy, but it was nice
[3:04] <Eagle> back when the channel had like 20 people in it
[3:04] <vede> Indeed.
[3:04] <LuciferZ> It's widely accepted as one.
[3:04] <Quatroking> blaster do you have any work
[3:04] <Eagle> and they all talked about nonstupid stuff
[3:04] <Quatroking> flash stuff
[3:04] <ILM> >>Total of 166 nicks
[3:04] <SeanV> what was your method ILM?
[3:04] <Eagle> and notch frequented it kinda sorta
[3:04] <Nyarlathotep> So does notch have an ETA on multiplayer survival?

[3:05] <Eagle> NO
[3:05] <Eagle> AUGH
[3:05] <SeanV> hahaha

[3:06] <ILM> apparently the same doesn't work on infdev due to physics
[3:06] <ILM> =/
[3:06] <MarkTraceur> That was an epic Munchkins reference
[3:06] <SeanV> yeah I wish infdev was closer to completion
[3:06] <SeanV> I just want caves man.....
[3:06] <ILM> yeah, I could cave for miles and miles and miles
[3:06] <SeanV> seriouslylyyyyy
[3:06] <ILM> also save sharing
[3:06] <SeanV> on a huge inland map I spent something like 8 hours straight digging down in caves
[3:07] <SeanV> I would host a server day one
[3:07] <SeanV> but it'd probably only be for me and my gf
[3:07] <SeanV> we're gonna be all sappy and build a little love hut
[3:07] <ILM> SeanV: what happens when you two hit lava due to one person's mistake
[3:07] <ILM> Relationship failure?
[3:07] <ILM> also http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l0jaf4Qx7k1qaf9alo1_500.jpg

[3:09] <ILM> that sucks
[3:09] <Dommys> Dress in fursuits like 90% of the rest of second life
[3:09] <SeanV> yeah secondlife has no gameplay it's just fucking animations
[3:10] <Dommys> Or you already been there done that?
[3:10] <blaster> just fucking fuck
[3:10] <ILM> back in the day I lived right down the road from my girlfriend. We pretty much lived together in my attic.
[3:10] <SeanV> plus we both have school so we can prett much see each other only on weekends
[3:10] <ILM> then she moved to arizona or some shit.
[3:10] * SpaceManiac can't follow the conversation :P
[3:10] <SeanV> I went to school in another city so I never had a close girlfriend
[3:10] <blaster> Secondlife sounds like omegle
[3:10] <ILM> SeanV: that's unfortunate.
[3:10] <SeanV> always at least 30 minutes away... which is wierd when you think about it
[3:10] <ILM> yeah, it is.
[3:10] <Dommys> blaster, it is, except you create an "avatar" and use it to chat.
[3:10] <Dommys> and perform sex animations on other peoples avatars
[3:10] <ILM> and by chat you mean simulate sex/
[3:11] <SeanV> oh I had two girlfriends who lived in the same city but they were ugly and crazy lol
[3:11] <ILM> aw, you beat me to it.
[3:11] <blaster> Dommys Blaster is is except you create an avatar and use it to rape
[3:11] <ILM> SeanV: that is a bad combination.
[3:11] <blaster> SeanV did you get raped on second life?
[3:11] <SeanV> if I played second life I'd be one of those guys who spams floating penises that crash people's computers
[3:11] <SeanV> nah I only played second life for a few hours and got bored

[3:11] <SeanV> if I really want to socialize--which I don't-- I can go to a club
[3:12] <blaster> Wasnt there this object which could duplicate itself and it took over the whole game
[3:12] <SeanV> no my gf's never played escondlife
[3:12] <Dommys> If so, she's not your girlfriend. she's an internet whore.
[3:12] <SeanV> hahhaa
[3:12] <SeanV> we'd play tf2 together but she's got a fucking mac
[3:12] <Dommys> lolmac
[3:12] <SeanV> I knowwwwww
[3:12] <ILM> SeanV: get her wine
[3:12] <Dommys> Go get her wine/bootcamp
[3:12] <ILM> If that's out for macs
[3:12] <Dommys> And set it up
[3:12] <SeanV> tried wine, can't run tf2 on it
[3:12] <ILM> try bootcamp
[3:12] <SeanV> she'll be doing bootcamp as soon as she gets somebody to reinstall the OS
[3:13] <Dommys> somebody
[3:13] <Dommys> Other than you
[3:13] <SeanV> but she doesn't know how, I don't wanna bother with macs
[3:13] <ILM> get her to install linux if she's installing an OS
[3:13] <SeanV> she'll ask her school to do it but she's really busy with shit right now
[3:13] <Dommys> Fuck that, you'll let another man put his hands on her computer? you might aswell let him put his dick in her mouth
[3:13] <ILM> I would never let anyone touch my computer
[3:13] <SeanV> hahaha where does that connection come in anyway?
[3:13] <SeanV> her school has a little tech center they know more about macs than she does
[3:13] <ILM> SeanV: people store a surprisingly large amount of personal things on their computers.
[3:14] <ILM> Personally I think linux is a far better os
[3:14] <ILM> well, ArchLinux or Slackware or, hell, even the shitfest that is Gentoo

[3:14] <Dommys> Except the nudie pictures
[3:14] <SeanV> well there are a few of those I guess
[3:15] <ILM> if they find them they might give her a discount

[3:15] <Dommys> *.bmp *.png
[3:15] <Dommys> Oh she's going to format it first?
[3:15] <ILM> that's a shame
[3:15] <Dommys> Well I've got about a hundred apps on a linux boot cd that can recover from a formatted partition
[3:16] <Dommys> And I'm willing to bet College Techs do too
[3:16] * Codlike_ is now known as Codlike
[3:16] <TestDummy> Doo too what?
[3:16] <ILM> If I was sad enough to work in a tech center cubicle, the only thing good in my life would probably the occasional nudie pic
[3:16] <ILM> she would rob them of that?
[3:16] <SeanV> I would work in geek squad just for the nudes
[3:16] <SeanV> no I don't mean format
[3:16] <Dommys> seriosly, what do you think the site Anonib is for
[3:17] <SeanV> I mean that shit that wipes it with random data 7 times
[3:17] <Dommys> Dumping those picutre syou found
[3:17] <ILM> SeanV: that is pointless
[3:17] <ILM> Gutman really just wears out HDDs
[3:17] <SeanV> well then who fucking cares if they see her nudes?
[3:17] <ILM> dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda1 gets the job done
[3:17] <Dommys> SeanV, because then they email her with a few of them
[3:18] <Dommys> And say they're going on the internet if she doesn't Suck it.
[3:18] <Dommys> And she doesn't want to tell you
[3:18] <SeanV> hahaha what blackmail? hahahahhaha
[3:18] <Dommys> So she does.
[3:18] <SeanV> HAHA
[3:18] <Dommys> Suck it, that is
[3:18] <ILM> SeanV: that stuff works, but it seriously decreases the life of a harddrive
[3:18] <Dommys> And then she realizes that she likes it
[3:18] <ILM> better to just zero it with dd
[3:18] <SeanV> she does like it
[3:18] <Dommys> And she still doesn't tell you
[3:18] <Dommys> And just keeps Sucking it.
[3:18] <Dommys> And then she starts just Sucking any dick that comes within reach
[3:18] <vede> Sucking it. With a capital Suck.
[3:18] <Dommys> And then you wake up with a sore.
[3:19] <Dommys> Enjoy that.
[3:19] <Dommys> Learn to fix her Mac, or get Herpes
[3:19] <ILM> or she might just ignore them
[3:19] <Dommys> Your choice
[3:19] <SeanV> dommys maybe you should get yourself tested before you blackmail my girlfriend ok?
[3:19] <vede> Not wiping HD -> herpes
[3:19] <Dommys> She's not my girlfriend, why do I care if I give her, you and every other guy Herpes
[3:19] <vede> Fascinating path, Dommys.
[3:19] <Dommys> This is all completely logical.
[3:19] <Dommys> bede understands.
[3:20] <Dommys> vede*
[3:20] <vede> He *is* right, though, SeanV.
[3:20] <SeanV> hahaha
[3:20] <Dommys> Just google "reinstall snowleopard, with bootcamp" and you'll be set.
[3:20] <SeanV> yeah i'm doing that right now lol
[3:20] <Dommys> Good man.
[3:20] <vede> And fuck, those weirdo tech center guys might have all kinds of strange, undiscovered diseases.
[3:21] <SeanV> unlikely as that all sounds, she hasn't gotten around to taking it to the techs in something like a year
[3:21] <vede> You don't want to start the next Black Death, do you, SeanV?
[3:21] <Dommys> Either learn this, or start googling "discount Valtrex perscription"
[3:21] <Cial> ahh the plague
[3:22] <SeanV> honestly I don't get any good results googling "reinstall snowleopard, with bootcamp"
[3:23] <SeanV> do I reinstall leopard first, then add bootcamp? or do I have to do bootcamp first?

[3:27] <SeanV> yeah she needs a mac
[3:27] <SeanV> she has a 10x10 room with no room for a dekstop

[3:28] <Shadaez> who is "she"? does she play games?
[3:28] <SeanV> "She" is my girlfriend
[3:28] <FoxtrotZero> Its critically important that we know what 'she' needs the computer for, else we don't know what in fuck she'll need.
[3:28] <Dommys> Alot of the Netbooks with Nvidia Ion have been reported to play TF2 on low decently well.
[3:28] <SeanV> she won't be playing crysis but a little bit of TF2, L4D, and Project64
[3:29] <SeanV> but she doesn't have the money to just buy a laptop willy nilly

[3:29] <SeanV> but it cost $200 so I'm not complaining
[3:29] <Shadaez> Dommys: I bet they c ould play it on High, on DX8.1.

[3:30] <SeanV> or somebody could tell me if bootcamp and osx need to be installed at the same time
[3:30] <SeanV> or if I can just do one then the other
[3:31] <Dommys> Get a second job for a month or two, to pay for your Girlfriends gaming habits, or She turns into a CockSucking Mac whore.. *shrugs*

"Yeah, adding a diamond mode would be a cool thing to add to survival."
[3:31] <Dommys> Forget bootcamp.

[3:34] <Eagle> besides the whole "was supposed to be a free addon" thing but NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THAT.
[3:34] <Iguana> Because of the end of The Passing?
[3:34] <Eagle> Also hello.
[3:34] <SeanV> l4d2 is pretty cool, the passing is cool even if the survivor thing is bullshit
[3:34] <coladash> the reason I slightly dislike l4d2 is rochelle

[3:39] <ILM> they didn't really agree with it, but since he was in charge of the team they let him do it

[3:39] <Eagle> They made parts of the engine for it, I believe
[3:39] <ILM> When valve releases portal 2 I am going to go kill whoever is in charge
[3:39] <FoxtrotZero> There are people above project lead that need to suck it up and say 'no' now and again
[3:39] <ILM> because it isn't episode 3

[3:40] <SeanV> ep3 = HL3 as far as my acronyms go
[3:40] <Eagle> I see.
[3:40] <SeanV> and yeah they've said they're working on it but they're completely silent about it
[3:40] <ILM> I don't give a shit if portal 2 is gaming fucking heaven, if it isn't ep3 then it isn't good :<
[3:40] <FoxtrotZero> Its like how Oni was the only game made by Bungie West - Valve South will never make anything except L4D and it will be shit.
[3:40] <Dommys> http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/4711/screenshot013br.jpg
[3:40] <Eagle> ILM, how about the Black Box, with Portal 2 and Episode 3 and something else
[3:40] <Eagle> Here's for hoping they make something like that
[3:40] <Eagle> :P
[3:41] <FoxtrotZero> If its L4D3, the taint will be too great do bear
[3:41] <FoxtrotZero> *to
[3:41] <ILM> Eagle: if they do I will personally suck every ceo valve has ever had off.
[3:41] <FoxtrotZero> They should give something like Portal Two, And then Episodes 1, 2, and 3, and call it the Black Box or something

[4:34] <FoxtrotZero> *than
[4:35] <Jake> which is which?
[4:35] <Jake> I play only on indev
[4:35] <FoxtrotZero> ...INF as in INFINTIY, means its bigger
[4:35] * Skynet is now known as Roujo
[4:35] <Animator> Around the world 9 times big.
[4:35] <Vis{SemiAFKlikeMAIL}> Sweet, I just found the topic of my science project!
[4:35] <Firetempest> its terrain generator is also better. it just doesn't have caves implemented yet

[4:36] <Jake> how do I play infdev?
[4:36] <FoxtrotZero> ...
[4:36] <Firetempest> its less then that really, but its still bigger then the surface area of earth. after awhile the algorithm breaks downs and its pure stone
[4:37] <FoxtrotZero> So i've heard, which really makes no sence to me

[4:39] * vLK-lol is now known as vLK
[4:39] <FoxtrotZero> It doesn't make sence to me, seeing as how, being an algorithm, it should be... constant. All you need is random inputs and you then get random outputs, to an extent.
[4:39] <FoxtrotZero> Then again, when mapping 3D, it likely works differently
[4:39] <ILM> where are infdev maps stored?
[4:39] * Jake pokes everyone
[4:39] <ILM> On windows, that is.
[4:39] <Jake> where's the infdev?
[4:40] <Jake> and how do I get all these wonderful flying hacks to work?
[4:40] <FoxtrotZero> Somewhere deep in the locked down core known as ram. Some systems give access with the elvish word for 'Friend'
[4:40] <ILM> FoxtrotZero: so in the temporary internet files?
[4:40] <FoxtrotZero> Hax only work in creative, I belive, but just the same, you need the WOM client
[4:40] <FoxtrotZero> Temporary Internet Files != RAM
[4:40] <ILM> =/
[4:41] <FoxtrotZero> However, i do not know for certain where they are stored.
[4:41] <ILM> I'm not that stupid, I know what ram is.
[4:41] <Cial> Jake, #wom for hacks
[4:41] <ILM> But I figured I would try temp files first
[4:41] <ILM> anyway, brb, windows
[4:41] <FoxtrotZero> You won't find it there, it would be in the cache i think, or maybe the cookies

[4:46] <EricJ> Good afternoon everybody
[4:47] <vede> No it doesn't.
[4:47] <SubBoy> WEll, I dual boot, built a multilib LFS system, but it doesn't play my games.
[4:47] <FoxtrotZero> Its beyond that if you ask me. I don't like the way seven displays information or tries to figure out what shit I like and what shit i don't like. I wouldn't mind a fresh coat of paint, but I like the way XP does it, and I have difficulty fathoming a better system.
[4:47] <whatdoesth> Yes, it does, WINE compatibility is pretty awful.
[4:47] <vede> I play games on Linux all the time, and I don't even have Wine installed.
[4:47] <Dommys> Foxtrot does your PC suck ass?
[4:47] <FoxtrotZero> Not really, but it sure as hell isn't top of the line
[4:47] <Dommys> That is why you don't understand the need for other OS's
[4:48] <FoxtrotZero> I've used them both extensively, and I hate the way Macs do it, and I hate the way newer generations of Windows do it.
[4:48] <SubBoy> It's true that I still recomend XP in certain cases, BUT.. not 64-bit XP. (And my linux does not yet run the games I like to play, didn't mean linux doens't run games)
[4:49] <Dommys> Win7 is fine, if you dislike the new additions, disable them
[4:49] <FoxtrotZero> Yes, well, unfortunately many things don't come straight off with Linux support
[4:49] <FoxtrotZero> Well, granted, i have not had the ability to properly tinker with Win7.
[4:49] <SubBoy> The funny thing is I know someone who felt the same way about XP and used 2000 until recently, now he feels the same way vista/7 and uses XP.

[4:49] <FoxtrotZero> None of the computers are mine.
[4:49] <Dommys> Foxtrot, honestly soon, any new hardware won't be coming with winXP support
[4:50] <Dommys> So you better get handy with hacking your own way, or get over your "I only use XP" mindset
[4:50] <Cial> i wish vista wasnt as buggy
[4:50] <FoxtrotZero> Much to my dismay, i won't be buying hardware any time soon either
[4:51] <SubBoy> I was hoping 7 was going to manage my ram better, I still need to give it a shot, but preliminary reports from someone else said it wasn't much better..
[4:51] <FoxtrotZero> If I had things my way, i would build my own computer and probably run some version of Linux
[4:51] <SubBoy> The good news is you can make a LFS linux run on any machine ever. I recomend doing it now.
[4:52] <FoxtrotZero> Not an option I have
[4:52] <SubBoy> Not.. your computer?
[4:52] <FoxtrotZero> Not technically
[4:52] <SubBoy> Ah. Yeah, if you can't make mroe partitions, then indeed it's not an option.
[4:52] <FoxtrotZero> They're incompetent with it and they can't stop me from doing much, but thats one of the things they would go apeshit over

[4:53] <SeanV> I used common sense but my computer's clock was out of date and hadn't been updated in three months so that probably caused the virus

[4:56] <FoxtrotZero> Wait, 2Ghz each?
[4:56] <Jake> yeah, I paid as soon as I'd spent a couple hours laying with it

[4:58] <Jake> aside for being huge
[4:58] <Cial> laggy and huge
[4:58] <FoxtrotZero> That makes no sence, though. If a quad core can do the same thing as a dual core, whats the point of having a core that overheats faster with almost no processing gain...

[4:59] <FoxtrotZero> Well my terms are confused then

[4:59] <Firetempest> if you want to see inf. http://www.livestream.com/thefireescape

[4:59] <DoubleS> Caves
[5:00] <FoxtrotZero> Jake, remember, those are IN DEVELOPMENT.
[5:00] <Cial> umm you can only build like 120 something up i think

[5:03] <FoxtrotZero> Not to imply you didn't know that

[5:04] <SubBoy> Amusingly, My computer is the loudest of the people I know, since I didn't care about noise, and it has... atleast 8 fans.
[5:05] <DoubleS> dieing in infdev is a lot less of a threat than in indev
[5:05] <FoxtrotZero> Congratulations. Maybe you should get some sort of performance regulator for your fans, just so you're not overclocking your fans when you don't need the dispersion?
[5:05] <Firetempest> you respawn where you start, and you can sometimes go pick up your fallen gear
[5:05] <DoubleS> just stay close to spawn and you'll be fine
[5:05] <Jake> how come, DoubleS?
[5:05] <Jake> you can respawn after death?
[5:05] <DoubleS> you can pick up the items you drop when you die

[5:06] <Jake> more than I ever got on indev
[5:07] <ILM> so, I go to infdev
[5:07] <SubBoy> Well, msot the fans are pretty cheap (hence the noise) and so I bought a pack of 10 for $10
[5:07] <ILM> and I see multiplayer
[5:07] <Firetempest> there is a current problem in inf, you must choose quit rather then just closing your window, browsers may not like it and choke
[5:07] <vede> I think you should spawn in a random place in infdev.
[5:07] <ILM> and I was all :O
[5:07] <vede> So you can't just keep on respawning just a few blocks away from where you died.
[5:08] <DoubleS> well its stll in development
[5:08] <DoubleS> and i like making a tower at spawn and jumping down from the sky onto sheep
[5:08] <ILM> also, since it is generated randomly, it would be difficult to do
[5:08] <SubBoy> I ended up walking over a mountain to find where I wanted to build my base, and usualy when I die, I'm off exploring instead of.. in my base, if it was too random, you'd never find anything again because the maps can get so huge.
[5:08] <Firetempest> i dont want to respawn a random thousand miles form the big castle i made, i dont think so
[5:08] <vede> No it wouldn't, ILM.
[5:08] <ILM> since the generation of terrain in the circle O around player 1 would have to match up with circle P around player 2
[5:08] <ILM> if you want uniform generation without massive cliffs or drops suddenly
[5:09] * Bodie (bodieh@124-148-236-224.dyn.iinet.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[5:09] <ILM> although I for one like cliffs and drops
[5:09] <Jake> oh crap, it's getting dark...
[5:09] <vede> ILM, uh, the server will do all the level-generating, I think.
[5:09] * Jake hastilly chops down trees and builds a hut
[5:09] <ILM> yes, but
[5:09] <ILM> it generates around the player, right?
[5:10] <vede> Yeah...
[5:10] <ILM> So you have terrain generated in tube shapes around where players have walked
[5:10] <Firetempest> yes, thus the save files get bigger the more you explore
[5:10] <SubBoy> If the spawns were random, I think the best way would be to make it random within the generated terrain
[5:10] <SpaceManiac> ho hum
[5:10] <vede> So, ILM?
[5:10] <SpaceManiac> whatcha discussing?
[5:10] <ILM> I actually don't think I believe myself right now

[5:16] <FoxtrotZero> lol, tutorial level
[5:16] <SubBoy> Personally, I don't think there needs to be a tutorial level..
[5:16] * PixelEater is now known as PixelEater|ZzZ
[5:16] * PixelEater|ZzZ is now known as PixelEater
[5:16] <FoxtrotZero> I'm finding it difficult to pin down some details, i think a proper documentation is in order
[5:16] <Firetempest> you havent read some of the questions here have you
[5:17] <Jake> there sure does
[5:17] <Jake> I was -mashing- my L mouse button trying to break things when I started
[5:17] * PixelEater is now known as PixelEater|ZzZ
[5:17] <SubBoy> not a "level" though. I was thinking like a book you start with.
[5:17] <Jake> didn't occur to me to just hold it down for a good half hour
[5:17] <FoxtrotZero> Which people would read until *SSSSSSssssss* BOOM
[5:17] * melibe (mel@adsl-99-155-214-245.dsl.akrnoh.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:17] <SpaceManiac> what it needs
[5:18] <SpaceManiac> Is a pause that actually pauses
[5:18] <FoxtrotZero> Indeed.
[5:18] <ClassiestMedic> Ja
[5:18] <SubBoy> Well, I supose it couldn't hurt then, something for the most basics of basics like.. even if you have a book, if you can't open your inventory.. it's no good.
[5:18] <Jake> esc pauses, no?
[5:18] <ClassiestMedic> oui

[5:18] <vede> I hate Unity.
[5:18] <melibe> no, not unity
[5:19] <Firetempest> a controlled save environment that slowly gives you details how to play and survive will keep people from getting frustrated and quitting when they cant figure out how to make light and keep getting killed at night
[5:19] <SpaceManiac> Java
[5:19] <Firetempest> safe*
[5:19] <melibe> I mean like, something you can dig with
[5:19] <Roadcrosser> hahaha nice topic
[5:19] <melibe> and then like, put a block down
[5:19] <melibe> like, maybe a pickaxe
[5:19] <FoxtrotZero> This is why I play creative
[5:19] <melibe> minecraft needs pickaxes
[5:19] <FoxtrotZero> I'm more into building than surviving
[5:19] <Jake> how -do- you stop yourself from getting killed at night?
[5:19] <Jake> sans walling yourself in and waiting for 10 mins?
[5:19] <ClassiestMedic> torches
[5:19] <melibe> possibly shovels
[5:19] <FoxtrotZero> Enemies don't spawn in the light
[5:19] <ClassiestMedic> moats
[5:19] <ClassiestMedic> walls

[5:20] <vede> melibe, I wasn't talking about your idea.
[5:20] * Vis{SemiAFKlikeMAIL} is now known as Visiiri
[5:20] <FoxtrotZero> Yea, just build a proper wall...
[5:20] <vede> I was just stating my intense dislike for Unity.
[5:20] <Jake> torches make enemies go away?
[5:20] <FoxtrotZero> No
[5:20] <Visiiri> Jake: No, they make enemies not spawn.
[5:20] <FoxtrotZero> They make them not spawn
[5:20] <FoxtrotZero> Fuck, Ninja'd
[5:20] <melibe> I give enemies money
[5:20] <Visiiri> They aren't inside blocks, either.
[5:20] <Firetempest> torches make enemies easier to see outside.
[5:20] <melibe> and they go away
[5:21] <ILM> I just spent 10 minutes traveling westward
[5:21] <Visiiri> There's actually a huge ass glitch in infdev
[5:21] <ILM> and I found a massive lake
[5:21] <ILM> and it is nice
[5:21] <ILM> Visiiri, what kind of glitch?
[5:21] <SubBoy> Instead of a moat, I dig a 2x2 trench around my house, and then isntall a monster trap
[5:21] <Visiiri> where you can get an infinite amount of any block
[5:21] <Visiiri> All you do is delete it again and again, and it keeps coming back.
[5:21] <Visiiri> It's invisible without chunk updates nearby, though.

[5:23] <SpaceManiac> "Plug-in Unresponsive" again
[5:23] <Visiiri> Whenever I play, all I do is find the tallest nearby cliff and dig a house into the bluff.
[5:24] <Visiiri> Then I get as much coal as I can
[5:24] <Visiiri> And the night falls.
[5:24] <Visiiri> And I am set for the rest of the game.
[5:24] <Visiiri> Cliff in bluff over water = win.
[5:24] <SpaceManiac> :P
[5:24] <SpaceManiac> I have a little farming spot near the water
[5:24] <Visiiri> I had one that spawned where there was a 30x30x30 overhang
[5:24] <vede> On their web site, they make a big deal about how "multiplatform they are" and they have these groups of three logos, three screenshots, and crap, which, for most things, would have an apple, the MS logo, and a penguin. Theirs has the IE logo, the MS logo, then an apple.
[5:24] <SpaceManiac> there

[5:25] <SpaceManiac> I can open the inventory and tab away and it'll keep going
[5:25] <FoxtrotZero> I'm deeply disturbed that 54% of the internet uses IE. I'm deeply disturbed that anyone uses IE.
[5:25] <vede> And for their screenshots, they have this image where they have a bunch of different screenshots trying to show of "LOOK! WE RUN ON SOOOO MAAAANY PLATFORMS!" and they have three screenshots from Windows, and one on Mac, then an iPhone.

[5:27] <FoxtrotZero> True. Just about anything microsoft is shit.

[5:28] <Firetempest> every game with built in chat sucks.
[5:28] <FoxtrotZero> Because, lets face it, a flood of prepubescents has recently hit us, and we don't know how.
[5:28] <Dommys> Agreed

[5:29] <FoxtrotZero> Microsoft does pretty good in the game industry. I rather like the xboxes.

[5:33] <Spyre> I think string makes paintings?
[5:33] <Firetempest> string makes wool
[5:33] <FoxtrotZero> I did that for a while, but I managed to get over it for the most part. I only still do it on occasion because its been pounded into me by some of the people I hang out with.
[5:33] <Spyre> oh
[5:33] <Annihilator> if there were fishing rods
[5:33] * smn is now known as smn`off
[5:33] <Firetempest> wool is easier to farm off sheep though
[5:33] <Dommys> Wool should break down into strings.. but that would devalue the need for hunting spiders.. which is dangerous and fun
[5:34] <ClassiestMedic> Emphasis on dangerous
[5:34] <Dommys> Emphasis on Fun
[5:34] <ClassiestMedic> IMO, feathers should come from chickens

[5:34] <FoxtrotZero> I really think they need to do away with creepers and skeletons. Zombies I guess I can deal with.
[5:34] <Firetempest> birds will comes, as for when. *shrug*
[5:34] <Firetempest> come*
[5:34] <Dommys> IMO that was the original intention from what I remember
[5:34] <Spyre> I've had a hard time outrunning spiders often
[5:34] <Dommys> Foxtrot creepers are the best shit in the game
[5:34] <FoxtrotZero> As of yet
[5:35] <SpaceManiac> Hm
[5:35] <SpaceManiac> How come you can't stack bread?
[5:35] <FoxtrotZero> But its bloody unrealistic to a bothersome point
[5:35] <Dommys> Can someone skin a Spider into a dog for me? ;P
[5:35] <Spyre> wasn't there another page that had Notch's To-Do list on it with specifics?
[5:35] <Spyre> I don't remember where I found it
[5:35] <FoxtrotZero> Because it has a round top. Try actually stacking loaves of bread.
[5:35] <SpaceManiac> yeah
[5:35] <Firetempest> creepers are fun. specially when you can respawn. they don't make me rage so hard anymore

[5:36] <Jake> I just don't get farming....at all

[5:37] <Jake> how do I get seeds
[5:37] <SpaceManiac> You should have gotten one or two during tilling
[5:37] <SpaceManiac> They pop up sometimes
[5:37] <Jake> I got some but never quite grasped how
[5:37] <SpaceManiac> ah
[5:37] <Firetempest> any food should stack, not to 64, but atleast 5
[5:37] <Jake> then planted them
[5:37] <SpaceManiac> When you till, there's a random chance of getting seeds
[5:37] <SpaceManiac> Plant them
[5:37] <SpaceManiac> And wait for them to grow
[5:37] <Jake> right...
[5:37] <SpaceManiac> Then harvest them
[5:38] <Spyre> you need to plant them near water
[5:38] <SpaceManiac> You'll get at least one wheat and at least one seed
[5:38] <Jake> should I just till land like crazy but plant the seeds in my damp soil?
[5:38] <SpaceManiac> and maybe more seed
[5:38] <Spyre> where the ground is darkest
[5:38] <Spyre> yes
[5:38] <Jake> okay...
[5:38] <Jake> but I've left seeds growing for ages
[5:38] <Spyre> I tilled half the continent, then came back home and planted near my ponds
[5:38] <FoxtrotZero> spyre
[5:38] <FoxtrotZero> You don't need to plant near water, its just a better idea
[5:38] <Firetempest> plants will grow on dry land, but it takes much longer
[5:38] <Spyre> ah! in my experiments about 60% just flat out died
[5:39] <Spyre> but maybe I was doing something wrong
[5:39] <FoxtrotZero> More than something *BURN*
[5:39] <Firetempest> cant walk all over it
[5:39] <SpaceManiac> I have 22 seed right now
[5:39] <FoxtrotZero> Truefax
[5:39] <SpaceManiac> And much less usable land

[5:42] <FoxtrotZero> Anyway, just fence off your farming area, like, between two hills or something, i guess, and use a blocka sand for a doorway
[5:42] <SpaceManiac> Like
[5:42] <SpaceManiac> There was land
[5:42] <SpaceManiac> Then some rock grew over most of it
[5:42] <SpaceManiac> leaving a little cubby
[5:42] <Spyre> is it true that mobs can spawn in the air along walls if they aren't lit well enough?
[5:42] <FoxtrotZero> It doesn't matter, fence off the - did you just say the rock GREW?
[5:43] <FoxtrotZero> Spyre, i'd suggest you not find out
[5:43] <SpaceManiac> well
[5:43] <SpaceManiac> during map generation, I presume

[5:43] <FoxtrotZero> Anyway, just fence off wherever you can enter from
[5:43] <SpaceManiac> stay outta mah base
[5:44] <SubBoy> Also, if the map didn't give you flat land.. make it flat
[5:44] <FoxtrotZero> Indeed

[5:44] <SpaceManiac> there
[5:44] <SpaceManiac> sheep is now trapped
[5:44] <FoxtrotZero> ...
[5:44] <FoxtrotZero> Or you could kill the bloody thing
[5:44] <SubBoy> Don't be fooled, they despawn, and respawn elsewhere
[5:44] <SpaceManiac> I want my wool D:
[5:44] <FoxtrotZero> lol, despawn
[5:44] <SpaceManiac> My house needs its paintings
[5:45] <FoxtrotZero> But... For wool... Don't you... Just kill it?
[5:45] <Jake> just shear it!
[5:45] <SpaceManiac> nah
[5:45] <FoxtrotZero> Oh.
[5:45] <SpaceManiac> punch 'em once and you get wool
[5:45] <SpaceManiac> then it can grow back
[5:45] <FoxtrotZero> In that case, get a sheep farm.
[5:45] <SubBoy> Actualy, you punch it once , and it drops 1-3 wool, then it regrows
[5:45] <SpaceManiac> yep
[5:45] <vede> Does it regrow in infdev now?
[5:45] <SpaceManiac> Alright

[6:18] <Cial> is it?
[6:18] <Firetempest> creeper blackpowder should be green. that would be funny

[6:21] <Jake> roughly...
[6:21] <Cial> eh noobs
[6:21] <Firetempest> or it can be kept the same and creepers can drop more.
[6:21] <Cial> williamdh, that would make getting TNT to easy
[6:22] <Jake> ffffffffff
[6:22] <williamdh> i thought itd be interesting to have different types of tnt but stuff like that wouldnt happen till at least beta if ever
[6:22] <Jake> TNT doesn't drop down in infdev mode >_<
[6:22] <SubBoy> I think if you want TNT to be cheaper, have the raft template spit out two.
[6:22] <Jake> blew up my home again
[6:22] <melibe> I want cannon balls
[6:22] <williamdh> its a balance because while tnt is very powerful and thus you dont want it to be TOO easy to get it is also one of the most fun things to play with so you dont want it too hard

[6:25] <Firetempest> to make bombs cheeper, you can always provide a new way to produce blackpowder too. like sea salt and coal. closest i can think of for sulfur and charcoal
[6:25] <williamdh> another idea id had on tnt was needing the fuse to be lit with fire, that would cause flint and steel to have greater usefulness and it would allow you to remove misplaced tnt or try to foil an enemys trap

[6:52] <Dommys> I haven't responded rudely. Rudely would be "your ideas are fucking stupid, please keep them to yourselves". Instead, I merely stated I was more optimistic for Notches current idea of Minecraft :D

[6:54] <FoxtrotZero> That reminds me, when do we get proper water in creative?
[6:54] <Dommys> FoxtrotZero, Who's arguing?
[6:54] <williamdh> i think its safe to say that notch is focusing on bring it to beta
[6:55] <williamdh> yea i think we raped up things fairly civilly right there
[6:55] <FoxtrotZero> Touches
[6:55] <Dommys> PRETTY SAFE TO SAY, when he posted "The road to Beta" 8 days ago. lol
[6:55] <FoxtrotZero> Well, keep in mind, getting to beta implys acheivement proper.
[6:56] <williamdh> i think multi-survival is a pretty big achievement to qualify as beta since along with creative thats the core game
[6:57] <williamdh> hell probably takle water after that due to the high demand

[7:13] <Wervyn> Sometimes it's the clearest and most logical way to do what you need to do. It is possible to use it in a way that makes your code more readible and less confusing.
[7:14] * williamdh (Mibbit@193-15.suscom-maine.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:14] <AotC> yeah, but chances are you won't run into that
[7:14] <Zaneo> I go for efficient processing wise, compared to logical
[7:14] <Zaneo> logical to humans*
[7:14] <Wervyn> Such as error control or nested loops. It's uncommon, sure, but very occasionally it's the right tool for the job.
[7:14] <Budda> logic? pfft thats overrated, my diety will show me how to code!
[7:15] <AotC> if you JUST learned about try/catch then you're probably new to programming.. in which case you know nothing of efficiency :|
[7:15] <Budda> wait, what? Wervyn, nested loops? Why not 'break' or something, you know, normal
[7:15] <Zaneo> Well i know a bit obviously not as much as you
[7:15] <Zaneo> i know the theories behind it
[7:16] <AotC> if you just started then you shouldn't even TRY to be efficient
[7:16] <Wervyn> Okay, say you've got two while loops.
[7:16] <Budda> this will be good, carry on
[7:16] <Wervyn> And something in the inner while loop is supposed to trigger a break out of both.
[7:16] <Zaneo> make it check a boolean variable that is an exit flag?
[7:16] <Wervyn> Now, you could break, but then you'll be in the outer loop, so you'll have to test a condition to see if the inner loop terminated and break on that.
[7:16] <Budda> while (!derp) { while (!derp) { derp = true; } }
[7:17] <Budda> :)
[7:17] <Wervyn> OR, you could just break out.
[7:17] <Zaneo> Goto?
[7:17] <Zaneo> xD
[7:17] <Wervyn> You want to include a !derp with each of the conditions in your while commands? That's your idea of easier to read?
[7:17] <Budda> maybe not easier, but funnier
[7:17] <Budda> derp

[7:28] <FoxtrotZero> The B-25G's successor, the B-25H, had even more firepower. The M4 gun was replaced by the lighter T13E1, designed specifically for the aircraft. The 75 mm (2.95 in) gun fired at a muzzle velocity of 2,362 ft/s (about 720 m/s). Due to its low rate of fire (approximately four rounds could be fired in a single strafing run) and relative ineffectiveness against ground targets, as well as...
[7:28] <FoxtrotZero> ...substantial recoil, the 75 mm (2.95 in) gun was sometimes removed from both G and H models and replaced with two additional .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns as a field modification. The -H also mounted four fixed forward-firing .50 (12.7 mm) machine guns in the nose, four more fixed ones in forward-firing cheek blisters, two more in the top turret, one each in a pair of new waist positions, and
[7:28] <FoxtrotZero> a final pair in a new tail gunner's position. Company promotional material bragged the B-25H could "bring to bear 10 machine guns coming and four going, in addition to the 75 mm cannon, a brace of eight rockets and 3,000 lb (1,360 kg) of bombs."

[7:32] <FoxtrotZero> Interesting fact, In one of the old Call of Duties (Big Red One, i think), the B12 sported a forward bugeye turret, bombadeer's position, tail gun, and underslung ball turret. No model had a ball turret beneath, and i'm pretty sure the only models to sport tail gunners had at least two sets of blister turrets
[7:32] <FoxtrotZero> Well
[7:32] <FoxtrotZero> Interesting if you're me.
[7:32] <williamdh> not saying its not interesting, just off topic

[7:37] <AotC> http://www.minecraft.net/haspaid.jsp?user=aotc looks like i am not eating over the weekend >_>
[7:37] <FoxtrotZero> The B-25 was a safe and forgiving aircraft to fly. With an engine out, 60?? banking turns into the dead engine were possible, and control could be easily maintained down to 145 mph (230 km/h). However, the pilot had to remember to maintain engine-out directional control at low speeds after take off with rudder - if this was attempted with ailerons, the aircraft would snap out of control. The...
[7:37] <FoxtrotZero> ...tricycle landing gear made for excellent visibility while taxiing. The only significant complaint about the B-25 was the extremely high noise level produced by its engines; as a result, many pilots eventually suffered from various degrees of hearing loss.[5] The high noise level was due to design and space restrictions in the engine cowlings which resulted in the exhaust "stacks"...
[7:37] <williamdh> theyd quickly become nearly as hated as creepers id wager
[7:37] <FoxtrotZero> ...protuding directly from the cowling ring and partly covered by a small triangular fairing. This directed exhaust and noise directly at the pilot and crew compartments. Crew members and operators on the airshow circuit frequently comment that "the B-25 is the fastest way to turn aviation fuel directly into noise".
[7:38] <Bodie> i've always suggested sharks as rare monsters would be awesome
[7:38] <Bodie> and possibly whales that drop porkchops
[7:38] <FoxtrotZero> ...
[7:38] <FoxtrotZero> Whale pork?
[7:38] <Bodie> yum yum
[7:38] <Bodie> wharu porku
[7:38] <SubBoy> Hah "true"
[7:38] <FoxtrotZero> Okay, this'll be my last post about the mitchell, just because this one is entertaining
[7:38] <FoxtrotZero> The Mitchell was also an amazingly sturdy aircraft and could withstand tremendous punishment. One well-known B-25C of the 321st Bomb Group was nicknamed "Patches" because its crew chief painted all the aircraft's flak hole patches with high-visibility zinc chromate paint. By the end of the war, this aircraft had completed over 300 missions, was belly-landed six times and sported over 400...
[7:38] <FoxtrotZero> ...patched holes. The airframe was so bent, straight-and-level flight required 8?? of left aileron trim and 6?? of right rudder, causing the aircraft to "crab" sideways across the sky.
[7:38] <williamdh> imagine falling in the water only to have a shark suddenly appear next to you like th ejump attack of a spider and send you flying taking out a huge chunk of heath
[7:39] <williamdh> itd certainly change tactics of useing water to escape

[7:48] <TKGP_DS> then you are awesome
[7:48] <FoxtrotZero> Thats true, actually, it would be helpful
[7:49] <Yourself> especially if weather effects ever get in and you don't always have clouds
[7:49] <williamdh> i wouldnt be surprised if some sort of map was eventualy put in
[7:49] <Jake> make it something you have to forve
[7:49] <Yourself> or it's overcast, so cloud movement is undetectable
[7:49] <Jake> *forge
[7:49] <Jake> perhaps with iron, water and....flint?
[7:49] <FoxtrotZero> That, and among other things, i wouldn't mind a toggle on/toggle off map overlay or something of the like, at least for creative
[7:49] <FoxtrotZero> Water?
[7:49] <FoxtrotZero> Why would you need water?
[7:49] <Yourself> the two items i want are a compass and some kind of placeable clock
[7:49] <williamdh> didnt notch mention the idea of a map showing thge landscape when you generate a level at some point ?
[7:49] <Jake> I'm pretty sure the public to-do list included a water-bucket system
[7:50] <TKGP_DS> sort of, will
[7:50] <williamdh> one of the things im most exited for is varied landscape
[7:50] <FoxtrotZero> But what does water have to do with crafting a compass?
[7:50] <Yourself> i liked the idea of having a map that fills in, but needs craftable items like paper
[7:50] <Yourself> i kind of like the idea of people making it their job to explore
[7:50] <FoxtrotZero> You'd need Iron, Glass, and i guess... Flint, maybe? Need something magnetic. Obsidian, i guess
[7:51] <Yourself> <FoxtrotZero> But what does water have to do with crafting a compass?

[7:52] <FoxtrotZero> Theres no reason you shouldn't be able to make a conventional compass, plus it gives a crafting usage to glass

[7:52] <Yourself> maybe iron deposits could have a chance of dropping lodestone
[7:52] <FoxtrotZero> I suppose
[7:52] <williamdh> id like to see the option for reinforced blocks
[7:52] <FoxtrotZero> I kind of like using obsidian, because its supposed to have strange properties. He mentioned something about using it for floating islands.
[7:52] <Adura> Fuckin' lodestones how do they work?!
[7:53] <TKGP_DS> oh god, ICP
[7:53] <williamdh> combining multiple blocks for a single stronger one
[7:53] <williamdh> i love the flying obsidian idea
[7:53] <Dudebro> Creepers are miracles
[7:53] <SeanV> I wonder if we will have gears like in that one video
[7:53] <Yourself> them alchemists be gettin' me pissed
[7:53] <TKGP_DS> we need pelicans next
[7:54] <TKGP_DS> they could drop cell phones
[7:54] <SubBoy> Lodestone drops would be fun.
[7:54] <SubBoy> Though really you only need them underground..

[7:55] <Adura> We need natives next, we can enslave them.

[7:55] <williamdh> would you settle for animal slaves?
[7:55] <Adura> That's just creepy.
[7:55] <Jake> how do you drain an area of water?
[7:55] <Yourself> interesting, it's possible that lodestones get magnetized by lightning
[7:56] <williamdh> well domestication is in notch's plans
[7:56] <Jake> no worries, I just sectioned it off and it's draining
[7:56] <SubBoy> So.. id you put an iron ingot on an alter with some gold and offer it to the Notch god, it gets struck by lightning, and you get a ldoestone?
[7:57] <Yourself> if you like, i prefer it being a random drop

[7:58] <Dudebro> Why do we need compasses?
[7:58] <TKGP_DS> direction :|
[7:58] <SeanV> screw compasses I prefer just a map
[7:59] <SubBoy> Well, you only might need it underground, but it's easy to use the sun.

[7:59] <Dudebro> yeh

[7:59] <Norend> Screw maps
[7:59] <Yourself> <Dudebro> look at the clouds
[7:59] <SubBoy> And real maps don't tell you direction..
[7:59] <Yourself> underground
[7:59] * williamdh (Mibbit@193-15.suscom-maine.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[8:00] <Dudebro> Why would you need north underground?
[8:00] <Norend> You can still get a basic direction of where you are going underground
[8:00] <Norend> If you remember
[8:00] <Norend> Or mark it
[8:00] <TKGP_DS> large cavern systems?
[8:00] <Norend> Mark the cave systems
[8:00] <TKGP_DS> sure, fine
[8:00] <Yourself> you try remembering which way you're facing while fighting monsters
[8:01] <Dudebro> ok
[8:01] <Dudebro> I will
[8:01] <SubBoy> Though really, specific directions are only important underground if your'e linking up areas with a tunnel, or avoiding a lake
[8:01] <TKGP_DS> compass isn't needed, for certain, but I think it's cool anyways -_-
[8:01] <Yourself> but your opposition to the suggestion is stupid, because it'd be useful
[8:01] <SeanV> I'd just prefer unifying a compass with an overmap
[8:01] <Dudebro> it's excessive
[8:01] <SubBoy> See, now unifying it with an overmap I'd disagree with, but making a compass item available would be fine.

[8:02] <SeanV> you're excessive
[8:02] <SubBoy> Actualy, it's the overmap that I don't like.
[8:02] <Dudebro> Your face is excessive.
[8:02] <SeanV> your mom's labia are excessive
[8:02] <TKGP_DS> I think map is weird
[8:02] <TKGP_DS> compass is cool tho
[8:02] <SubBoy> But I WOULD like paper you can write/draw on.
[8:02] <Jake> because some people are very poor at orienteering, like me
[8:02] <Dudebro> Or signs
[8:02] <Dudebro> that'd be cool
[8:02] <Jake> sorry, delayed pressing of enter there
[8:03] <SeanV> see I don't wanna have to draw shit every time I move 100 feet
[8:03] <SeanV> or draw fucking arrows and triangulate shit with my compass
[8:03] <SeanV> I wanna play the game and explore and not get lost
[8:03] <SubBoy> Then.. use a breadcrumb system, it's easy.
[8:03] <SubBoy> And actualy lights your path at night
[8:03] <Norend> Yeah
[8:03] <Norend> Exactly
[8:04] <Yourself> i've gotten lost in caves even with a breadcrumb system
[8:04] <SeanV> I usually light up every leg of a cave system before I move on
[8:04] <Yourself> prior to infdev, naturally
[8:04] <Dudebro> I block off mineral-less cave systems
[8:04] <Yourself> but that's also a somewhat expensive method of navigation
[8:04] <Dudebro> to save torches
[8:04] <Yourself> because of the material requirements
[8:04] <SeanV> and I don't wanna have to plant a bunch of blocks that might just be blocking a hole or a lava flow or something
[8:04] <Yourself> i'm always starving for coal
[8:04] <SubBoy> Caves might need a slightly smarter one, for exmample: Put a torch on a wall facing the start of the cave
[8:05] <SeanV> after three days I never worry about coal, except on floating maps
[8:05] <SubBoy> Use wood for furnaces instead.
[8:05] <Dudebro> For light, not furnaces
[8:05] <Dudebro> I play on hell maps, mostly
[8:05] <Dudebro> so I light my base with lava
[8:05] <SubBoy> That's what I mean, if you don't burn coal in furnaces.. your'e pretty much set on torches
[8:05] <Norend> I use wood in my furnaces because there is tons of it
[8:06] <SubBoy> But torches won't be the permenant solution, so I'm not sure how that will work once their replacement comes out and torces burn out
[8:06] <SeanV> real men use mushrooms for furnace fuel
[8:06] <Yourself> anyway, why are these even considered arguments for not adding a craftable compass?
[8:06] <SeanV> craftable compass is find
[8:06] <SeanV> *fine
[8:06] <SeanV> just give me a goddamn map lol
[8:06] <SubBoy> Hnn? I am just saying I wouldn't use a compass for that.
[8:06] <SeanV> maybe all these things could be options, set in the server
[8:06] <SubBoy> It's the overmap I don't like.
[8:07] <SeanV> hardcore mode-no compasses or maps, 3X spawn monsters .5X spawn pigs
[8:07] <SeanV> I hope Notch is planning that
[8:08] <Norend> Maps would seem hard to do
[8:08] <Norend> Even to draw
[8:08] <SubBoy> Unless you're good at making maps.. Making that skill useful to other people
[8:08] <SubBoy> Just like building cool looking fortresses that are functional too, is hard to do
[8:08] <Jake> you can burn wood?
[8:08] <Jake> bloody hell...
[8:08] <Yourself> ever seen early maps of the earth and how crappy they were?
[8:08] <SubBoy> You can indeed burn wood in your furnace.
[8:09] <Jake> does it last as long as coal?
[8:09] <Yourself> no
[8:09] <Yourself> not even close
[8:09] <Jake> figures
[8:09] <SubBoy> somehow, I'm pretty sure they're still better looking than ACTUAL MINECRAFT...
[8:09] <Norend> Can't you still just find an alternate, and use paper+pencil?
[8:09] <Norend> Or paint
[8:10] <SubBoy> I would like shareable maps ingame though.
[8:10] <SubBoy> Besides, ahve you seen topographic maps made RECENTLY? They're pretty cool.
[8:11] <SeanV> made with computers and shit by engineers
[8:13] <SubBoy> Uh, not always much?
