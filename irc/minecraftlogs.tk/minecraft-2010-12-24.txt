[0:38] <JabJabJab> I know changing system time causes speedhack to occur for a few seconds

[0:38] <JabJabJab> but other than that why would u need this?

[0:38] <Brossly> I bought the game, from 12 hours exactly... and when I open it now, it tells me that I'm not a premium.

[0:39] <JabJabJab> Hmmm

[0:39] <Miclee> Brossly, wait 24 hours total. If your account is not upgraded after that time, e-mail payment@mojang.com.

[0:39] <Miclee> I should set that to a script.

[0:41] <Miclee> test, please wait 24 hours after your payment, as it can take that long for your account to be upgraded. If, after that time, you account is still not upgraded, please send an e-mail to payment@mojang.com.

[0:41] <Miclee> Sweet.

[0:41] <JabJabJab> hmmm I dont know..

[0:41] <JabJabJab> I guess

[0:41] <JabJabJab> notch did some edit

[0:42] <JabJabJab> where u can set time

[0:42] <JabJabJab> hmmm i dunno man.. I havent seen that setting yet

[0:42] <Dasaru> Why don't creepers spawn in the middle of the day? That never has made any sense to me... :/

[0:42] <buddy1987> well when I boot the server, I get a wierd message...

[0:42] <JabJabJab> hmmm

[0:42] * Moocman has joined #minecraft.

[0:42] <Miclee> JabJabJab, can you please talk in complete statements instead of flooding your statement over multiple lines?

[0:44] <Azathoth> waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaater

[0:44] <DrZaius> What, like Pokemon Gold?

[0:44] <Dasaru> JabJabJab: That would be awesome

[0:44] <buddy1987> JabJabJab ... this is it [Warning] Can't Keep Up! Did the system time change,or is the server overloaded?

[0:44] <klepto> buddy1987, it's normal to get that once on startup

[0:45] * Ryan9104 has left #minecraft: No reason specified

[0:45] <klepto> only start worrying if you get it more than that

[0:45] <JabJabJab> Oh heh

[0:45] <Dasaru> Who else wants mobs to spawn in the middle of the day??

[0:45] <JabJabJab> well buddy here is this thing:

[0:45] <buddy1987> ah ok...

[0:45] <Azathoth> [Warning] Old men. Warning.

[0:45] <JabJabJab> This is a java server (java as in memory hog) so not only is it a java server, it is alpha (beta) and it sucks with memory issues.

[0:45] * petercoulton_ has joined #minecraft.

[0:46] <JabJabJab> That msg is there because it means java fails, but that's okay because it's better than nothing honestly

[0:46] <Apothekenbier> -.- Bought the game yesterday afternoon... still not premium... can someone help me?

[0:46] <Azathoth> iu love how "alpha" is just eh genrela excuse for eerrythg

[0:46] <JabJabJab> it's better now that what it used to be

[0:46] <JabJabJab> I hosted a server since 5 min after notch gave it out

[0:47] <Tsathoggua_Box> serious business

[0:47] <buddy1987> ah ok... so if my server loads correctly, it will appear in the list though?

[0:47] <JabJabJab> anyway system time change means nothing.. it's a stupid check notch made

[0:47] <JabJabJab> yup

[0:47] <buddy1987> k

[0:47] <JabJabJab> i think it's because the program freezes with it's sync to the system time

[0:47] <buddy1987> ah ok...

[0:47] <JabJabJab> because in notch's code, system time is a huge thing for his checks..

[0:48] <JabJabJab> For instance, if u get on minecraft, and get in-game.. then u go to ur clock on ur pc and change it, go back to mc, and u will speed like hell for 10 - 15 seconds

[0:57] <JabJabJab> It's sexy

[0:57] <JWilbur> its pointless

[0:58] <JabJabJab> Minecraft is pointless

[0:58] <dazappa> oh, can someone explain this to me? http://imgur.com/MovV8.png

[0:58] <JWilbur> minecafrt is srs bsns!

[0:58] <JabJabJab> Dazappa yes i can

[0:58] <dazappa> for some reason my pressure pad on the right door has power when the pad isn't pressed? :S

[0:58] <JabJabJab> The doors are like binary, but other one is switched.. just make a repeator gate underneath and it will work

[0:59] * buddy1987 has quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client

[0:59] <JWilbur> inverter

[0:59] <JabJabJab> Do you know how to do that?

[0:59] <JWilbur> not gate

[0:59] <JWilbur> torch broseph

[0:59] <Pacer> jabjab, it's cool, but i think minecraft time is set up similar to the way gta time is set up

[0:59] <JabJabJab> yeah i f&#39ed up on termenology :P

[0:59] <Pacer> people get bored with a time in-game

[0:59] <Pacer> quickly

[0:59] <Pacer> but some might like it

[0:59] <dazappa> aha good, I was just wondering why a repeater

[0:59] <Pacer> i might try it and switch back and forth

[0:59] <Pacer> now and again

[0:59] * SteveDave has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[1:00] <dazappa> yes I can make a not gate just fine, but will I be able to keep the pad there still (right in front of the door)?

[1:00] * Juggernaut151 is now known as Juggernaut.

[1:00] <JabJabJab> Yes.. this is how cool pads are

[1:00] <JabJabJab> see pad is attached to block

[1:00] <JabJabJab> but once pressed, if below the block supporting the pad lies a redstonedust trail, it will light up

[1:01] <JabJabJab> point the not thing towards the door the door is attached to. it will work

[1:01] <JabJabJab> i mean block

[1:01] <JabJabJab> lol

[1:28] <dazappa> you have the pads 1 square from the door, mine are right next to them

[1:29] <JabJabJab> well it can work that way too

[1:34] <Zenreich> visiiri: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdf5n-zI14

[1:34] <Khalimba> First off, i have no idea how to host shit.

[1:34] <Visiiri> Oh, okay.

[1:34] <Visiiri> You're using Windows 7?

[1:35] <JabJabJab> Okay this seems like a interesting issue

[1:35] * shadoom has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[1:35] <JabJabJab> Im going to keep working on this

[1:35] <Khalimba> Nope, Vista

[1:35] <JabJabJab> and find a way to fix this dazappa

[1:35] <Khalimba> I know how bad it is

[1:35] <dazappa> all righty

[1:35] <Visiiri> Shouldn't make too much of a difference.

[1:35] <JabJabJab> just keep watching i guess lol

[1:35] <Visiiri> solarus, there's two parts to hosting a server

[1:35] <dazappa> I guess the best "fix" is to separate pad and door by a square unless you can solve this mystery

[1:35] <Visiiri> The exe handles the first one- it just has to be running.

[1:35] <Zenreich> Khalimba, I've got a server up right now with hMod and a bunch of plugins, biggest castle you've ever seen, and almost lag-free on a dedicated box, just needs traffic

[1:36] <Khalimba> Allright, I'm no griefing faggot, so yeah.

[1:36] <dazappa> the problem I have with the server is that it's made in java

[1:36] <Visiiri> But there is also Port Forwarding, where you punch a little hole in your modem to allow the server's packets to go through.

[1:36] <dazappa> so it doesn't play nice with ovz

[1:36] <Zenreich> Could save you the trouble of setting one up yourself

[2:06] * Oddtwang has joined #minecraft.

[2:06] <Tsathoggua_Box> Like, basic obvious security, of course

[4:11] <klepto> there was a novel?

[4:12] <klepto> besides all the in-game stuff I mean

[4:12] <Caironater|Mobile> idk

[4:12] <Caironater|Mobile> thats what i'm asking

[4:12] * nuke3d has left #minecraft: No reason specified

[4:12] <icky> i'm excited for the new game engine as well

[4:12] <klepto> apparently so http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345508017

[4:13] * Sirrush has joined #minecraft.

[4:13] <Caironater|Mobile> gameebryo?

[4:13] <icky> and it was used in new vegas as well

[4:13] <Caironater|Mobile> ok

[4:15] <icky> doubtful

[4:15] <Atr> I hope not

[4:15] * FoxWolf has joined #minecraft.

[4:15] <Caironater|Mobile> ok

[4:15] <icky> its a single player focused franchise anyway

[4:15] <Caironater|Mobile> why not?

[4:15] <icky> adding mp would really ruin it

[4:15] <Caironater|Mobile> ok

[4:15] <Caironater|Mobile> i've hardly played

[4:15] * zapu has quit: Quit: Leaving

[4:15] <Caironater|Mobile> only about half an hour of oblivion

[4:15] <klepto> yeah plus none of the elder scrolls game plots would make sense in multiplayer

[4:16] <Caironater|Mobile> ok

[4:16] <klepto> because you're always the future savior of the land or whatever

[4:16] <Atr> Caironater|Mobile : yeah, there was a novel - it was quite good, had all approved canon in it as well from the bethesda lore database

[4:16] * Solsky has joined #minecraft.

[4:16] <Caironater|Mobile> might read it then

[4:16] <icky> although mp would work if it was limited to two players

[4:16] <Atr> Possibly

[4:16] <icky> that would be really fun/interesting without breaking the game too much

[4:16] <Caironater|Mobile> like portal 2

[4:16] * Rinsmaster has joined #minecraft.

[4:16] <Atr> or do a baldurs gate sort of thing

[5:22] <SirWaddles> Is that that nexon game?

[5:22] <Viral> yes

[5:22] <VioletPenguin> nexon sucks

[5:22] <Rijnders> yes

[5:22] <Viral> it's what hat-fortress 2 is turning into

[5:22] <SirWaddles> I played MapleStory for ages =3

[5:22] <VioletPenguin> nexon sucks so bad that no matter how good the game, I won't play it if it's hosted by nexon

[5:22] <SirWaddles> ah, yes, Hat Simulator 2010.

[5:22] * ferret__ has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[5:22] <SirWaddles> was just playing that before.

[5:22] <icky> nexon games

[5:22] <Viral> only nexon game i ever played was CA

[5:22] <Viral> MAN so awful

[5:22] <icky> i remember watching my cousin play a game a long time ago

[5:23] * Esge has joined #minecraft.

[5:23] <icky> it was like... 2d mmoish

[5:23] <icky> i forget what it was called

[5:23] <Viral> i hate games that reward people through microtransactions

[5:23] <VioletPenguin> maplestory

[5:23] <Viral> it's such rubbish

[5:23] <icky> no not maplestory

[5:23] <icky> this was years before that

[5:23] <Rijnders> TF2: Metrosexual Edition (Get all the accessories a manwoman will never want).

[5:23] <Viral> skill should define how a person does in a game

[5:23] <SirWaddles> I had a Treasure Hat for a while, then I switched to the World Traveler hat, later was wearing a Fez, then a Dapper Topper and a bit after that I chose to wear a Fancy Fedora.

[5:23] <icky> the people were smalllllllll

[5:23] <VioletPenguin> microtransactions aren't that bad

[5:23] <Viral> Esge, sup

[5:23] <icky> and it was like, samurai-y or chinese-y

[5:23] <icky> i think it was called nexus or something

[5:23] <VioletPenguin> oh, dunno then

[5:23] <SirWaddles> Maboingi or whatever?

[5:23] <icky> NEXUS TK

[5:23] <icky> THAT'S IT

[5:23] <Visiiri> Viral, someone with skill could get all of the same stats as someone without skill in that game, so your arguement is void

[5:24] * ICARU5_ has joined #minecraft.

[5:24] <Viral> fedora is the only hat i genuinely like in tf2

[5:24] * garry has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[5:24] <Viral> and it fits with the art style

[5:24] <Rijnders> you don't even need auto aim in TF2

[5:24] <Rijnders> it's ridiculous

[5:24] <Viral> Visiiri, stats - not items, right?

[5:24] <Viral> Rijnders, you do if you're not playing on a public server.

[5:24] * BlendErX has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[5:24] <icky> Rijnders, why is that ridiculous, are you saying it's easy to aim already?

[5:24] <Rijnders> yes.

[5:24] <Viral> and certain items having advantages - and stats not defining skill

[5:24] <Visiiri> Viral, if the stats are the same, then you're paying for things that are purely aesthetical.

[5:24] <Rijnders> you point the gun into someones general direction

[5:24] <icky> well its a pc game....

[5:25] * BlendErX has joined #minecraft.

[5:25] <icky> why would you need auto aim at all

[5:25] <Viral> ok

[5:25] <Rijnders> auto aim on PC games only makes it harder ):

[5:25] <icky> unless you're one of the few tards that considers the console tf2 to be a 'game'

[5:25] <SirWaddles> I agree.

[5:25] <Rijnders> like my penis etc.

[5:25] <Rijnders> just incase anyone was going to make that joke

[5:25] <SirWaddles> I always turned it off on Borderlands.

[5:25] <SirWaddles> yea, sure, "joke", as if that was the right word for it.

[5:25] * Jaska has joined #minecraft.

[5:26] <Rijnders> well icky, the console version of TF2 doesn't have the absurd amount of stupid accessories that distract from the main game

[5:26] <Viral> but it's still full of bugs from ང

[5:26] * VioletPenguin facepaws

[5:26] <Viral> གྷ even?

[5:26] <Rijnders> from release i think

[5:26] <Viral> mmmm

[5:26] <Viral> so it's unplayable there too

[5:26] <Viral> :P

[5:26] <Rijnders> it runs a lot smoother though

[5:26] <Rijnders> i noticed how all the special items don't have LoD renders

[5:27] <SirWaddles> often it's because they're community content, and us community contributers can't be arsed making LoD models

[5:27] <Viral> yep

[5:27] <SirWaddles> often not even animations or kill icons or submitted.

[5:27] <Rijnders> valve should

[5:45] <Rijnders> isn't darksiders on sale on steam/

[6:01] <MT`AwAy> klepto: maybe the confirmation page should give a bigger delay, because it says 1 hour we get worried

[6:01] <Penoze> That's asking politely how old that person is

[6:13] <Maaka> as nice as it is

[6:13] <Farcrusader> because the servers aren't run by him

[6:13] <wing> Penoze: if he hosts the servers, ok

[6:13] <fr4s> dies Ananas ist purpurrot

[6:13] <Farcrusader> it's run by individuals unaffiliated with mojang specifications

[6:13] * elsporko has joined #minecraft.

[6:14] <Salzkorn> fr4s, diese Ananas

[6:14] <Penoze> I think he may do it though

[6:14] <Farcrusader> i hate monthly fee setups

[6:14] <fr4s> but how do I say pineapple in not plural?

[6:14] <Penoze> When he actually has a team to work with

[6:14] <Farcrusader> he already has a team

[6:14] <fr4s> I want a singular pineapple

[6:14] <VioletPenguin> Ananas is single

[6:14] <fr4s> not many.

[6:14] <Penoze> I don't really call that a team

[6:14] <Maaka> ananas is non-plural

[6:14] <fr4s> oh

[6:14] <Maaka> aka singular

[6:14] <Maaka> xD

[6:14] <wing> monthly payments kinda sucks for people who don't have that much money

[6:14] <Farcrusader> oh so what do you call a team?

[6:14] <fr4s> so I still have to do diese

[6:14] <Farcrusader> 500 people:?

[6:14] <fr4s> beause it ends with s?

[6:14] <Salzkorn> yep

[6:14] <Maaka> ananase is plural

[6:14] <Salzkorn> it's die Ananas, feminine

[6:15] * SanctuaryRemix has joined #minecraft.

[6:15] <Penoze> If he charges 5 bucks, and 100k people have a subscription. :O Possibilities

[6:15] <wing> Ananase sounds stupid

[6:15] <Maaka> ananase is possible

[6:15] <VioletPenguin> really Ananase?

[6:15] * stefke_mirakel has quit: Quit: leaving

[6:15] <wing> don't think so

[6:16] <wing> never heard it before

[6:16] <Maaka> or ananasse

[6:16] <Salzkorn> nobody really knows

[6:16] <Penoze> Why not just say pineapple?

[6:16] <Maaka> can't remember

[6:16] <Maaka> lol

[6:17] <fr4s> can someone explain to me why this sentence is incorrect:

[6:17] <fr4s> Wo steht die stuele? Sie steht dort.

[6:18] <Salzkorn> fr4s:

[6:18] <Maaka> asda: ..

[6:18] <Salzkorn> 1. St�hle/Stuehle, is plural

[6:18] <Salzkorn> so it has to be stehen, in both sentences

[6:18] <Penoze> German is a very hard language to learn

[6:18] <Salzkorn> uh, yeah

[6:18] <fr4s> hm, I guess I'll have to figure this out with time

[6:18] <fr4s> I thought german was similar to english and thats why I'm learning it fast

[6:19] <Penoze> You have a lot of rules to abide by

[6:19] <fr4s> its just mainly the structure and grammar thats bothering me some, I'm only 6 days in you know

[6:19] <cheezychicken> it has similarities to english

[6:19] <Abraham> Hello good morning to all.

[6:20] <Maaka> its not like many germans would master it eihter

[6:20] <Salzkorn> fr4s, german is a really hard language, you have to learn the genders of every substantive

[6:20] <Maaka> well genders come with time

[6:20] <fr4s> genders arent that hard

[6:20] <fr4s> I learn the gender with each word

[6:20] <Penoze> Man genders are just ffs

[6:20] <sexyGirl> sad

[6:20] <Penoze> You have to know them by default

[6:21] <Penoze> Otherwise guess it, no way of actually knowing it without a dictionary

[6:21] <fr4s> a real german man says der everything

[6:21] <fr4s> der frau

[6:21] <Abraham> Umm sorry to interupt but I need to speak to an admin regarding an account that says not premium.

[6:21] <fr4s> im going to turn german around town

[6:21] <Maaka> what salzkorn said

[6:21] <fr4s> and make it happy

[6:21] <Penoze> I think the English language is very easy to learn lol

[6:21] <Penoze> The rules are simple

[6:21] <fr4s> american english is even easier

[6:22] <fr4s> someone figure thsi out

[6:25] <Maaka> i think japanese itself is actually easy to learn; once you get your brain around new grammar structures

[6:25] <Maaka> kanji are a pain though

[6:25] <Penoze> Youtube is seriously a good way to make money

[6:25] <Misacorp> how many chunks are loaded into memory at any given moment

[7:10] <Einschtein|shower> The problem here is the missing of an IQ.

[7:10] <Quatroking> OG_CLAN, thats because this channel doesn't allow advertising ip servers

[7:10] <Quatroking> since that channel allows it, we refer people to it

[7:10] <LG_Legacy> Alrighjt

[7:10] <LG_Legacy> Better idea

[7:10] <LG_Legacy> OG_CLAN

[7:10] <LG_Legacy> I own that channel

[7:10] <LG_Legacy> I can do whatever the fuck i want with it.

[7:11] <LG_Legacy> If i ban you, i ban you. You contact ME about it.

[8:26] <garry> @muleformycash sorry mate.

[8:26] <Yushatak> explain what a water door is, and i can

[8:26] <muleformycash> Okay

[8:26] <Yushatak> or link me to whatever source you have

[8:28] <Yushatak> muleformycash: easy way to do that that i came up with - make a 1x1 lava moat around your house entrance, and make the entrance a 1x1 ladder hole.

[8:28] * Viral has quit: Quit: Leaving

[8:28] <Bobtree> Miclee: the Minecraft.net login is insecure. it's http, which means the password and username are sent as plaintext. it really needs to be https

[8:28] <Miclee> They aren't sent as plaintext

[8:28] <Miclee> It's encrypted

[8:28] <Bobtree> oh, how so?

[8:29] <Miclee> I'm not sure on the specifics, I just know it is.

[8:29] <Miclee> Juggernaut151, an hour and a half.

[8:29] * Juggernaut151-Phone has joined #minecraft.

[8:29] <Miclee> There's sort of a big timer on the front.

[8:29] <Yushatak> muleformycash: will watch and then come back to assist.

[8:30] <muleformycash> Okay

[8:30] * Tenk|DC has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[8:30] <muleformycash> You can skip through it

[8:30] <muleformycash> Most of it is excess

[8:30] <Juggernaut151-Phone> on my steam there is no timer...

[8:30] <Bobtree> Miclee: because the request is http, the contents can be easily intercepted

[8:30] <Miclee> Bobtree, yes, but when sent they are encrypted.

[8:31] <Bobtree> Miclee: doesn't matter, someone who has that login encrypted message can login as you

[8:31] <Miclee> No

[8:31] <Juggernaut151-Phone> who here plays age of conan? i do

[8:32] <Miclee> You can't login with the encrypted information.

[8:32] <Bobtree> I suppose they can't change your password without knowing the original

[8:32] <MadMockers> Yes you can miclee

[8:32] * Mapleleaf has joined #minecraft.

[8:32] <MadMockers> You just resend the encrypted packet.

[8:32] <Miclee> How so?

[8:32] <MadMockers> You don't have to know whats in it

[8:32] <Yushatak> oh.

[8:32] <Bobtree> because there's no way to know WHO sent it, only the contents

[8:32] <Yushatak> muleformycash: that's very simple.

[8:32] <Yushatak> muleformycash: what're ya having trouble with

[8:33] <Miclee> MadMockers, it's more of a session ID, so that session ID will have already been sent, and can not be sent again.

[8:33] * Ensiside has joined #minecraft.

[8:33] <MadMockers> Miclee: The encrypted information is what gets you the session ID

[8:33] * incandenza_ has joined #minecraft.

[8:33] <Miclee> The encrypted information includes the session ID.

[8:33] <MadMockers> I think bobtree is talking C2S

[8:33] <Bobtree> Miclee: imagine you send a postcard with encrypted info. anyone who sees it can copy the info, and send an identical postcard. they don't have to know what the original unencrypted message says

[8:34] <MadMockers> Miclee is talking S2C

[8:34] <Miclee> Yes, but Bob, nobody is going to go through that much trouble, trying to time when you're logging in

[8:34] <Yushatak> Bobtree: timestamps

[8:34] * dodson has joined #minecraft.

[8:34] <Miclee> Just so that they can get on your account

[8:34] <Miclee> and not even change the password

[8:34] <muleformycash> Yushatak, i keep going into the mine cart

[8:34] * Turnip199 has joined #minecraft.

[8:34] <Yushatak> Bobtree: if you encrypt the current date/time with an unknown cipher, resending it with the now-incorrect timestamp is worthless

[8:34] * Chase has joined #minecraft.

[8:34] <Miclee> ^@Yushatak

[8:34] <muleformycash> also when i place my rails they're vertical

[8:34] <Bobtree> Miclee: anybody on the same network can snoop for logins. just because it doesn't seem bad, doesn't mean there aren't more serious problems hiding

[8:35] <muleformycash> Yushatak, are you the person on your phone?

[8:35] * petercoulton_ has joined #minecraft.

[8:35] <MadMockers> As Yushatak points out, most login protocols include some bogus data which the server tells them to include at the end such that the end encryption is different

[8:35] <Miclee> If they're on the same network, yes, you can do that with pretty much any website.

[8:35] * Chase has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[8:35] <Yushatak> muleformycash: the rails is likely due to east-west vs north-south, try another wall of your house or add another track and then remove it to force the tracks to align how you want.

[8:35] <Yushatak> muleformycash: as for the problem itself, i think you're using it wrong

[8:35] <Miclee> Though, if they're on the same network as you, you can go and hit them.

[8:35] * Chase has joined #minecraft.

[8:35] <Miclee> SO problem solved.

[8:35] <Yushatak> muleformycash: you want to right click THROUGH the lava/water to the minecart on the other side

[8:36] <Bobtree> I'm not a web guy or security expert, but AFAIK, private info like logins should only be trusted to https or a likewise encrypted connection (VPN, etc)

[8:36] <muleformycash> oh

[8:36] <muleformycash> i have to right click?

[8:36] * Ensiside has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[8:36] <Yushatak> yes.

[8:36] <muleformycash> lol!

[8:36] <muleformycash> let me try that

[8:36] * Shwan has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[8:36] <JWilbur> The day a stalker finds my house by stealing my minecraft login...

[8:37] <MadMockers> Miclee: Err... yea they do, seeing as the one off login packet which is encrypted has pretty much no over head as it is the only packet which is encrypted

[8:37] * nnn has joined #minecraft.

[8:37] * Krysmace has joined #minecraft.

[8:37] <MadMockers> https for login, and everything else deals with the session ID on normal HTTP

[8:38] <Miclee> MadMockers, as said above, it also stores a timestamp

[8:38] * garry has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[8:38] <Miclee> if resent, timestamp is different

[8:38] <Miclee> Making it invalid

[8:38] <MadMockers> Miclee: ... Did you read what I said? This was a response to you noting that encryption for games is not required

[8:39] * Turnip199 has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[8:39] <Miclee> If you haven't noticed, most game companies do not use https for login.

[8:40] <MadMockers> name a notable one

[8:40] <Miclee> WoW's website.

[8:40] <MadMockers> No company worth buying from is going to risk the off chance of one of their clients accounts being stolen

[8:41] <Bobtree> WoW offers encryption fob dongles to prevent account theft. it becomes a big problem with a game that popular

[8:41] <MadMockers> I'm fairly sure battle.net encrypts the password client side before sending it

[8:41] <Miclee> Yes, as does minecraft.net

[8:41] <Miclee> We already established that.

[8:42] <Omega_Guardian> should use secure encryption for every sort of login stuff

[8:42] <Bobtree> and the battlecraft.net login I'm looking at is done in Flash

[8:42] <Miclee> They're all scared that their Minecraft account is going to be logged into

[8:42] <Miclee> in which the hacker can't even change the password.

[8:42] <MadMockers> Miclee: But why risk the reverse of the encryption when, like I have said, SSL has pretty much no over head for the one time you contact the server over SSL?

[8:42] <VioletPenguin> but... but... it's mine!

[8:42] <MadMockers> That's not my point, thats theirs

[8:42] <Miclee> MadMockers, I'm done arguing about this. It's pointless.

[8:43] <Miclee> You aren't seeing the point.

[8:43] <VioletPenguin> what are we arguing about this time?

[8:43] <MadMockers> My point is that there is no reason NOT to use SSL for sensitive game account informaion

[8:43] <Bobtree> it looks like this already happened a couple months ago: http://crafthub.net/2010/10/30/minecraft-accounts-breached-oh-this-is-bad/

[8:43] <Miclee> Bobtree, that's a bruteforcer

[8:43] <Miclee> Simply tries to login over and over

[8:43] <Bobtree> well, I don't follow Minecraft closely, and my presumption was it would happen sooner or later

[8:43] <clone1018> You can do that anywhere

[8:43] <VioletPenguin> if your pass can be cracked by brute force it's your own fault

[8:44] <muleformycash> but i dont want to get in trouble

[8:44] <Bobtree> VP: anything can be &#39cracked' by brute force, given enough time. the question is whether a dictionary attack works, or if the site has appropriate countermeasures (fail and time limits)

[8:45] <VioletPenguin> true.. but if you pass on avarage can be cracked within lets say a week it's your own fault

[8:50] <HelloIUseMibbit> The password minecraftforums would take 100 million years to crack.

[8:50] <SirWaddles> Is there any reason as to why my Minecraft Server, running on a Dedi Box with 4gb RAM etc etc which I have a ping of 40ms to, is extremely laggy?

[8:50] <Omega_Guardian> like number of letters, numbers, funky symbols

[8:51] <Juggernaut151> gonna eat

[8:51] <VioletPenguin> lol, my pc password is only 3 days

[8:51] <SirWaddles> It takes a notable second or two to open up inventory, workbench etc.

[8:53] <clone1018> thats my irc password

[8:54] <Miclee> Bruteforcing an IRC password is pointless.

[8:54] <clone1018> I use a different password for EVERYTHING :D

[8:54] <HelloIUseMibbit> News: I will no longer be using mIRC to connect here because mIRC disconnects me randomly.

[8:54] <Smarag> are you guys entering your paypal passwords into a random site o.o?

[8:54] <Smarag> Seriously?

[8:54] <Omega_Guardian> it had swedish language for me too, I went and used googles translate thing copy-pasting bits till I found where to change it

[8:55] <GLaDOS> >implying we give a shit

[8:55] <Miclee> No, smarag

[8:55] <Mattie2010> 9,571,860 nonillion years.

[8:55] <Miclee> That was my password for a random site.

[8:55] <Mattie2010> Holy shit

[8:55] <Smarag> I'm so making a "How secure is your password site."

[8:55] * JERorly has joined #minecraft.

[8:55] <Smarag> Miclee but VioletPenguin did.

[8:55] <Omega_Guardian> it's kinda buggered though why it doesn't just grab your browsers/os language :P

[8:55] <Yushatak> muleformycash: im back - any luck?

[8:55] * jDarius has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[8:55] <Miclee> Make it tell everyone it's secure.

[8:55] <Mattie2010> and it has a keylogger built in, smarag?

[8:55] <clone1018> How secure is your paypal username and password?

[8:55] <HelloIUseMibbit> Miclee: Bruteforcing an IRC password is pointless because the real owner can do a GHOST and regain the account.

[8:55] <VioletPenguin> your username? not, it's your email

[8:56] <Miclee> Whoever bruteforces can change the password

[8:56] <Smarag> Mattie2010 keylogger?

[8:56] <Smarag> Oh it's pure js.

[8:56] <Smarag> hm kay :/.

[8:56] <Miclee> It's pointless because the person can contact IRCops and get you akilled.

[8:56] <Omega_Guardian> better to avoid typing it in anyways I figure

[8:56] <JERorly> How long should it take for my payment to go through? I Bought beta at half 3

[8:56] <Miclee> JERorly, please wait 24 hours after your payment, as it can take that long for your account to be upgraded. If, after that time, you account is still not upgraded, please send an e-mail to payment@mojang.com.

[8:56] <Smarag> JERorly usually 1min- 10 mins. Sometimes a day.

[8:56] <JERorly> Okay, thank you

[8:57] <HelloIUseMibbit> Then the owner can report the person to the IRCops and get a Kline on the bruteforcer.

[8:57] * JibbaJabbah has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[8:57] <HelloIUseMibbit> And get his akill removed.

[8:57] <Miclee> I already said that, HelloIUseMibbit.

[8:57] <MadMockers> NickServ prolly has bruteforce protection neway

[8:57] <Miclee> I wasn't referring to the bruteforcer contacting IRCops

[9:01] <Aristos> Hello

[9:01] <Mattie2010> goodbye.

[9:01] <Aristos> Here

[9:01] <Aristos> Or notch :P

[9:01] <Miclee> Why, Aristos?

[9:01] <Aristos> I have a question

[9:01] <MissingNo> About 42 quadrillion years -- for my minecraft password

[9:02] <Aristos> Well

[9:02] <Aristos> I have an account in hostmosnter.com

[9:02] <Aristos> I got a dedicated ip

[9:02] <Aristos> and 1 ingoing and 1 outgoing port opened

[9:02] <clone1018> HostMonster lacks

[9:02] <Aristos> I want to host minecraft using that ip

[9:02] <HelloIUseMibbit> Should I start a user database, or a chat log database?

[9:02] <Aristos> Lacks?

[9:02] <Miclee> You'll need to set up a VPS and such, will you not?

[9:02] <Mattie2010> 9,571,860 nonillion years is the highest I can get on the secure password game

[9:02] <Aristos> I guess

[9:02] * buddy1987 has joined #minecraft.

[9:02] * JERorly has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[9:03] <clone1018> Its webhosting

[9:03] <Aristos> But there isnt any way to get it made?

[9:03] <Yushatak> Aristos: so forward it to your home ip (if you JUST want the IP, not the server), or else u need vps/dedibox

[9:03] * Chrissi has joined #minecraft.

[9:03] * klusark has joined #minecraft.

[9:03] <Aristos> How can i get a vps etc

[9:03] <Aristos> From the server , correct?

[9:03] <Spinkzeit1> Buy it

[9:03] <buddy1987> got a question...

[9:03] <Miclee> Aristos, you'll need to find somewhere that hosts VPSes.

[9:03] <Aristos> Ahh i see..

[9:03] <clone1018> I recommend HazeNet at http://goo.gl/VA68Z

[9:03] <Aristos> I should of asked you first.

[9:03] <Aristos> Should of came here first xD

[9:04] <clone1018> Use 50OFFXMAS2010 and get 50% off ;D

[9:04] <Aristos> Anyways , if i just want to use the ip

[9:04] <clone1018> Forever

[9:04] <SirWaddles> I thought this site was pretty good

[9:04] <Aristos> Does that make it lag less in any way?

[9:04] <Smarag> Arsitos not at all

[9:04] <Smarag> Aristos not at all

[9:04] <nappa> is there a problem with purchasing the game?

[9:04] * zoke has joined #minecraft.

[9:04] <Aristos> I see

[9:04] <nappa> I paid for it via paypal hours ago yet the site still doesnt let me play

[9:04] <clone1018> Thats crap SirWaddles

[9:04] <Notcoo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4oB28ksiIo

[9:04] <Miclee> Nappa, please wait 24 hours after your payment, as it can take that long for your account to be upgraded. If, after that time, you account is still not upgraded, please send an e-mail to payment@mojang.com.

[9:04] <Aristos> Any VPS that i can install into hostmonster?

[9:04] <Tekk> clone1018, how long has hazenet been around?

[9:04] <Notcoo> Don' steal a hackers comp

[9:04] <Smarag> Aristos it doesn't have to do with dedicated... dedicated tells you something abotu the server

[9:04] <buddy1987> I just started a classic server.... what is the best mod pack to get and where can I get them? I want to appoint a ranking system and add fly and cuboid abilities.etc

[9:04] <Miclee> Oh, I love /payment $1

[9:05] <clone1018> 6 months Tekk.

[9:05] <Tekk> i guess I mean how likely are they to fall off the face of the earth?

[9:05] <nappa> well that's bullshit

[9:05] <clone1018> I dont think very likely

[9:05] <Miclee> No, that's life.

[9:05] <Tekk> alright, awesome

[9:05] <Miclee> Things take time

[9:05] <Miclee> be patient

[9:05] <nappa> that's crappy service

[9:05] <Tekk> need a secondary VPS

[9:05] <Miclee> No

[9:05] * Oddtwang has joined #minecraft.

[9:05] <clone1018> I've been with them for awhile. And they've never slowed down

[9:05] <Smarag> Aristos a dedicated server is a whole serve just running your stuff. A vps s are "virtual private servers" on a dedicated server

[9:05] <Smarag> *very powerfull dedicated server

[9:05] <Miclee> If you complain about a 24 hour wait, something is indeed wrong with you.

[9:05] * GTASAchampion has joined #minecraft.

[9:06] <Aristos> Can i get a vps on my dedicated or do i have to go get s completly different host for a vps dedicated server

[9:06] * zoke has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[9:06] <buddy1987> does anyone know which mod packs are the best to put on a classic server?

[9:06] <Smarag> Aristos you don't need a vps if you have a dedicated server o.o

[9:06] <nappa> Miclee, every other (even indie) game I have ever purchased virtually have been available immediately

[9:06] * TheBeefiest has joined #minecraft.

[9:06] * SirWaddles has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[9:06] <nappa> I don't see how it can be difficult to just unlock it automatically

[9:06] <Miclee> Yes, but they don't use the same sort of system as Minecraft.

[9:06] <Aristos> Ok lets just start over

[9:06] <Aristos> Ima tell you what i got

[9:06] * GTASAchampion has quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer

[9:06] <Smarag> And if you have a dedicated server (they usually cost starting fromn $70 /month) you should know all that stuff o.o

[9:06] <Aristos> I got a dedicated ip on hostmonster, with ports 25565 and 25566 open

[9:06] <Miclee> Minecraft uses an account system, and it takes time for it to go through and upgrade each account.

[9:06] * TestDummy has joined #minecraft.

[9:07] <nappa> miclee, well then maybe minecraft shouldnt use it either

[9:07] <Miclee> It has to.

[9:07] <Miclee> What other system would it use?

[9:07] <nappa> idk i dont make games

[9:07] <Aristos> I am aware hostmonster is a webhost btw i own 2 websites but just checking if i could use it instead of buying another server etc

[9:07] <Miclee> >people complaining about things they don't understand.

[9:07] <Miclee> Fun.

[9:07] <Smarag> Yeah. Its just an IP. It's just as if you get a domain.

[9:07] <VioletPenguin> a random premium generator, making a random account premium with every payment?

[9:07] <Lorax> normal

[9:07] <nappa> but every other WEBSITE (not just a game) that i've ever transfered money to via paypal has recognized the money transfer in a matter of minutes

[9:07] <nappa> how is minecraft different

[9:08] <Aristos> So i have to get s server, an ip wont work

[9:08] <Miclee> It has to process everything.

[9:08] <nappa> miclee, so you need to be a mechanic to complain when a brand new car doesn't start?

[9:08] <Miclee> Now, as I said

[9:08] <Miclee> nappa, please wait 24 hours after your payment, as it can take that long for your account to be upgraded. If, after that time, you account is still not upgraded, please send an e-mail to payment@mojang.com.

[9:08] <Aristos> Cant in any way place it in my website servers, correct?

[9:08] <Miclee> Now stop complaining.

[9:08] * incandenza_ has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[9:08] <Smarag> nappa minecraft does that as well. But paypal has something like a queque and if people buy minecraft too fast the queque fills up and takes longer.

[9:08] <Lorax> I got mine instantly, so the experience varies.

[9:08] <Smarag> Aristos depends on.

[9:08] <muleformycash> lol

[9:08] <muleformycash> my lava door just burned my whole house down

[9:08] <KimKandor> both mine with paypal were instant

[9:08] <muleformycash> :)

[9:08] <Lorax> lava door?

[9:08] <Smarag> Aristos what kind of hosting do you have o.o? a VPS? A dedicated Server? Shared hosting?

[9:08] <TheBeefiest> how is it different? selling 10,000 copies per second perhaps

[9:09] <Aristos> Dedicated

[9:09] <Lorax> I haven't tried yet, but can you control water flow with doors, or do they get destroyed?

[9:09] <Aristos> It was shared, but i upgraded to dedicated

I have nothing left to do.

[9:09] <Miclee> That's not beat.

[9:09] <Miclee> You have to hunt down the pigman lord.

[9:10] <GLaDOS> Nanobot: far from beat

[9:10] <Miclee> And you need to capture the dragon.

[9:13] <Smarag> and that's only for some players.

[9:13] <Aristos> I should have over that ram

[9:25] <Aristos> That a server needs to host a non-laggy minecraft server

[9:25] <Aristos> You said 2/3gb ram

[9:25] <Yushatak> Esdee: would work better with hispanic people - they swim well.

[9:26] <clone1018> Hey GLaDOS. I totally need to talk to you

[9:26] <Smarag> I dunno &#39bout the cpu shit but I think most severs should be able to run it.

[9:26] <GLaDOS> hmm?

[9:26] <Lorax> no, to get that screenshot I have to exit minecraft and do something with the c&p buffer

[9:26] <paradroid> alt-f4

[9:26] <Aristos> smarag glados this counts as an fps game server , correct?

[9:27] <Yushatak> Lorax: well i&#39d recommend FRAPS then, but if you're on Mac/linux or too lazy to get fraps, then yes, you need to wait

[9:27] <Lorax> as minecraft crashes if it is fullscreen, the best solution is an in-game capability. :)

[9:27] <Smarag> Aristos I dunno. I would say yes,

[9:27] <VioletPenguin> alt f4 fixes all problems, always

[9:27] <Esdee> BIG GULPS HUH

[9:37] * Ensiside has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[9:37] <bentheexo> Aristos a big part of the lag issue is due to how the MC Server has a ballooning memory requirement

[9:37] <GoMySQL> bentheexo, that's why when you run a minecraft host, you maintain all control.

[9:37] <Aristos> i am there

[9:41] <GreyVulpine> Mojang is not steam

[9:41] <Smarag> cuz this is an indie dev.

[9:49] <Veg> and i'm still stuck

[9:49] <GoMySQL> My server is great and it's up.. but i run alpha.

[9:49] <TheBeefiest> yes but to be realistic, its not like he is going to get fucked over and forgot about, it will get fixed eventually

[9:49] <GoMySQL> Fuck this beta business.

[9:50] <Smarag> argh

[9:50] <Smarag> I mean TheBeefiest

[9:50] <GoMySQL> Not with all my mods it doesn't.

[9:50] <tek2974> if i told the bank i&#39d pay my mortgage back eventually they&#39d repo my house

[9:50] <clone1018> 98/131

[9:50] <clone1018> GRR. Hurry up

[9:50] * S_Trunks is enjoying his high-fiber breakfast

[9:50] <Smarag> yeah. If he is waiting since 3 weeks that definitely /not/ okay.

[9:50] <TheBeefiest> right so you compare a multi billion dollar company vs a 5 million dollar comaby

[9:50] <TheBeefiest> company

[9:50] <Tramp1234> Anyone know of a good Beta Server?

[9:50] <GreyVulpine> tek2974 - Try banking in real life, You take money out, the bank will give you your money immediately. Try depositing and expecting money to be there immediately.

[9:50] <Juggerna_> nope

[9:51] <GreyVulpine> Doesn't happen.

[9:51] <Smarag> TheBeefiest 8.5 mio. or 4 mio without taxes :P.

[9:51] <tek2974> at mine it does

[9:51] * KungFuHamster has joined #minecraft.

[9:51] <tek2974> don't know what kind of crap bank you use

[9:51] <GreyVulpine> This is every bank.

[9:51] <bentheexo> My band deposits the money instantly whenever I go so long as I get there before they close at 5pm

[9:51] * Tramp1234 has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[9:51] <GoMySQL> My money is available immediately.

[9:51] <S_Trunks> Which companies are you guys talking about?

[9:51] <mbentley> damn, negative nancy...

[9:51] <tek2974> even at the ATM mine is instantly transferred to my account

[9:51] <Smarag> and it doesn't take the bank 3 weeks. You guys are insane if you think that's okay o.o

[9:51] <tek2974> try Wachovia some time

[9:51] <S_Trunks> which is now wells fargo

[9:51] <GoMySQL> In the end, it comes down to this;

[9:51] <TheBeefiest> i deposited a GOVERNMENT check once, and they kept it for 2 weeks

[9:51] <bentheexo> I despise Wachovia

[9:52] <GoMySQL> Product was paid for, access to that product was not granted. Queue angry face. Legitimate angry face.

[9:52] <S_Trunks> Normally, you can get cash from a check if you have the equivilant or more in your account

[9:52] <tek2974> then deal w/ your crappy bank, I put my paycheck into the atm at midnight and it scans it, by the time i get home 5 minutes later and log into my account on my computer it's already in

[9:52] * Midvalley^gerber has joined #minecraft.

[9:52] <bentheexo> I use Green Bank

[9:52] <mbentley> arguing with people who are volunteering to try to help won't solve your problem

[9:52] <mbentley> just sayin

[9:52] <GoMySQL> The end point is: No one in this channel can help.

[9:52] * Splizes2 has joined #minecraft.

[9:52] <TheBeefiest> anyway, i am not supporting the fact that they fucked up, i am just saying that bitching and whining wont make anything faster

[9:52] <S_Trunks> Just stay away from BoA

[9:53] <GoMySQL> TheBeefiest, makes people feel better.

[9:53] * Midvalley^gerber has quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer

[9:53] <bentheexo> BoA did

[9:53] <Veg> i just needed some advice

[9:53] * Splizes has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[9:53] <TheBeefiest> not me, if someone fucks me over like that then i just write them off as never doing business with them again

[9:53] <tek2974> hard horror stories about them

[9:53] <Yushatak> tek2974: is wachovia open on sunday/saturday/etc.?

[9:53] <S_Trunks> BoA leaves you SOL and a DiA

[9:53] <Smarag> Veg did ou tried contacting him on twitter?

[9:53] <tek2974> yeah

[9:53] <S_Trunks> Sat until noon

[9:53] <tek2974> well depends on the office

[9:54] <Smarag> *you

[9:54] <tek2974> in hanover they're open on sun, but not in my current town

[9:54] <Veg> no because i can't use twitter

[9:54] <Yushatak> tek2974: do they have a minimum amount of money that you have to have in the account?

[9:54] <tek2974> nope

[9:54] <Smarag> Yushatak we are talking about 3 weeks. Three weeks. Not days.

[9:54] <Yushatak> tek2974: perhaps ill change.

[9:54] * clone1018 has quit: Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by clone1018_))

[9:54] * clone1018_ is now known as clone1018.

[9:54] <Smarag> Yushatak they should be open in that periode at least once.

[9:54] <Yushatak> Smarag: ...?

[9:54] <Yushatak> Smarag: im just asking questions about wachovia.

[9:54] <bentheexo> Unfortunately My bank is only a regional type of bank, but they have the drive thru open until 7pm even though they close the lobby at 5pm

[9:54] <Yushatak> Smarag: im not 100% happy with TD

[9:54] <tek2974> and if you do keep a minimum (forget what it is) you get a free safe deposit box

[9:54] <Yushatak> Smarag: thinking about alternative

[9:54] <Smarag> oh lol kay...

[9:55] <TheBeefiest> it is a horribly disturbing trend though to sell alpha or beta games.... i am happy with this purchase and frozen synapse.... but cortex command was a huge fuckover to everyone who bought that

[9:55] <S_Trunks> Credit Unions! Not for profits "banks"

[9:55] <tek2974> free online banking, free debt card, etc etc

[9:55] <Yushatak> TD is holding $100 of my money captive

[9:55] <Yushatak> and it annoys me.

[9:55] * EdGruberman has joined #minecraft.

[9:55] <Quatroking> why is TestDummy holding 100 bucks captive from you

[9:55] <bentheexo> EdGruberman is here, everyone boot to his head

[9:55] <Quatroking> I mean, I know he's evil and a criminal and all ofthat

[9:55] <Yushatak> u know full well i do not refer to a user, but because it's a minimum balance

[9:55] <Quatroking> but why would he do that

[9:55] <S_Trunks> quatroking: for nefarious details

[9:55] * houka has joined #minecraft.

[9:55] <GoMySQL> TheBeefiest, CC was (is!) a completely unplayable game.

[9:55] <Yushatak> and if i drop below it they take away money i dont have

[9:56] <Yushatak> and make my money negative

[9:56] <Yushatak> and then rinse and repeat

[9:56] * Aal has joined #minecraft.

[9:56] <Yushatak> until they feel like letting me know it happened

[9:56] <Yushatak> or i notice

[9:56] <GoMySQL> Banks also do something else awesome:

[9:56] <GoMySQL> they order withdrawls from highest amount to lowest so they can ding you for overdraft as many times as possible.

[9:56] <bentheexo> banks insure your money up to 100,000 where Credit Unions do not usually

[9:56] <GoMySQL> ALL banks do it.. It's SOP.

[9:56] * GLaDOS is now known as ``.

[9:56] <Yushatak> one time i got charged $40 for letting my account drop below the minimum for less than 24 hours by about 20 cents.

[9:56] <houka> mmk

[9:57] <S_Trunks> Yushatak: You might get a kick outta this: http://vimeo.com/4807598

[9:57] <Yushatak> that was some bullshit.

[9:57] <Veg> GoMySQL I'm actually a pretty intense CC fan, but i can see where you're coming from about it being unplayable

[9:57] * Yushatak watches

[9:57] <tek2974> oh, i have od protection from wachovia, if you od they just take it out of your savings instead w/ no extra charges

[9:57] <GoMySQL> Yush, did you bother calling and pitching a fit?

[9:57] <Yushatak> i want a bank that works like an RTS game resource pile

[9:57] <S_Trunks> lol

[9:57] <Yushatak> so that i can put stuff in, and it wont let me take stuff out if it isnt there

[9:57] <Yushatak> it will just go "erm... no moneys"

[9:57] <Juggernaut151> CC?

[9:57] <Yushatak> and etc.

[9:58] <houka> wow did not think this irc would have so much talking in it

[9:58] <bentheexo> I have ODP turned off on my bank account so I don't have that worry and considering that I have no minimum required amount

[9:58] <Quatroking> :)

[9:59] <S_Trunks> lol

[9:59] <tek2974> there ya go

[9:59] <houka> well minecraft is a pretty big game now i remember back in December 09

[9:59] <Yushatak> :)

[9:59] <bentheexo> I'm not a big slackware fan although I love me some SLES

[9:59] <houka> it was fun back then and the one year i seen it grow it has gone alot since then

[9:59] <Patrickahn> Sorry guys I'm new, but it is not unusual to wait after payment to be allowed to play is it?

[9:59] <GoMySQL> I <3 CentOS

[9:59] <TheBeefiest> yeah cortex command is an amazing idea, but when he makes a bunch of money, then decides to just fuck off and release miniscule crap every 1.5 years as releases, then its clearly an evil situation, he is just selling the IDEA of a good game, not a good game

[10:00] <Yushatak> Patrickahn: at least 24 hours is normal

[10:00] <GoMySQL> And anyone that likes slackware is an odd little monkey that should be shot.

[10:00] <Visiiri> houka, I remember back in May 09

[10:00] <Yushatak> Patrickahn: if you're lucky its immediate, if you're not it's a week

[10:00] <Aal> this slack box has 800+ days uptime ;)

[10:00] <houka> cool

[10:00] <bentheexo> All my dedicateds run CentOS 5.5, and if I could get a RHEL 6.0 I would be even happier

[10:00] <tek2974> I like ubuntu for everyday crap on my laptop, but i'm partial to backtrack

[10:00] <GoMySQL> I have a windows server at work with ~1700 days uptime.

[10:00] <Veg> Yushatak so how unlucky am i then?

[10:01] <S_Trunks> goMySQL: somewhere, a native american is crying

[10:01] <Yushatak> Veg: depends on how long it took u to get ur account going? mine took like 30 hours

[10:01] <TheBeefiest> a windows server that has never been restarted?? that sounds impossible

[10:01] <Yushatak> S_Trunks: somewhere, i don't care.

[10:01] <S_Trunks> lol

[10:01] <bentheexo> My biggest uptime so far since was 543 days since I had to take it down to do some work on it's Xen kernel

[10:01] <Veg> Yushatak it isn't going yet and i payed on the 2nd December

[10:01] <TheBeefiest> they make you restart with updates, and updates are like twice a month arent they?

[10:01] <GoMySQL> People talk shit about Windows boxen, but the damn things are solid as rocks.

[10:02] <Yushatak> GoMySQL: truth.

[10:02] <GoMySQL> If your admin is a flaming shitpile, your server will be rebooted hourly.

[10:02] <TheBeefiest> oh shit is the steam sale over

[10:02] <houka> Visiiri, so do you like where the game is going so far

[10:02] <tek2974> fail admins make servers like the minecraft account server

[10:02] <Yushatak> TheBeefiest: no, just yesterday's

[10:02] <tek2974> :-P

[10:02] <Visiiri> houka, not enough pruple cloth. :P

[10:02] <Yushatak> BATTLEFIELD 2 IS FINALLY $5

[10:02] * Yushatak rings a giant bell

[10:02] <bentheexo> I do reboots on most of my servers every month just for kernel updates

[10:02] <Yushatak> im finally going to buy it

[10:02] <Yushatak> it deserves my money at long last

[10:02] <Yushatak> :O

[10:02] <houka> Visiiri, meh i wish he would add dye

[10:02] <TheBeefiest> bf2 or bad company 2?

[10:02] <Visiiri> Yeah, me too

[10:03] <Yushatak> bf2/

[10:03] <Yushatak> not bc2

[10:03] <Aal> GoMySQL: problem with windows and development is... there are to many incompetent people working in ict.. windows is like hard to keep clean, and when you have problems debugging takes ages

[10:03] <GoMySQL> Aal, I concur.

[10:03] <tek2974> .......might actually buy borderlands now

[10:03] <Bob> Don't know how old mc is, but did notch give away codes previous christmas/newyear?

[10:03] <Yushatak> i bought it but it's DLCs were too expensive

[10:03] <GoMySQL> IIS mudhole stomps apache. But that's not terribly difficult. apache is a beast. I'm thinking of swinging over to Cherokee or Lighty.

[10:03] <houka> i use to email nocth about what he was going to do but he stop sending back

[10:04] <Yushatak> Bob: he had a temporary period of freeplay

[10:04] <tek2974> dlc's are 50% off now too

[10:04] <Yushatak> Bob: not permanent codes/etc

[10:04] <shadoom> borderlands is so horribly boring :(

[10:04] <Yushatak> tek2974: still too expensive.

[10:04] <Yushatak> shadoom: i liked it until i realized that the end just kinda tapered off like they ran out of money

[10:04] <bentheexo> nginx is good so long as you don't skimp on memory

[10:04] <GoMySQL> shadoom: +1

[10:04] * Morde has quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer

[10:04] <shadoom> yeah the end was like wtf ?

[10:04] <tek2974> meh it's fun, i like the diablo based weapons generator

[10:04] <shadoom> thats it?

[10:04] <Yushatak> "THE VAULT! THE VAULT!"

[10:04] <Bob> ok, thx yushatak.

[10:04] <TheBeefiest> did they implement tactical planning for any of the newer ghost recon games

[10:04] <GoMySQL> bentheexo, yeah? I've never messed with nginx

[10:04] <Yushatak> there's no vault!

[10:04] * houka going to eat

[10:04] <Yushatak> SPOILER!

[10:04] <Yushatak> no vault thing in borderlands

[10:04] <tek2974> meh, it's all about the dlc

[10:04] <Yushatak> its not real

[10:04] <Yushatak> :/

[10:04] * JoeJoe has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[10:04] <GoMySQL> Is the config of nginx a pain in the ass or is it pretty good?

[10:04] <bentheexo> its decently complex

[10:05] <Veg> well, bye guys

[10:05] <tek2974> yeah the ending was disappointing

[10:05] <bentheexo> not complicated just complex

[10:05] <tek2974> cya veg good luck

[10:05] <GoMySQL> More or less complex than apache/lighty?

[10:05] * Veg has quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client

[10:05] <Bob> borderlands was okay. Not as good as diablo 2 though. (yeah yeah, different gametypes, :p)

[10:05] <Yushatak> Bob: they're kindred in a way.

[10:05] <bentheexo> lighty and apache i can do with my eyes closed

[10:05] <csharp> borderlands was fun for a moment, then it just became boring

[10:05] <Yushatak> Bob: i thought of it as FPS d2

[10:05] <Yushatak> i loved it for about two weeks

[10:05] <bentheexo> nginx is a build over apache using mod_proxy

[10:05] <GoMySQL> gotta keep an eye open with nginx? :D

[10:05] <Bob> they are, I agree. But so far, even titan quest wasn't as good as d2.

[10:05] <Yushatak> then i never played it again.

[10:05] <csharp> we played it like 4hours with my friend :P

[10:05] <Bob> No idea why.

[10:05] <GoMySQL> Ahhh.

[10:05] <Yushatak> Bob: but it's the next best thing

[10:05] <Yushatak> Bob: :D

[10:05] * Catachan has joined #minecraft.

[10:05] <tek2974> played the shit out of borderlands, my friend and i two man crawmerax

[10:05] <GoMySQL> I think I'm going to give Cherokee a chance again.

[10:06] <Bob> Played diablo 2 for 7 years.

[10:06] <Yushatak> i know why, bob

[10:06] <GoMySQL> It was decent when i tried it a year ago.

[10:06] <Yushatak> cuz d2 is two dimensional

[10:06] <Yushatak> 3d just can't capture the same charm

[10:06] * revenant has quit: Quit: revenant

[10:06] <Yushatak> the same feel

[10:06] <bentheexo> it is a great deal more stable and secure and offers better dos protection than most things

[10:06] <Bob> That might be it, same reason why d3 is not going to be awesome.

[10:06] <tek2974> duke nukem forever will

[10:06] <Yushatak> yeah but it will be better than titan quest

[10:06] <Yushatak> and still good

[10:06] <GoMySQL> I like the idea of cherokees on-demand web-based interface for configuration.

[10:09] <bentheexo> nice

[10:09] <Bob> Never bought a ps3, can't justify that price for so little games of interest.

[10:12] <houka> my online name use to be E

[10:12] <bentheexo> it does mx server black listing and about 90% of all apache based servers use it for black listing

[10:12] <Bob> Well, couple of simple rules, the richest people can never make more than 20 times what the poorest person on earth earns. And boom, every single problem in the world is solved.

[10:13] <Bob> Now to convince the people who have money... right...

[10:13] <S_Trunks> I can't make $50 a year?

[10:13] * Chrisknyfe has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[10:13] <Bob> Well see, the rest would also earn more, so the contrast would be lower.

[10:13] <TheBeefiest> trunk think about it, if you wanted to make more, then you would find a way to pay the smaller guy

[10:13] <Bob> exactly

[10:13] <S_Trunks> Unfortunately, cost of living in different countries would cause the world, as a whole, to get poorer if we used that logic

[10:14] <Bob> a baseline of income.

[10:14] <GoMySQL> afk; configuring lighty.

[10:14] <TheBeefiest> not poorer as a whole, less extremist as a whole

[10:14] * Faustie has quit: Quit: Taken out by a man wearing a polyester ball-cup wielding a blue salmon.

[10:14] <Bob> Poorer yes, but think of this. More people with income = more people with disposable income, richer people = less kids.

[10:14] <clone1018> Urgh

[10:14] <TheBeefiest> but yes it would suck the most for western civilization and benefit the most to the poorest of countries

[10:14] <houka> the poorest person on earth gets 7 zimbabwean dollar's

[10:16] * KimKandor has joined #minecraft.

[10:16] <xales> Bob: if he makes more than 10 bucks an hour then he can get paid more by spending time uninstalling :)

[10:16] <clone1018> I dont get paid D:

[10:16] * SelbramWolf has joined #minecraft.

[10:16] <S_Trunks> Also, even know you would be right to, you can't assume that people with disposable income are going to spend it. Just look at the chinese

[10:16] <Bob> Not if you get paid because people advertised you as fast?

[10:16] * JoeJoe has joined #minecraft.

[10:17] <Bob> Chinese still don't make western type of wages. Some do, and those people have the same percentage as spending as the west.

[11:42] <macintoshhelper> justin_: with what?

[11:42] <justin_> creating a server on ubuntu

[11:43] * Bob logs onto macintoshhelper's "server". He knows he loves it.

[11:43] <macintoshhelper> Bob: Yes you'll love it when you get banned ^ _ ^

[11:43] <justin_> macintoshhelper: can you help me create a server

[11:44] <macintoshhelper> justin_: Well you need good firewall protection and antivirus

[11:44] <Bob> Don't even have mc online, so chillax.

[11:44] <justin_> macintoshhelper: i am on ubuntu

[11:44] <rcfreak0> justin_, download the minecraft_server.jar to home folder and run java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui

[11:44] <macintoshhelper> justin_: Ok Ubuntu is secure

[11:44] <justin_> rcfreak0: i cant connect to it

[11:44] <macintoshhelper> justin_: how much ram you got?

[11:44] <justin_> macintoshhelper: 6 gbs

[11:44] <rcfreak0> forward the ports correctly?

[11:44] <justin_> rcfreak0: i am not sure

[11:45] <macintoshhelper> justin_: Run java -Xmx4096M -Xms4096M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogu

[11:45] <Tsathoggua_Box> Anyways, in m dream. I made vortigaunts spawn.

[11:45] <macintoshhelper> justin_: if you run that you will let your server run 4gig ram

[11:45] <clone1018> If you need help with Minecraft Servers please go to #mcserver

[11:45] <Tsathoggua_Box> Except I set a secret value, which made them float around meditating at their enemies. And I made them hostile to me.

[11:45] <macintoshhelper> justin_: You can ONLY connect to your local ip

[11:45] <Aal> i got my new pc today... tried minecraft and got a semi-hardon :D lol now doing the afterplay :)

[11:45] <macintoshhelper> justin_: Others can connect to your external ip but you can't

[11:45] <justin_> wait what

[11:45] <Shrub> Tsathoggua :D

[11:46] <Tsathoggua_Box> They had an eat attack. Where you had to move your camera through the top of their... spine. Which was a simple, multicolor 3D model of a spine

[11:46] <justin_> i started the server

[11:46] <Tsathoggua_Box> You were spawned farther down in if you actually ran through them

[11:46] <justin_> failed to bind port

[11:47] <TestDummy> ^

[11:55] <Piehti> fusurugi Thats it? Nothing more?

[11:55] <Bob> cannons as well

[11:55] <Count> I want spiders that drop string :/

[11:56] <fusurugi> its a stone block?

[11:56] <somnambulanon> very small rocks.

[11:56] <fusurugi> so what.

[11:56] <VioletPenguin> ah yes... cannons

[11:56] <somnambulanon> churches, churches!

[11:56] <Smarag> count we already have that o.o?

[11:56] <Piehti> Well Iron is a Block too, but u can transform is into shiny armors, so what?

[11:56] <Piehti> :D

[11:56] <Ryl> What we need are giant portals you can send large items and vehicles through...

[11:56] <VioletPenguin> I want sheep to drop spiders

[11:56] <Count> you're taking me too literally Smarag

[11:56] <VioletPenguin> like death stars

[11:56] <Smarag> mhm :/

[11:57] * Plornt has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[11:57] <Count> ie, spiders aren't dropping string for me, therefore I want spiders that drop string

[11:57] <VioletPenguin> it's looking at me... STRAIGHT AT ME!! OH DEAR GOD!!!

[11:57] <fusurugi> i want to craft 9 string from one block of wool

[11:57] <macintoshhelper> Count: Not all spiders drop string, it is random which do

[11:57] <somnambulanon> just go find some dungeons, their chests usually ahve string

[11:57] <Ryl> You could make a river that goes through a portal, flows through the Nether, and comes out into another body of water at the destination, seemlessly travelling through it on a boat.

[11:57] <Ryl> That would be cool.

[11:57] <VioletPenguin> http://hijinksensue.com/

[11:57] <Count> I&#39d be happy with one string from 9 blocks of wool

[11:58] <VioletPenguin> nope... wrong word

[11:58] * PhonicUK has joined #minecraft.

[11:58] <somnambulanon> bloodstone, lightstone, and slow stone

[11:58] <Bob> Piehti: pigmen.

[11:58] <Bob> farm pigmen.

[11:58] <somnambulanon> and fire... they have lots of fire there.

[11:58] <Piehti> Is it tough down there?

[11:58] <macintoshhelper> Piehti: The Nether is got lots of Lava and new mobs like ghosts that kill you fast and they fly

[11:58] <Miclee> Bob, those are zombie pigmen, not pigmen

[11:58] <Ryl> The Nether is the Hell dimension that you must pass through to use portals =P

[11:58] <Miclee> Pigmen are entirely different.

[11:58] * Jupitersio has joined #minecraft.

[11:58] <somnambulanon> bloodstone is nice because when you light it on fire, it stays on fire.

[11:59] <Ryl> It's much more dangerous in there than anywhere else in the game.... unless you're good at moving fast and doging.

[11:59] <Smarag> yeah yeah Miclee we know.

[11:59] <Piehti> Well thanks. Enough. Nether is waiting.

[11:59] <Smarag> We wil still call them Pigmen <o<. Because Zombie Bigmen is too big to type out.

[11:59] <Smarag> yeah.

[11:59] <Bob> Seems like several dozens of people are watching reddit for codes. Last one was gone after 30 seconds :p

[11:59] <Smarag> We know. And we don't care =P.

[11:59] <somnambulanon> lol

[11:59] <Miclee> I do care.

[11:59] <VioletPenguin> and every time Miclee gets sad...

[11:59] <Ryl> Codes?

[11:59] <Smarag> Once we get real Pigmen we can call them zPigmen...

[12:00] <Ryl> ^ This

[13:08] <Notcoo> I troll xales all the time... and he trolls me ... getting kicked for that is a little insane.. its just fun no one gets hurt

[13:08] <Zerim> I always made acrobatics a major skill. ALWAYS.

[13:08] <Zerim> Super fast leveling, and I looove jumping.

[13:08] <Yushatak> proof that old games can still keep up as long as they get updated

[13:08] * revenant has joined #minecraft.

[13:08] <Tsathoggua_Box> until I man up and make a new character, but lose my progress on "admire every argonian female to 100% disposition"

[13:08] <Yushatak> lizard chix

[13:08] <Tsathoggua_Box> Yushatak, have you seen quake, man?

[13:08] <Thugaim> Can someone who is very kind hearted, and in the Christmas spirit, PM me?

[13:08] <Yushatak> Tsathoggua_Box: ?

[13:08] <Zerim> Yushatak, but then it stops being the original game. YOu know how you can upgrade a computer, yeah

[13:08] <Yushatak> Tsathoggua_Box: quake 1?

[13:08] * MissingNo has joined #minecraft.

[13:08] * MissingNo has quit: Remote host closed the connection

[13:09] <Yushatak> Zerim: i disagree with that anology, because gameplay stays the same on a game as you upgrade it visually

[13:09] <Notcoo> Yushatak have you done another video?

[13:09] <Tsathoggua_Box> technically q1 is just "quake 1 engine"

[13:09] <Yushatak> Notcoo: i redid episode 3, accidentally had uploaded half of it

[13:09] <Yushatak> Notcoo: and yes, i then did episode 4

[13:09] <Zerim> Yushatak, go into a Morrowind cave after changing the graphics and tell me that

[13:10] <Tsathoggua_Box> and id tech 5 uses a lot of stuff taken from id tech 4

[13:10] <Thugaim> Fml.

[13:10] <Zerim> Thugaim, go get some digital money. lolz.

[13:10] <Yushatak> true, but it's a different game

[13:10] <TestDummy> Thugaim: umad?

[13:10] <Tsathoggua_Box> id tech 6 apparently will use voxels in an octree.

[13:10] <Yushatak> if you put quake on that engine

[13:10] <Yushatak> then i&#39d call it quake.

[13:10] <Tsathoggua_Box> Yushatak, BUT YOU CAN

[13:10] <Notcoo> Yushatak you need more piggies in your videos

[13:10] <Tsathoggua_Box> and someone did iirc no wait

[13:22] <Vidi> they're not the nicest experience

[13:22] <ak> but its not like.. what i would call a disease

[13:22] <TestDummy> justin_: What do you think?

[13:22] <Glizbane> how long are we supposed to wait?

[13:22] <ak> to get anything done

[13:22] <Vidi> I have AS, it's not a disease.. it's the way a person is IMO

[13:22] <Yushatak> Notcoo: it's not even insulting, it's just so immature i don't acknowledge you saying it :P

[13:22] <LiMpIcH> revenant, I got ADHD, and when i was smaller it wasn't hard to tell. ^^

[13:22] <revenant> It's a way for people to claim that you're "messed up" in some way, when really you're just on the end of a spectrum of _normal levels_

[13:22] <Vidi> I&#39d never use it as an excuse

[13:22] <justin_> TestDummy: Single 25565?

[13:22] <Thugaim> GIFTCODE

[13:22] <ak> well i dont have AS and i can have panic attacks

[13:22] <Notcoo> Yushatak trust me when I say that I'm not trying to offend

[13:22] <TestDummy> Source is what the outside sees, destination is the port that's listening on the inside server.

[13:22] <Yushatak> Vidi: i don't either, but that doesn't stop me from being so dysfunctional i can't get a job

[13:22] <Notcoo> Yushatak I just find the word funny

[13:22] <LiMpIcH> revenant It's not. do you know what ADHD stands for?

[13:23] <Thugaim> I use Apsergers as an excuse to get a giftcode.

[13:23] <Zerim> Where did Miclee get off to...

[13:23] <Zerim> :P

[13:23] <Vidi> I use AS to explain why I'm like what I'm like

[13:23] <TestDummy> So yes, 25565 would probably suffice.

[13:23] <ak> life alone is depressing so you need to find a way to deal with it

[13:23] <ak> or thats what i feel like

[13:23] <justin_> Ok

[13:23] <TestDummy> For both source and destination.

[13:23] <TestDummy> You understand what it's doing right?

[13:23] <justin_> Kind of?

[13:23] <ak> at least you're seeing a psychologist so thats the first step

[13:25] <justin_> Now what

[13:25] <ak> my "panic attacks" as of late, i dont know what the cause is but i never used to be like this

[13:25] * Jorbazz has joined #minecraft.

[13:25] <LiMpIcH> revenant I'm 17 yrs now, people can't tell that i got ADHD, its actually fades away with age. But i hade really big problems in my early school years.

[13:25] <ak> so i believe with my heart that i can return to my previous self with effort

[13:25] <ak> i guess thats what keeps me going lol

[13:25] <Vidi> panick attacks can be completely random

[13:25] <revenant> I know.

[13:25] <revenant> LiMpIcH: as did I.

[13:25] * MissingNo has joined #minecraft.

[13:25] * MissingNo has quit: Remote host closed the connection

[13:25] <Yushatak> ak: effort helps a lot, but it's not always the only thing needed

[13:25] <Vidi> they're usually a build up of problems

[13:25] <Notcoo> LiMpIcH same with me

[13:25] <justin_> THis sux

[13:25] <Umm> I used to get panic attacks

[13:25] <Vidi> or being just plain paranoid, lol

[13:26] <revenant> I know from experience.

[13:26] <Umm> I still get random bursts of fear

[13:26] <PatD> Hi guys. I bought it earlier but it doesn't say I have it. What could've gone wrong? I received paypal email confirming payment

[13:26] <Yushatak> PatD: takes time, 24 hours before you should worry

[13:26] <Zerim> Okay then, a lot of people are having this problem......

[13:26] <pakman> it's christmas

[13:26] <pakman> that's your problem

[13:26] <Yushatak> yeah that too.

[13:26] <Thugaim> You need to give me a proper giftcode in order for me to help you'

[13:26] <revenant> My point is, there are people who genuinely have hyperactivity disorders, or attention deficit disorders.

[13:26] <fusurugi> lol

[13:26] * VampPadraig has quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer

[13:26] <LiMpIcH> Notcoo Lol, i had great teachers in school that helped me trough it :) ^^

[13:26] <justin_> Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalp

[13:26] <ak> im paranoid about stuff

[13:26] * Zerim looks for Miclee for his epic contacts

[13:26] <ak> there was no stress or paranoia or worry for me

[13:27] <LiMpIcH> revenant that may be true

[13:27] <justin_> TestDummy: Please

[13:27] <TestDummy> justin_: Please what?

[13:27] <revenant> And of course it'll come under control with time, you're maturing.

[13:27] <Yushatak> ak: i am socially at the level of about a middle schooler, and i'm almost 21. <---- this is my problem.

[13:27] <TestDummy> I can't help you through all this nonsense.

[13:27] <justin_> TestDummy: I give u cookies for port forwarding

[13:27] <ak> i wash my hands like 50 times per day

[13:27] <ak> lol

[13:27] <LiMpIcH> revenant and i actually want to make a new test in this age, just to see if the system are fckktup.

[13:27] <TestDummy> I told you already that it wasn't complicated.

[13:27] <justin_> TestDummy: YES IT IS

[13:27] <Zerim> TestDummy, it's not that hard. Just separate the conversation into Who's Talking About Social Disorders and Who Needs Help

[13:27] <TestDummy> Just forward the damn port to whatever computer on your network has the server running.

[13:27] <revenant> LiMpIcH: theres no test...

[13:27] <justin_> IT NO WORK

[13:28] * MissingNo has joined #minecraft.

[13:28] <revenant> Well, they can strap electrodes to your head, yes.

[13:28] <Yushatak> TestDummy: i am simulataneously helping people and discussing.

[13:28] <TestDummy> WRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRY

[13:28] * MissingNo has quit: Remote host closed the connection

[13:28] <revenant> But that was proven to not prove shit.

[13:28] <Yushatak> justin_: put yourself on the "DMZ"

[13:28] <TestDummy> justin_: Ever consider hiring somebody to figure it out?

[13:28] <Yushatak> justin_: and make sure you have a firewall up

[13:28] <TestDummy> Yushatak: Dumb idea.

[13:28] <LiMpIcH> revenant Lol i know nothing about electrodes, but i know i did a test in my early ages ^^

[13:28] <justin_> WHAT

[13:28] <Yushatak> TestDummy: not if you have a non-router-level firewall

[13:28] <justin_> I have LINUX

[13:28] <fusurugi> id like to zap myself out of everyone's trouble now and then. but i wont be coming back then, and thats the catch.

[13:28] <revenant> trust me. I remember all the tests.

[13:28] <Yushatak> justin_: you're using linux and you can't figure out how to port forward?

[13:28] <revenant> I know from experience it's bullshit.

[13:28] <Yushatak> justin_: oh my god.

[13:28] <TestDummy> justin_: UBERHAXXORZ

[13:28] <justin_> ;(

[13:28] * moshee has quit: Remote host closed the connection

[13:29] <TestDummy> My Linux will take me to the stars. WEE!

[13:29] <justin_> I am trying to port forward in a vbox

[13:29] <Yushatak> well i wouldnt worry about it then, just stick urself on the DMZ

[13:29] <justin_> What

[13:29] <xENO_> What distribution?

[13:29] <Yushatak> how is your vbox set up

[13:29] <Thugaim> GIFTCODE PEOPLE.

[13:29] <Yushatak> what sort of networking

[13:29] <justin_> Its WinXP

[13:29] <Snowman> TestDummy, you're an IRCop and all you get is helping people port forwarding :D

[13:29] <LiMpIcH> revenant BTW, can you sa ASPBERGER isn't a disorder as well?

[13:29] <WoodWork> woop woop.

[13:29] * TestDummy make sure it's set up to either be bridged to the computer's NIC, if this is Virtualbox we're talking about.

[13:29] <WoodWork> Anyone got a giftcode?

[13:29] <justin_> Networking: Adapter 1: PCnet-FAST III (NAT)

[13:30] <Yushatak> LiMpIcH: he's not saying that - he's saying that ADHD is overused as an excuse for people without problems... so is AS, really, but some of us really have some serious issues.

[13:30] * djrazr has left #minecraft: No reason specified

[13:30] <TestDummy> SO FAST

[13:30] <xENO_> justin_: NAT is wrong.

[13:30] <Yushatak> justin_: that's your problem - you can't use NAT for that

[13:30] <Thugaim> I'm looking for one. GTFO my internets.

[13:30] <Yushatak> justin_: you need "Bridged"

[13:30] <Zerim> Snowman, you're an IRC OP and you do... lolwat?

[13:30] * Oddtwang_ has quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer

[13:30] <Snowman> And I kick people

[13:30] <Yushatak> justin_: NAT means that your virtual computer is behind a virtual router, and you&#39d have to do TWO port forwards (one which can't be done because it's a virtual router without settings)

[13:30] <LiMpIcH> Yushatak Ty for the explanation ^^ im just a bit tired today and may be alot slower then usual :p

[13:30] <justin_> I will try to change I guess

[13:30] <Thugaim> GIFTCODE

[13:30] <Snowman> And secretly talk to Notch

[13:30] <Yushatak> LiMpIcH: np :D

[13:30] <justin_> Thanks

[13:30] <ak> Yushatak: do you ever worry about a job

[13:31] <Zerim> Well, Snowman, all ops do. that's why they're ops/

[13:31] <justin_> That makes sense b/c I can't connex to router on it

[13:31] <Zerim> :S

[13:31] <Cial> every server i go to is griefed to hell and back in smp

[13:31] <Juggernaut151-Phone> ohai

[13:31] <ak> i think some of my stress is thinking about how i can work like this

[13:31] <Thugaim> CODEGFT

[13:31] <Yushatak> ak: yes, always - i'm clinincally depressed and am reluctantly stuck living with my parents still

[13:31] <Snowman> Not all ops secretly talk to Notch

[13:31] <LiMpIcH> Btw why is everonye yelling Giftcard ? >_>

[13:31] <justin_> What do I attach it to?

[13:31] <Yushatak> them*

[13:31] <Thugaim> I'm yelling giftcode cause I need one.

[13:31] * |_ocke has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[13:31] <Zerim> Snowman, well, I guess... because not all ops know who Kappische is. *cough cough*

[13:31] <Yushatak> ak: yes, it's strangers, particularly women (for obvious reasons, that's always worse for a male) that cause problems.

[13:31] <ak> are you sure its not that you think people dont like you, but in reality they actually do like you

[13:31] <LiMpIcH> Thugaim Why not just buy..?

[13:31] <TestDummy> justin_: You attach the bridged adapter to whichever interface is the one connected to your network.

[13:31] <Snowman> Kappische is Kappische

[13:32] <Thugaim> Don't has momney, and if I did, mom wouldn't let me

[13:32] * Aquaskys has joined #minecraft.

[13:32] <ak> i actually have pretty similar worries to you

[13:32] <Yushatak> ak: it's not that they hate me, it's that i don't come across as a person you&#39d want to hire because my demeanor comes off oddly because i'm not comfortable talking to them in that sort of environment

[13:32] * The_GoD has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[13:32] <ak> well what does your psychologist think is the solution for your issues

[13:32] <HotSoup> Question. Why is it that Creepers do not die in the sunlight? It's quite a pain to go outside during the day and get pwned by Creepers everywhere.

[13:32] <ak> or like the steps you need to take

[13:32] <Zerim> Not talking about you, btw, Snowman

[13:51] <Shadow386> the map got griefed by a team of faggots, so I had to revert to our original

[13:51] <Zerim> omg, temp ban him or something

[13:51] <macintoshhelper> xales: it was alpha

[13:51] <Juggernaut151-Phone> Smarag: you trollin'?

[13:51] * Notcoo throws a Diamond Pickaxe at xales face

[13:51] * xales has an obsidian shield

[13:51] <Quatroking> Shadow386 I don't really care

[13:51] <Smarag> Juggernaut151-Phone Of course not. It's serious buisness.

[13:52] <Quatroking> ever since you installed that custom server crap its been laggy anyways

[13:52] <Shadow386> alright was just letting you know your base got fucked up

[13:52] * xales is superior, and leaves the arena

[13:52] <macintoshhelper> xales: I have a bedrock shield and diamond pick ^_^

[13:52] <Quatroking> pretty sure vanilla doesn't have annoying usergroups and whatnot

[13:52] <xales> the only way to win is not to fight :)

[13:53] <Shadow386> Well the thing about that is we didnt use cuboid protection with some places, cause they arent updated.

[13:53] <Quatroking> xales, thats the worst logic ever

[13:53] <Shadow386> Thats why things got griefed

[13:53] <xales> Quatroking: in this case, it applies :(

[13:53] <Notcoo> xales thats what you say when you know you don't have a snowflakes chance in hell

[13:53] <Ryl> Good logic when going against a troll though.

[13:53] <Smarag> Juggernaut151-Phone you should get them fixed up I think.

[13:53] <Shadow386> and idiots think griefing is funny, so they team up with the faggotry.

[13:53] * MissingNo has quit: Remote host closed the connection

[13:54] <Shadow386> Im not a tard

[13:54] <Smarag> Notcoo No. A strange game this is. The only way to win is not to play.

[14:42] <Sqozthulu> Just not expansions and stuff.

[14:42] <GLaDOSDan> Ah

[14:43] <GLaDOSDan> Little silly that I'm paying _more_ but getting _less_

[14:43] * AustinDGibbs has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[14:43] <Sqozthulu> Nah, it's cause we got in early.

[14:43] <xales> Please wait 24 hours after purchasing the game for your account to be activated and marked as premium. If your account is still not upgraded by then, send an e-mail to payment@mojang.com with your transaction ID and username.

[14:43] * Darlos9D has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[14:43] <Sqozthulu> Consider it an earlybird bonus.

[14:44] <xolotl> It's a Christmas miracle!

[14:44] <Sqozthulu> It's a little slow, apparently.

[14:44] <Sqozthulu> I got my copy a few months back.

[14:44] <GLaDOSDan> Everything relating to minecraft.net's servers seems to be "slow"

[14:45] <Virus|Nbs> GLaDOSDan

[14:46] <Virus|Nbs> Maybe some issues with paypal and since they didn't get activated automatically, now i believe it will be done manually

[14:46] <Shrub> nice coal

[14:46] * Kaito has joined #minecraft.

[14:46] <xales> GLaDOSDan: no, but they are having issues with automatic processing

[14:46] <Virus|Nbs> which explains all the delay

[15:28] <LordShagrax> hmm, why does minecraft server kill connection on an winxp computer, when a player joins the server?

[15:28] <cryzed> LordShagrax, any output in the console?

[15:28] <bildramer> I wonder what the fuck product designers do for a living

[15:28] <bildramer> because they can't get paid for this shit

[15:28] <cryzed> LordShagrax, it's kind of hard to help you out elsewise

[15:29] * xalesbot has left #minecraft: No reason specified

[15:29] <bildramer> are they trying to make packages hard as shit to open?

[15:29] <cryzed> bildramer, haha :D

[15:29] <LordShagrax> it completely kills connection to network, i use to access the comp via RDP

[15:29] <macintoshhelper> Did someone just send me a PM?

[15:29] <macintoshhelper> nvm sorry

[15:29] <bildramer> batteries

[15:29] <dazappa> wouldn't want an expensive product easy to open, could be stolen in stores

[15:30] <bildramer> um

[15:30] <bildramer> they still make profit selling it

[15:30] <cryzed> dazappa, that's not really valid reasoning

[15:30] * ferret__ has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[15:30] <xENO_> Right, but if it's shipped from, say, Amazon, you want to be easy to open.

[15:30] <TPC> yeah but if you order it online and have to open it with a saw when it arrives in the mail, something is wrong

[15:30] * dodson has quit: Quit: Quit

[15:30] <dazappa> valid enough for my tastes

[15:30] <bildramer> problem #2: food products having extremely stupid opening mechanisms

[15:47] <RocketSnail> @xales thanks for your interest.

[15:47] <illmatix> when i start minecraft server i get a warnning about not enough ram. i take it that 300mb of free ram isn't enough?

[15:47] <Bilkokuya> need christmas help fast: I've made a card for my mum with a bunch of creeper&#39d animals (as in giraffes in the style of creepers etc.) and need some kind of catchline for the card

[15:47] <cryzed> illmatix, yes.

[15:47] <Bilkokuya> if anybody has a decent idea, post it and it goes on.

[15:47] <illmatix> cryzed: would it be enough for only 2 players?

[15:47] <cryzed> illmatix, since depending on your player count the server allocates additional RAM

[15:47] <xales> illmatix: you need 1gb for it to not bitch at you

[15:47] * Abrax has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[15:47] * Youhan has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[15:48] <Bilkokuya> 300mb will normally support the majority of the server load for a long time

[15:48] <Bilkokuya> it will just freak out when a new player joins or loads chunks

[16:11] * Nats^ has joined #minecraft.

[16:11] <bildramer> I hate that angosticism scale bullshit

[16:11] <Bored> what do you mean bildramer?

[16:11] * Interman has quit: Quit: Forlater kanalen

[16:11] <bildramer> that there are agnostic theists, agnostic atheists, gnostic theists and agnostic atheists

[16:12] <bildramer> first of all, if you're gnostic you've gone full retard

[16:12] <Notcoo> erm wtf?

[16:12] * Kizzi has quit: Quit: Leaving.

[16:12] <luigiman> What's the difference between the second and last?

[16:12] <Notcoo> you are either Agnostic Athiest or Thiest

[16:12] <Notcoo> Agnostic Athiest doesn't exist

[16:12] <bildramer> second, if you're agnostic you don't believe in a god, so atheist

[16:12] <Notcoo> nor does an Agnostic thiest

[16:12] <bildramer> actually

[16:12] <bildramer> you believe you can't know

[16:12] <bildramer> which is the same, basically

[16:13] <Zeis> bildramer, well, agnostic == don't believe in god but there could be a possibility of a higher entitiy, you just can't proove it as of right now

[16:13] <Bored> actually the term agnostic is a claim to not know

[16:13] * Nats has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[16:13] * jacobdb has quit: Quit: Flip the switch

[16:13] <Bored> the term atheiest is a claim to not beleive

[16:13] <Zeis> Atheist == there is no god/higher entity

[16:13] <luigiman> You believe that you do not believie .

[16:13] <bildramer> so I would do

[16:13] <Bored> a gnostic athiest claims to no there is no god

[16:13] <bildramer> agnostic atheist - agnostic - gnostic theist

[16:13] * richardus has joined #minecraft.

[16:13] * Thaylis has joined #minecraft.

[16:13] <Notcoo> Athiest is BELIEVING that god doesn't exist

[16:13] <bildramer> no

[16:13] <Notcoo> Athiest is the LACK OF belief of anything

[16:13] <Notcoo> isn't*

[16:13] <Notcoo> sorry

[16:13] * JamesK89 has quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer

[16:13] <Bored> no it's actually a lack of beleif in god

[16:14] <bildramer> ...yes

[16:14] <Bored> there are multiple atheist releigions

[16:14] * PhonicUK has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[16:14] <bildramer> no

[16:14] <basicxman> For every channel, a religion war.

[16:14] <Thaylis> No lol

[16:14] <bildramer> oh.

[16:14] <bildramer> nevermind

[16:14] <bildramer> yes, true

[16:14] <Zeis> Bored, that makes the whole concept of atheism obsolete

[16:14] * TheSentinel has joined #minecraft.

[16:14] <bildramer> Zeis, no u

[16:14] <Bored> no it doesn't

[16:14] <Zeis> bildramer, <3

[16:14] <bildramer> see buddhism and the like

[16:14] * root has joined #minecraft.

[16:14] * Thaylis has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[16:14] <Zeis> of course it does

[16:14] <Zeis> hm

[16:14] <bildramer> I'm just saying, wait a minute

[16:14] <Zeis> but Buddah is kind of a higher entity

[16:14] <Bored> Atheist is simply a term that encompases those who do not beleive in a God

[16:15] * root has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[16:15] <Zeis> and rebirth is kind of an afterworld

[16:15] * TriGuN has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[16:15] <Zeis> atheism == pure science

[16:15] <Jat> not rly

[16:15] <Bored> no it does not

[16:15] <Zeis> ...

[16:15] <Bored> Theism is the beleif in a dietey

[16:15] <Zeis> I may be wrong

[16:15] <Zeis> I admit that

[16:15] <Zeis> but for me, atheism = there is no god

[16:15] <Jat> no != science

[16:15] <Jat> i mean

[16:15] <Bored> yes, but thats ALL it means

[16:15] <Jat> no god != science

[16:16] <bildramer> brb

[16:16] <Zeis> yeah, but atheism is no religion therefor

[16:16] <bildramer> ...

[16:16] <Bored> releigion does not require a diety

[16:16] <bildramer> there are religions without gods

[16:16] <Jat> atheism is basically a religion

[16:16] <bildramer> noob

[16:16] <bildramer> Jat, no

[16:16] <bildramer> atheism can be one

[16:16] <Zeis> it doesn't have to be a god in the sense of christianity

[16:16] <Jat> atheism = belief that there is no god without proof that there is no god

[16:17] <Jat> in other words

[16:17] <Jat> faith in the nonexistence of any gods

[16:17] <Zeis> but I don't want to be religious!

[16:17] <Zeis> ARGH!

[16:17] <Jat> be agnostic like the cool kids

[16:17] <Zeis> I kinda am, I guess

[16:18] <Zeis> things and stuff

[16:18] <Zeis> uhm

[16:18] <Zeis> afk.

[16:18] <bildramer> you can't be certain about the existence of a deity

[16:18] <bildramer> so any intelligent being would be agnostic

[16:18] <Bored> Agnostic is not mututally esclusive with either theism or atheism

[16:18] <Zeis> <bildramer> you can't be certain about the existence of a deity <-- exactly

[16:18] <Bored> as is is simply a claim to not know

[16:18] <bildramer> not quite a claim

[16:18] <Jat> agnostic is a very vague and broad term also

[16:18] <bildramer> since it is absolutely true

[16:19] * revenant has joined #minecraft.

[16:19] * Andret has joined #minecraft.

[16:19] <Bored> Personally I would be an agnostic theist

[16:19] <Jat> but the common accepted meaning of agnostic is just "i dont know, maybe"

[16:19] <bildramer> that would be true agnostic

[16:19] <Bored> I beleive in God, but hell if I know and I don't really care

[16:19] * Esge has quit: Quit: You can tell the size of a man by the size of the thing that makes him mad.

[16:20] <Bored> There's a large gap between beleif and knowledge

[16:20] <bildramer> I would be an agnostic-but-this-shit-is-so-retarded-I-could-just-round-it-up-to-100%-gnostic atheist

[16:20] <Jat> which shit

[16:20] <Jat> theres a lot of shit :|

[16:20] <bildramer> we can't technically know

[16:20] * PhonicUK has joined #minecraft.

[16:21] * SanctuaryRemix has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[16:21] <Jat> unless youre referring to christianity or something specifically

[16:21] <bildramer> linux sucks lol

[16:21] <Bored> anyways I'm tired, ttyl guys, though aint dcing cause I'm dling

[16:21] <bildramer> it wouldn't suck if more people used it

[16:21] * DrRabotoo has joined #minecraft.

[16:22] <Bored> also you guys suck

[16:22] * bildramer is pirating stuff even right now

[16:22] <Bored> l2linux

[16:22] <Silentspy> how can linux suck?

[16:22] * bildramer needs to free up even more disk space

[16:22] <Silentspy> its awesome!

[16:22] <bildramer> let's not discuss that

[16:22] <Silentspy> but not for gaming :)

[16:22] <bildramer> personal opinion etc.

[16:22] <Jat> well first you have to configure it to suck properly

[16:22] <bildramer> nah

[16:22] <bildramer> real men can properly configure

[16:22] * DrRabotoo has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[16:22] <bildramer> that's not the problem

[16:22] <Scarecrow> Well, to cut it down into easy terms, bildramer only uses popular operating systems like plan 9 or haiku

[16:22] <bildramer> the problem is most of ANYTHING is released for windows

[16:23] <Scarecrow> something unfashionable like linux is far below him

[16:23] <bildramer> and Wine is shitty

[16:23] <dazappa> ha

[16:23] <Bored> Linux is great

[16:23] <bildramer> Scarecrow, stfu

[16:23] <Bored> not for everyone

[16:23] <whatapath> linux has its purpose

[16:23] <Bored> has it uses

[16:23] <Scarecrow> bildramer, it was a joke. Haiku has a total usercount for about 12.

[16:23] <Bored> I dual boot

[16:23] <Scarecrow> of*

[16:23] <Jat> i installed freebsd on a partition on this computer but eventually realized it was not particularly useful

[16:23] <bildramer> lol

[16:23] <Jat> i cant really use it as a serious os

[16:23] <bildramer> I had a VM

[16:23] <bildramer> then wondered

[16:23] <xales> http://xkcd.com/806/

[16:23] <bildramer> "why the fuck do I have a vm"

[16:23] <bildramer> then removed it

[16:23] <Bored> did have a mac too but it was my works and that job is done now

[16:24] <Scarecrow> I'm playing TF2 faultlessly on DirectX 9 right now via wine, so it can't be *terrible*

[16:24] <Scarecrow> most of the time it's a case of config

[16:24] <xales> Jat: Linux/BSDs/Unixes are really for advanced users who know how to use them and have a reason to, sadly, most people dont get it because its "different" :(

[16:24] * LadyCygna has quit: Quit: Saliendo

[16:24] <Bored> ya, but Wine can be a bitch to config

[16:25] * Tonux has quit: Quit: Bye

[16:25] <Scarecrow> Well, if you can't config wine how the hell did you manage to install linux

[16:25] <Scarecrow> unless it was ubuntu

[16:25] <bildramer> ...

[16:25] <xales> Scarecrow: most of em have pretty GUIs for install now

[16:25] <bildramer> um

[16:25] <bildramer> what

[16:25] <Bored> I used the word CAN

[16:25] <Bored> some games just fucking hate it

[16:25] <bildramer> no, utorrent, I don't want to install every single build update

[16:25] * xales suggests no longer talking about either >.>

[16:26] <bildramer> let's talk about politics

[16:26] <Bored> most games work real easy with wine

[16:26] <xales> bildramer: and lets talk about them in ALL CAPS

[16:26] <bildramer> I'm sadly becoming more and more conservative

[16:26] <xales> :/

[16:26] * Blackthorne is now known as RedNoseRudolphHess.

[16:26] <Bored> I'm all for the socialism

[16:26] <Scarecrow> Games with the most difficult config setups usually have a wine appdb page with instructions from the maintainer

[16:26] <Bored> except communism

[16:26] <bildramer> ...let's rather not talk about it

[16:26] <Bored> poorly design system right there

[16:26] <bildramer> what about Minecraft?

[16:27] <Visiiri> What's Minecraft?

[16:27] <Bored> what's that?

[16:27] <bildramer> I heard about it in reddit

[17:38] <bildramer> good night

[17:38] <MadMockers> (but not a mac)

[17:38] <Phopojijo> MadMockers -- If you were cool you&#39d have a MECHANICAL keyboard :p

[17:39] <Phopojijo> That you shelved a backlit keyboard to use :p

[17:39] <MadMockers> Most keyboards are mechanical

[17:39] * Cial has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[17:39] <Phopojijo> No

[17:39] <klepto> if you were cool you&#39d have an ICE keyboard

[17:39] <MadMockers> Yes... yes they are. When you press down on the key, that is mechanical movement

[17:39] <Phopojijo> Yes, almost every keyboard works on mechanical principles

[17:40] <Notcoo> xales not making anyone do it XD

[17:40] <MadMockers> And most laptop keys have mechanical springs under them

[17:40] <Phopojijo> But almost no keyboards are mechanical keyboards :p

[17:40] <xales> Notcoo: if you want it done, thats what you gotta do

[17:40] <bildramer> ....

[17:40] * Piehti has quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client

[17:40] <Phopojijo> Diaphragm versus individual switch

[17:40] <Notcoo> Its rubber which springs back up on laptops

[17:40] * xales doesnt think we should argue about something irrelevant

[17:40] <bildramer> why would that not be mechanical?

[17:40] <klepto> more like teleCOOLnesis

[17:41] * bildramer wonders how a static keyboard would work

[17:41] <Notcoo> I worded it wrong

[17:41] <Phopojijo> MadMockers -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard :p The keyboard companies.

[17:41] <bildramer> piezo crystals

[17:41] <bildramer> mechanical-switch != mechanical

[17:41] <MadMockers> bildramer: Those lazar keyboards are static

[17:41] <VioletPenguin> static keyboards are pretty

[17:41] <Notcoo> bildramer static keyboard = touchscreen

[17:41] <bildramer> not quite, last time I checked lasers aren't static

[17:42] <MadMockers> Well, assuming that photons have no mass, there is no movement of mass

[17:42] <bildramer> durr

[17:42] <MadMockers> i.e, static

[17:42] <VioletPenguin> but... assuming they do have mass...

[17:43] <MadMockers> Electrons have mass.. does this mean that every electronical circuit is now mechanical?

[17:43] <xales> Notcoo: I did it anyway :P

[17:43] <bildramer> yeah right

[17:43] <VioletPenguin> yes

[17:43] <bildramer> whatever.

[17:43] <bildramer> but just touching the keys, lol

[17:43] <Kadey> mechanical doesn't really have a completely foolproof definition

[17:45] <bildramer> don't abuse that bot

[17:45] <Kadey> well Notcoo - the first one is the relevent one to this - and its a circular definition

[17:45] <Phopojijo> Anyway, Minecraft seems to have some -- really weird behaviour when it comes to letting you get your items back post-death.

[17:45] <MadMockers> theres ur pics everyone

[17:46] <bildramer> mechanical: moving parts where "parts" are solids

[17:46] <bildramer> um, or liquids

[17:46] <Phopojijo> One time I died in the middle of nowhere -- decided to say screw it and work on remaking them. Half, only half, of my items appeared at my house.

[17:48] <Notcoo> bildramer can xales add an smp automation reply to his bot?

[17:48] <Notcoo> xalesbot hush!

[17:48] <xales> Notcoo: I wouldnt do it even if he asked me to

[17:48] <DINOSAURS> No one?

[17:48] <Phopojijo> Earlier today I had some (not all) of my items come back... twice... so I had 2 compasses but no watches, no torches :p

[17:49] <xales> im lazy, and there isnt a need for it

[17:49] <bildramer> actually, we should put everything from the topic to the bot

[17:49] <xales> DINOSAURS: look on minecraftforum.net

[17:49] <xales> or is it forums? I cant remember

[17:49] <bildramer> servers.minecraftforum.net too

[17:49] <xales> bildramer: if you want it to be an official bot I can add you/other ops to use list so you can kill it off

[17:54] <noes> okay

[17:54] <noes> i'll try

[17:54] <Notcoo> You also have to delete a file I believe

[17:54] <Notcoo> or modify 1

[17:54] * pheleas_frog has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[17:54] <GoMySQL> Nope, not at all.

[17:55] <Notcoo> so it doesn't autoupdate

[17:55] <GoMySQL> Just make sure you kill all instances of javaw.exe first

[17:55] <GoMySQL> No modification needs to be made - just replace the .jar.

[17:55] <Risugami> just don't touch version file

[17:55] <Keiya> ... what the hell... Apparently Microsoft decided to not support playing DVDs with Kinect controls...

[17:56] <Banane3> m$ supports java

[18:15] <Phopojijo> Notcoo -- And the laser optics course I took in my physics degree that talked about the transatlantic fibre system was like 2 years ago

[18:15] <xales> they will make the internet faster yes, but then it is also up to ISPs to change THEIR routing. all this costs money

[18:17] <Phopojijo> Notcoo -- Yeah it's possible... but it involves getting servers very close to you, which means telco deals. OnLive would basically be Comcast for videogames

[18:21] <Azathoth> i can have*

[18:21] <Notcoo> Phopojijo how is another option problematic?

[18:21] <Phopojijo> Notcoo -- Pushing games toward the broadcast model that every other medium (podcasting vs. radio/TV, etc) is trying to get away from

[18:21] <Notcoo> Phopojijo if people don't like it .... it will fall flat on its face

[18:21] <Notcoo> simple

[18:21] <Phopojijo> Notcoo -- Given enough marketshare... games like Minecraft would need to ask permission to be made.

[18:30] <Trandescent> All endgame hats, page 3.

[18:31] <Trandescent> Im done trading now.

[18:31] <Notcoo> Azathoth the same damn reason why people spend 500000$$$ on useless crap irl

[18:31] <Trandescent> All vintage, all the best hats for each class.

[18:31] <Notcoo> Azathoth aka... golden taps

[18:31] <Trandescent> Notcoo Well theres a difference between physical items and pixels.

[18:31] <Notcoo> Trandescent its relative

[18:32] <Emberleaf> That's a philosophical discussion...and there really isn't an answer either way, I believe.

[18:32] <Notcoo> each person perceives a different value on different things

[18:32] <Azathoth> right

[18:32] <Trandescent> Notcoo Well think of it this way. TF2 could shut down. Any time. And you lose everything you paid for. Unless 2012 is real, or something else happens, you most likely wont lose them

[18:32] <Trandescent> But yeah

[18:32] <Trandescent> Different people, different values.

[18:33] <Emberleaf> Well....you pay for car insurance, and where does all that money go if you never have an accident?

[18:33] <Trandescent> Well, I mean, thats COMPLETELY different.

[18:33] <Notcoo> Trandescent well I was just trying to explain the question " Why the phuck are people paying hundreds of dollars for stupid phucking hats?"

[18:33] * rschultea has joined #minecraft.

[18:33] <Azathoth> it goes to pay for someone else's accident

[18:33] <Azathoth> insurance is communism! :P

[18:33] <Trandescent> :P

[18:33] <Trandescent> Basically, notcoo

[18:33] <Trandescent> Its called addiction.

[18:33] <Emberleaf> You're paying for a service, honestly....I view paying for virtual items as the same thing.

[18:33] <Trandescent> People become merchants

[18:33] <Trandescent> But now wait.

[18:33] <Trandescent> Heres what the merchants do.

[18:34] <Notcoo> Trandescent my answer was " the same reason people spend a boat load of cash on useless crap in IRL "

[18:34] <Trandescent> They buy low and resell high.

[18:34] <Azathoth> i mean i waste money just as much as the next guy. i just don't really see a point in buying hats i'm not even going to use

[18:34] <Trandescent> :\

[18:34] <Emberleaf> Then you don't buy them....problem solved?

[18:34] <Trandescent> I have my favorite vintage hat for each class

[20:02] <clarjon1> MadMockers: what update?

[20:02] * ajvpot_ has joined #minecraft.

[20:03] <MadMockers> nvm.. just reading JabJabJab's comments, thought there may have been an update

[20:03] * rcfreak0 has joined #minecraft.

[20:03] * Avis has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[20:04] * Dreeeder has quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.13/20101203075014]

[20:04] <MadMockers> So on a server where you are banned when you die, would you think there would be a need for griefer protection?

[20:05] <MadMockers> Cause to ban someone.. you just kill them

[20:05] * DevilDay has joined #minecraft.

[20:05] * ash has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[20:05] <MadMockers> And since no one would trust anyone, everyone would build far away from spawn

[20:06] * Amaranth has joined #minecraft.

[20:06] <klepto> couldn't a griefer just join and get to slaughtering

[20:06] <S_Trunks> Hmm. I'm not familiar with these dynamic scenarios

[20:07] <MadMockers> Yes

[20:07] <MadMockers> But chances are, the griefer won't have good eq.

[20:07] * sabrebutt has quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client

[20:07] <klepto> good point

[20:07] <S_Trunks> Is it an IP ban or a username ban?

[20:07] <MadMockers> I have my you die your banned mod working, just wondering if I need griefer protection

[20:07] <MadMockers> Username

[20:08] <MadMockers> I don't particularly care if a griefer has 2 or 3 usernames

[20:08] <MadMockers> chances are someone will kill them before they do too much damage

[20:08] * Strelkovaya has joined #minecraft.

[20:09] <S_Trunks> Yeah. I&#39d say you rules good as is

[20:09] * Avis has joined #minecraft.

[20:10] * esper_nzwpaz has left #minecraft: No reason specified

[20:10] * Dvonio has left #minecraft: No reason specified

[20:10] <MadMockers> k cool

[20:10] <MadMockers> ima put up the servers today some time

[20:10] <S_Trunks> seems a bit brutal :D

[20:10] <MadMockers> There will be 4 servers staggered weekly

[20:11] <MadMockers> and each one will restart every 28 days

[20:11] <S_Trunks> damn. That's gonna rope some people in to doing nothing but!

[20:11] <MadMockers> such that when you die, you move onto the newest server

[20:11] * ash has joined #minecraft.

[20:11] <S_Trunks> 4 chances to play

[20:11] * Darlos9D has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[20:12] <MadMockers> I want to mod the server such that it forces you to play on the newest server when you get die on one

[20:12] * NishaKitten has joined #minecraft.

[20:12] <MadMockers> so its the same IP:port, but the server runs multiple worlds

[20:12] <S_Trunks> I wouldn't have a clue as to how to do that

[20:12] * NishaKitty has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[20:12] <xales> I cant imagine there is an easy way to do that; might as well just use a fully custom server

[20:12] * Sliker has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[20:12] * Neal has joined #minecraft.

[20:12] <MadMockers> I could do it, just a lot of work, and I don't think would be worth doing it everytime notch updates

[20:12] <xales> you would probably have to

[20:12] <Neal> hi

[20:13] <MadMockers> xales: All I would need to do is put a world field in the entity class

[20:13] <S_Trunks> *cha-ching*

[20:13] <xales> hello Neal

[20:13] <MadMockers> And every time it references a world, it has to provide that field as well

[20:13] <xales> MadMockers: I havent touched the server code, probably wont

[20:13] <MadMockers> xales: Ah kk... I have been working with it for quite a while

[20:13] <Neal> helo xales

[20:14] <xales> macintoshhelper: please dont advertise servers here

[20:14] <macintoshhelper> I have nowere else to

[20:14] <MadMockers> If you have registered a channel with chanserv, if no one else is in it, and someone recreates it, does chanserv not OP them?

[20:14] <jayxdbx> sup

[20:14] <GreyVulpine> macintoshhelper - #smp

[20:14] <xales> /join #smp

[20:14] <Neal> http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/8317/fuuuuuut.png <------ what do i do? :<

[20:14] <macintoshhelper> No one is ever on smp

[20:14] <Neal> open the pic

[20:14] <xales> macintoshhelper: minecraft forum then

[20:15] <xales> MadMockers: identify as founder

[20:15] <xales> Neal: use paypal

[20:15] <jayxdbx> mac the server im on right now has about 7 people on it at all times.

[20:15] <S_Trunks> damn xales

[20:15] <MadMockers> xales: Yea.. but if some else recreates because no one is in it at that time, does it make the first person in OP if they aren't the founder or on the AOP list?

[20:15] <Neal> xales I don't have payapl

[20:15] <S_Trunks> helpin out!

[20:15] <xales> Neal: you dont need one, you just enter your card number

[20:15] <jayxdbx> at least for the last few days when ever i log on

[20:16] <xales> MadMockers: oh, no. you will be deopped

[20:16] <Neal> xales ok ill try that

[20:16] * bellows has joined #minecraft.

[20:16] * bellows has left #minecraft: No reason specified

[20:16] <xales> I thought you meant reclaiming an old, registerd channel via chanserv

[20:16] <MadMockers> xales: But I have registered it w/ chanserv..

[20:16] <S_Trunks> I wish there was something to be done of all these idlers

[20:16] <xales> MadMockers: /msg ChanServ OP #channel MadMockers

[20:17] <xales> oh

[20:17] <xales> I see

[20:17] <xales> no, it _will_ op them

[20:17] <xales> to promptly be deopped

[20:17] <xales> by chanserv

[20:17] <MadMockers> xales: Ah k

[20:17] * jansukei has joined #minecraft.

[20:17] <S_Trunks> nobody's in the parishilton room

[20:18] <MadMockers> xales: Could you not get a command in w/ a bot before that real quick?

[20:18] <xales> S_Trunks: did you expect someone to be?

[20:18] <S_Trunks> so, you can register that one if ya&#39d like :D

[20:18] <xales> MadMockers: op in channel != chanserv access

[20:18] * srrwb has quit: Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.13/20101203075014]

[20:18] <xales> and it will unset any modes I believe

[20:18] <S_Trunks> Usually Herpes is the Op and genital warts has +v! Oh!

[20:18] <xales> that a bot would set

[20:18] <MadMockers> Yea, but they could OP another user who joins very quickly after them, and they will remain OP until someone registered on the ChanServ can get rid of them

[20:19] * Adamv77 has joined #minecraft.

[20:19] <xales> MadMockers: nope

[20:19] <MadMockers> k

[20:19] <xales> that would take too long

[20:19] <MadMockers> If it's a bot, it might have a chance of working xD

[20:20] <S_Trunks> You&#39d think someone would have taken advantage of that already if it were to work

[20:20] * jayxdbx has quit: Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client

[20:20] <MadMockers> S_Trunks: Only works on empty rooms

[20:20] * S_Trunks 's head explodes

[20:20] <MadMockers> S_Trunks: assuming it works

[20:20] <S_Trunks> but why!?

[20:20] <Neal> xales when I try to use the paypal one, it says someone is trying to imersonate the site! D:

[20:20] <MadMockers> Because the channel has to not exist before you can create it to have a brief moment of OPness

[20:21] <JabJabJab> cool video

[20:21] <Neal> spam!

[20:21] <Neal> tgrrr

[20:21] <xales> Neal: what specifically does it say?

[20:21] <xales> Pastebin: http://pastebin.com

[20:21] <S_Trunks> I think you have ops if no one is currently occupying it and it is not registered with chanserv

[20:21] <xales> S_Trunks: question is though, if it is registered

[20:21] <MadMockers> If it is registered w/ chanserv, then it takes a brief moment for chanserv to de-op you

[20:21] <xales> MadMockers: its the same way you can't ride the split any more

[20:21] <xales> its not an issue

[20:22] <Neal> xales ill make a screenshot

[20:22] <S_Trunks> If it is registered, you will get ops for like, 2 seconds then chanserv will deop you

[20:22] <S_Trunks> OoOo NetSplits... I forgot about those

[20:22] <xales> S_Trunks: actually, it is less than that. It just takes time for the deop to propogate to your client

[20:22] <MadMockers> In that time, with a bot, you could quickly join 2 users, have the first one OP the second, and the second would theoretically remain OP if you could do all that fast enough

[20:22] <S_Trunks> those are exciting. Just like the apocolypse

[20:22] <xales> MadMockers: no, chanserv would deop if ops were obtained like that

[20:22] <S_Trunks> xales: zing!

[20:22] <xales> most likely

[20:22] <MadMockers> AH k

[20:22] <xales> chanserv isnt retarded

[20:22] <xales> :)

[20:23] <xales> its purpose was to stop takeovers

[20:23] <S_Trunks> but...but....but why!?

[20:23] <xales> clone1018: write one then

[20:23] <S_Trunks> Why would you want a bot that went around claiming abandonned channels?

[20:23] <MadMockers> If I am bored I might write a bot to try it on a test channel

[20:23] <clone1018> D:

[20:23] <xales> lol MadMockers

[20:23] <S_Trunks> clone1018: Did you decide on a name for your site?

[20:23] <MadMockers> S_Trunks: It might not be abandoned, it might just be momentarily empty for some reason or another

[20:43] <klepto> otherwise I just use foobar2000's ripping feature

[20:43] <xales> Omega_Guardian: itunes?

[20:44] <Omega_Guardian> I'll try foobars thing since I got it already, only issue I had is it doesn't seem to have any obvious way of adding a music database to it

[20:52] * Monkee has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[20:52] <Neal> and ten go from there?

[20:52] <xales> however

[20:53] <xales> you need to use "Send money"

[20:53] <Neal> ...

[20:53] <S_Trunks> Man, neal, you're really having a tough time, huh?

[20:53] <xales> and send it to another paypal acccount

[20:53] <xales> then use that account

[20:53] <Neal> S_Trunks yes :(

[20:53] <xales> however, you must add a card to that account as well

[20:53] <xales> it will not _use_ the card though

[20:53] <xales> so an empty gift card would work well

[21:20] <Tsathoggua_Box> guys

[21:20] <Tsathoggua_Box> does having acrobatics as a major skill in morrowind really screw up the game that bad?

[21:20] <xales> yes

[21:20] <Tsathoggua_Box> I mean, that's at most, six levels.

[21:20] <xales> the more you level

[21:20] <xales> the harder enemies get

[21:20] <xales> acrobatics isnt useful in combat

[21:20] <xales> much

[21:20] <klepto> no, not in morrowind

[21:20] <xales> oh

[21:21] <xales> never mind me then

[21:21] <Tsathoggua_Box> the thing I'm thinking though, is

[21:21] <klepto> but yeah it does screw up your leveling

[21:21] <Tsathoggua_Box> That if I'm acro-levelled

[21:21] <Tsathoggua_Box> I'll get thrown into things outside my combat range too easily

[21:21] <Tsathoggua_Box> Upside: I can get there really quickly!

[21:21] <Tsathoggua_Box> The other downside is that I also have athletics majorskilled.

[21:21] <klepto> it just makes it harder to control your leveling

[21:22] <Tsathoggua_Box> Although, I won't actually have the game be really hard/really unfun because of it, right?

[21:22] <klepto> because those two skills are some of the few that you constantly use

[21:22] <klepto> no, not really

[21:22] <klepto> it might be harder

[21:22] <Tsathoggua_Box> That's fun though.

[21:22] <klepto> but it's not broken like the oblivion dynamic leveling

[21:22] <Tsathoggua_Box> Also, there's a difficulty slider. I turned it up.

[22:37] <Arctic> Well, what do you want them to do?

[22:37] <chuckles> it totally takes away everything special about being a jedi as far as i'm concerned

[23:43] * Populus has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[23:43] <xales> Cial: we don't support them here however

[23:43] <Terrance> Things that don't abuse the legal issues but are still user enhancements

[23:43] <clone1018> Okay. Control panel design done :D

[23:43] <Hallicarnassuss> 'One of the first major things to add during beta is the modding support. We need to sort that out first'

[23:43] <clone1018> Time to CSSify it

[23:43] <Hallicarnassuss> -Notch

[23:43] <Cial> which is bull shit but thats for a later rant xales

[23:43] <xales> Terrance: if htey modify the source code you stll can't talk about it here

[23:43] * ash has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[23:43] <xales> Hallicarnassuss: that is via an API. not editing the source code

[23:43] <xales> he said that in his blog

[23:43] <Hallicarnassuss> 'There's a lot of potential in mods. Some people out there are extremely clever!'

[23:43] <Hallicarnassuss> His next post...

[23:44] * Guest756649748 has joined #minecraft.

[23:44] <Hallicarnassuss> Oh I'm not bothering..

[23:44] <xales> indeed. modding the game through a way its meant to != modifying the surce code

[23:44] <teah1> yeah, thru the api

[23:44] * Moop has joined #minecraft.

[23:44] <Moop> so

[23:44] <Moop> christmas update: will it happen?

[23:44] <xales> Cial: ?

[23:44] <Hallicarnassuss> Nya.

[23:45] <Arctic> well talking about not modding the game is another way of talking about modding the game without really talking about it

[23:45] <Arctic> such as

[23:45] <Terrance> Ok I made a word mod in minecraft using dirt

[23:45] * Mbloker has joined #minecraft.

[23:45] <Terrance> All it says is mod

[23:45] <Terrance> In dirt

[23:45] <Cial> xales, just a quirk i have about the taboo topics of this channel

[23:45] * MrCakes has joined #minecraft.

[23:45] * Sketchfile has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[23:45] <Arctic> I would never mod the game by downloading insert program here to do insert action here.

[23:45] <xales> Cial: take it up with an op

[23:45] * [Fuffy]CakeJakko has quit: Read error: Connection reset by peer

[23:45] <xales> Hallicarnassuss: "With Beta comes a larger focus on polish and content, and we’ll start early on with adding proper modding support with a stable API,"

[23:45] <fork> heh

[23:46] <Mbloker> Does anyone know how i can get onto a sever. like craft hub? i have not played Minecraft in a few months.

[23:46] * Guest756649748 has quit: Quit: Client Exited

[23:46] <xales> Mbloker: download the game and find a server

[23:46] <fork> i want the laser guided missile mod

[23:46] <Hallicarnassuss> xales: Note the fact he said proper.

[23:46] <fork> and i want a helicopter

[23:46] <fork> a helicopter sure would rule

[23:46] <Cial> xales, it will not do any good ive been waving my banner for months

[23:46] <xales> Hallicarnassuss: yes, through an official way. not editing the source code

[23:46] <fork> and if i could fire the missiles from the helicopter

[23:46] <fork> i think i would jizz myself

[23:46] <Terrance> I want cheese

[23:46] <xales> Cial: I'll mention it to them for you

[23:46] <fork> id like to be able to mine via projectiles

[23:46] <Mbloker> Anyone remeber me?

[23:46] <xales> im not special, but I can always put it right infront of em

[23:47] <teah1> yeah, flyin inworld ala opensim is great

[23:47] <xales> :P

[23:47] <fork> also some special goggles that detect the presence of iron/gold/diamond would be nice too

[23:47] <Hallicarnassuss> xales: Hence, meaning he supports it.

[23:47] <Cial> xales, they all know my standpoint on modding and they dont care ive told them more times than one that its bull shit

[23:47] <Terrance> I think flying would be cool

[23:47] <fork> ive only played vanilla mc

[23:47] <Hallicarnassuss> xales: Remove proper in that sentence.

[23:47] <Terrance> Maybe ahot air baloon

[23:47] <Cial> Mbloker, vaguely

[23:47] <xales> Hallicarnassuss: proper meaning through a way its meant to be done

[23:47] * Elexor has joined #minecraft.

[23:47] <fork> how do mc mods work. are they server side? or do both server and client require the mod

[23:47] * magick has quit: Ping timeout: 180 seconds

[23:47] <xales> the intent isn't to release a closed-source game for money to have people edit the source code

[23:47] <Mbloker> @ Cial okay good

[23:47] <Terrance> Or some thing along thelines of comples crafting

[23:47] <xales> im not going to argue with you any more

[23:47] <Hallicarnassuss> Sigh... everyone stop arguing. It's all utterly pointless.

[23:48] <Hallicarnassuss> I had this same arguent with someone else.

[23:48] <Mbloker> I need to know how to get onto crafthub

[23:48] <fork> im yapping aimlessly

[23:48] <xales> regardless of if notch supports it

[23:48] <xales> #minecraft does not

[23:48] <Elexor> stop arguing and ruining the "christmas spirit" :P

[23:48] <Hallicarnassuss> Uhhuh...

[23:48] <Elexor> Then i guess it is ok

[23:48] <Cial> xales, yes yes we know its been like this for months because people can not take a mature standpoint on the subject
