[0:20] <Farn> no news
[0:20] <Farn> daytime out side!
[0:20] <Viral> the real problem i have with that comic
[0:20] <vurtual> The most interesting people I know are the least predictable.
[0:20] <Viral> is that they only checked him 4 times
[0:20] <Farn> duh no slimes
[0:20] <Viral> >_>
[0:21] <Shrub> hm, who was it that made Asplod in the first place?

[0:22] <Farn> yeah
[0:22] <CyborgDragon> okay, i exaggerated a little
[0:22] <CyborgDragon> the entire island wasnt covered in shrooms

[1:06] <CyborgDragon> it's paper reeds or papyrus sedges, not bamboo
[1:06] <Shrub> don't be a nazi cyborg
[1:06] <Epitaph64> w/e it's called lol
[1:06] <CyborgDragon> but it's not bamboo!
[1:07] <Epitaph64> I call them reeds
[1:07] <CyborgDragon> reeds is fine
[1:07] <Shrub> maybe Notch invented Bamboo paper
[1:07] <CyborgDragon> just dont call em bamboo
[1:07] <Epitaph64> in actuality, they are variables stored in RAM
[1:07] <vede> CyborgDragon, it looks more like bamboo than papyrus.
[1:07] <CyborgDragon> the only way to make paper from bamboo at the moment is to make paper using panda poop
[1:07] <CyborgDragon> which china is doing a lot of
[1:07] <Shrub> >invented
[1:07] * mrlolop (mrlolop@67.158.145.62) has joined #minecraft
[1:08] <Shrub> also there is no china or pandas in minecraft
[1:08] <CyborgDragon> vede, just because it doesnt have the fronds on the top like a paper reed does, doesnt mean it's not paper reed
[1:08] <Pelum> i dunno i might make a panda skin
[1:08] <TrueWolves|Sleeping> MineCrafters make a special paper out of a bamboo like plant that doesn't have a Real world counter part but we assume is reeds or papyrus becuase paper is made from it. In reality a lot of things in this world of MineCraft don't have real life counter parts and we argue over names for them on false grounds all the time.

[1:09] <CyborgDragon> paper reeds look like bamboo but have fronds at the top
[1:09] <TrueWolves|Sleeping> Alright gdude.
[1:09] <CyborgDragon> which in fact, bamboo does have too
[1:09] <vede> CyborgDragon, not just because it doesn't have the fronds, but because it looks completely different from what a papyrus plant looks like.
[1:09] <CyborgDragon> however, bamboo can grow more than 4 meters tall
[1:09] <CyborgDragon> vede, it looks like a papyrus plant

[1:28] <Pelum> :(
[1:28] <Epitaph64> do you also ramp up the alien spawns for that?
[1:28] <Meow> Almost all the games on that desktop are pirated
[1:29] <Meow> As is photoshop >.>
[1:29] <Epitaph64> I can't hold it against anyone for pirating certain things, like Photoshop haha
[1:29] <CyborgDragon> epitaph64, i dont ramp up the alien spawns for 6 player, i enable the zombie director from the l4d2 engine

[1:29] <Meow> Well hell Photoshop is crazy expensive
[1:29] <Epitaph64> then I'll start screwing around with the settings and look for mods
[1:30] <Epitaph64> Photoshop is 1 - the only decent image editing software (I know I'll get rebuttals about Gimp, yadda yadda) and 2 - costs a fortune

[1:38] <TheDarthWater> for some reason, the second time i run creative mode, it gives a black screen.

[1:39] <Meow> What I want him to fix
[1:39] <Viral> your pick breaks
[1:39] <Epitaph64> you could just right click on stairs to rotate them
[1:39] <Meow> Is the double door thing where without redstone, one is open and one is closed
[1:39] <Viral> when that happend, you never used to get the bit you were mining
[1:39] <Hawkzombie> Wonder if anyone knows this: Does bamboo spawn on snow maps?

[1:42] <Epitaph64> Darth, console log?
[1:42] <Hawkzombie> Ep, that actually makes some sense
[1:42] <CyborgDragon> TheDarthWater, the black screen is caused by java not loading at all
[1:42] <Hawkzombie> I wanna start over too, but I don't wanna lose the stuff I have lol
[1:42] <Meow> Lolol
[1:42] <CyborgDragon> or crashing as it tries to start
[1:43] <Epitaph64> yeah, I wouldn't feel "bad" about not wasting your time to get the bare essentials

[2:10] <Epitaph64> anyone think of anything that slime balls could be used for really?
[2:10] <Peerko> I assumed they were jelly
[2:10] <Epitaph64> I tried throwing some at a slime to see if it would make it grow
[2:10] <CyborgDragon> epitaph, like snowballs
[2:10] <Epitaph64> it did not
[2:10] <Epitaph64> lol
[2:10] <Dommys> I thought of something cool yesterday
[2:10] <CyborgDragon> only they slow you down for a time
[2:10] <Dommys> Boots + Slime
[2:10] <Dommys> = Bouncy Boots
[2:10] <Shrub> Alchemy?
[2:10] <Epitaph64> I think he'll probably use the slime balls as an adhesive in recipes
[2:10] <Dommys> Jump +1 higher
[2:10] <CyborgDragon> also, as shrub said
[2:10] <Shrub> Food?
[2:10] <CyborgDragon> alchemy, when notch adds it
[2:11] <RenoFox> is there a way I can force my oven to face a certain way? =/

[2:12] <Plinky> It'll be for alchemy
[2:12] <Dommys> In alot of fantasy worlds, it is
[2:12] <Epitaph64> I still think notch should add oil reservoirs underground
[2:12] <Dommys> It's worth considering

[2:15] <CyborgDragon> any of them can go anywhere on the body, but the most common on the face is simplex A, and the most common STD form is simplex B

[2:15] <CyborgDragon> however the STD can be simplex B or C
[2:16] <Farn> tif you want to grow them,make them 3 blocks high
[2:16] <Farn> treeds can be 3 blocks high
[2:16] <CyborgDragon> errr
[2:16] <CyborgDragon> A or C*
[2:16] <Epitaph64> harvesting the reeds is pretty fun for awhile
[2:16] <CyborgDragon> basically what im saying is, any of the herpes simplexes can be anywhere, but they're most common in certain areas

[3:38] <CyborgDragon> they magically appear
[3:39] <Pelum> i made my own win looking cacti
[3:39] <Ivorius> yeah
[3:39] <Kandit> Tronberry cacti
[3:39] <Jimmars> Would be pretty fun
[3:39] <Ivorius> but I hope they grow like wheed or Papyrus
[3:39] <Pelum> because having them grow 2blocks up is lame
[3:39] <Ivorius> then I can make a third farm
[3:39] <Jimmars> On like a bed.
[3:39] <Snowman> wheat*
[3:39] <Jimmars> with a laptop on my belly.
[3:39] <Pelum> well spawn 2blocks up anyway
[3:39] <Jimmars> un the sun
[3:39] <Plinky> I want a Cactuar style monster.
[3:39] <Jimmars> ore somthing.
[3:39] <Pelum> i made a cactus in the shape of cactuar
[3:39] <Pelum> >__>
[3:40] <Ivorius> An I want to be able to take books
[3:40] <Ivorius> and write on them
[3:40] <Ivorius> and then put them back in the shelf
[3:40] <Ivorius> that wold be cool
[3:40] <Plinky> Pelum, you rock.
[3:40] <Pelum> Dear Diary,
[3:40] <Pelum> Today i went back into the mine with the nasty spider in it.
[3:40] <Pelum> He didn't play nice, i died and respawned back at my house.
[3:40] <Pelum> I guess that cave will have to wait for another day
[3:40] <Pelum> Pel
[3:41] <Kandit> We should have metal boats that just take damage when you run into things too fast
[3:41] <Plinky> Kandit, minecarts!
[3:41] <CyborgDragon> the boat breaking needs tweaking
[3:41] * Jimmars (Mibbit@83.119.203.229) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[3:41] <Pelum> i think if you hit something it should smash up but if you break it with say an axe, you get ur boat back
[3:41] <CyborgDragon> if you're coasting along the coast and ever so slightly bump into the coast, say at an 89 degree angle
[3:41] <CyborgDragon> it'll still break
[3:42] <Pelum> or better yet coat it in slime so it slides across things
[3:42] <Pelum> >__>
[3:42] <CyborgDragon> oh man, i love the new tnt cannons
[3:42] <asiekierka> tnt cannons? O_O
[3:42] <CyborgDragon> the new cannons that dont blow themselves up are epic
[3:42] <Pelum> mmm
[3:43] <CyborgDragon> basically, tnt that falls into water wont damage any blocks, but will still propel entities

[4:18] <Drakkar> no no
[4:18] <Brotagonist> so you can fall down the hole onto slime, and then climb up.
[4:18] <Drakkar> slime arrows would be like paint balls
[4:18] <RenoFox> is there any use for gravel?

[5:35] <CyborgDragon> i made the gorman brothers cry as they chased me and cremia
[5:35] <Shrub> Game?
[5:35] <Shrub> I thought we moved on
[5:35] <Bearodactyl> "This game is good because my friends play it with me"
[5:35] <Shrub> to arguing about Online vs. Offline
[5:35] <CyborgDragon> and i was even lucky enough to get cremia's hug
[5:35] <Bearodactyl> "WaW is good because my friends play it with me"
[5:36] <Shrub> WaW is good because it's a fun game
[5:36] <Bodie> sup friends
[5:36] <Bearodactyl> why is it fun? general imbalance on the online game or gay split screen on the offline?
[5:36] <Bearodactyl> has to be one of them
[5:36] <Shrub> It had sweet split screen
[5:36] <CyborgDragon> i literally did every boss and every person in the bomber's notebook(except the bomb shop lady) within one 3 day cycle, and helped people not in the bomber's notebook
[5:36] <Wildstyle> Im scared now of those slimes Zuriki
[5:36] <Wildstyle> also
[5:36] <Shrub> and imbalance is only bad if you suck
[5:36] <Bearodactyl> then all games have sweet split screen
[5:36] <Helar> LAN partys are the way to go
[5:36] <Wildstyle> What do you people think of my charcoal idea
[5:36] <Shrub> Yes
[5:36] <Shrub> all games have sweet split screen
[5:36] <Bearodactyl> lol, god mode vs baby mode is imbalance
[5:37] <Wildstyle> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=19941
[5:37] <Bearodactyl> the fact that now, absolutely 8/12 people a match use one specific sniper rifle
[5:37] <Bearodactyl> means there's imbalance
[5:37] <Bearodactyl> not that everyone sucks
[5:37] <Shrub> No
[5:37] <Helar> Split screen is stupid... The opponent can see where you are
[5:37] <Bearodactyl> means imbalance
[5:37] <Shrub> that means 4/12 people are idiots
[5:37] <Bearodactyl> Helar: YES
[5:37] <Shrub> What the fuck
[5:37] <Bearodactyl> shrub....then it's not WaW
[5:37] <Shrub> that's the -point- of split screen
[5:37] <Bearodactyl> it's, "Shoot around with one sniper rifle"
[5:37] <Shrub> No
[5:37] * BarryLikesBnBns is now known as BnBns
[5:37] <Shrub> I'm pretty sure
[5:37] <Shrub> it's still WaW
[5:37] <Bearodactyl> lol, because it's easy if you know the map better than someone else
[5:38] <Bearodactyl> that's called imbalance
[5:38] <Shrub> It's not like you change games to "Shoot around with one sniper rifle"
[5:38] <Shrub> because
[5:38] <Bearodactyl> you just like having imbalance as long as you're in advantage
[5:38] <Shrub> that's a terrible title for a game
[5:38] <Shrub> I'm never in an advantage
[5:38] <Shrub> but I still have fun
[5:38] <Shrub> because I'm not weird

[5:38] <Shrub> Nobody kills me constantly

[5:39] <Bearodactyl> I'm good too, and I don't always win
[5:39] <Shrub> The imbalance is people can't aim for shit.

[5:39] <Wildstyle> GUYS GUYS GUYS
[5:39] <Shrub> and I take advantage of that.
[5:39] <Ominus> the only people that dont like split screen are campers and snipers
[5:39] <Wildstyle> None of you are right!
[5:39] <Bearodactyl> WILDSTYLE: SHUT THE FUCK UP
[5:39] <Bearodactyl> now, shrub
[5:39] <Shrub> I'm both of those and I love split screen.
[5:39] <Bodie> i played laser tag last night
[5:39] <Bodie> there was a guy camping
[5:39] <Shrub> Laser Tag rocks hard
[5:39] <Ominus> lol xD
[5:39] <Bodie> and sniping
[5:39] <Bearodactyl> you can't camp on split screen....
[5:39] <Ominus> i love you too Shrub <3
[5:39] <Shrub> Bearodactyl: Yes you can
[5:39] <Shrub> what the fuck
[5:40] <Shrub> do you really suck that much
[5:40] <Bearodactyl> how?
[5:40] <Bearodactyl> they know where you are...
[5:40] <Shrub> You, you know
[5:40] <Shrub> camp
[5:40] <Bearodactyl> no...my friends don't suck that much...
[5:40] <Bodie> you can but its not as effective
[5:40] <Shrub> go behind a door
[5:40] <Shrub> and sit there
[5:40] <Bearodactyl> "you're behind the door"
[5:40] <bleak> woo finally got my logic gate working
[5:40] <Bearodactyl> "i looked at your screen your behind the door"
[5:40] <bleak> I was just using the wrong gate
[5:40] <Bearodactyl> "*grenade in door*"
[5:40] <Shrub> So what if they know?
[5:40] <Bearodactyl> "shit, you looked at my screen, splitscreen sucks, let's take turns on online"
[5:40] <Shrub> Taking turns sucks
[5:40] <Bearodactyl> so it doesn't work! the entire point of camping is suprising people in one location
[5:40] <Shrub> No
[5:41] <Shrub> the point of camping
[5:41] <Wildstyle> No it isn't
[5:41] <Bearodactyl> 'cause your impatient and selfish and want the controller so bad
[5:41] <Shrub> is taking tacitcal advantage
[5:41] <Shrub> in a location
[5:41] <vede> I don't like splitscreen because cutting a screen in half ruins my ability to really get into the game.
[5:41] <Bearodactyl> lol...suprising people in one location....

[5:41] <Farn> ooh
[5:41] <Shrub> see veede actually has an argument
[5:41] <Wildstyle> Camping is the act of staying in one location for an amount of time
[5:41] <Farn> notch is streaming im watching
[5:41] <Bearodactyl> ...are you five?
[5:41] <Bearodactyl> I've presented multiple, can you not discern?
[5:41] <Wildstyle> not being hidden or surprizing someone
[5:41] <Shrub> It's hardly ever about surprise
[5:41] <Bodie> god, who cares
[5:41] <Farn> http://www.livestream.com/mojang
[5:41] <Bodie> shutup
[5:41] <Bearodactyl> wildstyle: what?
[5:41] <Shrub> Bearodactly: No, you're present multiple weak arguments.
[5:41] <Bodie> is #mcchatter quieter than this?
[5:42] <Bodie> i want to talk minecraft
[5:42] <vede> I actually love taking turns with friends in online play.
[5:42] <Bodie> not talk faggotry with these two
[5:42] <Shrub> Bodie: Then leave
[5:42] <Bearodactyl> shrub: if you played online, you would never not be suprised by a camper unless you uh, knew where he was, like in split screen
[5:42] <Shrub> I played online
[5:42] <Shrub> there were no campers
[5:42] <Shrub> nobody camps in online
[5:42] <Bearodactyl> actually, they aren't weak, they are deductions not inductions
[5:42] <Darkfire02> [Prototype]
[5:42] <Wildstyle> Guys does it really matter?
[5:42] <Shrub> No
[5:42] <Wildstyle> Campers are not bad
[5:42] <Shrub> but we're arguing anyway
[5:42] <Farn> but notch is playing infdev =S
[5:42] <Wildstyle> its a tactical advantage
[5:42] * xRDVx places a tent.
[5:42] <Bearodactyl> they can't possibly be weak, only valid or invalid, and my premises are so related to my conclusion that they can only be valid
[5:42] <Wildstyle> and smart people use it
[5:43] <Shrub> I never understood why people think camping is so dishonorable
[5:43] <vede> I dunno if you're talking about a specific game, Shrub, so you might be right, but I've seen a lot of campers in online games.
[5:43] <Bearodactyl> inductions can be strong or weak
[5:43] <Wildstyle> instead of Running through the main door of a building all guns blasing
[5:43] <cheezychicken> :O barrels!
[5:43] <Bearodactyl> shrub: it's not dishonorable
[5:43] <Bearodactyl> it just doesn't work in split screen
[5:43] <Shrub> The only game where I find campers is Counter-Strike
[5:43] <Wildstyle> Its because it's smart and people find it hard to take campers down
[5:43] <Bearodactyl> like, period, it can't unless you're playing idiots

[5:45] <liq3> yep
[5:45] <vede> liq3, it's not about being overpowered, it's about spawning into bullets not being fun.
[5:45] <Viral> of how to avoid spawncamping
[5:45] <Bearodactyl> lol, reverse spawn killer
[5:45] <Bearodactyl> that's why I don't mind spawn killing
[5:45] <Shrub> lolspermwhale
[5:45] <liq3> if you can spawn camp in TF2 for more then a minute or 2, enemy team sucks.
[5:45] <Bearodactyl> because sometimes I reversespawnkill
[5:45] <Bearodactyl> and that's hilarious and fun and I have a helicopter because I spawned in the middle of enemies
[5:45] <Wildstyle> Not if the team is smart
[5:45] <Wildstyle> and uses a different exit point
[5:45] <Shrub> guys
[5:45] <Shrub> what teh FUCK are we even discussing anymore
[5:45] <Wildstyle> BS
[5:45] <Bearodactyl> whatever the FUCK we want?

[5:45] <Wildstyle> Ok
[5:45] <vede> Whenever I reflexively shoot someone on the opposing team and then I see that they just spawned, I feel like a jackass.
[5:45] <Bearodactyl> sorry
[5:45] <Zeph> downside to tf2's spawn camp prevention is if the other time blows you can sit outside spawn for 5 minutes waiting for a round to end while they all stay inside
[5:45] <Viral> oh fuck trem

[6:28] <Keiya> Or cactus, for that matter...
[6:28] <River-> You need no plugin

[6:28] <Quatroking> How about chaning 9. Do not auto-join. into 9. Do not auto-join. After being kicked, wait at least a minute before rejoining.

[8:08] <bearz> 9
[8:08] <RightLegRed> 9 indeed.
[8:08] <Outpost> They appear on peaceful, in fully lit cave areas, they clip through walls, and can perma-stun/hurt you.
[8:09] <bleak> but i did get killed by a slime on my first map which was kind of irritating
[8:09] <RightLegRed> Perma-stun?
[8:09] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> I'ma fail on infdev
[8:09] <RightLegRed> That sounds crappy.
[8:09] <Outpost> Yeah, there was a few situations in my cave where a slime just bounced at me and did my entire heart's of damage (with iron armor on) before I could even quickswap to a sword.
[8:09] <RightLegRed> That sounds awesome.

[8:27] <wolf_alex> or
[8:27] <OpalMist> questions: Only if you remain gramatically correct.
[8:27] <Fiskie> wait what the fuck
[8:27] <wolf_alex> forever stick to that :D
[8:27] <questions> If I place it along the shore on some grass will it grow? Like taller?

[8:27] <vede> Yes, questions.
[8:27] <Kokopure> questions, that's the absolute only way it will grow.
[8:27] <wolf_alex> fiskie you havent noticed? their bugged or can squeeze
[8:28] <Cial> hm tumblr did die :/ it worked a little bit ago
[8:28] <Kokopure> it can only grow on dirt/grass that is bordered directly by water.
[8:28] <Kokopure> however
[8:28] <OpalMist> questions: Where you can place it, it can grow.
[8:28] <Kokopure> OpalMist, false.
[8:28] <Fiskie> I don't call appearing inside blocks squeezing
[8:28] <OpalMist> Kokopure: Ok
[8:28] <Kokopure> you can place it in any space that is currently occupied with water.
[8:28] <OpalMist> Kokopure: Except on itself
[8:28] <Kokopure> for example
[8:28] <Kokopure> if you dig a hole in rock
[8:28] <Kokopure> and fill it with water
[8:28] <OpalMist> if it's above 2
[8:28] <OpalMist> oh
[8:28] <Kokopure> you can plant a papyrus plant in that hole, and it will replace the water.
[8:28] <OpalMist> ok
[8:28] <Kokopure> however
[8:28] <Kokopure> it will not grow
[8:28] <Kokopure> it will stay there for a while, and then die.
[8:29] <Kokopure> you can probably plant more papyrus on top, though.
[8:29] <Quatroking> ah yeah
[8:29] <Quatroking> who did the minecasts again?
[8:29] <Shrub> Important Question: What do I DL, Alien Swarm or TF2?
[8:29] <Kokopure> as for "watered dirt", that crops grow on
[8:29] <OpalMist> Kokopure: Pff. Bugger off with your greater knowledge.
[8:29] <RightLegRed> TF2
[8:29] <Vic> shrub: both
[8:29] <questions> Thank you everyone! This is the first stalk I've ever found, good bye everyone!
[8:29] <Kokopure> I don't know if papyrus can grow on such a tile, but I doubt it can.
[8:29] <liq3> Shrub: or
[8:29] <OpalMist> Kokopure: I bite my thumb at thee.
[8:29] <liq3> Shrub: both.
[8:29] <Kokopure> D:
[8:29] <Shrub> No my downloads are a precious resource I cannot waste it on both
[8:29] <Kokopure> Shrub, you have to download both.
[8:29] <Shrub> I will
[8:29] <liq3> ^
[8:29] <Shrub> in a month
[8:30] <Shrub> but only one for now
[8:30] <Kokopure> if you mean which one you should download first
[8:30] <Kokopure> then, I would say
[8:30] <wolf_alex> shrub
[8:30] <liq3> Shrub: tf2
[8:30] <Kokopure> proooobably Alien Swarm.
[8:30] <wolf_alex> tf2
[8:30] <Kokopure> Alien Swarm is free, and smaller
[8:30] <wolf_alex> tf2 tf2 tf2
[8:30] <Kokopure> TF2 is very fun, however
[8:30] <Shrub> I've got about 2GB left on the TF2 download
[8:30] <RightLegRed> TF2 has spies.
[8:30] <Shrub> so it'd be the same size :/
[8:30] <wolf_alex> alien swarm might not run
[8:30] <Kokopure> eh?
[8:30] <Fiskie> Alien Swarm gets boring
[8:30] <wolf_alex> tf2 will
[8:30] <liq3> Yeh.
[8:30] <Kokopure> are Alien Swarm's system requirements higher than TF2's?
[8:30] <Vic> fiskie: only because there's no new maps
[8:30] <wolf_alex> I cant run alien swarm :(
[8:30] <liq3> Alien swarm needs more dynamicness.
[8:30] <Shrub> The whole 1st Person modification for AS seems so awesome though
[8:31] <Vic> koko: not really, but it's on a newer Source version
[8:31] <Kokopure> Alien Swarm is also freeeee
[8:31] <Kokopure> Shrub, there's a first person mode o.o?
[8:31] <Kokopure> how do get?
[8:31] <Shrub> You can get 1st person
[8:31] <liq3> Someone needs to part all the TF2 classes to alien swarm.
[8:31] <liq3> lol.
[8:31] <Vic> alien swarm is closer to left 4 dead 2
[8:31] <liq3> port*
[8:31] <Kokopure> I dunno.
[8:31] <Shrub> by using developer's thingy
[8:31] <Shrub> Not sure of the codes
[8:31] <wolf_alex> kokopure yes on my crapy grapics card it stinks
[8:31] <Vic> shrub: nope
[8:31] <Kokopure> to me, Alien Swarm is a mashup of L4D and TF2
[8:31] <Shrub> but it's absolute fear
[8:31] <Miclee> Alien Swarm is a L4D port, basically
[8:31] <Vic> you just put in a command
[8:31] <wolf_alex> BOO INTERGRATED GRAPHICS
[8:31] <Miclee> They even forgot to remove half of the L4D model references
[8:31] <Miclee> >_>
[8:31] <Vic> miclee no it isnt
[8:31] <Miclee> It is
[8:31] <Kokopure> I mean, you have the medigun, the sentries, the minigun, the flamethrower, the sniper rifle
[8:31] <Kokopure> seriously
[8:31] <liq3> Vic: It is.
[8:32] <Kokopure> it's Left4Fortress2
[8:32] <Shrub> I'm starting to learn towards TF2
[8:32] <Vic> left 4 dead 2 if anything
[8:32] <Miclee> The survivor models are all still referenced in the ASW source
[8:32] <liq3> Shrub: tf2 is better for a month.

[8:52] <Vic> RLR: subjective question
[8:52] <Drakkar> i was pretty sure you could dump anything in there
[8:52] <Namzo> cacti takes forever to grow
[8:52] <Drakkar> er
[8:52] <Vic> realistic texturepacks are dumb
[8:52] <Drakkar> anything conceivably burnable
[8:52] <Drakkar> it just didn't work too well
[8:53] <Keiya> Drakkar: It's not flagged burnable
[8:53] <Wirtualnosc> Best texture pack, you say?
[8:53] <Keiya> I'll try bamboo and paper
[8:53] <Randomnation> Is it 2 weeks now
[8:53] <Wirtualnosc> Notch's texture pack.
[8:53] <Prow> I don't know why but with this texture pack everything looks bigger
[8:53] <Drakkar> it should be

[8:53] <Prow> Yeah, i agree with Wirtualnosc
[8:54] <Wirtualnosc> So yeah, standard texture pack is enough good for me
[8:54] <Vic> quite.
[8:54] <RightLegRed> Vic, 3D dot heroes looks nice
[8:54] <NinjaBunny> yea same
[8:54] <bearz> i hope that notch makes those skinnable flags :3
[8:54] <Kokopure> custom flags YES!
[8:55] <Keiya> Custom paintings :P
[8:55] <NinjaBunny> Does anyone know a way to reduce lag a little? cuz sometimes i just start lagging and i cant even play the game its so bad D:
[8:55] <Vic> from now on anyone who uses HD custom textures will be called a graphics whore

[9:00] <Vic> i mean, he's making the game
[9:00] <Keiya> I don't know what my laptop uses

[9:14] <So_Useless> According to some recent research, suicide bombers aren't all that fanatical. They are acctually pants-shittingly terrified before their deed. They are mostly people with the type of personality that defers to authority.
[9:14] <ElderKain> ne1 have any Skinning guides to make custom player skins? I just bought it and i need some help in knowing what places on the skin makes what sides on the wireframe.
[9:14] <So_Useless> So, they are just doing it because their terrorist boss told them to.

[9:16] <Keiya> For instance, if they're caught during planning
[9:16] <bleak> I've heard it from soldiers stationed in iraq and such places that they're actually coerced into doing that kind of thing by threatening to kill their entire family if they don't sacrifice themselves for allah.

[9:31] <Kokopure> which is not refrigerated
[9:31] <Willox303> eww
[9:31] <bleak> yeah the slimes are quite intermittent
[9:31] <Willox303> itll go lumpy
[9:31] <Kokopure> I know.
[9:31] <RenoFox> Omg! finally got my 1st piece of diamond! only took 1.5 large storage full of stone to get 2 pieces... xD
[9:31] <Kokopure> seriously
[9:31] <Willox303> put it in the furnace quick
[9:31] <bleak> wow my compute rjust shat a brick

[9:31] <Willox303> Not for me >:3
[9:31] <Kokopure> you should die the moment you take a bite.
[9:31] <Conundrumer> is there a thread on how to fight slimes?
[9:32] <Willox303> With a bucket of lava
[9:32] <Willox303> Thats how i killed my first spider
[9:32] <bleak> fight slimes with a bow
[9:32] <bleak> the end.
[9:32] <Willox303> it resulted in my death aswell
[9:32] <Conundrumer> well yea
[9:32] <SireTRM> Kokopure, 1728:1 physical compression ratios?
[9:32] <Conundrumer> lava's the strongest weapon, but it kills you too

[9:32] <bleak> i really wish you could uncraft cloth blocks into string so you could make bows easily
[9:32] <bleak> how does the fire from flint + iron work?

[9:33] <bleak> Siiseli rarer? not like you can't kill 2 spiders right off the bat man
[9:33] <wolf_alex> spider silk blocks should make silk blocks as oposed to cloth blocks
[9:33] <Kokopure> it means having to smite at least two spiders before you're allowed to handle a long-range weapon.
[9:33] <Naxza> And the difference would be...?
[9:33] <Kokopure> it's a test of courage!
[9:34] <bleak> hehe
[9:34] <bleak> well I can't argue with that
[9:34] <Kokopure> Naxza, silk armor renders you FIREPROOF >:3
[9:34] <Kokopure> but offers zero protective capability.
[9:34] <Willox303> Putting sand above lava makes it turn into lava?
[9:34] <bleak> i'm just a courageous motherfucker with my wooden swords and what have you.
[9:34] <Willox303> If so, can i put it above non source and then pick it up with a bucket? inf lava from sand :D

[9:40] <Randomnation> YES.
[9:40] <Kokopure> not really
[9:40] <Willox303> Unless you want to make a golden elevator ofcourseee
[9:40] <Ivorius> Thats because i want coins
[9:40] <Boyofcheese> COINS ARE A TERRIBLE IDEA
[9:40] <Kokopure> you can make golden apples with it.

[9:40] <Kokopure> which is a last-ditch healer for all health.

[9:41] <Willox303> so
[9:41] <Kokopure> for the bling bling
[9:41] <Fiskie> Not worth the cost of 8 gold blocks

[9:41] <Fiskie> Golden apple should just be a decorative item
[9:41] <LordAidan> What is wrong eith coins?
[9:41] <bleak> I want a leather sword and a ham helmet and glass armor. and gold shoes. at least i can have that last one!
[9:41] <LordAidan> If a server wants them
[9:41] <Fiskie> As to say, "look at me, I mined this much fucking gold"
[9:41] <Cial> eh coins would be ok in RP situations
[9:42] <LordAidan> they can modify some software or whatever
[9:42] <LordAidan> and add them, I guess
[9:42] <bleak> Oh yeah I want a cloth shovel too.
[9:42] <LordAidan> If a server doesnt want them, they dont.
[9:42] <LordAidan> problem solved.
[9:42] <Willox303> Options
[9:42] <palamedes> boyofcheese: where do you think coin economies come from?
[9:42] <Willox303> so much better
[9:42] <Boyofcheese> I still dont like coins, MC shouldnt be an rpg

[9:43] <cheezychicken> so you use gold bars as currency
[9:43] <cheezychicken> if you want
[9:43] <Helar> gold is for your treasure room
[9:43] <LordAidan> That's a kinda stupid thing to say Boy
[9:43] <Helar> so plunderers could find it
[9:43] <Willox303> Does it say allaIs there a thing with every button of minecraft somewhere? i only just found f5 by accident
[9:43] <palamedes> barter systems naturally give rise to currency economies as volume of trade increases and communication allows a certain amount of standardization of value

[9:54] <Willox303> I noticed a problem with my island
[9:54] <SireTRM> Darn 360 exclusives.
[9:54] <Willox303> Theres no possible way to get to a cave from it
[9:54] <SireTRM> Willox303, make your own cave.
[9:54] <bleak> playing halo for the campaign mode is like playing chess for the campaign mode

[9:56] <Rooster> I don't see what's so wrong with it.
[9:56] <Willox303> I jsut fell into a natural hole which was a ready made house with space for a door and everything + underground
[9:56] <SireTRM> I ought to get a legal Mac Universal Binary version for some multiplayer.

[9:57] <Keiya> SireTRM: Uh?
[9:58] <Keiya> Oh, PC version
[9:58] <Rooster> *BR
[9:58] <SireTRM> Oh, you are talking about the 360 versions that require Live.

[9:58] <Link2006> It does keiya
[9:58] <Keiya> It's old enough Live didn't exist when they wrote it
[9:58] <Merciless> has anyone ever come across a massively tall yet massivly flat piece of land
[9:58] <SireTRM> Halo:CE uses Gamespy, I'm pretty sure.
[9:58] <Willox303> Yes

[11:05] <SielickiN> oh. damn.
[11:05] <vurtual> I'm a ways ahead of where you needed the longbeam
[11:05] <sageofrage> guys what's milk for?
[11:05] <Dommys> Nothing yet
[11:05] <vurtual> Marrying your buckets.
[11:05] <sageofrage> god damnit, waste of 5 god damn buckets
[11:05] <jasper> creeper food
[11:05] <Conundrumer> hahaha
[11:05] <Conundrumer> i think milk should use the bowl instead of bucket
[11:05] <Conundrumer> since buckets are a bit expensive
[11:05] <ColdFusion> why ?
[11:05] <vurtual> but milking is done... into buckets.
[11:05] <ColdFusion> ohh
[11:06] <vurtual> also wheat should be craftable into cereal
[11:06] <vurtual> craft cereal+milk+bowl
[11:06] <ColdFusion> You probably get the bucket back when you use the milk
[11:06] <Link2006> :D
[11:06] <vurtual> create a disgusting weapon
[11:06] <ColdFusion> making it less expensive
[11:06] <Conundrumer> does milk have power equivalent to picking up water/lava sources?

[11:11] <Conundrumer> wolf_alex some simple omen-ing
[11:11] <Fiskie> If I had a decent upload speed I'd run a server
[11:11] <Merciless> not mined it at all
[11:11] <Fiskie> But no it's shite
[11:11] <Fiskie> Fuck you BT
[11:11] <wolf_alex> conun if its so easy to you can you do it for me?
[11:11] <Conundrumer> grassland with lower ground level
[11:11] <Pelum|Sleep> my clan has a server thats up 24hours aday
[11:11] <wolf_alex> I stink
[11:11] <wolf_alex> I dunno omens
[11:11] <Conundrumer> generating maps takes a while for my cmoputer, since it's slow
[11:11] <Pelum|Sleep> dont think anyone uses it anymore tho
[11:11] <Kodaichi> lol
[11:11] <wolf_alex> ok :(
[11:12] <Kodaichi> I generate a new level, click away from the window, so when it loads up it auto-pauses
[11:12] <Redshift> oh
[11:12] <Redshift> which maps?
[11:12] <Kodaichi> now my char is underground, about to be rocketed to the surface, and I can see a diamond ore from here
[11:12] <Kodaichi> what a tease
[11:12] <wolf_alex> well if you still have a copy I want the one when I came around, the one with the triforces
[11:12] <Conundrumer> okay, so i want to build a lighthouse using lava and doors that open on and off
[11:12] <wolf_alex> besides that...
[11:12] <Fiskie> ..Then go do it
[11:12] <wolf_alex> one before it went down for a while
[11:12] <Conundrumer> specifically, a lighthouse that "turns on" and off, and one that looks like the light is rotating
[11:12] <wolf_alex> I dont want the one with a huge jaul
[11:13] <wolf_alex> jail*
[11:13] <Conundrumer> but I'm wonder if I should combine the two
[11:13] <wolf_alex> conun that is easy isint it?
[11:13] <Conundrumer> making a toggling lighthouse? no
[11:13] <wolf_alex> clock with 2 outputs/ 1 output that branches
[11:13] <Conundrumer> wiring's not easy
[11:13] <wolf_alex> 1 has an inverter
[11:13] <Redshift> oh that fractal map
[11:13] <wolf_alex> well thats true
[11:13] <Redshift> i lost the code for generating that
[11:14] <Conundrumer> the logic is easy
[11:14] <Willox303> Back
[11:14] <wolf_alex> redshift what do you have then?
[11:14] <Pelum|Sleep> its easy enough to setup, but your lighthouse would need to be fairly big
[11:14] <wolf_alex> mostly all I want is

[11:14] <Dommys> Anyone need some wood?
[11:14] <Dommys> I have a surplus
[11:14] <wolf_alex> and the ground with hills
[11:14] <Redshift> omen can probably do a good enough job for that
[11:14] <Conundrumer> a circular "rotating" one and a simple square one
[11:14] <Pelum|Sleep> sure why not and post pics
[11:14] <Pelum|Sleep> :D
[11:14] <SireTRM> I can hack all the wood I need.
[11:14] <wolf_alex> I dont know how though :(

[11:15] <Dommys> Moostal code 118425
[11:15] <Jevon> i joke
[11:16] <ColdFusion> to create a roting light you just need a long chain of inverters and connect a few of them to to some redstone torches
[11:16] <Conundrumer> i know
[11:16] <Conundrumer> it's going to take up a lot of space
[11:16] <Jevon> Redstone torches suck for light though
[11:16] <Conundrumer> and that's why I wonder if I should make it a seperate light house
[11:16] <Conundrumer> I'm using doors and lava

[12:07] <Jevon> great
[12:08] <Jevon> But the people youre bitching to about the name arent going to care if you have facts.
[12:08] <Dommys> So it's quite possible, it's a FANTASY GAME. and this plant is a MIXTURE OF TWO PLANTS from earth.
[12:08] <Jevon> You should just let them call it what they want.
[12:08] <Dommys> Agreed. and stop jumping down everyones neck when they call it something else.

[13:29] <Dommys> One dirt, and light
[13:29] <geraldbrent> maever i have some
[13:29] <nupanick> trees don't need water, no... but think about the amount of space the leaves take up
[13:29] <Dommys> It can even be in a cave underground, so long as you provide torches
[13:29] <maever> ah did you read my question ? geraldbrent ?
[13:29] <nupanick> trees like to take up 5x5 spaces when they get big, and the 3x3 +1block spacing on all sides allows that.
[13:30] <Dommys> I usually just Dig a 10x20 and plant my trees spaced out, cut down the easy wood, burn the leaves.
[13:30] <geraldbrent> i think there may be a way ... i think
[13:30] <nupanick> as long as I don't plant two trees on adjacent plots, this seems to work find.
[13:30] <nupanick> *fine
[13:30] <Dommys> I dig it deep though, so that I can use ladders to get on top of the leaves
[13:30] <DEElekgolo> Some people just want to watch the world burn...
[13:30] <DEElekgolo> http://deelekgolo.codebrainshideout.net/Pics/2010-07-24_1330.png
[13:30] <Dommys> and "chop" through the trunk downwards
[13:30] <nupanick> my "floating farm" also has a small harbor for boating to and from it
[13:30] <maever> I get the feeling that the reason its not working.. is because the random generators spawns blocktypes that are not supported by the classic version of the game

[13:53] <ColdFusion> They do for me :(
[13:53] <bearz> iw ant submarines
[13:53] <ColdFusion> if i leave the area and then come back
[13:53] <bearz> and caeks >:I
[13:53] <bearz> submarines and cakes
[13:53] <vurtual> And everybody would be freaking out when a really loud flying thing with strange wings, a helicopter, flies down and hovers there and starts speaking ominously.
[13:53] <SireTRM> I want the ability to make 4 slime blobs=> 1 small slime to be placed at will.
[13:53] <ColdFusion> bob was gone :(
[13:53] <bearz> then the minecraft will be perfect

[13:53] <janger> who doesnt like vuvuzela's
[13:53] <SireTRM> Me.
[13:53] <ColdFusion> we need 1 more then
[13:53] <ColdFusion> thing*
[13:53] <MikkoK> SireTRM: thats a good idea :D
[13:53] <ColdFusion> a glider
[13:53] <ColdFusion> that would be awesome
[13:54] <SireTRM> Kill slimes, make pet slimes.
[13:54] <ColdFusion> maybe
[13:54] <Ivorius> Only if you kill them with fists
[13:54] <SireTRM> Then, the ability to hack-spawn mobs with inventory items!
[13:54] <Ivorius> if you kill them with weapons they die
[13:54] <Ivorius> leaving nothing
[13:55] <MikkoK> i wonder if thats thunderstorm or wind outside O.o
[13:55] <SireTRM> Look? Or check the weather radar.

[14:56] <Stealez> its what happens if you fck with the minecraft wiki too long or bitch on IRC
[14:56] <Stealez> cough
[14:56] <Snowman> ex-cav?, cav?re uithollen
[14:56] <Fiskie> png and jpg compress differently
[14:56] <blaster> So give me an example of png fucking up an image
[14:56] <Snowman> Straight from the Latin dictionary
[14:56] <SireTRM> Mildly the wrong symbol, Snowman.
[14:57] <blaster> Fiskie, well done, captain obvious
[14:57] <SireTRM> Macrons are straight.
[14:57] <Snowman> Best one I could find
[14:57] <ColdFusion> Quatroking. Also .. you are dutch ?
[14:57] <blaster> And I think PNG compress better
[14:57] <SireTRM> Not sure which key combination it is, though. . .
[14:57] <Fiskie> Derp
[14:57] <PrincepsRegulus> Why are we talking about latin?
[14:57] <Quatroking> ColdFusion, I'm Quatroking
[14:57] <PrincepsRegulus> im confused
[14:57] <SumWon> PNGs compress way better
[14:57] <Snowman> I'm too lazy to get the real one
[14:57] <Quatroking> (yes)
[14:57] <Namzo> Latina non Amo
[14:57] <Fiskie> JPG files have customizable compression
[14:57] <Quatroking> considering your shitty ISP I'd say you're dutch too
[14:57] <blaster> But APNG are by far the best
[14:58] <PrincepsRegulus> Amo latinam :D
[14:58] <geraldbrent> lol
[14:58] <Namzo> meh
[14:58] <Fiskie> The more compression, the less quality, the smaller file size
[14:58] <copyboy> wait ... "high res image of creeper face"?
[14:58] <Namzo> Princepsregulus
[14:58] <Snowman> QK lives near Rotterdam
[14:58] <Namzo> me too
[14:58] <copyboy> please tell me that's a joke

[14:58] <blaster> its not a creeper face

[15:00] <Quatroking> Yeah, I guess
[15:00] <blaster> Quatroking will we switch IRC network if this one hits 350 permenantly
[15:01] <Quatroking> just look at creepers
[15:01] <PrincepsRegulus> creeperface t-shirt?
[15:01] <sllide> Quatroking, then you live like 80Km far from me
[15:01] <Lily_White> you get wet sand that you can put onto walls and it won't fall off
[15:01] <PrincepsRegulus> i saw a pic of it
[15:01] <Quatroking> blaster: probably not
[15:01] <Stealez> I built a submarine
[15:01] <sllide> i think..
[15:01] <blaster> Because at the moment, normal traffic is 290
[15:01] <PrincepsRegulus> is it availiable yet?
[15:01] <Stealez> What should I build inside of it
[15:01] <Quatroking> sllide: Hellevoetsluis
[15:01] <blaster> and thats close to the limit
[15:01] <Quatroking> I go to school in Spijkenisse
[15:01] <blaster> So we might need to switch at some point to avoid 350 being normal traffic
[15:01] <Cial> i would like to throw them at mobs and make them stop moving

[16:33] <Flot> A giant farm in the sky making wheat and growing trees, the island itself luckily located on both clay, iron, and redstone deposits. I don't need anything else!
[16:33] <johnsprogram> methinks notch did the voices for the zombies
[16:33] <Flot> Nope, the voices are generic free-use sound effects
[16:33] <TehButter> Flot:
[16:33] <SireTRM> TehButter, the temp_chunk.dat lasts for fractions of a second and I presume it is copied into the proper chunk save folder later.
[16:33] <TehButter> How do you go about finding these deposits?
[16:33] <Flot> They were right on the island.
[16:33] <johnsprogram> so notch didn't do the cow noises too? -.-
[16:33] <TehButter> On?
[16:34] <Flot> Clay literally took up 50% of the island's surface, the other half being sand.
[16:34] <SireTRM> johnsprogram, C418 does most of the MC sounds.
[16:34] <Flot> And I found tons of iron just under the surface.
[16:34] <TehButter> I meant ore.
[16:34] <TehButter> Flot:
[16:34] <Flot> I have actually found twice as much iron as coal on this island.
[16:34] <Resetting> ive searched loads, in multiple saves, no clay yet. =/

[16:35] <vurtual> How could 278 people find reason to idle here?

[16:37] <johnsprogram> c418 is idle
[16:37] <TehButter> =\
[16:37] <Resetting> i cant find redstone. at all. So i edited it in.
[16:37] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Where is a good place to find both then flot?
[16:37] <RightLegRed> Skwerly: Yes?
[16:37] <Namzo> Whats your problem?
[16:37] <vurtual> I blame the new guys for losing some of my best friends
[16:37] <geraldbrent> When was notch last here?
[16:37] <Flot> I would go as far to say that Redstone is more common than coal, the only exception being that you only find it at the bottom of the map. But you find TONS of it.
[16:37] <Nicknam4> Imagine someone making a 4-block thick obsidian wall, only to have somebody jump over it using this -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBX_x7vSyoQ
[16:37] <Skwerly> When I log in and try to play java stops running

[16:38] <vurtual> iron is really, really common
[16:38] <geraldbrent> !blog
[16:38] <vurtual> iron should occour in huge clusters though
[16:38] <Flot> Iron is pretty common at my mine, since it's at the bottom of the map. I find a new deposit every other minute.
[16:38] <vurtual> so we can find lots of it and make a huge pit mine
[16:38] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Ok cool.

[17:50] <stone555> It's a bloody mess

[17:50] <TehButter> Minecraft is made with java :B
[17:50] <Skillkills> Quatro, Python, Perl, C++, C#

[17:50] <Skillkills> If you're looking for something easy to learn, go with python

[17:51] <stone555> Quatro what kind of programs are you wanting to make?
[17:51] <Quatroking> hell if I know
[17:51] <stone555> If it's useful ones, go with C#
[17:51] <muddtusk> SkillKills, thats what I have heard
[17:51] <Quatroking> Are there any nice "lets write a program!" tutorials regarding C++?
[17:51] <stone555> Incredibly easy and useful
[17:51] <muddtusk> I haven't programmed since HS though
[17:51] <Skillkills> hmm
[17:51] <stone555> Plus if you want to make games, you can use XNA

[17:51] <TehButter> VISUAL BASIC LOL.
[17:51] <stone555> But better
[17:51] <jabb> C# is managed, would be the main difference
[17:51] <Skillkills> Not sure about C++
[17:51] <stone555> C++ is OOP
[17:51] <SireTRM> Quatroking, C# is a higher-level programming language than java. C++ is meant to be very low-level.
[17:52] <stone555> Uhh
[17:52] <stone555> No

[17:52] <SireTRM> Lisp?
[17:52] <jabb> yeah
[17:52] <stone555> I know right
[17:52] <jabb> don't do lisp

[18:01] <stone555> (do stuff)
[18:01] <Skillkills> But there is no fucking way I'm mowing lawns
[18:01] <stone555> Why?
[18:01] <stone555> it's easy work
[18:01] <stone555> Man up
[18:01] <Skillkills> thats why there are 5 lawn services all run by mexicans.

[18:01] <Plinky> Yet you are being illogical.
[18:01] <stone555> Show the customers you will work harder
[18:01] <Skwerly> I didn't even get paid to mow the feild
[18:01] <Skillkills> No I'm not Plinky
[18:01] <stone555> Don't be a lazy moron
[18:01] <Skwerly> its not even my feild
[18:02] <Skillkills> I'm simply stating I'm not going to mow lawns like a dumbass
[18:02] <Quatroking> Skillkills, buy stuff of ebay and resell it with profit
[18:02] <Plinky> Mowing lawns is easy easy cash.
[18:02] <Quatroking> repeat and repeat
[18:02] <Quatroking> boom mony
[18:02] <stone555> Ehh
[18:02] <Skillkills> 3 hours for $30 in the hot sun

[18:02] <Skillkills> I actually have a job...
[18:02] <AndrewPH> yeah again
[18:02] <AndrewPH> :P
[18:02] <Quatroking> Thats like, what, the third day
[18:02] <stone555> So do I
[18:02] <Quatroking> AndrewPH, I did, I just want to slowly learn it :D
[18:02] <Skillkills> It's called skating every friday and saving up $10 each week
[18:02] <Jelemonde> Selling stuff on the net is, indeed, a good way of making money... We got some TV Report about a dude on TV here, in Quebec.
[18:02] <Skillkills> xD
[18:02] <Quatroking> don't want to jump into a pile of code
[18:02] <stone555> Uhh
[18:02] <Skillkills> Scamming my parents mutha fuckas

[18:03] <Plinky> if you are*
[18:03] <Skillkills> No Plinky
[18:03] <AndrewPH> Quatroking, when you want to skip ahead feel free to download it :P
[18:03] <stone555> I am lucky. I make $13 an hour at my job.
[18:03] <AndrewPH> also I suggest using IDLE or notepad++ with syntax hilighting
[18:03] <Skillkills> When I turn 15... next month, I will be working at the skating rink
[18:03] <stone555> But then again I work hard as fuck
[18:03] <AndrewPH> as python is very finicky about tabs
[18:03] <Skillkills> $8.50 an hour
[18:03] <sppt> so Quatroking how does one make money from reselling items?
[18:03] <DerSandman> So... what's everyone doing
[18:03] <Quatroking> I have notepad++ installed, its a god at stuff
[18:03] <Skillkills> 6-9 hours a day
[18:03] <Plinky> That isn't as nuch Skillkills.
[18:03] <Quatroking> sppt: buy something
[18:03] <stone555> Quatro
[18:03] <Quatroking> sell it with profit
[18:03] <Plinky> much*
[18:04] <stone555> Just use IDLE
[18:04] <Quatroking> duh
[18:04] <Quatroking> stone555 fuck no notepad+++
[18:04] <Skillkills> Plinky, But I actually have fun doing it
[18:04] <sppt> durr
[18:04] <Jelemonde> Notepad++ for Multimedia College... First program we installed in the Web Class.
[18:04] <Quatroking> I love that program
[18:04] <stone555> IDLE > Notepad++ for python
[18:04] <Skillkills> in AIR CONDITIONING
[18:04] <SireTRM> BBEdit for all code work.
[18:04] <Plinky> We are talking about cost per hour, if you mowed two laws you would get 60 dollars then.
[18:04] <stone555> Whatever floats your boat I guess, but IDLE is better.
[18:04] <Plinky> lawns*
[18:04] <Jelemonde> WHO SAID NP++ IS SHIT?!
[18:04] <SireTRM> Or emacs. That works, too.
[18:04] <stone555> No one.
[18:04] <DerSandman> Code work, heh.
[18:04] <Quatroking> sppt: for example my dad frequently buys bikes off the net and sell them with profit
[18:04] <Jelemonde> I hope so...
[18:04] <jabb> vim > emacs
[18:04] <Skwerly> I can spend an hour mowing a lawn and make 40$
[18:04] <Skillkills> Plinky
[18:04] <jabb> editor war!
[18:04] <Plinky> In othe rwords, even if you dislike it, it is better money.

[18:05] <stone555> You bitch way too much Skillkills.
[18:05] <Plinky> It would probably be less than 6 hours
[18:05] <stone555> Get used to it
[18:05] <Skillkills> then I cant mow that lawn again for a good... week-2 weeks?
[18:05] <stone555> It's the REAL WORLD.

[18:54] <Brotagonist> horizontal door, really. not even trap or hidden
[18:54] <SaiyanKirby> i think right now, one of the most helpful additions would be adding off-hand slots so you can hold lit torches that emit light, while mining
[18:54] <poke41> I still haven't.

[19:16] <poke41> How about strip mine,
[19:16] <Outpost> I can't play it muchly until Notch fixes slimes.
[19:16] <poke41> Don't get raped by slimes.
[19:16] <zerocool> just go on peaceful
[19:16] <Pelum> it was an elaberate plan involving pulleys and a lure
[19:16] <Nerdy> I went into a cave and saw about 50+ slime. No creepers, Zombies, or skeletions
[19:16] <zerocool> and build, then switch when it is fixed
[19:17] <poke41> Zerocool.
[19:17] <Outpost> Zero: Slimes spawn on peaceful.

[19:17] <Visiiri> They don't do damage, do they?
[19:17] <Jevon> So
[19:17] <zerocool> indeed buggy then
[19:17] <Nerdy> Yes they so
[19:17] <poke41> They do.
[19:17] <Nerdy> do*
[19:17] <Visiiri> :(
[19:17] <Kratospie> The smallest ones don't
[19:17] <Kratospie> I think
[19:17] <Visiiri> That's too bad
[19:17] <Outpost> Zero: They also spawn in lit areas of caves, can no clip, and can perma-stun you to death.
[19:17] <Jevon> They dont damage you enoguh to be a threat on peaceful
[19:17] <Kratospie> yeah
[19:17] <Kratospie> instant respawn
[19:17] <poke41> But.
[19:17] <zerocool> yea but destroys the point of peaceful
[19:17] <Kratospie> Of health
[19:17] <poke41> The damage collision is buggy.

[19:17] <Visiiri> I've got some shirts here
[19:18] <poke41> Long-distance damage.
[19:18] <Visiiri> I want you to tell me what you think
[19:18] <TrueWolves> I love how people constantly complaign about the rules, yet when ever you enter ANY place that doesn't have rules and hasn't for a long time, it's usualy a complete pit of idiot jabber with almost no simulerity to what it once was.
[19:18] <Nerdy> A slime hit me through a wall. Actually it was 5 of them
[19:18] <Jevon> Much like this chatroom

[19:18] <Kratospie> show us
[19:18] <Visiiri> TrueWolves: Ex: Facepunch
[19:18] <TrueWolves> I wonder what would happen if the "oppresive ops" accualy inforced the minecraft only topic rule.

[19:18] <Dommys> What rules, True?
[19:18] <Dommys> Oh, that rule?

[19:18] <Nerdy> Visiiri what is wrong with FP?
[19:18] <Visiiri> Tell me what you think of both of them
[19:18] <TrueWolves> I'm tempted to get permission to enforce that rule for 1 week to see what happens.
[19:18] <Kratospie> Visirri
[19:18] <Visiiri> I've ordered them- the second in six colors
[19:18] <Dommys> DO IT
[19:19] <zerocool> mass decline in idling
[19:19] <Brotagonist> DO EEET
[19:19] <zerocool> err.
[19:19] <TrueWolves> Then you all can see what a REAL oppresive channel is.
[19:19] <zerocool> mass incline in idling
[19:19] <Kratospie> Make a creeper one that says "WHAT THE SHIT?!"

[19:19] <Jevon> Ill get raped thanks
[19:19] <Kratospie> your not an op
[19:20] <Jevon> SO ABOUT THAT BACON
[19:20] <Kratospie> there we go
[19:20] <Kratospie> thats better
[19:20] <Nerdy> O god
[19:20] <Visiiri> Sweet, now I can actually TALK here.
[19:20] <Dommys> My favorite thing about minecraft : Mining.
[19:20] <Dommys> Go figure, right?
[19:20] <Kitoari> really now
[19:20] <Kratospie> Do Visiiri's shirts count as minecraft
[19:20] <geraldbrent> minecraft is buggy right now even in alpha
[19:20] <Brotagonist> Second favorite?
[19:20] <Visiiri> however, do my minecraft shirts count as minecraft?
[19:20] <poke41> Mining is good in Minecraft.
[19:20] <TrueWolves> Yeah the shirt can count.
[19:20] <Visiiri> Sure they do.
[19:20] <wolf_alex> god I love my place
[19:20] <Jevon> I like building more than mining

[19:20] <Visiiri> So, uhm
[19:20] <poke41> I mine.
[19:20] <Kratospie> gerald, its ALPHA, of course its buggy
[19:20] <Nerdy> I want SMP. When the hell is that coming out
[19:20] <Visiiri> Can I have a bit more feedback?
[19:20] <poke41> Then I mine some more.
[19:20] <Dommys> Third: is getting raped by adorable slimes.
[19:20] <Jevon> The actual process of mining is pretty boring
[19:20] <Kratospie> I can't wait till Beta Creative
[19:20] <Kratospie> its gonna be so fun
[19:20] <Dommys> Fourth : Not knowing what to use redstone for
[19:20] <geraldbrent> ikno but latest update is buggy as ever

[19:21] <zerocool> track shirt is nice.
[19:21] <Visiiri> Honestly, what do you guys think of them D:
[19:21] <Outpost> Is talking about #minecraft itself talking about minecraft?
[19:21] <Dommys> Fifth : Modding my save with INVedit, and then loosing interest.
[19:21] <Visiiri> Would you order them?
[19:21] <Outpost> Or is that too meta?
[19:21] <areagle> Dommys redstone is not to hard to use once you read minepedia
[19:21] <Kratospie> Visiiri, make a creeper shirt that has "WHAT THE SHIT" on it
[19:21] <Kratospie> I would buy it
[19:21] <Jevon> Visiiri: that diamon shirt is pretty cash
[19:21] <Visiiri> Kratospie: I cannot do that.
[19:21] <TrueWolves> I like the diamond shirt a lot better.
[19:21] <Nerdy> The diamond one looks cool.
[19:21] <poke41> Okay.
[19:21] <Visiiri> Shit is a bad word.
[19:21] <Kratospie> aww
[19:21] <Visiiri> Yeah, I do too
[19:21] <Dommys> Areagle, I understand basic wiring and such.. I just don't see a point
[19:21] <zerocool> diamond shirt looks too surreal to me
[19:21] <Visiiri> I just spent hours working on making text out of the track
[19:21] <poke41> I'm leaving because of stomach problems now... :(
[19:21] <Kratospie> diamond one looks awesome
[19:21] <Nerdy> Make a pink pig shirt.
[19:21] <areagle> You can open doors using the redstone

[19:22] <Jevon> Visiiri: where do I get one! >:C
[19:22] <Dommys> Poke is a liar. They are leaving because they don't want to talk about minecraft,
[19:22] <areagle> to make sure mobs dont get in
[19:22] <Dommys> Can mobs open doors?
[19:22] <areagle> no
[19:22] <Nahob> ``zzzzz'
[19:22] <Visiiri> Jevon: Not sure yet :D
[19:22] <Dommys> Then right clicking a door is faster than wiring it.
[19:22] <Visiiri> This is my idea for a sheep: http://img828.imageshack.us/img828/3646/sheepbackground.jpg
[19:22] <Jevon> they can shoot through them though, dommy
[19:22] <Kitoari> dommys: they'll be able to open wooden doors in THE FUTURE
[19:22] <Kratospie> Redstone doesn't seem very useful, considering that most complex designs that require it are to resorce heavy
[19:22] <Cial> take the design to an airbrush artist and have it special ordered?
[19:22] <areagle> Well its actually a left click :)
[19:22] <Nerdy> Sheep should be on fire :D
[19:22] <Kratospie> You can just make a stone button
[19:22] <Visiiri> Solution: Don't go outside.
[19:22] <Cial> Dommys, no
[19:23] <Kratospie> place it next to the door
[19:23] <Brotagonist> so where can I order that diamond shirt at?
[19:23] <Kratospie> it will close when you walk through it
[19:23] <Kratospie> simple
[19:23] <Visiiri> Brotagonist: rofl, you cannot yet order it
[19:23] <Kratospie> :D
[19:23] <Jevon> Shirt idea, My other car is a Pig with a saddle.
[19:23] <Visiiri> You guys have made me happy
[19:23] <AndrewPH> Kratospie, or you could make it open every door in your base with the use of one button
[19:23] <areagle> Or you can make a light which turns on when a mob walk over a certain pressure plate
[19:23] <Visiiri> I think I'll email Notch

[19:24] <Kratospie> so unless I went all the way to the edge for new make to spawn

[19:24] <LunaticGhost> Ooooooh...
[19:24] <LunaticGhost> Thanks a lot ^^'

[19:27] <Dommys> But the typical shortbow, meh. Have fun trying to take down medium game with that
[19:27] <Kitoari> mining harder than killing a skele?
[19:27] <areagle> Nerdy you could trap him with redstone wires
[19:27] <Kitoari> ahahahaha
[19:27] <Kitoari> yeah right.

[19:28] <Kratospie> I have no idea how SMP would work
[19:28] <TrueWolves> About the right strength even.
[19:28] <Kitoari> you can also use bows for arrow traps
[19:28] <Kratospie> A diamond sword would be a two hit kill on all players?
[19:28] <Kratospie> That seems to strong
[19:28] <Kitoari> (tnt arrow traps, that is)
[19:28] <Kratospie> *too
[19:28] <TrueWolves> it would two-hit anyone with out armor.
[19:29] <Einherjar> I think weapons should have higher durability
[19:29] <Kratospie> Ok
[19:29] <areagle> They can eat too
[19:29] <Kitoari> but less power, I hope?
[19:29] <LunaticGhost> it's not like diamond is an easy find anyway... Well... it is durable.

[19:29] <Kitoari> 1000 uses
[19:29] <Jevon> that guy is pretty cool
[19:29] <Kitoari> no more diamond durability plz?
[19:29] <Jevon> the binary redstone thing

[19:29] <Kratospie> If SMP is only co-op
[19:29] <Dommys> Steal diamond sword.
[19:29] <Kratospie> I will laugh
[19:29] <Kratospie> so
[19:29] <Kratospie> hard
[19:29] <Dommys> Get killed for diamond sword.
[19:29] <Dommys> Cry.
[19:29] <Kratospie> Fourms would have constant rage
[19:29] <areagle> Ask Quatroking :p
[19:29] <Einherjar> Yeah, but considering how many hits one monster tanks before it dies, a diamond sword expires far faster than it should IMO

[20:03] <Whaleboobs> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3GJgLCHrkY gotta love the comment

[20:07] <Shrub> I want that mob to be real

[20:10] <ouT|Phaze> (might as well be specific)
[20:10] <RoosterAlpha> Like bowl
[20:10] <Tukiko> minecraft without corners

[20:10] <ouT|Phaze> iron
[20:10] <ouT|Phaze> kk
[20:10] <areagle> but with iron ingots
[20:10] <ouT|Phaze> so like boat?
[20:10] <areagle> no
[20:10] <Visiiri> Minecraft without corners rofl
[20:10] <Tukiko> sgsuigb Minecart without corners.
[20:10] <RoosterAlpha> No
[20:11] <areagle> top left, top right, center
[20:11] <Visiiri> that would be spheres instead of cubes
[20:11] <ouT|Phaze> I don't know how to make a bowl
[20:11] <Visiiri> and would be quite the game

[20:15] <Rooster_Derpz> I can't wait for SMP, everyone will be disapointed there stupid traps didn't work.
[20:15] <Avo> Yoshibear, thats how its usually handled
[20:15] <cynicalAlchemist> Yup, once SMP comes out, there will be a set setting for the server and nothing nobody can do about it.
[20:16] <JabJabJab> lol and i made this this morning http://i559.photobucket.com/albums/ss31/XDreamersMS/MineCraft/MineCraft%203D%20Toolkit/Untitled.gif
[20:16] <Malarkey> smp build server? might as well play classic
[20:16] <Avo> Whats the difference between that and creative mode sire?
[20:16] <SireTRM> Make epic things with work.
[20:16] <Inside> flying, etc
[20:16] <Kitoari> won't there be alpha creative
[20:16] <Inside> fall damage, etc.
[20:16] <Yoshibear1009> Collecting the items?
[20:16] <Yoshibear1009> Teamwork?
[20:16] <SireTRM> Teamwork.
[20:16] <Yoshibear1009> More difficult griefing?
[20:16] <Inside> shit, I don't think that I'd play MCS if there's a MCAC...
[20:16] <Inside> 0_o!

[20:17] <Kitoari> redstone puzzles? probably not
[20:17] <Yoshibear1009> Almost every trap.....
[20:17] <Kamila> my SMP server will be: I don't care what you gonna do, but if server crash, the world will be reset-ed
[20:17] <Rooster_Derpz> But everyone assumes that they will be the best as the game.
[20:17] <Avo> Personally, i think obsidian is going to be one of the most valued blocks in multiplayer. Nothing will stop an advancing army as well as an obsidian wall with a lip.

[20:17] <areagle> I still think the single 1x1 whole all the way down to the bottom of the map topped off with a pressure plate, sand, and TNT will work
[20:18] <Rooster_Derpz> Quite frankly, Quatro is a poophead
[20:18] <Yoshibear1009> Uhh... lips are quite easy to get over... if you see the shadow
[20:18] <Kitoari> like my collapsible fort

[20:18] <Rooster_Derpz> How fucking original
[20:18] <Visiiri> You don't have to DO something to be epic
[20:18] <Visiiri> He's just epic.
[20:18] <areagle> not if you apply the pressure plate as some guy is chasing you

[20:19] <Rooster_Derpz> redstone
[20:19] <Vis{TF2}> Notch named it.
[20:19] <Skillkills> Redstone....

[20:22] <Kratospie> And that
[20:22] <Skillkills> Penises as every block
[20:23] <Kratospie> Yeah
[20:23] <Conundrumer> how much space between saplings for tree farms?
[20:23] <Kitoari> but then we have the opposite problem
[20:23] <Kitoari> people with invisible dirt
[20:23] <Kratospie> You can't do much about that
[20:23] <Kratospie> even then
[20:23] <Kratospie> it would just make it harder for them
[20:23] <Skillkills> I prefer invisible stone
[20:23] <Skillkills> lmao
[20:23] <Rooster_Derpz> Couldn't Notch just make textures non transparent? like with skins?
[20:24] <Kratospie> Rooster
[20:24] <Kitoari> that could work
[20:24] <Kratospie> How would Glass work
[20:24] <tssguy123> Conundrumer - 2 spaces in each direction
[20:24] <Kitoari> just mark glass/leaves as exceptions
[20:24] <Skillkills> I guess he could make it check if the alpha is 0, make it black
[20:24] <Kratospie> Glass?
[20:24] <Rooster_Derpz> He can limit it to every block by glass and leaves
[20:24] <tssguy123> --sapling--
[20:24] <Rooster_Derpz> *but
[20:24] <tssguy123> same for above and below
[20:24] <Kratospie> People could just make it semi transparent

[20:28] <Kratospie> I still don't like it
[20:29] <yoshibear> O.O
[20:29] <Kratospie> some servers would make every block a penis
[20:29] <Kitoari> and that's perfectly fine
[20:29] <Kratospie> :l
[20:29] <Kitoari> @ first line
[20:29] <yoshibear> Just dont join those servers

[20:29] <Kratospie> As long as there would be a choice
[20:29] <Kratospie> it would be fine

[20:29] <Kratospie> Kitoari
[20:29] <Skillkills> xD
[20:29] <Kratospie> Server side textures would be a nice option
[20:30] <Kratospie> but not everyone would like it
[20:30] <yoshibear> But then the invisiblocks texture would be easily posible if its choosable.. for the player
[20:30] <Skillkills> Well
[20:30] <SireTRM> Choice can defeat the purpose. Forced server-side textures prevents things like clear blocks.
[20:30] <Kratospie> and lots of people would want to use there own skin
[20:30] <Kratospie> I'm thinking about creative servers
[20:30] <Kratospie> not SMP servers
[20:30] <Rooster_Derpz> like sv_pure in source games
[20:30] <Skillkills> If you go into a server with every block as a penis.... LEAVE.. The admin there is a dumbass anyways
[20:30] <yoshibear> There will be non-forced servers I bet...
[20:30] <ouT|Phaze> http://goo.gl/mod/82Ez
[20:30] <Kitoari> I'm thinking about smp servers
[20:30] <yoshibear> lol
[20:30] <ouT|Phaze> :3
[20:30] <Kitoari> I don't see the major diff. though
[20:30] <Kratospie> I want an option to use my own skin though :/
[20:30] <Kitoari> for creative, textures are no big deal
[20:30] <Kratospie> I like my skin better than any others I have seen
[20:30] <Skillkills> YOU DO
[20:30] <Rooster_Derpz> Minecraft should have some console commands from Source.
[20:31] <Kratospie> no
[20:31] <Kratospie> just
[20:31] <Kratospie> no
[20:31] <Kitoari> but for survival invis. would be a bigger problem
[20:31] <Inside> yeah, a console would be nice.
[20:31] <Skillkills> The option to use the server texture, or yours
[20:31] <yoshibear> lol
[20:31] <Kratospie> I would want an option
[20:31] <Skillkills> You have the ability to SWITCH
[20:31] <Skillkills> YES
[20:31] <Skillkills> THATS WHAT IM SAYING
[20:31] <yoshibear> That would kill the WHOLE POINT
[20:31] <Kratospie> I know
[20:31] <EmpiresBane> maybe the server could choose if you could choose
[20:31] <Kratospie> But others say it would kill the whole point
[20:31] <Kratospie> :/
[20:31] <TrueWolves> I use CAPSLOCK for unnessary EMPHISIS
[20:31] <Skillkills> Esc- Options - Texture 1: Server texture 2: custom texture
[20:31] <Kratospie> Empries bain
[20:31] <Kratospie> Yes
[20:32] <yoshibear> lol
[20:32] <Rooster_Derpz> capslock = EXTREME EMOTION
[20:32] <yoshibear> I ripped my caps-lock key out, I only use shift :p
[20:32] <Skillkills> No empire
[20:32] <Hy\sleep\t> SHIFT > CAPS LOCK
[20:32] <Kitoari> skillkills: I've said it on- on, 5000 times
[20:32] <TrueWolves> Someone brought up to me that caps lock isn't always the best thing to kick for
[20:32] <Kitoari> and I'll say it again
[20:32] <SireTRM> Running 2 textures would also mess up entity placement on objects like torches. . .
[20:32] <Kitoari> that. defeats. the whole. point.
[20:32] <TrueWolves> so now I'll only kick if you use it for stupid things, like random spam bs.
[20:32] <Skillkills> Cuz then everyone who makes a penis texture, would make it so you HAVE to use the server texture
[20:32] <Shrub> Hy\sleep\t sure does have it correct.
[20:33] <Rooster_Derpz> So I can talk in caps all I want?
[20:33] <Skillkills> You know what.... Server textures... That's it.
[20:33] <tssguy123> Typing Like This Is Much Worse Than Caps Lock >.>
[20:33] <EmpiresBane> Skillkills, then go to a different server
[20:33] <SireTRM> Skillkills, then you go away because the server is troll.
[20:33] <Skillkills> If you don't like the texture, leave the server
[20:33] <Kitoari> people who would use invis. textures > people who would make penis servers
[20:33] <yoshibear> But I Love To Type Like This...

[20:33] <Shrub> Mibbit's better than Mac.

[20:34] <Rooster_Derpz> I think the problem with "just leave the server" is that there are only like 300 people on at one time.
[20:34] <SireTRM> Or reskin and put windows in everything.
[20:34] <Rooster_Derpz> So there won't be very many active servers.
[20:34] <Rooster_Derpz> That meet your criteria
[20:34] <Rooster_Derpz> brb
[20:34] <Shrub> There will be.

[20:35] * SireTRM (chatzilla@rrcs-72-43-58-182.nys.biz.rr.com) has left #minecraft
[20:35] <Kitoari> rooster: or another idea, somehow force all servers to include the default
[20:35] <yoshibear> I personally like either servers with people I 'know' in them or 2-13 people servers
[20:35] <Kitoari> so if people don't like the custom, they can use default at least
[20:35] <yoshibear> Yeah, that would work.....
[20:36] <Kitoari> the only problem would be making it so server owners couldn't change the default texture
[20:36] <yoshibear> Hmn.....
[20:36] <EmpiresBane> what?
[20:36] <EmpiresBane> how could they?
[20:36] <EmpiresBane> Kitoari, no
[20:36] <Kitoari> "no"? no to what?
[20:36] <EmpiresBane> the defualt is saved to the client...
[20:36] <yoshibear> It would be easy to change the default

[20:37] <yoshibear> Unless notch implements something to check the texture
[20:37] <Kitoari> that's the main problem with client side textures!
[20:37] <EmpiresBane> you guys do realize it will be impossible to stop texture changes
[20:37] <Kitoari> it ruins security and hiding things
[20:37] <EmpiresBane> even if the server sends it, it's still easy to change
[20:38] <yoshibear> And can make things seem easier to see such as pressure plates on smooth stone....
[20:38] <Kamila> make it 'pure server' setting available
[20:38] <EmpiresBane> make a quick wrapper to block the servers texture and load your own

[20:38] <Kratospie> Stupid lag
[20:38] <Skillkills> it truly is impossible
[20:38] <Skillkills> even if the server sends it
[20:38] <Skillkills> I can mod my client to use my own texture
[20:39] <Kitoari> nirvana fallacy get?
[20:39] <Kratospie> yeah.
[20:39] <EmpiresBane> that's what i just said, Skillkills
[20:39] <Kamila> worst come to worst, hide your base on the other side of the world
[20:39] <Skillkills> Oh I didnt even see
[20:39] <EmpiresBane> you don't even need to change the client itself
[20:39] <Kratospie> So is no clipping dead pretty much? Notch said the server checks if your in a block
[20:39] <yoshibear> Yay, no noclip ^^
[20:39] <Shrub> :D
[20:39] <Kitoari> "Because no solution is perfect, we shouldn't bother with any of them."
[20:39] <Skillkills> Not entirely
[20:39] <Kitoari> except not
[20:40] <Kamila> noclip should be optional to the server, imo
[20:40] <Kratospie> Meh
[20:40] <Shrub> Yeah.
[20:40] <Skillkills> I know a way to no clip even with that kind of check
[20:40] <Kratospie> Hacks in survival seem dumb
[20:40] <Kitoari> skillkills: ooh, now release it for the griefers
[20:40] <Kitoari> except wait
[20:40] <Kratospie> Maybe in creative
[20:40] <Kitoari> that's bad
[20:40] <Kitoari> @_@
[20:40] <Skillkills> I know
[20:40] <Kratospie> But not in Survial
[20:40] <yoshibear> What griefers will do to be an a**hole...

[20:40] <Kitoari> gotta agree with krato here
[20:40] <areagle> I figured out a way to make a nearly impossible to find base:
[20:40] <Skillkills> I can tell you how to do it, though
[20:40] <Einherjar> The server admins should be able to noclip, IMO
[20:40] <Einherjar> :\
[20:40] <EmpiresBane> then play on a private server
[20:40] <Kitoari> hacks + survival = dumb
[20:41] <areagle> simply dig a straight hole down 50 or so block which leads to your base
[20:41] <Skillkills> >dig staight down
[20:41] <Skillkills> BAD IDEA
[20:41] <Skillkills> Anyways
[20:41] <Skillkills> Make it so that when you press a button,
[20:41] <Shrub> you die
[20:41] <areagle> then when you want to enter place a water source at the top, get inside, and fall down
[20:41] <Skillkills> it sends your current position to the server
[20:41] * Prime_Intellect (Prime_Inte@pool-74-96-163-37.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:41] <areagle> you have to listen to the rest :)
[20:41] <yoshibear> Only works if there in no invisa-tex
[20:41] <areagle> invisa-tex?
[20:41] <Einherjar> digging a hole straight down is a real bad idea
[20:41] <Skillkills> but you can keep moving in your client while sending that position
[20:42] <yoshibear> I would still wander away for 20 mins before doing that
[20:42] <Jevoon> I have a better way which is similar
[20:42] * Golden (Mibbit@ip72-193-89-211.lv.lv.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:42] <yoshibear> invisi-tex*
[20:42] <Kitoari> anyways, another thing:
[20:42] <Skillkills> Ima make this one big text
[20:42] <Skillkills> xD
[20:42] <Kratospie> I make all of my Single Player Survival Bases out of wood :P
[20:42] <areagle> Why einherjar?
[20:42] <Jevoon> Build your base under the sea, and ladder the water so it cant fall in
[20:42] <Kitoari> my decoy tnt/chest ideas don't need different textures
[20:42] <EmpiresBane> Skillkills, the server can check for large jumps
[20:42] <Kitoari> so you can't mod one without modding the other
[20:42] <Kratospie> but
[20:42] <yoshibear> That would suck if someone brought fire O.O (@Krat)
[20:42] <Kratospie> Right click doesnt start TNT
[20:42] <Kratospie> Again
[20:42] <Kratospie> Its in Single Player Survial
[20:42] <Kratospie> so it doesnt matter
[20:42] <Kratospie> :P
[20:43] <Einherjar> Areagle: Because you could hit lava
[20:43] <Kitoari> but this is for when multi comes out
[20:43] <Skillkills> Make it so that when you press a button, it stores your position and sends it to the server, Making it think you're staying there... BUT, You're actually moving around through the world while the client sends the stored pos to the server. Once you release the key it will update the server with you're current position
[20:43] <Einherjar> or also slimes, what with their current ability to hit you through blocks
[20:43] <Kitoari> and people need actual security
[20:43] <Skillkills> Thats how to do the no clip
[20:43] <EmpiresBane> <EmpiresBane> Skillkills, the server can check for large jumps
[20:43] <ouT|Phaze> LOL, and now my friend is testing the BPM of a bunch of sizes of clocks
[20:43] <ouT|Phaze> man, I'm scared to see his SMP mazes when they come out
[20:43] * Earfolds (ookami@host86-129-100-151.range86-129.btcentralplus.com) has joined #minecraft
[20:43] <EmpiresBane> also, you won't get the chunks around you sent to you
[20:43] <Skillkills> So make the client send small jumps to the server
[20:44] <yoshibear> It will be really fun at least (@ouT)
[20:44] <EmpiresBane> through rocks?
[20:44] <areagle> Einherjar you only have to do it once, do it a minute after starting the game and getting a wooden pick
[20:44] <EmpiresBane> that's what movement is
[20:44] <EmpiresBane> a bunch of small jumps
[20:44] <Skillkills> His work around wotn fully work
[20:44] <Kitoari> also, krato
[20:44] <Skillkills> Cuz when you're in a block, it slowly kills you
[20:44] <Skillkills> I'm sure he will keep it like that
[20:44] <Kitoari> I imagine right clicking a chest executes a function like "OpenChest(id)"
[20:45] <Skillkills> instead of kicking you if you get trapped in a block
[20:45] <Kitoari> so (hopefully) it could be changed
[20:45] <Kratospie> Well yeah
[20:45] <EmpiresBane> if you change positions to inside another block it could kick you
[20:45] <EmpiresBane> no-clip is real easy to stop
[20:45] <Kratospie> but I'm not talking about custom servers
[20:45] <Skillkills> Empire, what if you walk under falling sand
[20:45] <Skillkills> kick?
[20:45] <Kratospie> I'm talking about the vanilla one
[20:45] <Skillkills> I think not.
[20:46] <EmpiresBane> ...
[20:46] <Kratospie> Sand kills you
[20:46] <EmpiresBane> sand isn't a block until it's stopped
[20:46] <Jevoon> I reckon there will be wurm-style town tokens, only smaller. So all will be good
[20:46] <yoshibear> I dont know why, but now I want to make a base which is lined with TNT.. and have a sign with a button connected to TNT under it that says 'Self Destruct Button'... :p
[20:46] <EmpiresBane> so no
[20:46] <Skillkills> yes, but it stops and it kills you
[20:46] * Kokopure is now known as Koko|Oyasumi
[20:46] <Koko|Oyasumi> gotta wander off to bed now
[20:46] <EmpiresBane> oh my god...
[20:46] <Skillkills> Ok then... what if you lag, and the client cant send info to the server
[20:46] <yoshibear> Bye koko
[20:46] <Koko|Oyasumi> mom's throwing a fit -__-
[20:46] <Kratospie> Then you lag
[20:46] <Skillkills> you would look like you are jumping around
[20:46] <Skillkills> kick?
[20:46] <Kratospie> yeah
[20:47] <EmpiresBane> then check for it multiple times
[20:47] <Kratospie> why not
[20:47] <Kamila> dead man switch ftw
[20:47] <Kratospie> :P
[20:47] <yoshibear> I have major internet problems though :'(
[20:47] <Kamila> one you're on top of the trigger, you cannot go anywhere
[20:47] <EmpiresBane> deal with it. no-clip is easy to stop
[20:47] <EmpiresBane> i gtg
[20:47] <Skillkills> Krat, cuz then you would get kicked for just playing
[20:47] <yoshibear> bye emp
[20:47] <Kratospie> yeah
[20:47] <Kratospie> wouldnt that be fun
[20:47] <Kratospie> Its like

[20:50] <Outpost> Hyst: It wasn't my first night.
[20:50] <sorre> something strange happened last time my staircase ran afoul of a creeper
[20:50] <Kratospie> Slimes are awesome
[20:50] <Outpost> Yeah, but it makes things infinitely easier in creative mode, TW>
[20:50] <Kratospie> I don't care what anyone says
[20:50] <Skillkills> Yes Truewolves, But you're incredily slow without them
[20:50] <Outpost> Much in the same way /cuboid and the like does.
[20:50] <Kratospie> Slimes are the best mobs ever
[20:51] <Hyst> ok, out.
[20:51] <areagle> Has anyone else tried replicating minecraft in flash?
[20:51] <TrueWolves> Pfft, slow?
[20:51] <Jevoon> why not just ban noclippers on sight?
[20:51] <Skillkills> Yes, slow
[20:51] <TrueWolves> That's just inexperince.
[20:51] <sorre> i killed the creeper right as it exploded, and it only destroyed one block
[20:51] <sorre> the one it was standing directly on
[20:51] <yoshibear> I would lol if someone made a fly that when you get 20+ blocks above ground, it auto-closes itself :p
[20:51] <Skillkills> I've been playing since may 20th 2009... Inexperience?
[20:51] <Kratospie> I always build normaly
[20:51] <TrueWolves> The only thing slow is your walking speed, building speed wise I can build quite fast.
[20:51] <vurtual> no, really, what do slimes do exactly?
[20:51] <Kratospie> I build a huge Opblock spleef arena
[20:51] <Skillkills> exactly truewolves
[20:51] <Kratospie> Without hacks
[20:51] <Outpost> Building speed wise TW, I can build a whole lot FASTER than quite-fast.
[20:51] <TrueWolves> you have grown to rely on hax, rather then build up how decent you are with out them.
[20:51] <Kratospie> took me a couple minutes
[20:52] <yoshibear> I build HUUUGGGEEE sprites without hacks...

[21:05] <Lutin> Vanilla means untouched
[21:05] <yoshibear> Vanilla meaning using only the resources available
[21:05] <Lutin> Default
[21:05] <Tukiko> Vanilla is delicious.
[21:05] <Outpost> Vanilla Warcraft 3 for instance would be Warcraft 3 without expansions.
[21:05] <yoshibear> so yeah... similar...
[21:05] <Outpost> Or Vanilla TF2 is TF2 without any mods.
[21:05] <yoshibear> Vanilla SMW hacking ^^
[21:05] <Lutin> Or Vanilla Boobs are boobs without any mods

[21:05] <yoshibear> LOL
[21:05] <Lutin> Or wait, is that a racist comment

[21:06] <yoshibear> Sure.....
[21:06] <vurtual> I finally gathered up some resources, knowing I'd never reach my base at any speed
[21:06] <Tukiko> Does it have a link to Soviet 's world?

[21:07] <Tukiko> Double negatives to not work on me.
[21:07] <yoshibear> wait.... @Kamalia's link to Electic de Chocobo.. Harvest Moon/Rune Factory @ 0:40?
[21:07] <Skorchy> Didnt think the skin would bleed that bad.
[21:07] <Skorchy> I tried to use a knife to cut the dirt out

[21:08] <Skorchy> I didn't even push that hard, just kinda barely cut the skin.
[21:08] <Kratospie> No
[21:08] <yoshibear> I do not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not unlike this song...
[21:08] <Kratospie> not till Beta
[21:08] <Kratospie> I can't wait though
[21:08] <yoshibear> I dont even know what I just said :p
[21:08] <Tukiko> Then it's still not even worth playing (for me). :[
[21:08] <Skorchy> Tuki, because we need to give everyone working TNT?
[21:08] <Soviet_1> nothing like digging the spawn area so that people die upon spawning
[21:09] <Kratospie> TNT is already just a decoration
[21:09] <Skorchy> WORKING TNT.
[21:09] <Kratospie> in creative
[21:09] <Tukiko> Skorchy: Because we need redstone and minecarts

[21:09] <Tukiko> Why spend the time to get all of the resources in alpha when you get relatively infinite resources in creative?

[21:19] <Tukiko> Little thing you can cut skin with
[21:19] <yoshibear> Vinegar*
[21:20] <Skorchy> Vineger+cut= nooooooo
[21:20] <Tukiko> "a surgical knife with a pointed double-edged blade; used for punctures and small incisions"
[21:20] <yoshibear> lol
[21:20] <yoshibear> It sterilizes it though....
[21:20] <Tukiko> You can buy them in boxes of like 100 at a pharmacy
[21:20] <Skorchy> Alcohol + cut Fuck nooooooooooo
[21:20] <Tukiko> Make sure to get some bbq sauce to sterilize
[21:20] <yoshibear> lol
[21:21] <Skorchy> Some guy thought SALT was a sterilizer.
[21:21] <yoshibear> Doesnt it kill the germs?
[21:21] <Skorchy> You have fun with that...
[21:21] <Skorchy> Idk
[21:21] <Soviet> Tukiko, http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?ae8g74skf438r92

[21:22] <Skorchy> Uhm.
[21:22] <Skorchy> The obvious choice would be a lil bit of pain.

[21:25] <Tukiko> CyanRyan: You will be when SMP comes out.
[21:25] <Soviet_1> there should be one circular /glass library right on top of the sphere

[21:40] <LordAidan> Hey Lucifer
[21:40] <LuciferZ> So it's bamboo that I'm referring to. It drops papyrus. For weird reasons
[21:40] <yoshibear> Nope
[21:40] <LuciferZ> Hey Aidan.
[21:41] <LordAidan> Notch needs to add stupid writing on the paper.
[21:41] <yoshibear> Just because papyrus LOOKS like bamboo IRL
[21:41] <pocketprobe> So we can make books?
[21:41] <LordAidan> Maybe this is

[21:42] <LuciferZ> We know what the fuck papyrus is, Yoshibear
[21:42] <LordAidan> and skeletons that materialise arrows
[21:42] <LordAidan> It's bamboo paper.
[21:42] <pocketprobe> If we could write on the papyrus... We could make books and send bulk messages and shit.

[21:46] <pocketprobe> Do you have working glx

[21:47] <csc> upgraded the ram to 1g, set shared vram to 128mb, 1.8GHz sempron processor
[21:47] <yoshibear> Lol, every 3 seconds?
[21:47] <Visiiri> 1g ram rofl
[21:47] <Visiiri> That's probably why
[21:47] <Visiiri> 'upgraded' to 1g
[21:47] <Visiiri> that's funny
[21:47] <yoshibear> I have 512 megs...
[21:48] <csc> minecraft only uses up to 500 mb of ram
[21:48] <csc> why shouldnt 1 gig be sufficient
[21:48] <csc> and the refurb came with 256
[21:48] <yoshibear> Well, in the client....
[21:48] <SumWon> [21:46:37] <yoshibear> MIne is 6 years old and it only lags every 15 frames ^^
[21:48] <Visiiri> No, not because of ram

[21:48] <KodaichiZerq> okay guys

[22:17] <DatOneGuy> They saved me from the tyranny that was gamestop
[22:17] <yoshibear> Light it up?
[22:17] <yoshibear> Lol
[22:17] <DerSandman> My first base is compeletly over-run with slimes.
[22:18] <SpaceManiac> NASA has 479,767
[22:18] <yoshibear> A suggestion on the forums
[22:18] <DatOneGuy> since the world is so big, are the chances of me finding hte perfect area pretty good, or should I jsut settle somewhere?
[22:18] <yoshibear> ..... People have problems
[22:18] <yoshibear> Uhh...
[22:18] <yoshibear> Depends on what you think is perfect
[22:19] <pocketprobe> csc, Strange. It sounds like a video issue now
[22:19] <DatOneGuy> Has plenty of the things I'd like around, and a decent looking area?
[22:19] <yoshibear> My view of perfect is a slightly large cave, not too large though
[22:19] <yoshibear> with an epic cave right near that
[22:19] <pocketprobe> CPU is strong enough for creative
[22:19] <yoshibear> Surprisingly, there are alot of those
[22:19] <DerSandman> Uploading photos on this seems to be botched too.
[22:19] <DatOneGuy> I do have a huge ocean here with a cool cave neqra it
[22:19] <DatOneGuy> Might just take that
[22:19] <DerSandman> Mine get stuck @ 19%.
[22:19] <DatOneGuy> I could always hollow out the mountain to live in I suppose
[22:19] <Randomnation> You can create the perfect area.
[22:19] <Skorchy> I keep lagging on minecraft
[22:19] <yoshibear> hmn... im bleeding...
[22:19] <Randomnation> YOU HAVE THE TOOLS.
[22:19] <Skorchy> IDK why
[22:19] <Kitoari> hollowed mountains are great
[22:20] <DatOneGuy> Is diamond/obsidian so rare that I may have to walk several maps to find it?
[22:20] <Kitoari> since it doubles as a mine
[22:20] <DerSandman> Hollowed mountain is what my base is, slimes spawn in it.
[22:20] <Randomnation> No.
[22:20] <Kitoari> obsidian can be made
[22:20] <Randomnation> It's just deep
[22:20] <yoshibear> Obsidian - No Diamond - Maybe
[22:20] <csc> pocketprobe, doesn't give me any clue on how to fix it
[22:20] <Skorchy> I have 8GB of ram and all the req. and it still lags :(
[22:20] <csc> =\
[22:20] <DerSandman> DatOne, diamond is pretty common.
[22:20] <SpaceManiac> if you know where to look
[22:20] <Skorchy> The hell are you talking about?
[22:20] <Kitoari> you just need to dig deep and have a little luck
[22:20] <DatOneGuy> Good shit

[22:20] <DatOneGuy> Hahaa, I keep finding cows in trees
[22:20] <Skorchy> I looked in 23 caves, made 6 minining tunnels and found 1 diamond.
[22:20] <Unrealomega> I made an obsidian sword.
[22:20] <yoshibear> Oh god, I hope a goron doesnt get into my mine.....
[22:20] <KodaichiZerq> and my damn hammers
[22:21] <DerSandman> I have like 20 bricks of diamond legit,.. like 3 chests of redstone.

[22:21] <Unrealomega> It's not different than a diamond one.
[22:21] <Unrealomega> no*
[22:21] <Kitoari> or.. can you?
[22:21] <Kitoari> probably not :P
[22:21] <yoshibear> cant
[22:21] <yoshibear> not in the items
[22:21] <Unrealomega> Same amount of uses and power.
[22:21] <Skorchy> Hax?
[22:21] <Kitoari> yeah didn't think so
[22:21] <yoshibear> Its just changing the graphice
[22:21] <yoshibear> graphics*
[22:21] <Skorchy> I've never found enoughdiamond to make alot of tools legitly.
[22:21] <pocketprobe> csc, If you are certain that your video is working you may want to mail Notch. I'm not sure his Linux experiance but... yeah
[22:21] <Unrealomega> You guys are silly.
[22:21] <Skorchy> Took too damn long.
[22:21] <Unrealomega> I have an obsidian sword right here.
[22:22] <csc> pocketprobe, sure, can i be angry and spiteful towards him choosing java in the process of said email :)?
[22:22] <DatOneGuy> How do I gather feathers, are there chickens?
[22:22] <Kitoari> troll olo?
[22:22] <pocketprobe> csc, He hates C++
[22:22] <Skorchy> Why does my game lag alot, anyone know anything about it? Or how to make it run fastererer?
[22:22] <DerSandman> Csc, java is boss.
[22:22] <csc> java is fail
[22:22] <KodaichiZerq> obsidian maybe is too sturdy of a material to craft.
[22:22] <DerSandman> In your opinion.
[22:22] <Kitoari> java is meh
[22:22] <pocketprobe> And that is why Android runs like ass
[22:22] <pocketprobe> And why minecraft does too
[22:22] <Soviet_1> java is built-in cross OS compatible
[22:22] <KodaichiZerq> maybe obsidian tools should only be found as treasure
[22:22] <DatOneGuy> >implying iPhone is better than Java
[22:22] <csc> inefficient and as flakier than black market dealings
[22:22] <Soviet_1> at least the virtual machine is made to be like that
[22:22] <DatOneGuy> Haha, what
[22:22] <DatOneGuy> :\/
[22:23] <DerSandman> Minecraft runs about 70-120 fps for me, maxed.
[22:23] <pocketprobe> >implying i have an iphone
[22:23] <csc> the iphone sucks too
[22:23] <yoshibear> Feathers are from zombies
[22:23] <yoshibear> I dont know why...

[22:23] <Unrealomega> csc: For Notch's application, Java is what he wants. It's a lot more organized and it's currently better than silverlight.
[22:23] <DerSandman> The zombies eat all the chickens.
[22:23] <TehButter> Chickens what
[22:24] <DerSandman> Csc, if you don't like it, don't play it.
[22:24] <csc> Unrealomega, ill give him points for not using silverlight, but java still sucks
[22:24] <pocketprobe> Silverlight is just microsoft wanting to try to regain their monopoly
[22:24] <Unrealomega> csc: Why does Java suck?
[22:24] <KodaichiZerq> lol good explaantion for feathers
[22:24] <TehButter> Java is like
[22:24] <DatOneGuy> JAva has it's uses, just like C++.
[22:24] <TehButter> 40% of the internet?
[22:24] <DerSandman> Because he cannot run it on his 3rd rate OS.
[22:24] <TehButter> :B
[22:24] <DatOneGuy> For some things it's just better

[22:31] <DerSandman> Eh.. If the shirt had the checkered creeper skin texture, I would buy one.
[22:31] <pocketprobe> Me too
[22:32] <TrueWolves> I don't see the shirts much for buying them, rather donations with a thankyou, shirts normaly don't cost that much.
[22:32] <Grizzlechips> I wasn't sure if there was a way I could restore it or what
[22:32] <DatOneGuy> I'd buy a full creeper suit

[22:36] <DerSandman> you could use dirt\sand really.
[22:36] <DatOneGuy> I set it to peaceful while I looked around because those skeles always shoot me >_>
[22:36] <Skorchy> I learned not to make a house out of wood the hard way.
[22:36] <DatOneGuy> and I can't get close enough to use this sword
[22:36] <yoshibear> BUt you probably need torches for reddust in the first place
[22:37] <yoshibear> Creepers?
[22:37] <DerSandman> I want red dust to be useful
[22:37] <pocketprobe> Give me a few, portage is REALLYYYYYYY slow over NFS
[22:37] <Skorchy> I was using a flint cause I felt like burning a tree.
[22:37] <DerSandman> i have almost 3 entire chests of red dust, nothing to really use it on.
[22:37] <Skorchy> And my house caught on fire.
[22:37] <yoshibear> It burnt? @Scorchy
[22:37] <Skorchy> And it took me all of 3 seconds to remake :(
[22:37] <DerSandman> you should've slapped it out

[22:37] <DerSandman> :P
[22:37] <yoshibear> lol
[22:38] <yoshibear> ... you should get coal from burning logs...
[22:38] <csc> pocketprobe, one last thing to try before i tag another fail for ATi
[22:38] <DerSandman> fire is retardedly slow in minecraft.
[22:38] <pocketprobe> csc. 1.6.0.17
[22:38] <csc> pocketprobe, is the plain vga driver vga or vesa in X11, if you have any clue
[22:38] <csc> yeah im using 1.6.0.20
[22:38] <Skorchy> .. Anyway to move the spawn point in infdev?
[22:38] <csc> iirc
[22:38] <yoshibear> Fire is retardedly fast in real life... that makes it medium
[22:38] <Kael_> yoshibear: So wait. Burn Logs>Get coal that burns longer than logs?
[22:38] <KodaichiZerq> fire is mean
[22:38] <DerSandman> Skorchy, nope
[22:38] <pocketprobe> csc, vga is vga 640x480x8 and vesa is all the std ones
[22:38] <yoshibear> I guess?
[22:38] <DerSandman> Buring logs would get you charcoal, not coal. :P
[22:39] <KodaichiZerq> it cab kill me slowly, even if i have almost full hp
[22:39] <csc> think minecraft will like the vesa driver?
[22:39] <yoshibear> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!!!
[22:39] <Kael_> yoshibear: that just means that you could have lots of coal early game, without mining. coal doesnt even come from logs xD
[22:39] <pocketprobe> csc, Vesa does not provide any 3d acceleration. However I do not think it will
[22:39] <csc> eh well, only one way to see...
[22:39] <Skorchy> Well then, I am going to go through 324398 maps until I find one that spawns next to a cave.
[22:39] <DerSandman> Why?
[22:39] <pocketprobe> csc, **I do not think minecraft will like
[22:39] <yoshibear> You still need fire though
[22:39] <Skorchy> I can has mining.
[22:39] <DerSandman> You can walk aroudn from your spawn.
[22:39] <csc> yes, but if it fails to crash
[22:39] <yoshibear> Which takes either mining, or luck
[22:39] <csc> that pinpoints the problem
[22:39] <Armonte> Notch should cut the creeper shirt price inhalf
[22:39] <csc> brb
[22:39] <DerSandman> I never make a base directly on my spawn.
[22:39] <yoshibear> Which requires coal in the first place
[22:39] <pocketprobe> Are you using the open source driver or fglrx?
[22:40] <DerSandman> Does the shirt include shipping?
[22:40] <csc> my card is not supported by fglrx anymore
[22:40] <Kael_> So everyone, how do you think books are gonna be used in the future?
[22:40] <DerSandman> I couldn't find a price in euro.. :S
[22:40] <KodaichiZerq> creeper shirt is a tad too rpicey for me
[22:40] <Akai> I'm tempted to go find a code cracking game, and talk about the game here.
[22:40] <DerSandman> Books, made into bookcases, relatively useless.
[22:40] <CyanRyan> ..
[22:40] <TrueWolves> ...
[22:40] <Armonte> It's way too pricy
[22:40] <pocketprobe> Old fglrx?
[22:40] <Armonte> 30 bucks
[22:40] <Armonte> for ONE shirt
[22:40] <CyanRyan> I just realized my headphones are magnetized
[22:40] * jonnyabc is now known as MICKLEE
[22:40] <DatOneGuy> I'd buy the creeper shirt if I didn't have like 1,000 shirts from woot that I want
[22:40] <Reiginko> the game alone is expensive.
[22:40] <CyanRyan> Also fuck that
[22:40] <TrueWolves> Akai, I normaly hate anything realting to codes thanks to SMP, but that accualy made me laugh.
[22:40] <DatOneGuy> and considering the woot ones I want are only 13 bucks...
[22:40] <Reiginko> 12 dollars us right?
[22:40] * MICKLEE is now known as jonnyabc
[22:40] <CyanRyan> I paid less than half of that for the damn game
[22:41] <Kael_> Dersandman: That's right now, which isn't that great.
[22:41] <Reiginko> which for a game in alpha
[22:41] <Reiginko> i mean
[22:41] <DatOneGuy> The game is very cheap
[22:41] <Akai> But I've got this little voice in my head saying "That's a very stupid idea"
[22:41] <Akai> TrueWolves :P
[22:41] <Reiginko> no it isn't
[22:41] <DatOneGuy> Sure it is
[22:41] <DerSandman> How much is the creeper shirt in euro? o_O
[22:41] <DatOneGuy> 13 bucks for a full game?
[22:41] <csc> pocketprobe, from what ive googled, fglrx 9.3 is bricked in ubuntu
[22:41] <Reiginko> the game is overpriced for its content.
[22:41] <DatOneGuy> The game promises future content
[22:41] <DatOneGuy> and delivers regularly
[22:41] <Armonte> I could get my nonexistant girlfriend 2 t-shirts, a mug, a poster and a mousepad from the valve store
[22:41] <Armonte> for that

[22:42] <pocketprobe> csc, Well that sucks. Try vesa but i do not see you getting any farther due ot no dri
[22:42] <DerSandman> Eh, i don't care much for books.
[22:42] <csc> ugh
[22:42] <yoshibear> Hmm... peta-flare anyone?
[22:42] <DerSandman> Books will just be some gay RP shit.
[22:42] <csc> stupid ubuntu and disabling ctrl+alt+bksp
[22:42] <Kael_> Possibly.
[22:42] <DerSandman> i would pref a map imo.
[22:42] <Reiginko> i'm just saying the game isn't worth $12, a large bit of that is charity. the game isn't worth more than $5 imo. so to add more charity costs onto a shirt seems silly.

[22:47] <yoshibear> lol
[22:48] <Skwerly> macs are gay
[22:48] <Reiginko> so a lot of the cost of the game is charity. he's saying "give me money now to keep developing the game, even though you aren't getting what you paid for"
[22:48] <Reiginko> and we say
[22:48] <DerSandman> i run minecraft on n64.
[22:48] <Akai> Miclee, there's 232 people in the channel
[22:48] <Reiginko> "yeah, because it's a great concept"
[22:48] <TehButter> Reig:
[22:48] <TehButter> Where did you hear
[22:48] <Reiginko> that's all i'm saying.
[22:48] <DerSandman> Reign, he just started to make the game.
[22:48] <TehButter> that a lot is charity?
[22:48] <TehButter> Where?
[22:48] <Miclee> Reiginko, he told us what we're going to get.
[22:48] <Kitoari> reiginko: it's called a "preorder"
[22:48] <Kitoari> it happens lots
[22:48] <Akai> With a great enough number of people, you can present any topic, and there will be a difference of opinion
[22:48] <Kael_> Reiginko: implying im not getting what i paid for
[22:48] <DatOneGuy> Here's an idea: Don't like it, don't pay for it.
[22:48] <yoshibear> Because the internet is infested with 14 year olds
[22:48] <DatOneGuy> -Shrug- What's the problem?
[22:48] <TehButter> Now, think about this
[22:48] <Kitoari> and what we're getting is called a "preorder bonus"
[22:48] <TehButter> Your buying a game
[22:48] <DatOneGuy> People pay 80+ for preorders of REGULAR games
[22:48] <TehButter> That has the potential
[22:48] <Kitoari> those happen a lot, as it happens
[22:48] <DatOneGuy> We're paying less for a preorder
[22:48] <TehButter> to be FREAKING AWESOME.
[22:48] <DatOneGuy> :/
[22:48] <TehButter> And,
[22:48] <Akai> If you ask the entire world, "Is the sky blue?" You will have people arguing that it's not -blue- but a shade of blue. and others arguing that the sky is, in fact, purple
[22:49] <TehButter> your paying HALF PRICE.
[22:49] <Kael_> reiginko: and that i havent gotten my $15 back many times over from use of this game
[22:49] <Skwerly> My mines are infested with 14-year-olds too
[22:49] <DatOneGuy> Exactly!

[22:51] <DerSandman> TROLLIN.
[22:51] <pocketprobe> If activision published minecraft it would cost $84, redstone would be $15 DLC, and multiplayer would cost money.
[22:51] <Skwerly> I've paid lots of bad games, for an ALPHA game with bugs everywhere It is easily worth my 13.15

[22:52] <Akai> You know
[22:52] <TehButter> Epitaph:

[22:52] <Kael_> I like how the game is 15 dollars. I dont like however that within a matter of months it will be thirty. I believe when that happens, sales will drop tremendously, and he will revert it to 15. $15 is low enough to be an "on the fly" purchase. Most people wouldnt be willing to shell out 30 smackeroos for this.
[22:52] <DatOneGuy> Okay wtf..
[22:52] <DatOneGuy> Cows SWIM!?
[22:52] <TehButter> ....
[22:52] <TehButter> Yes, dat
[22:52] <Kitoari> I agree with kael actually
[22:52] <DatOneGuy> WHY do cows swim?
[22:52] <Akai> Reig's argument sounds like that thing I heard about stores marking up list prices for a sale

[23:01] <yoshibear> Coal IS easy
[23:01] <Monte> Kitoari: um

[23:02] <Monte> I'm going to take over things<3
[23:02] <DatOneGuy> Thanks Epitaph64
[23:02] <yoshibear> I skip coal nowadays
[23:02] <Dezerus> Fanboys are annoying.
[23:02] <Kitoari> k
[23:02] <Skorchy> Night everyone.
[23:02] <csc> pocketprobe, i think im just going to rebuild my gaming rig
[23:02] <DerSandman> Only thing i use linux for is running servers.
[23:02] <pocketprobe> csc, Do it
[23:02] <yoshibear> Agreed
[23:02] <yoshibear> And twifags are also annoying..........
[23:02] <DerSandman> Wait, gaming rig can't run minecraft?
[23:02] <pocketprobe> My server runs Linux.
[23:02] <csc> pocketprobe, its going to fscking suck on a gsm data tether
[23:02] <pocketprobe> csc, Fuck
[23:02] <yoshibear> argh this black blinking is annoying >.<
[23:02] <pocketprobe> +1
[23:02] <csc> yep, i do all my work over 20kb/s max
[23:03] <pocketprobe> Use pidgin's IRC stuff
[23:03] <Darkebrz> Haha pidgin?
[23:03] <csc> and linux connects to this out of the box, windows doesnt
[23:03] <Darkebrz> XChat
[23:03] <Kael_> I use opera.
[23:03] <csc> and just as an added point, if i were in a basement, i wouldn't have reception, nor internet ;)
[23:03] <yoshibear> What about Wii OS?
[23:03] <pocketprobe> I'm on msn on pidgin so why not use it for irc as well?
[23:03] <yoshibear> lol
[23:03] <DerSandman> isn't 20kb/s slower than dialup?
[23:03] <csc> pocketprobe, because its a horrible irc client
[23:03] <Skorchy> 0.0
[23:03] <Darkebrz> Terrible IRC client?
[23:03] <Darkebrz> yeah
[23:03] <Cial> yep
[23:03] <Skorchy> Im afraid of sleeping, yet I wanna sleep at the same time.
[23:04] <pocketprobe> It works for me
[23:04] <Kael_> Anyone else use Opera?

[23:06] <vede> The "evaluation" is free.
[23:07] <Miclee> You just have to wait on startup.

[23:07] <pocketprobe> I get 3megs/sec both ways on my GSM

[23:10] <Darkfire02> :)
[23:10] <Miclee> Why would you need to hack transformice?
[23:10] <DatOneGuy> I'd play some tr but nah :(
[23:10] <TrueWolves> the evaluation has all the features vede.
[23:10] <csc> its in spanish iirc
[23:10] <DatOneGuy> Hacking tr can be fun Miclee
[23:10] <Miclee> Really, it's so simple.
[23:10] <Miclee> There's no need to hack
[23:10] <TrueWolves> I've had it for 900 days now with out changing anything and can script and such and such...
[23:10] <DatOneGuy> but yeah it is pointless to ahck
[23:10] <vede> TrueWolves, I never said it didn't, did I?
[23:10] <Kael_> In windows 7, where is minecraft data stored?

[23:11] <TrueWolves> the whole 30 day thing is false, you can use it past that it doesn't stop you.
[23:11] <DatOneGuy> I have mIRC+NNS and everytime I want a feature and try to make it, I find it halfway through
[23:11] <Kitoari> transformice is amazing
[23:11] <Kael_> Thanks guys, how do i get it to show the appdata hidden folder again? >_<
[23:11] <DatOneGuy> If you're willing to wait 30 seconds, yes you can use it forever
[23:11] <vede> One massive feature mIRC lacks: cross-platform.
[23:11] <Viral> transformice is stupid
[23:11] <DatOneGuy> It's pester-ware,
[23:11] <Viral> Kael_, open any folder.

[23:12] <csc> in looks
[23:12] <Tukiko> mIRC has an evaluation period now? I had that for like 2 years without it asking for a key or anything.
[23:12] <Darkfire02> ?
[23:13] <Kael_> thanks viral, found it ^^
[23:13] <DatOneGuy> It doesn't Tukiko
[23:13] <TrueWolves> Tukiko, it has a 30 day deal, but you can use it past that.
[23:13] <DatOneGuy> It just pesters you after the 30 days
[23:13] <vede> Not that I'd use it anyway even if it did, because I wouldn't ever use a closed-source application when there's an open-source alternative that's just as good.

[23:13] <DatOneGuy> Pidgin IRC is the worst
[23:13] <DatOneGuy> It's great for MSN/AIM/YIM/GT though
[23:13] <Tukiko> TrueWolves: Can probably automate it.
[23:13] <Shrub> :X
[23:13] <Soviet_1> so far, it is working quite nice for me

[23:14] <Shrub> what do
[23:14] <Tukiko> die
[23:14] <DatOneGuy> Pidginf or IRC has many issues
[23:14] <Soviet_1> i just want my networking in one client
[23:14] <Dezerus> But I prefer web-based, so I use Mibbit.
[23:14] <Soviet_1> under that reason, i don't mind using pidgin's irc
[23:14] <vede> Pidgin is an IRC client the same way VLC is a web server.
[23:14] <Soviet_1> it is not native
[23:14] <Soviet_1> but then, it is quite neet to have all in one
[23:14] <pocketprobe> I found pidgin ok, it works, having everything together is kinda nice too. What is good to use in linux if i want something good. In windows I would usr mIRC
[23:15] <Soviet_1> i have aim, yahoo, msn, xfire, google talk, fb chat, and irc in one client
