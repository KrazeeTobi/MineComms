[0:10] <CyborgDragon> he told diablodoct0r he would make obsidian indestructible to tnt, after diablo suggested it
[0:10] <Vicrry> Unless the graphics card is ancient, graphics drivers tend to be compatible with everything ever made
[0:11] <Helar> say hello to my little friend
[0:11] <CyborgDragon> diablo said, and i'm paraphrasing, "Notch, you should make it so tnt doesn't blow up obsidian, because someone can still easily break into your hard-earned obsidian house with tnt"
[0:11] <Helar> lol the ending in kick-ass is epic
[0:11] <Diablodoct0r> ahem
[0:11] <Diablodoct0r> That was no what I said you sneaky bastard >_>

[0:21] <Drag> Hey, so
[0:21] <Drag> I don't suppose people actually talk about Minecraft in here?
[0:22] <Kond> what's the inertia on the minecart
[0:22] <Kond> how many blocks does it go forward for each block it goes downhill?
[0:22] <Gunmage> Drag if someone starts talking about it, almost everyone else does.
[0:22] <CyborgDragon> drag, we do, but we dont have to talk about it 24/7
[0:22] <Gunmage> Oh kond
[0:22] <Gunmage> Its like
[0:22] <Gunmage> 1 block of sloped rail
[0:22] <Vicrry> people do Drag - just not often as the title suggests :P
[0:22] <Gunmage> = 68 or 128 blocks
[0:22] <Drag> Ah, ok
[0:22] <Kond> 68 blocks, really?
[0:22] * Sorensor (Sorensor@ppp121-45-199-73.lns20.cbr1.internode.on.net) has joined #minecraft

[0:23] * Helar (Helar@78-28-77-30.cdma.dyn.kou.ee) has joined #minecraft
[0:23] <visiON> talks about
[0:23] <Gunmage> Its really far.
[0:23] <visiON> what..?
[0:23] <Kond> because im having trouble tuning my minecart path so that it would go minimum amount downwards for maximum amount forwards
[0:23] <vurtual> I got mugged to death in GTA IV
[0:23] <Drag> and when someone does, it's more like a quick "ok, let's talk so we can get it over with and go back to whatever else we were"
[0:23] <Gunmage> http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Minecart_Tracks
[0:23] <Drag> but anyway

[0:24] <Gunmage> They changed the page
[0:24] <Drag> but the offline client doesn't work
[0:24] <Gunmage> It used to tell you how far it would go.
[0:24] <visiON> whats that

[0:24] <Drag> It spits out the error about bad video card drivers
[0:24] <Gunmage> Its 78 blocks for one block of slope.
[0:25] <Drag> even though my drivers are as updated as they get
[0:25] <Helar> going outside naked.. maybe that helps
[0:25] <Marzanna> liq3 they can
[0:25] <CyborgDragon> blargh, drag, your name is highlighting me every time you speak, xD
[0:25] <Helar> shouldnt have said that..
[0:25] <Drag> heh, that's fine
[0:25] <liq3> Marzanna: oh?
[0:25] <Drag> I'll get out of here once someone gets back to me about my problem
[0:25] <Marzanna> well i think they can... also there are like 10 usernames and passwords going around on /v/
[0:25] <Serow> :[ I miss minecarts with storage.

[0:27] <Drag> My video card drivers are from the intel website

[0:41] <TheMilkMan> This seems to work nicelye though, CyborgDragon I Dug 2 blocks under the igloo to get in, so that when you're actually inside the ice is 2 blocks above and i have a torch in the middle of the room

[0:44] <blaster> Guild of industry players are real men
[0:44] <blaster> we use iron
[0:44] <TheMilkMan> Classy men use gold ^^
[0:44] <CyborgDragon> iron, i use it too, and i have a diamond pickaxe should i ever come across obsidian
[0:44] <blaster> Classy men die quickly
[0:44] <CyborgDragon> classy men wear a gold crown, no other armor, and use iron pickaxes
[0:45] <TheMilkMan> Well yea it's pointless to have a gold pic but I'd use gold armor
[0:45] <blaster> Also, the guild of industry is, as far as I know, the only democratic clan/guild in minecraft
[0:45] <blaster> The only use for gold armor I can think of is to distinguise certain troops in a unit wearing no armor
[0:46] <blaster> Like the leader of a squad wearing no armor
[0:46] <CyborgDragon> uhh, blaster, circle of magi is democratic
[0:46] <blaster> Realy?
[0:46] <CyborgDragon> it is now, at least, now that shadowdusk quit

[0:47] <Arsonide> Imagine a room. The walls are lined with buttons attached to trap doors on the floor just below them. ONE of the buttons opens the door at the end of the hall.
[0:47] <Arsonide> Though, it would be hard to hide which button did that cause of how obvious redstone is.

[1:14] <TheMilkMan> That's cus they were greifers

[1:15] * yoshibot puts a gladius through Shadaez :<
[1:15] <bildramer> sparti is just a city, yeah
[1:15] <vurtual> then the 300 cut through enemy troops nonstop
[1:16] <bildramer> btw in Greece there are ruins fucking everywhere
[1:16] <bildramer> I got tired of them
[1:16] <vurtual> even if all of them were fighting together, that's still like... dudde
[1:16] <Vicrry> lol
[1:16] <yoshibot> part of why it's so awesome to visit, i guess
[1:16] <TrueWolves``> The 300 didn't "cut through enemy troops nonstop" They stood ground in such a tight formation almost none of them died against the massive numbers of troops until they said fuck it and broke rank anyway.
[1:16] <yoshibot> but i can see getting bored with them after a while
[1:16] <bildramer> I lived there for the first like 12 years of my life
[1:16] <vurtual> TrueWolves``
[1:16] <vurtual> Okay, when you're in formation
[1:16] <vurtual> what are you generally doing?
[1:16] <bildramer> (Greece, not sparti)
[1:16] <vurtual> You can't just let the enemies SIT THERE
[1:17] <bildramer> vurtual, actually
[1:17] <bildramer> that worked very well in some battles
[1:17] <vurtual> YOU STAB THEM WHEN THEY COME CLOSE TO YOUR SPEARS
[1:17] <bildramer> shields up, 8-meter long spears
[1:17] <bildramer> win
[1:17] <vurtual> then more come, immortals and whatnot, gotta keep the defense
[1:17] <TrueWolves``> What I was saying is that they were not cutting through the troops, they killed the ones that got close.
[1:17] <Shadaez> Navineous wtf is this --> Halo - Main Theme
[1:17] <vurtual> stab and stab and stab and decimaate
[1:17] <Shadaez> you nerd fag
[1:17] <vurtual> yeah but they all came close
[1:17] <TrueWolves``> Cutting through implies moving through the enemy formation, which they did not do.
[1:17] <vurtual> until they basically ran out of killing strength, after all this time, and died bit by bit
[1:17] <visiON> coldplay ftw
[1:17] <vurtual> TrueWolves`` it's like falling on a sword

[2:31] <vede> I think this whole "You have a naked photograph of a fifteen-year-old" controversy is interesting.

[2:42] <Eagle> Just wondering, who remembers the time Notch let IRC test creative multiplayer?
[2:42] <FalseFoxes> I remember that
[2:42] <FalseFoxes> I missed it
[2:42] <FalseFoxes> 3=
[2:42] <bildramer> not me
[2:42] <Eagle> well not all of irc obviously
[2:42] <Eagle> I was there
[2:42] <vede> I got in on the second test.
[2:42] <Eagle> people kept breaking my house
[2:42] <bildramer> I joined afterwards :/
[2:42] <FalseFoxes> I showed up for part of the test for about... 5 minutes
[2:42] <Rooster> Eagle how many people did he invite?
[2:42] <Eagle> the channel
[2:42] <bildramer> but I wish I had joined the first time I encountered Minecraft, SP-only
[2:43] <bildramer> Java fucked me over ._.
[2:43] <Rooster> I know, but how many?
[2:43] <Eagle> which was about 10 people who actually were present
[2:43] <vede> Rooster, he just posted a link to the server.
[2:43] <FalseFoxes> Back then this channel was a lot smaller
[2:43] <Rooster> gasp
[2:43] <bildramer> I remember when he added new blocks to creative
[2:43] <Eagle> it wasn't like an exclusive thing
[2:43] <vede> Eagle, the server filled up to 32 people.
[2:43] <bildramer> and halfblocks etc.
[2:43] <ZomBuster> the 2nd time he had a rectangular map
[2:43] <FalseFoxes> I remember when we only had 4 blocks.
[2:43] <ZomBuster> it was revolutinary
[2:43] <bildramer> lol
[2:43] <Eagle> vede: oh yeah
[2:43] <Eagle> :P
[2:43] <Rooster> I joined right before he added sponges
[2:44] <bildramer> I joined some months before that block update
[2:44] <bildramer> TNT and all
[2:44] <Eagle> The 2nd time he had a really really long narrow map
[2:44] <vede> A bunch of people were on the IRC bein' all like AAARRRG SERVER FOLLLL
[2:44] <bildramer> it was like after summer I think
[2:44] <Drury> Yay, Infiniminer works! :D

[2:44] <bildramer> btw, have we went over 300?
[2:44] <Rooster> yes
[2:45] <Eagle> Dirt block, rock block, cobblestone block, wood block with the crappy texture it used to have
[2:45] <bildramer> then the limit is 400
[2:45] <Rooster> Does the attack count?
[2:45] <Eagle> the best blocks
[2:45] <bildramer> oh
[2:45] <vede> Heh, we've been over 3000.
[2:45] <bildramer> we need a bot to log the count of people
[2:45] <Rooster> 3000+ people
[2:45] <vede> But not with actual people.
[2:45] <bildramer> record most active times etc.
[2:45] <FalseFoxes> I first played the game on the 18th of may, 2009, joined the channel 4 days later
[2:45] <Rooster> Well, watching Zombieland
[2:45] <bildramer> BOT ATTACKS DO NOT COUNT
[2:45] <Keiya> Notch should use SCTP!
[2:45] <Drury> I don't really care if Notch will chose me to test SMP... OMG I WANT TO BE THE FIRST ONE PLAYING SMP SO MUCH!!!
[2:45] <Keiya> Not TCP or UDP!
[2:45] <bildramer> lol
[2:45] <bildramer> notch should use LAN
[2:46] <bildramer> *trollface*

[2:46] <bildramer> nice one
[2:47] <Eagle> What
[2:47] <Keiya> There's IL! But that handles long-distance connections horribly
[2:47] <Keiya> And was only ever used in plan9 anyway
[2:47] <bildramer> ...lol...
[2:48] <bildramer> BananaBot needs user count graphs
[2:48] <bildramer> who made it?
[2:48] <Keiya> And Minecraft should /definately/ be written with support for ipv6 if the host has a connection
[2:48] <vede> SMP servers should work by sending email with data in them to an address that the client specifies, and the client sends email to a mail server at the same IP as the server.
[2:48] <bildramer> /definitely/
[2:48] <bildramer> fffffff
[2:48] <bildramer> haha
[2:48] <bildramer> there are some actual games over email
[2:48] <vede> So after a few minutes of playing you can be like "Oh I have nineteen thousand new emails!"

[3:26] <FalseFoxes> XD
[3:26] <FalseFoxes> What is it? 8 gold + apple?
[3:26] <gordenfreechmen> why would you waste 72 ingots and a dungeon trip just to grt an instant healer
[3:26] <gordenfreechmen> FalseFoxes: 8 gold blocks
[3:26] <FalseFoxes> O.o
[3:26] <BarryLikesBnBns> Gwen's ver was annoyingly likable
[3:26] <Drury> I'm not sure if it's really possible to craft a golden apple...
[3:26] <Drury> but I found one in dungeon
[3:26] <gordenfreechmen> it is, drury
[3:26] <FalseFoxes> Golden Apples will be the most valuable tradeing currency then huh?
[3:26] <CyborgDragon> it is possible drury
[3:26] <CyborgDragon> i tested it again
[3:27] <gordenfreechmen> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_55hny_ULs
[3:27] <CyborgDragon> i doubt gold would make a great trading currency
[3:27] <CyborgDragon> unless notch makes it so we can turn it into gold coins
[3:27] <FalseFoxes> No, but golden apples will.
[3:27] <FalseFoxes> ... coins are more useless then the blocks themselves
[3:27] <gordenfreechmen> the blocks make good decoratio
[3:27] * FalseFoxes HATES it when people automaticly assume coins = useful in a game with no NPC shops.
[3:27] <gordenfreechmen> n
[3:28] <gordenfreechmen> servers wont be massive 100 people mmorpg-like ones
[3:28] <FalseFoxes> That's why coins are even more useless then the blocks, the blocks are good decoration.
[3:28] <gordenfreechmen> and nothing more
[3:28] <FalseFoxes> The less people, the more worthless coins become.
[3:28] <CyborgDragon> falsefoxes, notch has expressed interest in NPCs -.-
[3:28] <Drury> Three grilled pork is much cheaper way to restore full health...

[3:47] * geraldbrent makes serious face
[3:47] <TrueWolves> The only reason I like being an op is I like A: helping people and B: B& HAMMAH TROLL
[3:47] <TrueWolves> But I'm not a good op. X3

[3:50] * Quatroking is mass converting stereoscopic porn
[3:50] <vede> If you're not an op you have more ability to choose who you help.
[3:50] <mnjiman> ..
[3:50] <TrueWolves> I'm the kind of person who'd be willing to help any one, even if they called me an enemy.
[3:50] <bza> i can't wait for... bigger ruins
[3:50] <bza> not just one room dealies like we have now
[3:50] <AhrenJB> I have a feeling there will be some sort of rank/team/group based prop protection.
[3:51] <vede> Because if you're an op and you tell someone they're too ignorant to be trying to use a computer people will think you're a terrible person.
[3:51] <Quatroking> I'm the kind of person who flips retards off
[3:51] <bza> hah
[3:51] <vede> But if you're not an op and you say that you're just a normal person.

[3:54] <Serow> Albino
[3:54] <Shadaez> never show me a white black again
[3:54] <CyborgDragon> serow: mind blower, africans of caucasian descent
[3:54] <mnjiman> multiple reasons for an issue to occur Animator, the real issue though is whether or not they listen to reason and whether or not they do it more then once.

[3:54] <CyborgDragon> also, serow, that guy isnt full albino
[3:54] <mnjiman> I mean if you can settle the issue quickly but having an understanding, then he wasnt really a troll...
[3:54] <AhrenJB> Wanna see an African that isn't actually black? Google "Obama"
[3:54] <CyborgDragon> if he were full albino he wouldnt have green eyes
[3:55] <mnjiman> but if he just fights for the sake of it (and you can tell right away) then well you know
[3:55] <Animator> You're probably right on that (except the sensitive part, that one's a very rare problem in the IRC. Forum is another story.)
[3:55] <vurtual> How to become hungry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate
[3:55] <vurtual> detailed there
[3:55] <CyborgDragon> vurt, just the link makes me hungry, you ass

[3:56] <geraldbrent> lol
[3:56] <vurtual> \o/
[3:56] <Serow> Human albinos have different colored eyes, CyborgDragon.
[3:56] <CyborgDragon> no serow, a full albino will have red eyes
[3:56] <vurtual> green eyes are cool
[3:56] <mnjiman> My eyes turn green.. and light grey
[3:56] <mnjiman> and green blue
[3:56] <mnjiman> or grey green
[3:57] <Animator> My eyes are turning jade-green over the years, with leftover pieces of brown.
[3:57] <LG_Legacy> And then we all die

[3:57] <TrueWolves> Human albinos?

[3:57] * Cial (chatzilla@209-42-178-131.wispnet.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:57] <geraldbrent> moo
[3:57] <TrueWolves> Albinos of any (at least mammial for sure) spieces have pink or sky-blue eye color
[3:58] <CyborgDragon> partial albinism, where some body parts dont lack pgiment
[3:58] <CyborgDragon> if you're fully albino, you are albino everywhere, including the eyes(making them red)
[3:58] <TrueWolves> thus the pink comment.
[3:58] <CyborgDragon> partial albinism can be anything from albinism in everything but the eyes, to albinism in say, only a pinky
[3:58] <Serow> CyborgDragon - In most animals that's true. Not for humans. Most appear white, blue, or purplish. Human eyes aren't built the same.
[3:59] <CyborgDragon> serow, that's because human eyes have multiple pigments
[3:59] <CyborgDragon> a full albino will have red eyes, all the pigments being albino
[3:59] <TrueWolves> Humans /can/ have red eyes from full albinoisium Serow.
[3:59] <Serow> They can, I didn't exclude it TrueWolves.
[3:59] <CyborgDragon> the purple comes from one pigment being blue, the other being nothing
[3:59] <vurtual> albino only down there
[3:59] <vurtual> scare people with it
[4:00] <Shadaez> you guys are nerds
[4:00] * TrueWolves 's eyes are slate blue but they have a faint yellow around the center he got from his mother.
[4:00] <vurtual> having albino eyes only really makes them red under lighting conditions
[4:00] * Cial (chatzilla@209-42-178-131.wispnet.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[4:00] * vurtual has hardcore green eyes, just a bit short of pure gordonfreemany green
[4:01] <TrueWolves> If my eyes dialate right, they turn a slight green becuase of it.
[4:01] <vurtual> Green eyes represent.
[4:01] <CyborgDragon> also, not all purple eyes are from albinism
[4:01] <vurtual> Yeah, CyborgDragon
[4:01] <vurtual> For example:
[4:01] <vurtual> Me punching you.
[4:01] <Quatroking> my eyes are yellow

[4:23] <CyborgDragon> damn you quatro, my little sister almost saw, good thing she was too focused on playing sm64 to notice
[4:23] <TrueWolves> Which costs money.
[4:23] <Quatroking> its a voxel woman
[4:24] <Quatroking> you can't even see her tits that well
[4:24] <CyborgDragon> even so, my little sister isn't the best person, she has tell about every little last thing
[4:24] <CyborgDragon> in fact, i dont even know why i let her play on my n64
[4:25] <CyborgDragon> oh wait, it's so she can be a better person
[4:25] <CyborgDragon> i hope it works
[4:25] <lenox> n64 = better person?
[4:25] <lenox> i never had one :(
[4:25] <CyborgDragon> oold games=better person
[4:25] <CyborgDragon> old*
[4:25] <lenox> n64 is not old enough
[4:25] <Quatroking> "mommy mommy timmy looked at a picture of a blocky woman who looks like a 3d version of dialup porn" "**stab**"
[4:25] <CyborgDragon> also, it should hopefully force her to think, which she never does
[4:25] <lenox> snes + earthbound = better person
[4:26] <CyborgDragon> you mean SNES+mother 1, mother 2=better person
[4:26] <lenox> no...
[4:26] <lenox> mother 1 is for nes
[4:26] <CyborgDragon> Yes.
[4:27] <CyborgDragon> and the snes can play nes games
[4:27] <Quatroking> I actually did once try to build this: http://2photo.ru/uploads/posts/4268/20090708/jean-yves-lemoigne/08_07_2009_0114712001247000167_jean-yves-lemoigne.jpg

[4:37] <Kiyako> tbh TNT is basically useless, sans putting it in 4x1 corridoors every 4.

[4:38] <Kiyako> not 6x1?

[4:38] <CyborgDragon> why 4x1?
[4:38] <TrueWolves> It's a family computer, I didn't pick what OS was on it when we bought it.
[4:38] <Kiyako> I was under the impression that tnt had a blast radias of 4x1.
[4:39] <Kiyako> CyborgDragon - vista isn't too bad.
[4:39] <TrueWolves> But it IS a RAM hog
[4:39] <CyborgDragon> tnt's blast radius varies
[4:39] <DEElekgolo> ehe
[4:39] <Kiyako> ah,
[4:39] <DEElekgolo> http://deelekgolo.codebrainshideout.net/Pics/2010-07-12_1739.png
[4:39] <Kiyako> if its mininmum is 4,
[4:39] <AhrenJB> Ahhhhh I hear zombies and spiders somewhere near.
[4:39] <TrueWolves> And I just don't have the RAM to feed it and play games, D=
[4:39] <Kiyako> then yes, deffinately 4.
[4:39] <CyborgDragon> depending on the materials it hits
[4:39] <AhrenJB> In my shaft mine.
[4:39] <Kiyako> TrueWolves - It really depends what games you want to play.
[4:39] <CyborgDragon> it actually has a minimum of 3x3x3
[4:40] <Kiyako> Cyb - Hm, Even so, then 6x1 would be alot better.
[4:40] <CyborgDragon> which is against stone and obsidian
[4:40] <Kiyako> cause
[4:40] <TrueWolves> Kiy, this computer will lag anything not at min specs, and about third of the games I try to play, even min specs risks my computer locking up at a random momment.
[4:40] <Kiyako> every 6 spaces
[4:40] <CyborgDragon> if you want to get technical, 1x1x1 against adminium(nothing is blown up other than the tnt)
[4:40] <CyborgDragon> kiyako, tnt falls too
[4:40] <TrueWolves> a third of games also lag in a way to make certain parts of them painful or even unwinable.
[4:41] <Kiyako> I have 2 kb lag.
[4:41] <Kiyako> ..
[4:41] <Kiyako> 2 gb ram*
[4:41] <Kiyako> wow.
[4:41] <Kiyako> what the hell am I on
[4:41] <gordenfreechmen> lesbians
[4:41] <Kiyako> True - It's probably not your RAM.
[4:41] <TrueWolves> It is my RAM
[4:41] <TrueWolves> my CPU is accualy preaty good (for being a unicore)
[4:41] <CyborgDragon> also, can anyone confirm the rumor that notch quadrupled the uses you get out of diamond?
[4:42] <CyborgDragon> it certainly seems like it's more than it was before
[4:42] <Kiyako> Vista doesnt eat the RAM, it uses it to make the computer faster, then gives it up as you need it.
[4:42] <CyborgDragon> and it takes forever to give it up
[4:42] <TrueWolves> The problem is when Vista hands off the RAM to slowly.
[4:42] <TrueWolves> Which is all the time when you only have a gig of it.
[4:42] <TrueWolves> And the computer locks up becuase the game just can't run.
[4:42] <gordenfreechmen> CyborgDragon: use it until you have 128 stone blocks

[7:57] <Budda> ooo phoenix
[7:57] <LordA> Yes Cyborg
[7:57] <LordA> That is what makes Orks so awesome
[7:57] <CyborgDragon> as in, if a warhammer 40k thought a stick shot a laser, it'll shoot a laser
[7:57] <LordA> Nope
[7:57] <LordA> It only enhances the effect

[7:59] <LordA> AND it still must look like the item

[7:59] <LordA> Nuuuuu
[7:59] <CyborgDragon> fucking psychic orks, how do they work?

[9:52] <Rooster> vede I pronounce it "wah-oil"

[9:53] <Wolfman992> Minecraft would be better with giant lamps that compliment you on how much dirt you've collected.
[9:53] <vede> I can say "Wah-oil" but "waoil" all as a joint sound is... .____.

[10:54] <Shrub> D:<
[10:54] * Shrub beats FW
[10:54] <gordenfreechmen> oh well that was simple enough
[10:54] <vede> I imagine quite a few would go on eating plants with a bad feeling in the back of their minds, and most others would decide that if they're going to be eating one thing they may as well eat the rest. And quite a few out of both groups will fall for terrible scams and donate craptons of money to people claiming to to be studying ways to make edible and nutritious foods out of things that aren't and weren't ever alive somehow.
[10:54] <Shrub> what
[10:54] <Cat> wat
[10:54] <TrueWolves> ...
[10:54] <TrueWolves> I think that's mostly correct vede. =D
[10:55] <Cat> vede whats up with you and vegetarians/vegans...?
[10:55] <Cat> :)
[10:55] <vede> Cat, huh?
[10:55] <FalseWolves> Cause they is fun to trollzors?
[10:55] <TrueWolves> But most vegans/vegitatierians will subconsiusly ignore any comments about plants having feelings and usualy being alive while being eaten.
[10:55] <FalseWolves> Shrub
[10:55] <FalseWolves> That was soooo... semxy.
[10:55] <FalseWolves> *smexy
[10:55] <vede> I got nothin' against veggie homeys, Cat.
[10:55] <TrueWolves> Just like what my sister does when I warn her she's ending up like her father in attatude.
[10:56] <TrueWolves> Or when my mother tells her the same thing e.e
[10:56] <Cat> i was a vegetarian...
[10:56] <FalseWolves> Well, Plants are alive
[10:56] <vede> FalseWolves, but do they 'feel' in the same way that animals do?
[10:56] <FalseWolves> Sure
[10:56] <TrueWolves> No,
[10:56] <FalseWolves> they got nerves, right?
[10:56] <Cat> for like 1 week... then started eating live pigs... :/ damn i was hungry...
[10:56] <TrueWolves> No they do not false.
[10:56] <FalseWolves> .....
[10:56] <FalseWolves> Live pigs?
[10:56] <FalseWolves> Oh, ok.
[10:56] <FalseWolves> Still, they is alive
[10:57] <FalseWolves> And if you dont eat animals
[10:57] <FalseWolves> Cause they is alive...

[10:59] <vede> I've considered trying out a full-vegetarian diet for a month or two, just to see what all the food is like.
[10:59] <gordenfreechmen> what the hell is a khrone

[11:00] * Cat runs away
[11:00] <vede> I mean, most food I eat is pretty simple stuff. Meat, bread, cheese, noodles. I assume veggie food is a lot more heavy on the greens and sauces, so it might be interesting to try.
[11:00] <Shrub> slate eyes? awesome
[11:01] <TrueWolves> My eyes are slate colored when dialated, otherwise they are a deep blue with a yellow center tinge.

[11:44] * bildramer hopes he won't get IWBTG-rolled again
[11:44] <TrueWolves> You won't.
[11:45] <TrueWolves> It's a good game.
[11:45] <bildramer> blatant, obvious lies
[11:45] <TrueWolves> It's a hard game at times, and a surprising one... but a great game.
[11:45] <TrueWolves> no where naer IWBTG though

[11:46] <programax> hello
[11:46] <Shrub> programax are you an impotency medicine>?
[11:46] <programax> I just started and wondered if there is a tutorial or the likes. For example, how do I get my first pickaxe?
[11:46] <TrueWolves> Prog, the wiki is the best bet.
[11:46] * gordenfreechmen (pigman@108.100.249.57) Quit (Quit: Orion 1.8 - Get it at http://tellini.info/index_en.html)
[11:47] <TrueWolves> It's the closest thing we have to a tutorial tell notch adds an offical one in game.
[11:47] <programax> visite3d the wiki. Saw things such as what types of blocks, game types, etc
[11:47] <TrueWolves> Go to crafting
[11:47] <TrueWolves> It doubles as a sort of how to get started page.
[11:47] * TrueWolves would write up a Tutorial page if he had the time, perhaps if no one does it by weeks end.
[11:48] <Shrub> I wonder what the tutorial level will look like
[11:49] <tyteen4a03> sounds interesting
[11:49] <Shisno> I might make a tutorial, sans images.
[11:49] <programax> okay so...I'm looking at the pickaxe section under crafting
[11:49] <programax> there are things I don't get
[11:49] <TrueWolves> Start from the top, read the page.
[11:49] <Shisno> You guys can add in images if you want
[11:49] <Shisno> would that be okay?
[11:49] <programax> like 1.) how do I get the wood for the handle? 2.) How do I get a 3x3 grid? Mine is 2x2?
[11:49] <Shisno> okay
[11:49] <Shisno> program,
[11:49] <Shisno> punch a tree down
[11:49] <TrueWolves> prog, this is why I said Don't skip to pickaxes. -.-;
[11:49] <programax> And the lowest material for it is...not dirt, right? So how do I get that?
[11:49] <TrueWolves> the workbench, is the first thing on the list
[11:49] <Shisno> tell me when you have four tree trunks.
[11:49] <programax> oh sorry, I must have missed that :D
[11:50] <programax> kk
[11:50] <programax> it's night right now, scared to go find a tree :D
[11:50] <Shisno> Make a new save.
[11:50] <TrueWolves> as Shisno said, punch some trees down.
[11:50] <Shisno> Your first things you should do is collect 3 or 4 trunks.
[11:50] <Shisno> 3 for just stone tools sans the first pickaxe.
[11:51] <Shisno> I suggest 3. :)
[11:51] <TrueWolves> Well
[11:51] <TrueWolves> Just kill 1 tree
[11:51] <TrueWolves> it gives you 3~6 trunks.
[11:52] <programax> I have 5
[11:52] <programax> back in my happy area
[11:52] <Shisno> Okay.
[11:52] <Shisno> Go to your inventory
[11:52] <Shisno> now drag the trunks into "crafting"
[11:52] * glaxtar (Poopoopee@c-76-104-190-132.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[11:52] <Shisno> and youll be able to drag out planks.
[11:53] <TrueWolves> put a plank on each of the 4 slots on the 2x2 grid
[11:53] <TrueWolves> right click to seperate the stack of planks.
[11:53] <Shisno> You can do that by right clicking on the spaces in the 2x2 grid while holding your planks
[11:53] <programax> it seems to drag the stack of 5 into one slot, not into the 4 separate slots
[11:53] <programax> oh
[11:53] <programax> nm I understand
[11:53] <TrueWolves> Thats why we are saying to rightclick >.>;
[11:54] <Shisno> but,
[11:54] <Shisno> first you need the trunks into planks.
[11:54] <NateTheGreat> you can keep clicking the newly created item to stack it up on your cursor
[11:54] <TrueWolves> <Shisno> now drag the trunks into "crafting" <Shisno> and youll be able to drag out planks.
[11:54] <Shisno> yes.

[11:55] <Shisno> X is empty.
[11:55] <Shisno> And youll make 4 sticks.
[11:55] <Shisno> this is all you need to make a pickaxe. :]
[11:56] <bildramer> what the fuck is this wall of death
[11:56] <bildramer> halp
[11:56] <TrueWolves> XD
[11:56] <TrueWolves> Isn't eversion fun?
[11:56] <programax> so...once I have a workbench how do I ..use it?
[11:56] <programax> I placed it in the world
[11:56] <Shisno> place the bench
[11:56] <Shisno> then right click it
[11:56] <TrueWolves> place it on the ground, right click
[11:56] <programax> ah, thanks

[12:01] <Shisno> http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/5361/wtfyhz.jpg
[12:01] <programax> the wiki says torches can only be found in indev and infdev. But can they be constructed in alpha?
[12:01] <AhrenJB> Mining obsidian is SO tiresome.
[12:01] <Shisno> aplha = infdev.
[12:01] <programax> oh sexy
[12:01] <Shisno> alpha*
[12:01] <Shisno> yesh. :)
[12:01] <Shrub> Alpha is just new infdev, so yes.
[12:01] <Shisno> But yeah
[12:01] <Shisno> I generate a new level,
[12:02] <Shisno> And I get that for a bit
[12:02] <Shisno> if i alt tab out
[12:02] <bildramer> what the fuck, Eversion

[12:03] <Shisno> TrueWolves?
[12:03] <TrueWolves> hmm? oh sorry
[12:03] * TrueWolves is is skin crafting. >.>
[12:04] * TrueWolves checks
[12:04] <programax> okay so...because axes are super useful in this game, and they require wood
[12:04] <programax> err pickaxes I mean
[12:04] <programax> do trees respawn? :D
[12:04] <TrueWolves> you need to plant new ones.
[12:04] <programax> are trunks my super-valuable resource? I assume no
[12:04] <TrueWolves> and I use stone for my pick axes.
[12:04] <TrueWolves> Wood is easy and renewable.
[12:05] <programax> How do I plant trees?
[12:05] <Shrub> kill leaves get sapling
[12:06] <TrueWolves> When you chop down a tree the leaves will fall and drop saplings
[12:06] <bildramer> why did I just randomly die
[12:06] <TrueWolves> Also, I have no clue why it does that, do you have twitter Shisno?

[12:35] <digitalrushdude> also i think level 7 is my favorite, you can go all the way up and down in the crazyness
[12:35] <TrueWolves> I liked the old level 8
[12:35] <TrueWolves> Where it would rapidly change between all of them with out warning or pattern
[12:35] <digitalrushdude> old level 8 was annoying for that very reason
[12:35] <digitalrushdude> i like the new one much better
[12:35] <TrueWolves> There was so many ways to bypass parts becuase of it
[12:36] <TrueWolves> the new one is nice too though.
[12:36] <digitalrushdude> there is that though
[12:36] <digitalrushdude> although you can get past the new one fairly quickly as well

[12:38] <TrueWolves> wtf? XD
[12:38] * Detox (Mibbit@83.151.21.218) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

[12:40] <vede> I know.
[12:40] <TrueWolves> Texture colors? no problem
[12:40] <digitalrushdude> monecroft
[12:40] <vede> Manecraft
[12:41] <TrueWolves> useing both layers in a way that doesn't look like shit? takes practice.
[12:41] <TrueWolves> The silver cat skin I'm using now should be proof enough I can do texture color easy.
[12:41] <digitalrushdude> both layers?
[12:41] <vede> Er, I'd reserve the top layer for accessories, not hair.
[12:41] <digitalrushdude> did he change stuff again?
[12:41] <TrueWolves> I've seen both layers togeather make some awesome combinations though.
[12:42] <TrueWolves> digital, there is a second head layer on the minecraft skin.
[12:42] <digitalrushdude> also is notch ever here

[12:56] <Shrub> Better.
[12:56] <TrueWolves> Thoughts?
[12:56] <Shrub> But still hurts.
[12:56] <AhrenJB> Pickaxes need to have an alternate fire where they mine bricks twice as fast, but also take twice as much damage.
[12:56] <bildramer> dark
[12:56] <TrueWolves> ... too dark
[12:56] <Askee> ack! mien eyes!
[12:56] <Visiiri> I don't really like the background.
[12:56] <Shrub> It's like Vegas
[12:56] <Shrub> but nerdy
[12:56] <Visiiri> You should do grey
[12:56] <Shrub> Yes grey
[12:56] <Shrub> dark grey
[12:56] <Visiiri> grey looks good with those colors
[12:56] <bildramer> you should do rainbow
[12:56] <Visiiri> (Especially purple.)
[12:56] <digitalrushdude> rainbow with random foreground and background colors :D
[12:56] <digitalrushdude> DO EET
[12:57] <Shrub> Alrighty I'm DLing Eversion :D

[12:58] <digitalrushdude> do 14 for bakgound
[12:58] <Visiiri> with whitespace on either side?

[13:04] <TrueWolves> I'm /trying/ to make it readable
[13:04] <Chris-_-> Lies
[13:05] <TrueWolves> Which isn't easy when everyone uses a diffrent color scheme
[13:05] * laCour|Offline is now known as laCour
[13:05] <TrueWolves> But it needs colors becuase it's large, colors help sections stand out.
[13:05] <TrueWolves> ...!
[13:05] <TrueWolves> I have an idea!!
[13:05] <Shrub> If only there were spacers

[13:06] <TrueWolves> There, now there is seperations but it should mold to each of your color schemes
[13:06] <Shrub> Seems the same, but whatever, nobody looks at the topic anyway.

[13:09] <vede> TrueWolves, I support the topic being highlighted.
[13:09] <vede> If you could attach lights and whistles and firecrackers that'd be nice too.
[13:09] <Foe> Highlight it in hot pink
[13:09] <TrueWolves> vede, the problem with the highlighting is it was diffrent for everyone's color settings
[13:10] <TrueWolves> I was trying to make it readable for everyone... no color scheme would do really.
[13:10] <vede> Because goddammit, it seems like NO ONE AT ALL EVER IN THE WHOLE WORLD even realizes that that line saying "Rules!" matters.
[13:10] <Shrub> Needs spacers.
[13:10] <TrueWolves> People who break the rules get kicked and banned.

[13:35] <Hyperion> i think its by running on java

[13:35] <Hyperion> minecraft need to be more like other games

[13:40] <liq3> DDRJake: motivation? xD
[13:40] <liq3> That is what stops me from programming. :(
[13:41] <TrueWolves> No one with in 20 miles is willing to hire someone with no exeperince currently.
[13:41] <Shadaez> TrueWolves same here :(
[13:41] <TrueWolves> And some people live in the middle of no where at all.
[13:41] <Foe> TW what the did you do
[13:41] <Shadaez> it sucks a lot
[13:41] <Tukiko> liq3: Figure out a motivation then. That's how I got started on my latest project. :P
[13:41] <liq3> Tukiko: I don''t think I will.
[13:41] <Shrub> Good god
[13:41] <TrueWolves> My cousin for instance lives 35 miles out of town, that's hardly biking distince and even then your not going to get good hours.
[13:41] <liq3> Tukiko: I think programming may not be my "calling" so to speak.
[13:41] <liq3> ;P
[13:42] <DDRJake> howo ld are you, TW?
[13:42] <liq3> TrueWolves: wtf 35 miles? That's AGES away.
[13:42] <Tukiko> liq3: Understandable. :P
[13:42] <DDRJake> *how old, god my typing is down the dregs
[13:42] <liq3> that's like 50km or further.
[13:42] <liq3> -.-
[13:42] <TrueWolves> When you are desperate liq3, it's bikeable
[13:42] <Hyperion> i would remove wooden tools
[13:42] <Hyperion> and when you mine cobblestone, you get 9 stones
[13:42] <TrueWolves> Why Hyperion? wooden tools are needed to get to stone tools.
[13:42] <TrueWolves> ...
[13:43] <Tukiko> Hyperion: How do you mine for cobblestone without a pick?
[13:43] <Hyperion> but we should get stone tools by
[13:43] <TrueWolves> That completely breaks the game ballance and half the point of "survival" being difacult.
[13:43] <Hyperion> no, there should be pebbles
[13:43] * TrueWolves sighs.
[13:43] <TrueWolves> "There should there should there should"
[13:43] <Tukiko> I dont think you can make a full axe out of some skipping stones
[13:43] <Hyperion> if you mine stone with hollow hand, you can get them
[13:43] <Shadaez> I wish my laptop supported 3 monitors :((
[13:43] <TrueWolves> IF you think there should be all these things go make the game your self... >.>
[13:43] <liq3> TrueWolves: well I don't mean that. 35 miles isn't really a reasonable commute everyday.
[13:43] <liq3> :P
[13:44] <TrueWolves> liq3, if you are desperate, it's bikeable.
[13:44] <Hyperion> man i am just telling you my idea
[13:44] <Shadaez> I'd travel 35 miles for a min wage job, right now :|
[13:44] <Tukiko> Hyperion: You can't expect to give an idea out to the public without receiving feedback.
[13:44] <AhrenJB> While I like some of the new water dynamics, I'm a bit miffed that if I dig a trench into the ocean, it won't fill a lakebed.
[13:44] <Tukiko> AhrenJB: I'm sure he'll work on it eventually
[13:44] <liq3> AhrenJB: as am I.

[14:09] <TrueWolves> 72
[14:09] <Demki> Shrub, same
[14:09] <Shrub> :D
[14:09] <Demki> And I found the first dungeon I found about 5 minutes after they were released
[14:09] <Demki> lol
[14:09] <TrueWolves> That is 3 full sets of armor!!
[14:09] <Demki> I was lucky
[14:10] <Demki> TrueWolves, a golden apple is a better use of gold than armor
[14:10] <TrueWolves> 3 full sets of armor crammed in to one eatable object of delishiusness.
[14:10] <Demki> A golden apple fully heals you
[14:10] <Shrub> Golden Apples probably taste crap
[14:10] <GaKo> I never found any dungeon...
[14:10] <TrueWolves> Funfact: the golden apple was orignaly not a real item rumored to be dropped by a hard to kill Notch mob that only showed up at the bottom of the map in caves on indev
[14:11] <Demki> It is better to make a golden apple, than to use the regular apple
[14:11] <TrueWolves> Notch said he'd add real golden apples (and maybe notch mobs) after finding out about this.
[14:11] <Shrub> Notch moob ftw
[14:11] <Demki> since regular apples only heal for 2 hearts
[14:11] <TrueWolves> That was /months/ ago
[14:11] <TrueWolves> Also
[14:11] <TrueWolves> We learned something
[14:11] <TrueWolves> Gold is editable by a MineCrafter.
[14:12] <Shisno> gold actually has a use! ^(o.o)^
[14:12] <Demki> Yes
[14:12] <Demki> it does
[14:12] <TrueWolves> He compresses it in to the size of an apple using a real apple as a print with his super strength
[14:12] <DDRJake> whaat?
[14:12] <Demki> for a 1 time, fully healing apple, you need 8 gold blocks
[14:12] <Shrub> I blame the hiphop
[14:12] <TrueWolves> And the super-compressed gold is a vitalizing snack for the minecrafter.

[14:19] <GaKo> Okay, so
[14:19] <GaKo> I'm making a Test Zone
[14:19] <GaKo> In my /game/ with the map editor
[14:19] <GaKo> In the air.
[14:19] <GaKo> With thousand of Iron block.
[14:20] <GaKo> I quit
[14:20] <GaKo> Then I reopen the game
[14:20] <GaKo> I see THOUSAND OF FLYING PIG
[14:20] <vede> Damn you, tvtropes! DAMN YOU! I decide to read the tvtropes article on Glenn Beck, and six hours later I'm reading fucking Hot Fuzz Danny/Nicholas slash-fiction.
[14:20] <liq3> Shrub: i think i got the bad ending. That was pretty meh. -.-
[14:20] <GaKo> I think the spawner is a bit screwed up.
[14:20] <vede> btw: http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3818121/1/HOT_FUZZ
[14:20] <bildramer> btw
[14:20] <bildramer> Eversion uses SDL
[14:20] <bildramer> :D
[14:20] <liq3> SDL is win.
[14:20] <Azathoth> they're waiting for you.... in the test chamber
[14:21] <Shrub> "Hot Fuzz Danny/Nicholas"
[14:21] <Shrub> why
[14:21] <GaKo> because.
[14:21] <Shrub> is the steam version of Eversion different?

[14:23] <GaKo> I want a CreeperXSkeletton story.
[14:24] <Demki> Minecraft is a medieval fantasy
[14:24] <vede> Minecraft's theme is like the theme of your average children's show.
[14:24] <Shrub> The skeleton stared into the creeper's hollow eyes, and slowly crouched, getting closer, skeleton opened his mouth, preparing. Creeper felt a position of power. "SsssssSSSS" Creeper exclaimed as he explod-
[14:24] <Demki> Vede, it's theme is medieval fantasy
[14:25] <GaKo> Shrub, I lol'd. HARD.
[14:25] <Shrub> Haha.

[14:25] <Shrub> Everyone knows Minecraft is lego Herculoids.
[14:25] <vede> Demki, I don't see how "medieval fantasy" and "average children's show" can really be too far apart.
[14:26] <vede> Mash them together and you've got Minecraft.
[14:26] <vede> Fuh-sho.
[14:26] <Shrub> My average children's show involves people in a playhouse talking to me

[14:43] <Shadaez> bildramer go drink some mayonnaise

[14:43] <vede> Visiiri, so fiction that's entirely unrelated apart from the fact that, say, it takes place in the same 'universe' is fan-fiction?
[14:43] <bildramer> lol
[14:43] <Foe> bildramer, I need to gain weight too :l
[14:43] <Shrub> Depends if it's published or not

[14:44] <Visiiri> If the universe is THE SAME UNIVERSE
[14:44] <Shadaez> milk chocolate may be

[15:01] <Shrub> what?
[15:01] <Kaan> it's in the terms and conditions

[18:04] <Nunu> Thank you serow. :) This was what I was after.
[18:04] <Diablodoct0r> guys
[18:04] <Nunu> vede, I could use mspaint for this, but I prefer the skinmaker.
[18:04] <Diablodoct0r> I have a request
[18:04] <Serow> I have it bookmarked to check for updates. XD
[18:04] <Diablodoct0r> There is a game I'm looking for,
[18:04] <Diablodoct0r> I forgot the name and link
[18:04] <Diablodoct0r> But I remember all in-game aspects
[18:04] <vurtual> I use paint.net
[18:04] <vurtual> because layers let me try alternate styles on something
[18:04] <vurtual> like recoloring some piece of clothing
[18:04] <vurtual> or adding lighting effects
[18:05] <Diablodoct0r> It's 2D, view from above, shooter (use your mouse to control your aim, WASD to walk), there's a level editor/item editor, etc etc
[18:05] <vurtual> by darkening most of the texture except the lit parts/brightening the lit parts
[18:05] <Diablodoct0r> There are underwater subs, tanks, even a "Doom Tank" that is extremely strong
[18:05] <Nunu> Hmm...
[18:05] <vurtual> You reminded me of some FPS I had played made in Shockwave
[18:05] <Nunu> is it like a flash game?
[18:05] <Diablodoct0r> Later in the game, I advance to bases in Space, and can use Mechs inside the spaceship
[18:05] <vurtual> I was playing against bots and it was kinda funny, I was sniping people
[18:05] <Diablodoct0r> No, it's a full downloadable game
[18:05] <vurtual> years later, yeaars
[18:06] <Shrub> Graphics Style?
[18:06] <Diablodoct0r> Uh, Tiles
[18:06] <vurtual> I bump into the game on some must-play list(that was hillariously bad), with a screenshot of people sniping from that same position
[18:06] <vurtual> it was like "WOAH"
[18:06] <Diablodoct0r> 2D, very simple
[18:06] <Diablodoct0r> You can edit tiles if you want
[18:06] <vede> vurtual, surely you're not trying to say that layering is a rare feature or something.
[18:06] <vurtual> vede
[18:06] <vurtual> the point being it's not paint
[18:06] <Bodie> so guys, i was standing in a tree, left for a bit, came back
[18:06] <Bodie> and check the pigs out
[18:06] <Bodie> http://minechan.isgreat.org/m/src/127902997128.png
[18:06] <vurtual> and also not something lame like gimp
[18:06] <vurtual> Grand Theft Auto, Diablodoct0r?
[18:06] <Diablodoct0r> No
[18:06] <Diablodoct0r> Different game
[18:06] <Bodie> the pigs totally wanna be me
[18:06] <Diablodoct0r> You're some kinda agent
[18:07] <Diablodoct0r> You can ride cars, helicopters, vehicles you name it
[18:07] <Diablodoct0r> Underwater subs..
[18:07] <Diablodoct0r> Even a hoverboard
[18:07] <Diablodoct0r> And you collect Green / Yellow / Red / Blue keys I think

[19:34] <Visiiri> Yeah!

[19:34] <sorre> just like most electronics in australia
[19:34] <Hunter712> The instructions for Damascus might be lost, but it doesn't mean notch can't get creative

[19:35] <SuperLlama> and a ton of new monters
[19:35] <Shadowarrier> Hey guys!
[19:35] <SuperLlama> and each area had its own textures and monsters

[19:36] <SuperLlama> nobody insults as well as Glados.
[19:36] <SuperLlama> There was even going to be a party for you. A big party. And all your friends were invited. I even invited your best friend the companion cube, but he couldn't come because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other friends, because of how unlikable you are. It says so right here in your personnel file: unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner, whose pas
[19:36] <SuperLlama> sing shall NOT be mourned. Shall Not Be Mourned. That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted, so that's funny too.

[20:00] <bildramer> there should be Leisure Suit Larry-like questions
[20:00] <bildramer> lol
[20:00] <SuperLlama> I'd say they should have to pass a typing test in order to use voice chat
[20:00] <SuperLlama> if they can't type, they shouldn't talk either.

[20:02] <SuperLlama> I know some ancient greek
[20:02] <SuperLlama> well, koine
[20:02] <Firetempest> maybe facial recondition from those camera add-ons too. You are not tall enough to play this game.
[20:02] <ClassiestMedic> A greek geek!

[20:03] <SuperLlama> Lol
[20:03] <SuperLlama> not quite ancient
[20:04] <SuperLlama> I can read koine greek
[20:04] <SuperLlama> can't write it very well though
[20:04] <bildramer> so, problem #1: even most adults can't do math
[20:04] <bildramer> actually, that's a nice idea, measuring height
[20:04] <SuperLlama> koine greek was around 1st century

[20:04] <SuperLlama> just make them do a typing test
[20:04] <bildramer> they can google
[20:04] <SuperLlama> no a dictated one
[20:05] <SuperLlama> read a long paragraph
[20:05] <bildramer> kids are unfortunate being teached to circumvent tests
[20:05] <SuperLlama> and if they dont' type it right
[20:05] <bildramer> oh rofl
[20:05] <SuperLlama> then "you're too stupid to voice chat'

[20:10] <CyborgDragon> , width length 16, height/depth(whichever you want to call it) is 128
[20:10] <bildramer> because, you know, the majority is so fucking stupid.
[20:10] <EmpiresBane> loading entire columns at once is actually a good idea

[20:12] <CyborgDragon> i read what you were saying copyboy as i was typing, xD
[20:12] <bildramer> it's 20 bits
[20:12] <copyboy> yeah, and that too
[20:12] <bildramer> and what are you going to do?
[20:12] <EmpiresBane> a byte for a lighting
[20:12] <EmpiresBane> ok
[20:12] <copyboy> nope, half a byte
[20:12] <EmpiresBane> i see what you meant
[20:12] <copyboy> :P
[20:12] <CyborgDragon> yes a byte for block type, a byte for someything else, a nibble for blocklight and skylight
[20:12] <EmpiresBane> Eric, yeah

[20:24] <bildramer> what am I doing wrong?
[20:24] <Aeomin> layla already gave a hint
[20:24] <SuperLlama> fail, unity engine
[20:24] <bildramer> I'm culling back faces, I only view outermost blocks...
[20:24] <Aeomin> don't render faces that is hidden (between 2 cubes)
[20:24] <bildramer> right
[20:24] <bildramer> that's so easy, you know
[20:25] <bildramer> if I sat down for half an hour I could figure it out
[20:25] <Aeomin> and use vertex array
[20:25] <bildramer> but meh
[20:25] <CyborgDragon> speaking of culling, if you spill water on top of ice then remove said water, the culled faces of the ice blocks show up
[20:25] <CyborgDragon> it's really annoying
[20:25] <bildramer> it's open-source, you can all fix it
[20:25] <SuperLlama> LOl
[20:25] <Kokopure> CyborgDragon, what now?
[20:25] <commandoviper> their needs to be an option to make it a snow level

[20:25] <SuperLlama> it has gmod in it.
[20:25] <Kokopure> "culled faces"?
[20:26] <copyboy> fuck this, i'm playing tf2
[20:26] <CyborgDragon> kokopure, culling means to not render faces you cant see
[20:27] <bildramer> so
[20:27] <Kokopure> O_o so if you spill water on top of ice and take the water off
[20:27] <Kokopure> what happens?

[20:30] <CyborgDragon> vlc doesnt cut off a half second for me

[20:30] <SuperLlama> I almost think it's better :P

[20:31] <SuperLlama> http://3dnes.blogspot.com/
[20:31] <SuperLlama> yeah
[20:31] <SuperLlama> my older brother used to play Zelda II all the time when I was little kid
[20:31] <CyborgDragon> it wasnt the best zelda, but zelda ii was still a zelda is indeed still great
[20:31] <Firetempest> he only made up to the first boss as a project

[20:31] * DimJim is now known as DimJim|napsleep

[20:31] <EmpiresBane> and i love majoras mask
[20:31] <SuperLlama> yeah
[20:31] <SuperLlama> that was awesome

[20:32] <CyborgDragon> i understood what the hell was going on when i was 6, xD
[20:32] <SuperLlama> Link's Awakening was a great story
[20:32] <SuperLlama> but it was so sad
[20:32] <EmpiresBane> i don't like OOT as much because i think i got stuck permanantly
[20:32] <lenox> oh yeah
[20:32] <SuperLlama> wind fish :'(
[20:32] <CyborgDragon> and my dad let me play half-life and quake 2 at 8
[20:32] <EmpiresBane> iand i don't want to restart
[20:32] <lenox> links awakening was great
[20:32] <SuperLlama> yeah, I don't like OOT because i never owned an n64
[20:32] <SuperLlama> and all emulators I try it on can't play it fast enough
[20:32] <lenox> it blew my mind to play what looked like a snes-quality zelda on gb
[20:32] <SuperLlama> Majora's Mask on the other hand
[20:32] <SuperLlama> runs fine on project64
[20:32] <Firetempest> links awakening was the sad one for me
[20:32] <CyborgDragon> SuperLlama it's not so sad
[20:33] <Monte> <SuperLlama> yeah, I don't like OOT because i never owned an n64 <--

[20:33] <EmpiresBane> well...
[20:33] <SuperLlama> and all emulators run it badly
[20:33] <lenox> it should have been called wind fish's awakening

[20:33] <EmpiresBane> i could respect it for being good

[20:33] <TerraSleet> lol trolls

[20:33] <EmpiresBane> i just didn't like it

[20:33] <SuperLlama> exactly
[20:33] <SuperLlama> nah,
[20:33] <SuperLlama> PJ64 barely runs it for me
[20:33] <CyborgDragon> SuperLlama get a different plugin for n64
[20:34] <SuperLlama> it sound skips
[20:34] <EmpiresBane> get a N64 then
[20:34] <CyborgDragon> or fool around with the settings
[20:34] <EmpiresBane> they're like $20

[20:35] <SuperLlama> those emulators are better than their consolse
[20:35] <SuperLlama> because of fast forward and savestates and things
[20:35] <TerraSleet> the only reason for emulators is to get free games, which in most cases are illegal
[20:35] <SuperLlama> only modern games
[20:35] <SuperLlama> old console games are abandonware
[20:35] <TerraSleet> define modern
[20:35] <SuperLlama> modern meaning they still sell it in stores
[20:35] <bildramer> ...
[20:35] <TerraSleet> 1 year? 5 years? 10 years?
[20:35] <SuperLlama> if gamestop doesn't have it
[20:35] <SuperLlama> it's abandonware
[20:36] <SuperLlama> :P

[20:36] <SuperLlama> well
[20:36] <TerraSleet> top consoles i mean
[20:36] <bildramer> uh
[20:36] <Monte> <SuperLlama> PJ64 barely runs it for me <--your computer sucks

[20:36] <SuperLlama> if you can't find it in a store

[20:36] <SuperLlama> but I can't change that
[20:36] <bildramer> there are other reasons

[20:37] <lenox> it seems like emulators have reduced in quality lately
[20:37] <TerraSleet> ps1 i would consider abandonware, yet it is still under copyright laws
[20:37] <SuperLlama> so it's legal
[20:37] <TerraSleet> lol, one before dreamcast

[20:37] <EmpiresBane> nNa, last friday
[20:37] <SuperLlama> if the company isn't making money off a game anymore

[21:14] <SuperLlama> lol
[21:14] <vurtual> 6, out of a potential 6
[21:14] <Kyle> There is nothing wrong with speedhacks on a creative server, it just makes it easier to build things,but on survival its gonna be a major problem
[21:14] <ClassiestMedic> noclip
[21:14] <ClassiestMedic> speed
[21:14] <rob`> notch hasn't even finished writing the protocol, I doubt speedhacks will work before that :)

[22:51] <Gunmage> facepunch?>
[22:51] <Akai> Rooster. I can top that
[22:51] <Arsonide> I am having a serious problem ever since the snow update that has killed me multiple times. Completely at random, when I walk in a given direction, it doesn't stop walking when I let go of the key until I tap that key again. This has made very tense moments near lava and large drops, and made fighting mobs extremely difficult sometimes when attempting to flee for my life.
[22:51] <Akai> Thanks to the MC Forums aggressive banning style
[22:51] <Akai> "You have been permanently banned from this board. Please contact the Board Administrator for more information. Reason given for ban: Ban evasion. A ban has been issued on your IP address."
[22:52] <Arsonide> It only happens in Minecraft so it isn't a hardware issue, and it hasn't happened until the snow update.
[22:52] <Rooster> It's like time has been added on.
[22:52] <Rooster> I'm pretty sure two admins banned me for the same reason.
[22:52] <Rooster> I demand an explanation.
[22:52] <Gunmage> arson, I sort of got key lock too
[22:52] <Akai> That was my very first connect to MC forums ever from home, too
[22:52] <Akai> only ever time I'd been on before was at our beach house >.<
[22:53] <Arsonide> But it isn't related to snow, because it happens on non-snow maps.
[22:53] <Gunmage> yeah
[22:53] <Rooster> Your keyboard is broken?
[22:53] <Gunmage> A couple of times my pick axe has kept swinging itself
[22:53] <Rooster> and Akai, how do you evade a ban?

[22:53] <Rooster> THAT'S RETARDED
[22:54] <Firetempest> serpentine pattern! ???
[22:54] <Rooster> How old are the admins?

[23:43] <Diablodoct0r> mines are slow
[23:43] <Diablodoct0r> TNT takes ages to explode
[23:43] <Diablodoct0r> unless..
[23:43] <Diablodoct0r> ! IDEA
[23:43] <Diablodoct0r> Make it levelled

[23:44] <Diablodoct0r> if they have to jump a height, they spend time

[23:44] <Diablodoct0r> So in addition to the long river around the house
[23:44] <Diablodoct0r> build stairs
[23:44] <bildramer> uh
[23:44] <bildramer> any 2-block-tall pit is unescapable by mobs
[23:44] <bildramer> except creepers
[23:44] <Diablodoct0r> Yes
[23:44] <bildramer> ugh
[23:44] <bildramer> for players and creepers use obsidian
[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> Creepers don't get out of that either unless they piss themselves
[23:45] <bildramer> lol
[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> PSSS
[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> yeah
[23:45] <bildramer> wait, players can just jump and place block
[23:45] <bildramer> ugh needs creativity

[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> xD
[23:45] <cavemans> hey
[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> They can't place block if they step on TNT
[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> hi
[23:45] <bildramer> sand being released/
[23:45] <bildramer> ?
[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> If there are TNT buttons down there
[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> That 2-block pit is enough time-consuming
[23:45] <bildramer> who cares, I had an other idea
[23:45] <Diablodoct0r> oh?
[23:45] <bildramer> blow up the ceiling, sand falls
[23:46] <bildramer> player dies
[23:46] <Diablodoct0r> niiiice
[23:46] <bildramer> easy to conceal, too
[23:46] <bildramer> except the trigger
[23:46] <Diablodoct0r> Do mobs die of that too?
[23:46] <bildramer> I think so
[23:46] <bildramer> so, for blue color we have diamond blocks
[23:46] <Diablodoct0r> I'll make that trap :D
[23:46] <bildramer> so blue/yellow only
[23:47] <bildramer> heh, red/green colorblinds won't care about our pixels
[23:47] <bildramer> leaves would need extreme planning
[23:47] <bildramer> mossy cobble would need luck
[23:47] <bildramer> so no green
[23:47] <bildramer> TNT or bricks for red
[23:48] <bildramer> brb testing
[23:48] <bildramer> oh hey
[23:48] <bildramer> now I can actually use my editor for something
[23:48] <bildramer> :D
