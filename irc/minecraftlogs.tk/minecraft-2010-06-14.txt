[0:23] <Visiiri> and I even know binary
[0:23] <Azathoth> should just be x<length

[0:24] <blaster> Osdev, whats this, a minecraft opperating system
[0:24] <sllide> ah..
[0:24] <Azathoth> not minecraft, blaster
[0:25] <sllide> damn i should learn c sometime

[0:26] <TkTech> sllide: You need to read the beginner mistakes on the wiki
[0:26] <Dragoon> Oh my god Notch is a true bro
[0:26] <TkTech> Then learn C and assembly and try again in 5 years
[0:26] <sllide> hah
[0:26] <Azathoth> aren't there default libraries that can do that stuff?
[0:27] <Dragoon> I've found a vein of over 20 silver above ground
[0:27] <TkTech> Azathoth: They aren't available in a kernel.
[0:27] <gordenfreechmen> wow whee! SILVER!
[0:27] <sllide> Azathoth, there are no libraries in os development

[0:46] <Kokopure> however
[0:46] <Rooster> make a tower
[0:46] <Kokopure> if you've got coal/wood to burn
[0:46] <Kokopure> you could always turn it into Stone and make a snazzy tower.
[0:46] <Kokopure> oh speaking of which
[0:46] <Turnip199> But I dunno how to decorate D:
[0:46] <Kokopure> Didn't Notch say a while ago he'd make a super-tough block?

[0:54] <Cial> zombies cant climb ladders correct?
[0:54] <Noah> no mob can.
[0:54] <vurtual> Along with a weird bearded poleaxe, and a knight who has way too many weapons, they can finally fight the skeletons properly
[0:54] <Noah> no mob can open doors either.

[1:01] <Evicous> Because I'm pretty sure it is.
[1:01] <Cial> fucking lag
[1:01] <gordenfreechmen> you know
[1:01] <blaster> Its grappling a cocritrice

[1:01] <gordenfreechmen> a little wooden one

[1:01] <gordenfreechmen> cant believe its still alive
[1:01] <gordenfreechmen> after 2-3 days

[1:04] <vurtual> yeah
[1:04] <Kodaichi> didn't press a button, though
[1:04] <vurtual> an int save?
[1:04] <SireTRM> DnD? I don't think so for Charisma.
[1:04] <gordenfreechmen> yeah, i'll put that on a cobblestone podium
[1:04] <SireTRM> Str, Dex, Int have saves, I think.

[1:04] <SireTRM> Let me check my char sheet
[1:04] <vurtual> str con and wis
[1:05] <vurtual> because this guy has a feat for bonus base AC and a +1 on every save, and I wrote down saves for str, int, and cha.
[1:05] <gordenfreechmen> i was gonna attempt to my tower falling jump
[1:05] <vurtual> er
[1:05] <vurtual> dex con and wis
[1:05] <SireTRM> No.
[1:05] <vurtual> derp
[1:05] <gordenfreechmen> but then i realized im carrying my first pickaxe
[1:05] <gordenfreechmen> so that'd be a bad idea
[1:05] <gordenfreechmen> if i didnt succeed
[1:05] <SireTRM> Ok, sec.
[1:05] <SireTRM> Con, Dex, Wis saves.
[1:05] <vurtual> yeah I know
[1:06] <vurtual> but I'm wondering why I even wrote down bonuses to saves for those other scores, hmm
[1:06] <Cial> who wants to see the outside of my base?
[1:06] <SireTRM> I presume that there are non-standard throws that are similar to saves.
[1:06] <vurtual> yeah there's stuff like that
[1:06] <gordenfreechmen> my pickaxe is either 1 or 2 uses from being destroyed
[1:06] <gordenfreechmen> not gonna take the risk
[1:06] <vurtual> bar empty?
[1:06] <vurtual> empty bar means 1
[1:06] <vurtual> always

[1:06] <vurtual> it's close enough
[1:06] <gordenfreechmen> its not an empty bar
[1:06] <gordenfreechmen> its like 2
[1:07] <vurtual> just bury it
[1:07] <vurtual> with some integrity
[1:07] * sllide (sllide@ip565eb113.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft
[1:07] <vurtual> I guess a STR save would be like "Don't fail some continous task that requires physical force"
[1:07] <SireTRM> And empty bar means it doesn't produce the item bonus required to, say, mine coal.
[1:07] <vurtual> Like if you're holding up something
[1:07] <Cyrex> Am I the only person that have mines infront of their base?
[1:07] <SireTRM> Which is, essentially, just a Str roll.
[1:07] <Cyrex> connected with cloth as a fuse
[1:07] <gordenfreechmen> heh. out of cobblestone
[1:07] <SireTRM> Umm, probably.
[1:07] <gordenfreechmen> gonna have to make some more

[1:51] <Aldrenean> how so
[1:51] <vurtual> how many feet do you think a horse could move in 6 seconds?
[1:51] <thechris> clear out underneath were you want the light so lava is directly below, and place sand were you want it
[1:51] <vurtual> if a person in light or medium armor is 30ft

[1:54] <vurtual> suffix is "ft.", it's about 12 inches, one third of a yard, rouuughly one third of a metter, and has been in use for ages

[1:54] <Kokopure> ne'ermind
[1:54] <Cial> under a thread called Cartographer i think
[1:54] <Kokopure> I just searched my History for Cartographer
[1:54] <vurtual> what DOES D&D say for this
[1:54] <Cyrex> isn't there a way to edit infdev maps?
[1:55] <Cial> NBTforge ?
[1:55] <vurtual> "light warhorse" goes 60ft
[1:55] <vurtual> I'll go with 50 then
[1:56] <Aldrenean> That's not a realistic estiamte, but I suppose it makes sense for balance
[1:56] <vurtual> in 6 seconds
[1:56] <vurtual> that's 10 feet a second
[1:56] <vurtual> as opposed to 15 feet in a second
[1:56] <vurtual> which would be a blindingly fast horse
[1:57] <vurtual> 1% of a supersonic horse
[1:57] <Aldrenean> 15 feet/second is only 10 MPH
[1:57] <Aldrenean> horses gallop at 25
[1:57] <vurtual> yeah but this isn't a gallop
[1:57] <Aldrenean> Haha, okay, but even a canter is 17mph
[1:57] <vurtual> there's rules you use for when you are like, in open terrain and going intentionally fast
[1:58] <Snowman> Use a real speed
[1:58] <Dysgalt> Olawdy
[1:58] <Snowman> k/h
[1:58] <Aldrenean> and a horse can definitely negotiate obstacles at 17mph
[1:58] <Snowman> km/h*
[1:58] <Dysgalt> half a million blocks queued up on my server
[1:58] <Aldrenean> I tried and they yelled at me!
[1:58] <vurtual> and I don't think a horse could gallop while running between winding ruins
[1:58] <Aldrenean> I agree with you
[1:58] <vurtual> in OBLIVION* BRAND HORSE ARMOR!
[1:58] <Aldrenean> I wasn't saying galloping speed
[1:58] <rob`> in minecraft, m/sec is probably more useful
[1:58] <rob`> since a human runs about 2m/sec
[1:58] <Aldrenean> I was giving a fast canter speed, which seems reasonable

[2:01] <vurtual> or just find its wing
[2:01] <Turnip> I mean neam
[2:01] <Turnip> Name
[2:01] <Aldrenean> yeah, calculate the wingspan
[2:01] <Turnip> What shouold I name my mountain

[2:04] <Aldrenean> haha I don't even know what we're talking about now.
[2:04] <Turnip> Chess has no numbers? D:
[2:04] <vurtual> this is like chess

[2:04] * Zwolf11 (dark-drago@d47-69-10-28.col.wideopenwest.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[2:04] <Turnip> But chess has no numbers to start out with?
[2:04] <Aldrenean> like the grid numbers?
[2:05] <vurtual> chess is fairly mathematical and comprehendable
[2:05] <Turnip> oic
[2:05] <vurtual> but this is not that
[2:05] <Aldrenean> ...
[2:05] <vurtual> Wizard unit can unleash massive damage because of acid arrow and magic missile and the fact that it can summon an anvil at enemies, but has low AC...
[2:05] <vurtual> my fighter can easily kill everything, but he'd be swarmed by 3 units at once.
[2:05] <Aldrenean> K I think that's all numbers
[2:05] <Aldrenean> much more so than in chess
[2:05] <Aldrenean> so what are you talking about
[2:05] <vurtual> I have created some kind of half-wargaming system using D&D 3.5e rules.

[2:07] <vurtual> this is more than just a finite-result, well-studied system like chess
[2:07] <Turnip> So, if no one else has suggestions, that the mountain will be called Mt. Destiny
[2:07] <Aldrenean> Buuuuhhhh
[2:07] <vurtual> Mt. Silver
[2:07] <vurtual> call the base either silver cave, or dark cave
[2:07] <vurtual> or have two, dark cave and silver cave

[3:14] <vurtual> Even the D&D creator was a kid on the inside, man.
[3:14] <MercMan> Why the hell does cobblestone go back to SOLID ROCK when you smelt it?
[3:14] <ZaxKellens> ...
[3:14] <vurtual> he read stuff, from books
[3:14] <ZaxKellens> Oh yeah?
[3:14] <Icenisse> CAUSE NOTCH FELT LIKE IT
[3:14] <gordenfreechmen> mercman: it melts together?
[3:14] <ZaxKellens> Well, Michael Jackson wanted to be inside a kid
[3:14] <Icenisse> AND ITS HIS GAME
[3:14] <Azathoth> having an imagination is not something unique to children
[3:14] <ZaxKellens> I lost the game
[3:14] <Icenisse> thats what he said
[3:14] <MercMan> Lol.
[3:14] <Icenisse> I WON the game
[3:14] <vurtual> it pretty much is nowadays
[3:14] <gordenfreechmen> Azathoth: this.
[3:14] <vurtual> unless you have this so called kid on the inside
[3:14] <Turnip199> Virtual why did you make me nostalgia?
[3:14] <Azathoth> well that's bullshit, vurtual
[3:14] <ZaxKellens> Oh, it's me trying that glitch that's making infdev run so crappy
[3:15] <gordenfreechmen> vurtual: pregnant women arent the only people with imaginations
[3:15] <Azathoth> lol
[3:15] <vurtual> Takes a certain amount of kid to handle playing a game using only rules you voluntary subscribe to, but don't have to, and the only graphics being in your mind
[3:15] <rob`> it'd be nice if you could smelt dirt into bricks
[3:15] <vurtual> hah
[3:15] <MercMan> Yeah
[3:15] <ZaxKellens> It'd be nice if you could have bricks, yes
[3:15] <Azathoth> i agree with rob`
[3:15] <gordenfreechmen> rob`: i think its planned
[3:15] <MercMan> Or, bricks could be like...
[3:15] <MercMan> Hmm.
[3:15] <vurtual> and a certain amount of nerd AND kid to create a wargaming environment using legos
[3:15] * Azathoth sexes rob
[3:15] <MercMan> Maybe some form of sand/dirt
[3:15] * rob` sets Azathoth on fire.
[3:15] <MercMan> It could be like, clay
[3:15] <Azathoth> D:
[3:15] <gordenfreechmen> yeah, clay
[3:15] <ZaxKellens> Bricks should be Sand and Stone
[3:15] <MercMan> Clay could yield bricks
[3:16] <vurtual> I was gonna have this knight dismount from this horse and have him fight with a sword, but his lance is killing everything.
[3:16] <ZaxKellens> Stone X, Sand everything else
[3:16] <ZaxKellens> =brick
[3:16] <rob`> I agree, but lacking clay, dirt is pretty close. Maybe dirt+water somehow.
[3:16] <vurtual> no no get dirt
[3:16] <vurtual> refine it into clay

[3:16] <ZaxKellens> ...
[3:16] <vurtual> or mine clay in the random thick amounts udnerground
[3:16] <ZaxKellens> vurtual : Do you know what clay is made of?
[3:16] <rob`> or you stand in the water and turn 2 dirt blocks into a clay block?
[3:16] <MercMan> Dirt.
[3:16] <vurtual> it's a kinda dirt
[3:17] <vurtual> I remember this from my oldest dog getting buried
[3:17] <ZaxKellens> It's fine grained minerals that react well with water
[3:17] <MercMan> Like, dirt, water, and random shit
[3:17] <vurtual> he was older than me.
[3:17] <ZaxKellens> Allowing the water to be held in the material
[3:17] <vurtual> ;_;
[3:17] <MercMan> Yes
[3:17] <ZaxKellens> Dirt and Clay are a huge difference o.o
[3:17] <MercMan> ROFL. I just put a torch in shallow water, now my water is like, dividing by zero.

[3:18] <MercMan> If mud could be made.
[3:18] <ZaxKellens> Brb, I'mma test this underwater torch thing
[3:18] <vurtual> then build a kiln structure, or just a furnace I guess, and fire it into individual bricks, make mortar from I dunno where(where do they get mortar? Dept stores? I don't know.), then while having mortar and bricks, use a trowel to build bricks on the spot
[3:18] <MercMan> Underwater Torches= Beast
[3:18] <vurtual> 9 bricks=1 block
[3:18] <vurtual> or use bricks as bars for... I dunno

[3:18] <Dragoon> lol
[3:18] <ZaxKellens> I hate underwater anyway, I can't see =\

[3:23] <vurtual> that would be scary

[3:23] <vurtual> tidal magma

[3:24] <EmpiresBane> Kodaichi, i beat that game and i haven't even seen world 7 yet
[3:24] <Animator> Silly vurtual. One cannot simply burn into Mordor.
[3:24] <ZaxKellens> that would be so awesome...
[3:24] <EmpiresBane> i only played about half the thing
[3:24] <Dragoon> I hope we can have infhell
[3:25] <Dragoon> That'd be awesome
[3:25] <vurtual> Kodaichi what happened with mini mushroom
[3:25] <Kodaichi> it does the same thing
[3:25] <vurtual> going by what notch said
[3:25] <ZaxKellens> Bwhahaha
[3:25] <Kodaichi> just slows you down
[3:25] <vurtual> it'll be a plane of existance
[3:25] <vurtual> potentially parallel with ours
[3:25] <vurtual> using a similar generation algorithm, so the general layout might be the same!
[3:25] <EmpiresBane> also lets you float a bit and run on water
[3:25] <ZaxKellens> vurtual plays pokemon! o.o
[3:25] <quiggle> nope i tried wood and planks on stone
[3:25] <vurtual> what
[3:25] <Icenisse> >_>
[3:25] <vurtual> how did you notice
[3:25] <ZaxKellens> Lol
[3:25] <Icenisse> you have to make a crafting table
[3:25] <quiggle> i cannot get any stone to give me a piece
[3:26] <vurtual> so you become a humped by an equally tiny goomba, Kodaichi?
[3:26] <Icenisse> and make a pickaxe
[3:26] <Kodaichi> empiresbane, we're talking about mini musgroom + mini goomba
[3:26] <quiggle> yeah i did that
[3:26] <ZaxKellens> Because you like Pokabu
[3:26] <Icenisse> with sticks
[3:26] <Icenisse> sticks!
[3:26] <EmpiresBane> oh

[3:26] <quiggle> how many sticks?
[3:26] <Kodaichi> oops.
[3:26] <Icenisse> you need two
[3:26] <Kodaichi> not a musgroom.

[3:40] <Koko|dinner> they don't
[3:40] <ZaxKellens> Drat
[3:40] <Koko|dinner> but should they? it's a common suggestion
[3:40] <EmpiresBane> no they shouldn't
[3:40] <crazyspai> So, Demannu Networks is becoming more popular.
[3:40] <EmpiresBane> i like being able to stand next to lava
[3:40] <vurtual> I don't get how people try to diet by jsut eating less
[3:40] <ZaxKellens> Demannu Networks?
[3:41] <vurtual> do you eat a small slice or a medium slice and some celery so it cancels out fff
[3:41] <ZaxKellens> vurtual : Diets are stupid
[3:41] <crazyspai> vurtual: My diet is eat less but more often.
[3:41] <vurtual> this is supposed ot make sense?
[3:41] <EmpiresBane> vurtual, it works if you eat a shitload
[3:41] <vurtual> My diet is "eat food."
[3:41] <ZaxKellens> My diet is I eat what I want, when I want
[3:41] <vurtual> I dunno what that food will be
[3:41] <crazyspai> ZaxKellens: It's my MC server hosting service.
[3:41] <vurtual> but sometimes it's bacon
[3:41] <vurtual> mmm, bacon
[3:41] <SireTRM> Mmm. Waffles.
[3:41] <EmpiresBane> eating less but more often does work
[3:41] <EmpiresBane> it'll just take a year
[3:41] <vurtual> eating lots of food works
[3:41] <crazyspai> vurtual: Since I exercise a lot, instead of eating 3 times. I'll eat 6-7 times. But smaller portions
[3:41] <EmpiresBane> but it's also healthier
[3:41] <vurtual> plenty of meat and potato and country food
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> I had some bacon today
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> On a salad
[3:42] <vurtual> "smaller portions" won't help
[3:42] <vurtual> it will hurt.
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> With cheese and Catalina dressing
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> It was delicious

[3:42] <vurtual> well probably nowhere near as the people who just don't eat at all almost so they can lose weight
[3:42] <vurtual> then their body is like "must stooore fooood :("
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Yep
[3:42] <EmpiresBane> but
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Then anything they eat becomes fat
[3:42] * laCour is now known as laCour|Offline
[3:43] <SireTRM> Eating "n" amount of food over 6 or 7 single times of the day is better than "n" over 2 or 3 meals.
[3:43] <vurtual> how is it better?
[3:43] <EmpiresBane> dumb steam
[3:43] <EmpiresBane> vurtual, because your body doesn't have to deal with as much at once
[3:43] <vurtual> okay, so you have a number, it'll either be 1d4 6 times, or 2d4 3 times, but the rolls will always be the same
[3:44] <vurtual> then it subtracts
[3:44] <vurtual> over time
[3:44] <quiggle> still not able to get any ore, rock or anything
[3:44] <EmpiresBane> also, because of the gaps between meals, your body starts to store it as fat
[3:44] <quiggle> i have wood, sticks and raw wood
[3:44] <vurtual> which will result in a lower number? Not the 1d4 many times, at least.
[3:44] <EmpiresBane> ...
[3:44] <vurtual> I don't have any fat on me
[3:44] <vurtual> okay a tiny bit. maybe.
[3:44] <ZaxKellens> Hell Island is fun
[3:44] <EmpiresBane> vurtual, food isn't D&D
[3:44] <vurtual> It's genetic, honestly.
[3:44] <SireTRM> You need three planks and two sticks to mine rock

[5:02] <ZaxKellens> She likes manga too
[5:03] <Dude000> and then i realized
[5:03] <SireTRM> You cannot judge someone by what the like in media.
[5:03] <Dude000> >implying you don't need clothes
[5:03] <vurtual> Chuck Norris, despite any "overusedness", is infact a very hardcore warrior
[5:03] <Dude000> yes you can
[5:03] <vurtual> who, despite any potentially unlikable religious side, will easily take anyone down
[5:03] <ZaxKellens> Chuck Norris is a weak
[5:03] <SireTRM> Well, you cannot judge someones sexuality by the genera of content they prefer.
[5:03] <ZaxKellens> =O
[5:03] <Dude000> genre
[5:04] <vurtual> ZaxKellens, have you even seen him fight
[5:04] <vurtual> He has his own martial art
[5:04] <ZaxKellens> I know
[5:04] <SireTRM> You mean modern visual media special effects for live actors?
[5:04] <ZaxKellens> Bruce Lee > Chuck Norris
[5:05] <vurtual> bruce lee won one fight against chuck once
[5:05] <vurtual> now what happened to him?

[5:09] <vurtual> the science channel has a show on right now about wether a creator exists
[5:09] <vurtual> Morgan Freeman is narrating it, and it's not horrendeously biased or anything!
[5:09] <vurtual> It's like... God narrating about God, though.

[5:32] <Dude000> did your internet break

[5:33] <Perry> I stopped being lazy and FINALLY downloaded firefox and abandoned IE.
[5:33] <atung323> yep
[5:33] <Dude000> thus ports are forwarded
[5:33] <Dude000> hurrrrrrrrr

[5:33] <vurtual> with this part of the mind
[5:33] <Obtuse_goose> That was the best reaction ever
[5:33] <atung323> and i had the server running fine the last 3 months or so
[5:34] <vurtual> so outside of yourself
[5:34] <Shadaez> People being able to connect, then not, then able to, again, seems like it could have been UPnP messing around, and not having the ports forwarded

[6:25] <vurtual> create a wood ring, which should end roughly around the grass level, with 2x2 space inside
[6:25] <vurtual> place double door

[6:27] <Pangogie> Hello people =]
[6:27] <Darke> I need help with my surver
[6:27] <Keiya> Risk to the player, but not so much that you don't want to build major constructions because they'll just get bombed.
[6:27] <Darke> I dont know if I'm doing the surver properties right
[6:27] <Dragoon> Someone should skin sheep into bears
[6:27] <Dragoon> That'd be awesome
[6:27] <Darke> Creepers should be removed impo
[6:27] <Darke> imo
[6:27] <Dragoon> Well fuck your shit.
[6:27] <gordenfreechmen> everyone would be upset
[6:27] <Darke> Who would?

[6:28] <Darke> All creepers do is destroy your hard to create structures
[6:28] <ZarroTsu> then kill them
[6:28] <Dragoon> Point?
[6:28] <Dude000> if my versus mode idea that i have yet to post anywhere actually ends up in the game somehow
[6:28] <Keiya> Maybe if creepers only appeared on Hard?
[6:28] <ZarroTsu> lazy shizz
[6:28] <gordenfreechmen> minus skeletons TWUNG, it removes heart attacks
[6:28] <rob`> tructures aren't really hard to create, and they don't go off if you're not directly net to them
[6:28] <Keiya> And, they'd be less annoying in multiplayer.
[6:29] <Keiya> Because you either have allies, or you're not expecting your structures to last anyway
[6:29] <vurtual> until notch adds chickens
[6:29] <Dragoon> They wouldn't be that bad in MP because it would be more than one PC against the creeper
[6:29] <vurtual> he should add crossbows

[6:30] <vurtual> firing could be "hold mouse2 for a moment(press to toggle?), crossbow goes off screen, comes up a 3D voxel thing in view, new crossbow crosshair, fire with mouse button"
[6:30] <vurtual> infact that'd be an awesome way to use weapons
[6:31] <vurtual> and advanced objects in general
[6:31] <Keiya> But yeah. For the moment at least, making creepers appear on Hard only, would make me not want to play only on Peaceful >_>
[6:31] <Kokopure> Are you talking about scopes?
[6:31] <vurtual> no, readying a weapon

[6:33] <Keiya> and not just for crossbow weapons
[6:33] <vurtual> what
[6:33] <Keiya> Or do you mean crosshair?
[6:33] <vurtual> crosshair
[6:33] <vurtual> for a crossbow

[6:34] <Darke> I would LOVE to see adjustable sights
[6:34] <vurtual> I'm talking this: Things like more complex weapons(that you can't just swing, stab, or fling in someone's general direction) would be readied by selecting them and holding them, then hitting mouse2, and you'll have equipped them
[6:34] * Shadox (Shadox@97-91-222-150.dhcp.stls.mo.charter.com) has joined #minecraft
[6:34] <Dude000> like what
[6:34] <vurtual> a weapon like a crossbow could have adjustable sights or whatever based on how you craft it(want to spend the resources for adding that?), designed to make it easy to aim
[6:35] <Dude000> i'm pretty sure every weapon can go under swing stab or fling
[6:35] <vurtual> and you could have the quickbar give you options about the weapon
[6:35] <liq3> lol...goodluck getting sights in a fantasy setting.
[6:35] <liq3> :P
[6:35] <vurtual> crossbows have sights sometimes
[6:35] <vurtual> even bows can have sights!
[6:35] <vurtual> Sucky bows.
[6:35] <liq3> yes, but a fantasy setting.
[6:35] <Dude000> a sight can be a piece of wood
[6:35] <vurtual> crossbows in fantasy settings too can have sights
[6:35] <Dragoon> Maaaaagoc
[6:35] <liq3> They didn't have steel incased glass lenses back then.
[6:35] <liq3> :P
[6:35] <vurtual> ...
[6:35] <Dude000> like ironsights except wood
[6:35] <vurtual> a sight.
[6:35] <vurtual> ironsights.
[6:35] <vurtual> ye olde "ironsights"
[6:35] <Dude000> exactly
[6:36] <liq3> they didn't have ironsights back then.
[6:36] <Kokopure> Heh :3
[6:36] <vurtual> yes they did.
[6:36] <EmpiresBane> or just a liitle peg
[6:36] <Dragoon> They had glass, though.
[6:36] <liq3> Not ones that let you scope.
[6:36] <vurtual> It's a pretty simple concept
[6:36] <vurtual> ...ironsights are for physically pointing the weapon
[6:36] <Kokopure> Question
[6:36] <EmpiresBane> liq3, SIGHTS not SCOPES
[6:36] <Darke> liq3, they could easily craft iron sights
[6:36] * Psywing (psywing@99-60-154-250.lightspeed.elpstx.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[6:36] <Kokopure> Notch said earlier
[6:36] <liq3> vurtual: that's not a scope.
[6:36] <liq3> durp.
[6:36] <liq3> You can't adjust a sight.
[6:36] <Ronjoe> bows have sights. not scopes
[6:36] <Kokopure> That skellies would no longer drop arrows...
[6:36] <vurtual> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_sights
[6:36] <Kokopure> Eventually
[6:36] <Ronjoe> </argument>
[6:36] <Kokopure> So...
[6:36] <vurtual> I said SIGHT
[6:36] <vurtual> adjustable sights do exist
[6:36] <Ronjoe> now
[6:37] <vurtual> if you've played your call of duty modern halo of war
[6:37] <Darke> vurtual never said scope
[6:37] <Kokopure> Did he say what skellies -would- eventually drop?
[6:37] <Dragoon> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=14264 Someone pleeeeease make me a JC Denton skiiiin
[6:37] <liq3> you don't need adjustable sights? :?
[6:37] <Ronjoe> why are we letting a troll bother us?
[6:37] <Darke> liq3, but why not?
[6:37] <vurtual> then you might see it on a rocket launcher
[6:37] <liq3> why would you ?
[6:37] <Darke> I would love to see some more advanced weapony
[6:37] <Darke> weaponry
[6:37] <Dragoon> Skeletons should drop bows
[6:37] <vurtual> there'd be a tiny knob, and that would move a metal bit up or down
[6:37] <Darke> Because it would be fun
[6:37] <liq3> they're to line the weapon up, that's it. :/
[6:37] <Darke> exctly
[6:37] <liq3> they don't need to be adjusted after they're set.

[6:37] <vurtual> for things that fall far, they do

[6:37] <Darke> liq3, adjusted for different distances
[6:37] * Ghost is now known as Varriount
[6:37] <liq3> what?
[6:37] <LuciferZ> Or at least ignore armor bonuses
[6:37] <rob`> even crappy bows have sights. Usually you just stick a pin along the arrow rest somewhere
[6:37] <vurtual> using numbers on it, you could set it for the estimated distance infront of you, then not have to deal with things like aiming up or down the target
[6:38] <liq3> how does moving a metal notch adjust it for a different distance?
[6:38] <Darke> It moves the sight
[6:38] <rob`> the expensive bows have builtin sights
[6:38] <vurtual> up or down
[6:38] <gordenfreechmen> what if minecraft had engravings
[6:38] <gordenfreechmen> like in dwarf fortress
[6:38] <Darke> Making it point at a different spot
[6:38] <Ronjoe> Bow sights work differently
[6:38] <Darke> So?
[6:38] <Ronjoe> look them up already
[6:38] <Darke> It's a game
[6:38] <vurtual> if the sight is physically lower, then you have to point the barrel/pointed thing up or down to make the sights line up right
[6:38] <Darke> Nobody cares about realism
[6:38] <Ronjoe> instead of trolling a game channel
[6:38] <Darke> Ronjoe, please learn what trolling is
[6:38] <Darke> We are having a discussion
[6:38] <liq3> oh so we're talking about non-guns. :/
[6:38] <vurtual> in minecraft terms, controlling this would allow you to have a HUD crosshair move up or down, so you can aim with the screen center
[6:38] <Ronjoe> i came on in the middle of it
[6:38] <Dragoon> All yall shaddup
[6:39] <Darke> liq3, we are talking about crossbows!
[6:39] <Ronjoe> sorry
[6:39] <vurtual> guns, not-guns, waffles, whatever
[6:39] <liq3> well yeh sights would be fine. :/

[6:39] <rob`> the cross in the centre of the screen is adequate
[6:39] <Darke> but they wouldnt
[6:39] <liq3> or i mean even iron.
[6:39] <Ronjoe> my apologies
[6:39] <vurtual> or metal

[6:39] <liq3> no point making diamond sights lol.
[6:39] <Darke> We are having a discussion about the game
[6:39] <vurtual> We want arc accountableness
[6:39] <vurtual> and maybe less arc, at that
[6:39] <Dragoon> It's pointless.
[6:39] <Kokopure> I think Skellies should drop... Iron ore sometimes.
[6:39] <Ronjoe> ergh, op:user ratio at its worst
[6:39] <liq3> realistic arcs!
[6:40] * sorre (sorretil@24-107-51-225.dhcp.stls.mo.charter.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[6:40] <vurtual> less arcing, so you can hit far away
[6:40] <Darke> Dragoon, we are allowed to talk about the game
[6:40] <rob`> vurtual: a flatter trajectory would be nice, but I've spent hundreds of hours shooting bows, and it just takes a little practice
[6:40] <vurtual> instead of falling like a grenade, it ends up falling down a while
[6:40] <Darke> There is no reason for us to be quiet
[6:40] <rob`> it's part of the skill
[6:40] * Ronjoe (Ronjoe@pool-71-101-38-174.tampfl.dsl-w.verizon.net) has left #minecraft
[6:40] <vurtual> a little, silly practice
[6:40] <vurtual> less marksman and more "how can I lob this rock just right?"
[6:40] <Dragoon> You're talking about "ZOMG IRON SIGHTS DID NOT EXIST/EXISTED IN THE MIDDLE AGES."
[6:40] <vurtual> turning them from "lame flingy weapon" to "projectile weapon that you point and kill" would be nice
[6:41] <Dude000> speaking of lame flingy weapon
[6:41] <vurtual> then bows could act a bit more arrow-ly, maybe even a warping arrow effect when they fire! And that would be fun.
[6:41] <Dude000> when you throw stone it should be able to hit enemies and deal damage
[6:41] <liq3> MC needs stonefall traps!
[6:41] <Kokopure> I would like to be able to hurl cobblestone as a weapon :3
[6:41] <liq3> >:)
[6:41] <Dude000> you know like throwing rocks
[6:41] <Darke> Dragoon, now we aren't
[6:41] <Darke> One person said that
[6:41] <Dragoon> Again, Skeletons should drop bone that could be used in weapons or other stuff
[6:41] <Darke> Oh, also, like TF2, lighting an arrow on fire with torches :3
[6:41] <vurtual> maybe bow function now could be the effect from failing to take time to aim
[6:42] <vurtual> or like zelda
[6:42] <liq3> Darke: You need special arrows to actually light them on fire...
[6:42] <Dude000> zelda's more magic
[6:42] <Darke> liq3, GAME GAME GAME GAME GAME GAME'
[6:42] <Dragoon> LIQ. MAGIC GODDAMN
[6:42] <vurtual> so, you ready the bow with mouse2, you have a basic bow-feeling vertical sight, then you hold down mouse1 and release, drawing and releasing the bow.
[6:42] <liq3> No magic in MC yet.
[6:42] <liq3> :P
[6:42] <Dragoon> FUCK YOUR SHIT.
[6:42] <vurtual> arrows are wood.
[6:42] <vurtual> wood burns.
[6:42] <vurtual> rate informative
[6:42] <rob`> fire arrows would be kinda neat, but it could be a little overpowered if it actually set people on fire without any way to put yourself out.
[6:42] <liq3> not well enough to light an arrow on fire.
[6:42] <Darke> Fire arrows wouldn't spread like normal fire though
[6:42] <vurtual> maybe there could be degrees of being on fire
[6:42] <Darke> They would just burn a small radius
[6:43] <Darke> And then stop
[6:43] <Darke> To keep from griefing
[6:43] <Darke> Notch is going to have to redo fire...
[6:43] <Dragoon> By the time the arrow gets into the guy, it doesn't matter if the wood is burning or not
[6:43] <vurtual> lightly burning could occour, where you're suffering burning, but not outright engulfed
[6:43] <rob`> double damage for fire arrows, or something, would be cool
[6:43] <Dragoon> Because now you have +1 arrow in your pancreas
[6:43] <vurtual> an arrow that's on fire could hit something extra flammable, causing it to burst into flames fully, and let fire spread
[6:43] <Darke> Dragoon, by the time the arrow gets in the guy, nobody cares because it's a game
[6:43] <liq3> normally iirc they'd use the same stuff they use for torches, wrap that around the arrow (either as the head, for burning down wooden stuff or hay or stuff... good against battering rams iirc, or further back behind the arrow head, to light anyone hit on fire).
[6:43] <liq3> :/
[6:43] <vurtual> just hit wood? The arrow burns in place, acts like a torch for a bit
[6:43] <vurtual> hit oils? Fiiiire.
[6:43] <Dragoon> Hit TNT? Boom
[6:44] <rob`> vurtual: I like that :D
[6:44] <Dragoon> Arrows hitting tnt should set it off anyway
[6:44] <liq3> no...
[6:44] <Darke> GAME GAME GAME GAME GAME GAME
[6:44] <liq3> they wouldn't spark.

[6:44] <Darke> Slapping TNT with a sword shoudln't set it off
[6:44] <vurtual> it could light a fuse if you hit the top
[6:44] <liq3> I don't want to fuck my shit.
[6:44] <Darke> Smacking TNT shouldnt set it off
[6:44] <vurtual> so you hit the exact fuse pixel? It ignites
[6:44] <Darke> Nobody cares its a game
[6:44] <liq3> Just use fire arrows.
[6:44] <EmpiresBane> we just need nitroglycerin

[6:45] <Dragoon> YOUR
[6:45] <EmpiresBane> screw tnt
[6:45] <Dragoon> SHIT
[6:45] <vurtual> also if you had magic, you could have spellbook weapon that has to be readied and then the quickbar becomes the spells you can cast, just throwing out that concept. because it made me think of this
[6:45] <rob`> if fire arrows set off tnt INSTANTLY, that would give it good tactical uses

[6:49] <vurtual> 9. Butts.
[6:49] <Dude000> Dude: 10. A punishment to an channel user will vary from the judgment of the Op and the amount of malice in whatever rule was broken. The Ops also reserve the right to enact any temporary rule to the channel in order to contain the peace.
[6:49] <PuyoDead> Destroyer, would you kindly shut up?
[6:49] <Dude000> see i can do it to

[6:49] <vurtual> Addendum: Buttbutts.
[6:49] <Darke> Thank you PuyoDead
[6:49] <Destroyer> out of all of this you target me?
[6:50] <PuyoDead> Yes.
[6:50] <liq3> I still think magic power crystals only found in the deepest caves would be win. :]
[6:50] <vurtual> Post-addendum: butt-buttbutts mcbutts
[6:50] <liq3> And you have to harvest them to cast any sort of useful magic.
[6:50] <Dragoon> Yes they would, liq
[6:50] <Destroyer> banned/kicked. If the problem persists, contact Not
[6:50] <Destroyer> might have to contact Notch over this
[6:50] <Dragoon> SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADUP

[6:50] <PuyoDead> You're being pointless. Dragoon is being pointless AND worthless.

[6:54] <Animator> Google it, Zarro.
[6:54] <vurtual> So my idea for magic now: You build bookcases, and then spells you create have to be stored in these bookcases, which take a fair amount of resources. It takes so many bookcases to store something powerful, or multiple can be stored in one bookcase. Then you can craft and equip a spellbook(equip and store? I don't know, you can only have one at a time usable), then you hit mouse2, and your quickbar is the 9 spells you store in it. Casting them could have
[6:54] <Dragoon> Can I abbreviate it?
[6:54] <vurtual> many requirements, some might need energy, resources, have limited uses within a time, or whatever. Maybe rare materials for it!

[6:55] <Darke> *Destroyer stopped before
[6:55] <Moocman> Thanks for teh spamming

[6:55] <Darke> tl;dr Addendum
[6:55] <Keiya> I wish we could place large chests next to each other without a space between them...
[6:55] <PuyoDead> Stopping does not = get away with shit.
[6:55] <Darke> okay

[6:56] <ZarroTsu> two lines at once
[6:56] <Dude000> chatzilla baby
[6:56] <vurtual> Anyways yeah, in short: Somehow obtain the physical knowledge of the spell, get the materials required for a magical bookshelf, build these all together, connected. Rightclick them, add the spell to them. Then, get out your spellbook, somehow interact and add it, mouse2 spellbook, select spell, have requirements, cast.
[6:56] <Dragoon> So, can someone pleaaase make a JC Denton skin for me? D:
[6:56] <Darke> vurtual, your "in short" was as long as your "in long"
[6:57] <Animator> I'm simultanouesly watching this channel and painting a room. Go figure.
[6:57] <liq3> vurtual: still sounds silly. xD
[6:57] <ZarroTsu> and if you die you have to do it all over again @ vurtual
[6:57] <vurtual> my in long was longer than the max message allowed for the network.
[6:57] <PuyoDead> Oh snap, garbage night.

[6:57] <Darke> Why is Dragoon_Jett?
[6:57] <Dragoon> :L
[6:57] <Darke> He is screwing with my auto-name
[6:57] <vurtual> a simple practicioner of tricks, or exemplary gentle manne would have a room with a few shelves
[6:57] <Darke> And it's annoying
[6:57] <slowriot> well we already have bookshelf blocks
[6:57] <vurtual> a true master of arcane might would have whole halls of books, studying all the time.
[6:57] <Darke> Dragoon, who is JC Denton
[6:57] <Shrub> Dicks.
[6:57] <liq3> He doesn't need them to cast spells tho...
[6:58] <ZarroTsu> I would suspect that a bookshelf item could be made with like an I shape of solid wood, and would act like a chest, only with book-specific items, and only in elongated rows
[6:58] <vurtual> maybe the spells in his book could wear out over time, like how nethack makes them fail
[6:58] <Darke> PuyoDead, auto ban script for "Fuck your shit"
[6:58] <Dragoon> Darke: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=14264 Deus Ex PC
[6:58] <liq3> And they rarerly contain anything he needs to actually cast them. They're mostly just research and journels and such.
[6:58] <vurtual> so he has to refresh them at the proper connected books

[6:58] <ZarroTsu> you'd go to a book store and loot all the books
[6:59] <ZarroTsu> learn the sheep summon spell
[6:59] <liq3> vurtual: I think spellbooks, acting a kind of 'wand' like you said before, that brings up spells whehn you equip it, and power crystals as ammo... :P
[6:59] <Dude000> i might
[6:59] <Darke> Or if you are a witch hunter you would burn book stores
[6:59] <ZarroTsu> ??? profit
[6:59] <liq3> This bookshelf stuff is very silly tho.
[6:59] <vurtual> power crystals could be one of the resources
[6:59] <Darke> Power crystals would be a high power resource
[6:59] <liq3> I want power crystals you find in caves. <#
[6:59] <liq3> <3
[6:59] <ZarroTsu> what's wrong with diamonds?
[6:59] <liq3> gotta mine em.
[6:59] <Darke> ZarroTsu, are diamonds magic?
[6:59] <ZarroTsu> yes?
[6:59] <Dragoon> I can imagine mystical looking stores selling crystals
[6:59] <Darke> NO
[6:59] <slowriot> crystals that grow like mushrooms could be good
[6:59] <Darke> Fuck you- no wait no
[6:59] <slowriot> and... i'm itching for obsidian
[6:59] <vurtual> referring to D&D in an unusual manner: A spell might just take waving your hands and saying something, material componets, or something more. Some might need just waving your hands, some various goods, some diamonds, some random stuff.
[6:59] <liq3> haha.
[7:00] <Dragoon> *+b's Darke* :D
[7:00] <liq3> Notch totally needs to put in his "stuff falls if it isn't connected to obsidian" idea.
[7:00] <liq3> :P
[7:00] <Kokopure_> Night all~
[7:00] <ZarroTsu> diamonds are crystalized carbon with a usually transpatent casing surface. There's plenty of room for a djinn to hide out in one.
[7:00] <vurtual> okay three or four part one: Guy one gets stuff required for a bookcase block, maybe one wood and some cloth and maybe something semi-rare and of magical-esque. Or just wood and cloth. He makes shelves.
[7:00] <Dragoon> But liq, that would make my floating fortress idea fail D:
[7:00] * Darke is now known as a
[7:00] <liq3> nono.
[7:00] <liq3> You mine some obsidian.
[7:00] * a is now known as Darke
[7:00] <liq3> Then use that as the "center" of the fortress.
[7:00] * Bomb_Spammer (chatzilla@S010600262d6df833.ss.shawcable.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:00] <liq3> it'd magically hold it up.
[7:00] <liq3> ;P
[7:01] <liq3> of course.
[7:01] <liq3> some evil villians could come and mine it.
[7:01] <Kokopure_> ...
[7:01] <liq3> and the whole fortress would fall. :D
[7:01] <Dude000> can it be set on a server to server basis
[7:01] <Dragoon> But I'd have to search long for it, and I wouldn't be able to create my hidden fortress D:
[7:01] <Dude000> because i don't want that that's boring
[7:01] <Animator> Shoot the core!
[7:01] <Kokopure_> Question
[7:01] <Kokopure_> Would this mean
[7:01] <Kokopure_> That all materials behave like sand :/?
[7:01] * Darke is now known as c
[7:01] <liq3> no...
[7:01] <vurtual> no they fall connected
[7:01] <Kokopure_> Because that would suck for mining.
[7:01] <vurtual> Then, wizard guy somehow has some way of physically figuring the spell he wants to know, he goes up to shelf, picks it, and it has a completiony bar, like cooking, but variant. You could have multiple disconnected shelves, but couldn't use the huge room for big spells.
[7:01] * c is now known as d
[7:01] * d is now known as e

[7:02] <Darke> ...How is that a fail client
[7:02] <vurtual> Guy three, the wizard who wants to read stuff, grabs his somehow simeltaneously quickbarred and equipped spellbook(which... could be harder to craft than a shelf), goes up to the shelf with a spell in it, and scribes the simple part down.
[7:02] <Darke> I changed my name to e
[7:02] <Dragoon> I hate to repeat myself, but someone please make a JC denton skin..
[7:02] <Darke> Whenever you used the letter e it highlighted your message

[7:06] <Dude000> what you keep saying
[7:06] <liq3> Spellbooks could be limited to like, 8 spells.
[7:06] <vurtual> yeah this is similar
[7:06] <vurtual> except you need the shelves
[7:06] <liq3> fuck shelves.
[7:06] <vurtual> ;_;
[7:07] <liq3> :p
[7:07] <vurtual> then after having recorded down certain multiple high level spells into your library, you can slowly leave your magical books to cook together some mega-spell, taking up many, many blocks of shelf, and having many times longer a creation time.

[7:12] * Roadcrosser (Jun_Ming@116.206.187.186) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[7:12] <Darke> Really simple and calm
[7:12] <Dude000> technically you could consider the crafting system a mini tech tree
[7:12] <Darke> Mini
[7:12] <Darke> Mini
[7:12] <leBMD> sort of
[7:12] <Dude000> well then add more mini tech trees
[7:13] <Darke> Then you have a huge overcomplicated tech tree for magic
[7:13] <Keiya> vurtual: Make the materials needed to craft a wand of MEGADEATHRAY hard to get
[7:13] <Darke> Make a tiny magic tech tree
[7:13] <vurtual> but I'm not suggesting wands ;_;
[7:13] <Visiiri> http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/6075/creepersuck.png
[7:13] <Dragoon> Mega Death Ray makes me think of Dr. Horrible
[7:13] <Darke> That involves the same crafting system to make spells
[7:13] <liq3> vurtual: you just make the requirements ridiculous.
[7:13] <leBMD> or, make a tree out of iron
[7:13] <Dude000> ignite to fireball to firewall to tornado of fire that rapes everything
[7:13] <vurtual> now shut it with your IT MUST BE SIMPLE, because that's screwing us all over like the worst kind of religious people, we're getting self destructive heere
[7:13] <leBMD> voila, a tech tree.
[7:13] <Dude000> except less broken
[7:13] <Dude000> and op
[7:13] <vurtual> oh yeah that seems pretty plain
[7:13] <Keiya> vurtual: So wands are simpler, easier to integrate.
[7:13] <Superwafflez> At the moment, magic seems stupid for minecraft. There, I said it.
[7:13] <liq3> e.g. Mega death ray requirements - 1 bone of Death.
[7:13] <Darke> Tech trees would not be used
[7:13] <liq3> goodluck killing death. ;]
[7:13] <Darke> I mean like an RTS tech tree
[7:13] <Darke> Notch doesnt like menus
[7:13] <Dude000> i'm thinking diablo 2 but that's just me
[7:14] <Keiya> And yeah, you don't want menus 'in play'
[7:14] <Keiya> Hmm...
[7:14] <Keiya> Maybe wands you have to charge before wandering out?
[7:14] <Darke> Using crafting system? Sure
[7:14] <Superwafflez> Y'all just want to turn this into a FPS runescape dont you, lol.
[7:14] <liq3> spellbook... :/
[7:14] <vurtual> so just a recap: Guy gets some cloth and wood, makes some bookshelf blocks(same texture as now even), then he has a huge selection of spells available, picks one, and after some time, and with enough bookshelf space, it's recorded
[7:14] <Darke> Superwafflez, what? No
[7:15] <Darke> Nou vurtual
[7:15] <liq3> vurtual: and if the shelves are destroye you have to start over? YEH that's gonna be fun -.-
[7:15] <vurtual> it'd take a little bit of time
[7:15] <Keiya> vurtual: Eh... that sounds too much like D&D's 'spend 12 hours sleeping and reading for 10 seconds of magic'.
[7:15] <vurtual> epic information being lost like the library of alexandria?
[7:15] <vurtual> you could go walk away
[7:15] <vurtual> they write in themselves
[7:16] <Jat> better yet you build bookshelves and then "mine" them for a while as reasearch
[7:16] <Jat> then you learn new spells
[7:16] <liq3> ...
[7:16] <Jat> or something
[7:16] <vurtual> it'd be like the furnace
[7:16] <vurtual> a time, and you just go chill and minecraft around while it finishes the spell
[7:16] <Keiya> I like the idea of one item -> one spell, an item being reusable
[7:16] <vurtual> then he pulls out his spellbook he crafted, opens the shelves again, picks the spells he wants, and just runs off with his happy little spellbook
[7:16] <Vicrry> ?
[7:17] <Keiya> Basically
[7:17] <Vicrry> There's actually gonna be magic?
[7:17] <Keiya> Magic as tools.
[7:17] <vurtual> using them would be just pulling out the spellbook like you would a weapon, hit mouse2, and that toggles wether your quickbar is the spells, or items. Mouse1 the spells to cast them. mouse2 at any time to switch back.
[7:17] <Keiya> Rather than some complex spell system
[7:17] <Jat> i think notch wants to at least add enchanting
[7:17] <Dude000> oh man this is probably exactly what vurtual just said but
[7:17] <Dragoon> Anyone else hate vuvuze-BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
[7:17] <vurtual> Then, you'll have to meet wahtever requirements.
[7:17] <Dude000> craft spellbook and bookshell
[7:17] <Dude000> mine for spell components
[7:17] <liq3> I think still crafting a spellbook, and then writing spells in it, would be a lot easier and better. :p
[7:17] <Keiya> vurtual: eehhh... why not my system, where you don't need the quickbar toggle?
[7:17] <Dude000> bookshelf even
[7:17] <vurtual> that'd be one way of using magic I guess
[7:18] <liq3> Keiya: hrm?
[7:18] <vurtual> Then maybe you could use your spellbook to craft magic items imbued with spells
[7:18] <Dude000> use bookshelf like a furnace to turn spell components into spells
[7:18] <Dude000> choose your spells
[7:18] <vurtual> single-use, easy to use scrolls if you want, for the itemless masses.
[7:18] <Keiya> What's your obsession with spellbooks?
[7:18] <Dude000> get a spellbook
[7:18] <Dude000> spam magic until people die
[7:18] <Keiya> Do it alchemy style >_>
[7:18] <Dude000> or monsters
[7:18] <liq3> spellbooks are cool o.o
[7:18] <Dude000> or ground
[7:18] <vurtual> yeah except I had the componets come in while you use the spell on the spot
[7:18] <Dragoon> Ani, you working on the skin?
[7:18] <vurtual> wands for reusability, or maybe items enchanted.
[7:18] <Keiya> vurtual: Basically, see.
[7:18] <Dude000> replace spellbook with wands scrolls staffs whatever
[7:18] <vurtual> I mean, why can't we have all of them?
[7:18] * TrueWolves (DontGiveUp@69-176-226-109.static.izoom.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:18] <vurtual> items with spells imbued, spellbooks, you can have both!
[7:18] <liq3> having some magic looking guy with a speelbook open in one hand, while he chants and lightning crackles in the other hand before shooting out... :P
[7:18] * Vicrry goes to read the dev blog :P
[7:18] <vurtual> You almost always do
[7:18] * Animator sets mode +o TrueWolves
[7:19] <Keiya> vurtual: no real /point/
[7:19] <Keiya> I mean, I guess you could have the spellbook as a concept
[7:19] * gordenfreechmen (pigman@68-30-126-189.pools.spcsdns.net) Quit (Quit: Orion 1.8 - Get it at http://tellini.info/index_en.html)
[7:19] <vurtual> while magic items would be expensive, not that wonderful
[7:19] <Keiya> But I don't see a point to lugging it around
[7:19] <vurtual> a wizard with proper regeants could unleash spells many times.
[7:19] <vurtual> maybe even magic too powerful for a wand or scorll.
[7:19] <liq3> Keiya: what about the spellbook switches the hotkeys to spells, and 0 switches back to non-spells? :/
[7:20] <vurtual> why not toggle?
[7:20] <Keiya> It makes more sense, in the established framework, to craft a wand that can be used some number of times before it crumbles that basically acts like a pick or shovel
[7:20] <Vicrry> I would want a spell for one reason only: to fix my picks so I don't has to carry around inventories full of them to dig a hole :P
[7:20] <vurtual> You have the spellbook up infront of you like normal, but hitting mouse2 switches your bar, and your other hand comes up, maybe with a cool effect for what spell is open
[7:20] <Keiya> Because it adds more menus and switching and... when there's a simple method that /doesn't/
[7:20] <vurtual> it'd be a nice visual aid
[7:20] <Dude000> great
[7:20] <Dude000> stupid idea incoming
[7:20] <vurtual> click mouse2 again, and your spellbook is closed, your magical hand down, and you're back to normal
[7:20] <Keiya> vurtual: Okay
[7:21] <Keiya> See, when Notch introduced tools
[7:21] <Dude000> scrolls is a one use somewhat powerful spell, then the scroll disappears
[7:21] <Dude000> spellbook is basically many scrolls in one book
[7:21] <Keiya> You switched to tool mode and pulled out your tool, then switched back to block mode to place blocks, right? :P
[7:21] <Dude000> wand is one slightly weaker spell, but can be used until you run out of charges
[7:21] <Dude000> staff is a couple slightly weaker spells, to be used until you run out of charges
[7:21] <Keiya> Basically, you're suggesting major changes to the way Minecraft plays, rather than extensions.
[7:22] <vurtual> this is just a menu for the spellbook, which changes the quickbar at the bottom back and forth
[7:22] <vurtual> I've messed around with this concept before, not confusing or anything
[7:22] <Darke> vurtual, write this shit down
[7:22] <Darke> Whether or not I agree with you
[7:23] <Keiya> vurtual: Do you change to the tools menu in Minecraft?
[7:23] <vurtual> Here's what I'm thinking: The spellbook would be the most diverse magical item, capible of recording many uses of powerful spells, and maaany uses of weaker ones, yet you can't lug around 50. Scrolls use once, can also hold powerful spells too. Wands have limits on functionality and power, but have many charges.
[7:23] <Keiya> Or is there just a single inventory, a single menu?
[7:23] * f (fragmer@c-75-70-111-121.hsd1.co.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
[7:23] <liq3> Keiya: tools have one use. A spellbook might have many spells.
[7:23] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[7:23] <Keiya> liq3: *why*
[7:23] <liq3> Having different 'tools' for each spell would feel clunky imo. :P
[7:23] <Keiya> Why not do one spell -> one item?
[7:23] <Dude000> great
[7:23] <vurtual> clunkiness
[7:23] <Bacu> I say magic should be more mundane.
[7:23] <vurtual> we are the scolars, scientists, and philosiphers of our time
[7:24] <liq3> Having say enchanted scrolls that would do one use spells would be nice too.
[7:24] <Dragoon> Animatorrrr
[7:24] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[7:24] <Keiya> You're not likely to be carting around thousands of epic spells when you go out to chop down trees, after all
[7:24] <liq3> But I still want my spellbooks that don't run out.

[7:24] <liq3> Keiya: You got a point there... :/
[7:24] <Bacu> making grass grow, trees grow. mossifying stone, light sources, maybe moving a few things around. stuff like that, not fireballs.
[7:24] <Keiya> You're more likely to have tool repair, maybe some selfdefense, and leave everything else at home
[7:24] <Dude000> >no fireballs
[7:24] <vurtual> so you scroll/numbers to the spellbook in your quickbar, then press mouse2, and now your bar is spells you put in the spellbook earlier. pressing mouse2 at any time in this bar will go back to the tools, as will inventory menu.
[7:25] <vurtual> maybe some spells will require multiple "slots" to hold, so you'll be limited on number with them.
[7:25] <liq3> Actually that'd be pretty simple.
[7:25] <Keiya> (self defense could take the form of fireballs and magic missiles, or shielding and inflicting status effects, or whatever.)
[7:25] <liq3> if the spellbook is in one, and fireball in the first spell slot, it'd just be... 1,m2 (mouse2),1,LC,m2,w/e.
[7:25] <vurtual> spellbooks would too eventually wear out, but simple mundane ones would last a long time(spam 'em all day), while others would probably wear out after a bit. Maybe choose to put more extra repeat-space to some spells, so they last longer.
[7:25] <Dude000> i cast magic missile at the darkness
[7:26] <liq3> vurtual: uh, they're spellbooks. Spell books don' twear out.
[7:26] <liq3> :P
[7:26] <liq3> Not if they're in use.
[7:26] <vurtual> I'm thinking like the nethack universal spellbook you have
[7:26] <vurtual> spells you can innately cast would eventually have to be relearned
[7:26] <liq3> I'm thinking "magic spellbooks which don't degrade due to magic"
[7:27] <Keiya> But see
[7:27] <vurtual> maybe with a bit of D&D-ly day-limits, but not days
[7:27] <vurtual> if you want to go fight, you just go run over to the bookcase, switch around like you would items, then go run off again
[7:27] <Keiya> If you're areguing clunkyness, why arent tools on a separate menu so they don't take up all your inventory and require you to switch around and...
[7:27] <vurtual> if you're just walking around, you'll probably carry a few simple useful ones, and pull it out when you need that.
[7:27] <Keiya> I don't see why magic should be different, basically
[7:27] <vurtual> because tools are physical tools
[7:27] <vurtual> while magic is knowledge
[7:28] <vurtual> and has always been considered very distinct and seperate from mundane actions that you percieve with your eyes
[7:28] <liq3> i'm thinking spellbooks like this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD_7J5lejPQ&feature=related

[7:28] <LuciferZ> To start with anyways
[7:28] <vurtual> I plead
[7:28] <vurtual> draw a voltron of all the mobs
[7:28] <Vicrry> Summon Arrow - and it's unlimited and is bound to some key, let's say tab :P
[7:28] <LuciferZ> Vurtual: So it shall be
[7:28] <vurtual> spider=lower body, the legs are a samurai skirt-like thing
[7:29] <vurtual> zombie is the upperest body and head
[7:29] <Keiya> does it make more sense to add new items, or to add whole new menus and switching and?
[7:29] <liq3> Keiya: well i don't see a problem with a second hotkey bar.
[7:29] <vurtual> creeper is the right arm, a rocket launcher and jetpack. Skeleton left arm, fires arrows. Sheep left leg, he lands on it to soften impact, pig right leg.
[7:29] <liq3> if it's such a problem you could always have like, 'hotkeys' for the spells in the book, which work with the normal one.

[7:30] <liq3> Keiya: what?
[7:30] <Vicrry> also, LuciferZ's IRC client goes BING!
[7:30] <vurtual> oh and while things like "harden tool", "run really fast", "make wounds heal", and "dig block" would take up a single slot of 10, something like "GIGANTIC BOULDER THAT HITS THINGS" might require 2, the extra ones being locked from spell use.
[7:30] <LuciferZ> Vurtual get the fuck in
[7:30] <Keiya> liq3: I'm teasing the youtube link you pasted
[7:30] <liq3> Keiya: from a gameplay perspective it'd just be 5 (spellbook), pick spell, press m1, repeat.
[7:31] <liq3> haha. :P
[7:31] <liq3> I just like the whole "glowing open spellbook in one hand" thing.
[7:31] <liq3> It looks so badass. :]
[7:31] <vurtual> you really need that beam ray soon? Set it to your main tool list, but now you can't put a tool there.
[7:31] <vurtual> I have no sound z
[7:31] <vurtual> I'll brb let me hit the bsaement up
[7:31] <Dragoon> Animooter.
[7:32] <Keiya> why should magic be different from a bow & arrow or a pick or planting a flower or hanging a painting...
[7:32] <Keiya> Minecraft has a very simple, effective UI. Why mess with it? :P
[7:32] <Dude000> fantastic
[7:33] <Keiya> Besides, have you ever carried a book while you're running around doing stuff? it gets beat up reaaaaal fast :P
[7:33] <liq3> Keiya: You don't have to. :/
[7:33] <liq3> I'd be fine with the "one item per spell" thing.
[7:34] <vurtual> because casting a spell isn't picking up a flower
[7:34] <vurtual> It generally involves hand waving and words and research
[7:34] <liq3> ^
[7:34] <liq3> we can skip the research part. ;]

[7:36] <vurtual> the research would be a nice way to limit someone's ability to do stuff
[7:36] <Dude000> maybe be able to craft gems together to get better gems
[7:36] <Dude000> 9 gems to 1 super gem
[7:36] <vurtual> maybe writing down the spell takes magic ink or something
[7:36] <Dude000> 9 super gems to 1 amazing gem
[7:36] <liq3> ...
[7:36] <vurtual> that sounds not fun :(
[7:36] <Dude000> it's simple
[7:36] <liq3> I still prefer the "Metoer - requires 1 dragon heart"

[7:36] <Dude000> yes i'm attempting to make fun of everyone
[7:37] <Dude000> because "too complex :((((((((((((("
[7:37] <Keiya> vurtual: And picking a flower and mining with a pick, chopping down a tree, and opening a door are so similar? :P
[7:37] <vurtual> no they are not

[7:41] <liq3> I don't what 3-4 spells i MIGHT use in my hotkeys.
[7:41] <vurtual> ooh, maybe if you fail a spell(some requirement is not met, some item is not around, or you have too much of some penalty), it should wind down the sound, and just shoot colored sparkles everywhere
[7:41] <Keiya> vurtual: how much magic will you really need constantly, though?
[7:41] <liq3> i'd rather have a single spellbook.
[7:42] <Keiya> liq3: So store them in your inventory unless you need them?
[7:42] <vurtual> I'd be a wizard
[7:42] <Dude000> oh oh oh
[7:42] <Dude000> can there be arcane spell failure

[7:42] <Dude000> just so notch can have an even bigger trollface

[7:42] <Keiya> i->move an item not hard.
[7:42] <Vicrry> WTF IS GOING ON IN HERE?!?!
[7:42] <Keiya> Ooh, that
[7:42] <vurtual> the spellbook is a quicker way to reach all your slot-specific spells
[7:42] <Dude000> also another note
[7:43] <Keiya> One or two combat spells is just like a bow&arrow and a sword
[7:43] <wry> vurtual: could you add eimhear to the guild? apparently i can't add my own characters
[7:43] <vurtual> and to have them laid out
[7:43] <vurtual> I dunno wry
[7:43] <liq3> Keiya: a sword only takes up one slot. :/
[7:43] <Dude000> who uses the quickbar for anything other than dirt, sword, pickaxe, and meat anyway
[7:43] <vurtual> I'm philosiphizing
[7:43] <Keiya> Do you complain about having a bow and a sword taking up space on your quickbar?
[7:43] <vurtual> no they're one weapon
[7:43] <Keiya> liq3: So does the bow.
[7:43] <vurtual> but spells are a whole genre
[7:43] <wry> vurtual: you're an officer, that means you can invite
[7:43] <liq3> i don't use a bow lol.
[7:43] <Keiya> And in my system
[7:43] <liq3> think about it...
[7:43] <liq3> combat situation.
[7:43] <wry> vurtual: i was wondering if you are capable at the moment
[7:43] <liq3> like a war...
[7:43] <Keiya> so would fireball. Or harden weapon. Or...
[7:44] <liq3> you might have 2-3 spells you NEED
[7:44] <Keiya> wait
[7:44] <Keiya> oh.
[7:44] <liq3> so that's, sword, bow, blocks of dirt/stone, 3 spells, hp.
[7:44] <Keiya> See, my assumption was that only a few spells would be combat oriented...
[7:44] <Keiya> and that you'd mostly take them /instead of/ sword/bow
[7:44] <liq3> Keiya: well i'm expecting stuff like fireball, maybe a "push back" spell, i dunno. :/
[7:45] <vurtual> Let me list how many spells you could really have: fireballs, air blasts, elemental powers, enchantment, and so on
[7:45] <liq3> well unless Notch does something like "spells are weaker when you're wearing armour", i doubt we'll get specialists.
[7:45] <Keiya> Hmm...
[7:45] <vurtual> infact here let me show you how diverse magic can be
[7:45] <Dude000> arcane spell failure
[7:45] <Dude000> cloth armour or below is none
[7:45] <Keiya> vurtual: And how many of those will you need in less than a second? :P

[7:45] <Dude000> diamond is 50%
[7:46] <liq3> damage, aoe damage, DoTs, slows, freezes (probably never), push backs....
[7:46] <liq3> What else? :P
[7:46] <Dude000> heal
[7:46] <Keiya> Maybe a compromise of a second quickbar you can put whatever on, accessed via ctrl-<number>?
[7:46] <liq3> heal!
[7:46] <liq3> yes
[7:46] <vurtual> look around Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, Transmutation, and "universal"
[7:46] <vurtual> There's LOADS of things magic can do
[7:46] <Dude000> necromancy
[7:46] <vurtual> 9 spells alone is a limit
[7:46] <wry> vurtual: or you could just ignore me, i guess
[7:46] <Dude000> oh god commanding skeletons
[7:46] <vurtual> wry i'm busy now
[7:46] <Dude000> i don't care how hard it was i'd specialize just for commanding skeletons
[7:46] <vurtual> I'll fondle your DDs latter, O.
[7:46] <wry> vurtual: then tell me that
[7:46] <vurtual> I did once
[7:47] <wry> vurtual: no, you typed maybe
[7:47] <liq3> lol necromancer.
[7:47] <wry> vurtual: that doesn't mean no
[7:47] <Keiya> If you DO do spells as a separate thing, it probably makes more sense to keyboard 'em...

[7:47] <Dragoon> I wish someone would make the skin :(
[7:47] <Keiya> And if you're going to do a second quickbar, why not make it generic?
[7:47] <liq3> Keiya: depends on how much Notch wants magic to be used. :/
[7:47] <Keiya> so, 1-9, ctrl 1-9.

[7:48] <Keiya> liq3: It's perfectly sensable if you have ctrl bound to capslock :P
[7:48] <vurtual> just 1-9
[7:48] <vurtual> that'd be the limit, it'd make you specialize a bit

[7:48] <vurtual> then really powerful things like "a giant boulder comes forth and slams into someone, then vanishes" might require 2, and you have some slots locked
[7:48] <liq3> Keiya: which i don't.
[7:49] <Dude000> fantastic
[7:49] <Dragoon> Someone PUHLEAAAASE make me a JC Denton skinnn
[7:49] <Dude000> no
[7:49] <liq3> o.o
[7:49] <vurtual> ooh, and maybe when you switch, the spellbook flips itself and shows what'd be on that page
[7:49] <Dude000> if nobody is going to bother
[7:49] <Dude000> why in god's name would you keep trying
[7:49] <vurtual> so it'd have an icon for each one, that looks like a drawn, in-act version of the spell's quickbar icon
[7:49] <Dragoon> Because I can, so eff your ess.
[7:49] <vurtual> giant boulder wuold be a giant boulder falling down a hill, and there'd be writing and it'd look like you wrote things like magic words and requirements in that spellbook page.
[7:50] <Dude000> but i don't have any s to f
[7:50] <vurtual> extra pages would have further information that can't be read
[7:50] <Keiya> You guys never answered 'making it a generic extra 9'
[7:50] <Keiya> but bleh...
[7:51] <vurtual> the readying feature(where it toggles function) could be rapidly useful
[7:51] <Keiya> I think you're trying to go 'top down, redesign the game around the feature', where I'm trying to go 'bottom up, add the feature to the game as it is'
[7:52] <liq3> Keiya: spell book that switches to spells which you press mouse 2 while it's equipped is pretty damn simple.
[7:52] <liq3> :/
[7:52] <vurtual> I'm just adding one little tiny menu
[7:52] <Dragoon> You guys have been talking about this for an hour now.

[7:52] <liq3> and pressing mouse2 at any time while the spell bar is out switches back to narm.l Very simple.
[7:52] <Dragoon> Make a suggestion thread
[7:52] <Dragoon> :D
[7:52] <vurtual> no, forums SUCK
[7:52] <LG_Legacy> >_>

[7:53] <Dragoon> LG, you're good at making skins, right?
[7:53] <LG_Legacy> No
[7:53] <vurtual> oh and something I want to make not forgetted: Any "advanced" weapon could have this, and bows would have to be readied up, then you can scroll between all the arrow types you have.
[7:53] <Dragoon> :L
[7:53] <vurtual> TrueWolves, GET IN HERE DENTON
[7:53] <Dragoon> Well eff my ess
[7:53] <Dude000> vurtual
[7:53] <LG_Legacy> >_>?
[7:53] <Dude000> no
[7:53] <Dude000> arrows are physical matter
[7:54] <Dragoon> I just want a JC Denton skin D:
[7:54] <vurtual> and it highlights what arrows you have, and you can fire any of those
[7:54] <vurtual> rather than having to automatically decide which arrow is more "next" than the other, or having a quiver
[7:54] <Dude000> why not have a quiver?
[7:54] <vurtual> less options
[7:54] <Dude000> makes more sense than pulling it out of your invisible hammer space
[7:54] <vurtual> well I like this idea ok
[7:54] <vurtual> so when you ready the bow to carefully aim and fire, you'll probably have like, 5 arrow types with you, maybe just one
[7:55] <Dragoon> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[7:55] <vurtual> the 0-9 would list all the arrow types, a generic arrow icon, a well made super-arrow, long arrows, fire arrows, all the arrows your bow can use
[7:55] <liq3> wow, ladders are nice.
[7:55] <vurtual> scroll between them, use your bow
[7:55] <vurtual> if you don't have that arrow in your inventory, the icon is blank/grayed out.
[7:55] <Keiya> liq3: I think that seems /more/ time consuming to access than just having it on the quickbar >_>
[7:55] <Dragoon> Just stick in a suggestion thread, jebus chroist
[7:55] <Dragoon> this in*
[7:55] <liq3> Keiya: make it optional.
[7:55] <liq3> :P
[7:55] <vurtual> I hate the very concept of a forum
[7:56] <Keiya> Whatever. If you want to sabotoge your own goals...
[7:56] <liq3> have wands or something that only cast a single spell.
[7:56] <vurtual> use your spellbook, or just drag all your stuff in there
[7:56] <Dude000> great
[7:56] <vurtual> or use magic items
[7:56] <Dude000> we should have versus mode
[7:56] <Dude000> player controlled monsters
[7:56] <Dude000> survivors try to survive for x time and player controlled monsters try to make them dead
[7:56] <Keiya> liq3: That's excessive redundency, and the time spent implementing it could be better spent elsewhere.
[7:56] <Dude000> and survivors might be able to become monsters when they die
[7:56] <Dude000> not sure
[7:57] <Dude000> depends on how balance works out
[7:57] <Keiya> Dude000: And when a creeper explodes on you it attracts a bunch of zombies!

[7:57] <liq3> Notch isn't even going to touch magic until after beta afiak.
[7:57] <vurtual> maybe a really dedicated wizard hauls around many regeants, many magic items(for simpler spells, he'd have wands of them. more single-usely, he'd have scrolls), then his most valued wuold be in his spellbook
[7:57] <Dude000> whoa keiya
[7:57] <liq3> So that comment wasn't needed.
[7:57] <Dude000> you mad
[7:57] <liq3> :/
[7:57] <Dude000> quit getting mad because my ideas are inspired by other games
[7:57] <Dragoon> :L
[7:58] <Keiya> Dude000: It just doesn't seem worth it. Especially since calculating 'far enough' would be a hell of a lot more complicated in Minecraft, and the mobs have a far 'flatter' range of power
[7:58] <Keiya> So there's really nothing over a deathmatch mode :P
[7:58] <Dude000> what
[7:59] <Keiya> well
[7:59] <Dude000> it's not really deathmatch as it is "survival with a timelimit and player-controlled creepers"
[7:59] * F3ar (F3ar@c-98-235-96-5.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:59] <Keiya> why make some players players and other players monsters, instead of just letting players fight?
[7:59] <vurtual> or shmoe joe the enchanter would have a few spells on him, maybe not even his whole inventory, and party that way, keeping a few random items with him so he can fix his door
[7:59] <Dude000> letting players fight
[7:59] <vurtual> also on team battles in minecraft:
[7:59] <vurtual> One side is players with gears, happy worker class of minecraft
[8:00] <vurtual> the other are wizards who can only cast transformation and random silly spells
[8:00] <vurtual> so they turn into mobs and fight
[8:00] <Dude000> uhh
[8:00] <Dude000> no
[8:00] <vurtual> so basically minecrafters with tools and supplies
[8:00] <Dude000> don't bring in magic just for the sake of brining in magic
[8:00] <vurtual> vs minecrafters who can be mobs
[8:00] <Dude000> bringing even
[8:00] <vurtual> well how else would you explain turning into stuff?

[8:01] <Dude000> "or died horribly and thus failed as a survivor and hate the survivors for winning"
[8:02] <vurtual> also because I spent a whole hour talking about magic: Wizard mobs
[8:02] <vurtual> liches or something
[8:02] <Dude000> oh oh oh
[8:02] <vurtual> or in an imply manner, they don't outright fight you if you don't confront them, and just mess with you
[8:02] <vurtual> imp mobs who do that, and then liches who are serious stuff
[8:02] <Dude000> the mob team can spawn as whatever they want
[8:02] <Dude000> but they slowly unlock things based on time
[8:02] <vurtual> natural selectiony?
[8:03] <Dude000> because the survivors will slowly be working up their strengths
[8:03] <vurtual> the mob team gains more... thing they gain, the more gathered goals the players have. Like magic keys or something.
[8:03] <vurtual> or the parts they need to win
[8:03] <Dude000> being alive
[8:03] <Dragoon> I swear if you guys don't put this in a suggestion thread I will kill you all until you are dead
[8:04] <vurtual> we put it in IRC
[8:04] <vurtual> It becomes hewn into the conscious
[8:04] <vurtual> it gets stuff done

[9:37] <Sade> Yeah o.o
[9:37] <Crix> must have been a once thing
[9:37] <Crix> because I'm pretty sure it only starts spawning at sea level or below
[9:37] <Sade> Yeah, rarely saw it :P
[9:38] <Zedo_Mann> Just fought arrows with fire :D
[9:38] <Sade> xD
[9:40] <Crix> So what kind of crafters/builders are you?
[9:40] <Crix> in terms of nature
[9:40] <Crix> Do you destroy everything and make a clean slate?
[9:41] <Crix> Do you incorporate everything into your design?
[9:42] <Zedo_Mann> am I being punished for burning trees?
[9:42] <Crix> yes
[9:42] <Zedo_Mann> I tried to cook meat on an open fire and it disapearwd

[9:42] <Zedo_Mann> it dies

[9:45] <TkTech> Zedo_Mann: I make 4x25 towers with steps wrapping around them
[9:45] <TkTech> then torch the top
[9:45] <TkTech> at the bottom I put signs pointing back to the base
[9:45] <Zedo_Mann> why?
[9:45] <Crix> 4x25 as in X,Y?
[9:45] <Crix> or X+Y,Z?
[9:46] <TkTech> sorry, 2x2x25
[9:46] <TkTech> one sec
[9:46] <Crix> ok

[9:50] <Crix> Guys: Coal or planks for your furnaces?
[9:50] <Zedo_Mann> coal.
[9:51] <Crix> I do coal
[9:51] <Crix> if the leaves fell on their own...
[9:51] <Zedo_Mann> I want to be the pyro of infdev MP.
[9:51] <Crix> wood would be a lot easier to collect
[9:51] <Zedo_Mann> I want to sneak in and burn an enemy village.
[9:51] <Crix> but even when it is
[9:51] <Crix> its such a hassle...
[9:51] <Crix> because a full 64 stack of planks goes down to 21 burning only 1 stack of something
[9:52] <Crix> coal will go for 8 stacks
[9:52] <Zedo_Mann> yup
[9:52] <Zedo_Mann> i had to use wood on my exploration though...
[9:54] <TkTech> Crix: goddamn game keeps closing when I tab out

[9:54] <Crix> lol that sucks!
[9:54] <Crix> mine just pauses
[9:54] <TkTech> tower in the far back is one of the main observatory towers
[9:54] <Zedo_Mann> omg
[9:54] <TkTech> inbetween those towers are those little ones
[9:54] <Zedo_Mann> like 5 pigs
[9:54] <TkTech> which mark the path
[9:54] <Zedo_Mann> one drops one pork
[9:54] <Zedo_Mann> another drops 2 pork

[10:01] <Crix> but what about coordinates?
[10:01] <chariot> Jackal 19.24 mb
[10:01] <Crix> X, Y, and Z
[10:01] <Jackal> nice
[10:01] <Jackal> btw crix
[10:01] <Crix> Z would remain constant, but X and Y would be centered around your spawn point
[10:01] <Jackal> its called the sun
[10:01] <Jackal> =p
[10:01] <Crix> The sun is NOT a clock
[10:01] <chariot> I'll upload current progress, I hope to finish tonight
[10:01] <Crix> its helpful
[10:01] <Jackal> a sundial is
[10:01] <chariot> a screen*
[10:01] <Jackal> however
[10:01] <Crix> and fog tells you whether its day/night
[10:02] <Crix> even underground
[10:02] <TkTech> Crix: http://img42.imageshack.us/i/shaft1.png/ <-- Main mine shaft. Two bridges aren't part of a mine, they're highways that happen to intersect it
[10:02] <Crix> but I still want a clock lol
[10:02] <Crix> lol thats tight
[10:02] <TkTech> Crix: http://img815.imageshack.us/i/shaft2.png/ <-- Start of the fort
[10:02] <Crix> good lord
[10:02] <Crix> stop being so much more epic than me please
[10:02] <TkTech> bad picture, doesn't do it justice
[10:02] <Jackal> heh
[10:02] <Shadaez> i am bored
[10:02] <TkTech> lol :P I have no life
[10:03] <Jackal> im more of an underground DF kinda guy =p
[10:03] <Jackal> i have a tunnel that increased my map size x2
[10:03] <TkTech> I mine everything in a region before spreading out
[10:03] <Jackal> i dont explore very much though so its only like 4mb
[10:03] <Crix> I have my patented mining technique
[10:03] <Crix> which I employ near the bottom of the map
[10:04] <Crix> for maximum gold/diamond findings
[10:04] <Zedo_Mann> I am burning trees for good luck.
[10:04] <Jackal> what strip mining?
[10:04] <Crix> no
[10:04] <Crix> i go horizontal
[10:04] <Crix> but not in a line
[10:04] <Jackal> ...
[10:04] <Crix> i go in a grid
[10:04] <Jackal> aka strip mining <.<
[10:04] <Jackal> taking everything out
[10:04] <chariot> I started a few forest fires when I was walking the coast of my island
[10:04] <Jackal> and leaving nothing
[10:04] <Crix> i thought strip mining was vertical?
[10:04] <Crix> no no
[10:04] <Jackal> no
[10:04] <Jackal> strip as in removing everything
[10:04] <chariot> they dont seem to spread too much when you're far off
[10:04] <Crix> I leave 3x3 colums EVERYWHERE
[10:04] <Jackal> yeah
[10:04] <Crix> it's too inefficient to mine everything
[10:04] <Jackal> but it doesnt have anything in that pillar
[10:05] <Zedo_Mann> 3x3 columns...3x3 columns EVERYWHERE!
[10:05] <Crix> my method is super efficient in terms of how much i uncover vs how much i mine
[10:05] <Jackal> so its completely stripping the layer of resources
[10:05] <Crix> well
[10:05] <Crix> it could have something in that hidden 1x1 spot ><
[10:05] <Jackal> unless its a diamond
[10:05] <Jackal> its unlikely

[10:05] <Jackal> since most resources dont sit in 1 square
[10:05] <Crix> well in this infdev diamonds are pretty big
[10:05] <Crix> and thats my gambit
[10:06] <Crix> I'm about to go to 4x4 columns...
[10:06] <Zedo_Mann> I need diamonds.
[10:06] <Crix> but theres multiple reasons why 3x3 is easier
[10:06] <Jackal> nice chariot
[10:06] <Zedo_Mann> never had and diamonds.
[10:06] <Crix> I have about 50 diamonds currently
[10:06] <chariot> thanks
[10:06] <Zedo_Mann> I want to see infdev mp like a mmo

[12:55] <Greenslimy> infdev is really good, I just noticed that :/
[12:55] <N3X15> yeah
[12:55] <GoaLitiuM> y
[12:56] <N3X15> Mob spawning was nerfed a bit though
[12:56] <Greenslimy> although its reallllly hard o find minerals
[12:56] <Scrippy> It has always been really good.
[12:56] <GoaLitiuM> haven't seen any monsters since the mob "tweak" update
[12:56] <Greenslimy> oh well im on peaceful mode
[12:56] <NinjaPope> It is, though I play peaceful so the mob spawning nerf does me good because of fewer sheeps and pigs.
[12:56] <Scrippy> Man where have you been.
[12:57] <Greenslimy> *cough* Xbox lol
[12:57] <Scrippy> I never know where to build anymore =\
[12:57] <N3X15> When you find awesome terrain, you'll know where to build.
[12:58] <Scrippy> I walk for days
[12:58] <NinjaPope> There isn't much awesome terrain any more.
[12:58] <Scrippy> And it is never quite right.
[12:58] <Scrippy> I think he needs to raise the map height limit.
[12:58] <N3X15> like, I found a spot where it looked like someone bending over
[12:58] <Scrippy> and make mountains more mountain-y.
[12:58] <N3X15> scrippy: chunk size is 16x16x128
[12:59] <N3X15> if you were to make that any higher it would make the map saves stupidly huge
[12:59] <N3X15> on the order of GB instead of MB
[12:59] <NinjaPope> Maybe 10 higher...
[12:59] <Scrippy> Now I know nothing aboot programming,
[12:59] <N3X15> People'd still whine about the height
[13:00] <Scrippy> But does making vertically smaller chunks horribly complicate things?
[13:00] <NinjaPope> People will always complain anyways...
[13:01] <Greenslimy> I have an underground hideout so it's all good
[13:01] <N3X15> Plus, every block is stored in memory
[13:01] <Greenslimy> Underground is the best
[13:01] <Scrippy> I prefer aboveground
[13:01] <Scrippy> Floating structures, huge trees, etc.
[13:01] <N3X15> 16 * 16 * 128 = 32768
[13:01] <N3X15> + lighting * verticies + textures + entities
[13:01] <Scrippy> Yes that is a lot of blocks.

[17:06] <ZaxKellens> Agreed
[17:06] <Willerin> yeah but, my castle, my baby ;-;
[17:07] <ZaxKellens> Oh well, remake it
[17:07] <LordQuorad> maxheight, does it need to be larger?
[17:07] <ZaxKellens> You should've known it would happen one day
[17:07] <ZaxKellens> LordQuorad : Nope
[17:07] <LordQuorad> it will happen again later too.
[17:07] <LordQuorad> I'm sure of it.
[17:07] <Willerin> yeah well you know you're gonna die one day doesnt make you any less sad
[17:07] <Marach> LordQuorad: the default is good, but it should be adjustable
[17:07] <LordQuorad> adjustable? for infdev?
[17:07] <Marach> or infinite :D

[17:10] <ZaxKellens> We need something to do with flowers =\
[17:10] <ZaxKellens> They're so boring
[17:10] <Marach> Notch already decided on all the *good* ideas
[17:10] <ZaxKellens> (I throw them in lava or water and be done with them)
[17:10] <LordQuorad> They're pretty.
[17:11] <LordQuorad> Put them in a vase.
[17:11] <Chemo> we need a default skin that isnt a black guy
[17:11] <Marach> they can be reskinned to chains
[17:11] <LordQuorad> then change your skin
[17:11] <ZaxKellens> Don't like black people Chemo?
[17:11] <LordQuorad> it's not hard.
[17:11] <LordQuorad> I'm a mage.
[17:11] <ZaxKellens> My character is Gordon Freeman
[17:11] <LordQuorad> lol
[17:11] <Marach> also, they can be used as temporary air pockets
[17:11] <LordQuorad> awesome.
[17:12] <Marach> ZaxKellens: snowman's skin?
[17:12] <ZaxKellens> Marach : I can't remember, I found it on the skin site
[17:12] <Marach> ha, then it isn't yours
[17:12] <Chemo> no i dont ZaxKellens
[17:12] <ZaxKellens> It's my character
[17:12] <ZaxKellens> Just someone elses skin
[17:12] <Chemo> notch made the default skin black to force people to buy the game
[17:12] <ZaxKellens> I took their character, killed it, and am wearing its skin
[17:12] <Marach> i know
[17:12] <Marach> i made&use a Kazuma skin

[17:15] <ZaxKellens> Flowing Water, that's all
[17:15] <ZaxKellens> But it's not a glitch really
[17:16] <LordQuorad> I think that can be resolved with water acting not in full 1x1x1 cubes, but in half blocks like the stepping stones, what do you think?
[17:16] <TrueWolves> ...
[17:16] <TrueWolves> Notch hates half blocks. XD

[17:17] <LordQuorad> alright, water stays as it is then.
[17:17] <ZaxKellens> That stupid thing is gonna make me go crazy
[17:17] <ZaxKellens> We needs weather
[17:17] <ZaxKellens> Move slower in rain/snow
[17:17] <LordQuorad> how would weather interact with the terrain?
[17:18] <LordQuorad> and inside tunnels and houses?
[17:18] <LordQuorad> I would imagine it would be difficult to impliment.
[17:18] <ZaxKellens> Inside houses and tunnels it wouldn't do anything
[17:18] <LordQuorad> but what defines a house? lol
[17:18] <ZaxKellens> Roof
[17:18] <LordQuorad> what about an overhang?
[17:18] <ZaxKellens> Is a roof
[17:18] <ZaxKellens> Basically
[17:18] <LordQuorad> would that prevent weather?
[17:18] <ZaxKellens> Of course
[17:19] <LordQuorad> what about a roof, but no walls?
[17:19] <LordQuorad> that shouldn't prevent weather.

[17:20] <ZaxKellens> Raint helps crops and trees grow quicker, snow hinders them and causes the top of terrain to become white, like snow is accumulating
[17:21] <ZaxKellens> That part would be harder to do
[17:21] <TrueWolves> Snow and rain are already planned

[17:21] <ZaxKellens> How about hail that can damage you or your house? =O
[17:21] <LordQuorad> no
[17:21] <LordQuorad> then it would damage all terrain.
[17:22] <ZaxKellens> Hn
[17:22] <ZaxKellens> Then damages planks, wood, leaves, and entities
[17:22] <LordQuorad> it would destroy trees.
[17:22] <ZaxKellens> That's fine
[17:22] <LordQuorad> do they regrow the leaves?
[17:22] <ZaxKellens> Hail can destroy trees
[17:22] <LordQuorad> rofl
[17:22] <LordQuorad> no way, you'd have a barren landscape.
[17:22] <ZaxKellens> I've seen hail take a tree down

[17:23] <LordQuorad> uh
[17:24] <Marach> so you finished with ideas that make sense?
[17:24] <LordQuorad> so that means you have to build your base out of stone or inside of a cliff or hill.
[17:24] <ZaxKellens> Marach : Yes
[17:24] <LordQuorad> yes.
[17:24] <ZaxKellens> Now are my funny ideas
[17:24] <Marach> :D
[17:24] <LordQuorad> I'm still taking serious suggestions.
[17:24] <ZaxKellens> If the tornado hits a dirt or stone 3 blocks high it has a chance of dissapating
[17:25] <LordQuorad> lol
[17:25] <LordQuorad> it'd stir up the landscape pretty bad.
[17:25] <LordQuorad> it's not a lazor beam.
[17:25] <ZaxKellens> Lazor~
[17:25] <Marach> LordQuorad: "custom terrain" menu with advanced generation settings?
[17:25] <ZaxKellens> Alien space ships that come down and use lazors to destroy your landscape intermittenly
[17:26] <LordQuorad> Marach: added.
[17:26] <ZaxKellens> One thing needed though, in seriousness, an ingame map

[17:28] <LordQuorad> giant mobs?
[17:28] <ZaxKellens> A.k.a. there WERE giant mob?
[17:28] <Jackomel> back? does that mean they were in?
[17:28] <ZaxKellens> You lie
[17:28] <vede> I know it makes me a bit elitist, but I really hate when people respond to my comments and try to act like they're informing be about something regarding Minecraft, like they've been with it longer or they keep more track of the development than I do.
[17:28] <kaos86> how about a mob boss?
[17:28] <Marach> yeah
[17:28] <Marach> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiqneDn-VqM
[17:28] <LordQuorad> I was thinking giving spiders the ability to climb.
[17:28] <ZaxKellens> vede : What you mean?
[17:28] <ZaxKellens> Spiders should be able to climb
[17:29] <kaos86> that would make me paranoid

[17:29] <ZaxKellens> That'd be fun
[17:29] <ZaxKellens> I waaant....
[17:29] <ZaxKellens> Bricks to be craftable
[17:29] <ZaxKellens> And beds, etc, random things like that
[17:30] <kaos86> pfff, huge mobs should be able to destroy buildings and cause terror to your infdev level
[17:30] <ZaxKellens> ssssboom already does that
[17:30] <ZaxKellens> We need a huge ssssboom =O
[17:30] <ZaxKellens> No, that's a lie
[17:30] <vede> For example, my blog comment a while back about Notch starting to forget the point of in*dev (how he's waiting to update instead of them actually being in development and unstable), and someone said that I didn't understand the idea behind infdev, and they explained how infdev was basically the new 'in development' branch and how indev was no longer being worked on.
[17:30] <LordQuorad> lol
[17:30] <vede> Because I totally did not know that before, right?
[17:30] <Marach> vede: it's hard to be elitist
[17:31] <ZaxKellens> sssssboom
[17:31] <Marach> once upon a time, there was no survival
[17:31] <vede> I'll prolly sound a bit smug, but I really doubt many people in the community know more about Minecraft than I do.
[17:31] <Marach> and it was good
[17:31] <kaos86> a big ssssboom is over 9000!
[17:32] <ZaxKellens> A ssssboom that was 4 blocks high
[17:32] <ZaxKellens> I'd quit almost o.o;
[17:32] <Marach> vede: same
[17:32] <Marach> but you've been here for longer.
[17:32] <ZaxKellens> My knowledge of minecraft : It's fun
[17:32] <ZaxKellens> That's about it
[17:32] <kaos86> indeed
[17:32] <Marach> it used to be awesome
[17:32] <kaos86> i agree
[17:32] <vede> And the people who've been with it longer than I have and are still in the community can be counted on two hands.
[17:32] <LordQuorad> How can we make it more fun?
[17:33] <Marach> kill hacks
[17:33] <kaos86> add more stuff
[17:33] <kaos86> and that ^
[17:33] <ZaxKellens> More fun?
[17:33] <Marach> that was the thing that killed it
[17:33] <ZaxKellens> Minigames for crafting =O
[17:33] <Marach> :/
[17:33] <ZaxKellens> (That's a joke btw)
[17:33] <vede> I also think it's a bit funny that someone would say that I didn't understand the idea behind indev, because I'm, like, the one who suggested the feature to Notch.
[17:34] <LordQuorad> ha
[17:34] <Marach> ha
[17:34] <ZaxKellens> A crafting level with a chance of failing if you're making something crazy when you just recently started
[17:34] <kaos86> if Notch can enable multiplayer survival, my world will be awsome.
[17:34] <Marach> notch implemented my idea of item wear bars

[17:36] <Chemo> i've been here for 9 years
[17:36] <kaos86> zax, you should advise notch to do that
[17:36] <Marach> Chemo: o_O
[17:36] <ZaxKellens> It won't happen
[17:36] <kaos86> why?
[17:36] <ZaxKellens> Because it's overpowered
[17:37] <Ten_Tacles> Other games have adamantinum.
[17:37] <Ten_Tacles> We have adminum.
[17:37] <Ten_Tacles> :D
[17:37] <kaos86> maybe notch should make a blacksmith repair table.
[17:37] <Marach> i joined on the very first mention on tigsource
[17:37] <Ten_Tacles> Wtf
[17:37] <kaos86> repair all weapons
[17:37] <Budda> maybe notch should make multiplayer survival
[17:37] <LordQuorad> vede, do you like where the development is headed?
[17:37] <kaos86> i said that budda
[17:37] <ZaxKellens> Notch should do whatever he wants
[17:38] <vede> LordQuorad, absolutely.
[17:38] <Marach> multiplayer was already out

[17:38] <vede> ZaxKellens, acting like we shouldn't give Notch advice or suggestions is just stupid.
[17:38] <Chemo> notch should implement hats
[17:38] <ZaxKellens> I know that, but we shouldn't say he SHOULD do it
[17:38] <Marach> we should give him suggestions when he's actually here...
[17:38] <ZaxKellens> That we say it'd be cool to have

[17:39] <ZaxKellens> Suggestions, not demands
[17:39] <vede> Most of what Minecraft is right now is the result of Notch coming here and tossing ideas out to us so we can tear them apart and make them better.
[17:39] <Marach> or vice versa
[17:39] <bildramer> "I'm hoping people bring vuvuzelas to the Microsoft press conference tomorrow"
[17:39] <vede> ZaxKellens, I think you're just being too picky with vocabulary.

[17:40] <ZaxKellens> How about a dog that can keep some hostile mobs away from your base?
[17:40] <vede> Yep.
[17:40] <LordQuorad> why do the mobs attack me and not the sheep and pigs?
[17:40] <Chemo> they're humanitarians
[17:40] <kaos86> good idea zax.
[17:41] <ZaxKellens> Hostile mobs should be hostile to everything, agreed
[17:41] <ZaxKellens> And some mobs should be hostile to hostile mobs only
[17:41] <ZaxKellens> If that makes sense
[17:41] <Marach> notch should implement physx engine

[17:45] <ZaxKellens> You should be able to make a dagger, like a sword but one less iron/wood/gold, etc
[17:45] <vede> Notch once said (right after No More Sweden 2010, I think) that he would implement custom arrow graphics.
[17:45] <LordQuorad> a dagger huh?
[17:46] <Viral> i remember when i wrote the bible. i also remember forgetting to add in the page saying 'this novel is purely fictional, all characters and stories portrayed are in no way representaions of real world events / people.
[17:46] <vede> So you could change your arrows like you change your skin.
[17:46] <LordQuorad> stabby stabby
[17:46] <ZaxKellens> Yes, dagger, stabby stabby
[17:46] <ZaxKellens> Or do it upside down and you get throwing knives

[17:47] <ZaxKellens> Isn't notch engaged/married or sumin?
[17:47] <Chemo> no his wife is a lie
[17:47] <vede> ZaxKellens, engaged with ez/Elin.
[17:47] <ZaxKellens> vede : Does that work with ssssboom too?

[17:48] <ZaxKellens> ssssboom is what I call them, yes
[17:48] <Chemo> because notch is a virgin
[17:48] <ZaxKellens> Will they try to esplode if they're in water and you're below them not in water?

[17:49] <vede> Viral, I'm pretty sure we were talking about Notch's marital status.
[17:50] <Viral> Chemo wasn't.

[17:54] <vede> Really, repairing has been suggested every since items were implemented.
[17:54] <vede> Before, actually.
[17:54] <vede> And Notch has said numerous times that he doesn't want people to repair stuff.
[17:55] <Chemo> oh i got an idea
[17:55] <vede> He wants people to be forced to make new things often.
[17:55] <Chemo> how about repairing items
[17:55] <LordQuorad> ah okay vede

[17:55] <kaos86> how about crafting boats?
[17:55] <Cintiq> that's fair enough i guess

[17:55] <ZaxKellens> Crafting furniture ftw
[17:55] <Cintiq> that when you made stuff with it
[17:55] <Cintiq> was indestructable
[17:55] <Cintiq> EXCEPT

[17:55] <LordQuorad> added boats.
[17:55] <Cintiq> slightly slower mining time
[17:56] <kaos86> no way
[17:56] <kaos86> mining has taken my life already
[17:56] <Cintiq> and takes 3 days to smelt
