[0:00] <gdude2002|away> What sad person reported that epic song?
[0:00] <bildramer> <Marach> cpu fan is at almost-max setting on 100% load
[0:00] <bildramer> gdude, what the fuck

[0:00] <bildramer> that guy has no copyrights and shit
[0:00] <bildramer> who the hell is Jacob Cable

[0:00] <Gunmage> ^
[0:00] <gdude2002|away> I know, but it's down
[0:00] <gdude2002|away> for that reason
[0:00] <Marach> the cpu never gets hot enough so fan can't handle
[0:00] <Azrooh> fnugget, it's the same reason nobody really cares about creative anymore.
[0:00] <bildramer> well, post a formal complaint
[0:00] <Marach> it's just right
[0:00] <gdude2002|away> Thankfully, I found a reupload
[0:00] <gdude2002|away> :D
[0:00] <Marach> <Azrooh> fnugget, it's the same reason nobody really cares about creative anymore.

[1:24] <CyborgDragon> not entirely siretrm
[1:24] <Ominus> only on snow
[1:24] <CyborgDragon> koko found a cave with a sand roof
[1:24] <Ominus> i mean when snow spawns on top
[1:24] <CyborgDragon> ah
[1:24] <CyborgDragon> that would be why
[1:25] <Risugami> so basically snow enables physics on gravity affected blocks
[1:25] * Doctor_Headcrab (chatzilla@79-69-156-118.dynamic.dsl.as9105.com) has joined #minecraft
[1:25] <CyborgDragon> not really, its just the snow spawning on top
[1:25] <Risugami> yea, when it spawns it enables it
[1:25] <CyborgDragon> it only enables it because of how the snow generation works
[1:26] <CyborgDragon> if it were created in the generation along with everything else
[1:26] <CyborgDragon> it wouldnt enable it
[1:26] <CyborgDragon> but apparently snow is created post-generation, post-spawning
[1:26] <Ominus> this is fun, render distance set on tiny and difficulty on hard + snow, feels like true winter

[1:57] <ClassiestMedic> a single TNT drops from the ceiling

[1:58] <ClassiestMedic> TNT under the floor

[1:58] <ClassiestMedic> You could make a narrow passage

[2:02] <Beardbeard> without it becoming solid
[2:02] <CyborgDragon> the only blocks you can make translucent are water, lava, and ice!
[2:02] <ClassiestMedic> who is a minecraft GENIUS
[2:02] <Beardbeard> Lava isn't translucent
[2:02] <CyborgDragon> classiest, just give up
[2:02] <CyborgDragon> beardbeard, you can make it
[2:02] <Beardbeard> Medic stop trolling again
[2:02] <ClassiestMedic> Why? I'm telling the truth

[2:05] <Beardbeard> you can't even tell us the name of your supposed magic program?
[2:05] <ClassiestMedic> I can't
[2:05] <ClassiestMedic> Beard, there is no name
[2:05] <Utriax> wut.
[2:05] <ClassiestMedic> it's just a little program
[2:05] <ClassiestMedic> It doesn't have a name
[2:05] <Beardbeard> It just so happens that your friend sent you a nameless program
[2:05] <ClassiestMedic> It's like microsoft paint
[2:05] <ClassiestMedic> but better
[2:05] <ClassiestMedic> now BRB
[2:05] <CyborgDragon> classiest, there is a difference between transparecy and translucency
[2:05] <Rooster> What exactly do different difficulties do?
[2:05] <Beardbeard> make you take more damage
[2:06] <CyborgDragon> transparency is full alpha
[2:06] <Beardbeard> also your stuff disappears faster if you die on hard

[2:06] <Azrael-> that looks pretty broken
[2:06] <Beardbeard> bil
[2:06] <Beardbeard> tell me how you did that
[2:06] <Beardbeard> it looks awesome
[2:06] <CyborgDragon> and also, classiest, unlike creative, alpha has face culling, if you cant see the face, it is culled, period.
[2:06] <bildramer> uuuh
[2:06] <bildramer> NBTedit
[2:06] <ClassiestMedic> nice bill
[2:07] <bildramer> 20000000, 20000000
[2:07] <Helar> looks like a town bild
[2:07] <CyborgDragon> meaning if a block is behind another block, it's culled, you cant see it
[2:07] <bildramer> ok
[2:07] <bildramer> hm
[2:07] <bildramer> now what
[2:07] <CyborgDragon> even if you make it transparent or translucent
[2:07] <bildramer> we know when the map gen really breaks
[2:07] <Azrael-> CyborgDragon: How does the game handle, for example, glass blocks?
[2:07] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[2:07] <ClassiestMedic> that's the map gen?
[2:07] <bildramer> 7000000 works, 20000000 not
[2:07] <bildramer> yes
[2:07] <Beardbeard> You can make a block transparent and see through it if only air is on the other side
[2:07] <bildramer> of course
[2:07] <ClassiestMedic> wow
[2:07] <bildramer> also, I usually get over 100 fps
[2:07] <CyborgDragon> glass are considered air by the render engine
[2:07] <ClassiestMedic> what the fuck did you do to it??!!
[2:07] <Beardbeard> If another block is there you can't see said block
[2:07] <bildramer> I wonder why it fails

[2:09] <Zerim> is it possible to fly in infdev?
[2:09] <ClassiestMedic> Nope

[2:09] <ClassiestMedic> True
[2:10] <ClassiestMedic> Lol
[2:10] <Azrael-> You can fly in indev with a minecraft tracks and a large ramp.
[2:10] <Helar> it would be cool if infdev was shaped like a planet
[2:10] <ClassiestMedic> But then how does he get back down

[2:15] <ClassiestMedic> yeah

[2:15] <ClassiestMedic> it's almost 3d

[2:16] <Maart> i know
[2:16] <Maart> to get somebodys location
[2:16] <CyborgDragon> the idea that the 4th dimension is time is outdated
[2:16] <Azrael-> SireTRM: I think he's referring to a fourth spatial dimension.
[2:16] <Eagle> 4D probably exists, somehow I really doubt it's time.
[2:16] <Maart> you need dimensions
[2:16] <bildramer> um
[2:16] <bildramer> guys
[2:16] <SireTRM> Azrael-, I understand
[2:16] <Maart> z y x and time
[2:16] <CyborgDragon> mathematically there is an infinite number of dimenbsions
[2:16] <Beardbeard> We can't tell whether or not it exists
[2:16] <ClassiestMedic> We can move in any direction in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dimensions. We are moving forward in the 4th dimension, and we are anchored in place in the 5th dimension
[2:16] <Beardbeard> because we can't see it
[2:16] <bildramer> you do understand that 4D means we're nothing
[2:16] <SireTRM> Maart, exactly.
[2:16] <bildramer> no, fuck time
[2:16] <CyborgDragon> <CyborgDragon> mathematically there is an infinite number of dimenbsions
[2:17] <bildramer> time is not a spatial dimension
[2:17] <ClassiestMedic> No there isn't
[2:17] <SireTRM> Universes, maybe, CyborgDragon
[2:17] <Azrael-> CyborgDragon: Who said that we're living in Hilbert space?
[2:17] <ClassiestMedic> There are 10 dimensions
[2:17] <bildramer> CyborgDragon, that's an extremely flawed definition
[2:17] <FNugget> If you can catch a ball that I throw at you, you have a grasp on the 4th dimension (time)

[2:18] <Beardbeard> if we could see in 4 dimensions
[2:18] <ClassiestMedic> It's not time per se
[2:18] <Maart> sorry for feeding beard
[2:18] <Eagle> If you could see in 4D (assuming it's time) you would see every moment in time at once. Or something. I heard that somewhere.
[2:18] <Utriax> Oh oke ;p
[2:18] <bildramer> well

[2:18] <bildramer> there's TIME

[2:18] <Maart> i still think xbox is better
[2:18] <SireTRM> [WE NEED SOME CITATIONS. LINK LINK LINK PLEASE?]
[2:18] <bildramer> then there are SPATIAL DIMENSIONS

[2:18] <bildramer> ClassiestMedit, no.
[2:18] <bildramer> c*
[2:19] <ClassiestMedic> HERE IS A VIDEO ABOUT ALL 10 DIMENSIONS http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkxieS-6WuA
[2:19] * Maart (Maart3h@86.92.114.65) Quit (Quit: Quitting)
[2:19] <Beardbeard> We can barely see 3 dimensions
[2:19] <CyborgDragon> mathematically, there an are infinite number of dimensions, spacially, within this universe, there are only 3, then there's time, which isn't a dimension at all
[2:19] <Eagle> Your opinion MAY NOT BE FACT OOOO SPOOKY RIGHT
[2:19] <ClassiestMedic> Yes there is bil
[2:19] * Maart3h (Maart3h@86.92.114.65) has joined #minecraft
[2:19] <ClassiestMedic> look at above video
[2:19] <FNugget> ClassiestMedic: Its a theory, it's not a proof.
[2:19] <CyborgDragon> <CyborgDragon> mathematically, there an are infinite number of dimensions, spacially, within this universe, there are only 3, then there's time, which isn't a dimension at all
[2:19] <SireTRM> Theories!
[2:19] <GoaLitiuM> "2D person" can only see a slice of 3D-object, therefore "3D-person" can see a slice of 4D-object.
[2:19] <bildramer> that video is just an example of how they would look like
[2:19] <ClassiestMedic> If you are right
[2:19] <Utriax> mah gawd fractals..
[2:19] <ClassiestMedic> How can we prove there ARE dimensions
[2:19] <Maart3h> whats a dimension?
[2:19] <bildramer> oh god
[2:19] <DEElekgolo> GoaLitiuM is right
[2:19] <Beardbeard> GoaL, we can't see 4D at all
[2:19] <Sliker> 4th dimension is minecraft.
[2:19] <SireTRM> Quick, argue interdimensional physics theories in IRC!
[2:19] <DEElekgolo> for instant
[2:19] <Beardbeard> our eyes can barely see 3 dimensions
[2:19] <bildramer> oh god
[2:19] <Moocman> Hell
[2:19] <ClassiestMedic> We are seeing 4th dimension
[2:19] <Moocman> http://grab.by/5mwd
[2:19] <Azrael-> ClassiestMedic: the existence of particles that can travel through them.
[2:19] <CyborgDragon> GoaLitiuM is right
[2:19] <bildramer> 1. this isn't complicated
[2:19] <Moocman> This is realistic!
[2:19] <Beardbeard> past 20 feet our eyes start seeing 2D again
[2:19] <bildramer> 2. you're making it complicated
[2:20] <Moocman> Woops
[2:20] <Moocman> Wrong one
[2:20] <Moocman> http://grab.by/5mwC
[2:20] <Beardbeard> within 20 feet we get pseudo 3d
[2:20] <DEElekgolo> Beardbeard, the 4th dimension is passing through out dimension
[2:20] <CyborgDragon> we see a slice of the 4th dimension, meaning the 4th dimension itself is probably the multiverse
[2:20] <DEElekgolo> we see it as time
[2:20] <ClassiestMedic> We see steady movement THROUGH the 4th dimension
[2:20] * Utriax is now known as Utriax|being4D
[2:20] <Maart3h> but really
[2:20] <bildramer> .........
[2:20] <Utriax|being4D> brb
[2:20] <bildramer> no.
[2:20] <ClassiestMedic> If we could see in 4d
[2:20] <Maart3h> bearbeard, ur a troll
[2:20] <bildramer> time != 4th D
[2:20] <Azrael-> ClassiestMedic: We don't see it, we have a memory of it.
[2:20] <bildramer> fuck time
[2:20] <Beardbeard> I'm not trolling
[2:20] <ClassiestMedic> we could see anything that has and will happen
[2:20] <Beardbeard> I'm bringing up an interesting discussion
[2:20] <bildramer> leave time out when we're talking about SPACE
[2:20] <DEElekgolo> look
[2:20] <DEElekgolo> guys
[2:20] <CyborgDragon> WHO KEEPS SAYING TIME IS THE FOURTH DIMENSION
[2:20] <DEElekgolo> if a 3d object
[2:20] <DEElekgolo> ok
[2:20] <Azrael-> And besides, if time is another dimension, why do we have no control over our position in it like we do the other dimensions?
[2:20] <Maart3h> i started that
[2:20] <GoaLitiuM> it's really hard, maybe impossible to 'see' the 4th dimension
[2:20] <Beardbeard> Time isn't really a spatial dimension guys
[2:20] <Maart3h> for the lolz
[2:20] <bildramer> ...
[2:20] <Azrael-> Why can't we look forwards in time just as we can look forwards in space?
[2:20] <DEElekgolo> if a pie apple was to intersect with the 2nd dimension
[2:21] <bildramer> we have 3 dimensions
[2:21] <Beardbeard> Because we can't see in that dimension azrael
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> this is what they would say
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> http://www.geekosystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/pineapple-mri.gif
[2:21] <bildramer> end of discussion
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> pineapple*
[2:21] <GoaLitiuM> i mean comprehend
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> see*
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> fuuu
[2:21] <Eagle> bildramer, I would like proof that you are the only correct person here
[2:21] <bildramer> Eagle, what.
[2:21] <Maart3h> http://www.youtube.com/user/failblog
[2:21] <Eagle> because
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> ok
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> if
[2:21] <CyborgDragon> eagle, im agreeing with bildramer
[2:21] <Maart3h> people gettign hurt
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> an orange was to pass
[2:21] <Maart3h> so you dont have too
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> the second dimension
[2:21] <Eagle> Cyborg you misunderstood what I said
[2:21] <ClassiestMedic> pineappleMRI is awesome
[2:21] <ClassiestMedic> :D
[2:21] <CyborgDragon> the 4th dimension is not time, that theory has been disproven
[2:21] <Beardbeard> You can't be right in an argument about the 4th dimension
[2:21] <bildramer> there are 3 spatial dimensions, if there were more we would be aware of it
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> the 2nd dimension people would see this
[2:21] <DEElekgolo> http://www.geekosystem.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/orange-mri.gif
[2:21] <Beardbeard> because everything is a theory
[2:21] <Eagle> bildramer, we are 3D people
[2:21] <bildramer> Beardbeard, fuck you
[2:21] <Eagle> have you ever heard of flatland?
[2:22] <Beardbeard> why so hostile?
[2:22] <bildramer> yup
[2:22] <Maart3h> bild
[2:22] <FNugget> Theres three dimensions of space. Theres 4 dimensions in spacetime.

[2:22] <Eagle> 2D people can't see 3D, so they assume it doesn't exist
[2:22] <bildramer> flatland is in an universe
[2:22] <Maart3h> he gets a boner of this
[2:22] <FNugget> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime
[2:22] <Maart3h> let him
[2:22] <DDRJake> flatland?
[2:22] <CyborgDragon> thank you fnugget
[2:22] <Maart3h> some like girls, some like this
[2:22] <Eagle> 3D people like you cant see 4D, so you assume it doesn't exist
[2:22] <bildramer> well, there would be 3D objects constantly intersecting flatland
[2:22] <Beardbeard> Maart I don't know what your problem is.
[2:22] <Beardbeard> I just want an interesting discussion.
[2:22] <bildramer> in a non-fictional universe
[2:22] <Beardbeard> Which is what this is.
[2:22] <Maart3h> i got no problems -.-
[2:22] <ClassiestMedic> People, If we were to pass through the 2nd dimension, a 2D person would see an infinitely thin slice of us. Since time goes one way, we see an infinitely thin slice of time. This is called the present.
[2:22] <bildramer> Beardbeard, go to #furry or something
[2:22] <Azrael-> It's possible to build Turing-complete systems in two- and three-dimensional space. Is it possible to do the same in one-dimensional space?
[2:22] <ClassiestMedic> We can't see more than one infinityeth of time at once
[2:22] <Maart3h> u dont got problems either, u just get a --- from this
[2:22] <FNugget> CyborgDragon, bildramer: Your issue is you're not being clear what the dimensions are of.
[2:23] <Beardbeard> I'm not sure who pissed in your cheerios, bild.
[2:23] <ClassiestMedic> just as a 2d person would see one infinityeth of us
[2:23] <bildramer> what
[2:23] <Beardbeard> But just because you can't handle not being right in a discussion of pure theory
[2:23] <SireTRM> VOXELS.
[2:23] <Helar> lol its fun to set your speakers to max at 1:23 AM
[2:23] <Beardbeard> doesn't mean you need to be so hostile
[2:23] <bildramer> >pure theory
[2:23] <bildramer> STOP TROLLING MAN
[2:23] <Maart3h> hehe
[2:23] <Animator> Bildramer, knock it off.
[2:23] <Beardbeard> Nothing about the 4th dimension can be proven
[2:23] <CyborgDragon> what fnugget just linked you all would tell you all that there are: an infinite number of spacial dimensions when it comes to math, only 3 spacial dimensions in reality, and 4 dimensions in spacetime(a different thing than space)
[2:23] <Beardbeard> Because we can't properly understand it
[2:23] <bildramer> ...
[2:23] <Beardbeard> Thus, everything is theory
[2:23] <ClassiestMedic> People, If we were to pass through the 2nd dimension, a 2D person would see an infinitely thin slice of us. Since time goes one way, we see an infinitely thin slice of time. This is called the present. Just as a 2D person sees only 1/infinity of us at once, we can see only 1/infinity of time at once.
[2:23] <bildramer> this is the same thing people are saying about evolution, and it is the same kind of JUST WRONG
[2:24] <FNugget> ClassiestMedic: Shut up. That video is still just theory
[2:24] <Maart3h> im glad i banned you a long time ago beard, u are a troll
[2:24] <Beardbeard> banned me from what?
[2:24] <ClassiestMedic> maarth, from what server?
[2:24] <Beardbeard> I'm not sure what you mean.
[2:24] <bildramer> see, if stuff was 4-dimensional, we would have 4-dimensional eyes and stuff
[2:24] <Maart3h> i know
[2:24] <Eagle> bildramer, so far I have seen you argue that 4D doesn't exist because... because.
[2:24] <Maart3h> to zombie
[2:24] <Azrael-> ClassiestMedic: So you're claiming that time is exactly the same type of dimension as the spatial ones?
[2:24] <bildramer> Let's explain
[2:24] <Eagle> Yes.
[2:24] <Beardbeard> I got unbanned because they saw that the ban reason was stupid.
[2:24] <Eagle> Go ahead.
[2:24] <bildramer> Say we have a 4-dimensional universe, we're a 3D slice of it
[2:24] <Beardbeard> I called some guy out for cheating
[2:24] <FNugget> Eagle: we're stictly talking about space, not spacetime
[2:24] <ClassiestMedic> Spatiality and time are the same thing
[2:24] <Maart3h> are u unbanned on there?
[2:24] <Beardbeard> you told me to fuck off and got an op there
[2:25] <ClassiestMedic> Time is just another iteration of space
[2:25] <Beardbeard> And then told said op that I was talking shit about him or something
[2:25] <Maart3h> lol
[2:25] <bildramer> Now if there's something except our 3D slice, stuff would intersect with our slice
[2:25] <ClassiestMedic> just as space is just another iteration of a sheet of paper
[2:25] <Maart3h> dude
[2:25] <bildramer> lots and lots of times
[2:25] <Beardbeard> For reasons that are still unknown
[2:25] <CyborgDragon> bildramer, what was the location again?
[2:25] <Maart3h> get out of your wank fantasy
[2:25] <bildramer> but nothing does.
[2:25] <ClassiestMedic> maarth
[2:25] <ClassiestMedic> can you do me a favor
[2:25] <Eagle> bildramer, how do you know?
[2:25] <CyborgDragon> 2,000,000; 127; 2,000,000
[2:25] <ClassiestMedic> I think I'm banned in theone's build
[2:25] <CyborgDragon> is that right bild?
[2:25] <Azrael-> ClassiestMedic: Then how do you define velocity?
[2:25] <ClassiestMedic> could you find out WHY?
[2:25] <Maart3h> make a ban apeal
[2:25] <Maart3h> theonemcft.com
[2:25] <bildramer> If we're a 3D subset of a 4D universe, and there's nothing else in other positions, we may just call it a 3D universe
[2:25] <CyborgDragon> bildramer, you said 2 million, yes?
[2:25] <ClassiestMedic> No, I don't NOT want to get unbanned
[2:25] <Moocman> What the hell is this...
[2:25] <Moocman> http://grab.by/5mwR
[2:25] <ClassiestMedic> or whatever
[2:26] <ClassiestMedic> I just want to know why i WAS banned
[2:26] <bildramer> if there is something else, it would surely interact with ours
[2:26] <Moocman> I found it in my world
[2:26] <Azrael-> Moocman: that's a mob spawner
[2:26] <Eagle> bildramer, just because you can't see whatever 4D shenanigans are going on doesn't mean there aren't 4D shenanigans.
[2:26] <Moocman> ....
[2:26] <Azrael-> it spawns pigs around it randomly
[2:26] <bildramer> ...
[2:26] <Moocman> ... why?
[2:26] <DEElekgolo> umm
[2:26] <Maart3h> no idea
[2:26] <Beardbeard> What Eagle said
[2:26] <DEElekgolo> what
[2:26] <ClassiestMedic> kk
[2:26] <Eagle> I mean, I have no right so say there is.
[2:26] <Maart3h> dont know about build server
[2:26] <Eagle> *are
[2:26] <Eagle> but
[2:26] <DEElekgolo> the first 3 dimensions only define position
[2:26] <Eagle> you know
[2:26] <ClassiestMedic> Jesus fuck it's hard to have a convo ehre
[2:26] <Eagle> neither do you
[2:26] <Beardbeard> As humans we need to advance our understanding of the world around us
[2:26] <CyborgDragon> ENOUGH
[2:26] <ClassiestMedic> what with people squabbling over dimensions and shit
[2:26] <Animator> Smart thing: Take it to query, Classy.
[2:26] <Azrael-> ClassiestMedic: i'm rather enjoying the squabbling.
[2:26] <CyborgDragon> EVERYONE, ENOUGH, SHUT UP ABOUT IT
[2:26] <bildramer> ...actually, we have overwhelming evidence to say it's 3D.
[2:26] <ClassiestMedic> Yeah
[2:26] <DEElekgolo> in the 3rd dimensions there are 3 factors to existance which define position
[2:26] <ClassiestMedic> I think I'll do that
[2:26] <DEElekgolo> in 4d space
[2:26] <Eagle> bildramer, show it to me?
[2:26] <Eagle> link?
[2:26] <bildramer> <CyborgDragon> 2,000,000; 127; 2,000,000
[2:26] <Eagle> etc?
[2:26] <Maart3h> go to #dimensions
[2:26] <bildramer> pics?
[2:27] <DEElekgolo> time is the added factor
[2:27] <DEElekgolo> k
[2:27] <FNugget> MY TITS ARE IN 4D
[2:27] <CyborgDragon> bildramer, iwas checking, is that the pos you want?
[2:27] <bildramer> yup

[3:27] <visiON> electron can go 2 ways, you don't know which way it is going until you observe it
[3:27] <Beardbeard> Nor can any theories on the formation of the universe.
[3:27] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Azrael: Teapots follow a structured logical quanta. Gods do not.
[3:27] <visiON> in theory, it could go both ways
[3:27] <visiON> until you observe it

[3:27] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Go play Minecraft
[3:27] <Beardbeard> Pfff
[3:27] <Mojo-Rizan> WHo likes a little game I call MINECRAFT!?
[3:27] <visiON> JesusCraft for him
[3:27] <vede> From what I can tell, visiON fits the first one, and Beardbeard fits the second.
[3:27] <bildramer> visiON, don't try to understand oversimplified versions of entanglement
[3:27] <leiche> shitstorm on IRC
[3:27] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I'm not even religious. I just outgrew my LOL RELIGION IS DUMB phase when I was about 13.
[3:27] <Azrael-> visiON: If you don't observe it until after it's gone one of two ways, it can be observed to have gone both.
[3:27] <Beardbeard> vision I like how you're implying that I'm religious.
[3:27] <Beardbeard> Same syrup.
[3:28] <leiche> \o/
[3:28] <Utriax> Im playing Skincraft
[3:28] <Bluelight> Do you guys like the new vision gradient in Minecraft?
[3:28] <Azrael-> Chocolatey_Syrup: Since the age of 13, I attended our school's Philosophy society. Attended by religious and non-religious alike.
[3:28] <bildramer> vintage effect?
[3:28] <Mojo-Rizan> I'm playing SexCraft and RapeLay later
[3:28] <Chocolatey_Syrup> cool story bro
[3:28] <Azrael-> It's made me less and less religious, and I wasn't religious to begin with.
[3:28] <Chocolatey_Syrup> super cool story
[3:28] <Vic> religious discussion? in my #minecraft?
[3:28] <bildramer> unfortunately, in our Philosophy class, we just see Charlie Chaplin films
[3:28] <bildramer> heck
[3:28] <leiche> riveting tale chap!
[3:28] <bildramer> he's an awesome composer
[3:28] <Vic> more like, religion
[3:29] <Vic> not religious
[3:29] <bildramer> our teacher is just wasting our time
[3:29] <Bluelight> What does it have to do with wine? bildramer
[3:29] <bildramer> wine? wut
[3:29] <Azrael-> bildramer: ask for some actual philosophy
[3:29] <visiON> ITT:atheists vs religious dumbfucks
[3:29] <Azrael-> Walk in and start a discussion about Kant.
[3:29] <Azrael-> Do it.
[3:29] <Beardbeard> vision stop trolling
[3:29] <bildramer> hm
[3:29] <leiche> dammit can you stop talking about religions & philosophy ?
[3:29] <Beardbeard> Neither I nor syrup are religious.
[3:29] <bildramer> it's the last day before holidays
[3:29] <Vic> i dunno im christian but i dont go around forcing the saving power of jesus christ on people
[3:29] <bildramer> I don't think anything will chnge
[3:29] <Vic> and that's all i have to say on that matter
[3:29] <bildramer> a*
[3:29] <Azrael-> leiche: where's the fun in that?
[3:29] <Beardbeard> We just don't subscribe to the HURR RELIJUN IS DUM mindset.
[3:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Actually Beardbeard the truth is even if I think they're "wrong" I admire a lot of strongly (by this I don't mean overzealously) religious people. It gives them purpose, it gives them meaning in their lives. It gives them something to believe in and it makes them better people for it.
[3:29] <Vic> and i'm going back to playing minecraft
[3:29] <Lutin> Vic: Agreed
[3:30] <Bluelight> Why are you guys so religious now?
[3:30] <visiON> and im going to have a smoke now
[3:30] <leiche> well there is no fun if you don't discuss with each other.

[3:30] <Lutin> Because I'm not writing in English
[3:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> In many ways I envy it, but that doesn't mean I can just jump in and follow them, because I can't have belief like that just because I want to.
[3:30] <Azrael-> Chocolatey_Syrup: If you think they're wrong, then you're respecting them for being deluded.
[3:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> They really do believe.

[3:31] <Azrael-> Chocolatey_Syrup: Ever read about absurdism?#
[3:31] <bildramer> ...
[3:31] <Beardbeard> Religions aren't absurd.

[3:31] <Azrael-> No, I'm not. And you've clearly shown that you don't know anything about absurdism if you think I'm implying that.
[3:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I can respect that devotion, drive, and selflessness. Besides, nearly all religions are at their core founded on tenets of simply being a good person. All the major religions of the world revolve around the golden rule, for instance.
[3:31] <leiche> so i have a generic question for you guys.
[3:31] <Lutin> ITT: The typical fanatic about anything who defends what he's fanatic about even if he wasn't attacked.
[3:31] <Beardbeard> Judging by your previous responses
[3:31] <leiche> WHY do people have to believe in something ?
[3:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Those who live by the tenets of those religions learn to be good people for it.
[3:32] <Beardbeard> It sounds like you would, azrael-

[3:32] <Beardbeard> Leiche, believing in something gives you a meaning to your life in a way.
[3:32] <Azrael-> Religion is absurd, but that's not what I'm saying when I mention absurdism.
[3:32] <Lutin> Beardbeard: So does being smart.
[3:32] <Beardbeard> My apologies, it seemed like you were.
[3:32] <Beardbeard> Religious people are intelligent bro.
[3:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> The hell it does, Lutin
[3:32] <leiche> Beardbeard : not just being scared of death ?
[3:32] <Beardbeard> Look at what Muslim people did.
[3:32] <Azrael-> bildramer: I'm lol'ing pretty damn hard.
[3:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> There are plenty of smart people who can't find their way in life
[3:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Are you kidding me
[3:33] <Beardbeard> They advanced our technology quite a bit.
[3:33] <bildramer> That will be your butt.
[3:33] <Chocolatey_Syrup> If intelligence and happiness/contentment/purpose were all linked, the world would be a very different place
[3:33] <Lutin> Hey, finding your way is different than having a meaning to it
[3:33] <leiche> <Beardbeard> They advanced our technology quite a bit. << with bombing the WTC ?
[3:33] <Beardbeard> Our technology, our philosophy, our knowledge of the universe
[3:33] <Chocolatey_Syrup> oh jesus
[3:33] <leiche> or disguising their wives ?
[3:33] <Beardbeard> Those were extremist muslims
[3:33] <Chocolatey_Syrup> you might as well just bring up hitler and get it over with
[3:33] <bildramer> lol
[3:33] <bildramer> godwin's law
[3:33] <Beardbeard> My god are you trolling or just
[3:33] <Beardbeard> what the hell
[3:33] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Because we've reached the point of no return
[3:33] <Lutin> Chocolatey_Syrup: Yeah, cause I wouldn't be being treated for severe clinal depression :P
[3:33] <bildramer> JEWS GOT KILLED, JEWS ARE RELATED TO RELIGION
[3:33] <bildramer> there
[3:33] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Lutin, I said SMART people
[3:33] <vede> I think there's something that anyone who's discussing anyone should face: *everything* has served to advance technology *somehow*
[3:34] <vede> That doesn't mean it's good.
[3:34] <Chocolatey_Syrup> (no I'm just kidding but that joke was too good to pass up I apologize)
[3:34] <DDRJake> someone here lied to me
[3:34] <Beardbeard> Chocolatey_Syrup you are like Hitler because
[3:34] <DDRJake> it IS still possible to tunnel through the bottom of the world and fall through into nothingness
[3:34] <Lutin> FELLOWS
[3:34] <Azrael-> Because Hitler had a pretty slick hairdo.
[3:34] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Beardbeard you are like the Crusades because you believe in Jesus
[3:34] <Lutin> WE HAVE PROVED GODWIN'S LAW
[3:34] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Are you kidding me
[3:34] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Hitler had shitty hair
[3:34] <Azrael-> (that's me approving of your style, Chocolatey_Syrup)
[3:34] <Vic> hitler was pretty cool. at least he would be
[3:34] <Beardbeard> But I do not believe in Jesus
[3:34] <Vic> if he wasn't totally insane
[3:34] <Chocolatey_Syrup> it's like, he was posing for an elementary school portrait?
[3:34] <vede> Lutin, Godwin's Law was proven long, long ago.
[3:34] <bildramer> guess what would happen if there were no jews
[3:34] <leiche> CHUCK NORRIS IS THE ONLY GOD.
[3:35] <Lutin> So was a lot of stuff
[3:35] <bildramer> well
[3:35] <bildramer> less jews*
[3:35] <Lutin> LIke that the world isn't 5000 years old
[3:35] <Vic> bil, there's this thing called an ecosystem
[3:35] <Azrael-> Yeah, he was an efficient man and a pretty awesome leader, it's just a shame that he was some an extremist powerhungry zealot.
[3:35] <bildramer> Germany would rule a large part of the world etc.
[3:35] <Lutin> But some people still refute it
[3:35] <bildramer> everyone dies etc.
[3:35] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Lutin a lot of people refuse to believe religion and science can coexist
[3:35] <Beardbeard> ITT: bildramer is dumb
[3:35] <bildramer> oh well
[3:35] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I don't, really
[3:35] <bildramer> back to homophobia
[3:35] <Beardbeard> Religion and science CAN coexist
[3:35] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I agree.
[3:35] <Beardbeard> As long as they aren't being stupid zealots for their beliefs
[3:36] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I meant I don't refuse to believe it.
[3:36] <Beardbeard> HURR RELIGION IS DUMB
[3:36] <Beardbeard> HURR SCIENCE IS DUMB
[3:36] <Azrael-> Chocolatey_Syrup: Religion and science can coexist, if you take everything in the bible to be allegorical and in ethical terms rather than literal terms.
[3:36] <Beardbeard> BLUH BLUH
[3:36] * SOFTero (SOFTero@ip72-192-86-170.ok.ok.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:36] <Azrael-> You can believe that God is a metaphor for ultimate goodness and believing in him will give your life a purpose, that's fine.
[3:36] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I generally do, Azrael.
[3:36] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I believe you can also believe in a literal God, and science.
[3:36] <Vic> well azrael, take in the fact that the bible was written by people at least three thousands years ago
[3:36] <Beardbeard> No Azrael, they can coexist if you realize that everything is a theory and cannot be proven, but you accept the merits of both points of view.
[3:36] <leiche> <Azrael-> You can believe that God is a metaphor for ultimate goodness << he killed more people than the devil in the bible O_o
[3:37] <Chocolatey_Syrup> And that makes him evil?
[3:37] <Azrael-> leiche: I was saying 'you can' as in 'if you really want to, go ahead, i won't stop you'
[3:37] <Beardbeard> Killing is not always bad.
[3:37] <Vic> the devil doesn't really kill anyway
[3:37] <Vic> it's not part of his job
[3:37] <Beardbeard> The devil is more of a corruptor
[3:37] <leiche> <Beardbeard> Killing is not always bad. << that does remind me of something...
[3:37] <Azrael-> Chocolatey_Syrup: if you believe in a literal God, then you believe in his influence on the universe.
[3:38] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@180.181.107.135) has joined #minecraft
[3:38] <Azrael-> At that point, God's getting involved in the realm of Science, and one will end up getting angry with the other.
[3:38] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Right. What was it, Deism? That believed that God created the scientific principles of the universe.
[3:38] <Beardbeard> You can believe that a religion's deity had a hand in the formation of the universe.
[3:38] <Beardbeard> Science just explains HOW said deity could have done it.
[3:38] <Chocolatey_Syrup> God set in motion the laws of evolution, the fundamental truths of mathematics and natural forces.
[3:38] <leiche> oh darn i cant stand this anymore.
[3:38] <leiche> good night have a nice day and what so ever.
[3:38] <Azrael-> Deism, the belief that Notch coded Minecraft and started the game, but isn't currently modifying the world or anything.
[3:38] <vede> Chocolatey_Syrup, I'm pretty sure Deism is the idea that some deity created the universe and physics and all that and then left and stopped caring.
[3:38] <SOFTero> as my psychology book put it, Science is how and when, Religion is who and why.

[3:39] <Beardbeard> It's a miracle
[3:39] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Let's get up another angry topic so we can get back to yelling!
[3:39] <bildramer> except random discussion
[3:39] <Chocolatey_Syrup> POLITICS
[3:39] <Azrael-> CHOCOLATEY_SYRUP IS A MUSLIM NAZI JEW
[3:39] <bildramer> lol
[3:40] <Chocolatey_Syrup> POLITICS IS THE NEW TOPIC
[3:40] <Azrael-> is that good enoguh?
[3:40] <Lutin> Hey guys
[3:40] <Beardbeard> BUSH WAS A GOOD LEADER
[3:40] <bildramer> :l
[3:40] <Azrael-> No, let's continue with religion.
[3:40] <Lutin> I just found a credit card out on the road
[3:40] <Chocolatey_Syrup> [YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS] are incorrect
[3:40] <Azrael-> I'm enjoying this.
[3:40] <Lutin> What should I do with it
[3:40] <Beardbeard> WAIT GUYS
[3:40] <bildramer> left wing ftw
[3:40] <Azrael-> Lutin: call the bank, tell them
[3:40] <Beardbeard> LET'S COMBINE POLITICS AND RELIGION
[3:40] <bildramer> wait, no
[3:40] <bildramer> I found a major flaw
[3:40] <Chocolatey_Syrup> A chatroom full of left-wing teenage atheists? on the internet? WELL I NEVER
[3:40] <bildramer> [winning side] ftw!
[3:40] <Lutin> Azrael-: I thought we established that I'm not an upstanding individual
[3:40] <Azrael-> bildramer: back to your comments about consciousness, I do have a belief that the reality we exist in is no more real than any computer simulation or dream.
[3:40] <Beardbeard> They are so hip and edgy, Syrup.
[3:40] <Vic> the card's probably blocked already
[3:41] <bildramer> hmm
[3:41] <Lutin> Doubt it
[3:41] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Okay what about this:
[3:41] <SOFTero> Only one way to find out
[3:41] <bildramer> well, there's a finite count of quantum states
[3:41] <Lutin> I just found it and took a picture of it
[3:41] <Azrael-> Lutin: I'm not sure about cards where you are, don't you need the pin number?
[3:41] <bildramer> yeah, so... hm
[3:41] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Under 30 and not liberal? No heart. Over 30 and not conservative? No brain.
[3:41] <Lutin> Picture of both sides
[3:41] <Lutin> And not with credit cards
[3:41] <Lutin> Just the front number and the security number
[3:41] <bildramer> there's a finite number of universes possible
[3:41] <bildramer> woo
[3:41] <Lutin> Which is on the card
[3:41] <Azrael-> bildramer: The rules that science establishes are only valid for this universe.
[3:42] <Beardbeard> ^
[3:42] <bildramer> what if we're on a multiverse?
[3:42] <Azrael-> Then they're all completely free to have their own rules.
[3:42] <bildramer> which means nothing in this context
[3:42] <Beardbeard> bild are you just like
[3:42] <Beardbeard> trolling?
[3:42] <Azrael-> As long as they obey the rules they have, s'all good.
[3:42] <Azrael-> In fact, somebody pointed out to me on another IRC channel
[3:42] <Chocolatey_Syrup> So wait, doesn't the channel message say "This channel is moderated. For general chatter, please go to #mcchatter. Ops: please be strict."?
[3:42] <bildramer> also, holy shit, the chance for conditions to support life on a planet is actually pretty low
[3:42] <Azrael-> The measured average universal density is startingly close to the density required for the universe to become a black hole.
[3:43] <Chocolatey_Syrup> How come no one ever enforces that
[3:43] <bildramer> which means?
[3:43] <Beardbeard> Syrup, we're allowed to discuss non-minecraft things
[3:43] <bildramer> Chocolatey_Syrup, #mcchatter is only used by people who argue it is alive
[3:43] <Beardbeard> Though, that religion shitfest was just rulebreaking retardation at the start.

[3:43] <Beardbeard> OPs just happened to be afk
[3:43] <Chocolatey_Syrup> And #mcchatter is the room for stuff like this
[3:43] <Azrael-> which would have more black holes, and in turn would be a black hole in another universe

[3:45] <Beardbeard> Lemme go find some
[3:45] <Azrael-> bildramer: Yeah, a lot of people don't seem to understand either that a) genuine racism is fucking awful
[3:45] <Azrael-> or b) that trollish racism is not genuine racism
[3:45] <bildramer> which is more problematic?
[3:45] <Beardbeard> I wouldn't really call it trollish racism
[3:45] <Chocolatey_Syrup> The thing about racism on the internet is in a lot of places it was meant to be ironic/self-deprecating, where the joke was "look how stupid I am for actually saying such stupid things as this"
[3:45] <Beardbeard> I'd call it more non-serious or humorous racism
[3:45] <Beardbeard> since it's normally used in jokes
[3:45] <Chocolatey_Syrup> but then it got taken at face value so now a lot of the internet really is just seriously racist in no ironic way
[3:45] <bildramer> >12yos playing MW2
[3:46] <bildramer> I hate kids
[3:46] <bildramer> even though I'm one
[3:46] <Beardbeard> Also using racist jokes in a joking manner in front of the people that they offend, and then being surprised that they are offended, is stupid.
[3:46] <bildramer> in some years I'll comment on my former behaviour and see how stupid I was
[3:46] <bildramer> and so on and so on

[3:46] <Beardbeard> I do that constantly bildramer
[3:46] <bildramer> "<Azrael-> Chocolatey_Syrup: I can easily laugh at racist jokes and such, and find nothing offensive with saying "death to all niggers" etc. etc."
[3:46] <bildramer> selective quoting :3

[3:47] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Like, I'm sure you're not offended, but you don't find anything offensive about it? Really?
[3:47] <Azrael-> Obviously, there are people who would be offended by it.
[3:47] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I don't think it matters if it's serious or not, there's a history to those words, man. It's not just idle talk.
[3:47] <Beardbeard> Saying to kill a group of people in a non serious manner is perfectly okay right guys

[3:51] <Beardbeard> Weaver does not seem like the type to play minecraft
[3:51] <Azrael-> Alpha creative will be so totally awesome.
[3:52] <Chocolatey_Syrup> are you kidding bb
[3:52] <Beardbeard> I haven't met any little black girls in MC yet.
[3:52] <Beardbeard> So no I am not kidding.
[3:52] <Chocolatey_Syrup> well that's because there's no MULTIPLAYER yet

[3:53] <C418> you hope you don't get chosen for multiplayer testing? multiplayer testing consists of "would you please look at me while I walk around like an idiot"

[3:53] <Chocolatey_Syrup> hahahaha

[3:53] <Chocolatey_Syrup> C418 I don't want to get my hopes too high, I know there would be a lot of bugtesting

[3:54] <Beardbeard> apparently I can't run 2 IRCs at once
[3:54] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I like to think I brought survival-mode Minecraft almost singlehandedly to 4chan but looking back it may not have been a wise move
[3:55] <Beardbeard> I think it was a good move
[3:55] <Beardbeard> made it more popular
[3:55] <Beardbeard> gave notch more money to improve it
[3:55] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I also made a bunch of cool pictorials sort of early on, around the time just before paintings were added
[3:56] <Azrael-> bildramer: I'm gonna play malkavian mod now
[3:57] <DDRJake> what do apples do?
[3:57] <DDRJake> and golden apples for that matter
[3:57] <DDRJake> and how does one make a saddle?

[3:57] <Azrael-> I'd assume apples restore health.

[4:19] <Azrael-> I'm a developer on Wiremod, an addon that adds digital logic circuitry to Garry's mod.
[4:19] <Azrael-> I'd probably dig out some simple plans for a CPU and start building.
[4:19] <Conundrumer> my next project, as relaxation, is a 32 (or maybe 64) bit combo lock
[4:19] <Conundrumer> CPU? jesus christ

[4:20] <Azrael-> Yeah, it will be.
[4:20] <Conundrumer> i cant wats for smp
[4:20] <Roadcrosser> UltimateBudgie Hi
[4:20] <C418> remember the dwarf fortress cpu that was a huge roundish complex
[4:21] <Conundrumer> wasn't that a turing machine?
[4:21] <C418> impressive, but in my opinion an extremely impressive waste of time
[4:21] <Conundrumer> the project after the combo lock, i'll make a 5x5 conway's game of life
[4:21] <Conundrumer> minecraft itself is an extremely impressive waste of time, ya know
[4:21] <Azrael-> Conundrumer: I was planning on downloading iCraft or something, and scripting an addon that would allow a flat game world to simulate game of life
[4:22] <Azrael-> so you could just interact with it by replacing black cloth with green
[4:22] <Azrael-> and vice versa
[4:22] <C418> I think theres a difference between playing the game and discarding the game to make a cpu with the logical stuff

[4:23] <Azrael-> the rules state that everybody is playing, but unless you were playing to begin with, the rules of a game don't apply to you
[4:23] <Azrael-> so the only players are those that voluntarily play
[4:24] <Azrael-> Anyway, as I was about to say:

[4:24] <Azrael-> I play peaceful.
[4:24] <Azrael-> It's more peaceful that way :)
[4:24] <Kokopure> those fucking noises!!
[4:25] <Kokopure> GLLLRGL
[4:25] <Azrael-> Kokopure: blame C418
[4:25] <Kokopure> "rattle rattle" mooooooooaaaaaaaan
[4:25] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I love those new noises
[4:25] <Kokopure> AND I LOOK AROUND AND THERE'S NO MONSTERS
[4:25] <Utriax> Blame yourself for playing in caves and on hard mode
[4:25] <Kamiblade> It's better than "sssss....."
[4:25] <Kokopure> SHOW YOURSELF YOU FFFFFF
[4:25] <Kokopure> well Creepers still go SSS, right?
[4:25] <Kamiblade> Last I checked. Been awhile
[4:26] <Kamiblade> I prefer to fight them where I can't hear them XD
[4:26] <Chocolatey_Syrup> oh my god C418 thank you. These make the game so much better I can't even describe. You did a fantastic job. I was down in my mines for the first time since the update and heard cave10.ogg -- that violin pull or whatever it is -- and just spun around, panicking, staring into the deep abyss before fleeing to the surface.
[4:26] <Kamiblade> Nice
[4:26] <Kokopure> rthis
[4:26] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I love the creeping horror of this game and you've given it such a palpable and drippingly good atmosphere
[4:26] <Kokopure> this
[4:26] <Kokopure> is just
[4:26] <Conundrumer> where can i find the audio files again?
[4:26] <Kokopure> the fucking creepiest
[4:26] <Azrael-> In the .jar file, I'd suggest
[4:26] <Kokopure> I am down in my cave lair
[4:26] <Conundrumer> i mean, on minecraft.net
[4:26] <C418> ...I could make it worse
[4:26] <Utriax> :D
[4:26] <Kokopure> and all I fucking hear is gurgles and clanks and terrible sounds
[4:26] <vurtual> So, I'm playing GTA IV
[4:27] <vurtual> Eventually, our server fills up
[4:27] <Kokopure> AND THERE ARE NO MONSTERS
[4:27] <Kamiblade> No no, it's perfect C418
[4:27] <Kokopure> WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME
[4:27] <Kokopure> D:
[4:27] <vurtual> and I am hunting people with a chopper
[4:27] <C418> worse in scarier
[4:27] <Conundrumer> how loud are the ambient cave sounds?
[4:27] <vurtual> Eventually, I target a man called Roxthevox
[4:27] <Kamiblade> New audio modes? "Kind" "Creepy" "Freeky"?
[4:27] <vurtual> or, tl;dr
[4:27] <Chocolatey_Syrup> C418 to be honest I love the creeping horror of this game, and these last few updates have made it more thick and palpable and ominous. If you wanted to make it scarier, I would be fine with it. In fact, at this point I'm sort of looking forward to when we get new monsters, so I can hear all the scary sounds THEY make.
[4:27] <vurtual> I spend the entire day chasing him
[4:27] <vurtual> until I finally persuade enough people to become a polie squad
[4:28] <Utriax> Would be kewl if the music became scarier when you play on hardmode
[4:28] <vurtual> and we swarm him
[4:28] <vurtual> then someone sneaks into the tunnel where he is, and shoots him
[4:28] <Conundrumer> would be better if music changed mood depending on environment/time of day/presence of mobs
[4:28] <Conundrumer> like jak 2
[4:28] <Chocolatey_Syrup> The only thing is that a lot of people assumed your noises, which were billed as "ambient cave sounds", would be like... dripping water, hollow breezes, shifting earth, things like that. I think a lot of people who spoke out about the new cave noises disliked them because they were more like ambient HORROR noises, not what they expected.
[4:28] <Kokopure> it's not that I mind the scary noises ; _ ;
[4:29] <Kokopure> I just don't wanna hear them when I can't see monsters ; _ ;
[4:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> The truth is I'd love to have both, ambient diegetic noises for the caves and ambient non-diegetic noises for the HORROR fun of it, which is so good. But for now I'm happy with just the one. :3
[4:29] <Conundrumer> umm yea, where can i find the audio for the new sounds?
[4:29] <Kamiblade> I would like some more cavey noises, but the horror ones sound like fun :)
[4:29] <Conundrumer> audio files
[4:29] <C418> I refrain from "dripping" noises because they are clich?
[4:29] <C418> and make people get confused with water
[4:29] <Kamiblade> Good point
[4:30] <DimJim> My friend said he heard one that sounded like the Charger from L4D2

[4:30] <Utriax> lol
[4:30] <DimJim> It's already bad enough that spider noises make me make a sad noise
[4:30] <Kamiblade> Raging zombies would be cool. I want Raging zombie mode :P
[4:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Still, you know what I mean, though, right? Your noises are mostly non-diegetic, it seems, very much like a classy horror-movie score. Not so much the natural sounds of being in a cave. Some could be, arguably, like the distant breathing of some great beast, but some are obviously just horror sounds. Don't get me wrong, that's great, but the way it was presented made some people expect something else.
[4:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> To be honest I probably couldn't even come up with good ambient cave noises, it seems to me like they'd be mostly silent.
[4:31] <Kamiblade> Is there echo in caves? I've never noticed.
[4:31] <FNugget> echos and water drops. thats ambient cave sounds
[4:32] * C418 (C418@p5B3D52B3.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[4:32] <Kamiblade> I mean like echos of people/critters walking
[4:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> aw dang he left
[4:32] <DimJim> if you're in a cave with enough undead mobs you can hear tormented souls
[4:32] <vurtual> caves are B-movies, Chocolatey_Syrup
[4:32] <Kamiblade> Like if I step in a cave, it echos more than if I step in outside
[4:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I think once we get / if we get ambient noises for the overworld, then we could just leave the ambient cave noises as they are, and the cave ambiance would be distinct because it was so silent, whereas above ground, you could hear breezes, birds, bugs, that sort of thing.
[4:33] <Kamiblade> Not a bad idea
[4:33] <Mojo-Rizan> So how about....
[4:33] <Kamiblade> no
[4:33] <Mojo-Rizan> Ambient noise from dropped items?
[4:33] <Kamiblade> :D
[4:33] <DimJim> I'd love to hear ruins noises.
[4:33] <Mojo-Rizan> Like a Wom Wom Wom
[4:33] <Chocolatey_Syrup> that's not ruins
[4:34] <Kamiblade> Like when dropped items bounce off the ground or something?
[4:34] <Chocolatey_Syrup> you're thinking of clothes dryers
[4:34] <Azrael-> Chocolatey_Syrup: I've been caving irl before, it's really rather noisy
[4:34] <DimJim> Ruins would be like
[4:34] <Azrael-> also, lol'd
[4:34] <DimJim> Moans
[4:34] <Azrael-> that's not ruins
[4:34] <Azrael-> you're thinking of orgies
[4:34] <DimJim> Maybe every once in a while someone crying and then stopping abruptly
[4:34] <Chocolatey_Syrup> okay well then enlighten me Azrael
[4:34] <Vic> don't
[4:34] <Chocolatey_Syrup> what kind of noises do you get down there?
[4:34] <Vic> even give him ideas
[4:35] <FNugget> noises are so loud. so many zombies in my face, but they're not
[4:35] <DimJim> In deep ruins you can sometimes hear screams
[4:36] <DimJim> And one of the noises is a clip from a Justin Bieber song
[4:36] <DimJim> Wait no that's too scary

[5:40] <Cial> i was gonna say that T_T
[5:40] <Malikat> and throw it at a creeper
[5:41] <Malikat> and be like "yo nig hold my ice"
[5:41] <Epsilon1> lol it's already updated :P
[5:41] <CyborgDragon> mooo
[5:41] <CyborgDragon> well, my mom is fine

[5:41] <slowriot> course - he updates as soon as there are any changes
[5:41] <CyborgDragon> no burns showing up
[5:41] <SireTRM> So, has anyone you people have heard of built a mac-native compatible Alpha editor of any type?
[5:42] <Epsilon1> hey in the .jar i saw something like a ... pouch for the arrows...
[5:42] <CyborgDragon> hey, what's that site where you just paste in it, and it saves the screenshot?
[5:42] <SireTRM> Yea, the quiver has been around for a while.
[5:42] <CyborgDragon> epsilon, the quiver, it's old
[5:42] <Epsilon1> hmm...
[5:42] <CyborgDragon> any ideas of what that site is?
[5:42] <Epsilon1> never saw it in game :P
[5:43] <SireTRM> Epsilon1, it hasn't been implemented.
[5:43] <Epsilon1> lol
[5:43] <CyborgDragon> anyone?
[5:43] <Epsilon1> photobucket?
[5:43] <Malikat> tinypic?
[5:43] <CyborgDragon> no its not photobucket
[5:43] <SireTRM> I personally use imageshack. . . But I'm not sure what the screenshot paste site is.
[5:43] <CyborgDragon> you cant just paste into it
[5:44] <CyborgDragon> i dont feel like opening up paint/gimp/whatever to paste and save the image
[5:44] <CyborgDragon> there's a site where you just paste, and it uploads what you pasted

[5:45] <Epsilon1> hmm anyone know any good irc programs?
[5:45] <Malikat> not trillian
[5:45] <CyborgDragon> chatzilla and mIRC, hydraIRC, xchat
[5:45] <chariot> mirc
[5:46] <Epsilon1> mirc stinks
[5:46] <CyborgDragon> but mIRC is pay for, so i suggest one of the other 3
[5:46] <Cial> Chatzilla , mIRC, xchat, and trillian, pidgen
[5:46] <chariot> no it doesnt
[5:46] <CyborgDragon> TRILLIAN AND PIDGEN ARE NOT GOOD
[5:46] <Epsilon1> ill try chatzilla
[5:46] <SireTRM> Chatzilla via xulrunner.
[5:46] <CyborgDragon> atleast, not for irc clients
[5:46] <Cial> CyborgDragon, they work
[5:46] <SireTRM> Chatzilla isn't very good as a FF addon if you do stuff like play minecraft
[5:46] <SireTRM> FF should be restarted frequently. . .
[5:46] <CyborgDragon> chatzilla is a firefox runner, but as siretrm said, you can use it through XULrunner
[5:46] <CyborgDragon> sireTRM, it's called client
[5:46] <SireTRM> Wayyyy ninja'd.
[5:47] <CyborgDragon> firefox addon*
[5:47] <Epsilon1> so what should i get?
[5:47] <CyborgDragon> you never specified it was a firefox addon sireTRM

[5:47] <SireTRM> I said Chatzilla via xulrunner. . .
[5:47] <Cial> *prefer
[5:47] <SireTRM> Then I said it as a FF addon.
[5:47] <Epsilon1> lol anything offline :P
[5:47] <SireTRM> Then you said something.
[5:47] <Epsilon1> i have FF
[5:48] <vurtual> IRC, spellcheck?
[5:48] <vurtual> umad, bro?
[5:48] <SireTRM> Nope, I use my chatzilla spell checker often.
[5:48] <TheMilkMan> FFFFF- I just went to see the last airbender
[5:48] <vurtual> u mad.
[5:48] <vurtual> TheMilkMan
[5:48] <SireTRM> I am insane.
[5:48] <TheMilkMan> Huge dissapointment.....
[5:48] <vurtual> it's like being raped down there
[5:48] <vurtual> through your eyes
[5:48] <TheMilkMan> Wasn't even 3d
[5:48] <TheMilkMan> it was 2d the whole time
[5:48] <SireTRM> Yea, I've heard of its failure.
[5:48] <TheMilkMan> except the credits...
[5:48] <Epsilon1> lol i know
[5:48] <CyborgDragon> seriously, i knew it would be a huge disappointment ever since i saw the first commercial
[5:48] <vurtual> Time for another round of STEAM DOWNLOADING THINGS
[5:48] <TheMilkMan> Basicly they tried to condense the entire chapter into 90 mins
[5:49] <vurtual> lite edition
[5:49] <TheMilkMan> Yea I saw the commercial and was like that looks like crap...
[5:49] <TheMilkMan> but i had to see it anyways
[5:49] <SireTRM> Original animated series => live action ==> epic failure.
[5:49] <vurtual> What, Vurtual? Not gonna chug down Red Faction Geurilla yet?
[5:49] <vurtual> TOO MUCH FUN AT ONCE?
[5:49] <CyborgDragon> they should've condensed it into 150 minutes(2 and a half hours)
[5:49] <vurtual> It's true.
[5:49] <vurtual> I've actually had so much fun recently.
[5:49] <vurtual> That I'm not in the mood to have more fun.
[5:49] <TheMilkMan> True CyborgDragon that would have made it alot better.
[5:49] <vurtual> I just want to go to bed now!
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> vurtual, red faction guerilla, reconstructor mod
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> fun city
[5:50] <SireTRM> Still, three or four seasons of half hour episodes. . .
[5:50] <TheMilkMan> And the acting was pretty bad too imo...
[5:50] <vurtual> I want to make a black hole gun in some open roamy physicsy game
[5:50] <SireTRM> That's no small story.
[5:50] <vurtual> that fires a laser, causing a swirling vortex that throws objects around, with variable intensity
[5:50] <Epsilon1> i finnaly crashed 7 mac's in one day!
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> i thought the movie was only the first chapter
[5:50] <vurtual> so I can suck cars off the street
[5:50] <SireTRM> How, Epsilon1?
[5:50] <TheMilkMan> SireTRM, it was only 1 season in the movie luckily xD
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> as in, the first season(because each chapter is a season)
[5:50] <TheMilkMan> It is CyborgDragon
[5:51] <TheMilkMan> If it was the whole god damned series then that would have been ...
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> still, the end of the animated series was badass
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> energy bending, bitch
[5:51] <SireTRM> Oh, well that's *somewhat* better. . .
[5:51] <Epsilon1> well there all from like the 1980's :P
[5:51] <SireTRM> Oh.
[5:51] <SireTRM> We had some of those.
[5:51] <SireTRM> Ah, the SE/30 days.

[5:52] <SireTRM> My current computer just died when I restarted it because the logic board died.

[5:54] <TheMilkMan> My laptop is alienware, should have gotten a different brand, more for the moeny, but oh well...
[5:54] <SireTRM> Though, my model computer had a higher potential for graphics card failures.
[5:54] <Epsilon1> it looks like ur RAM flucked up
[5:54] <SireTRM> That sounds like the motherboard, not video.
[5:54] <Epsilon1> ...
[5:54] <TheMilkMan> ah
[5:55] <SireTRM> If it's just the video card, everything else should start working
[5:55] <SireTRM> Ok, shower
[5:55] * SireTRM afk
[5:55] <Epsilon1> i think it's the ROM Thats pre-programmed in the comp
[5:55] <TheMilkMan> Well I was going to unplug the video card to see if it would work without it and if it did then... but i unplugged it and turned it on again and it made really loud BEEEEEEEEEEPPPPP so i was like OW FFFF--- and turned it off

[7:31] <CyborgDragon> who thinks that would just be epic?
[7:31] <FNugget> is C418 or whatever working on new sounds for tools? because my punching sounds like a pickaxe
[7:31] <Shrub> It would
[7:32] <CyborgDragon> or even better, an old pong arcade machine, since it's simpler and most definitely easier to make
[7:32] <Shrub> I think the sounds for pickaxing should be really loud and hearable from a distance
[7:32] <Dman757> So far the max delay repeater device I was able to make was 20 seconds
[7:32] <Epsilon1> pong on atari 2600 :P

[8:49] <Mojo-Rizan> Hello.
[8:49] <Scrippy> That would make sense, Cial.
[8:49] <Scrippy> Hammering a rail into ice just sounds like a terible idea.

[8:50] <Scrippy> But it does make it easier to make cross-water minecart paths.
[8:50] <Scrippy> Yeah, but 18 wheeler does not equal train
[8:50] <Scrippy> Also heyo Mojo.
[8:50] <Mojo-Rizan> minecart doesnt eiuthjer
[8:50] <Mojo-Rizan> either*
[8:50] <Scrippy> The general idea of laying down rails is the same.
[8:51] <Cial> thank you mojo XD
[8:51] <Mojo-Rizan> but it doesn't take a train to put down rails.
[8:51] <Scrippy> Ffff your logical fallacies
[8:51] <Scrippy> look
[8:51] <Scrippy> If you've ever seen somebody lay rail before
[8:51] <Mojo-Rizan> But wouldn't an 18 wheeler put more pressure on the ice than a hammer and some rails?
[8:51] * Bomb_Spammer|shower is now known as Bomb_Spammer
[8:51] <Scrippy> You anchor them by driving a spike into the ground.
[8:51] <Cial> yes
[8:51] <Scrippy> Not really.
[8:52] <Scrippy> The anchor can break apart the ice.
[8:52] <Mojo-Rizan> Well there's our fallacy
[8:52] <Cial> depends on how thick the ice is really
[8:52] <Scrippy> Like, think of it like this
[8:52] * Midvalley^gerber (bu@rrcs-71-42-132-192.sw.biz.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[8:52] <Scrippy> You have a piece of tissue paper streched across a bowl
[8:52] <Scrippy> You can in theory put a ball on it
[8:52] <Scrippy> And it'll stay there without breaking
[8:53] <Mojo-Rizan> Well I think of it this way: You are able to carry 64 sets of train tracks in your pockets. I don't think ice should obey laws that I don't.
[8:53] <Scrippy> But if you pierce the tissue paper with a needle, the ball has a much higher chance of ripping the rest of the paper.
[8:53] <Scrippy> Minecraft is a balance between real an not real, and it makes sense that minetracks would not be placeable on ice.
[8:53] <Mojo-Rizan> I can agree.

[8:56] <Mojo-Rizan> Did you know, that ice truckers often anchor in their trucks while resting.
[8:56] <Mojo-Rizan> much like one would anchor in a train rail.

[9:26] <LordA> Lol
[9:26] <TheMilkMan> I think the irl dev should add a mute feature...
[9:26] <LordA> It just occured to me that Notch added winter

[9:27] <TheMilkMan> i know right
[9:27] <TheMilkMan> That's what i first though of
[9:27] <TheMilkMan> I was like wiat whyst here snow now?
[9:27] <Risugami> hmm Dwarf Fortress seems complex enough for my liking
[9:27] <LordA> Snow should stop after a few days
[9:27] <LordA> and only be in certaint parts of the map
[9:27] <LordA> and on tall mountains
[9:28] <LordA> Anyhow, off to play infdev and this might lag it

[9:31] <Scrippy> Or that's what I would be doing

[9:32] <Azathoth> lol "ASCII based games"
[9:32] <Scrippy> Goddamnit they don't even guilld houses.
[9:32] <Scrippy> Argh.
[9:32] <Risugami> basically, not originally made with tiles :P
[9:32] <Scrippy> Must re-embark on a human city.
[9:32] <LordA> argh
[9:32] <LordA> this snow is giving me 1-4 FPS
[9:33] <Scrippy> D=
[9:33] <Cial> it did me like that
[9:33] <Scrippy> Minecraft makes my laptop overheat on a regular basis.
[9:33] <Cial> but today i get rather good fps
[9:33] <Scrippy> Snow doubly so.
[9:33] <mnjiman> Im going to test to see if i can get a cart
[9:33] <Azathoth> i'll do you like that
[9:33] <mnjiman> to drop down
[9:33] <mnjiman> and continue on
[9:33] <Scrippy> Is he doing more optomization?
[9:33] <Risugami> ha. still remember my first game I played that used ASCII characters
[9:33] <LordA> My render is on tiny too
[9:33] <Risugami> Dracula, on DOS
[9:35] <Cial> :/ where do the files for the client hide?
[9:35] <Cial> on vista
[9:35] <Risugami> where does %appdata% go?

[9:46] <LordA> From the 80's and 90s
[9:47] <Azathoth> oldest thing i've got now is a gamecube :|
[9:47] <Azathoth> oh wait. i've got one of the big old gray gameboys
[9:47] <Tukiko> I went into the basement of a house I'm moving into and they had an Atari 5400 and a C64.
[9:47] <mnjiman> i played those
[9:47] <Tukiko> Azathoth: Mine has a screen that won't stay on and my Pokemon Yellow edition GBC has broken speakers. :(
[9:47] <mnjiman> good times..
[9:47] <Azathoth> :(
[9:48] <Azathoth> actually i think i have two of the original gameboys for some reason
[9:48] <Tukiko> My GBA has a big scratch across the screen as well.
[9:48] <Olivil> I add backlight to old first generation gameboys
[9:48] <DEElekgolo> yo
[9:48] <Tukiko> Also does Gamestop still sell used GBA SPs? I want to get one to play my GB and GBC games with a backlight.
[9:48] <Risugami> I destroyed one of my GBAs
[9:48] <Risugami> Metroid Fusion was a bitch
[9:48] <Olivil> i dont think they carry GBA stuff anymore, if so its hella cheap
[9:49] <Tukiko> I love Metroid Fusion
[9:49] <Azathoth> you think there's a big market for working 20 year old gameboys?
[9:49] <Tukiko> The only Metroid game that I thought was fun enough to finish.
[9:49] <Tukiko> Azathoth: Ebay
[9:49] <Risugami> Super Metroid is fun too
[9:49] <Olivil> Azathoth: if you love DIY stuff, look into this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnaTBrq_EBE
[9:50] <Olivil> its great i saw one in person, it was atomic purple (transparent) and you could see the backlight thru it was great
[9:50] <Tukiko> Oh, I was so pissed.
[9:50] <Azathoth> why would you get an SP just to put the backlight into an older system? :O
[9:50] <mnjiman> it works?
[9:50] <Olivil> well, if it's just to play GBC/GB game, i prefer the feel of the original
[9:50] <Olivil> totally
[9:50] <Tukiko> I made an NES controller compatible with a PC through a serial port... Turns out my computer doesn't have a serial port and I was thinking of my mobo from 2 iterations before. DX

[11:59] <DEElekgolo> can someone quickly upload a index.dat they have
[11:59] <HyperionCZ> i remembered you built cool stuff and u were good at spawn worlds
[11:59] <DEElekgolo> im making a class in python
[11:59] <Vis{IDK}> You think that duct tape could fix a chair?
[11:59] <Superwafflez> yes
[11:59] <Superwafflez> Poorly
[11:59] <wry> i've done it
[11:59] <wry> and it worked well for me

[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> Well, mine squeaks.
[12:00] <Pharod42> Is it just linked to artificial light levels?
[12:00] <Hyperion> guys i wanna see
[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> The bolts holding the part you sit on to the leg underneath it are gone
[12:00] <Hyperion> how infdev would look at fall
[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> i.e ]|--wheels
[12:00] <Hyperion> i think he is going to test it soon
[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> So part A ]
[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> is wher eyou sit
[12:00] <Hyperion> such as winter as we can see at alhpa
[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> part B is the mount
[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> part C --- is the leg
[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> and then the wheels are below that
[12:00] <Scrippy> I think he's going to get multi up next.
[12:00] <wry> Pharod42, that would make sense
[12:00] <Vis{IDK}> I want to attach part A to bart B
[12:01] <Vis{IDK}> without ruining the sitty part
[12:01] <wry> since light is amplified when behind glass
[12:01] <Scrippy> Weekday updates are mostly bugfixes and under-the-hood stuff.
[12:01] <Scrippy> Weekends he adds neat things.
[12:01] <wry> and under the pants stuff

[12:15] <JabJabJab> made random quack noises too
[12:15] <Rooster> I want to figure out how to use those.
[12:15] <dys|sleep> Question is
[12:15] <Rooster> The possibilites are endless
[12:15] <dys|sleep> how does he know how to use it
[12:16] <dys|sleep> apparently he is now imitating a girl
[12:16] <dys|sleep> According to members in his clan thread :L
[12:16] <Rooster> Hell, if from what you say is true. A child can use it.
[12:16] <dys|sleep> I want to make a burden of evidence argument upon him
[12:16] <Rooster> I've got an idea for a sitcom/internet gag.
[12:16] <Rooster> Get a famous person like Jack Black, and have him play TF2 with a mic.
[12:16] <Black_Nerran> Like it so far
[12:17] <Rooster> :D
[12:17] <dys|sleep> ok im going to bed

[13:12] <Tukiko> wry, let me open this question for you as wel.
[13:12] <Tukiko> You know when you pause or open the main menu of a game the menu takes up the whole screen and is different from, say, a drop down menu? What would the general term for that menu be called? I don't like Menu and MainMenu or PauseMenu don't always fit.
[13:12] <Shrub> Splash Menu?
[13:12] <Tukiko> well*
[13:12] <Tukiko> Oh hey, that sounds good.
[13:12] <Tukiko> Thanks. :D
[13:12] <Shrub> Screen Menu?
[13:12] <LG_Legacy> Wat
[13:12] <Tukiko> lol
[13:13] <TheMilkMan> I think splash screens are more for when you run a game and it makse you watch 20 flippin minutes of wow look at us we're awesome previews...
[13:13] <wry> Tukiko, i would call it 'menu'
[13:13] <Tukiko> Yeah, but it's better than what I came up with.
[13:13] <wry> but i'm not a programmer, nor do i really care
[13:13] <Tukiko> Sounds too generic. There are multiple types of menus.

[14:10] <Zek99> Tukiko: in mine craft?

[14:15] <Tukiko> I remember when Combat Arms first came out
[14:15] <Tukiko> Was a piece of crap
[14:15] <Tukiko> Is it still?
[14:15] <Zek99> still is
[14:15] <Shrub> Still is
[14:15] <Tukiko> Alrighty then

[14:15] <Vis{IDK}> Well, content wise not so much
[14:15] <Vis{IDK}> but player-wise, yes
[14:15] <Zek99> both wise
[14:15] <Vis{IDK}> Nosir
[14:15] <Shrub> but actual game-wise
[14:15] <Vis{IDK}> It could be a GOOD game
[14:15] <Vis{IDK}> if 1/2 the players weren't hackers
[14:15] <Vis{IDK}> and the other 1/2 weren't noobs
[14:15] <Shrub> then there'd be no players
[14:16] <Vis{IDK}> :)
[14:16] <Zek99> It cant be a good game
[14:16] <Shrub> also, you just implied you were a hacker. gtfo
[14:16] <Vis{IDK}> Hrm
[14:16] <Vis{IDK}> It seems as if I did
[14:16] <visiON> derp
[14:16] <Vis{IDK}> Oh well.
[14:16] <Zek99> How about soldier front
[14:16] <Vis{IDK}> Anyways, BACK TO THE POINT, YEEAAAHHHHHH
[14:16] <Tukiko> Or a noob.
[14:16] <Vis{IDK}> My "guns with highest kills" page is fucking funny
[14:16] <Shrub> Hammer in Minecraft: Discuss.
[14:17] <Zek99> Stop
[14:17] <Zek99> hamertime
[14:17] <Tukiko> Shrub: As a tool or a weapon?
[14:17] <Shrub> D:
[14:17] <Shrub> Both, possibly.
[14:17] <Zek99> :D
[14:17] <Shrub> mianly a tool
[14:17] <Vis{IDK}> I had the AUG A3 for 90 days
[14:17] <Vis{IDK}> 3k kills
[14:17] <Zek99> :(
[14:17] <Vis{IDK}> I have the G36 permanently
[14:17] <Zek99> I feel sorry for you Vis
[14:17] <Vis{IDK}> 1k kills
[14:17] <Zek99> that you have to kill people to unlock guns
[14:17] <TheMilkMan> Wow it's weird how this chat is so active now, while just about an hour ago it was dead...
[14:17] <Zek99> in CSS you just by them
[14:17] <Vis{IDK}> ...You don't have to UNLOCK guns
[14:17] <Shrub> It's not weird
[14:18] <Vis{IDK}> This is the kills I get WITH the guns
[14:18] <TheMilkMan> What are we talking about guys?
[14:18] <Zek99> Hammer would be cool in minecraft
[14:18] <TheMilkMan> tf2 and css
[14:18] <TheMilkMan> ?
[14:18] <Vis{IDK}> Combat Arms
[14:18] <Vis{IDK}> Anyways
[14:18] <TheMilkMan> Oh bahhh
[14:18] <Vis{IDK}> the next gun in line
[14:18] <Vis{IDK}> is my "ninjato"
[14:18] <Vis{IDK}> (It's a tanto)
[14:18] <Zek99> no
[14:18] <Vis{IDK}> with 900 kills.
[14:18] <Zek99> tanto isnt a Ninjato
[14:18] <Tukiko> Only if it has a special use.. Which I can't see how since we don't need a hammer and anvil to make weapons and tools
[14:18] <Vis{IDK}> That, to me, is funny.
[14:18] <vede> Interesting how this channel has reached the point where it can be active nearly 24/7.

[14:19] <Vis{IDK}> and it's number three on my list
[14:19] <vede> So few people to talk to.
[14:20] <Vis{IDK}> Ten days ago, I got the M960
[14:20] <Vis{IDK}> and it's fourth
[14:20] <Vis{IDK}> o.o
[14:20] <TheMilkMan> Ye too bad it's 3 am right now xD

[14:21] <Fiskie> Wake up in the morning feeling like GETTING BANNED
[14:21] <Tukiko> No because it's last week for me.
[14:21] <vede> O_O
[14:21] <Zek99> Hammers should destroy blocks
[14:22] <Fiskie> Aren't there enough tools for that already
[14:22] <Tukiko> Zek: We have 4 different ways to destroy blocks already if you don't count fists
[14:22] <Vis{IDK}> oh, how I long for an AUG A3 SE perm :(
[14:22] <Zek99> So you can utterly destroy blocks?
[14:22] <Shrub> Obsidian
[14:22] <Tukiko> Zek99: ^^^
[14:22] <Vis{IDK}> Yes
[14:23] <Shrub> and glass
[14:23] * Vis{IDK} shoots blocks with his AUG A3 perm
[14:23] <Zek99> fail
[14:23] * Vis{IDK} destroyed blocks
[14:23] <Zek99> I should read the wiki shouldnt I
[14:23] <Tukiko> Punch glass for 1 second and it breaks permanently, use a diamond pick for obsidian
[14:23] <Fiskie> Notch should add rocket launchers
[14:23] <Fiskie> More fun.

[14:40] <Tukiko> <LG_Legacy> Caps itself is disallowed <LG_Legacy> Off topic discussion is still allowed and there should be no reason to flip out otherwise.
[14:40] <Tukiko> bildramer: ^^
[14:40] <visiON> Okay
[14:40] <Shrub> also
[14:40] <Shrub> <Shrub> I like to finger my penis
[14:40] <bildramer> :D
[14:40] <Azathoth> :O
[14:40] <LG_Legacy> Alright enough.
[14:40] <bildramer> point proved.
[14:40] <Azathoth> proof pointed
[14:40] <LG_Legacy> Also bildramer
[14:41] <bildramer> in some minutes some relatives are coming
[14:41] <Shrub> bildramer likes to pinger his fenis
[14:41] <LG_Legacy> It's called Ping
[14:41] <vede> But bildramer, I totally agree with your proposal.
[14:41] <bildramer> brb showing off Minecraft
[14:41] <Shrub> kick their asses bild
[14:41] <Shrub> With a VENGEANCE.
[14:41] <TheMilkMan> So I was ninja'd pretty hard right there, eh guys?
[14:41] <vede> People who are like "Okay talk about Minecraft now!" need to get punched in the mouth.
[14:41] <bildramer> :D
[14:41] <Shrub> Okay talk about Minecraft now!
[14:41] <bildramer> now what did I want to do...
[14:41] <visiON> You want me to get punched in the mouth?
[14:41] <LG_Legacy> Please ping an op or query them if you have a problem.
[14:41] <Tukiko> So LG_Legacy, basically we're allowed to pretty much talk about whatever we want but I guess if someone wants to talk about minecraft, for whatever reason I can't think of *psht*, we should shift the discussion to that?
[14:41] <visiON> you evil
[14:41] * Cue (cueball61@cpc2-alde4-2-0-cust462.6-2.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[14:41] <visiON> evil little man
[14:41] <C418> man LG_Legacy
[14:42] <C418> I would have kickbanned milkman for that

[14:42] <TheMilkMan> What'd I do c418?
[14:42] <Shrub> rape them both vis
[14:42] <bildramer> *there?
[14:42] <C418> lets say
[14:42] <TheMilkMan> C418, what'd I do?
[14:42] <C418> have a choice of words that is a bit flawed
[14:42] <vede> We should only shift over to Minecraft discussion in a natural, organic way.
[14:42] <Shrub> you're going to wax the kick button?
[14:42] <vede> None of this "Okay that discussion's over. Minecraft now." crap.
[14:42] <Shrub> Oh oh OH YES! Minecraft YES!
[14:42] <visiON> I like green blocks
[14:42] <Tukiko> With all natural herbs and spices, vede?
[14:42] <bildramer> ...why is my sound muted
[14:42] <visiON> Red blocks just aint my type
[14:43] <TheMilkMan> Nosrsly what did I do? C418 ???
[14:43] <bildramer> dammit, tripped over cable
[14:43] <vede> Tukiko, no animal testing either!
[14:43] * Shrub is a Shrub Block because he's cool
[14:43] <Azathoth> i think what C418 is saying...
[14:43] <TheMilkMan> LG_Legacy, what did i do?
[14:43] <Azathoth> is that you're a douchebag
[14:43] <LG_Legacy> Ask C4
[14:43] <C418> <TheMilkMan> Shrub you should use some wax then stick it in ur penis hole then masturbate with it in there...
[14:43] <bildramer> ...
[14:43] <LG_Legacy> Ah
[14:43] <Shrub> ahahahahaHAHAHA
[14:43] <C418> that is worth a kickban for two years
[14:43] <LG_Legacy> That
[14:43] <C418> actually
[14:43] <TheMilkMan> Oh well did you see what he had said to make me say that in return?
[14:43] <visiON> I was just talking bout anal masturbation..
[14:43] <Shrub> :<
[14:43] <LG_Legacy> C4 Just let it slip.
[14:44] <bildramer> well, why the hell are we talking about that
[14:44] <Vis{IDK}> File Handling is changing files, right?
[14:44] <visiON> why the hell not

[14:44] <Tukiko> Aww bildramer, that looks like a cute happy face
[14:44] <Shrub> Ah.
[14:44] <Azathoth> every time you call him C4, i just think "A BOMB?!?!"
[14:44] <Vis{IDK}> "If you get kicked, you clearly shouldn't come back."
[14:44] <TheMilkMan> <Shrub> I like to finger my penis" So I replied with that, C418 ....
[14:45] <Shrub> Az: Same
[14:45] <cello> i want heavy boots (iron and diamond) to make you able to goomba stomp enemies
[14:45] <visiON> What's wrong with such discussion
[14:45] <bildramer> why not come back
[14:45] <cello> not instant-kill, just do a bit of damage
[14:45] <LG_Legacy> Milkman i think thats quite enough
[14:45] <vede> There have been some pretty eye-gougingly frank sexual discussions in here lately.
[14:45] <bildramer> I thought it means "you did something wrong, fix your behaviour"
[14:45] <Shrub> guys I like to plow dead people.
[14:45] <Shrub> There I said it.
[14:45] <Vis{IDK}> bildramer: Describe file handling for me? I mean, would changing a file's location be considered file handling?
[14:45] <TheMilkMan> LG_Legacy, Well Taken out of context it makes me look completely wrong but it's not like everyone else wasn't on the same topic.
[14:45] <visiON> We're much a like
[14:45] <Tukiko> Guys, just drop it all. :|
[14:45] <Shrub> Yeah

[15:34] <TotempaaltJ> What do you mean?
[15:34] <Azathoth> so it seems like it would get confusing what type everything is
[15:34] <Azathoth> also weird stuff happens. and... fuck i don't even know
[15:34] <TotempaaltJ> Ah. That...
[15:34] <cello> umop-apisdn!
[15:34] <Tukiko> That's one thing I hate about PHP.
[15:34] <Azathoth> also i hate that __def__ bullshit or whatever those keywords are
[15:34] <TotempaaltJ> I find defining variables quite useless.
[15:34] <TotempaaltJ> __init__, maybe?
[15:34] <Azathoth> they're the most horrible keywords ever
[15:34] <Azathoth> yes
[15:34] <Azathoth> double underscores???!
[15:34] <TotempaaltJ> I like em.
[15:35] <TotempaaltJ> Yeah.
[15:35] <TotempaaltJ> PHP sucks for the sole reason that it's typeless.
[15:35] <Azathoth> i just don't like it
[15:35] <TotempaaltJ> Ah, well, it's a matter of taste, I guess.
[15:35] <TotempaaltJ> I lloooove it :3

[16:46] <bildramer> go there, quit game
[16:46] <Vic> i'd replace one line of wood with cloth though
[16:46] <bildramer> else you get randomly looted and/or killed
[16:46] <chef> but you need a third option to mining or sitting on ur butt during night time
[16:47] <Tukiko> bildramer: Like WoW's resting exp where if you log out in a town you can get 200% exp for a bit after you log in?
[16:47] <chef> the crafting isnt important

[16:47] <Vic> the idea is ok.
[16:47] <Tukiko> chef: You should be mining at night. :P
[16:47] <Tukiko> bildramer: That's why I explained it.
[16:47] <chef> yeah but you get sick of that
[16:48] <chef> and after a while, your mine is so big, it takes a long time to get back to the surface
[16:48] <Tukiko> chef: The entire game is about mining and building with the stuff you mine.
[16:48] <chef> so you jsut end up minign all the time instead of going out during the day at all

[18:14] <Beardbeard> I just don't like the 15 bucks per month mmos
[18:14] <Ominus> i like rp servers with many ppl
[18:14] <Beardbeard> You're rebuying the game every month
[18:14] <Deet> i don't play it
[18:14] <Beardbeard> it's silly
[18:14] <Deet> i've paid for about 4 months of gameplay
[18:14] <Whiskerz> Personally I dont see the point of MMOs
[18:14] <Deet> got to 80, raided a biy
[18:14] <Whiskerz> but yeah
[18:14] <Whiskerz> thats jsut me
[18:14] <Deet> then got bored
[18:15] <Beardbeard> MMOs can be fun if the community and gameplay are good
[18:15] <Beardbeard> Or if you play with good friends
[18:15] <Whiskerz> I dont really see the aim tho
[18:15] <Whiskerz> then again, i play MC
[18:15] <Deet> there's no goal in wow
[18:15] <Deet> but there are goals

[18:15] <muddtusk> any of you tried trhe MedianXL mod of D2?
[18:15] <Beardbeard> The goal in WoW is to get a 6k gearscore and be an elitist prick in trade chat.
[18:15] <LG_Legacy> Yep
[18:15] <LG_Legacy> Sucks ass
[18:16] <muddtusk> Why didn't you like it?
[18:16] <Beardbeard> At least, that's what I've seen from playing it.
[18:16] <LG_Legacy> Too advanced
[18:16] <muddtusk> Too advanced?
[18:16] <LG_Legacy> Doesn't feel like Diablo II
[18:16] <muddtusk> It is a pretty heavy mod

[18:37] <Naxza> But I just hate how SC2 was promised to be out THREE OR MORE YEARS AGO. And guess how many WoW expansions we got in that time?
[18:37] <Beardbeard> It was Activision's idea to make you buy multiple versions of starcraft 2 if you want to play with people in other countries.
[18:37] <Beardbeard> And for that I hate them
[18:37] <Whiskerz> bildramer: i just saw that one, shame its not funny eh

[18:58] <leiche> Look at valve bildramer :P

[19:25] <Beardbeard> Might as well be.
[19:25] <Jaska-> nope
[19:25] <Beardbeard> furries want to stick their dicks in animals.
[19:25] <Jaska-> beastility between human and animal
[19:26] <vurtual> zoophilia is entirely different from a furry fetish
[19:26] <Jaska-> furry between humans
[19:26] <Jaska-> with silly costumes
[19:26] <Jaska-> :D
[19:26] <vurtual> on one side of the whole furry thing, you have people who go like "Hey, I can draw anthropomorphic people!"
[19:26] <Beardbeard> furry is making humans look like animals to make them feel less bad about the fact that they want to fuck cats.
[19:26] <vurtual> On the other end, you have the types who think they have an inner animal
[19:26] <Jaska-> duuude..
[19:26] <vurtual> and then cosplay around pretending to be that animal
[19:26] <Jaska-> you're so wrong again beardbeard

[20:35] <gdude2002> cryengine
[20:35] <gdude2002> that'd be epic
[20:35] <SireTRM> Lutin, locking an item value will cause it to remain infinite mostly.
[20:35] <Logon> have more items then can be shown poof seems inf
[20:35] <Miclee> If I could get Minecraft working in DX9
[20:35] <gdude2002> but it ain't happening :P
[20:35] <Miclee> I could put HDR onto it
[20:35] <DEElekgolo> lol wat
[20:35] <Lutin> I think it's cause I overflowed it :S
[20:35] <bildramer> if you get -1 items it's infinite
[20:35] <gdude2002> lol
[20:35] <DEElekgolo> minecraft uses opengl
[20:35] <Miclee> But it refuses to run in DX9
[20:35] <Miclee> I got it to DX8 at most
[20:35] <sana> why the hell would you want that.
[20:36] <Lutin> Cause it uses a signed 4-bit value
[20:36] <sana> it'd positively look like shit.
[20:36] <gdude2002> I've got DX11 but it doesn't use DX anyway
[20:36] <Lutin> And I made it FF FF FF FF

[20:36] <Miclee> No

[20:36] <bildramer> then back to signed int
[20:36] <gdude2002> ohk
[20:36] <bildramer> 0xFFFFFFFF
[20:36] <Miclee> Basically, better lighting.
[20:36] <DEElekgolo> yea

[20:37] <ClassiestMedic> niiice
[20:37] <Lutin> Typically 16-bit instead of 8-bit
[20:37] <DEElekgolo> depending on the exposure

[20:38] <Lutin> 16-bit being an HDR image

[20:41] <Logon> all th etime

[21:25] <Quatroking> I've been moderating the wiki using my fucking Ninty DS last week because I barely had computer access
[21:25] <gdude2002> http://www.youtube.com/v/xt0V0_1MS0Q if you can't see it
[21:25] <Kizzycocoa> finally. the madness is over.
[21:25] <Kizzycocoa> you need more moderators :P
[21:25] <gdude2002> :P
[21:25] <Kizzycocoa> that, or just a bit of protection
[21:25] <gdude2002> It's never enough
[21:25] <Quatroking> and when I did had access to a computer (with internet) i had to cope with shitloads of red ore crap
[21:25] <visiON> i can ride my bike with no handlebars
[21:25] <Quatroking> ugh
[21:25] <gdude2002> if it is, it's too much
[21:25] <visiON> no handlebars
[21:25] <Kizzycocoa> like, no new page creation for anons, but page editing priviledges
[21:25] <visiON> no handlebars
[21:26] <Kizzycocoa> sorta balances out
[21:26] <gdude2002> no, kill the anons
[21:26] <Quatroking> I want to keep the wiki as open as possible
[21:26] <gdude2002> :P
[21:26] <visiON> look at me, look at me, hands in the air like its good to be alive

[22:14] <NGgod> I personally have no clue
[22:14] <Notch> the base for the server is up, and the level and mob ai now supports multiple players
[22:15] <Lutin> Notch: Did you happen to see my tweet about raytracing?
[22:15] <copycat> Notch: where do you draw your ideas from, btw?
[22:15] <CyborgDragon> i found this crater in my snow world :D
[22:15] <bildramer> Notch, you did something wrong with your calculations, up to 12500000 the map generator works fine
[22:15] <Notch> the next step is to start working on sending terrain data from the server
[22:15] <Animator> Base of what server?
[22:15] <Fiskie> Wait what happens if snow falls on lava
[22:15] <Fiskie> Does it just turn to obs
[22:15] <Notch> that's probably one of the biggest things to solve right.
[22:15] <CyborgDragon> it melts, fiskie
[22:15] <NGgod> woahh, you have only been doing this for a few weeks and to me that sounds like alot of stuff
[22:15] <Fiskie> orite
[22:15] <Animator> Is this multiplayer you're talking abou, Notch?
[22:15] <Notch> yes
[22:15] <bildramer> yup
[22:15] <bildramer> :D
[22:15] <apieceofcode> notch, get ANY CRAPY version of multiplayer out, even if there are 90% bugs, people will LOVE it
[22:15] <gdude2002> can't wait :3
[22:15] <Animator> Oh dear God.
[22:15] <bildramer> ok, now fix jaggy movement
[22:15] <Prime_Intellect> ok guys
[22:15] <NGgod> SMP is going to be a big goal
[22:15] <bildramer> we can't move 5000000 blocks from spawn D:
[22:15] <NGgod> im sure
[22:15] <Prime_Intellect> vid linkage in a moment
[22:15] <Diablodoct0r> apieceofcode: No, let him finish it!
[22:16] <Notch> i haven't rechecked how well the map generator works now at long disgtances since I changed the mapgen stuff
[22:16] <sana> do you just eat tzatziki standalone? thats weird
[22:16] <NGgod> so many clans will start up
[22:16] <Prime_Intellect> i just made an awesome secret door
[22:16] <FNugget> Adventure/Quest mdoe would be cool
[22:16] <bildramer> indeed, sana
[22:16] <bildramer> probably as a dip for the chips
[22:16] <gdude2002> Gaise, there are ALREADY SMP clans around.
[22:16] <Animator> I'm caught between screaming like a schoolgirl, hiding in the corner before this whole thing blows out, or readying the banhammer on the future chaos coming.
[22:16] <NGgod> dont make minecraft too programmable
[22:16] <Lutin> Notch: I've got a base set up that will take an MC level and turn it into a sparse voxel octree. Right now I'm working on radiosity for diffure lighting and just using something like a phong shader for specular
[22:16] <Notch> I will release it somewhat broken, yes. But it has to do SOMETHING first
[22:16] <Kizzycocoa> hey guys, is it obsessive to make a log-room?
[22:16] <Prime_Intellect> oh hey it's notch
[22:16] <Notch> at the moment, the client can't even connect
[22:16] <gdude2002> yes, yes it is
[22:16] <Animator> All of the above, I guess.
[22:16] <Kizzycocoa> like, a room with small diary entries
[22:16] <Prime_Intellect> cool
[22:16] <Notch> which makes it really bad MP
[22:16] <sana> animator he will be gone in 20 minutes anyhoo.

[22:17] <copycat> remove block below iron door: *poof*, you can also dig around it easily
[22:17] <Drakerla> me is a big fan!
[22:18] <Kizzycocoa> like, underground bases
[22:18] <Notch> i am thinking about security and protection
[22:18] <Diablodoct0r> Well,
[22:18] <bildramer> Notch, you are updating so often it's nigh-impossible to lose interest in Minecraft :3
[22:18] <Fiskie> Minecraft is serious business
[22:18] <Kizzycocoa> yay! =D
[22:18] <Notch> neato :D
[22:18] <Bodie> guessing the land claim flags will be a server option right?
[22:18] <apieceofcode> when does server scripting come out? :D
[22:18] * goober (qcksilverd@216.60.71.0) has joined #minecraft
[22:18] <Prime_Intellect> yeah notch i must commend you on your reliable updates
[22:18] <Prime_Intellect> i myself am making a game and it's so hard to keep a schedule like that
[22:18] <Notch> i am in a very nice creative flow since I went full time
[22:18] <Prime_Intellect> at least, for me
[22:18] <apieceofcode> Prime_Intellect, you mean comment, not? lol
[22:18] <Fiskie> I'm not playing until next update because I'm not interested in snow and fancy trapdoors
[22:18] <Diablodoct0r> If you ask me, MP should feature: 1. Block ownership, 2. An automatic claim feature that makes everything within a square radius of connected blocks belonging to you
[22:18] <Prime_Intellect> no
[22:18] <Prime_Intellect> commend
[22:18] <bildramer> but the positions being doubles
[22:18] <bildramer> it hurts
[22:18] <Prime_Intellect> apieceofcode: what?
[22:19] <FNugget> we have traap doors?
[22:19] <Bodie> There are fancy trapdoors?
[22:19] <Notch> no automatic claiming
[22:19] <Animator> NOTCH WILL MAKE SMP IN THE STYLE OF NOTCH.

[22:19] <Lutin> trapdoors would be nice
[22:19] <Prime_Intellect> oh
[22:19] <sana> that's nice Diablodoct0r, but surely he has his own ideas.
[22:19] <Notch> get a mod to claim for you, or make a land claim flag
[22:19] <Bam1848> idd
[22:19] <Drakerla> Notch me is a big fan!
[22:19] <Prime_Intellect> one thing that bothered me
[22:19] <SireTRM> Oh, Notch, will there be the ability to *manually* control all special variable aspects of the game? [Snow, each and every type of mob, days, seasons]
[22:19] <Prime_Intellect> is that water cant go on pressure plates
[22:19] <CyborgDragon> notch, we need trapdoors for sand/water/lava/gravel traps :3
[22:19] <sana> wait...
[22:19] * Drakerla is drinking is coke
[22:19] * Animator throws message in the sea of oncoming messages.
[22:19] <Notch> no, siretrm

[22:19] <sana> flag as in property, or as in actual wavy flag on a pole?
[22:19] <Kizzycocoa> notch? how do you feel about your face popping up EVERYWHERE on the forums?
[22:19] <bildramer> Drakerla, you're doing it wrong
[22:19] <Kizzycocoa> XD
[22:19] <[JD]`> you mean floor doors?
[22:19] <copycat> Animator: caps? is it already time? ... time for +m?
[22:19] <Fiskie> YES A WAVING FLAG WOO~
[22:19] <bildramer> you inject coke
[22:19] <Notch> the face thing was weird
[22:19] <Prime_Intellect> Notch: one question: will water be able to flow over pressure plates at some point?
[22:19] <Notch> and I wear a hat these days
[22:19] <iKJames> This is the second time I've seen Notch in here.
[22:19] <apieceofcode> oh, its notch's face ?
[22:19] <bildramer> what PI said
[22:19] <Eversist> the face thing is hilarious
[22:19] <Kizzycocoa> yes. it is
[22:19] <Notch> I even went a bit crazy and ordered a really nice fedora from the UK
[22:20] <Henrick> Hey guys I am in a bit of problem in here. I just bought the game, but it isn't letting me change skins or download the client, it prompts me to buy the game again. Am I supposed to receive some code or wait x hours?
[22:20] <sana> The money is rising to your head!
[22:20] <Notch> it was a bit expensive, and it totally doesn't match the rest of my clothing
[22:20] <Animator> Notch probably wouldn't want me to mute the channel.
[22:20] <apieceofcode> fedora, thats a free OS ?
[22:20] <bildramer> Notch, please don't drink during football
[22:20] <Prime_Intellect> hey notch there is an interesting glitch
[22:20] <FNugget> Notch: If C418 made your face the album cover for his music, would you accept?
[22:20] <Prime_Intellect> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN0K35BxLGs
[22:20] <Animator> He's scanning each message.
[22:20] <sana> Animator, just don't worry.
[22:20] <Notch> haha, no, the hat
[22:20] <bildramer> so you can come here later

[22:20] <Xinia> Are you going to make us able to get snow on old maps too, or?
[22:20] <Prime_Intellect> oh wow the sound is ridiculous
[22:20] <Lutin> Notch: Would the level generator work if you bumped the max Z index up to 255?
[22:20] <SireTRM> Xinia, that is h4x-able
[22:20] <Notch> snow will be a regional thing
[22:20] <Prime_Intellect> :C too many people talking
[22:20] <Kizzycocoa> you can already
[22:20] <Kizzycocoa> NBTedit
[22:20] * gdude2002 back
[22:20] <bildramer> Notch, we need more height in Minecraft

[22:20] <sana> Will sky islands ever make a return?

[22:21] <Lutin> You weren't talking to me
[22:21] <Prime_Intellect> notch: will water ever be able to flow over pressure plates?
[22:21] <Diablodoct0r> Notch: How about making it seasonal instead?
[22:21] <Notch> it'd take about a day to make it run at all with 256, and the fps would drop to half

[22:22] <bildramer> Notch, do not use doubles, it would fix many problems if you'd use long doubles
[22:22] <Notch> if you save a summer chunk and load it when it's winter.. what should happen?
[22:22] <Prime_Intellect> Notch: i've found an interesting glitch that you may or may not be aware of regarding pictures
[22:22] <apieceofcode> "not a problem", I'm running minecraft at always 98% ram and 100%cpu, problem lol
