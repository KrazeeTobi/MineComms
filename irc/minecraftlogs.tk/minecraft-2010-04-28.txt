[2:59] <Animator> And deop/ipban him.
[2:59] <Visiiri> Emperor: What software did you run?

[2:59] <Visiiri> Custom or vinilla?
[2:59] <SpaceManiac> Anyways
[2:59] <Emperor> cpp
[2:59] <Emperor> or something
[2:59] <TrueWolves> I once got a rouge op on a server by logging in as my secret side account, acting like a normal player, BAM deop+ban

[3:00] <KodaichiZero> sorry guys later
[3:00] <Visiiri> how'd you get the server to allow 40 people on?
[3:00] <SpaceManiac> Oh, one of them is telling me to go cry in a corner
[3:00] <Visiiri> I've tried fucking with memory, but I can only fit 32 on mine without crashes.
[3:00] <Visiiri> Anyways, nvm that.
[3:00] <Visiiri> My best server had 24 people on it most of the time.
[3:00] <Visiiri> The maps were epic, too
[3:00] <TrueWolves> I think he means 40 regulars
[3:00] <TrueWolves> not 40 people at once.
[3:00] <Visiiri> Oh
[3:00] <Emperor> yea i used to make custom maps in forge
[3:01] * TD|Away is now known as TestDummy

[3:01] <Emperor> it was pretty awesome, some serious dwarfan was goin on
[3:01] <Emperor> lots of castles
[3:01] <TrueWolves> Have you had a map that IS a giant 450 block tall tree with a 500 block deep root system?
[3:01] <TrueWolves> The giant tree /was/ the map
[3:02] <Emperor> lol
[3:02] <TrueWolves> Branchs and stuff too
[3:02] <Rooster> OMG
[3:02] <Emperor> tree house city

[3:02] <TrueWolves> It has no host atm

[3:03] <TrueWolves> AndrewPH is someone I know
[3:03] <Emperor> i still have a b unch of maps from my server, lots of saves from stuff people made
[3:03] <TrueWolves> Well, he's an oldbie anyway
[3:03] <Emperor> one of my saves has an insanely large pyramid
[3:03] <TrueWolves> awesome.
[3:03] <Emperor> which does down into the earth hallowed out

[3:04] <AzureAngelic> giant lava pit
[3:04] <AzureAngelic> 2 layers down
[3:04] <AzureAngelic> below it is bedrock
[3:04] <Emperor> from the top you couldnt see the bottom with the second longest fog distance
[3:04] <AzureAngelic> trying to decide how to deal with it
[3:04] <Rooster> Do you guys use Omen to make your maps?
[3:04] <Emperor> ntb forge
[3:04] <Emperor> never tried omen
[3:04] <Rooster> Ah
[3:04] <KodaichiZero> I do somethimes
[3:04] <Emperor> i hear good things tho
[3:04] <TrueWolves> I used omen to make Yggdrasil
[3:04] <Visiiri> Omen is nice at generation.
[3:04] <TrueWolves> But that's becuase Omen was the only thing out at the time.
[3:05] <Visiiri> Omen was the only thing around when I had servers, too.
[3:05] <TrueWolves> Yggdrasil is before color blocks old (It's been updated though)
[3:05] <Rooster> I tried Omen and it looked mildy time-consuming/complicated
[3:05] <Rooster> Yggdrasil?
[3:05] <TrueWolves> Yggdrasil = The name given to my Giant Tree server
[3:05] <KodaichiZero> yggdrasil is fucking badass, I must say.
[3:05] <Rooster> I see
[3:05] <Rooster> I want it
[3:05] <Visiiri> It's an amazing map.
[3:05] <TrueWolves> Well, the base map file is "TreeBuild3.1"
[3:05] <Visiiri> I remember when you showed it off in irc
[3:06] <Visiiri> Wayyyyy before it was done.
[3:06] <Visiiri> I think you were working on the first level of branches.
[3:06] <TrueWolves> The one video Citric made?
[3:06] <Visiiri> Maybe
[3:06] <AndrewPH> TrueWolves, Have you tried converting it to an indev level?
[3:06] <AndrewPH> Might look cool
[3:06] <TrueWolves> I... have not
[3:06] <Emperor> http://gyazo.com/de1322b7b18ca8a13eaf962243bef368.png
[3:06] <TrueWolves> I don't know how.
[3:06] <Visiiri> It'd be epic if notch added one of those trees to infdev
[3:06] <Visiiri> when he gets biomes set up
[3:06] <AndrewPH> TrueWolves, open in newest omen -> save as mclevel
[3:06] <Emperor> it said "emperor" on the side, did it in ntb forge

[3:40] <Scrippy> yup
[3:40] <outsomnia> But anyways, back to my initial point, you can't prove that there is no way that a miniscule teapot doesn't exist somewhere betwene here and Saturn.
[3:40] <outsomnia> asdgkagae bold was meant to end after "prove"
[3:40] <MC_fanatic> And you can't prove there is
[3:40] <Malikat> that's because it's impossible to disprove something

[3:40] <outsomnia> what scrippy said

[4:08] <ZarroTsu> Cavestory hits big, is primarily looked down upon by a large populus, but when you play it and beat it, it's the best damn game you ever played
[4:08] <ZarroTsu> Hellsinker is like that
[4:08] <melibe> I think Gimmick is better than cave story
[4:08] <LuciferZ> 20 years old, suckas. Too young to drink, to old to stop now
[4:08] <ZarroTsu> only Hellsinker is Nintendo-Hard
[4:09] <outsomnia> You mean, go through pattern and wail on boss for a bit, repeat three times, win the game?
[4:09] <ZarroTsu> fast bullets, split-second reaction time, and memorization
[4:09] <Wervyn> There are people who look down on Cave Story? I'd expect lots of people who don't KNOW about it, but...
[4:09] <Konogan> Well, it's legal to drink at 18 in Canada :D
[4:09] <ZarroTsu> and the final boss is entirely in tune with the music.
[4:09] <ZarroTsu> And has 5 forms

[4:10] <TrueWolves> They play cave story, then rate it a 8 usualy with a half assed reason or off the graphics.
[4:10] <outsomnia> \o/ for hacked version of it!
[4:10] <ZarroTsu> Wervyn, there's a reveiw, that while I swear must be fake, says cave story is a piece of shit game because it was too easy for the reviewer, who clearly didn't beat the whole game, and if he did, couldn't establish the concept of "a new video game player"
[4:10] <SubBoy> Well query ZarroTsu: which touhou game did you beat for comparison?

[4:23] <legolord> well.. I didn't, but I have premiums
[4:23] <outsomnia> We're all using the default skin.
[4:23] <`Delta`> What's the verdict? Worth the price of admission?

[4:25] <Jxtom> bioshock ftw
[4:25] <`Delta`> Is Indev/infdev very fun? Is it a constant battle to fend of monsters, or do you actually have a chance to build stuff?
[4:25] <legolord> or get it free in 10 years
[4:26] <legolord> Delta, there is a peaceful option
[4:26] <TrueWolves> Depends what setting you put it on
[4:26] <Wervyn> Well there are lots of settings. But it's quite a bit different than the free survival mode.
[4:26] <`Delta`> oh there is? :D Nice!
[4:26] <melibe> theres a day/night cycle, delta
[4:26] <SubBoy> Plus even on normal, there's still time to build stuff.
[4:26] <legolord> and Indev is nice, infdev is riddled with bugs
[4:26] <outsomnia> If you manage your torches/buildings/territory well, even on higher settings, you'll do well enough.

[4:29] <Wervyn> Well you can always kill them. Or hide behind a wall. Or build a wall and hide behind it.
[4:29] <Konogan> Cruel, you made me lost...
[4:29] <Jxtom> D:
[4:29] <Konogan> lose*
[4:29] <`Delta`> :x They lose interest in you if they lose sight of you?
[4:29] <melibe> Ive been having alot of fun with the Dungeon Craft map
[4:29] <melibe> Ive almost found the pick axe :U
[4:29] <TrueWolves> I...
[4:29] <TrueWolves> I don't know
[4:29] <TrueWolves> It's hard to get them to lose sight of you
[4:29] <outsomnia> If you wander significantly far from them it's safe to assume yes.
[4:30] <coladash> if they arn't like 25 blocks near you they start walking away
[4:30] <Wervyn> I think so. If you walk far enough they probably despawn.
[4:30] <legolord> I cant find the god room
[4:30] <coladash> or something like that

[4:30] <`Delta`> I just remember playing SP survival and..
[4:30] <`Delta`> not lasting long
[4:30] <`Delta`> xD
[4:30] <legolord> ditto
[4:30] <legolord> I only lasted ~4 min
[4:30] <Wervyn> Heh. It's easier than that, more prolonged too.
[4:30] <outsomnia> Of course not considering you're punching bone.
[4:30] <legolord> indev: I last irl WEEKS

[4:31] <outsomnia> Me in in[no f]dev: "BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!"
[4:31] <`Delta`> So what kills you? Just mess up, or do you run out of resources?
[4:31] <Wervyn> Indev, you can generally get to the point where you're the lord of all you survey, if you play it right.
[4:31] <legolord> messing up
[4:31] <Wervyn> So, only if you mess up.
[4:31] <outsomnia> `Delta`, falling from significant heights, drowning, monster killing, falling in lava/fire
[4:31] <Wervyn> Letting a creeper get too close and explode, say.
[4:31] <legolord> all it is, is keep focus, do not let your guard down, don't be fooled by the games peaceful appearance
[4:31] <Jxtom> nao lets get the cainsawz
[4:31] <`Delta`> lava is bad
[4:32] <Jxtom> *chainsaw
[4:32] <legolord> Delta, have you played Dead Space?
[4:32] <TrueWolves> you have 9~10 hearts that signifi your life
[4:32] <TrueWolves> when they run out, your dead
[4:32] <`Delta`> Lego: yessir
[4:32] <legolord> Good
[4:32] <legolord> You can now survive easy
[4:32] <Jxtom> this is kinda like dead space
[4:32] <melibe> minecraft is nothing like dead space :U
[4:32] <outsomnia> The landscape of infdev compared to the old ones of indev and SP survival is spectacular.
[4:32] <Wervyn> I was cave hunting once and this fucking skeleton shot me and the kickback threw me into some lava. That one sucked.
[4:32] <Jxtom> like the room with infinate crawy things

[4:33] <TrueWolves> It's hard to fight
[4:33] <legolord> well
[4:33] <legolord> i have a supercomputer
[4:33] <Wervyn> I'm waiting for infdev to stabilize, but the concepts being developed are very cool.
[4:33] <outsomnia> More things work yeah, but it'll change as time passes by.

[4:33] <`Delta`> I wonder how fast it'd run for me
[4:33] <EmpiresBane> i finally got ungrounded
[4:33] <legolord> God I love being able to play infdev at 768 FPS
[4:33] <outsomnia> FNugget, minecraft in my #minecraft? ridiculous, I know, right?
[4:33] <coladash> my creative is 500+
[4:33] <FNugget> oh wait
[4:34] <coladash> indev is 130+
[4:34] <FNugget> i was looking at wrong window
[4:34] <coladash> idk about infdev
[4:34] <`Delta`> MP creative lags for me at times
[4:34] <Konogan> 468???
[4:34] <`Delta`> like
[4:34] <`Delta`> just a little
[4:34] <outsomnia> :P
[4:34] <Konogan> 768*
[4:34] <TrueWolves> My creative is 32 ._.
[4:34] <Jxtom> creative=9001
[4:34] <SubBoy> I notice that infdev runs faster than indev.
[4:34] <`Delta`> prolly drops to around 40-30

[4:34] <`Delta`> Anyway
[4:34] <outsomnia> Creative usually runs choppier for me, since there are more things to load.
[4:34] <`Delta`> Suppose I should play it
[4:35] <`Delta`> er
[4:35] <`Delta`> buy it
[4:35] <coladash> more things to load?
[4:35] <outsomnia> Also \o/ mediaaccelerator/integratedcard
[4:35] <EmpiresBane> infdev has cerian optimizations that indev doesn't
[4:35] <coladash> seriously?
[4:35] <`Delta`> Cause I do enjoy the stuff I've played so far
[4:35] <coladash> well l4d isn't loading
[4:35] <coladash> it said 9 minutes
[4:35] <EmpiresBane> also, creative has less to load
[4:36] <coladash> now its been 30
[4:36] <coladash> on the last 20%

[4:43] <Jxtom> well thats alright

[4:44] <outsomnia> outsomniazx, add me
[4:44] <`Delta`> Well I probably just suck. xD
[4:44] <outsomnia> noijk, I don't have a gamertag
[4:44] <Wervyn> Also the Hacker's Delight mod helped.
[4:44] <EmpiresBane> yeah, i used my eve just so i could pick up more vials
[4:44] <Wervyn> Because then it was like "oh a vending machine, haxored."
[4:44] <`Delta`> Anywho
[4:44] <Wervyn> And get some Eve in the process.
[4:44] <legolord> sendin'

[4:45] <Wervyn> Well sure. But still, wasn't at a lack for MP.
[4:45] <EmpiresBane> what?
[4:45] <Jxtom> bioshock 2s hacking is better
[4:45] <legolord> Delta, did you get it yet?
[4:45] <outsomnia> I'd livestream, but it'd just be a lolhacker fumbing around with architecture the whole time.
[4:45] <EmpiresBane> i was gonna borrow 2, but then my friend fucked up his disk
[4:46] <Jxtom> 5 hours+mp= me being level 21 on bioshock 2mp
[4:46] <Tor> do it then idc thats how bored i am
[4:46] <outsomnia> I never understood, why watch minecraft, when you can play it yourself?
[4:46] <Jxtom> ill livestream
[4:46] <Wervyn> I think our definitions of "MP" are different here.
[4:47] <Tor> out sometimes your fingers get tired.
[4:47] <Firetempest> architecture ideas from others
[4:47] <Tor> ok Jxtom

[5:07] <FoxtrotZero> Well, i could be a troll depending on your criteria. By my own I am not. My grammar is impecible, how could I possibly be a troll?

[5:10] <Commandhat> Multiplayer works to a point.
[5:11] <Zaneo> He let people play?
[5:11] <FoxtrotZero> I can't play minecraft ATM. Something to do with my bloody drivers.
[5:11] <Commandhat> Open it in IE, IE starts reopening the tab in compatibility mode (I count 7 times) before erroring.
[5:11] <outsomnia> >IE
[5:11] <Commandhat> Sometimes it actually opens multiplayer mode the 7th time.
[5:11] <AIex> You could try a different browser. :/
[5:11] <Commandhat> outsomnia: At least it's WORKING in IE. IT dosen't in firefox.
[5:11] <Commandhat> Or chrome for that matter.

[5:12] <AndrewPH> Commandhat, make sure the problem isn't between the keyboard and the chair
[5:12] <Zaneo> Heh
[5:12] <Commandhat> AndrewPH: durrrrrrrr. I've done nothing to java.
[5:12] <AndrewPH> FoxtrotZero, chrome sandboxes everything
[5:12] <Commandhat> Absolutely nothing.
[5:13] <AndrewPH> Commandhat, I didn't say to java
[5:13] <FoxtrotZero> Heres something; anyone think we'll ever have textures with resolutions better than an NES? Taehl is trying to retexture stuff and it only looks like crap because he's forced to make everything with pixels the size of my palm.
[5:13] <SubBoy> Well, is your java, browser, and drivers up to date? I know updating firefox fixed some problems I was having with sound for example. And it won't run at all on my hardware with default drivers.
[5:13] <Commandhat> FoxtrotZero: It's supposed to look like an NES.
[5:14] <Tor> http://www.livestream.com/azureangelic
[5:14] <AndrewPH> FoxtrotZero, SeanIvy was going to, and I think he still intends on doing so, but he's been afc lately
[5:14] <outsomnia> Well, there's always Cod:MW2, I heard they got a price cut recently.
[5:14] <AndrewPH> 32x32 everything
[5:14] <AndrewPH> instead of 16x16
[5:14] <outsomnia> And MW2 has good grafix doesn't it?
[5:14] <FoxtrotZero> I understand that its supposed to, and for blocks its fine, but I think we need at least SOME more resolution because its absolutely imposible to make armor and weapons visible
[5:14] <AndrewPH> outsomnia, and a great storyline
[5:14] <outsomnia> no
[5:14] <FoxtrotZero> 32x32 would be an excellent improvement
[5:14] <outsomnia> a BRILLIANT storyline
[5:14] <AndrewPH> not to mention you can host your own dedicated server
[5:15] <SubBoy> I think part of the reason is that for distant blocks, the pixes are already too small, and so until there's a ranged texture sawping mechanism (like many other games have) It's not practical, or the like.
[5:15] <KodaichiZero> Machoke has to wear a power belt to suppress its massive strength, and black shorts to suppress its massive penis.
[5:15] <Commandhat> Anyway just wanted to mention multiplayer works (A BIT) on IE.
[5:15] <cynicalAlchemist> Multiplayer/
[5:15] <Commandhat> It dosen't work in any of the other browsers, I've tried 10^100 timews
[5:15] <FoxtrotZero> I was also disappointed that you can't host custom texture packs serverside. I'd have my server set up if i could play. At least I know others can access it.
[5:15] <AndrewPH> Commandhat, works fine under every browser for me
[5:15] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[5:16] <Koko|MW2> FoxtrotZero, you can make fun of IE all you want, but Chrome rocks :>
[5:16] <Ty5479> Chrome is great.
[5:16] <FoxtrotZero> I'd take chrome before internet explorer and probably safari ANY day
[5:16] <AndrewPH> chrome sandbox's everything :3
[5:16] <FoxtrotZero> But i'm still a firefox fan. I have no need for silly lightweight applications
[5:16] <Commandhat> AndrewPH: Lots of IRC users have encountered this problem at least once... Java will suddenly quit with no error box when I try to open Multiplayer in Firefox/Chrome/...
[5:16] <Konogan> I'm oldschool, I use firefox :3
[5:16] <Commandhat> You can ask Animator.
[5:17] <AndrewPH> Commandhat, I wasn't saying they haven't
[5:17] <AndrewPH> I said that it works fine for me under every browser

[5:17] <AndrewPH> Yes
[5:17] <Commandhat> But not for us.
[5:17] <AndrewPH> for me
[5:17] <AndrewPH> I didn't say for you though
[5:17] <AndrewPH> now did I
[5:17] <Yourself> <SubBoy> I think part of the reason is that for distant blocks, the pixes are already too small, and so until there's a ranged texture sawping mechanism
[5:17] <Konogan> For me too.

[5:17] <FoxtrotZero> Anyway, with all the stuff Notch has pulled off proximity wise, i don't think adding in 32x32 bitmaps and then switching to 16x16 after about 50 blocks should be too difficult to pull off.
[5:17] <Yourself> he had some kind of texture filtering in a previous version of indev and a bunch of people complained for some reason
[5:18] <ZarroTsu> http://news.mmosite.com/content/2009-05-18/20090518233613293,1.shtml <- god dammit this looks so awesome T-T
[5:18] <ZarroTsu> (watch the vid)
[5:18] <FoxtrotZero> Because the bitmaps are already 16x16 maybe?
[5:18] <SubBoy> Ah, right, that stuff. Hopefully it'll come back sooner or alter though.
[5:18] <Commandhat> FoxtrotZero: In other words make a whole other set of textures that look exactly the same but are twice as big for looks!
[5:19] <FoxtrotZero> I remember in Halo, for high-poly models you almost HAD to make lower-poly distance models, because if you didn't, the engine tooled for computers about five years back would pretty much explode

[5:20] <SubBoy> Cool then, I wonder what method it uses. Something like gifs use maybe?
[5:21] <AndrewPH> SubBoy, wat
[5:21] <FoxtrotZero> i think it probably uses the graphics card, mate
[5:21] <Commandhat> AndrewPH: [20:19] <SubBoy> Though, does anyone know if it renders each block's surface separately?

[5:22] <AndrewPH> good question
[5:22] <FoxtrotZero> Graphics rendering, apparantley
[5:22] <AndrewPH> you use gifs to render blocks guise
[5:22] <Commandhat> He's talking about what textres some blocks like grass use for each surface.
[5:22] <Commandhat> *textures.
[5:22] <SubBoy> Uh, gif compression works by drawing rectangles of the same color in a shape, to make it easier to store.
[5:22] <AndrewPH> Commandhat, no he isn't
[5:23] * Ickum (hlaaluguar@97.90.113.128) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[5:23] <Yourself> ^^ the format is irrelevant anyway
[5:23] <FoxtrotZero> NEVER USE JPEG
[5:23] <Commandhat> ^^^
[5:23] <AndrewPH> jpeg sux
[5:23] <AndrewPH> png ftw
[5:23] <FoxtrotZero> PNG for everything
[5:23] <Commandhat> more up arrows here
[5:23] <FoxtrotZero> Gif actually dithers worse than JPEG. Gets all grainy.
[5:23] <SubBoy> So, if you have a wall of dirt, that is triangular, you could atleast combine all the verticle columns of the same texture into a single surface.
[5:23] <AndrewPH> fuck year I met more png elitists let's all have a part
[5:24] <AndrewPH> FoxtrotZero, gif is 16-bit

[5:24] <Tor> whoops
[5:24] <AndrewPH> or
[5:24] <AndrewPH> wait
[5:24] <FoxtrotZero> Which explains too much
[5:24] <AndrewPH> yeah 16 bit I think
[5:24] <AndrewPH> so 256 colors
[5:24] <Commandhat> Tor: don't you hate it when the enter key gets stuck?
[5:25] <Tor> yes command
[5:25] <Yourself> AndrewPH, 8-bit would be 256 colors
[5:25] <Yourself> 16 is 65536
[5:25] <AndrewPH> Wait
[5:25] <AndrewPH> to calculate how many colors it has it's n^2 rite?
[5:25] <FoxtrotZero> what format do you gentlemen save your documents in?
[5:25] <Wervyn> 2^n.
[5:25] <AndrewPH> I got 3 hours of sleep last night bear with me
[5:25] <SubBoy> I am pretty sure gif is 16(Maybe 24) bit color with an 8 bit palette
[5:25] <FoxtrotZero> no, n^2
[5:26] <SubBoy> Also, it's 2^n
[5:26] <Wervyn> Did you typo that or are you actually mis-correcting me?
[5:26] <FoxtrotZero> 2^n makes no sence, because that would be two to the power of N
[5:26] <Wervyn> Exactly.
[5:26] <FoxtrotZero> ..but its N squared
[5:26] <SubBoy> Yeah... 2^8=256..
[5:26] <Wervyn> Which is what it's supposed to be.
[5:26] <Wervyn> No, it's not.
[5:27] <IDTL> hell yeah png
[5:27] <Yourself> each bit you add doubles the amount of values you can have
[5:27] <FoxtrotZero> 8^2 = 256
[5:27] <Yourself> so you miltiply 2 by itself n times, which is 2^n
[5:27] <Wervyn> 8^2 = 64.
[5:27] <SubBoy> Er.. 8^2=64.
[5:27] <Commandhat> Youself: 256 million bits.

[6:15] <Firetempest> its called trying so hard to get the right thing yet fucking up, and she still loves it because of the sentiment
[6:15] <leBMD> what does that mean?
[6:16] <LuciferZ> Wait, that makes no sense
[6:16] <LuciferZ> Why is it unfortunate that you look on America poorly, if you want to break from your roots?
[6:16] <FoxtrotZero> It means i hate the corruption and general aire of failure. I mean, most europeans speak at least two languages fluently, and america has insane obesity levels.
[6:16] <leBMD> true
[6:16] <LuciferZ> Isn't that consistent, not unfortunate?
[6:16] <leBMD> so where would you rather be?
[6:16] <FoxtrotZero> Its unfortunate to have to think poorly of someone or something, because thats negativity

[6:18] <EmpiresBane> yeah, but the rest is wrong.
[6:18] <LuciferZ> I'm trying to get other people to stream on my channel
[6:18] <LuciferZ> It's more efficient, and everyone gets more viewers if we share channels.

[6:32] <vurtual> This ep2 map is horrifyingly scary

[6:33] <EmpiresBane> which one?
[6:33] <vurtual> enthralpy
[6:34] <vurtual> prefixed gm_ but it's for ep2
[6:34] <vurtual> Eventually I'm so paranoid, and I have to figure out what to do in a room full of unopenable doors and opaque windows
[6:34] <EmpiresBane> i don't remember that....
[6:34] <vurtual> then I hear stone grinding sounds, and the room has shifting floors.
[6:34] <vurtual> it's a custom map duh
[6:34] <EmpiresBane> it's not original?

[6:36] <Roadcrosser> what happens if a looped string goes through a portal and it closes?
[6:36] <vurtual> portals won't close
[6:36] <vurtual> or string is gradually unlooped
[6:36] <EmpiresBane> i think it's just cut
[6:36] * Beta (Raymond_Ma@209.115.188.61) has joined #minecraft
[6:37] <EmpiresBane> wait... how do you loop the string?
[6:37] <vurtual> via cutting
[6:37] <vurtual> slowly
[6:37] <EmpiresBane> if you have 2 paralel walls
[6:37] <EmpiresBane> woah
[6:37] <EmpiresBane> that'd be weird
[6:37] <FoxtrotZero> Closing a portal with an object halfway through is like shutting the cosmic blast door. That shit gets ripped in half

[6:38] <EmpiresBane> pulling on one end would create tension
[6:38] <Roadcrosser> the portal comentary says it pushes stuff out of the way when a portal closes
[6:38] <EmpiresBane> but, what if it can't be pushed?
[6:38] <vurtual> it'd eventually snap the string
[6:38] <vurtual> by pushing on it reallly hard
[6:39] <EmpiresBane> quick! someone make a string mod!
[6:39] <Roadcrosser> ...
[6:39] <Roadcrosser> YEA
[6:39] <Rooster> I made it
[6:39] <Roadcrosser> I think since the game didnt forsee this
[6:39] <EmpiresBane> time for crazy physics
[6:39] <Roadcrosser> the string just gets stuck in a wall
[6:39] <EmpiresBane> what?
[6:39] <EmpiresBane> no... it wouldn't be able to handle that
[6:39] <vurtual> okay I'm going to try to continue this map
[6:39] <Roadcrosser> the game wasnt designed for this string theory
[6:39] <EmpiresBane> it'd probably just freeze
[6:40] <vurtual> nah
[6:40] <vurtual> it'd just throw it out hard and be like
[6:40] <AndrewPH> Roadcrosser, in the source engine the engine may error and remove the entity
[6:40] <vurtual> closed, so the string is in the wall
[6:40] <AndrewPH> if it was completely impossible to remove it from the area
[6:40] <vurtual> and stops rendering right
[6:40] <EmpiresBane> vurtual, no, that would create 2 ends
[6:40] <AndrewPH> if it were possible in the slightest, it would force it out like your mom did you.

[6:52] <Firetempest> spaceship mmo
[6:53] <EmpiresBane> i get that it's a spaceship, but from what?
[6:53] <Wervyn> From EVE.
[6:53] <EmpiresBane> also, it's much cooler if it's 4 times the original
[6:53] <EmpiresBane> ok, time for google
[6:54] <Firetempest> some of the eve ships are a quarter mile long as it is
[6:54] <vurtual> In Mass Effect 2, they handwave magazines as "heat sinks".
[6:54] <EmpiresBane> so... make them one mile long
[6:54] <vurtual> Any remaining.... "coolness" is kept, so you don't waste... "coolness"
[6:54] <Firetempest> then i could just make a titan that already is a mile long

[6:56] <Firetempest> lets see, block is 1 meter, so.. 1 mile is 1,609 block long
[6:57] <vurtual> Why can't we just do it the cool way?
[6:57] <vurtual> Give everybody an ammo backpack/ammo device that holds ammo, and then just stick a mag onto it.

[6:58] <Yourself> more fleshed out and eloquent, but it was there
[6:58] <Wervyn> But not why each weapon has a different TYPE of heat clip.

[7:00] <ZarroTsu> http://dccollection.tumblr.com/photo/1280/550250492/1/tumblr_l1h3mnF8fr1qbr73o <- YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
[7:00] <Wervyn> Right. Like I said, I could justify "oh weapons have ammo now", it was in the codex. It's a bit retrofitted but it works.
[7:00] <EmpiresBane> what's weird about having different ammo for different guns?
[7:00] <Wervyn> Because the ammo is not really ammo, it's a modular device that absorbs heat.
[7:00] <vurtual> they're just.... heat sinks.
[7:00] <vurtual> It'd be like you have a bunch of thermally-absorbent stuff for your computer
[7:01] <vurtual> then you have to replace it
[7:01] <EmpiresBane> do all guns fire the same way?
[7:01] <Wervyn> In terms of game mechanics, I understand what they were going for. In terms of story mechanics it makes no sense.
[7:01] <EmpiresBane> no, otherwise there'd be no difference
[7:01] * Katnipz (Mibbit@dsl-69-50-49-112.pivot.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:01] <Malikat> so one really big thing i want to note about minecraft
[7:01] <vurtual> but you can't, because your other computer's heatsink is incompatable, even though they're functionally identical.
[7:01] <Wervyn> And yes, they do. They use different amounts of power, but they all work essentially the same way.
[7:01] <EmpiresBane> same principle
[7:01] <Katnipz> I'm not going to bed till i can have a plush creap next to me >:c
[7:01] <Katnipz> creaper*
[7:01] <vurtual> katnipz, make one
[7:02] <EmpiresBane> but the mechanics are different
[7:02] <vurtual> creepr.
[7:02] <vurtual> creeper*
[7:02] <Katnipz> to much work
[7:02] <Malikat> i spent like 10 hours working on a fourth iteration menger sponge the other day, and at the end of it i was dead tired, but i WANTED to continue
[7:02] <Malikat> i spent like 10 minutes trying to do it in omen and stopped because i couldn't keep going
[7:02] <vurtual> I think I'm going insane
[7:02] <Katnipz> what?
[7:02] <vurtual> I think... that I honestly liked the MOUT training in America's Army 2.
[7:02] <Wervyn> Not really. It'd make sense for you to have 10 sniper rounds OR 200 assault rifle rounds. But not 10 sniper rounds AND 200 assault rifle rounds but no switching one for the other.
[7:03] <Wervyn> But, you're not really going to get this unless you play the game.
[7:03] <Katnipz> alright i'm tired going to bed
[7:03] <vurtual> I'm being transformed into recruiiit aaaa
[7:03] <EmpiresBane> i played the first one
[7:03] <Katnipz> bai
[7:03] <Firetempest> eve ship scale in crysis, and put that into minecraft terms http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPeb547pis0
[7:03] <Wervyn> Right, and did you understand how the weapons worked there?

[7:04] <EmpiresBane> i assume they still use accelerated mass?
[7:04] <Wervyn> Yes.
[7:04] <vurtual> Hey guys does America's Army 3 have new training things?
[7:04] <EmpiresBane> i can't remember the terms
[7:04] <vurtual> railgun/coilgun/gaussgun?
[7:04] <Rooster> Oh god
[7:04] <vurtual> coiled-rail gauss gun?
[7:04] <EmpiresBane> they point is, what makes a sniper more accurate than a pistol?
[7:04] <Wervyn> Basically, the guns have effectively unlimited ammo because they fire microscopic chips of metal shaved off a slug.
[7:04] <vurtual> (normal bullets)
[7:04] <Rooster> I just accidently flooded an artificially giagantic Crater
[7:05] <Rooster> Shit went down
[7:05] <Wervyn> The limiting factor is the heat. And heat is heat.
[7:05] <vurtual> You mean you just made a nice new lake, Rooster?
[7:05] <Rooster> No
[7:05] <Rooster> a nice new /water crater/
[7:05] <vurtual> No, you mean a nice new fishing pond!

[7:06] <EmpiresBane> it's like a baloon. you can fill it with hydrogen or helium
[7:06] <Wervyn> Shaping, power, yes. But the idea is still, weapon generates heat. Weapon needs to not overheat.
[7:06] <Rooster> Eventually the flooding has to stop
[7:06] <Rooster> Right?
[7:06] <EmpiresBane> they both work the same way
[7:06] <Wervyn> And the "ammo" in the second game is something that gets rid of heat.

[7:07] <EmpiresBane> the react differently
[7:07] <Rooster> LETS TRY IT AGAIN
[7:07] <Wervyn> Right. One type of weapon generates more heat than the other.

[8:24] <FoxtrotZero> The tool's durability remains unchanged if you stop digging/cutting/removing a block before the action has been completed. Although in some cases such as sheep running infront of your shiny diamond axe while woodcutting, your durability is lost with no way to "react" and prevent it. (Don't cut trees near sheep)

[8:26] <vurtual> Do sheep near sheep though?
[8:26] <vede> Pigs are more safe.

[8:26] <Zaneo> They also like to shove you off cliffs
[8:26] <vurtual> with like, some sort of railgun wang?

[10:07] <Pl0x> does coal go on bottom
[10:07] <Azathoth> meat on top, coal on bottom?
[10:07] <Pl0x> k
[10:08] <Pl0x> nothing happens
[10:08] <Azathoth> you sure you're using coal?
[10:08] <Azathoth> and not flint?
[10:08] <Azathoth> which apparently looks somewhat like coal
[10:08] <kaboomarang> you dont get coal form gravle
[10:08] <Pl0x> oh
[10:08] <Pl0x> ..
[10:08] <kaboomarang> >.>

[10:09] <Azathoth> its only use is to make a firestarter thing with steel
[10:09] <Azathoth> which is pretty useless anyway
[10:09] <Pl0x> oh ok
[10:09] <kaboomarang> unless you want to burn stuff

[10:57] <Subhazard> America's Army is terrible. (repost)
[10:57] <Subhazard> If you want to play a military sim, play the original operation flashpoing, or ArmA
[10:57] <vurtual> nah
[10:57] <vurtual> I have ArmA 2.
[10:57] <Subhazard> flashpoint*
[10:57] <Moocmans-Alt> Agreed.
[10:57] <vurtual> I'm not playing it as a milsim
[10:57] <vurtual> I'm playing it like sp counter-strike.
[10:57] <Subhazard> The new operation flashpoint sucks, I here.
[10:57] <vurtual> Because coop missions are basically like some kind of decent sp counter-strike
[10:57] <Subhazard> hear*
[10:58] <Firetempest> tired of exploring, up to a 10mb save
[10:58] <vurtual> A bit of stealth, a bit of realism(hey, it isn't bad!), and reality ensuing constantly.
[10:58] <vurtual> To the point where one man armies are entirely possible!
[10:58] <vurtual> maybe AA3 will have explorable coop missions that don't give soldiers ridiculous health.
[11:00] <vurtual> Also obligotory comment about ArmA 2 player movement being like manually moving each limb slowly.

[11:27] <vurtual> Also I probably have some kind of military record where they track all my FPS playing via visible stat pages, and will probably want to bump me up.
[11:27] <IceGuest_75> Oh that sounds reasonable.
[11:27] <yoshibot> why would you even want to be front-line infantry
[11:27] <Azathoth> they'd be like "this guy has amazing hand-eye coordination. let's send him to sniper school!"

[11:37] <vede> IceGuest_75, dude. I'm not comparing bmp and jpg.
[11:37] <Rithiur> But unless the source is a sharp vector image, you don't really gain much by using a losless format.
[11:37] <IceGuest_75> Unless you consistently edit your jpg.
[11:37] <IceGuest_75> It compresses more and more.
[11:37] <vurtual> compress compress compress compress compress compress compress compress
[11:37] <vurtual> result: pancake
[11:37] <Hatred> xD
[11:37] <vede> Rithiur, I disagree.
[11:38] <Rithiur> IceGuest_75: Well, only an idiot saves working copies in jpg ;)
[11:38] <vede> For small images, lossy formats make things look like *shit*.
[11:38] <vurtual> hmm, what aa2 class should I use when running around, hmmm.
[11:38] <vurtual> Let's use an anti-material rifle!
[11:38] <IceGuest_75> No shortage of idiots wherever I go, man. Gotta educate.
[11:39] <Rithiur> vede: True, of course. I was just thinking about bigger picture. When each pixel matters, then you use losless formats, obviously.
[11:39] <vurtual> .50BMG some guys now.
[11:39] <vede> Yeah, photos and such are just fine as jpg.

[11:45] <IceGuest_75> So if someone is new to irc, wants an answer, and comes in to all these buttons and boxes, they get screamed out for not seeing the line of text at the top?
[11:45] <IceGuest_75> I don't know, man.

[11:45] <IceGuest_75> It just seems harsh.

[11:50] <vede> IceGuest_75, it's not about how easy it is.
[11:50] <vede> It's about people being retarded.
[11:51] <IceGuest_75> So retarded being, doesn't know the basics of IRC?
[11:51] <vede> They're given a big colorful message with answers to their questions, and they ignore it.

[11:53] <Hatred> Well then... how's everyone doing? :D Besides the two arguing about nothing important?
[11:53] <vede> IceGuest_75, I've already explained, it's not about being new.
[11:53] <vede> Seriously, you can't respond to an argument by assuming the argument never happened.
[11:54] <IceGuest_75> Wooooah this is an argument now?
[11:54] <vede> IceGuest_75, learn what words mean, please.
[11:54] <vurtual> Okay, this is becoming more and more of a problem.
[11:54] <IceGuest_75> So what, should I keep trying to have a discussion with you while we both have our own opinion? I don't see the point.
[11:55] <vurtual> I run out of ammo for my guns.
[11:55] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.59.176) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[11:55] <vurtual> I generally can easily sweep the map, but only one third, as there's not enough ammo to continue.
[11:55] <vede> I said "It's not about being now, it's about reading something." and you said that we shouldn't be harsh to people who are new.
[11:55] <vurtual> Unless I... CARRY TWO GUNS.
[11:55] <vede> You see the problem there, right?
[11:55] <Hatred> vurtual... shouldn't you carry three guns?
[11:56] <Hatred> :D
[11:56] <vurtual> pistol, rifle, rifle.
[11:56] <IceGuest_75> But they're *new*, sometimes they don't realize that people like you read EVERYTHING like they're supposed to. Sometimes it isn't that obvious.
[11:56] <vurtual> When my first sniper runs out, switch out.
[11:56] <vurtual> and then grab an extra enemy rifle for tetriary use
[11:56] <vede> IceGuest_75, we don't care that they're new.
[11:56] <vurtual> okay since I'm spawning wtih an extra gun, any suggestions on what it should be? One of them's an M82 sniper.
[11:57] <IceGuest_75> Right, so you burn them at the stake and I don't think it's cool. I thought we'd been there.
[11:57] <vede> If they can't or won't read things that they're presented with (it's not like it's hidden!), then they shouldn't be using IRC at all.
[11:57] <vede> IceGuest_75, so people who are new to IRC should be given some kind of reprieve on things like basic literacy?
[11:58] <vede> "hay gaz im not no wut u menz" "Please use proper English." "im nw 2 icr sory" "Oh that explains everything. Please continue."
[11:58] <vurtual> hehehe
[11:58] <IceGuest_75> It's not always a matter of basic literacy, really, dude. I can see the topic because I know it's there, but I can totally see how a newbie would miss it too. I guess I'm just perceptive like that, sorry.
[11:58] <vede> IceGuest_75, once again, the topic is not hidden.
[11:59] <vurtual> Two M82s, or an M82 and another sniper, or an M82 and an M4 sopmod... or maybe a rocket launcher?
[11:59] <vede> It's not hard to see.
[11:59] <vede> And in this channel, it's usually multiple lines long.

[12:00] <vurtual> the IED piles that just stun you, as barricades.
[12:01] <IceGuest_75> Lol, dude, okay. I'm not four. I've been in enough arguments to know that they sometimes don't end. Really. I disagree. Thanks.
[12:01] <vurtual> My M4 is basically a DM rifle anyways, with like... four hundred billion suns worth of ammo.
[12:01] <vede> I don't see why this one shouldn't end.
[12:01] <Hatred> You're not letting it die vede...
[12:02] <Hatred> Just stop talking about it
[12:02] <IceGuest_75> Because you won't be swayed, neither will I, and I've got a class in seven hours that I should really sleep for. :l
[12:02] <vede> Why would you not be swayed?
[12:02] <vede> Actually, fuck it, yeah.
[12:02] <IceGuest_75> It's a matter of opinion. I think I'm right, you think you're right. Neither of us can be convin- Kay. Lol.
[12:03] <Hatred> :D I win ^^
[12:03] <vurtual> this gun keeps jamming or some reason

[12:23] <Cintiq> change 'things'?

[12:24] <vede> You understand what open source means, right?
[12:24] <Cintiq> isn't notch planning to make mc open source eventually?
[12:24] <Cintiq> obviously not soon
[12:24] <Cintiq> but sometime
[12:24] <vede> Yeah, eventually.
[12:24] <Cintiq> but if a clone gets to the point of being equally as good
[12:24] <Cintiq> which i'm sure this one won't
[12:25] <Cintiq> but when it's actually competition
[12:25] <Cintiq> and it's free
[12:25] <vurtual> notch can always pull legal stuff I guess
[12:25] <Cintiq> i'd be pretty pissed if i was developing it
[12:25] <vurtual> making an exact clone

[12:28] <vede> And either way, if I had anything to do with an open source Minecraft 'clone' it would hardly be a clone.
[12:29] <vede> It be more of... a derivative work.
[12:29] <Cintiq> i mean, i don't have a problem with it being open source. only when it's at someone elses expense
[12:29] <mnjiman> I am sure Minecraft is important to Notch, but I also am sure that he is having so much fun with Minecraft he wont let anything bother him in its Development

[12:29] <Cintiq> true that.
[12:30] <vede> Cintiq, I don't have any problem with open source software taking control away from closed software.
[12:30] <mnjiman> so if someone did make a clone, he would continue working on minecraft until it didnt make anymore sense

[12:30] <Cintiq> mmm
[12:31] <vede> If people chose not to make an open source project because it might compete with something else, a huge number of things probably wouldn't exist right now.
[12:31] <Cintiq> i don't think i've really explained myself very well
[12:31] <Cintiq> meh.
[12:31] <mnjiman> besides minecraft was orginaly a clone off that infinamator game w/e its called
[12:31] <kaboomarang> infiniminer
[12:31] <mnjiman> ya
[12:32] <Cintiq> hmm
[12:32] <mnjiman> and hes also grabbing concepts from Dwarf Fortress (which im currently watching a freaking 6 hour worth of vids of tutorials on how to play lol)
[12:32] <Cintiq> so it is (look at the site)
[12:32] <Cintiq> ahahahah
[12:32] <Cintiq> yeah i've heard that game is a nightmare to learn
[12:32] <Cintiq> dos isn't it/
[12:32] <mnjiman> WELL
[12:33] <mnjiman> im half way through, and i know how to play now
[12:33] <Cintiq> i could probably get you in contact with some guys that actually play it
[12:33] <mnjiman> i think im good now,
[12:33] <Cintiq> kk
[12:33] <mnjiman> i just need to learn through practise now
[12:33] <mnjiman> fail a few times before becoming an expert
[12:33] <mnjiman> ^_^
[12:34] <mnjiman> the hardest thing about the game is the graphics.. which they actually have graphic packs so it isnt all ACCIS or w/e its called
[12:34] <mnjiman> so that makes it ALOT better
[12:34] <TrueWolves> DF?
[12:34] <Cintiq> those come by default?
[12:34] <TrueWolves> graphics are easy
[12:34] <Cintiq> of custom packs
[12:34] <Cintiq> or*
[12:34] <TrueWolves> the UI is the hard part
[12:34] <TrueWolves> well, I guess it varries from person to person
[12:35] <TrueWolves> depends how well you can mentialy visualize things
[12:35] <TrueWolves> The UI takes memory, the graphics takes visualization and reconizaition skills
[12:35] <mnjiman> ???
[12:35] <Rithiur> DF isn't all that hard game. It just has extremely unintuitive interface and the game pretty much doesn't bother to tell you anything about anything.
[12:35] <Firetempest> there are some 3d and retro isometric visualizers for DF
[12:35] <mnjiman> little happy face for dwarfs
[12:35] <mnjiman> no not default
[12:35] <Firetempest> http://code.google.com/p/stonesense/
[12:35] <mnjiman> ya
[12:35] <TrueWolves> The game is after all still in alpha
[12:35] <mnjiman> it doesnt seem hard
[12:36] <TrueWolves> At the rate it's gone, it won't be finished for 15 years
[12:36] <mnjiman> and the interface is improving slowly from what ive seen

[12:38] <TrueWolves> the game's physics have been made a LOT more realistic

[13:47] <vurtual> malikat
[13:47] <vurtual> where did you find aa2
[13:47] <vurtual> 2.8.5 isn't anywhere, just aa3
[13:47] <Bodie> its american military propaganda campaign thing isnt it?
[13:47] <vurtual> propoganda no
[13:47] <Bodie> its actually funded by the army
[13:48] <vurtual> half-recruiting-tool yeah
[13:48] <Bodie> yeah
[13:48] <vurtual> free FPS with the right mix of realism and fun? Yeah!
[13:48] <vurtual> Did I mention where I was carrying around an anti-tank rifle and M4, fighting through a village!?

[13:51] <vurtual> Actually, just messing around can be really fun, too, since there's loads of otherwise impossible combos and weapons, and foreign weapons to mess with.
[13:56] <Plinky> Wait
[13:56] <Plinky> AA3 has bugs AA2 is fine sorry.
[13:56] * cryzed (cryzed@i59F5C25D.versanet.de) has joined #minecraft
[13:56] <Plinky> My confusion.
[13:56] <vurtual> I can't update to 2.8.5 at all
[13:56] <vurtual> since the "deploy client" does not contact properly
[13:56] <Plinky> ArmA2 is better than AA, AA2 and AA3 imo though
[13:57] <vurtual> They're not even the same thing
[13:57] <Plinky> You sure
[13:57] <vurtual> You know, peeing's better than making waffles imo though
[13:57] <vurtual> AA2's like... more on the side of counter-strike.
[13:57] <Plinky> They are fairly serious
[13:57] <Plinky> fairly similiar*
[13:57] <vurtual> ArmA 2's a military training simulator
[13:57] <Plinky> similar*
[13:57] <Plinky> Yeah, that is what makes me prefer ArmA2, XD
[13:58] <vurtual> basically now I can't update AA2
[13:58] <Plinky> I told you, didn't I? Bugs!
[13:58] <vurtual> since AA3 probably took down all the servers
[13:58] <vurtual> :|
[13:58] <Plinky> AA3 is even more buggy though :P
[13:59] <vurtual> the only bug I have here is not having any servers holding the update available
[13:59] <Plinky> :P
[13:59] <Speljohan_> operation flashpoint is still da best military simulator there is
[13:59] <Speljohan_> !
[14:00] <vurtual> yeah back before ArmA and ArmA 2.

[14:00] <vurtual> It has rounds.
[14:00] <vurtual> Simple objectives, ronuds, standard servers, it's on unreal.

[14:01] <vurtual> It's not an operation flashpoint game
[14:01] <vurtual> they just bought the name
[14:01] <Plinky> O.o
[14:01] <Speljohan_> ^
[14:01] <Plinky> Eh
[14:01] <Broman> its actually spider solitaire
[14:01] <Broman> the screenshots are misleading
[14:01] <Speljohan_> ya
[14:02] <Plinky> I actually feel like ArmA 2 now.

[14:03] <Bodie> that Operation Flashpoint game was good
[14:03] <Bodie> dragon rising
[14:03] <Bodie> i quite enjoyed it
[14:03] <Speljohan_> i didnt like it very much
[14:03] <Bodie> it was a nice combination of simulation and fun
[14:03] <Speljohan_> was nothin like the original
[14:03] <Speljohan_> lack of simulation
[14:03] <Spoon8> I liked it, was pretty fun with coop
[14:03] <Bodie> yeah
[14:03] <Bodie> it wouldnt have been anything fantastic without coop
[14:04] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:04] <Speljohan_> i don't think i've ever played a game where coop is fun
[14:04] <Speljohan_> except for maybe diablo 2
[14:04] <Plinky> Like ArmA2 and multiplayer?
[14:04] <Bodie> really?
[14:04] <Bodie> the best games are coop
[14:04] <Speljohan_> oh and of course snes titles
[14:04] <Bodie> rainbow six vegas 2 was great

[14:04] <Speljohan_> they had sum nice coop stuff
[14:04] <Bodie> gears of war was decent
[14:04] <Speljohan_> but i prefer to fight my opponent
[14:04] <Bodie> gta4 had a few nice coop missions
[14:05] <Speljohan_> much more fun
[14:05] <vurtual> quake 3 wasn't coop :|
[14:05] <Plinky> I mean, ArmA 2 would not have been that good without online play and the most played where I live is Coop or Warfare modes.
[14:05] <Bodie> i like fighting my opponent too, but playing beside your friends is fun
[14:05] <Speljohan_> i like fighting friends more
[14:06] <Speljohan_> more adrenaline from that than pre-scripted mobs
[14:06] <Broman> i just fight my friends IRL more satisfying
[14:06] <Budda> i skin dead animals

[14:06] <Budda> world of fagfag
[14:06] <Speljohan_> ^
[14:06] <Plinky> I like NWN
[14:07] <Speljohan_> nwn is fairly good
[14:07] <Speljohan_> but it was too linear
[14:07] <Plinky> Really good for an old game.
[14:07] <Speljohan_> eh?
[14:07] <Speljohan_> it's not really old
[14:07] <Plinky> You don't play the campaign.
[14:07] <Speljohan_> it has fkn 3d graphics
[14:07] <Broman> planetside would have been amazing if the fps side of it was a little more polished
[14:07] <Plinky> You play multiplayer
[14:07] <Plinky> Also, the original isn't 3d and that is good.
[14:07] <Speljohan_> oh, you mean the 1991 one Plinky ?
[14:07] <Speljohan_> the mmo?
[14:08] <Plinky> Apparently original was great, I want to play it someday.
[14:08] <Plinky> And the Multiplayer of the modern one is awesome.
[14:08] * DarkEdge (DarkEdge@n040181.science.ru.nl) has joined #minecraft
[14:08] <Speljohan_> the mp is good, but the game is still too linear
[14:08] <Speljohan_> baldur's gate 2 is the masterpiece in rpg history
[14:08] <Speljohan_> best mp as well
[14:08] <Plinky> I just play ALOE, on the australian server GON
[14:09] <Plinky> Yeah, but BG2 sometimes has annoying mp, it can be stubborn.
[14:09] <Broman> preferred original fallouts
[14:09] <Plinky> Patapon is the best games with coop imo.
[14:09] <Plinky> For a psp game it is brilliant.
[14:09] <Speljohan_> tbh never had problems with bg2 mp
[14:09] <Speljohan_> perhaps i was just lucky
[14:10] <Plinky> Probably.
[14:10] <Bodie> whhhaaa
[14:10] <Bodie> news update

[14:10] <Plinky> And yeah Patapon 2 has my favourite coop mode.

[14:26] <Sparky20> vurtual why are tutorials bad?

[14:35] <vurtual> I find it mildly to incredibly dumb with what medical knowledge I do have, that all the symptoms are generic.
[14:35] <vurtual> I think I'm just gonna ignore this one so I don't throw up or go paranoid.

[14:36] <vurtual> yes
[14:36] <Sparky20> I played that.
[14:36] <vurtual> I'm going to have to give people a disclaimer that I only did the first two parts on my own.
[14:36] <mnjiman> Vurtual http://afteractionreporter.com/dwarf-fortress-tutorials/ is actually pretty decent
[14:36] <Sparky20> I got sent to prison before finishing the shooting range.
[14:36] <vurtual> So they don't go like HEY YOU DID THE TRAINING I MAGICALLY READ YOUR STATS AND FOUND THIS
[14:36] <mnjiman> but i found that video tutorials on youtube alot more detailed
[14:36] <mnjiman> but way longer
[14:37] <vurtual> This, combined with a quick sweep of the extra specific training, and the gradual escape & evade
[14:37] <vurtual> I will have finally, finally 100%d the training

[17:34] <Bodie> theres been steel and stuff for ages
[17:34] <Bodie> daimond
[17:34] <Bodie> etc
[17:34] <Bodie> but i havent found any iron ore in infdev yet
[17:34] <Budda> ye, i had steel tools, but they barely last for big projects
[17:34] <Bodie> but thats the idea
[17:34] <Bodie> you have to make a few
[17:34] <Bodie> stock up
[17:35] <Budda> i probably went through about 20 pickaxes just to mine to the bottom of the map
[17:35] * SpaceManiac (SpaceMania@r74-192-169-79.gtwncmta01.grtntx.tl.dh.suddenlink.net) has joined #minecraft
[17:35] <SpaceManiac> Budda: how'd you get out ;P
[17:35] <Budda> mines stairs on the way down
[17:35] <Budda> mined*
[17:35] <SpaceManiac> ah
[17:36] * SpaceManiac is so used to mining straight down because he usually plays creative mode
[17:36] <Budda> ye
[17:36] <Bodie> you can mine straight down
[17:36] <Budda> i find after a while on crative mode you run out of ideas of things to build
[17:36] <Bodie> because you'll loot just as many blocks as you go down
[17:36] <Cintiq> i hope notch doesn't add the 'all blocks fall' thing
[17:36] <Budda> either that or your stuff gets griefed
[17:36] <Bodie> to build up again
[17:36] <eritz> this is why i like survival mode better
[17:36] <Cintiq> or as soon as i log in my base is going to collapse ;-;
[17:36] <eritz> things you build are organic
[17:37] <eritz> shaped by your limitations, your desires, and your needs
[17:37] <eritz> and added onto piecemeal as you go
[17:37] <SpaceManiac> mmhm
[17:37] <rcfighter> Shaped by limitations, desires, needs, and the occasional exploding creeper
[17:37] <eritz> from a quickly-thrown-together bunker to help you survive the night
[17:37] <Broman> still hoping he adds a concrete goal
[17:38] <eritz> to a grand, sprawling castle with a courtyard and a fully-lit premises
[17:38] <Bodie> i dont think there needs to be a final goal...
[17:38] <Broman> can anything other than creepers destroy your base yet
[17:38] <Bodie> but it'll definitely need somethign
[17:38] <Bodie> not sure what
[17:38] <RavingManiac> the problem with zombie survival
[17:38] <Bodie> i trust notch to make it right
[17:38] <RavingManiac> is that zombies can tunnel through everything
[17:39] <Bodie> i think a cool idea... would be to have random temples and stuff generate in the map
[17:39] <Bodie> to explore
[17:39] <eritz> yeah, i always sort of wanted that too
[17:39] <Bodie> with chests at the end
[17:39] <eritz> it would be extremely cool to be digging along, and actually break into some kind of ruin
[17:39] <Bodie> and stuff
[17:39] <Bodie> yeah
[17:39] <SpaceManiac> that would be awesome
[17:39] <Bodie> i doubt it'd be overly hard to implement
[17:39] <Bodie> maybe notch is waiting til the expansion
[17:39] <eritz> maybe with a unique kind of enemy inside
[17:39] <Bodie> yeah
[17:39] <Bodie> big boss dude or something
[17:39] <vurtual> I got kicked out
[17:40] <vurtual> I accidentally clicked "give a tip", which brought me to 53 tabs in moments

[17:40] <Bodie> how long are the days?
[17:40] <Bodie> like, one sunrise to the next sunrise
[17:40] <Bodie> 15 minutes?
[17:40] <ZomBuster> underground ruin would just be a special cave
[17:40] <eritz> it feels too long
[17:41] <Bodie> yeah
[17:41] <Bodie> but so cool zombuster
[17:41] <vurtual> it's sooo short.
[17:41] <Bodie> thats what she said
[17:41] <ZomBuster> I mean that it wouldn't be harder to do than caves
[17:41] <vurtual> I could totally livestream me playing this game.
[17:42] <Bodie> wtf
[17:42] <Bodie> a uh... creeper just exploded and crashed the game
[17:42] <eritz> i guess night just FELT longer because i was playing before the mob numbers got fixed, and i had to cower in my shelter all night
[17:42] <ZomBuster> would be cool with some torches, treasure, and really hard enemies
[17:42] <Bodie> yeah
[17:42] <Bodie> but extra cool with switches and timers and stuff
[17:42] <Bodie> which will be implemented in the expansion
[17:42] <SpaceManiac> mmhm
[17:42] <Bodie> curiously... how big are everyone's files?
[17:42] <Bodie> the world files
[17:42] <Bodie> that they play on

[19:21] <Quatroking> Well, for example, minecarts

[19:21] <Zane> I remember the gears.
[19:21] <Quatroking> They'll probably come in wooden version first, upgradable to iron ones
[19:21] <Zane> Those were odd.
[19:23] <Zane> I imagine they would be useful for door mechanisms, to make better traps and self-sustaining machines.
[19:23] <Quatroking> automated cart systems

[19:39] <WordsHere> So, anyone about who could help me with a little Minecraft issue?
[19:39] <Marach-11> depends on the issue
[19:39] <WordsHere> It's hanging on the "Connecting.." screen in multiplayer on one server in particular
[19:40] <WordsHere> Usually I either get the single player creative mode or a "Failed to connect" screen if a server is down
[19:40] <WordsHere> Could this just be because it's down or might there be some other problem?
[19:40] <Marach-11> server is down or has problems
[19:40] <WordsHere> :[
[19:41] <Marach-11> did you check if anyone else can conect?

[19:41] * Randati (nnscript@a88-112-207-124.elisa-laajakaista.fi) has joined #minecraft
[19:42] <WordsHere> I don't know if this is THAT server, but I get the same problem on this one callled "NEW FLAT LAND!"
[19:42] <WordsHere> It says there's no one in it
[19:42] <WordsHere> Would it be listed if it weren't actually up?
[19:42] <Marach-11> yes.
[19:42] <WordsHere> So that's all the problem is then I guess
[19:42] <Marach-11> with right software you can broadcast anything
[19:43] <Marach-11> (it's called a "heartbeat" iirc)
[19:43] <WordsHere> Kind of dissapointing since if it were my end I could fix it and get back to work
[19:43] <Marach-11> so it used to work before?
[19:43] <WordsHere> Yeah, I had to crash Java because my mouse was stuck and I couldn't get back to the application or free it
[19:43] <WordsHere> And when I started it again I couldn't connect
[19:44] <WordsHere> I thought something had gone bad with Java so I restarted my computer but it still wouldn't work
[19:44] <Marach-11> it may be down already. refresh the list
[19:44] <WordsHere> This IS refreshed, I had to go back to the server list just now
[19:45] <WordsHere> This one is listed but I can't connect to ti

[19:45] <Marach-11> it shouldn't be the problem with you. assuming you can connect to other ones
[19:45] * Jake waves
[19:45] <Jake> hey folks
[19:45] <phil_> well for example if you run a mc-server on your "normal" pc (behind a router which does NAT)
[19:46] <phil_> you could let it register on the serverlist (outgoing connection) and still by default it would not be reachable for incoming connections (from the outside)=
[19:46] <WordsHere> Yeah, I can connect to other servers, like I said, but it was just not something I'd gotten before and I got it after a crash so I thought it was an issue on my end
[19:47] <Marach-11> it isn't.
[19:48] <WordsHere> I'll keep trying later today and see if the server comes back up, in which case that was the problem. Otherwise I'll... ugh

[22:08] <Azathoth> it's easier to get

[22:08] <outsomnia> I'm guessing better creeper protection
[22:09] <Azathoth> and better creeper protection
[22:09] <Jake> creepers don't attack though
[22:09] <Dommys> I ain't afraid of no ghosts
[22:09] <Azathoth> but mainly, it's more readily available

[22:09] <Azathoth> i'd rather just dig a huge hole in the ground
[22:09] <Dommys> Agreed.
[22:09] <Dommys> But I just hollow out what I want
[22:10] <Dommys> Instead of digging to bring rock to the surface
[22:10] <Azathoth> i like actually building things

[22:11] <Jake> other than dig out bloody everything looking for some diamond, what can I do?
[22:11] <Azathoth> at least for me
[22:11] <Azathoth> build stuff, jake :D
[22:11] <Chris220> I should probably make some armour
[22:11] <Dommys> Jake, imagine the coolest looking tower, or bridge, or anything
[22:11] <Chris220> but whatever :V
[22:11] <Dommys> And just make it
[22:11] <outsomnia> I'd leave the surface for good if infdev had underground cavern systems.
[22:11] <Jake> if the enemies were actually aggressive then I would feel more of a need to make some awesome defensive structure
[22:11] <Dommys> AGREED
[22:12] <outsomnia> And caves that aren't just indev-sized but absolutely HUEG and gargantuan
[22:12] <Dommys> Caverns and flowing water are all I need
[22:12] <Jake> but right now I've made a kick-ass glass-roof home with my own freaking sweet swmming pool
[22:12] <outsomnia> Also vertical caverns pls
[22:12] <Jake> I'd like some kind of door
[22:12] <Dommys> Vertical caverns after rope, pls
[22:12] <outsomnia> ^
[22:12] <outsomnia> Yesssssssssss
[22:12] <Azathoth> my personal goal in indev is basically to cover my entire map in buildings
[22:12] <outsomnia> Cool
[22:13] <Dommys> Do that in infdev.

[22:33] <Azathoth> but i don't use the other tools as much, so i use iron for them

[22:34] <Azathoth> i just hoard shit ><
[22:34] <Firetempest> hope diamond becomes better seeded, like in hell/volcano biodomes
[22:34] <rbos> there's two schools of thought, iron pickaxes mean you find ore faster (and thus get more iron), but stone lets you keep more iron for yourself
[22:34] <rbos> I find that using stone nets you more iron/hr

[22:38] <Azathoth> that's not as fun -_-
[22:38] <Zaneo> I can see more though
[22:38] <rbos> if you dig shafts spaced apart, you have way more chances to get ore
[22:38] <Zaneo> in the long run
[22:38] <Zaneo> i can see a wider scope
[22:38] <rbos> I guess if you're going for pretty, open pit looks better
[22:38] <Azathoth> yeah
[22:38] <Zaneo> Just like in real life each have there own uses
[22:39] <rbos> I have like 200 iron blocks saved up :P
[22:39] <Mosslander> also a large pit gives you room for stairs, and you can branch out from the sides.
[22:39] <Azathoth> but if was specifically hunting for ore, i'd probably use different methods
[22:39] <Jake> and what good is that iron?
[22:39] <Mosslander> Armor.
[22:39] <rbos> IT IS MY PRECIOUS.
[22:39] <Dommys> I like to dig pits, but I often find myself on "autodig" digigng single column trenches
[22:40] <Zaneo> i idg my pits while watching something like doctor who
[22:40] <Zaneo> dig*
[22:40] <Azathoth> i've got several hundred bars of iron saved up also, and i don't really have a use for it ><

[22:40] <Azathoth> i have plenty of arrows
[22:40] <rbos> I dig a long "starter" tunnel, then branch off it horizontally, sealing off as I go. Assuming that ore is evenly and randomly distributed, it really doesn't matter how you arrange it, as long as you check as many blocks per hole dug as possible

[22:41] <Dommys> rbos, you use too much math in your digging.. I let passion fly.
[22:41] <rbos> hahah
[22:41] <Mosslander> Heh. My plan is to dig three shafts, one for stairs, one for sunlight, and one for water. Then I'll use the light and water to farm, so I'll have a food-suply deep in the tunnels.
[22:41] <Dommys> LET THE PICK BE YOUR GUIDE
[22:41] <rbos> I played a WoW raid tank for 3 years, theorycrafting is automatic
[22:41] <rbos> always looking for that 1% edge
[22:41] <Azathoth> ugh
[22:41] <Dommys> That sounds... horribly boring.
[22:41] <Firetempest> ugh
[22:42] <Azathoth> yeah
[22:42] <Azathoth> i don't get how people can play wow like that
[22:42] <rbos> raiding is fun :)
[22:42] <Azathoth> i though games were supposed to be fun, not work
[22:42] <Mosslander> I've started digging shafts with dynomite.
[22:42] <Stev> somebody explain survival mode on this game to me
[22:42] <rbos> hahah those are fun
[22:42] <Dommys> dude, if I equip my purple axe of the lewtz during x_mobs rampage attack I can do an extra 13 damage per attack
[22:42] <Firetempest> i liked the exploring and missions, not the end game raiding of the same thing for weeks. i was the minority
[22:42] <Dommys> :/
[22:42] <Dommys> Who... cares.
