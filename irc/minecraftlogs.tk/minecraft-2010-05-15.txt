[1:50] <vurtual> no, driven insane by a magical spell to calcualte the optimal route
[1:50] <vurtual> so complex was it, that his very mind was unsewn from the fabric of the universe
[1:50] <vurtual> leaving his brainless husk
[1:51] <vurtual> some way that he willed himself to a higher plane
[1:51] <vurtual> after discovering the true nature of the world.

[2:49] <EmpiresBane> and chatzilla is it's irc client
[2:50] <blaster> making it even easier to invade
[2:50] <blaster> It resulted in half the users quiting and half of the people who did not quit continued their furfaggotry

[3:16] <vurtual> spinning slows them down to level 1 speed for a split second, so you could try spinning really quickly to slow the impact speed, but it's hard.

[3:29] <Rooster> lol
[3:30] <vurtual> his dropped weapon would be a cordless drill, and if you got hit while in the air, you dropped it, and the battery would pop out when it hit something.

[5:02] <vede> Yourself, yeah, THAT does.
[5:02] <Yourself> you can still do that if verify names is off
[5:02] <vurtual> granted an 8 bit rate will sound like static garble
[5:02] <blaster> I will begin 2moro, gota sleep ya know
[5:02] <vede> But now you can connect via &override=true
[5:03] <vurtual> so may aswell just do a midi
[5:03] <blaster> 16 bit then?
[5:03] <Yourself> the alternative if verify names is on is to say override=true
[5:03] <vurtual> it'll sound cheaply-recorded gibberish, blaster
[5:03] <Yourself> i was never wrong
[5:03] <blaster> Eh never mind, i can proberbly work out a way to make is sound older than 1950's

[5:04] <vede> Why?
[5:04] <vurtual> screw with their heads
[5:04] <vurtual> :D
[5:04] <Yourself> because there have been people who have it turned off
[5:04] <Yourself> i've seen people in here give advice to turn it off if it's a private server
[5:04] <vede> That was really only much of a problem in the month or so after that fix.
[5:04] <Yourself> and because it takes very little effort to check
[5:05] <vede> Nowadays it's a non-issue.

[6:19] <Kodaichi> jesus
[6:19] <Kodaichi> let's talk about something more interesting
[6:19] <eritz> and, really, i never see over9000 anymore
[6:19] <Kodaichi> hey wait Minecraft?
[6:20] * jayther (tentenaga@76-240-174-33.lightspeed.irvnca.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[6:20] <Animator> Guys. Pie. Talk about it.
[6:20] <Kodaichi> :) or am I just dreaming
[6:20] <Annihilator> pie
[6:20] <Annihilator> definitely
[6:20] <Animator> It's delicious.
[6:20] <Dommys> I never liked pie
[6:20] <Kodaichi> the pie is a fake, from what I hear
[6:20] <Dommys> Unless it was Rhubarb
[6:20] <TheClassiestMedic> Great
[6:20] <EmpiresBane> well then, you should leave wherever you live. 4chan is not an integral part of the culture elsewhere
[6:20] <Kodaichi> it's actually CHERRY.
[6:20] <TheClassiestMedic> I'm down to two faps per second
[6:20] <Annihilator> let's not talk about 4chan or stupid memes ok
[6:20] <TheClassiestMedic> D:
[6:20] <Dommys> EmpiresBane, you're just oblivious.
[6:20] <eritz> >implying half of this channel isn't made of 4channers
[6:21] <Annihilator> hoping
[6:21] <EmpiresBane> no. i've been around
[6:21] <Kodaichi> TheClassiestMedic: Do you have a physical problem? that's really damn slow
[6:21] <eritz> you realize that this game is only as big as it is because /v/ started talking about it, right?
[6:21] <Dommys> If you haven't noticed the wildfire spread of 4chan memery onto the countries entertainment sources at large.. :D
[6:21] <Dommys> eritz, old argument is old.

[6:21] <eritz> true argument is true
[6:21] <eritz> doesn't matter how old it is
[6:21] <Kodaichi> eritz: who cares
[6:22] <Kodaichi> brb'ing
[6:22] <eritz> it's just that it's silly to expect people not to talk about 4chan, when half this channel visits it regularly
[6:22] <wry> i want a vote to find out if it truly is half
[6:22] <Dommys> Doesn't need respoken, everyone's aware that tons of /v/ kiddies swarm to any free game to either entertain themselves due to how boring /v/ is, or to troll.
[6:22] <eritz> honestly? it's probably more
[6:23] <Yourself> people actually visit 4chan?
[6:23] <eritz> free game?
[6:23] <eritz> uhhhhhhhhh
[6:23] <Dommys> I did, the other day, posted on /g/ and saw nothing but trolling. :D
[6:23] <eritz> did you not notice the rate at which minecraft SALES accelerated post-/v/?
[6:24] <Kodaichi> back
[6:24] <Dommys> eritz compared to the rate that free players increased?
[6:24] <eritz> that information is extraneous
[6:24] <eritz> the fact is, a shitton of people bought minecraft because they heard about it on /v/
[6:24] <eritz> and a ton of people are probably here for the same reason
[6:25] <wry> not i
[6:25] <Kodaichi> okay okay. But if you REALLY know anything about 4chan, you know rules 1 and 2.
[6:25] <wry> i found out about it from a friend
[6:25] <Dommys> "Pillsbury: 50,000 cars stolen in Samoa every year. Motown: Well, a million in Detroit. Pillsbury: Detroit has 50 million cars. Samoa, 50,000. Every one stolen. "
[6:25] <wry> and he didn't find it on 4chan
[6:25] <eritz> if you know anything about 4chan, you'd know that rules 1 and 2 apply during raids
[6:25] <Dommys> quoted from Land of the Dead
[6:25] <eritz> also, rules 1 and 2 apply to /b/, not /v/
[6:25] <Kodaichi> when did we mention raids
[6:25] <Kodaichi> and also I wasn't picking on /v/ either
[6:26] <Dommys> Kodaichi..
[6:26] <Kodaichi> go ahead and talk about your /v/
[6:26] <Dommys> You don't get it
[6:26] <Dommys> The rules mean nothing.. they're "newfag" bait.
[6:26] <Kodaichi> Dommys :|
[6:27] <Kodaichi> you just lost the game
[6:27] <Kodaichi> I'm outta here for tonight guys
[6:27] <Dommys> Byeeee
[6:27] <wry> don't leave me with these 4channers...
[6:27] <eritz> i wouldn't expect that the 'rules' were created to troll newfags
[6:28] <eritz> considering rules 1 and 2 are 'don't talk about /b/', ostensibly to prevent newfags from being present
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> the rules are obviously wrong
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> and i thought 1 and 2 were /v/?
[6:28] <eritz> no, it's definitely /b/
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> besides, there's no folder icon porn
[6:29] <eritz> doesn't that fall under rule 35?
[6:29] <eritz> 'if there is no porn of it, someone must create porn of it immediately'?
[6:29] <EmpiresBane> i'd like to see someone make some porn only useing the folder icon
[6:30] <eritz> /r/equest it
[6:30] * vurtual drags a folder icon over another folder icon, imitating humping
[6:30] <vurtual> and there you go
[6:30] <EmpiresBane> also, the no girls one has been proven wrong
[6:30] <EmpiresBane> don't know about the child one, though
[6:30] <vurtual> NO GIRLS ON THE INTERNET.

[6:49] <revenant> wood and gold would most likely be the enchantable types.
[6:49] <Kratospie> Wood is supposed to be useless
[6:49] <vurtual> gold is meant to be useless, not wood
[6:49] <EmpiresBane> no
[6:49] <revenant> well, it could be made... less useless.

[7:00] <Kratospie> yeah

[7:00] <EmpiresBane> it's a terrible o dea
[7:00] <Kratospie> unless you fill the entrance with soil or something

[7:29] <Visiiri> You can go and launch a probe towards the planets for minerals
[7:30] <Visiiri> When you probe Uranus, EDI says "Really... commander?"
[7:30] <vurtual> F1-F9 for quick spellcasting
[7:30] <Visiiri> Or even inventory grabs
[7:31] <vurtual> I cast conjure weapon
[7:31] <Visiiri> I cast Bind Boots
[7:31] <EmpiresBane> I cast MOTHERFUCKING-BLACK-HOLE
[7:31] <vurtual> should use the wear-percent bars to indicate how long until it recharges
[7:31] <vurtual> so I can know when to cast my eclipse spec
[7:31] <EmpiresBane> that one never ends good
[7:32] <Visiiri> Probing Uranus
[7:32] <Visiiri> probing your anus, commander shepard- a quote from sex with grunt
[7:32] <vurtual> hah
[7:33] <Dysgalt> http://youtube.com/watch?v=ihMFtYB4rec Visiiri helped decapitate someone
[7:33] <vurtual> I could think of a few good places to probe
[7:33] <vurtual> with your skull
[7:33] <Dysgalt> Your going to probe someones anus with visiiris skull?
[7:33] <Dysgalt> :/
[7:33] <vurtual> no, myself.
[7:33] <vurtual> Break their limbs, rip off their skin and muscle, then pleasure myself with their still-living head.
[7:33] <Dysgalt> your going to probe yourself anally with your skull?
[7:34] <Dysgalt> oh

[7:52] <EmpiresBane> skills THEY choose?
[7:52] <vurtual> yeah, from a bunch of options
[7:52] <vurtual> starts off with a guy who's unable to do anything beyond sneak around a bit and bash people in with random objects
[7:52] <EmpiresBane> THEY or HE?
[7:52] <vurtual> they as in singular they
[7:52] <EmpiresBane> ok
[7:53] <EmpiresBane> why don't you make a source mod?
[7:53] <vurtual> because visual studio is trying to mug me, that's why
[7:53] <Kodaichi> so
[7:53] <vurtual> then over time he/she/it can go invisible temporarily or even permenantly if they wanted, even use military equipment, or quickly hack their computers.

[7:53] <Kodaichi> hide out for a while until you're uber-freaking-awesome and then pwn everyone? sounds awesome
[7:53] <EmpiresBane> what doe sthat have to do with source mods?
[7:53] <vurtual> so it goes from "find the crazy hobo in the vents" to "superbeing hunting us"
[7:53] <Kodaichi> or pick off the little bugger while he's weak.
[7:53] <Kodaichi> classy
[7:54] <vurtual> and the soldiers can set up a base, so they don't end up just walking around defenseless.
[7:54] <Kodaichi> for one thing\
[7:54] <Kodaichi> I'd be spending my entire time searching for the dude, NOT setting up a base
[7:54] <vurtual> if the one guy hides for too long, he'll quickly be outclassed by the marines.
[7:55] <vurtual> But if the guy gets a kill or two, he'll advance more quickly, so the marines will be helpless just roaming.
[7:55] <Kodaichi> yeah
[7:55] <EmpiresBane> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjSntjHBQn0&feature=related
[7:55] <Kodaichi> set up a base AFTER he gets a kill or two.
[7:55] <Visiiri> PHAWTAWSHAWP FTW
[7:55] <vurtual> by then he'll probably screw with your buildings
[7:56] <Kodaichi> mine? or someone else's?
[7:56] <vurtual> all of them
[7:56] <Kodaichi> lol
[7:56] <EmpiresBane> your teams
[7:56] <Kodaichi> and who says he gets a kill
[7:56] <Kodaichi> we all stand in a circle
[7:56] <vurtual> he'd probably get a level or two while you search for him
[7:56] <vurtual> then he grabs an exploding barrel and chucks it at you with some ability
[7:56] <EmpiresBane> he levels up even without kills
[7:56] <Kodaichi> we all search for him in one massive group
[7:56] <EmpiresBane> kills just speed up ther rate
[7:57] <vurtual> or attacks you with construction equipment, bowling you over, while you don't even know if he's inside or not
[7:57] <Kodaichi> we all search for him inside one huge vehicle.
[7:57] <vurtual> then he'll just wait
[7:57] <vurtual> inside some vent, which you can't find him in, because you have no fancy scanning equipment of any kind
[7:58] <Kodaichi> so what are you saying is the ideal way to play this
[7:58] <Visiiri> So...
[7:58] <vurtual> set up a base, then hunt him down with all your fancy gear
[7:58] <Visiiri> I'm bored.
[7:58] <vurtual> and try not to get killed or picked off
[7:58] <vurtual> Set up a base too late, he could take hacking levels by then, and set up your insecure computers to blow up violently when logged into.
[7:58] <Visiiri> LG_Legacy, want to play L4D2 with me? <3
[7:59] <Kodaichi> so we have to set up early so we can have anti-hack technology
[7:59] <vurtual> yeah
[7:59] <vurtual> It'll be the marines ability to keep themselves safe, and ability to work towards a common goal, vs one guy's potential to screw with you.
[8:00] <Kodaichi> also can't we give away his location as soon as we spot him?
[8:00] <vurtual> he could probably run away.

[8:57] <Visiiri> That's not the point.
[8:57] <vurtual> Okay, troops have to deal with that kind of problem a thousand times over, risking getting killed for screwing up.
[8:57] <Visiiri> There's no way to justify murder of innocents.
[8:57] <vurtual> They had no idea it was a friendly.
[8:57] <Visiiri> That doesn't matter.
[8:57] <Visiiri> They killed before they knew.

[8:57] <vurtual> What would you do?
[8:57] <Visiiri> They didn't think that.
[8:58] <vurtual> If you aren't lying, you'd obviously shoot at something the moment it has the "KILL YOU DEAD GUN"
[8:58] <Cial> this argument is pointless the war is pointless we could end it 100x over in 15 minuets if we wanted to
[8:59] <Cial> anyway goodnight

[9:00] <vurtual> vede, I had made a funny comment about interrogation methods.
[9:00] <Visiiri> Yeah! Those japanese bastards could've shot us!
[9:00] <vurtual> then Visiiri got all WELL THEY SHOT AN INNOCENT
[9:00] <Visiiri> More than one, of course.
[9:00] <Visiiri> And besides, the point remains.
[9:01] <vurtual> THEY SHOT AN INNOCENTS, THIS IS UNTHINKABLE, EVEN IF THEY COULDN'T ACTUALLY TELL, WE MUST HATE THEM BECAUSE HATING THEM IS COOL RIGHT
[9:01] <vede> I'm gonna go ahead and side with Visiiri on this one.
[9:01] <Cial> also why is the US trying to take over a place that the Catholics eventually said fuck it to
[9:01] <Visiiri> vurtual: That's your jaded-ass opinion.
[9:01] <Visiiri> They murdered quite a few people who weren't acting hostile.
[9:01] <vurtual> Right.
[9:01] <Visiiri> Because they can't see the guns.
[9:01] <vurtual> And this makes them demons, right.

[9:02] <vurtual> Aaand?
[9:02] <Cial> i mean if those crazy fucks gave up on it what chance do the under informed US army recruits have?
[9:02] <Visiiri> Aaand there's no reason to simply kill people.
[9:02] <vurtual> It's already happened.
[9:02] <Visiiri> And?
[9:02] <vede> I'm getting pretty sick of jokes about wars and shit.
[9:02] <vurtual> No matter how much you call them out on it on a random IRC channel, you're not reviving anyone, or in any way helping that.
[9:03] <vede> vurtual, the only reason a person might talk about the death of innocents (or anyone) is in an attempt to bring them back from the dead?
[9:03] <Visiiri> United States of Insanity- What's a few lives to us? We're blindly following our political leaders as they lie bluntly to our faces and hide important shit from us! It doesn't matter if just a few people die, rgith? It couldn't be us.
[9:03] <Cial> vede is like some troll war all they are doing is trying to piss each other
[9:03] <Cial> *is this
[9:04] <vede> *this is?
[9:04] <Cial> crap let me edit that statement
[9:04] <Visiiri> It probably doesn't help much that these guys happened to be war photographers, either.
[9:04] <Cial> vede is this like some troll war all they are doing is trying to piss each other off about a topic that no one has any control over and might as well be pointless
[9:04] <vede> I'm also sick as crap about the "ends justify the means" attitude that seems to propagate all over the place.
[9:04] <Visiiri> ^
[9:05] <vede> Cial, was that a question?
[9:05] <vede> Or a statement?
[9:05] <Cial> both
[9:05] <Cial> im good like that
[9:05] <vede> Impossible!
[9:05] <Visiiri> I wish Quatroking was on :(

[9:08] <vurtual> Nukes back then didn't kill everything on the spot, and we were also in a world war.
[9:08] <Visiiri> They were bringing war to us with limited just cause
[9:08] <vurtual> and there was no risk of anyone doing anything about it
[9:08] <vurtual> "What will you do about our nuking? We'll nuke you too. We're the only people who can."
[9:08] <vurtual> Aanyways, I think I'm gonna leave the tactical and strategic stuff to the guys who do the tactical and strategic stuff for a job.
[9:09] <Cial> but yea i hate the war i think that the middle east needs to be left the hell alone there is a reason that every large empire left the the hell alone
[9:10] <Visiiri> Well, I see some major flaws in various logic situations here.
[9:10] <vurtual> All those people doing it are probably very good at figuring out what's the best idea for these types of situation.

[9:11] <Visiiri> We're there because there's a terrorist organization there; this oganization brought the fight to us. However, they are also oppressive to their people.
[9:11] <Visiiri> vede: You forgot 3=====D
[9:11] <Visiiri> Bombing wouldn't actually help anyone.

[9:15] <Visiiri> Manslaughter can be accidental aswell.
[9:15] <Visiiri> And how can you SHOOT someone OVER AND OVER without trying?
[9:15] <Visiiri> :

[9:16] <vurtual> they're soldiers, it's their job to shoot at enemies.

[9:16] <vurtual> thinking they were person B?
[9:17] <vede> How would that make them less guilty?
[9:17] <Visiiri> Is there really a difference?
[9:17] <vurtual> They weren't out to murder anyone

[9:18] <Keiya> The Source engine and its map editor are fixed as using imperial units.
[9:18] <Keiya> /AND/ they're not even consistant. For most things it's 16 units = 1 foot, but characters are 12 units = 1 foot (1 unit = 1 inch)
[9:18] <Keiya> (Skyboxes and skybox props are at a different scale, out of necessity. 1 unit = 1 foot)
[9:18] <vurtual> 16 inches isn't a foot in source.
[9:18] <vurtual> it's a block of 16 inches
[9:19] <Keiya> vurtual: No, 16 'units' is one foot
[9:19] <Yourself> um, what?
[9:19] <vurtual> Where is it defined as a foot?
[9:19] <Visiiri> vurtual: In your cock.
[9:19] <vurtual> I don't even remember seeing feet anywhere.
[9:19] <vurtual> just inches.
[9:19] <Keiya> vurtual: The documentation and I assume the distance calculations used in game
[9:20] <Yourself> a unit could be anything, you need a reference to give it a real world unit
[9:20] <Keiya> vurtual: It's different for different things. Character models are 1 unit = 1 inch
[9:20] <vurtual> all the distances are inches to powers of 2.
[9:20] <Rooster> Lua hurts my tiny brain
[9:20] <Rooster> Apparently it's easy
[9:20] <vurtual> also Visiiri http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyYZUhSeRYc
[9:20] <Keiya> Everything else is 1 unit = .75 inches
[9:20] <Rooster> I fear how hard C++ is
[9:20] <Yourself> the game engine itself doesn't really do anything in any measurement system other than its own
[9:20] <Keiya> Yourself: Well, true. It's more that their map editor is inflexable at display
[9:20] <Visiiri> vurtual: Unfortunately, 'ignorance is bliss' doesn't apply when innocent people are dying.
[9:21] <Visiiri> Please, quit the dumbassery.
[9:21] <vurtual> Don't bring everybody down.
[9:21] <Yourself> in what way?
[9:21] <Yourself> hammer's grid locks on powers of 2
[9:21] <vurtual> Seven people got shot already. if you want to try to stop all this war, let's hear your magical plan of peace.
[9:21] <Visiiri> Rooster: AutoHotKey
[9:21] <Keiya> Yourself: Hammer uses 'engine units' only
[9:21] <Rooster> Wut
[9:21] <Keiya> You can't set it to just display in a real measurement system
[9:21] <Yourself> yeah, that's why i'm confused
[9:22] <Rooster> Visiiri I don't get it
[9:22] <Keiya> (Which while it could be different per game, is easily enough configurable)
[9:22] <Visiiri> vurtual: I don't give a damn about the war.
[9:22] <Yourself> why would you want a real measurement system? it's not really CAD software
[9:22] <Visiiri> vurtual: I give a damn about the innocent people getting shot.
[9:22] <Visiiri> vurtual: Unfortunately, violence IS the only way to peace.
[9:22] <vurtual> okay, what's your plan for stopping this?
[9:22] <Yourself> and it is different per game
[9:22] <Visiiri> Maybe shoot the actual bad guys?

[10:04] <Visiiri> I tried adding my autoclicker to my aut typer
[10:04] <Bodie> with my jillions of dollars
[10:04] <Bodie> :(
[10:04] <Bodie> sif
[10:04] <Bodie> i have like
[10:04] <Bodie> 25 dollars
[10:04] <Visiiri> And it would type 'click' whenever you clicked
[10:04] <Bodie> thats it
[10:04] <Marach-17> save
[10:04] <Bodie> but its out next week
[10:04] <Visiiri> Not only that, I couldn't stop clicking.
[10:04] <Visiiri> So... it wont work.
[10:04] <Bodie> i'm trying to sell my drum kit
[10:04] <Marach-17> so? games don't age
[10:04] <Bodie> but i wont be all cool and playing it the first day
[10:04] <Bodie> its so exciting having a game the first day
[10:04] <Marach-17> who cares
[10:04] <Marach-17> ...
[10:05] <Bodie> i'm not saying its a requirement, but its nice
[10:05] <wry> the only thing that changes is that it doesn't cost as much
[10:05] <Bodie> i wanna cap some cowboys
[10:05] <Bodie> i'll sit there in my underwear and cowboy boots, playing it
[10:05] <Bodie> for the price my cowboy boots cost, i could buy a 360 and red dead :(
[10:05] * EmpiresBane is back (gone 00:21:44)
[10:06] * leaper (Mibbit@S010600179a22b8e7.cg.shawcable.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[10:06] <Marach-17> stop making 360 look like there are any games for it
[10:06] <Bodie> just as many games as any other poopy console
[10:06] <Bodie> other than little big planet
[10:06] <Bodie> thats awesome
[10:06] <Bodie> and for ps3
[10:06] <Marach-17> none i'd like, probably
[10:06] <Marach-17> same with ps3 :/
[10:06] <Bodie> i just enjoy the casual gaming
[10:06] <wry> consoles are dead to me
[10:06] <Bodie> i used to play gta4 online all the time
[10:07] <Bodie> on 360
[10:07] <vurtual> if you haven't seen this yet, you should have: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiCm9FYZhBA
[10:07] <Bodie> but then i got banned
[10:07] <Bodie> for pirating
[10:07] <Bodie> so i sold it
[10:07] <Marach-17> lol, gta
[10:07] <Marach-17> one of the most pointless games ever made
[10:07] <Bodie> its fantastic
[10:07] <vurtual> infact watch all of it
[10:07] <vurtual> all of them
[10:07] <Marach-17> you just walk, drive and kill
[10:07] <Visiiri> Does anyone want to pretest my auto typer?
[10:08] <Marach-17> wolfenstein rpg is about the same thing
[10:08] <Bodie> ...
[10:08] <Bodie> you have missions?
[10:08] <vurtual> who cares about missions
[10:08] <Bodie> i'm just saying
[10:08] <EmpiresBane> Marach-17, gta4 is fun as long as you accept that
[10:08] <Marach-17> i don't
[10:08] <Bodie> what more do other games have?
[10:08] <Bodie> and may i remind you you're saying this in a minecraft chat
[10:08] <Bodie> minecraft is the most pointless shit ever made
[10:08] <Bodie> its still awesome
[10:08] <EmpiresBane> i mean, come on, who doesn't want to jump out of a helicopter and skydive into a steeple?
[10:09] <Marach-17> minecraft isn't pointless
[10:09] <Bodie> yes, yes it is
[10:09] <Bodie> you just walk jump and build
[10:09] <Bodie> for now anyway
[10:09] <Marach-17> it's like saying an empty sheet of paper and a pencil are pointless
[10:09] <Bodie> walk hit and build when its done
[10:09] <Marach-17> as opposing to tearing paper apart.
[10:10] <EmpiresBane> or jump out of your helicopter over bridge, realize your parachute isn't selected, madly mash buttons, open up the parachute, land safely, then get taken out by a car?
[10:10] <Bodie> gta4 is just as much of a game as most other games
[10:10] <Bodie> just because you can't build a giant penis out of cubes in it doesnt make it not a real game
[10:10] <mnjiman> Minecraft can be must more then it is, but yes it is just like an empty sheet of paper and a pencil, exactly like one
[10:11] <EmpiresBane> same with gta4
[10:11] <Marach-17> lol, nope
[10:11] <EmpiresBane> yeah
[10:11] <Marach-17> what do you use imagination with in it
[10:11] <EmpiresBane> if you're not retarded
[10:11] <EmpiresBane> games
[10:11] <EmpiresBane> i had a chase once
[10:11] <Marach-17> you stack dead bodies?
[10:11] <mnjiman> you can apply that generalization to everything
[10:11] <EmpiresBane> there was a guy in a helicopter
[10:11] <Bodie> gta4 is an experience game, not a creative game
[10:12] <Bodie> you enjoy the fun things you do in it
[10:12] <Bodie> as they happen
[10:12] <mnjiman> we are actually referring to the game concept, not fun and odd ways to waste your time on an overplayed game
[10:12] <EmpiresBane> then i drove a car with 3 other people in it with rpgs
[10:12] <Bodie> you dont build up to a point to appreciate what you've done
[10:12] <EmpiresBane> guess what we did?
[10:12] <mnjiman> something done by everyone else?
[10:12] <Bodie> a game is about the type of experience you get when playing it
[10:13] <Marach-17> who is more normal: someone that finds killing fun or something who doesn't
[10:13] <EmpiresBane> no. we shot at the ground throwing our car into the helicopter
[10:13] <Bodie> you play it for some form of enjoyment, and gta 4 supplies it in a different way to minecraft
[10:13] <mnjiman> agreed
[10:13] <mnjiman> but dont freaking try to compare gta4 with minecraft
[10:13] <Bodie> i dont find killing fun
[10:13] <mnjiman> thats just retarded
[10:13] <Bodie> i find killing in a game fun
[10:14] <EmpiresBane> in a game is fun
[10:14] <Naserve> I find it hilarious that someone is actually arguing that GTA4 is not fun
[10:14] <Bodie> lol i know right?
[10:14] <EmpiresBane> because i'm not actually killing
[10:14] <mnjiman> who said that?
[10:14] <Bodie> i dont think euphoria physics can possibly not be fun
[10:14] <vurtual> STATE SAVED. STATE SAVED. STATE SAVED.
[10:14] <EmpiresBane> god damnit. i can't play euphoria
[10:14] <EmpiresBane> don't mention it in my presence
[10:15] <Bodie> euphoria = gta4 physics
[10:15] <Bodie> more games need it
[10:15] <EmpiresBane> hm?
[10:15] <Bodie> it should be law
[10:15] <EmpiresBane> oh...
[10:15] <Bodie> if i was emperor of the world
[10:15] <EmpiresBane> i was talking about something else...
[10:15] <Bodie> i would make it so all games released from now on HAVE to have euphoria physics
[10:15] <Bodie> wether it be tetris or cod
[10:16] <EmpiresBane> how would tetris work?
[10:16] <Bodie> someone made a physics tetris game once
[10:16] <EmpiresBane> with a real physics engine?
[10:16] <Marach-17> forgot the name :/
[10:16] <Bodie> it was kinda crap really, but funny
[10:16] <vurtual> Move FASTER, pokey. Pokey! POKEY. POKEEY.
[10:16] <Marach-17> it was nice!
[10:16] <EmpiresBane> yeah.... tetris hell
[10:16] <Marach-17> vurtual: lol
[10:16] <Visiiri> Havoc engine on tetris ftw
[10:16] <Bodie> it kinda just collapsed after a bit
[10:17] <EmpiresBane> is there 3d tetris?
[10:17] <Marach-17> sure
[10:17] <Bodie> yeah
[10:17] <Marach-17> many
[10:17] <Marach-17> for all platforms you want
[10:17] <EmpiresBane> NES?
[10:17] <Marach-17> almost all
[10:18] <vurtual> this video has 669,966 views
[10:18] <Marach-17> vurtual: i watched them all. addicting stuff
[10:18] <Bodie> how very symmetrical of it
[10:18] <Earfolds> palindromic, not symmetrical
[10:19] <Bodie> i suppose
[10:19] <Bodie> if you want to be a technifag
[10:19] <Earfolds> It's not even rotationally symmetric though

[10:19] <Visiiri> I just released the AutoTyper, if anyone really cares.
[10:20] <Bodie> what does it even do?
[10:20] <Visiiri> :\
[10:20] <Visiiri> It types automatically
[10:20] <Bodie> types wht
[10:20] <Bodie> what
[10:20] <Visiiri> Whatever you input
[10:20] <Bodie> :\
[10:20] <Bodie> whats its use
[10:20] <Visiiri> What?
[10:21] <Bodie> why would i use it
[10:21] <Bodie> or is it just for funsies
[10:21] <Visiiri> Well, there's various uses
[10:21] <mnjiman> ?
[10:21] <Visiiri> I would use it to say the occasional "Welcome to my server!" deal.
[10:22] <Visiiri> Or "Griefers will be banned"
[10:22] <Visiiri> While I'm actually AFK.
[10:22] <Bodie> ok ok
[10:22] <mnjiman> dont people have that already..?
[10:22] <Bodie> only on non legit server software
[10:22] <Visiiri> In a server-script or server addon
[10:23] <EmpiresBane> another use is spambots
[10:24] <mnjiman> DIE!
[10:24] <Visiiri> Yes, another use is, indeed, spambots.
[10:25] <mnjiman> BURN IT
[10:25] <mnjiman> BURN IT!

[11:32] <EmpiresBane> seeing things?
[11:32] <EmpiresBane> you sure that's not lsd?
[11:32] <Visiiri> It could be
[11:32] <Visiiri> ffs
[11:33] <Visiiri> I mean, whenever I look around, I see a TimeShift timewarp shader
[11:33] <Visiiri> when I plink, I swear I'm seeing motherfucking sniper lasers shining through my window
[11:33] <Visiiri> when I try to stand, the floor falls out from below me
[11:33] <Visiiri> and these motherfucking walls are sliding around
[11:34] <EmpiresBane> lay down, and pretend you're on a teter-toter
[11:34] <Visiiri> Sometimes my keyboard tries to bite me
[11:34] <EmpiresBane> being sick amplifies the feeling
[11:34] <Visiiri> LSD isn't really like this
[11:34] <Visiiri> you don't actually feel loopy, you feel normal.
[11:35] <Visiiri> You're just seeing insane things.
[11:35] <Visiiri> As plain as you see your hands, you can see dinosaurs stoping on your house
[11:36] <EmpiresBane> do you know this from experience?
[11:36] <Visiiri> Unfortunately, yes.
[11:36] <EmpiresBane> wait... you've been on lsd?
[11:37] <Visiiri> Not intentionally.
[11:37] <EmpiresBane> how is that possible?
[11:38] <Visiiri> Back in Australia, when I was twelve, some motherfucking asshole dropped 200 ccs of LSD into our chimeny
[11:38] <Visiiri> :\
[11:38] <Visiiri> Of course, my rents were in brisbane on a business trip
[11:38] <Visiiri> and I get fires all the time.
[11:38] <Visiiri> I pass out and wake up in a hospital, lsd'd to shit
[11:40] <Visiiri> Indirect smoking ftl
[11:41] <EmpiresBane> once i did some triple-c after i had been up for 3 days straight
[11:41] <Visiiri> Do you know how weird it is to be a twelve year old tied down to a bed with bright lights all over you hearing unknown people talk Autotuned while motherfucking ants crawl all over you.
[11:41] <EmpiresBane> ...bad idea
[11:41] <Visiiri> hahaha
[11:42] <Marach-17> ok, got transmission received
[11:42] <Marach-17> camera shy time
[11:42] <EmpiresBane> when you're that tired. it's hard to tell what's real and what's not
[11:42] <Visiiri> Not real ants
[11:42] <Visiiri> ^
[11:42] <Visiiri> quite true
[11:42] <EmpiresBane> then you've got drugs fucking you up
[11:42] <Visiiri> I've only gone four days without sleep before
[11:43] <EmpiresBane> i "blinked" and had the weirdest experience ever
[11:43] <EmpiresBane> i actually fell asleep and started sleep-walking
[11:43] <Marach-17> seriously, who normal does drugs
[11:43] <EmpiresBane> what?
[11:44] <EmpiresBane> and of course, my friends, after realizing what was going on, decided to fuck with me while i was blundering around the house

[12:04] <Dommys> Thanks!

[12:19] <Dommys> Because I spent way to much money on one of their mice, only to have the laser camera get all wonky within a month of normal (for me) use

[12:20] <Hunter712> I have the Lachesis, 4000 DPI

[12:20] <Hunter712> And I use mine at 800 DPI
[12:20] <liq3> I haven't played SC2 since I RMA'd my Mamba.
[12:20] <Shadaez> I want a 2000 + dpi mouse
[12:20] <liq3> Shadaez: get a Razer Mamba. :D
[12:21] <Rils> this 3.4" floppy is the shit, you guys seen this?
[12:21] <Shadaez> is it bluetooth or some proprietary wireless?
[12:21] <Rils> It holds like, 3 documents!
[12:21] <Hunter712> Lachesis is one of the most bad-ass mice ever, though the design takes awhile to get used to
[12:21] <Dommys> My Sidewinder does up to 2k, and that's enough :D
[12:21] <liq3> No, just normal wireless. It has tech in it to stop interference though.
[12:21] <liq3> It auto-switches channels or something.
[12:22] <liq3> also the reciever is a "dock" (the charger) which you keep about a foot or 2 away. :P
[12:22] <Shadaez> i can't stand wired mouses
[12:22] <Dommys> I can't stand wireless :D

[12:22] <liq3> I have a Mamba, and the wireless is just as good (well, better ddue to no cable) then it's wired mode.
[12:22] <Dommys> Replacing batteries is annoying and gets expensive since, Lith rechargables suck ass.. and docks piss me off, since I use my PC so much I tend to decimate batteries.
[12:23] <liq3> It's so nice not having a cable get in the way. <3
[12:23] <Shadaez> i get probably a week on mine, not that bad

[12:28] <liq3> of the Mamba's battery. Takes about 4 to charge it up.

[12:29] <Marach-17> it dosen't even belong there
[12:29] <Marach-17> doesn't*
[12:29] <Shadaez> you might die once
[12:29] <liq3> If the battery DOES die mid gaming, you just plug the cable into the mouse.
[12:29] <liq3> it also warns you 5 minutes before the battery dies. :/
[12:29] <Marach-17> cable?
[12:29] <Konogan> Shadaez, it sucks when you got to go to the store buy some batteries mid-gaming.
[12:29] <Marach-17> what cable
[12:29] <liq3> Marach-17: Yes. Razer Mamba. Wireless/wired mouse.
[12:30] <Konogan> Sometime it happens.
[12:30] <liq3> It can both, cause it's awesome like that.

[12:33] <Dommys> No, order in advance. :D
[12:33] <liq3> Konogan: no, you buy a mamba and use the cable while waiting.
[12:33] <Shadaez> is that what you do when you run out of food, Konogan

[12:42] <Icenisse> making advanced stuff into binary?
[12:42] <Konogan> Azathoth, that reminds me of me when I randomly happen to read stuff about timespace on wikipedia.
[12:42] <Azathoth> basically it takes a huge collection of polygons (like a half-life map) and splits them up into a bunch of smaller convex groups

[13:31] <Marach-17> why would you want to
[13:31] <FalleM> Why would I not want to?
[13:31] <Speljohan_> we used it last night Konogan
[13:31] <Speljohan_> for gaming
[13:31] <Speljohan_> etc
[13:31] <Marach-17> because it produces ugly artifacts?
[13:31] <Konogan> FalleM, you open the jar and try to modify the code until it works.
[13:31] <Speljohan_> rofl
[13:31] <FalleM> That sounds
[13:31] <FalleM> Horrible
[13:31] <Marach-17> the rendering distance limit is still there
[13:31] <Speljohan_> download the jar and have fun http://www.cs.ioc.ee/~ando/jbe/
[13:32] <Marach-17> everything behind it isn't rendered
[13:32] <FalleM> Oh, really?
[13:32] <Marach-17> fog hides that
[13:32] <FalleM> Hmm
[13:32] <FalleM> Well then.
[13:32] <FalleM> Probably not a good idea.
[13:32] <Konogan> Horrible? More like Fun-but-obviously-dangerous-for-the-well-being-of-the-jar-itself.
[13:32] <Marach-17> that's why bigger fog makes the game faster. less blocks are rendered

[13:33] <Speljohan_> they fucking closed my youtube account
[13:33] <Dommys> Why is it that when I read this.. All I can think of is Jar Ass videos..
[13:33] <Konogan> Why?
[13:33] <FalleM> But I thought there were some way to render everything. That is, if your computer is up for it...
[13:33] <Speljohan_> because i had copyrighted music videos uploaded Konogan
[13:33] <Konogan> Lol.
[13:34] <Speljohan_> that must be the first time they dont just warn you
[13:34] <Marach-17> pwnt
[13:34] <Marach-17> that's why you don't use youtube for music
[13:34] <Speljohan_> i have 2 accs
[13:34] <Speljohan_> so it's no prob
[13:34] <Speljohan_> l0l
[13:34] <Marach-17> and use grooveshark instead
[13:34] <Dommys> Grooveshark does the same :D
[13:34] <Dommys> My account says so.
[13:34] <Marach-17> not for me
[13:34] <Speljohan_> wiat wat
[13:34] <Konogan> Yeah, just like 2 seceonds of random music at the end and say it's a remix.
[13:34] <Speljohan_> they ip banned me from youtube account
[13:34] <Speljohan_> wtf
[13:34] <Dommys> That's because you only upload garbage that even the artists could give a shit about.
[13:35] <Konogan> add*
[13:35] <Speljohan_> fucking lold
[13:35] <Marach-17> doblpwnt
[13:35] <Marach-17> Dommys: that didn't happen to me... probably because i'm vip
[13:35] <Dommys> I don't believe your VIP means shit if they get a DMCA C&D
[13:36] <Konogan> "Dude, that's copyright infringment" "No listen 'till the end, it's a remix!" "Eh, well."
[13:36] <Dommys> Your 3 bucks doesn't do much vs RIAA lawsuits etc
[13:36] <Speljohan_> remix assumes the person has the original tho
[13:36] <Speljohan_> remixes should be just as illegal
[13:36] <Marach-17> i'm not saying they wouldn't remove the material, only that they wouldn't remove uploading right
[13:36] <Marach-17> s*
[13:36] <Dommys> Well, that's speculative.

[13:43] <Marach-17> improved
[13:43] <Dommys> I will restate my issue with Grooveshark. I have the music I most commonly listen to on my LOCAL HARD DRIVE. I had to UPLOAD IT to grooveshark, just for grooveshark to stream it back to me +ads.
[13:43] <Marach-17> Dommys: see, my hd is too small for music
[13:43] <Marach-17> and i have no ads.

[13:47] <Speljohan_> lolll
[13:47] <Roadcrosser> some Darwyn guy I wanted to stop following on twitter said "Very shocked to hear that NBC is canceling Heroes. If they're smart NBC will turn it into a movie franchise & give it the budget it deserves"

[13:48] <Shadaez> heroes was terrible after the ast seaso
[13:48] <Shadaez> first*
[13:48] <Konogan> Spel, what about... Star Trek: Enterprise?
[13:48] <Dommys> Heroes got off on the wrong foot.
[13:48] <Marach-17> i'm still waiting for 2nd season to be aired
[13:49] <Speljohan_> Konogan, it was half-good half-bad
[13:49] <Speljohan_> already seen it all
[13:49] <Konogan> I liked it a lot :>
[13:49] <Speljohan_> it was cool to see something that early
[13:49] <Speljohan_> and how different it was
[13:49] <Speljohan_> but the last episode sucked ass
[13:49] <Dommys> The main problem with Heroes, is that Sylar is a Mary Sue..
[13:49] <Dommys> No matter WHAT the situation, Sylar can and will have the power to do whatever the story requires. (for the most part)
[13:49] <Speljohan_> Konogan, however you know that blue fag?
[13:50] <Speljohan_> forgot his name
[13:50] <Speljohan_> da andorrian leader

[14:52] <Speljohan_> the 3d space is "infinite" by default in opengl Azathoth
[14:52] <Azathoth> oh
[14:52] <Azathoth> right

[14:52] <Speljohan_> would be cool to have something like
[14:52] <Speljohan_> if you walk to a point
[14:52] <Azathoth> so you're not using a 2 dimensional array to store the map info?
[14:53] <Speljohan_> and there's a path into the 3d space
[14:53] <Speljohan_> flip camera
[14:53] <Speljohan_> to follow that path
[14:53] <Speljohan_> would be a cool thing to add tbh
[14:53] <Speljohan_> Azathoth no
[14:53] <Speljohan_> all it stores is block x,y,z, block type
[14:53] <Speljohan_> that's it

[14:54] <Azathoth> do you store all the blocks in some kind of list?
[14:55] <Ciao> How big is the minecraft map now, and how big is indev?
[14:55] <Marach-17> wut?
[14:55] <Azathoth> seems like iterating through the entire loop for collision detection would start to get really expensive

[14:56] <Speljohan_> it's AABB collision detection Azathoth, it isn't very expensive at all
[14:56] <Speljohan_> and if needed i could always optimize and only make it check for collisions near mobs
[14:56] <Speljohan_> something which is easily achieved
[14:57] <Speljohan_> just add an interface Collidable
[14:57] <Azathoth> but once you start getting really big maps, you'll have millions of blocks :O
[14:57] <Ciao> How big is the minecraft map now, and how big is indev?
[14:57] <Azathoth> i don't know what you even mean
[14:57] <Speljohan_> Azathoth, i just add Collidable interface to mobs
[14:57] <Azathoth> (to ciao)
[14:57] <Speljohan_> and during collision check
[14:57] <Ciao> like in size
[14:57] <Ciao> block size
[14:57] <Speljohan_> if it implements Collidable do check
[14:57] <Speljohan_> else, ignore it
[14:57] <Azathoth> there isn't just one minecraft map?

[14:58] <Speljohan_> brb
[14:58] <Ciao> kk
[14:58] <Azathoth> infdev is 8x the surface area of the earth and that's all anyone really knows
[14:59] <Azathoth> and it's 256 deep i think
[14:59] <Ciao> and how big is that :P?
[14:59] <Ciao> 8x the surface area of the world
[14:59] <Ciao> how much in blocks
[14:59] <Azathoth> i don't know
[14:59] <Azathoth> a fucking bajillion
[14:59] <Ciao> can it even run smoothly :S?
[15:00] <Azathoth> it's not all loaded at once

[16:19] <Speljohan_> from mainstream to the most underground unknown band
[16:19] <PuyoDead> It used to be all videos. Y'know, the things they don't play anymore.
[16:19] <Speljohan_> like a music channel should be
[16:19] <Speljohan_> diversity.

[16:20] <Speljohan_> they only played metal covers of popular stuff
[16:20] <PuyoDead> Then they made MTV2, which was all videos. Then that went to shit, too.

[16:28] <Konogan> Bildramer, you didn't for me.
[16:28] <thechris> it seems werid that the N64 is bettween the PS3 and xbox 360....
[16:28] <Speljohan_> om nom n64
[16:28] <Speljohan_> speaking of n64
[16:28] <Speljohan_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOtvenkjq54 for some reason this riff reminds me of turok 1 for n64
[16:28] <Speljohan_> it really has that turok dark mysterious feeling over it
[16:28] <bildramer> hai
[16:28] <thechris> and i play the N64 more then the PS3 XD
[16:28] <Speljohan_> thechris you played turok?
[16:29] <thechris> not the old one
[16:29] <Speljohan_> :/
[16:29] <Speljohan_> the new one sucks
[16:29] <Konogan> I played 1 and 2 :D
[16:29] <thechris> i got the new one for xbox 360 tho
[16:29] <Speljohan_> the original for n64 was epic

[16:29] <Speljohan_> i want to make sure it is just not me
[16:29] <eritz> but then, most things on the N64 were
[16:29] <Speljohan_> that hears the turok feeling
[16:29] <Speljohan_> in that riff
[16:29] <Konogan> The first one?
[16:29] <Speljohan_> yeah
[16:29] <Speljohan_> turok 1
[16:29] <Konogan> Indeed.
[16:29] <PuyoDead> My list: http://gbatemp.net/index.php?showtopic=199344&st=45&p=2511419&#entry2511419
[16:29] <Speljohan_> does the riff remind you of turok 1 Konogan ?
[16:30] <Konogan> Oh yeah, forgot about Gameboy and PSP. :P
[16:30] <Konogan> Yes Spel.
[16:30] <Speljohan_> cool
[16:30] <Speljohan_> then it wasn't just in my mind
[16:30] <Speljohan_> :)
[16:30] <thechris> NOOOOOOO
[16:30] <thechris> my DiRT disk doesnt work D:
[16:30] <thechris> i reinstalled it 3 times
[16:30] <Speljohan_> it reminds me of running around in the underground level Konogan
[16:30] <thechris> still doesnt work
[16:30] <Speljohan_> iirc world 3
[16:30] <Konogan> The name tells you why.
[16:31] <eritz> that'll teach you to legitimately buy games
[16:31] <Speljohan_> seriously, turok 1 was scary shit
[16:31] <Speljohan_> really scary game
[16:31] <Konogan> freaking dinosaurs.
[16:31] <Speljohan_> small narrow passages, very short los
[16:31] <thechris> eritz its a legit game
[16:31] <Speljohan_> but oh so addictive
[16:31] <thechris> i have the disk
[16:31] <eritz> i know, that was my point
[16:31] <thechris> OHH
[16:31] <thechris> fail...
[16:31] <Speljohan_> i have turok 2 on n64, the black cartridge
[16:31] <Speljohan_> :D
[16:31] <Konogan> :>
[16:32] <Konogan> Lost a lot of game for my N64... I only have shity game left :P
[16:32] <Speljohan_> haha
[16:32] <thechris> wait, it might be that i left while it was installing and not sure if my computer took a nap while it was installing
[16:32] <Speljohan_> still got my beloved banjo kazooie
[16:32] <Konogan> Still got Goldeneye though.
[16:32] <thechris> thats the only game i have for N64
[16:33] <Speljohan_> banjo kazooie, mario 64 and donkey kong were the best platformers
[16:33] <Speljohan_> no doubt
[16:33] <Konogan> And SSB
[16:33] <PuyoDead> Still got both Zeldas for mine.
[16:33] <Speljohan_> possibly the best 3d platformers ever made
[16:33] <Konogan> And Zedla.
[16:33] <Speljohan_> yeah
[16:33] <Konogan> Yeah, I still have the good ones though.
[16:33] <thechris> time to go to a garage sale and buy 50 N64 games for a few bucks....
[16:33] <Konogan> I only miss my good ol' Coker.
[16:33] <Konogan> Conker*
[16:34] <Speljohan_> conker was fun
[16:34] <PuyoDead> Strange thing, SNES was the only system to have 1 Zelda game.
[16:34] <Speljohan_> but i preferred banjo kazooie
[16:34] <Speljohan_> lol
[16:34] <quaxar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCEQZ_4V7NY
[16:34] <quaxar> whats with all this hype for PORTAL

[16:34] <bildramer> http://web.archive.org/web/20080730055548/http://www.fucknorrisfacts.com/
[16:34] <Speljohan_> but it was the best zelda game ever PuyoDead
[16:34] <bildramer> lololol
[16:34] <PuyoDead> It was a damn fine one.
[16:34] <Konogan> Yup.
[16:34] <Konogan> I got it.
[16:34] <quaxar> I thought the best zelda game was Zelda:Gannon wins
[16:34] <Konogan> :D
[16:34] <Speljohan_> the only 2d zelda game that got near was minish cap
[16:34] <bildramer> oh, steam for mac sucks?
[16:35] <quaxar> bildramer no
[16:35] <Speljohan_> minish cap reminded me so much of a link to the past

[16:35] <Speljohan_> yeah
[16:35] <Speljohan_> i truly enjoyed it
[16:35] <PuyoDead> So were the Oracle games.
[16:35] <Speljohan_> first zelda game i completely finish since ocarina of time
[16:36] <Naserve> Infdev needs working water!
[16:38] <Konogan> Also, Oracle of time and Oracle of season was nice!
[16:39] <Speljohan_> i never bothered with them
[16:39] <PuyoDead> They're really good.
[16:39] <Speljohan_> Konogan, come join aoe1 game
[16:39] <Speljohan_> :D
[16:39] <Konogan> Also, the one on gameboy... can't remember the name...
[16:39] <PuyoDead> Link's Awakening.
[16:39] <Speljohan_> link's awakening
[16:40] <PuyoDead> Which the Oracle games are like, just expanded.
[16:40] <Konogan> Yup.
[16:40] <Konogan> They're awesome
[16:40] <Marach-17> got NEAR?

[16:50] <thechris> i never see notch anymore D:
[16:50] <Marach-17> play minecraft
[16:51] <Konogan> I know. After he announced inviting people for MP over IRC he never came XD.
[16:51] <eritz> i'd love it if he'd add some way to make the game start in fullscreen by default
[16:51] <thechris> NEVER MUAHAHHAHA
[16:51] <Marach-17> only thing i want in minecraft are built-in hacks and more blocks (or hue slider)
[16:51] <thechris> what sucks for me cause its 10pm were he lives when i get home on weekdays
[16:51] <Marach-17> and basic scripting so i can make full games.
[16:52] <thechris> like what kinda scripting?
[16:52] <eritz> so, windows is certainly getting a client eventually, mac probably also is, but will linux?
[16:52] <Marach-17> eritz: it's java
[16:53] <Konogan> linux too. I don't see any reason why not.
[16:53] <eritz> even though it's java, clients are still an eventuality
[16:53] <Konogan> Anyway, back to Medieval II.
[16:53] <Marach-17> nope
[16:53] <eritz> it's not going to stay browser-based forever
[16:54] <thechris> it might
[16:54] <Marach-17> so?
[16:54] <eritz> no, it won't
[16:54] <Marach-17> it will still be in java
[16:54] <thechris> it could
[16:54] <Marach-17> what's the difference
[16:54] <eritz> if there is no need for a client, why is there WoM?
[16:54] <thechris> just sayin it COULD stay browser based
[16:54] <Marach-17> because notch didn't implement hacks himself YET
[16:54] <thechris> im off to food
[16:54] <thechris> peace
[16:55] <eritz> that's not the only thing WoM is for

[16:55] <Marach-17> notch will make an external client
[16:55] <eritz> yes, i'm sure he will
[16:55] <Marach-17> he said that.
[16:55] <eritz> i know he did
[16:56] <eritz> but a 'client' wouldn't be entirely platform-independent, would it?
[16:56] <Marach-17> why?
[16:56] <Marach-17> server is external already
[16:57] <eritz> no, i mean, wouldn't a client software be for windows, or linux, or mac, specifically, and not for all three at the same time?
[16:57] <Marach-17> why?
[16:57] <eritz> you're going to have to clarify that 'why', i have no idea what you mean
[16:58] <Marach-17> there's no reason behind breaking platform-independency in java.
[17:00] <eritz> doesn't there need to be a seperate mac version, with a different key-binding for placing blocks? ;)
[17:00] <Marach-17> player can set the keys himself already

[17:28] <quaxar> nope
[17:28] <quaxar> Its not
[17:28] <Konogan> Yes it is.
[17:28] <quaxar> There are infinite
[17:28] <quaxar> buttons
[17:28] <Konogan> As it doesn't have infinite surface.
[17:29] <Marach-17> who are you talking to
[17:29] <Konogan> How can it have an infinite amount of button.
[17:29] <Konogan> quaxar.
[17:30] <Konogan> Your statement miss logic.
[17:30] <quaxar> You simpley have infinite amount of buttoon
[17:30] <quaxar> there is no flaw in logic
[17:30] <Marach-17> who?
[17:30] <Konogan> There is aflaw indeed.
[17:30] <Konogan> It can't have infinite button.
[17:31] <Konogan> As the mouse itself occupies a finite space.
[17:31] <quaxar> amous occupies infinite space
[17:31] <Konogan> Your logic is fallacious quaxar.
[17:32] <quaxar> My logic is solid
[17:32] <quaxar> and heart touching
[17:32] <Konogan> It's totally incoherent.
[17:32] <Konogan> And lol, Asus.

[17:34] <Konogan> How?
[17:34] <Konogan> It just can't.
[17:34] <quaxar> By having a button that says "infinity" on it
[17:34] <quaxar> like comcasts infinite service police
[17:34] <quaxar> wich was actually not infinite
[17:35] <quaxar> and they charged people for going over their limit
[17:35] <Konogan> It's not infinite trhen.
[17:35] <Konogan> then*
[17:35] <quaxar> oh, its still infinite
[17:35] <Marach-17> infinite != free
[17:35] <quaxar> Infinite is a trademarked term
[17:35] <Konogan> So stop saying it have infinite buttons, if it only gots "an infinite button".
[17:35] <Konogan> There's a big difference.
[17:36] <quaxar> I never said buttons once

[17:58] <bildramer> "I had a teacher in seventh grade who told us that a short story was called an "antidote." One of my classmates tried to correct her, but she refused to believe him, so he picked up a dictionary and proved her wrong. She still wouldn't believe him and told him that it's probably pronounced "antidote." When he told her that it's "anecdote," she retorted, "I went to college. I have a college degree, so you can't question me." To this day
[17:58] <Slothic> this is where you say FOOTBALL :p
[17:59] <bildramer> I fucking hate this kind of people.

[18:00] <ottottott> Is Notch dead?

[18:01] <Konogan> Sounds like that teacher was only messing around with the guy.
[18:01] <Cue> Any Polish speakers here?
[18:01] <Cue> :<
[18:01] <Slothic> otto just cause he doesn't post everyday doesn't mean hes dead.
[18:01] <Slothic> hes been working for a whole year, i doubt that a few days without updates will kill us
[18:01] <Slothic> :b
[18:01] <ottottott> well he hasn't posted in a week...
[18:02] <Slothic> so?
[18:02] <ottottott> he used to be more active piosting updates or something...
[18:02] <Konogan> Slothic, that doesn't cure my update withdrawal syndrome.
[18:02] <Slothic> he doesn't have to post, he does it to keep us informed. so be thankfull you get some.
[18:02] <gdude2002> ottottott: Could you keep up with it?
[18:02] <Slothic> :b
[18:02] <gdude2002> Do you think you'd be able to make Miecraft better than he does?

[18:05] <Dommys> Or, atleast, give him a valid arguement
[18:05] <ottottott> use an airfreshener...

[18:06] <Konogan> Tell him something like "What did you expect, you just entered the room."
[18:06] <ottottott> :b

[18:57] <Ten_Tacles> All my military dwarves don't train
[18:57] <Konogan> 40d = easier fortress.
[18:57] <blaster> How do I attract more goblins
[18:57] <Ten_Tacles> Even if I tell them to
[18:57] <Konogan> 2010 = easier adventurer.
[18:57] <Ten_Tacles> They throw away their weapons and ran into the goblins.
[18:57] <blaster> TenTacles thats a glitch with 2010
[18:57] <Ten_Tacles> I know
[18:57] <blaster> If they do train then they will never stop
[18:57] <Ten_Tacles> And that nofish is annyoing too
[18:57] <Ten_Tacles> They never started
[18:58] <Ten_Tacles> That is so annyoing.

[18:58] <blaster> Instead of changing their station in the hope that they will catch whatever
[18:58] <thechris> im off to kill robloxers

[19:06] <Kodaichi> that would be messed

[19:07] <blaster> Ten_tackels attach the piller to a lever
[19:07] <Kodaichi> imagine if everyone looked the same ._.

[22:28] <Marach-17> or both
[22:29] <thechris> shouldnt steam be cheaper?
[22:29] <Marach-17> CruelNoise: not here, anyway

[22:29] <CruelNoise> that's why i'm not buying it physically
[22:30] <CruelNoise> well, AndrewPH, no packaging
[22:30] <thechris> just sayin it should be cheaper because they have much less costs them physically making the disk
[22:30] <thechris> and shiping
[22:30] <CruelNoise> but i guess they have to have heavy load servers
[22:30] <thechris> and the disk itslef
[22:30] <AndrewPH> they have to pay for their servres
[22:30] <AndrewPH> servers
[22:30] <AndrewPH> they aren't cheap man
[22:30] <thechris> itself*
[22:30] <CruelNoise> that's what i just said

[22:30] <AndrewPH> was talking to chris
[22:30] * Kokopure is now known as Koko|MW2

[22:30] <AndrewPH> a few bucks to make
[22:31] <thechris> for every single copy sold
[22:31] <CruelNoise> actually, that cheap plastic is probably only a few cents
[22:31] <AndrewPH> the cd costs a little though\
[22:31] <EmpiresBane> also, imagine how much people would complain about it being cheaper online then in stores
[22:31] <thechris> you have to figure in labor/shiping costs also, factorys arnt free either
[22:31] <CruelNoise> you can buy good CD-Rs for about ten cents each

[22:32] <CruelNoise> we're taking manufacture into account when we're talking about packaging being cheaper
[22:32] <thechris> it depends on were you live
[22:32] <Ten_Tacles> Do you think goblins breed like every other creature?
[22:32] <Ten_Tacles> Or like dorfs?

[22:45] <Marach-17> Kodaichi: nope
[22:45] <Marach-17> youtube is worse
[22:45] <Visiiri> The health teacher managed to convince them that you can get STDs though IRC.

[23:06] <blaster> Is that what you mean?
[23:06] <LG_Legacy> Lol
[23:06] <Aeomin> er.. there is no such thing as emulate..

[23:07] <Visiiri> notepad.exe
[23:07] <blaster> Yes I am having difficulty finding this through google
[23:07] <blaster> So I save notepad as a PHP?

[23:07] <Aeomin> appserv, xampp
[23:07] <Kodaichi> I could make one for myself, idk
[23:07] <Visiiri> Kodaichi: I can make one for you, however.
[23:07] <Visiiri> It will only take a moment.
[23:08] <Siiseli> someone hilited me

[23:08] <Kodaichi> alright time to get to wor
[23:08] <Kodaichi> k
[23:08] <blaster> I know, thats my problem
[23:09] <Aeomin> that's not the problem..
[23:09] <blaster> If i boot it from a .php made in notepad will the serverside things still run?
[23:09] <EmpiresBane> hey vurtual... you there?
[23:09] <Aeomin> you need to run a httpd with php support
[23:09] <bildramer> uh
[23:09] <bildramer> what

[23:12] <Visiiri> Quatroking still isn't here, and I must talk with him.
[23:12] <blaster> Woohoo more complexity
[23:13] <Aeomin> both softwares are already setup with mysql and php
[23:13] <Aeomin> you could setup everything from scratch..
[23:13] <blaster> I know
[23:13] <blaster> I seen that on the webpage
[23:13] <Visiiri> Doez tehy has HTML works?
[23:14] <Aeomin> if your browser supports it
[23:14] <blaster> If your browser does not support HTML... its most likely not a browser
[23:15] <Koko|MW2> HTML's pretty much what the internet's made of...
[23:15] <Aeomin> even Lynx supports it
[23:15] <blaster> Wait a second AppServ is telling me to enter my server information
[23:15] <blaster> Can I put in anything?
[23:15] <Aeomin> yeah...
[23:16] <Visiiri> :\ Why does nobody get my HTML jokes, ever?
[23:16] <Rithiur> Btw, I would recommend manually installing PHP, Apache and MySQL instead of using xampp or anything like that.
[23:17] <blaster> Rithiur I am not going to use my pc as a server
[23:17] <Aeomin> well, for beginner, don't push too hard
[23:17] <blaster> It will be temporary
[23:18] <blaster> Ok now what? Some cmd window appeared and then disapeared after the install
[23:18] <Aeomin> goto http://127.0.0.1
[23:18] <blaster> That will be an invalid request
[23:19] <Aeomin> er...
[23:19] <blaster> I think the server crashed or something
[23:19] <Aeomin> Haven't use appserv for 3 years..
[23:19] <Aeomin> is there any icon in taskbar?
[23:20] <blaster> Ok as soon as it boots the computer makes a BOOOOP and then the server crashes
[23:20] <Aeomin> check apache log

[23:20] <Marach-17> i use wamp. never had a single issue

[23:23] <Marach-17> wamp? easy? lol
[23:23] <Rithiur> Installing Apache, MySQL and PHP is much easier than people generally think. It's running two installers, unpacking the PHP to a directory and editing couple config files (which is all documented properly in installation instructions).
[23:23] <Marach-17> you just install and press the button
[23:23] <blaster> Thanks for that Marach
[23:23] <Marach-17> and it's running
[23:23] <thechris> hey everyone
[23:23] <thechris> blaster, how is the mountain maker thing coming along?
[23:23] <Aeomin> how about nanoweb, a httpd using PHP..lol

[23:39] <blaster> Yes, but how do I open a php file to see what it would look like without having to run a server?
[23:39] <Aeomin> with browser?
[23:39] <blaster> That does nothing
[23:39] <Rithiur> You can't see the output in browser without running a server yourself.
[23:39] <Aeomin> you need have apache or something running

[23:54] <Snowman> HARD SONG IS HARD
[23:54] <thechris> probobaly the stuff on the snow
[23:54] <vurtual> Even my mom has one.
[23:55] <vede> That's probably burning a mixture of the crap that's all over the snow, and the thin layer of stuff that's on the pan left over from washing.
[23:55] <vurtual> I tried to tell her something about tesla coils and she apparently "misheard" me.

[23:56] <vurtual> Anyways, the reason was, install some tesla coils somewhere, and play music on them.
