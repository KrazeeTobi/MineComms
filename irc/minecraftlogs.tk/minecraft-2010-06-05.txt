[6:24] <wry> yes
[6:25] <GrammarNazi> If you buy one do you get both infdev and indev? What's the difference between the two?
[6:25] <eZek0> infdev is more infinite.
[6:25] <Malikat> minecraft is, as you should know, an alpha

[6:30] * Vgor (Clay@pool-96-255-204-117.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has left #minecraft
[6:30] <GrammarNazi> So this is like
[6:31] <GrammarNazi> A sandbox game, correct?
[6:31] <eZek0> Why are you thinking of buying it without trying it at all?
[6:31] <wry> my face is a sand box
[6:31] <Malikat> GrammarNazi: right now, only creative has multiplayer
[6:31] <Malikat> thus you only have sandbox mode
[6:32] <Malikat> indev and infdev are early releases of the survival mode, where you have limited resources and need to make and use tools to succeed at things
[6:32] <Malikat> and also not get your ass killed by monsters
[6:32] <Malikat> survival will have multiplayer, soon, where you work together to accomplish those goals... or work against each other
[6:32] <eZek0> You can register to the site and play Creative mode for free.
[6:32] <Malikat> at least, i hope you'll be able to work against each other. i hope PVP is as simple as running up and hitting someone
[6:33] <Malikat> yeah, if you make an account - which is free - you can play creative online or alone
[6:33] <eZek0> As well as an old version of Survival.
[6:33] <GrammarNazi> But Survival is only for those who buy, eh?
[6:33] <eZek0> Which is kinda poopy.
[6:33] <eZek0> Indev is a more recent version of survival, with added crafting and items etc.
[6:33] <Malikat> eventually, creative will only be for those who buy, too
[6:33] <Malikat> it's not a free game
[6:33] <eZek0> Eventually the game will be paid only.
[6:33] <Malikat> it's only free because it's an alpha
[6:34] <Malikat> eventually it will be a finished game, and there will be a free demo
[6:34] <eZek0> Right now the price is half off what it will be at release-- once the game hits beta, which will be soon... the price will go up.

[6:48] <Visiiri> As was annihilator_beta
[6:48] <eZek0> Go find them.

[6:49] <Visiiri> Yup
[6:49] * Darkebrz hugs Visiiri
[6:50] <eZek0> How?
[6:50] <Visiiri> I remember those ages ago
[6:50] <Visiiri> before he had his lava server coded
[6:50] <Visiiri> and it was actually a vanilla server
[6:50] <Darkebrz> TheOne's lava server is custom now?
[6:50] <Visiiri> Hugely custom
[6:50] <Darkebrz> D:
[6:50] <Visiiri> it resets maps and stuff
[6:50] <Darkebrz> I remember when there were like
[6:50] <Darkebrz> 10 maps
[6:50] <Visiiri> Yeah...
[6:50] <Visiiri> And then there was that server that I can't remember the name of
[6:50] <LuciferZ> HEY DUDES AND LADIES
[6:51] <Visiiri> where Eagle invited us
[6:51] <AndrewPH> Visiiri, it's just cmss I believe
[6:51] <Visiiri> cmss? no sir.
[6:51] <Visiiri> Well, I guess it's possible.

[6:53] <Visiiri> ....I fell in it twice because of how epic his server was.

[7:39] <Azathoth> Malikat, halp D:
[7:40] <Azathoth> i've got like 3 aliens trapped in a multi-story UFO. what do the purple tiles with red circles on them mean?
[7:40] <rob`> the teleporters?
[7:40] <rob`> press the person-up button on the toolbar
[7:40] <rob`> if it's what I think, it's an elevator
[7:40] <Azathoth> the teleporters are the ones iwth vertical lines right?
[7:41] <rob`> yar, you move stuff onto them and press the little person-up button
[7:41] <Azathoth> there are other purple ones though. i don't know if they're decoration or something i need to worry about
[7:41] <rob`> or down
[7:41] <Malikat> purple tiles with red circles?
[7:41] <Malikat> uh
[7:41] <rob`> without a screenshot, i dunno :)
[7:41] <Malikat> probably grav lifts
[7:41] <Azathoth> also what is it when my my dudes have magical stuff appear over them and then they panick?
[7:41] <Azathoth> panic*
[7:41] <Malikat> try using the up one level or down one level button
[7:42] <Malikat> probably a psi attack
[7:42] <Malikat> if you're fighting sectoids
[7:42] <Malikat> they're being mentally attacked
[7:42] <Azathoth> do they need line of sight for that?
[7:42] <Malikat> yeah
[7:42] <Malikat> but they tend to remember the location of panicked or mind controlled units
[7:42] <Azathoth> how are they doing it then... my guys are in a room :\
[7:42] <rob`> only the high-ranking ones can attack you like that, they're usually up in the control room, and they can do it from anywhere, they just need ONE of their guys to spot you
[7:42] <Malikat> if the unit doesn't move
[7:43] <Malikat> ^
[7:43] <Azathoth> ooh
[7:43] <Azathoth> that makes sense
[7:43] <Malikat> not really line of sight, just location
[7:43] <rob`> you can do some pretty crazy stuff when you get your own MC units
[7:43] <Azathoth> i've got 5 guys in the elevator room. one of them came down and got zapped by like 3 reaction shots
[7:43] <Malikat> haha nice
[7:43] <Malikat> i think
[7:43] <Azathoth> then two of my guys got the psi attack and they panicked
[7:43] <Malikat> >:
[7:43] <Malikat> yeah, he saw your guys when it came down
[7:44] <rob`> man, now I want to play again
[7:44] <vurtual> If I ever see a cop doing something violent, I'll set my camera to livestream, then just be there.
[7:44] <Malikat> fortunately he didn't get mind controlled
[7:44] <Azathoth> argh. he keeps fucking with those guys
[7:44] <Azathoth> so i can't move them off that spot
[7:44] <Malikat> if you get a chance, make them drop their weapons
[7:45] <vurtual> The first moment he notices me, I'll go "If you strike me down now, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.", then the moment he orders me to turn it off, I'll say "It's live, the whole world is watching this."
[7:45] <vurtual> then of course run away like mad if he charges at me, because kevlar is hard to stab through.
[7:45] <Malikat> i thought kevlar isn't very stab resistant
[7:46] <vurtual> it is when a cop is trying to beat you up.
[7:46] <Varriount> Are you guys still playing dwarf fortess?
[7:46] <vurtual> no, real life.
[7:46] <wry> vurtual: guild time?

[7:48] <Azathoth> because after the first two attacks, it shows "hidden movement" for a second and then two more happen
[7:48] <Malikat> i WISH
[7:48] <Malikat> i WISH you could open doors
[7:48] <Azathoth> it would be nice
[7:49] <Azathoth> so you don't need to run in there and waste a ton of TU and also get shot up
[7:49] <Tommerry11> what game are you talking about?
[7:49] <Malikat> X-COM
[7:49] <Azathoth> can they pick up weapons if they've gone berserk?
[7:49] <Tommerry11> ahh, cool.

[7:51] <vurtual> I think it was phiarlan

[7:51] <wry> hm
[7:51] <Azathoth> also i haven't been able to do anything with them for several turns do to panic
[7:51] * vurtual goes insane when tvtropes has no entry on M&Ms, and thusly no way to find out the voice of the red M&M guy in the M&M commercial
[7:52] <Azathoth> can i escape from their attack if i move?

[7:52] <Azathoth> oh god, everyone is going berserk
[7:52] <Azathoth> what do
[7:53] <Malikat> they just remember that you're still in that spot
[7:53] <Malikat> what

[8:12] <Malikat> keep one of everything until you have it researched
[8:12] <Azathoth> well, obviously
[8:12] <Malikat> keep power sources because they cost elerium to manufacture
[8:12] <Azathoth> but i've got extras of a lot of stuff
[8:13] <Malikat> same with navigation and ammo
[8:13] <Malikat> elerium is the most precious thing in the game

[8:34] <UncleBibby> How are we supposed to do that, besides using Omen?
[8:35] <Visiiri> AGES off
[8:35] <Jat> ok i need an explanation
[8:35] <eZek0> So like, what happens now
[8:35] <rob`> a dungeon mode will probably have to disable block creation and destruction entirely
[8:35] <Jat> why do the newer version of opengl basically remove everything useful?

[8:35] <Azathoth> when did he say he wanted people to make dungeons?
[8:35] <Visiiri> Yeah
[8:36] <Azathoth> notch gets boners for procedural generation you know

[8:36] <Visiiri> shoot off zombies at night
[8:36] <eZek0> +swords
[8:36] <UncleBibby> I think Notch should scrap the dungeon mode idea and make a platforming mode (with special blocks designed solely for platforming
[8:36] <Visiiri> platforming mode?
[8:36] <Visiiri> what
[8:37] <rob`> what's platforming?
[8:37] <eZek0> How would you have special platforming blocks?
[8:37] <eZek0> We have platforming already...
[8:37] <UncleBibby> spring blocks, moving platforms
[8:37] <eZek0> Go to any obstacle/race server
[8:37] <Aeomin> rob`, think of super mario...
[8:37] <UncleBibby> mario style jumpin and runnin blocks
[8:37] <rob`> ahh
[8:37] <Visiiri> ah
[8:37] <eZek0> He said he wasn't going to add spring blocks though.
[8:37] <UncleBibby> ya okay
[8:37] <LuciferZ> Vis, I like how your ghost just pinged out of #minecast
[8:37] <UncleBibby> but moving platform blocks would be SWEEEEET!!!!!
[8:37] <eZek0> They'd need to be an entity, not a block
[8:38] <UncleBibby> whatev, dude
[8:38] <UncleBibby> I just think that a platforming mode would be easier to program than a dungeon mode

[10:58] <wry> sad day
[10:58] <Roadcrosser> how did it go?
[10:58] <vurtual> Because, similarly, "poorness", because I was first level, third rank.
[10:58] <Roadcrosser> meh
[10:58] <vurtual> by the time I'm second level I should be able to buy plenty, though.

[10:59] <vurtual> That'll be any quest, if you can use intimidation. Is that a ranger skill?
[10:59] <vurtual> I'm just a few ranks away from second level though.
[10:59] <wry> no, it's not
[11:00] <vurtual> we could buy cheap hirelings.

[11:01] <Roadcrosser> I searched google images for penguin
[11:01] <vurtual> well would you rather hireling a fighter, or a cleric?
[11:01] <wry> cleric, i guess
[11:01] <Roadcrosser> on the 48th page the page is still swarming with penguins
[11:01] <wry> at least she heals me
[11:01] <Kodaichi> search google images for Lopunny: suddenly become furry

[11:12] <Roadcrosser> and LIVESTREAM it!
[11:12] <Roadcrosser> a portal mod
[11:12] <Roadcrosser> to see what happens when some string is being tied in a loop between 2 portals
[11:12] <eZek0> I just watched a speedrun of portal that took 13:26 :|
[11:12] <Roadcrosser> |--------|
[11:12] <Roadcrosser> like that
[11:13] <Roadcrosser> and if you close a portal
[11:13] <eZek0> snip
[11:13] <Roadcrosser> it pushes whatever back the other side
[11:13] <Roadcrosser> as says the comentary
[11:13] <eZek0> Hm.
[11:13] <Roadcrosser> since tehre isnt string in portal
[11:13] <eZek0> World asplode, or just snip.
[11:13] <Roadcrosser> we will never know
[11:13] <Roadcrosser> so LIVESTREAM
[11:13] <Roadcrosser> my guess is that since the game wasnt designed to do it
[11:13] <eZek0> Birds are chirping, it's time to go to bed.
[11:14] <Roadcrosser> the string would stick inside the wall
[11:14] <eZek0> They normally only start around 5...

[11:23] <Marach> your mom doesn't trust vis for medical information?
[11:23] <Visiiri> Well, many researches (at least when I researched this when I was twelve) pointed towards all pain being not really existing-> Just the brain interperating damaged neurons.
[11:23] <vurtual> I don't trust vis like I don't trust my mom
[11:23] <vurtual> but 100x over
[11:24] <Visiiri> However, headaches came from sensory neurons firing wrong in the head and spinal cord.
[11:24] <vurtual> because my mom at least has some experience.
[11:24] <Visiiri> Trust me.

[11:24] <Marach> but that would be just cruel, wouldn't it
[11:25] <Visiiri> I can treat everything.
[11:25] <vurtual> How do you treat shock then?
[11:25] <Visiiri> Coolllld water.
[11:25] <Visiiri> A punch in the face.
[11:25] <Visiiri> A "GET OVER IT" sticker.
[11:25] <vurtual> no, those would all hurt it.

[11:26] <Visiiri> Try it. I dare you.
[11:26] <vurtual> So you know more than the US military field medic class?
[11:26] <vurtual> People DO do that, but it just kills people
[11:26] <Visiiri> Incorrect.
[11:26] <Visiiri> That's just what they want you to think.
[11:26] <vurtual> my field experience is all lies then ok
[11:26] <Visiiri> A mental state cannot 'kill' someone.

[11:30] <vurtual> I think elevating legs was actually used in treating shock, but I should proabbly go back over that stuff.
[11:30] <wry> it is
[11:30] <Visiiri> No, you're actually correct.

[11:31] <vurtual> I did too, in a videogame.
[11:32] <wry> which vid?
[11:32] <vurtual> AA2
[11:32] <Marach> argh, i can have batteries in either mouse or wiimote
[11:32] <vurtual> Granted, there are multiple occourances where that training literally saved many lives.
[11:32] <wry> aa?
[11:32] <vurtual> Marach, Wiimote, but use it as a mouse

[11:32] <vurtual> America's Army.
[11:32] <wry> ah
[11:32] <Marach> that's still not enough
[11:32] <wry> makes sense
[11:32] <Marach> :/

[11:33] <vurtual> The training requires real life knowledge.

[11:39] <Visiiri> In theory, you can learn the methods, but I feel that it's alot safer to simply have the action stored in your cerebellum, as doing something and seeing someone do it (in this case an ANIMATED person) are completely different.

[12:20] <vede> Yeah.
[12:20] <Visiiri> hast is have

[12:23] <vede> Yeah, it's "You have me" Visiiri.

[12:24] <vede> Nope.

[12:26] <Visiiri> Not only that, but listen to their SONG
[12:26] <Visiiri> they sang it in ENGLISH
[12:26] <Visiiri> and in ENGLISH, they say HATE
[12:26] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[12:26] <Azathoth> and?
[12:26] <Ten_Tacles> I like Rammstein
[12:26] <Visiiri> vede disagreed.
[12:27] <Visiiri> Vede was wrong.
[12:27] <vede> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du_Hast
[12:27] <Azathoth> weird
[12:28] <Azathoth> hasse is hate
[12:28] <Visiiri> That's still not correct
[12:28] <Visiiri> Compare it in context to the rest of the words.
[12:28] <Visiiri> It just doesn't work
[12:28] <Azathoth> it's the same word
[12:28] <vede> Vis, just deal with it.
[12:28] <vede> ur rong
[12:28] <Azathoth> just a different conjugation
[12:29] <vede> Azathoth, no they're not.
[12:29] <Visiiri> You link to wikipedia
[12:29] <Visiiri> And yet, you've not listened to the english song.
[12:29] <Visiiri> It clearly says 'hate' and that's "hasst"
[12:29] <Azathoth> visiiri, no one disagrees that it says hate
[12:29] <Visiiri> <Visiiri> But the song lyrics are "you HATE me"
[12:29] <Visiiri> <vede> Nope.
[12:29] <Visiiri> Those are letters, no?
[12:29] <Azathoth> i think it's a problem of someone misspelling the german word
[12:30] <vede> Haben and hassen are different words. But their second-person conjugations are impossible to differentiate in speech.
[12:30] <Azathoth> but they're possible to differentiate in spelling vede
[12:30] <vede> Indeed they are.
[12:30] <Azathoth> and the translation says hate
[12:30] <Azathoth> but the spelling is hast
[12:30] <vede> Azathoth, the translation says hate, but the original is not.
[12:30] <Azathoth> it's inconsistent
[12:30] <Visiiri> Original?
[12:30] <vede> The original is "Du Hast."
[12:30] <Azathoth> so the question is..... who fucked up?
[12:31] <Visiiri> English.
[12:31] <Azathoth> why the huge difference in the lyrics
[12:31] * Parthon (cheeeese@godsta.arach.net.au) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[12:31] <vede> It's possible that no one fucked up.
[12:31] <Azathoth> they just changed it completely for no apparent reason?
[12:31] <vede> I think the song was meant to have a sort of double meaning in the first place.
[12:31] <Visiiri> Double meaning?
[12:31] <vede> But in all the lyrics and stuff, it's "hast" and not "hasst"
[12:31] <Visiiri> "in all the lyrics and stuff"
[12:32] <Azathoth> so it's a play on words based on the lack of audible difference in the words?

[12:32] <vurtual> English has lots of them, but they're all dirty.
[12:32] <Visiiri> I believe that it's obvious that it was a mistranslation.
[12:33] <Azathoth> i don't know
[12:33] <Azathoth> vede could be onto something
[12:33] <vede> They can't really do the homophone trick in the English translation.
[12:33] <vede> (Which is one of the reasons you really just shouldn't try to translate lyrics anyway.)
[12:33] <Visiiri> It's German, good sir
[12:33] <Visiiri> ^this logi
[12:33] <Visiiri> *logic
[12:33] <Azathoth> i think vede's right
[12:34] <Visiiri> Because Rammstein translated the lyrics, Rammstein probably knows what the words are.
[12:34] <Visiiri> "hate" isn't "have"
[12:34] <vurtual> why is it that wizards hve no apparent good things to train in
[12:34] <Azathoth> but visiiri, they couldn't use both words at the same time
[12:34] <Azathoth> durr
[12:34] <vurtual> but every time I level up, I get fighter stuff.
[12:34] <Visiiri> That's probably a mistranslation.
[12:34] <Azathoth> in the german version it's probably supposed to be ambiguous
[12:34] <Visiiri> :\
[12:34] <Azathoth> in the english, they had to choose the one that made the most sense
[12:35] <Visiiri> I don't think that rammstein has enough mental power to make songs with meanings
[12:35] <Azathoth> they probably don't even write their own filth
[12:35] <Visiiri> when they have gay sex on stage at their concerts.
[12:35] <Visiiri> (Not REAL, mind you.)
[12:35] <vede> Visiiri, they had to pick ONE of the possible meanings because they couldn't pull off the clever language trick in the translation, and seeing how in the original it's clearly "hast" from *everything on the internet and elsewhere about it*, it could easily be for a few reasons.
[12:36] <Azathoth> saying "you have me" a bunch in english just doesn't have the same effect
[12:36] <Visiiri> And what makes you think that it IS a clever language trick?
[12:36] <Visiiri> The meaning isn't really that clever either way.
[12:36] <vede> They might not have thought that "You have me" wouldn't be as successful to English-speaking (primarily American) audiences.
[12:36] <Visiiri> Not only that, but it's still rammstein.
[12:36] <Azathoth> they probably do not write their own lyrics
[12:36] <vurtual> You know, I almost want to play D&D with you guys irl
[12:36] <Azathoth> LETS DO IT VURTUAL
[12:36] <vurtual> see how long before someone suggests a "sundering meat" feat
[12:36] <Azathoth> you're in illinois right?
[12:37] <vede> Azathoth, according to da wiki, they do.
[12:37] <vurtual> that reduces the AC of a female's panties or something.
[12:37] <Azathoth> well
[12:37] <Visiiri> Those silly germans
[12:37] <Azathoth> it's really not that clever anyway
[12:37] <vurtual> It's like saying "coming" and then having an alternate meaning
[12:37] <vurtual> okay a bit clever
[12:37] <Azathoth> having gay stage sex doesn't mean someone doesn't think
[12:37] <Visiiri> Let's pretend that "hasst" actually says "raped my mother and made me watch and it hurt"
[12:38] <vede> And Visiiri, I think it's weird how you like Rammstein, but you seem so averse to them being anything other than a bunch of mentally deficient angry shirtless guys.

[12:39] <Dommys> Dommys only requires a minimal amount of love to function

[12:41] <Visiiri> the type of funny where you choke on your sobe
[12:41] <vede> Visiiri, in the vein of heavy metal lacking intelligence or cleverness, I'm just gonna point you in the direction of Anal Cunt. I think that's the sort of stuff you're looking for. :)
[12:41] <Visiiri> I thought that Rammstein had one clever song.
[12:41] <Azathoth> i mean..... i love vurtual
[12:41] <Visiiri> So I think that Anal Cunt is a little below.
[12:42] <vede> Anal Cunt is a little below EVERYTHING.
[12:42] <Visiiri> vurtual, you've got a pusseh! I've got a dick-ah! So what's the probliim, let's do it quick!
[12:42] <Visiiri> I just love that
[12:42] <Visiiri> because I always played Combat Arms CTF while I listened to that
[12:42] <Azathoth> anal cunt?
[12:42] <Azathoth> is that a band?
[12:42] <vede> Yes, Azathoth.
[12:42] <Visiiri> Yeah.
[12:42] <vurtual> always a band
[12:42] <Azathoth> wow.....

[12:43] <vede> Funny stuff.
[12:43] <Visiiri> Gayniggers from space is a movie, too.
[12:43] <Visiiri> That really hurt me.
[12:44] <vede> Most of their songs are just a few seconds long and consist primarily of incoherent screaming and people randomly slapping on guitars.

[23:14] <vurtual> Because some people certainly won't just go into the system like that. You'll probably bump into one or two of those people. Then that causes trouble.
[23:16] <vurtual> It's not like you can use military force against people, soldiers won't always obey, computers aren't invincible, force won't always work. You can't exactly just go poof, no more ability.
