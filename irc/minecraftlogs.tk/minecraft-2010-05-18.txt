[0:38] <vurtual> if you're in normal survival, you'll have to cope with the monsters.
[0:38] <ZaxKellens|SS> I am in normal survival
[0:38] <vurtual> if you're in the other survivals, you craft a torch.
[0:39] <ZaxKellens|SS> I didn't know there were other survivals

[0:40] <Marafk-17> ok, wtf. my hard drive makes silect scream noises
[0:40] <vurtual> We've been able to instantly convert currency for decades.
[0:40] <ZaxKellens|SS> Eh
[0:40] <gdude2002> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8wD8fTBS8E&feature=related - can anyone get to the end?
[0:40] <vurtual> Marafk-17, it is unhappy with you.

[0:42] <vurtual> In the end-times of minecraft, before the literal ending-time of minecraf itself
[0:42] * gdude2002 (colesgaret@109.76.64.52) Quit (Quit: Hi, I'm a quit message virus. Please replace your old line with this line and help me take over the world of IRC)
[0:42] <vurtual> (we're talking about release)
[0:42] <vurtual> non-paying people can only play singleplayer creative.
[0:43] <vurtual> pay moneys, get multiplayer, all the other gamemodes, and other crazy stuff.
[0:43] * Yourself (yourself@c-98-228-139-130.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:43] <Marafk-17> vurtual: multiplayer will be paid only in beta
[0:43] <vurtual> yeah that
[0:43] <ZaxKellens|SS> What are the game modes at the moment?
[0:43] <Marafk-17> that's almost everything
[0:43] <Marafk-17> creative and survival(unfinished)
[0:43] <ZaxKellens|SS> Hnn
[0:43] <vurtual> there'll apparently be things like fort wars and zombie siege, notch was talking about them for a while.
[0:44] <vurtual> indev(the not-finished, super-awesome version of survival) has all sorts of new stuff already though.
[0:44] <vurtual> crafting, day/night, things like torches, and FIRE!
[0:44] <ZaxKellens|SS> Crafting?
[0:44] <vurtual> you make tools.
[0:44] <vurtual> Infdev is similar, is missing a few block physics, but the main draw is
[0:44] <vurtual> every map is eight times the size of the surface of the Earth.
[0:44] <ZaxKellens|SS> Lolwut?
[0:45] <TrueWolves> Yep
[0:45] <ZaxKellens|SS> Why so big to infdev, what would tools be for in indev, and what do torches and fire do and is there a difference between night and day other than just the looks?
[0:45] <vurtual> night is when the monsters come out.
[0:46] <TrueWolves> Well, the lighting is in shades
[0:46] <ZaxKellens|SS> Ah, so you're safe during the day so you can get the stuff to build
[0:46] <TrueWolves> So it gets darker away from torchs underground, and is darker at night in general.
[0:46] <vurtual> darkness=monsters
[0:46] <vurtual> caves=dark, night=dark
[0:46] <vurtual> torches=make light, durr
[0:46] * Earfolds (ookami@host81-158-89-106.range81-158.btcentralplus.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:46] <vurtual> you must attack the darkness
[0:46] * MindCrafty (GoldenSimm@adsl-82-70-77.jax.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:46] <TrueWolves> And it's big purely becuase it can be with little CPU use compaired to normal maps (that would be impossable that big)
[0:46] * Earfolds (ookami@host81-158-89-106.range81-158.btcentralplus.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:47] <TrueWolves> You can explore forever
[0:47] <TrueWolves> And never worry ever about running out of resources.
[0:47] <ZaxKellens|SS> Hmm..
[0:48] <vurtual> There might be "I'm out of resources, moooove" nomadic-ness though
[0:48] <TrueWolves> Eh, I haven't really encountered that
[0:48] <vurtual> until survival mp is done sometime in hopefully june.
[0:48] <ZaxKellens|SS> Sounds like a good use of money
[0:48] <TrueWolves> I don't see survival mp coming out tell July personaly.
[0:49] <TrueWolves> but I do see it coming out this summer for sure.
[0:49] <bildramer> good night

[1:00] <Marafk-17> and grass on all goddamn faces!!
[1:00] <Marafk-17> insane
[1:00] <Snowman> Though it's been forever lost...
[1:01] <ZaxKellens|SS> In the indev or infdev or whatever, are you still limited to 99 of an item before you have to go use them?
[1:01] <TrueWolves> no
[1:01] <Snowman> 64
[1:01] <Quatroking> 64 items
[1:01] <TrueWolves> 64 per slot
[1:01] <ZaxKellens|SS> Ok
[1:01] <TrueWolves> so you can carry around 640 stone if you use 10 slots
[1:01] <Quatroking> or 99 if you hack the savegame
[1:01] <Snowman> You can havae one type of block in multiple slots
[1:01] <vurtual> lots more than that
[1:01] <ZaxKellens|SS> Ok, that's what I was wondering
[1:01] <Quatroking> Yeah, inf. blocks
[1:01] <ZaxKellens|SS> No hacking for me
[1:02] <Snowman> He means hex editing
[1:02] * Animator (theysayima@adsl-153-214-188.mia.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[1:02] <Quatroking> its "legal hacking"
[1:02] * ChanServ sets mode +o Animator
[1:02] <Animator> Ker-back.
[1:02] <Quatroking> animator
[1:02] <Quatroking> burrrnnnnn
[1:02] <ZaxKellens|SS> Lol
[1:02] <Quatroking> we have two types of hacking in this community
[1:02] <Animator> Hm? What happened?
[1:03] <TrueWolves> Or you just don't use any hacking at all
[1:03] <TrueWolves> Never have, never will~
[1:03] * Earfolds (ookami@host81-158-89-106.range81-158.btcentralplus.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[1:03] <Quatroking> the type of hacking that involves retarded 10-year olds flying around because they don't have any sense of knowledge, think rickroll is still effing hilarious, and still gets breastfeeded by his mom/dad/grandparents
[1:04] <Animator> Ew.
[1:04] <Quatroking> and there's the type of hacking that involves some pretty handy manual skills, as well as general coding knowledge and a bit of math.
[1:04] <vurtual> Even though you said that hurtful comment, Quatroking, I'm still never gonna give you up.
[1:04] <Quatroking> the latter one is the one we accept in small terms.
[1:05] <Snowman> hex and memory editing is only for singleplayer
[1:05] <Quatroking> vurtual, yes, I know I can't get it from any other guy.
[1:05] <TrueWolves> ... I agree with Quatro on that accualy.
[1:05] <Snowman> That's why it's mostly accepted
[1:05] * Notch|ALANWAKE is now known as Notch
[1:05] <Quatroking> NOTCH
[1:05] <Snowman> Omg he's back
[1:05] <Quatroking> FUCK YEAH

[1:07] <thechris> holy crap its notch!
[1:07] <Notch> hey Visiiri
[1:07] <Quatroking> Visiiri, x86 is the 32-bit cpu type
[1:07] <sppt> nice :)
[1:07] <TrueWolves> ... aaaaand it begins!
[1:07] <Visiiri> Quatroking: Why isn't it x32?
[1:07] <Notch> good question!

[1:08] <Notch> rdr is released on friday here
[1:08] <Quatroking> 386, 486, anything after that was based on it so x86
[1:08] <Miclee> Ahhh.
[1:08] <Miclee> How about then?
[1:08] <TrueWolves> And who the hell commented and trolled that you couldn't have a break?
[1:08] <Visiiri> No wonder my mofo install disk didn't work
[1:08] * TrueWolves gets the tactical nuke ready.
[1:08] <Snowman> The term x86 derived from the fact that early successors to the 8086 also had names ending in "86".
[1:08] <Quatroking> didn't 386 and such get their name from the 8086?
[1:08] <Notch> well, a few people were upset
[1:08] <sppt> so uh, notch, if i want to start game programming in java, where should i start? i already made a shitty pong clone :D
[1:09] <Visiiri> I'm just sixteen, I'ev never heard any of it.
[1:09] <Visiiri> Notch: I'm upset!
[1:09] <TrueWolves> So Notch, you want to do the interview over e-mail then rather then IRC?
[1:09] <Notch> :D
[1:09] <Quatroking> Visiiri, be ashamed.
[1:09] <Visiiri> I said 'boom' in my Spanish class
[1:09] <Notch> Yeah, email.. And I'll try to reply. ;D
[1:09] <Visiiri> and apearently it's a bad word.
[1:09] <Visiiri> :(
[1:09] <Visiiri> She made me call my mum.
[1:09] <TrueWolves> XD don't worry to much on that Notch.
[1:09] <Notch> I actually don't spend that much time on my computer at the moment
[1:09] <Visiiri> I mean, what the hell.

[1:10] <Miclee> So Notch, RDR on the weekend, then?
[1:10] <TrueWolves> Oh, last question, Notch, can I be promoted to a channel op? I've been here scense Minecraft was only 2 weeks old and am sometimes on when the other ops are not, and I could get plenty of referinces from others. The reason I'm asking you is that the current ops want your permission.
[1:10] <Snowman> blaster, is the traincraft city up?
[1:11] <Snowman> server*
[1:11] <Quatroking> :o
[1:11] <Quatroking> Snowman for channel op '10

[1:11] <Quatroking> if anything
[1:11] <Notch> Hey, if the current ops want to op anyone, I'm fine with it. =)
[1:11] <Notch> no zeppelins!
[1:11] <thechris> notch, will you be able to get MP out faster if we can live with fintite maps for right now? i would think that would save some time
[1:11] <thechris> and we can all live with it for now
[1:11] <thechris> anyone agree?

[1:22] <Animator> I rewrote the IRC rules to be more fitting. Notch updated them.
[1:22] <bildramer> "Do not overly swear. The usual swear word is fine once in a while, but when you start going overboard, there
[1:22] <bildramer> will be action taken." deeeerp
[1:22] <bildramer> "9. Do not auto-join, this is considered bad form and is frowned upon." fuck yes
[1:22] <Animator> You can thank me for that.
[1:22] <Quatroking> uh
[1:22] <bildramer> thanks
[1:22] <vurtual> autojoin is in bad form of 1 out of every single other IRC channel.

[1:23] <Animator> The fact that now it states that the ops can get away with anything.
[1:23] <Yourself> i guess i'll just have to change my auto-join to rejoin on a random timer so that it's indistinguishable from me actually joining manually
[1:23] <Animator> Implied, of course.
[1:24] <bildramer> ...they can?
[1:24] <Animator> Yup.
[1:24] <bildramer> holy titcocks

[1:38] <blaster> What is a trainer for assasins creed?
[1:38] <vurtual> Why did valve suddenly decide to make Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero appear on my gamelist, with "purchase" as an option?
[1:38] <LG_Legacy> Beta
[1:38] <blaster> Because EA suddenly took em over?
[1:38] <vurtual> I have them preloaded, but I didn't even restart steam
[1:38] <Yourself> ea acquiring valve is a sign of the end times
[1:38] <vurtual> so it's not like an update decided all preloaded games would appear, or anything.
[1:38] <Visiiri> Yourself is correct.
[1:39] <Visiiri> EA has taken over alot before
[1:39] <Visiiri> and now their games suck
[1:39] <vurtual> EA doesn't ruin eeeverything
[1:39] <vurtual> instantly, at least

[1:40] <vurtual> Well, CoD without the horriblest decisions.
[1:41] <blaster> Maxis technicly no longer exist

[1:54] <Yourself> wtf
[1:54] <blaster> So if someone completed simcity, could someone complete minecraft?
[1:55] <bildramer> solving a game
[1:55] <bildramer> hm
[1:55] <bildramer> in non-luck based games it's always possibl
[1:55] <bildramer> e
[1:55] <bildramer> also, there is only a certain number of seeds
[1:55] <bildramer> so yeah
[1:56] <Yourself> provided the game state graph has no cycles
[1:56] * TrueWolves starts his new Minecraft super-project...
[1:56] <bildramer> ...eh?
[1:56] <blaster> I think a way to solve the game would be to create a enemy spawning mechanism
[1:57] <blaster> which spawns huge numbers of enemies
[1:57] <blaster> then the screwed ai makes em fall to their death
[1:57] <blaster> for huge money gain
[1:57] <Yourself> if you represent the game as a directed graph where each node is a potential state that the game can be in a cycle in the graph would mean there's a way to play the game such that it never ends
[1:57] <TrueWolves> ... I know how to do that.
[1:57] <bildramer> basically
[1:57] <bildramer> you can't win
[1:57] <bildramer> so...
[1:57] <vurtual> okay guys I'm faced with a decision here
[1:57] <bildramer> also, you can always keep not losing
[1:57] <bildramer> lol
[1:57] <TrueWolves> Infact, making the enemy spawn/killer would be easy!
[1:58] <vurtual> there is a bunch of regulars in a channel trolling some new guy, who is very dumb
[1:58] <TrueWolves> Just time consuming.
[1:58] <blaster> Bildramer winning in minecraft means NEVER being able to die

[1:58] <blaster> Minecraft is finite yourself
[1:58] <blaster> 8X surface area of earth
[1:58] <Konogan> Guys, fencing with sabres is awesome. :D
[1:58] <blaster> We fill that whole area with a GIANT computer made of lava
[1:58] <vurtual> blaster, you must turn every block into chopped wood.
[1:58] <Yourself> it doesn't have a goal condition, blaster
[1:58] <blaster> that can compute player movement
[1:58] <ZaxKellens|SS> Wat the...
[1:58] <Yourself> so it's not finite
[1:59] <Yourself> because there's no guaranteed end to the game
[1:59] <blaster> infinite maps are finite
[1:59] <Yourself> the game area is finite
[1:59] <bildramer> derp
[1:59] <Yourself> the game itself is not
[1:59] <Konogan> it ends when you lose?
[1:59] <vurtual> it has a finite number of states, Yourself.

[2:19] <EmpiresBane> no.
[2:19] <shairn> give it time :P
[2:19] <vurtual> you'd have to platform and find all the valve blocks.
[2:19] <vurtual> open them, flooding the room
[2:19] <vurtual> and then platform to a spot where the next floor stats.
[2:19] <Azathoth> (jk, if you're too retarded to realize)
[2:20] <rob`> has anyone made a flip-flop in minecraft?
[2:20] <TrueWolves> Is it possable to make sand-valves in creative mode or only threw a level editor?
[2:20] <shairn> sarcasm isn't easy over the net :P
[2:20] <vurtual> somehow you can make it so that you can't open the important one, without lowering all of them.
[2:20] <Azathoth> i made a giant sandal once
[2:20] <vurtual> you can in creative, just not a tripwire-one.
[2:20] <vurtual> just standard falling
[2:20] * TrueWolves nods
[2:20] <Azathoth> these mechanical computers in minecraft are kinda silly
[2:21] <TrueWolves> So, I'll split the sealab in to 3 types of rooms
[2:21] <Azathoth> i like wasting my time as much as the next guy, but jesus
[2:21] <TrueWolves> Normal rooms, can flood at any time from TNT/creeper activity, usualy where you can dig for supplies and maybe find one of the 10 secret sponges.
[2:21] <blaster> All we got to do is copy standard computer structure
[2:21] <vurtual> secret sponges thing sucks
[2:21] <shairn> sponges in survival?
[2:21] <blaster> Make the memory from flipflops
[2:21] <vurtual> how about the WHOLE THING is unexitable
[2:21] <vurtual> because it can't outright blow open
[2:21] <blaster> And we almost have it built
[2:22] <vurtual> just release water into infinite flood
[2:22] <TrueWolves> Puzzle rooms, needed to get to new areas, are made of stone so they don't flood normaly

[2:22] <TrueWolves> Secret rooms, all the fun and secret vent ducts and other fun stuff.
[2:22] <Azathoth> old news is old
[2:22] <vurtual> and you have to place sponges in certain spots in the massive gate, so when you open a valve system, water only flows down a single glass pipe(that's damaged, you have to repair it, too)
[2:23] <vurtual> then that'll flow through a one-wide hole, and fill up a watervator that has a Ubend in it
[2:23] <vurtual> so you can enter.
[2:23] <TrueWolves> ... so finding the sponges will be needed to unlock the exit at the very end of the huge sealab?
[2:23] <vurtual> yeah
[2:23] <vurtual> a few
[2:23] <vurtual> not a load
[2:23] * TrueWolves nods
[2:23] <vurtual> fairly obvious
[2:23] <vurtual> any other pipe being unblocked would cause something crazy to happen
[2:24] <Azathoth> moar liek gaylab

[2:28] <EmpiresBane> i'm going to make a fractal generator that does stuff like the Haferman carpet, but you'll be able to choose the rules
[2:28] <blaster> I think minimap and minecarts, they are the most requested features
[2:28] <Azathoth> i think the features he said he's going to put in it
[2:29] <EmpiresBane> i think i'll start with just the iteration rules, then later i'll allow you to choose the size of the grids
[2:29] <EmpiresBane> water will be first, i bet

Also, I got the applet loader code working, and know how to make the error messages much more readable and understandable, and I think I can fix the bug that occasionally causes the game to totally break and require deletion of the cached files."

[2:30] <EmpiresBane> i just hope his next optimizations don't screw me even more
[2:31] <shairn> also it's a pain to make a lot of wheat :(
[2:31] <EmpiresBane> not really
[2:31] <shairn> well
[2:31] <EmpiresBane> you set up the farm, then leave

[2:31] <shairn> no
[2:31] <ZaxKellens|SS> Hm, reading minepedia gives headache
[2:31] <shairn> but getting it hydrated is annoying

[2:34] <Azathoth> yes you do
[2:34] <shairn> indeed
[2:34] <ZaxKellens|SS> I want to farm and to have a base that doesn't get spawned in all the time

[2:36] <ZaxKellens|SS> Yeah, creeper blows up my base, makes me sad

[2:47] <Azathoth> using wooden tools is mentally retarded
[2:48] <shairn> I find it funny that you can mine stone with wood
[2:48] <Azathoth> stone is so plentiful, you will have plenty to build with and make tools with

[2:48] <Azathoth> yeah
[2:48] <blaster> Azathoth eventuly you will run out of stone

[2:51] <blaster> No need to expand beyond 120 homes
[2:51] <blaster> The houses will be built of stone, we will use some stone in constuction
[2:51] <vurtual> What if you have ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE PEOPLE

[2:56] <Azathoth> you can touch this
[2:57] <shairn> I can?
[2:58] <Azathoth> if you want
[2:58] <blaster> Ok lets assume that digging a stone block takes 1 seconde
[2:58] <vurtual> it takes a few ms with good tools
[2:58] <shairn> *touches*
[2:58] <vurtual> you can dig faster than you can walk sometimes
[2:58] <Azathoth> og baby
[2:58] <Azathoth> oh*
[2:58] <blaster> Add 50% for walking/crafting/aiming your dig
[2:58] <shairn> oooh that's hawt
[2:58] <vurtual> og?
[2:58] <vurtual> You're an ape?
[2:58] <vurtual> or caveman or something?
[2:58] <Azathoth> oooggggg baby
[2:58] <vurtual> "aiming your dig"
[2:58] <vurtual> What?
[2:58] <blaster> And thats 1.5 seconds for digging each block
[2:58] <vurtual> blaster, where are you even getthing these things from?
[2:58] <Azathoth> no, i just really like sound file formats
[2:58] <blaster> Vurtual turning and stuff
[2:58] <vurtual> ...
[2:58] <vurtual> HOW CAN THAT TAKE TIME
[2:59] <blaster> It adds a little
[2:59] <shairn> just hold left click
[2:59] <shairn> how hard is it
[2:59] <vurtual> HALF A MILLISECOND
[2:59] <blaster> The point is you wont spend your whole life digging
[2:59] <vurtual> THAT'S HOW MUCH IT ADDS
[2:59] <shairn> well it's minecraft
[2:59] <vurtual> You... TURN YOUR VIEW, how can TURNING YOUR VIEW take a long time
[2:59] <Azathoth> you will if you're using wooden tools
[2:59] <Azathoth> oh wait no
[2:59] <blaster> so I added 50% MADE UP MOSTLY OF WALKING AND CRAFTING
[2:59] <vurtual> you could factor in your finger twitching and hitting a button late
[2:59] <blaster> but a tiny bit aiming
[2:59] <Azathoth> you'll use the other half of your life making more tools every 5 seconds
[2:59] <shairn> hehe
[3:00] <blaster> And that means you can dig 400 stone per day
[3:00] <blaster> My settlement takes up...
[3:00] <shairn> well that's more than enough
[3:00] <shairn> assuming you,re not a lone :P
[3:00] <shairn> alone*
[3:00] <blaster> 116X72
[3:00] <Azathoth> or you could use stone tools and dig 3 times as much stone
[3:01] <Azathoth> you'll only waste 3 stone per... 64? or is 128?
[3:01] <blaster> If it was at 1 block above sea level, the best for farming

[3:02] <blaster> With 120 people
[3:02] <blaster> Ok lets take into account a 1024x1024 area using iron tools
[3:03] <blaster> digging time is reduced by about half
[3:03] <Azathoth> where the hell are you getting 120 people?

[3:05] <blaster> Thats fast
[3:05] <blaster> In permaserver terms
[3:05] <EmpiresBane> i didn't see the day conversion
[3:05] <blaster> Day = 10 mins
[3:05] <Azathoth> *sigh*
[3:05] <blaster> RLD = 24 hours
[3:05] <blaster> Duh
[3:06] <Azathoth> that's how long a real day is?
[3:06] <Azathoth> thanks, i didn't know
[3:06] <EmpiresBane> no...
[3:06] <blaster> or if you want to be accurate 23.56
[3:06] <shairn> so basically
[3:06] <EmpiresBane> i meant i didn't see the conversion until after i said that

[3:06] <Azathoth> shairn, he'll run out eventually!

[3:07] <vede> blaster, you're retarded.
[3:07] <shairn> yeah a 67mil block castle
[3:07] <Azathoth> because you know creepers just randomly explode
[3:07] <vede> A day is more than 23.56 hours.
[3:07] <Azathoth> vede, thank you
[3:07] <Azathoth> i've been dieing to say it, but i don't have the testicles
[3:07] <shairn> oh you.
[3:07] <vede> You think we lose a half-hour every single day?
[3:07] <blaster> A 67mil block city would take up about 2048x2048 space without taking into account constuction materials
[3:07] <Azathoth> lol
[3:07] <blaster> Vede thats minuets
[3:07] <shairn> I love minuets.
[3:07] <Azathoth> ROFL

[3:08] <blaster> And what about defending the city, that begins draining more until you use up 4X the original constuction thing
[3:08] <vede> Is it 23.56 hours or 23.56 minutes?
[3:08] <blaster> 23 hours 56 minuets
[3:08] <vede> Both are horrendously wrong.
[3:08] <shairn> defending from what? creepers will blow up like 1 square of rock
[3:08] <Azathoth> LOL
[3:08] <Azathoth> it wasn't even a typo
[3:08] <vede> It's more than that, too, blaster.
[3:08] <Azathoth> minuets
[3:08] <shairn> that's a lot of minuets
[3:08] <blaster> Sharin terrorists using tnt
[3:08] <shairn> tnt is like creeper
[3:08] <shairn> so really you'd need a lot of it :P
[3:09] <blaster> Enemies deconstucting stuff and taking it
[3:09] <vede> By that logic, every month, we'd have to adjust our clocks to deal with the two hours we've lost.
[3:09] <EmpiresBane> is NTFS or FAT32 faster?
[3:09] <blaster> People reconstucting there houses using up tools
[3:09] <Azathoth> minuets of the forest
[3:09] <blaster> Vede the earth orbiting the sun cancels out its effects
[3:09] <shairn> doesn't matter blaster beacuse you'll never need 67 mil blocks of stone
[3:09] <blaster> we spin around 366 times a year
[3:09] <quaxar> NTFS is faster because it increases RPM
[3:09] <shairn> 365.25
[3:09] <quaxar> No NTFS just auto defrags
[3:09] <quaxar> so you dont have to fuck with that shit
[3:10] <blaster> SHARIN i am talking about earth rotations
[3:10] <quaxar> So do NTFS
[3:10] <blaster> not days
[3:10] <quaxar> its read and writable in linux, mac and windows
[3:10] <EmpiresBane> good.
[3:10] <shairn> I see the difference.
[3:10] <quaxar> NTFS is the only file system for all OS
[3:10] <Azathoth> vede
[3:10] <blaster> Every Nychthemeron you have 10 minecraft minuets
[3:10] <Azathoth> don't even bother arguing with blaster

[3:19] <Azathoth> no one would be able to host this 120 person server on their personal connection
[3:19] <blaster> Someone is bound to pay out for a profesional server
[3:19] <quaxar> actually someone can
[3:19] * zenon is now known as Nyarlathotep
[3:19] <blaster> Dont know who but someone will
[3:19] <blaster> I could run it on my school network
[3:19] <Azathoth> lol
[3:19] <blaster> 16TB storage
[3:19] <Nyarlathotep> Yeah, I'm sure they'll be thrilled about that
[3:19] <Azathoth> storage isn't the issue here...
[3:20] <Nyarlathotep> and it would still run like shit because other people would be using it
[3:20] <EmpiresBane> my school only has 1TB
[3:20] <vede> Azathoth, no, but servers aren't necessarily made for home connections.
[3:20] <Azathoth> well
[3:20] <Azathoth> how is blaster going to afford to rent a server?
[3:20] <Nyarlathotep> look, the biggest problem is you're not going to get 120 people
[3:20] <quaxar> Actually servers are made for home conditions
[3:21] <vede> And actually, some people probably could run that on their personal connection.
[3:21] <EmpiresBane> damnit!
[3:21] <Azathoth> i seriously doubt that
[3:21] <quaxar> Its just that if you want to serve 50 peoples websites a home condition is not what is best
[3:21] <quaxar> Or 50 somethings
[3:21] <EmpiresBane> C# is trying to convert 0 to a boolean value when i want to check for the number 0
[3:21] <blaster> Them new fibre optics guys
[3:22] <quaxar> Yeah, edible plant glasses made out of cellulose
[3:22] <quaxar> natures colon fiber
[3:22] <Azathoth> empires, what data type are you using?
[3:22] <vede> Azathoth, there's connection services with 5MB/s download and something else that's also really fast for upload speed.
[3:22] <EmpiresBane> int
[3:22] <quaxar> 20mb down and up was the best connection I had at home
[3:22] <EmpiresBane> i'm saying if (bet = 0)
[3:22] <quaxar> some mormon born again ISP in a small town
[3:23] <vede> Considering that the actual information that needs to be sent for Minecraft is pretty slim, I could see some pretty large servers being run from people's homes.
[3:23] <Nyarlathotep> Look, my l4d2 server, for EIGHT people was like 20 dollars and I bought that while it was on sale. Good luck paying for a 120 person server
[3:23] <Azathoth> the up speed would be the real limiting factor
[3:23] <EmpiresBane> and it gave me an error about not implicitely converting
[3:23] <vede> EmpiresBane, assuming C# is remotely like C++, the problem is that you're using = and not ==
[3:23] <Azathoth> empiresbane
[3:23] <Azathoth> ==
[3:23] <EmpiresBane> shit!
[3:23] <EmpiresBane> you're right
[3:23] <Azathoth> lol
[3:23] <LuciferZ> Okay you guys know the theory of making AI by replicating a living human's brain with circuitry?
[3:23] <vede> LuciferZ, sure.
[3:23] <EmpiresBane> Neural Networking?
[3:23] <LuciferZ> Are any of you familiar with Problem Sleuth?
[3:24] <Azathoth> no.

[3:24] <LuciferZ> Then nevermind.
[3:24] <vede> Neural networking isn't the same as recreating a brain with circuitry, EmpiresBane.
[3:24] <EmpiresBane> isn't it based on the brain?
[3:25] <vede> Somewhat.
[3:25] <Azathoth> with an accurate enough neural network simulation, i don't see why you couldn't simulate a brain
[3:25] * revenant (dlukes@pool-74-111-168-109.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft

[3:27] <EmpiresBane> i read something about neural networking in a book once....
[3:28] <EmpiresBane> i don't remember much of it, unfortunately...
[3:28] <Yourself> neural networking generally doesn't allow the network to form new connection
[3:28] <Yourself> only reweight the contributions of existing connections
[3:28] <Azathoth> it can

[3:30] <Azathoth> i don't know. i took some research course for one semester about neural networkings
[3:30] <Yourself> there's nothing specifically that forbids the changing of the connections, it's just difficult to simulate and can create feedback in the network, which has to be dealt with carefully

[3:38] <EmpiresBane> my dice roller fails...
[3:38] <Azathoth> lol
[3:39] <EmpiresBane> i think it has to do with the seed
[3:39] <Azathoth> you're just making a dice roller, empires?
[3:39] <vurtual> JC2 apparently doesn't want me to have fun
[3:39] <Azathoth> how can it fail...
[3:39] <EmpiresBane> no
[3:39] <Azathoth> oh
[3:39] <EmpiresBane> but dice rolling function is part of it
[3:39] <vurtual> just got ANOTHER driver crash
[3:39] <Azathoth> are you creating new Randoms constantly?
[3:39] <vurtual> WHY AM I GETTING DRIVER CRASHES
[3:39] <EmpiresBane> i think i am
[3:39] <Azathoth> because it uses the time as the seed
[3:40] <Azathoth> so if you keep creating new ones every few milliseconds
[3:40] <EmpiresBane> everytime it calls the function
[3:40] <Azathoth> they're probably using the same seed then
[3:40] <Azathoth> do you have a diceroller class?
[3:40] <EmpiresBane> but doesn't the seed change evertime it generates a number?
[3:40] <EmpiresBane> and no
[3:41] <EmpiresBane> just a function
[3:41] <Azathoth> no
[3:41] <Azathoth> seed changes when you call the constructor
[3:41] <EmpiresBane> really....
[3:41] * KEROLiUKAS (kp@c-24-7-220-190.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:41] <EmpiresBane> hm. that would explain why i only get certain numbers
[3:41] <Azathoth> then you'll need to have a Random object somewhere that isn't created on every call of that function
[3:42] <Azathoth> i imagine you're getting strings of the same number like 111111113333332222444444
[3:42] <Azathoth> kinda like that?
[3:42] <EmpiresBane> no
[3:42] <EmpiresBane> you see. it just gets a random number between 0 and 6
[3:42] <EmpiresBane> it does this twice
[3:42] <EmpiresBane> then it adds them
[3:43] <Azathoth> mmhmm
[3:43] <EmpiresBane> but i think it gets the same number both times
[3:43] <vurtual> Now what am I going to do!?
[3:43] <vurtual> The natural order of fun has been DISRUPTED
[3:43] <EmpiresBane> i first learned to program in delphi so i've been operating on some wrong assumptions
[3:43] <Azathoth> well either way, i'm pretty sure your problem involves the c# Random object getting shitty seeds
[3:44] <vurtual> The massive calendar governing the very concept of fun cannot continue!
[3:44] <Visiiri> Soooooo
[3:44] <Visiiri> How's it going up in here?
[3:44] <EmpiresBane> that's what i'm thinking now
[3:44] <Azathoth> you just need to call it less often
[3:44] * blaster (heliduels@78.150.68.117) has joined #minecraft
[3:44] <EmpiresBane> that doesn't really work....
[3:44] <EmpiresBane> it's a game of craps
[3:45] <EmpiresBane> calling less often can't happen
[3:45] <blaster> Does minecraft use seeds for levels?
[3:45] <EmpiresBane> blaster...
[3:45] <Azathoth> i mean you need to create one Random object at the beginning and keep it
[3:45] <EmpiresBane> everything random uses seeds
[3:45] <blaster> Is there a way to see minecrafts seed
[3:45] <EmpiresBane> oh.
[3:45] <EmpiresBane> make a global object?
[3:45] <blaster> Does it use 1 seed for everything or a separate random number for everything
[3:45] <Visiiri> EmpiresBane, come play on vede's server with me
[3:46] <Azathoth> is your dice roller method inside another class?
[3:46] <Visiiri> vede, come play on vede's server with me.
[3:46] <EmpiresBane> i can't at the moment
[3:46] <Visiiri> :(((((((
[3:46] <vede> Heh.
[3:46] <EmpiresBane> Azathoth, no. i don't have any classes
[3:46] <Azathoth> :|
[3:46] <Visiiri> Connectioning
[3:46] <blaster> Because being able to put in your own seed would be nice
[3:46] <EmpiresBane> it's a real simple prgram
[3:46] <Azathoth> so you're just using a single file with a void main or something?
[3:46] <EmpiresBane> yes
[3:46] <blaster> If you find a odd/weird indev map and want to share without uploading being able to share the seed would be epic
[3:46] <Azathoth> then put the Random object as a class level variable
[3:46] <vede> Getting bored of mountain maps.
[3:47] <vede> Peeps need to come up with a map idea that's just totally off-the-wall for me to use on my server.
[3:47] <blaster> Canyons
[3:47] <blaster> Massive ones
[3:47] <blaster> ANTARTICA
[3:47] <vede> <vede> ... map idea that's just totally off-the-wall
[3:47] <vurtual> vede, cliffs
[3:47] <Azathoth> i think you can create a new instance of it when you declare it too
[3:47] <vede> You fail at detaching things from the wall.
[3:47] <EmpiresBane> vede! make everything upside-down!
[3:47] <vurtual> like smooth mountains, with sharp drops and smoother.
[3:47] <Azathoth> and then just use that for all the methods that need a random number
[3:47] <vurtual> so you build along the sides
[3:48] <blaster> Vurtual how about the hurricane katrena map I made
[3:48] <Azathoth> katrina*
[3:48] <vurtual> I had a dream bout that hurricane
[3:48] <vurtual> except new orleans was cliffy
[3:48] <Azathoth> you're cliffy

[3:49] <Azathoth> that is a great idea :O

[3:50] <Azathoth> what am i a unicorn demon or something?
[3:50] <blaster> A dickhead
[3:50] <Azathoth> i like unicorn demons better
[3:50] <EmpiresBane> that was a terrible insult...

[3:51] <vurtual> A cliffs map would be awesome.
[3:51] <EmpiresBane> as soon as vede changes the map, i'll join

[3:51] <blaster> http://i43.tinypic.com/20ge4vb.png here ya go vede
[3:51] <Azathoth> what's that?

[3:51] <blaster> My world machine terrain generator
[3:51] <blaster> Nice right?
[3:51] <Azathoth> no
[3:51] <blaster> Just make that coming off the wall
[3:52] <blaster> Azathoth whats wrong with it
[3:52] <blaster> not enough butsecks?
[3:52] <EmpiresBane> off the wall means "completely different"
[3:52] <Azathoth> well it just....

[7:38] <vurtual> how have they recognized prop hunt, Kodaichi? I forgot
[7:39] <Kodaichi> they made it so that custom models wouldn't have a domination symbol above their heads, for prop hunt
[7:40] <Kodaichi> was in one of the updates, either the 119th, oer a couple before or after

[7:53] <EmpiresBane> what is the use of multiplying vectors?
[7:54] <Yourself> multiplying how?
[7:54] <Speljohan_> ^
[7:54] <EmpiresBane> apperantly its possible somehow...
[7:54] <Speljohan_> om nom first incarnation of my opengl ui system done.. http://ddd.pastebin.com/qsSEsr70
[7:54] <Speljohan_> depends on the context EmpiresBane
[7:54] <Yourself> yeah, it's possible to define several products on vectors
[7:55] <EmpiresBane> how is it even done?
[7:55] * TkTech is now known as TkTech|Away
[7:55] <Yourself> it depends
[7:57] <EmpiresBane> on...?
[7:57] <Yourself> what you want to do
[7:58] <EmpiresBane> hm... then nvm
[7:58] <Yourself> the most common kind of product defined for vectors is the dot product
[7:58] * FakeSky (FakeSky@112.201.205.145) Quit (Quit: BiFF)
[7:58] <Yourself> it operates on two vectors and produces a scalar
[7:58] * Agarrett (Mibbit@71-223-57-188.phnx.qwest.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[7:59] <Yourself> there's the cross product, which is only defined for 3D vectors
[7:59] <Yourself> it operates on two vectors and produces a vector which is mutually orthogonal to both
[8:00] <Yourself> there's also an outer product, which is the tensor product of two vectors
[8:00] <Yourself> takes two vectors and produces a rank 2 tensor
[8:01] <Yourself> there's a triple product, which is a combination cross product and dot product and operates on three vectors
[8:01] <EmpiresBane> i think that's enough...
[8:01] <Yourself> produces a scalar
[8:02] <Yourself> that one's used for computing volumes
[8:02] <Yourself> among other things
[8:04] <Yourself> why do you ask?
[8:06] <Codlike> Wait, tf2 prophunt?

[8:07] <vurtual> Codlike, you won't find whoever is the cap point model

[9:27] <vurtual> I'm going to keep on seeing how many variations of my geordi skin I can do
[9:29] <vede> Awesome. My SimCity rip-off now has an actual money counter, and every month (currently three seconds) all the buildings in the map contribute to either increasing or decreasing it.
[9:29] <vede> Which means that the buildings actually function properly.

[9:49] <vurtual> There are times I just go "why did they even do that?"
[9:50] <vurtual> for level of detail
[9:50] <vurtual> how some individual trees, in a non-graphically-intensive area, are very obvious lone sprites.

[9:52] <vurtual> BROWN SUGAR CINNAMON ONES
[9:52] <vurtual> did a city scanner just take a picture of Gordon in the menu?
[9:52] <vurtual> ...yes, yes it did
[9:53] <Dommys> I like brown sugar cinnamon ones, but the icing is ALWAYS way too thick
[9:53] <vurtual> not here
[9:53] <vurtual> also, unfrosted ones
[9:53] <vurtual> these are frosted
[9:53] <Dommys> I usually buy unfrosted though
[9:53] <Dommys> Yeah :D
[9:53] <vurtual> but unfrosted pwn
[9:53] <vurtual> okay there's a few more trees, but still
[9:54] <vurtual> I walked away from the main area, and some very centerpiece-important rocks just faded out of view?
[9:54] <vurtual> there's not even any water falling down the dam, despite the sound
[9:55] <bildramer> in the menu?
[9:55] <bildramer> whoa

[9:56] <vurtual> It feels modeeeern

[9:59] <vurtual> now here's hoping episode 3 has all of the left 4 dead self-shadowed bump mapping stuff
[10:00] <vurtual> maybe even fully shadowing bumpmapping, so if you cast a light on a brick wall, the brick shadow casts down onto a surface below.

[11:45] <Speljohan_> the guy with a wart in his face
[11:45] <eritz> but xanatos was such an epic schemer, he got a trope named after him!

[11:47] <Speljohan_> needs moooar
[11:48] <Speljohan_> i've watch all but the animated series
[11:48] <Speljohan_> cus they do not interest me
[11:49] <vurtual> not likely
[11:49] <vurtual> especially after the unstartrekly movie

[11:49] <Speljohan_> word goes around they will release more, but not for another few years
[11:49] <Speljohan_> ps the new movie sucks and made me lose hope in humanity
[11:49] <eritz> first, they need to make with more blu-ray releases of the old shows
[11:50] <eritz> preferably starting with TNG
[11:50] <Speljohan_> what a waste of time
[11:50] <vurtual> also no matter what, you can't really make a star trek that can top TNG
[11:50] <Speljohan_> that's correct
[11:50] <vurtual> without being a bit of more of the same
[11:50] <Speljohan_> i have enjoyed all of the series though
[11:51] <vurtual> I mean like, TOS was already done
[11:51] <vurtual> TNG was already done
[11:51] <vurtual> VOY was... well, not that great.
[11:51] <vurtual> DS9 was on a space station!
[11:51] <Speljohan_> voyager was more of the same thing
[11:51] <Speljohan_> ds9 grew onto me
[11:51] <vurtual> and then enterprise reminded us that you can't do it anymore.
[11:51] <Speljohan_> and became quite entertaining
[11:51] <eritz> what this era of television needs is the return of the anthology
[11:51] <Speljohan_> needs moar sci-fi series that don't suck as well
[11:51] <eritz> too many continuous plots, complicated arcs
[11:52] <vurtual> Voyager was better than watching how its made for the ten trillionth time
[11:52] <vurtual> now there's not even reruns
[11:52] <eritz> twilight zone and alfred hitchcock hour are two of the best series ever made
[11:52] <vurtual> I mean seriously
[11:52] <vurtual> I'm going to check again
[11:52] <vurtual> it's 3AM already aaaa
[11:53] <Speljohan_> i'm going to rewatch TNG after i'm done with ds9
[11:53] <vurtual> also wait guys, I just realised.
[11:53] <Speljohan_> eg by this weekend
[11:53] <vurtual> someday, all of this will be public domain
[11:53] <vurtual> will people even care?
[11:53] <eritz> hopefully
[11:53] <eritz> i'll care
[11:53] <vurtual> you'll be an old man, though.
[11:53] <eritz> my children will probably care
[11:53] <Speljohan_> i've been on irc for the past 11 years
[11:53] <vurtual> who knows
[11:53] <Speljohan_> doubt that will ever change
[11:54] <vurtual> Then again, there are some things that just can't be forgotten.
[11:54] <eritz> season 1 of The Twilight Zone aired in... 1959, i think
[11:54] <vurtual> There will always be a guy who will like things from the 80s.
[11:54] <eritz> 40 years before i was even born
[11:54] <eritz> and i still care
[11:54] <vurtual> what if we eventually make so many videogames, and so much culture, that nobody can PROCESS IT ALL!?
[11:54] <eritz> more like 30 years, actually
[11:54] <Speljohan_> there will always be awesome pessimists like me who hate nearly everything made between 1994 and 2010
[11:54] <Speljohan_> :D
[11:54] <vurtual> I mean really, how many "classics" have you played?
[11:55] <eritz> between 1994 and 2010?
[11:55] <eritz> 1996 gave us Pinky and the Brain!
[11:55] <vurtual> what about games, Speljohan_?
[11:55] <vurtual> Do you hate games made between 1994 and 2010?
[11:55] <vurtual> Is there even a game out there you don't hate?
[11:55] <Speljohan_> more like 2000 to 2010 for games
[11:56] <vurtual> half-life 2? What about most valve games?
[11:56] <eritz> i dunno, that was the start of the PS2 era

[11:56] <Speljohan_> when the market started becoming oversaturated was when i lost all hope
[11:56] <vurtual> just cause 2 was pretty awesome

[11:56] <eritz> like Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing
[11:56] <Speljohan_> i've told you before i am not an fps guy vurtual
[11:56] <Speljohan_> :P
[11:56] <vurtual> Soul Reaver 2 came out in 01
[11:56] <vurtual> you, sir, are insane.
[11:56] <eritz> and then there's various shin megami tensei games
[11:57] <vurtual> I mean, how can you not be an FPS guy?
[11:57] <vurtual> Does your body not produce adrenaline?
[11:57] <eritz> almost all of which are good in their own way
[11:57] <vurtual> Are you always slow?
[11:57] <vurtual> slow motion?
[11:57] <Speljohan_> adrenaline from an fps? never happened
[11:57] <eritz> happens to me
[11:57] <vurtual> You haven't played a decent FPS then.
[11:57] <Speljohan_> yes i have, but i find it repetetive and dull
[11:57] <Speljohan_> + i'm a shit aim
[11:57] <vurtual> LEARN TO BE BETTER
[11:57] <eritz> perfect, modern console FPS aim FOR you!
[11:58] <eritz> lol
[11:58] <Speljohan_> actually that's even harder for me eritz
[11:58] <Speljohan_> i've tried
[11:58] <vurtual> Only through hardened practice can you become the very best, that no one ever was.
[11:58] <Speljohan_> lol
[11:58] <vurtual> what about metroid prime?
[11:58] <Speljohan_> i have no intention of becoming the best
[11:58] <vurtual> Did you hate that?
[11:58] <vurtual> THEN YOU ARE NOT A MAN
[11:58] <eritz> but seriously, i'm not really 'an FPS guy' either
[11:58] <vurtual> It's pretty much what defines someone being a man
[11:58] <eritz> but i enjoy me some L4D2
[11:58] <Speljohan_> lies
[11:58] <Speljohan_> beating women is what defines a man
[11:58] <vurtual> l4d2 sucks
[11:58] <Speljohan_> and being grumpy
[11:58] <eritz> the fun is playing with friends
[11:58] <eritz> real-life friends
[11:58] <eritz> preferably in LAN
[11:58] <Speljohan_> i hate LAN's
[11:58] <vurtual> men have adrenaline, testosterone, the urge toa chieve
[11:58] <Speljohan_> :/
[11:58] <vurtual> stereotypical women don't
[11:59] <Speljohan_> i prefer sitting at home, being cozy!
[11:59] <vurtual> a woman would probably want world peace
[11:59] <eritz> the LANs come to my house
[11:59] <eritz> so i'm still pretty cozt
[11:59] <vurtual> a man would want the power to create world peace, BY FORCE.

[12:00] <Speljohan_> i've still been checking out new titles eritz
[12:00] <Azathoth> i lost interest in Speljohan_ almost completely in like 2010 or so
[12:01] <Speljohan_> but i never found a game that could hold my attention for more than 15 minutes
[12:01] <vurtual> PS3 has nogames
[12:01] <Speljohan_> with a few exceptions of course
[12:01] <Azathoth> then you're just too picky
[12:01] <Speljohan_> maybe so
[12:01] <eritz> yeah, there are still good games
[12:01] <Speljohan_> i am picky with everything though
[12:01] <LuciferZ> Speljohan go play D&D
[12:01] <Speljohan_> d&d is mad fun
[12:01] <eritz> maybe you're just looking in the wrong place?
[12:01] <Speljohan_> we still tabletop from time to time
[12:02] <eritz> maybe the things you look at aren't actually what you want?
[12:02] <LuciferZ> Make your own game by sacrificing speed
[12:02] <Speljohan_> nah eritz
[12:02] <vurtual> Speljohan_, robot servant, or motorcycle with wall-clinging wheels?
[12:02] <Speljohan_> it's not that
[12:02] <Speljohan_> neither vurtual
[12:02] <vurtual> you are neither then
[12:02] <vurtual> a reverse-triangle, with small hips, and shoulders pressed together
[12:03] <vurtual> very much not male or female
[12:03] <Speljohan_> however, as i've said before, there are exceptions
[12:03] <vurtual> no kind of reproductive organs or hormones
[12:03] <Azathoth> d&d IS mad fun
[12:03] <Speljohan_> dragon age for instance, first game i completely finished in several years
[12:03] <vurtual> Speljohan_, have you played half-life?
[12:03] <Speljohan_> first game since baldur's gate 2 to make me lose track of time
[12:03] <vurtual> the first, 1998 game.
[12:03] <Azathoth> that's before 2003
[12:03] <Speljohan_> yes, and i didn't like it vurtual
[12:03] <vurtual> you are not allowed to come here now
[12:03] <vurtual> what about portal?
[12:03] <Speljohan_> portal was a gem
[12:03] <Speljohan_> but wayyyy too short
[12:03] <vurtual> and you hate half-life?
[12:03] <Speljohan_> and easy
[12:04] <vurtual> what about the portal mods?
[12:04] <vurtual> Portal: prelude
[12:04] <Speljohan_> prelude was nice
[12:04] <Yourself> portal was never meant to be a full game
[12:04] <Azathoth> portal gay gay gay?
[12:04] <vurtual> that's longer. And harder.
[12:04] <Speljohan_> very hard
[12:04] <vurtual> boner!
[12:04] <vurtual> anyways now that I'm done killing any innuendo from Azathoth
[12:04] <vurtual> you are lying, as you cannot not enjoy half-life, but also enjoy portal.
[12:04] <Yourself> interestingly, the whole HL2 tie-in was because such a small team was working on it and they didn't have time to do their own art sources
[12:04] <Yourself> and ended up reusing HL2 resources
[12:05] <vurtual> as that would require simeltaneously being a mindless husk, but not a mindless husk

[12:05] <Speljohan_> nah, you just have trouble accepting other people's opinions
[12:05] <Yourself> well, not so much time as they didn't have someone to do it
[12:05] <Speljohan_> so in a way you are much like me
[12:05] <Speljohan_> :D
[12:05] <vurtual> I've never met anyone who didn't like half-life
[12:05] <Azathoth> portal didn't use that many HL2 textures and almost no models
[12:05] <vurtual> ever.
[12:05] <Speljohan_> now you have vurtual
[12:05] <vurtual> well, one guy, that one guy, who quit on the tram ride.
[12:05] <vurtual> but he's a 15 year old without hormones
[12:05] <vurtual> maybe you're him
[12:06] <vurtual> no I will not play the passing with you over again
[12:06] <Yourself> Azathoth, they didn't want to use any

[12:06] <Speljohan_> :D
[12:06] <Speljohan_> ps vurtual i have hair!!
[12:06] <Speljohan_> probably more than most people here
[12:06] <Azathoth> wat
[12:06] <Speljohan_> inb4 cut it
[12:06] <Azathoth> speljohan is 19?
[12:06] <Yourself> according to the developers that connection won't be played up in portal 2
[12:06] <vurtual> you are small child to me then
[12:06] <LuciferZ> I didn't like half life
[12:06] <Yourself> but it has to be played up in ep 3
[12:06] <Speljohan_> yes Azathoth
[12:07] <vurtual> z get out of here
[12:07] <vurtual> you're no longer cool
[12:07] <vurtual> and disowned
[12:07] <Yourself> because you're going to the fucking borealis
[12:07] <LuciferZ> I'm mega cool

[12:07] <Yourself> and i want it now
[12:07] <Azathoth> i thought you were older. i'm actually older than you :|
[12:07] <Yourself> NOW
[12:07] <LuciferZ> You just can't handle it
[12:07] <Speljohan_> haha
[12:07] <vurtual> YOU DON'T LIKE THIS Z?
[12:07] <vurtual> THAT SONG?
[12:07] <Speljohan_> that's nothing new Azathoth
[12:07] <LuciferZ> I didn't say I disliked the soundtrack
[12:07] <vurtual> WHAT ABOUT THE IMMERSION?
[12:07] <LuciferZ> I just didn't like the game as a whole.
[12:07] <vurtual> that made tresspasser look unrealistic
[12:07] <Speljohan_> my irl friends are generally aged 24-38 Azathoth
[12:07] <LuciferZ> Wasn't that immersive to me.
[12:07] <Speljohan_> i have like 2 friends my own age
[12:07] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:08] <vurtual> then you weren't playing half-life
[12:08] <Azathoth> whoever composed music for valve....
[12:08] <vurtual> there weren't any cutscenes, man. Not one.
[12:08] <Azathoth> deserves a nice cock sucking
[12:08] <vurtual> They have their own guy, Azathoth.
[12:08] <Azathoth> composes*
[12:08] <vurtual> a very unnoticable guy
[12:08] <eritz> even harder to notice now that gabe ate him
[12:08] <Speljohan_> anywayz, i prefer music to every other form of entertainment
[12:08] <Azathoth> yeah, and he deserves to have his penis sucked upon by beautiful women
[12:08] <LuciferZ> I found Minecraft single player more immersive for the first three days I played it.
[12:08] <Speljohan_> that and composition
[12:08] <vurtual> http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Kelly_Bailey
[12:08] <Yourself> Azathoth, that would be Kelly Bailey
[12:08] <eritz> fortunately, gabe is like kirby
[12:09] <eritz> an amorphous lump that takes on the powers of those he eats
[12:09] <Azathoth> :D
[12:09] <vurtual> He worked for 48 hours straight.
[12:09] <Speljohan_> lol, reminds me of richard gariott's early life
[12:09] <Speljohan_> when he wrote his first rpg's (age 17-18)
[12:09] <Yourself> anyway, portal 2 is meant to be the full game
[12:09] <Yourself> and looks like it'll be good
[12:09] <eritz> before he started wearing the crown?
[12:09] <Yourself> and i'll be getting it
[12:09] <Speljohan_> kinda eritz
[12:10] <Yourself> and it will, again, interfere with my school work
[12:10] <vurtual> Face of Gordon himself
[12:10] <Speljohan_> he became lord british in high school!
[12:10] <Azathoth> more liek richard gay
[12:10] <vurtual> also mindblow, he based some tracks off of other works
[12:10] <Speljohan_> people called him british because he had british accent
[12:10] <vurtual> NO WONDER THOSE SOUNDED THE SAME
[12:10] <Speljohan_> moar liek ur gay Azathoth
[12:10] <vurtual> IT IS A CONSPIRACY
[12:10] <Azathoth> oh yeah. i think richard garriot lives in the same city as me
[12:10] <Azathoth> and he has a mansion or something and hosts epic parties
[12:10] <eritz> richard garriott lives in space now, he bribed the astronauts to leave him up there
[12:11] <Azathoth> why does this kelly bailey guy look like such a badass?
[12:11] <Speljohan_> richard gariott and raph koster were the 2 biggest pioneers of gaming in the 90's
[12:11] <Azathoth> moar liek kelly freeman >_>
[12:11] <Speljohan_> !
[12:11] <vurtual> Because he worked for 48 hours straight to make the resonance cascade, Azathoth.
[12:11] <vurtual> and is the face of Gordon Freeman.
[12:11] <eritz> recent measurements suggest garriott's ego is slightly altering the earth's orbit
[12:11] <vurtual> 48 hours, a whole weekend, of being awake, doing nothing but working.
[12:11] <Azathoth> lol
[12:11] <Speljohan_> indeed eritz
[12:11] <Speljohan_> :D
[12:11] <Azathoth> this is my favorite song from HL1: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLfPUtZqdV4&NR=1
[12:11] <vurtual> and then everyone was like "WOAAAAH"
[12:12] <Speljohan_> it's cool that raph koster still haven't been corrupted by the big companies and their nazi-dreams
[12:12] <Speljohan_> he still believes virtual worlds are the future of mmo gaming!
[12:12] <Speljohan_> just like he did in the early 90's
[12:12] <Azathoth> the future of MMO gaming is wow
[12:12] <vurtual> wait
[12:12] <vurtual> what is going on here
[12:12] <eritz> i say the future lies in augmentation
[12:12] <Azathoth> as in
[12:12] <Speljohan_> sadly it is Azathoth
[12:12] <vurtual> I have found a SECOND CONSPIRACY PEOPLE
[12:12] <Azathoth> it's going nowhere
[12:13] <vurtual> This also an eerily close song
[12:13] <Azathoth> and WoW will dominate until the end of humanity
[12:13] <vurtual> just one second
[12:13] <Speljohan_> probably :(
[12:13] <Azathoth> my vision is augmented
[12:13] <eritz> the future of MMO gaming lies in augmented reality
[12:13] <Yourself> so is mine
[12:13] <Yourself> my vision is augmented by glasses
[12:13] <Speljohan_> the future of MMO gaming is more arcade-child games for casuals
[12:13] <Yourself> and i probably need the prescription to be updated
[12:13] <Yourself> since i have a hard time distinguishing w's from v's
[12:14] <Azathoth> nanotech augmentation > glasses

[12:14] <Yourself> k
[12:14] <vurtual> Why are there... eerily similar tracks in half-life and quake games
[12:14] <eritz> i have a hard time distinguishing iPad owners from smug apple fanboys... do i need new glasses?
[12:14] <Speljohan_> i wish i brought my cassettes to town today :(
[12:14] <vurtual> Half-life came out before quake 3! This makes no sense!
[12:14] <Azathoth> lol
[12:14] <Speljohan_> totally a perfect day to sit in the sun and listen to music
[12:14] <Azathoth> vurtual
[12:15] <Azathoth> i think you're just seeing patterns because you're looking for them
[12:15] <Speljohan_> eritz, your glasses are working perfectly
[12:15] <Speljohan_> don't worry about it!
[12:15] <Azathoth> although they do sound pretty similar
[12:15] <eritz> i thought so
[12:15] <eritz> have any of you guys seen Dennou Coil?
[12:15] <Azathoth> NO WHAT IS THAT
[12:15] <Azathoth> !!
[12:16] <vurtual> I'm not "looking for them"
[12:16] <vurtual> I just listen to a random song in the soundtrack
[12:16] <eritz> http://thetvdb.com/?tab=series&id=81037&lid=7
[12:16] <vurtual> and go "wait wait wait, I KNOW THIS TUNE."
[12:16] <Speljohan_> aaaahhhhhhh anime
[12:16] <Speljohan_> die die die die die die
[12:16] <vurtual> Then shuffle through the various tracks in the game I'm thinking of, and BOOM, there it is
[12:16] <eritz> it's quite possibly the most solid anime show of the last five years
[12:16] <Speljohan_> i dislike anime artstyle so much
[12:16] <Azathoth> hmm
[12:17] <Azathoth> i can't even view that page
[12:17] <vurtual> this is a bit like doom and various other songs.
[12:17] <Azathoth> despite temporarily allowing everything on it in noscript
[12:17] <eritz> look at your URL bar
[12:17] <vurtual> only noobs use noscript
[12:17] <eritz> it's a static nojava page
[12:17] <Speljohan_> uhh..
[12:17] <Speljohan_> that doesn't make any sense
[12:17] <eritz> click my link again while everything is temporarily enabled
[12:17] <Speljohan_> javascript can be embedded into website
[12:17] <Azathoth> wow this anime looks gay
[12:18] <vurtual> whyyyy
[12:18] <Speljohan_> doesn't have to use the url in any way
[12:18] <eritz> it's not
[12:18] <vurtual> whyyy does this keep popping up
[12:18] <vurtual> I think about it for an hour, then generally ignore it, but then it HAPPENS AGAIN.
[12:18] <Azathoth> that's what she said
[12:18] <Azathoth> or... he
[12:18] <eritz> that's the thing, speljohan, there's a static page that you get redirected to when you do not have java, to tell you to enable it
[12:18] <eritz> that's what azathoth hit
[12:18] <Azathoth> yeah, got it
[12:18] <Speljohan_> ps stop saying java eritz please
[12:18] <Speljohan_> java != javascript
[12:19] <Azathoth> fuckin java
[12:19] <eritz> should i start saying "Gnu Plus Linux" while i'm at it?
[12:19] <Azathoth> how does it work?

[12:20] <Azathoth> which is one of the few anime series i've ever liked

[12:24] <Azathoth> it would probably be pretty hard though
[12:24] <Speljohan_> probably not
[12:24] <Azathoth> you'd have to have lighting from a specific direction
[12:24] <Speljohan_> hm, true
[12:24] <Azathoth> or else parts in shadow would look really deep
[12:25] <Azathoth> either that or as uniform of lighting as possible
[12:25] <Speljohan_> omg just got a cool idea
[12:25] <Speljohan_> just gotta make sure it works this easily
[12:25] <Azathoth> ok
[12:25] <Azathoth> gonna tell it?
[12:25] <Speljohan_> basically, toggle between 2d and 3d mode in my smb game instantly
[12:26] <Azathoth> 3d mode?
[12:26] <Speljohan_> i think all i have to do is change to an ortho projection
[12:26] <Speljohan_> to make it 2d
[12:26] <Azathoth> FPS MODE?!
[12:26] <vurtual> super paper mario, Speljohan_.

[12:26] <Azathoth> i see
[12:26] <Speljohan_> but i need to check if i can make it 2d on the fly
[12:26] <Azathoth> you should make it an FPS
[12:26] <vurtual> does mario get a rocket launcher?
[12:26] <Speljohan_> nothx
[12:26] <Speljohan_> it's an smb clone
[12:26] <Speljohan_> but with map editor

[12:29] <Speljohan_> to make transition smooth
[12:29] <Speljohan_> :>
[12:29] <Azathoth> (jk. i didn't actually say it would)
[12:29] <vurtual> if you have lua, 99% chance someoen will try to do a super mario crossoverm od

[12:29] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:30] <Speljohan_> i don't intend to make the scripting that elaborate
[12:30] <vurtual> how many different links could someone make?
[12:30] <Speljohan_> not for starters at least
[12:30] <vurtual> You don't have to make it elaborate, but you can make it powerful.

[12:33] <Speljohan_> i can probably add it in later without much trouble
[12:33] <Azathoth> the ability to replce vurtual with someone interesting would be awesome
[12:33] <Speljohan_> owned
[12:34] <Azathoth> :D
[12:34] <vurtual> I could change my name, and talk a bit differently, and you'd never know, Azathoth.

[12:36] <Bodie> i got back on the train, went to my car
[12:36] <Bodie> opened the door
[12:36] <Bodie> and it exploded out the exhaust
[12:36] <vurtual> why are all hl1 songs a direct object and noun
[12:36] <vurtual> maybe an adjective
[12:36] <Azathoth> because
[12:37] <Bodie> apparently static electricity + some fuel in the exhaust somehow
[12:37] <Azathoth> wait, i'm gone
[12:37] <Azathoth> ><
[12:37] <Speljohan_> because ur face is a noun
[12:37] <vurtual> adrenaline guitar, nuclear mission jam, dimensionless deepness, military precision
[12:37] <vurtual> klaxon beat, adrenaline horror,
[12:37] <Azathoth> klaxon is a noun
[12:37] <Azathoth> jus sayin
[12:37] <vurtual> NOT IF IT'S A DIRECT OBJECT
[12:37] <vurtual> BECAUSE THAT'S A NOUN TOO
[12:38] <Speljohan_> ur face is a direct object

[12:39] <Speljohan_> fff i want my boombox here so much.................
[12:40] <Speljohan_> perfect beer in the sun day :'(
[12:40] <vurtual> I feel like playing minecraft, but there're no decent servers
[12:40] <liq3> Speljohan_: hey
[12:40] <vurtual> and the desegnated server machine is currently downstairs.
[12:41] <Speljohan_> sup liq3
[12:41] <liq3> fine.
[12:41] <liq3> How's that project of yours? :P
[12:41] <Speljohan_> doin' well
[12:41] <vurtual> also on another note.
[12:41] <vurtual> Klaxon Beat from half-life appeared in some random stupid commercial.
[12:41] <vurtual> though, that is at least partially another song
[12:41] <Speljohan_> but i do no want to touch it at all due to awesome weather liq3
[12:41] <Speljohan_> :/
[12:42] <liq3> haha.
[12:42] <vurtual> no wait klaxon beat is not
[12:42] <vurtual> CONTINUE CONSPIRACY THEORY
[12:43] <Speljohan_> external soundcard + laptop + headphones at library = all well if weather is shit
[12:43] <Speljohan_> but this is not the case
[12:43] <Speljohan_> :(
[12:43] <vurtual> http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=VurtualRuler98 something seems different
[12:43] <vurtual> I'm going to keep blue-ifying my skin and seeing random people's reactions.

[12:47] <kwerty> I wish I could live the summer of 2008 again :/
[12:47] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:47] <Speljohan_> i want last summer back because it was the first summer i could afford having real fun
[12:48] <Speljohan_> 3 festivals + drunk almost constantly for 4 months <3
[12:48] <liq3> Weak.
[12:49] <Speljohan_> + lots and lots of hot german females :>
[12:49] <vurtual> Summer has rarely been that notable for me
[12:49] <vurtual> Sure, I get to be outside
[12:49] <vurtual> but I always am capible of being outside!
[12:49] <vurtual> barefoot sprinting in the cold snow, between the various patches of thick woods, in the dead of winter is really awesome, once you get tough enough for it
[12:49] <Speljohan_> i am pretty much bored the rest of the year
[12:50] <vurtual> come outside with me.
[12:50] <Speljohan_> summer festivals are my only highlight
[12:50] <vurtual> infact all year I'm just going to keep hardening myself.
[12:50] <Speljohan_> and the occasional winter inside-festival
[12:50] <vurtual> until I can handle any kind of weather
[12:50] <kwerty> vurtual: For what?
[12:50] <vurtual> for because I can
[12:50] <vurtual> ignore the fact that ninja warrior inspired me to become proficient at chinups with my fingertips.
[12:50] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:51] <kwerty> You watch too much anime and/or movies
[12:51] <Speljohan_> shame this summer won't be nearly as much fun as my previous one
[12:51] <Speljohan_> only 1 festival
[12:51] <Speljohan_> :cry:
[12:51] <kwerty> What's so special about festivals?
[12:52] <kwerty> Sure they are nice but I'd rather grab a couple of friends and go outside
[12:52] <Speljohan_> being drunk with people who share my musical taste kwerty !
[12:52] <vurtual> no no, it's a thing. It's a show called ninja warrior in the US.
[12:52] <vurtual> basically the most sadistically hard obstacle course
[12:52] <vurtual> the only prize is victory
[12:52] <vurtual> Two people, ever, have completed all the obstacles.
[12:52] <vurtual> Two.
[12:53] <kwerty> They must be the two most awesome persons ever
[12:53] <Speljohan_> i'm totally going to build a time-machine and go back to the 80's. Then i shall relive t for the rest of my life
[12:53] <vurtual> since 1997
[12:53] <vurtual> One of them was incredibly hardcore tough
[12:53] <vurtual> the other would be gone all year, as a fishing boat captain. He would do chinups and other forms of physical workout nonstop on the high beams of the boat.
[12:54] <vurtual> none of them have done it more than once, that I remember
[12:54] <kwerty> I've spent a week outside in -35C temperature and it was just shit. Enough hardening for me
[12:54] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:54] <Speljohan_> cold weather sucks
[12:54] <Speljohan_> at least when it is warm you can use a fan
[12:55] <vurtual> kwerty, barefoot?
[12:55] <vurtual> in the vast expanse of trees and snow
[12:55] <kwerty> Of course not. 20 mins barefoot in there and you'd get your foot cut off
[12:55] <kwerty> plenty of trees and snow, though
[12:56] <vurtual> not if your body is a raging inferno
[12:57] <kwerty> http://tietokannat.mil.fi/aapa09/include/thumbnail.php?id=65&width=640 Enough of trees and shit?
[12:57] <vurtual> cold can't catch you if you're ON FIRE.
[12:58] <vurtual> STOP DROP AND GIVE ME 20, MAGGOT

[13:09] <vurtual> before I begin to contemplate the fact that I sleep 10 exhausting hours.
[13:10] <Yourself> <Speljohan_> god invented man
[13:11] <Yourself> totally needs to learn to separate the feeding and breathing tubes
[13:11] <Dommys> saywha
[13:12] <eritz> i love all the people who, with all seriousness, point to the human body as an example of something so perfect, a god must have had something to do with its creation
[13:12] <Speljohan_> :D Yourself
[13:12] <eritz> it isn't perfect, fuckwits, it breaks ALL THE TIME
[13:12] <Yourself> eritz: testicles, end of story
[13:12] <Speljohan_> testicles is a cruel joke
[13:12] <Speljohan_> exposed vulnerable parts of your body
[13:13] <Dommys> You can live without them
[13:13] <Dommys> I do it all the time.
[13:13] <Yourself> you can't make more people without them
[13:13] <Dommys> I don't like "more people"
[13:13] <Dommys> I like "no people"
[13:13] <Speljohan_> life would sure as hell be much better without them
[13:13] <eritz> dumb-ass extinctionist
[13:13] <Yourself> life would be better if sperm could be produced at a slightly higher temperature
[13:13] <Yourself> or if your body turned the damn thermostat down a few degrees
[13:14] <Speljohan_> life would be better if we weren't so easily seduced by sexual needs
[13:14] <Speljohan_> DAMN YOU NATURE
[13:14] <eritz> it's best to set aside time to deal with one's sexuality, on a regular basis
[13:14] <eritz> so it doesn't hound you in your daily life
[13:14] <Speljohan_> irregular basis for me
[13:15] <Speljohan_> the only time i ever have sex is during festivals pretty much
[13:15] <Speljohan_> because know i won't have to meet the damn woman again
[13:15] <Dommys> Are you saying masturbation is the cure to sexual frustration?
[13:15] <Speljohan_> eg it won't interrupt my everyday life
[13:15] <Speljohan_> like females always do
[13:15] <Dommys> Unless she gets pregnant, and tracks you down.
[13:15] <Dommys> Enjoy that interruption. lol
[13:16] <Speljohan_> that would suck
[13:16] <Speljohan_> massively
[13:16] <Speljohan_> but it wouldn't happen
[13:16] <Speljohan_> speaking of festivals and sex, my mate got owned last year
[13:16] <Cintiq> THAT'S OFF
[13:16] <Speljohan_> first night, he bangs some chick without knowing she was having her period
[13:16] <Cintiq> odd* lolcaps
[13:16] <Dommys> Unless you have no reproductive glands, I wouldn't be so certain :D
[13:16] <Cintiq> oh man
[13:16] <Speljohan_> and wakes up with blood all over his pants
[13:16] <Speljohan_> lolol
[13:16] <Cintiq> did i just join at the perfect time
[13:17] <vurtual> yes you did
[13:17] <Speljohan_> indeed you did
[13:17] <Speljohan_> Dommys there's a reason for condoms uno

[13:22] <eritz> pretty good
[13:22] <Speljohan_> it's funny cus he got such a low fine
[13:23] <eritz> reminds me of the time some teenager stole a bus while the driver was away... and proceeded to take the bus along its route, just like the driver would
[13:27] <eritz> so, i went with my dad to the unemployment office not too long ago
[13:28] <eritz> he mentioned something about being given some kind of secret word to use as a password

[13:35] <Sa[i]nT> There is a torrent of 5 gigs of math books.
[13:36] <Sa[i]nT> textbooks are easy as hell to get.
[13:36] <eritz> the main difficult thing is, it's hard to tell what's what
[13:36] <Yourself> textbooks aren't a particularly good source by themselves
[13:36] <eritz> yeah...
[13:36] <Sa[i]nT> Teach yourself.
[13:36] <Yourself> and when you get to the really high level shit you run out of books and have to rely on journal papers
[13:36] <Yourself> and those are even worse
[13:37] <eritz> no, i mean, it's hard to know what book starts where
[13:37] <Sa[i]nT> If it looks hard back off and if it looks easy advance.
[13:37] <Sa[i]nT> Not rocket science.
[13:37] <eritz> and, as Yourself points out, books aren't even particularly good at teaching math
[13:37] <Sa[i]nT> Programming teaches math. I suggest you pick out a language and go with it.
[13:38] <eritz> i'm not really wanting to learn more about math at the moment

[13:40] <eritz> on the instrument, and quality thereof
[13:40] <Speljohan_> you can get cheap stuff too
[13:40] <Sa[i]nT> Get a computer hobby, it's rewarding to build a massive program and it compile and work right.
[13:40] <Sa[i]nT> And at the possibilites of complete control of the machine.
[13:40] <eritz> computers already are my hobby, they have been for a long time
[13:40] <eritz> i'd like to do something different for a while
[13:40] <Speljohan_> it's not rewarding to see something compile. If it doesn't you are not doing it right
[13:40] <Speljohan_> !
[13:41] <Speljohan_> i've been playing guitar for about 10 yrs now eritz
[13:41] <Speljohan_> very rewarding
[13:41] <Sa[i]nT> LoL.
[13:41] <eritz> not sure guitar would quite be for me

[13:44] <Siiseli> I also like c# for small projects
[13:44] <kwerty> I made some shitty text adventure with Qbasic, does that count?
[13:44] <Sa[i]nT> I need to call upon the great GUI gods once more.
[13:44] <Yourself> real men program in brainfuck
[13:45] <Yourself> did i say men?
[13:45] <Speljohan_> brainfuck is too easy
[13:45] <Yourself> i meant psychopaths
[13:45] <Speljohan_> malbolge is where it's at mate
[13:45] <Sa[i]nT> C++, period.
[13:45] <Sa[i]nT> And been playing around with C++0x too.
[13:45] <Sa[i]nT> The nextone.
[13:45] <Speljohan_> we are being sarcastic Sa[i]nT
[13:45] <Yourself> yes, we know what C++0x is
[13:46] <Speljohan_> ^
[13:46] <Sa[i]nT> LoL.
[13:46] <kwerty> What's the difference between C, C++ and C#?
[13:46] <Sa[i]nT> Good for you then.

[13:46] <Sa[i]nT> Been looking for a group to watch talk about programming.
[13:46] * Yourself (yourself@c-98-228-139-130.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:46] <Yourself> irc is fail
[13:46] <Speljohan_> this isn't your home then Sa[i]nT
[13:47] <Sa[i]nT> I figured.
[13:47] <Shadaez> nerds.
[13:47] <Sa[i]nT> Mostly mundance conversations about nothing.
[13:47] <Sa[i]nT> No imagination anymore.
[13:47] <Speljohan_> imagination is overrated
[13:47] <eritz> imagination can be found in the most unlikely of places
[13:47] <Sa[i]nT> You guys could be creating stuff, but nahh.
[13:47] <Yourself> mostly in your ass
[13:48] <Speljohan_> i am creating stuff Sa[i]nT
[13:48] <vurtual> I think
[13:48] <vurtual> I'm ocnfusec
[13:48] <vurtual> I was trying to read tvtropes
[13:48] <kwerty> can i eating water pvp?
[13:48] <Yourself> my job is to create stuff
[13:48] <Rithiur> Considering how many good ideas are made up in toilets, ass is indeed one of the most wonderful sources of imegination.
[13:48] <vurtual> and then suddenly, boom.
[13:48] <Yourself> i've had enough of it
[13:48] <vurtual> ALL MY TVTROPES TABS ARE GONE
[13:48] <eritz> notice that we're in the IRC channel for minecraft, a game where one of the fundamental mechanics is creating things
[13:48] <eritz> it's even in the name
[13:48] <eritz> mineCRAFT
[13:48] <Shadaez> wtf is TVTropes
[13:48] <eritz> don't even ask
[13:48] <eritz> run while you can
[13:49] <Yourself> Shadaez, an amazing time sink
[13:49] <Rithiur> Shadaez: You don't want to know.
[13:49] <Shadaez> it looks ery dumb
[13:49] <Sa[i]nT> I just joined the room cuz there was a lot of people in here.
[13:49] <Yourself> the most accurate description would be a black hole of ADD
[13:49] <Sa[i]nT> I like watching people talk, no harm in knowing more.
[13:49] <eritz> wait... vurtual... were you still troping from my Xanatos Gambit link?
[13:49] <Yourself> TVTropes is digital crack
[13:50] <Yourself> you look at it and think "why would anyone do this?"
[13:50] <Sa[i]nT> So, do you guys work on this game? Or is this like a wow thing.
[13:51] <Yourself> next thing you know you haven't slept for 84 hours and you're reading about a tv show you used to watch as a child
[13:51] <eritz> minecraft only has one coder
[13:51] <eritz> and he's not here right now
[13:51] <Sa[i]nT> Geeze.
[13:51] <eritz> there are definitely people who'd help him, but he prefers going solo
[13:51] <Speljohan_> i do not think anyone here is collaborating with anyone
[13:51] <Sa[i]nT> Doesnt he want people to help.
[13:51] <eritz> no
[13:51] <Yourself> no
[13:51] <Speljohan_> help is a burden
[13:51] <Speljohan_> working alone is way better
[13:51] <Sa[i]nT> There is always someone better.
[13:51] <Speljohan_> that's not the point
[13:52] <Sa[i]nT> That seems alittle arrogant.
[13:52] <Yourself> but that someone doesn't share your opinions for what the game should be
[13:52] <eritz> but he feels that the best way to keep minecraft going in the direction he wants it to is to go solo
[13:52] <eritz> creative differences can mess with a project pretty bad
[13:52] <Shadaez> I was just there, on TVTropes, and it was dumb, still
[13:52] <Speljohan_> the coordination required to have multiple people working on the same project can be quite a lot of work
[13:52] <Sa[i]nT> Yeah, but what can he do by himself, he is just hindering himself. This must be a simple game.
[13:52] <Speljohan_> uhh
[13:52] <eritz> actually, so far, he's done everything you currently see by himself
[13:52] <vurtual> no, eritz
[13:52] <Speljohan_> what Sa[i]nT
[13:52] <vurtual> different link
[13:52] <Speljohan_> you can do anything yourself
[13:52] <eritz> well, almost everything
[13:53] <Speljohan_> it just takes longer
[13:53] <vurtual> from hours before
[13:53] <Yourself> eritz, i don't think he's seen anything
[13:53] <eritz> would make sense
[13:53] <vurtual> I have very little to do
[13:53] <eritz> i suppose
[13:53] <Yourself> <Sa[i]nT> I just joined the room cuz there was a lot of people in here.
[13:53] <eritz> go play minecraft, Sa[i]nT, and witness what notch has done 'by himself'
[13:53] <Yourself> he won't see infdev, so it doesn't really matter
[13:53] <Sa[i]nT> Well, I could help without changing the flow of the game. For the hell of doing it.
[13:53] <kwerty> And buy it!
[13:53] <kwerty> Do eet!
[13:54] <Speljohan_> or you could just create your own project Sa[i]nT
[13:54] <Sa[i]nT> omg.
[13:54] <eritz> incidentally, yeah, minecraft is like $14 USD, quite worth it
[13:54] <Sa[i]nT> It's a commercial game.
[13:54] <Speljohan_> noshit
[13:54] <Sa[i]nT> That's funny.
[13:54] <Shadaez> why?
[13:54] <kwerty> How is that funny?
[13:54] <Speljohan_> how else do you expect mr notch to survive?
[13:54] <Speljohan_> it's his livelyhood
[13:54] <eritz> notch is working on minecraft full-time, starting in june
[13:55] <Yourself> i confess, a pigeonhole began to form
[13:55] <Sa[i]nT> What is it written in, java?
[13:55] <Speljohan_> yes
[13:55] <eritz> what matters isn't what it's written in, what matters is that it's fun
[13:55] <Speljohan_> ^
[13:55] <eritz> and the developer cares about the game, a lot
[13:55] <eritz> and listens to what the people here in the channel say
[13:56] <Sa[i]nT> Well, I'm a developer, I am only curious.
[13:56] <Speljohan_> that's the advantage of indie gaming
[13:56] <Speljohan_> you can reach out to people easier
[13:56] <eritz> hell, i've personally requested features that have gone into the game
[13:56] <Speljohan_> because you don't have people dictating you
[13:56] <kwerty> And developers actually care about players
[13:57] <Sa[i]nT> Yeah.
[13:57] <Sa[i]nT> I know the drill.
[13:58] <Yourself> there are no drills in minecraft
[13:58] <eritz> only pickaxes
[13:58] <Yourself> there's no crying in baseball
[13:58] <eritz> although, perhaps there should be drills
[13:58] <Speljohan_> ur face should be drilled
[13:59] <Sa[i]nT> He shouldnt be all closed-source about it, imagine what people could bring to the game. Even if it had like a plugin interface.
[13:59] <Speljohan_> he wouldn't make any money then
[13:59] <Speljohan_> well, he probably would
[13:59] <Yourself> he can be whatever he wants to be about it
[13:59] <Sa[i]nT> The game would still be there.
[13:59] <Speljohan_> but not nearly as much
[13:59] <Budda> once you go open source, people just take it, edit it a bit and call it their own
[13:59] <eritz> a plugin interface may well be coming
[13:59] <Sa[i]nT> Not completely open-source.
[13:59] <eritz> but, as it stands now, the game doesn't even have a client
[13:59] * Moocmans-Alt (Max_Bo@140.a.001.gld.iprimus.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[14:00] <Speljohan_> getting an open source project profitable is quite hard
[14:00] <Speljohan_> i managed to do it once
[14:00] <eritz> the game is still in alpha
[14:00] <Sa[i]nT> Just add a way to allow submission of plugins.
[14:00] <Yourself> a plugin interface for the server better damn well be coming
[14:00] <Speljohan_> uhh what Eric
[14:00] <Speljohan_> eritz*
[14:00] <Speljohan_> that makes no sense
[14:00] <Speljohan_> <eritz> but, as it stands now, the game doesn't even have a client
[14:00] <eritz> it doesn't
[14:00] <Speljohan_> the java applet is a client
[14:00] <Budda> yes it does...
[14:00] <Speljohan_> ..
[14:00] <kwerty> How do you play it without a client?
[14:00] <eritz> i mean a CLIENT client
[14:00] <Speljohan_> ^
[14:00] <Shadaez> he's going to, he plans on having Lua or Python stuff.
[14:00] <eritz> not a web-based interface
[14:00] <Speljohan_> what eritz
[14:00] <Budda> it is a CLIENT client
[14:00] <GoaLitiuM> eritz: standalone client
[14:00] <Sa[i]nT> Like a desktop based client?
[14:00] <eritz> yes
[14:01] <eritz> fucking thank you
[14:01] <Speljohan_> standalone client is easy to add though
[14:01] <eritz> bunch of dense sons of bitches
[14:01] <Sa[i]nT> Java -can- have a desktop client.
[14:01] <Speljohan_> it would probably take notch about 5 minutes to make it a desktop client
[14:01] <Sa[i]nT> BUT, it is always hindered by the virtual machine.
[14:01] <Speljohan_> probably less
[14:01] <kwerty> If you don't like running it in a browser try the client at WoM?
[14:01] <eritz> WoM is so imperfect
[14:01] * TVC (TVC@115-64-85-159.static.tpgi.com.au) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[14:01] <kwerty> Still the same thing
[14:01] <GoaLitiuM> wtf, it's standalone client, not desktop client
[14:01] <eritz> no it isn't
[14:01] <Speljohan_> just write your own classloader for it
[14:02] <Speljohan_> have it download the latest jar from server
[14:02] <Speljohan_> load it into a java container
[14:02] <Speljohan_> and an applet stub
[14:02] <Speljohan_> bam done
[14:02] <GoaLitiuM> is there laptop clients too? or what if the client is inside folder, not in desktop
[14:02] <eritz> that's great, except, since it isn't an official desktop client, it's moot
[14:02] <Sa[i]nT> What are you talking about, desktop side and browser side.
[14:02] <Speljohan_> correct
[14:02] <Speljohan_> uhh
[14:02] <eritz> since it doesn't have any of the officially-supported features that an official desktop client would have
[14:02] <Sa[i]nT> You dont have to get all script kiddie on me.
[14:02] <Speljohan_> "desktop side" and "browser side" are the same thing
[14:03] <Speljohan_> both are ran on your pc
[14:03] <Cintiq> oh man
[14:03] <Yourself> this is boring

[14:03] <Budda> wat
[14:03] <Speljohan_> i doubt a desktop client would differ at all in gameplay
[14:03] <Speljohan_> whatsoever
[14:03] <Budda> if notch gave us an 'official deskyop client' it would be exactly the same as the web one
[14:03] <eritz> an official desktop client, when it is released, would likely have more options

[14:03] <Budda> it wont

[14:04] <Yourself> the fuck
[14:04] <Budda> im like, 10x facepalming right now
[14:05] <Sa[i]nT> Should be torn down and built back up with a compiled language.
[14:05] <Speljohan_> uhhhh
[14:05] <Speljohan_> 100x facepalm now
[14:05] <Budda> ye
[14:05] <Budda> hurr durr java doesnt compile herp
[14:05] <Yourself> the vm isn't the bottleneck, so that'd be a waste of time

[14:06] <Sa[i]nT> Everything down to the sockets would be better built and created for more specific tasks. Java is a buffet of generalization.
[14:06] <kwerty> You should not play it if Java is such a problem for you
[14:07] <Speljohan_> but then, why the fuck would you want a general purpose language to perform "specific tasks"?
[14:07] <Budda> GUYS JAVA IS SLOW, WHAT TAKES 8MS TO DO IN C++ TAKES 10MS IN JAVA, NOBODY SHOULD EVER USE IT AGAIN!!!!!
[14:07] <Speljohan_> that's a vast generalization though Budda
[14:07] <Sa[i]nT> >.>
[14:07] <Rithiur> Actualy
[14:07] <Budda> no shit
[14:07] <Speljohan_> it all depends on the task
[14:07] <Rithiur> *Actually, 25% slower is quite a bit.
[14:07] <Speljohan_> some tasks are fast, some are slow
[14:07] <kwerty> Get a new computer if your shit pc can't run java :(
[14:07] <Speljohan_> for instance, jni is pretty slow
[14:07] <Speljohan_> and should be faster
[14:08] <Sa[i]nT> The fact of it is not that they can echo something relativly close, but when you got a shitload of threads running and something slows up. It can lag the whole program.
[14:08] <Speljohan_> ........
[14:08] <Speljohan_> 1000x facepalm
[14:08] * Budda activates the douche alarm
[14:09] <Sa[i]nT> Assuming that your actually letting the threads interact with each other. And not just roll dice.
[14:09] <Sa[i]nT> I bet it's source is like biting into a fresh apple.
[14:10] <kwerty> It's still fun to play
[14:10] <Sa[i]nT> I'm not dissing it at all. Just being curious.

[14:11] <Speljohan_> too bad
[14:11] <Speljohan_> :(
[14:12] <Yourself> anyway, just to spell it out completely for anyone who hasn't been keeping up
[14:12] <Yourself> Sa[i]nT, here, joined the channel because it had a lot of people in it
[14:13] <Yourself> generally had no idea what the channel was for and didn't know anything about minecraft
[14:13] <Yourself> and is now explaining to the rest of us what needs to be changed about it
[14:13] <Sa[i]nT> I was just speculating man.
[14:14] <Sa[i]nT> I'm a worker bee, ya know. Always looking for projects.
[14:15] <Yourself> do a little research next time, then
[14:15] <sppt> wait wut

[14:15] <sppt> wuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut
[14:15] <Shadaez> latex1
[14:15] <Sa[i]nT> I never once criticized the game it's self. Just the language it was written in.
[14:16] <sppt> oh, i bet you gotta use the xfire web toolbar
[14:16] <Sa[i]nT> Never once said the game was badly written or poorly designed in any way.
[14:16] <Yourself> no one said you were criticizing the game
[14:16] <Sa[i]nT> I am only interested in the language and the mechanics.
[14:17] <Sa[i]nT> This is my hobby, I am rather good at it. I specialize in sockets and object driven coding.

[14:19] <Yourself> anyway, no
[14:19] <slowriot> i ask this daily
[14:19] <Yourself> he's on a break until june
[14:19] <Yourself> stop asking
[14:19] <slowriot> notch is such a cuuuuuuunt!!
[14:19] <slowriot> i won't stop
[14:19] <slowriot> if i don't put the pressure on, none of you pussies will

[14:20] <Yourself> he's on a break until june because of pressure
[14:20] <slowriot> well fact is, nobody has forced him into this position
[14:20] <Yourself> what makes you think that adding more pressure will fix that?
[14:20] <slowriot> and i am perfectly happy to concede that just because we paid him for his game doesn't give us the right to tell him what to do
[14:21] <slowriot> and in equal balance to that, whether or not we paid for his game, the fact he put himself in a position to receive community opinion, means that we have the right to tell him to hurry up if we want
[14:21] <slowriot> he can just ignore us

[14:22] <Speljohan_> no u
[14:22] <slowriot> but still, i choose to come on every day and ask if he's updated yet, partly in the hope that he might have, and partly to stir up a reminder for folks that they have the right to pester regardless of whether he says to shoo or not
[14:22] <slowriot> just as much as he has the right to tell us to stfu until he's finished fallout 3 and all his other games he bought with our cash
[14:23] <slowriot> fair's fair
[14:23] <kwerty> Couldn't you just follow the updates on the site?
[14:23] <slowriot> this channel would be mighty boring then
[14:23] <Yourself> he could, but that would be far less annoying and make far more sense
[14:23] <slowriot> oh but the sheer disappointment of seeing no new blog posts
[14:24] <slowriot> anyway, i already explained - my point is to stir up a dialogue, which i seem to have done
[14:24] <Rithiur> But not all dialogue are equal.
[14:24] <bildramer> :l
[14:24] <slowriot> oh by the way, could i ask you guys to go through an example with me?
[14:24] <bildramer> ?
[14:25] <slowriot> not cos i'm trying to prove a point, but i'm quite curious to see if our opinions converge
[14:25] <slowriot> imagine you are in the market for a supercar

[14:26] <slowriot> so you've put down a deposit
[14:26] <bildramer> wtf is this shit
[14:26] <bildramer> where do the dots go
[14:26] <Shadaez> bildramer that isn't going to scare me is it
[14:26] <slowriot> and i've told you the car will be two months to be delivered
[14:27] <Shadaez> ill freak out
[14:27] <slowriot> and you've been taken for a test drive in a demonstrator etc
[14:27] <slowriot> so you've had a taste of it
[14:27] <slowriot> but then two months are up, and i tell you that i'm going to spend some of that time cruising on a yacht i've bought with some of your money because i need a break before i finish the car
[14:27] <slowriot> but i assure you the car will be better built etc when i get back than it otherwise would have, and so on
[14:28] <slowriot> wouldn't the first thing you ask be: why wouldn't it be built as well as it could anyhow?
[14:28] <Yourself> slowriot, that's not even the same and you know it
[14:28] <Shadaez> no it's more like you're an idiot and assumed something and were wrong and now you're acting like a child

[14:29] <slowriot> so you'd be happy waiting another month, knowing the car guy is on a nice cruise with lots of cocktails and women and that when he gets back he'll be happy to get on with your car with renewed vigor?

[16:25] <Dommys> http://fatpita.net/?i=5402
[16:26] <Snowman> Cuase they're stupid
[16:26] <Snowman> Why not eat meat?
[16:26] <Shadaez> because there's perfectly good substitutes that taste fine and don't require killing anything
[16:27] <Shadaez> plus im sure it requires less total food to make
[16:27] <Dommys> I don't believe that.
[16:27] <Dommys> I've tried soy products, and they do NOT taste like the food they're being subbed for
[16:27] <Snowman> HURR
[16:27] <Snowman> Like killing things isn't natural
[16:27] <Shadaez> what brand?
[16:27] <Snowman> ANd meat is tasty
[16:27] <Dommys> All fucking sorts of brands
[16:27] <Shadaez> doubtful
[16:27] <Dommys> Fuck you
[16:27] <Shadaez> unless you have a veggie friend
[16:28] <Dommys> no, shut the fuck up
[16:28] <Shadaez> why else would you try them all?
[16:28] <Dommys> You don't fucking ask a question and then say doubtful to the answer.
[16:28] <Dommys> I've tried tons of vegetarian shit, and it all tasted bland, or had a weird consistency.
[16:28] <Shadaez> just wondering why you would try them
[16:28] <Dommys> Why? because my doctor said to. so I did.
[16:29] <Dommys> And not only did they mostly taste "off"
[16:29] <Dommys> But they were more expensive.
[16:29] <Shadaez> yeah, sometimes
[16:29] <Snowman> Anyway, vegetables don't contain any/enough of the nutrients you need
[16:29] <Shadaez> yeah they do
[16:29] <Dommys> So look, if you've got the money to buy that shit, and the will power to pretend that it tastes the same or better, go for it.
[16:29] <Dommys> But don't lie to us about it. lol
[16:30] <Snowman> Proteins
[16:30] <Snowman> You need to eat a fuckton of vegetables to get enough
[16:30] <Shadaez> soy is a complete protein
[16:30] <Dommys> You can obtain the amount of protein your body needs from non meat sources just as easy
[16:30] <Dommys> That's not the issue
[16:30] <Shadaez> thanks

[16:31] <Dommys> I'm not biased to the fact that some people can exist on that food.
[16:31] <Dommys> I just know that I cannot.
[16:31] <Shadaez> have you tried morningstar?
[16:31] <Sa[i]nT> I love this plane of existence.
[16:31] <Dommys> And I've had so many doctors tell me that shit.
[16:31] <Dommys> yes
[16:31] <Dommys> Walmart sells it
[16:31] <Dommys> I bought a weeks worth of their stuff
[16:31] <Shadaez> i thought it was good
[16:31] <Dommys> I made it 3 days in
[16:31] <Dommys> And gave the rest to my sister who eats it on and off.
[16:32] <Dommys> Eating that stuff, to me, It just feels like all I can taste is the condiments I have to put on it
[16:32] <Dommys> I did soy milk, that wasn't terrible.
[16:32] <Shadaez> i love chocolate silk
[16:33] <Dommys> But I get slight issues with dairy
[16:33] <Dommys> So, it had a benefit
[16:33] <Dommys> It's not JUST LIKE MILK
[16:33] <Dommys> but it's kinda close.
[16:33] <Shadaez> you can get some vegetarian stuff for cheaper than the real thing, if you know hwat you're doing, though
[16:33] <Shadaez> like chili
[16:33] <Snowman> Nothing can replace a nice, tender, juicy steak
[16:33] <Dommys> I don't like Grained beef.. lol

[16:34] <Shadaez> but you need to realize that Nachos are vegetarian (lacto, at least)
[16:35] <Dommys> They make soy cheese.
[16:35] <Dommys> Chipotle uses it
[16:35] <Dommys> It's not terrible either.
[16:35] <Shadaez> chipotle?
[16:35] <Dommys> Soy dairy replacements work for me.. but the rest.
[16:35] <Dommys> It's a "fast food" chain

[16:36] <Shadaez> is that just a big burrito?
[16:37] <Dommys> lol.. It's like, a pound of burrito
[16:37] <Dommys> Yeah
[16:37] <Shadaez> oh yeah
[16:37] <Shadaez> they are awesome
[16:37] <Dommys> That's what Chipotle does
[16:37] <Shadaez> just make them at home, it's so cheap to make
[16:37] <Shadaez> rice and beans are like $1 a pound
[16:37] <Dommys> Chicken, Steak, Beef or Pork, Black beans, Lime Rice, Sea salt chips, Soy Sour Cream / Cheese
[16:37] <Dommys> I do make it at home
[16:38] <Dommys> I just eat it with chips instead of wraps
[16:38] <Dommys> But chipotle has a great spice blend :D
[16:38] <Dommys> And making quac sucks

[16:38] <Dommys> lol
[16:38] <Shadaez> did you try turtle rock stuff?
[16:39] <Shadaez> it's like the most expensive ones, they make Tofurky
[16:39] <Dommys> I've had tofurkey
[16:39] <Shadaez> turtle islands*
[16:39] <Dommys> Not sure if that was the brand, though

[16:40] <Dommys> My mother was trying to be a smartass a few years ago and made it for Thanksgiving, she left the turkey hidden and served that
[16:40] <Dommys> It wasn't terrible, really
[16:40] <Dommys> But I'm not a huge fan of turkey to begin with. lol
[16:40] <Shadaez> I have a turky log in the freezer
[16:41] <Shadaez> and 20 bags of faux meatballs
[16:41] <Shadaez> because they're so cheap at grocery outlet all the time
[16:42] <Shadaez> http://www.quorn.us/products/Turk'y_Roast.aspx turky log
[16:43] <Dommys> Walmart sells "Faux Meatballs"
[16:43] <Dommys> They kinda tasted more like Stuffing than meat
[16:44] <Shadaez> you need to brown them first or they're mushy
[16:45] <eritz> wouldn't surprise me if a lot of wal-mart's meat was 'faux', even the stuff that's not labeled as such
[16:45] <Shadaez> eritz a lot of chili's and ground meat stuffs has TVP in it to lower costs
[16:45] <Dommys> The only vegan dish I can actually say I really liked, my sister makes.. she makes rice noodles, and coats them in this sauce, it's like mostly sriraka (hot sauce) and peanut butter.. lol
[16:46] <Shadaez> you probably just don't know that some things are vegan when they are
[16:46] <Dommys> Either way, it tasted just like Pad Thai
[16:46] <eritz> honestly, there are some manufacturers that cheap out on their wal-mart goods, specifically, because wal-mart demands lower prices
[16:46] <Shadaez> i make peanut sauce, put it on some egg free noodles and it's vegan
[16:46] <Dommys> guess that's what it was supposed to be
[16:46] <eritz> so, remember, even if it has the same label, the same box, and the same model number, it may not be the same thing

[16:54] <Budda> Marach-17: like storing movies, games and tv shows?
[16:54] <Sa[i]nT> You cant like accidently fill up 100 gigs,so your just doing it to do it.
[16:54] <Dommys> I can
[16:54] <eritz> just my star trek rips take up 90 GB so far
[16:55] <Budda> Marach-17: no im not, but i keep things i have watched for other people to get off me

[16:57] <eritz> laughing_females.tiff
[16:57] <Marach-17> Shadaez: my point
[16:57] <Dommys> Marach-17 seriously, "YOU DONT NEED IT" so you're saying, hard drives shouldn't be made larger than 36gb because you do fuck all with your computer?
[16:57] <Marach-17> youtube has shit quality.
[16:58] <Snowman> 1080? Not bad quality imho
[16:58] <Budda> Marach-17, Shadaez: so you're saying taht you've NEVER EVER played something twice, or watched something twice?
[16:58] <Marach-17> Dommys: yeah go play your indev
[16:58] <Dommys> "yeah go play your indev" wtf kind of response is that?
[16:58] <Marach-17> Budda: i did, but with never in the same year

[16:59] <eritz> at the same time
[16:59] <Marach-17> so true :D
[16:59] <Dommys> So, downloading shit everytime someone wants to see it again
[16:59] <Marach-17> SOMEONE?
[16:59] <Budda> yes
[16:59] <Marach-17> how many people use your computer
[16:59] <eritz> and, like i said, there's the matter of people who torrent
[16:59] <Budda> like other people
[16:59] <Budda> aka friends
[17:00] <Dommys> Yeah, obviously, unlike you I have friends and family
[17:00] <eritz> people who torrent like to seed
[17:00] <Dommys> No one uses my computer but me.
[17:00] <eritz> people who seed need to keep files
[17:00] <Marach-17> eritz: i seed till at least 10.0 ratio
[17:00] <Dommys> But I do have an Xbox as media center Extender to the Television
[17:00] <Dommys> So other people watch
[17:00] <bildramer> dicks come in, shit comes out
[17:00] <Marach-17> i'm not going to talk to someone who has an xbox. now stfu
[17:00] <Budda> and people who go to LANs, like me, and aren't complete assholes, like to keep their files to help out others that may want them
[17:00] <Dommys> LOL.
[17:00] <eritz> nobody uses my computer but me... but my XBMC box that accesses network shares?
[17:00] <Dommys> Your argument fails
[17:01] <eritz> plenty of people use that
[17:01] <Dommys> But go ahead and blame it on me having an xbox
[17:01] <Budda> also yeah, i share all my shit for my flatmates to use
[17:01] <eritz> well, dommys, he has a point... you DO have an xbox
[17:01] <Dommys> And that obviously proves that No one on the planet needs more than 36gb, amirite?
[17:01] <bildramer> ...do trees grow in infdev?
[17:02] <eritz> i'm kidding, of course
[17:02] <Marach-17> don't blame me that you keep useless shit you don't even know about on your computer
[17:02] <Dommys> So am I, of course
[17:02] <Dommys> I know what I have on my hard drive.
[17:02] <Budda> Marach-17: I know about all of my useless shit
[17:02] <eritz> as do i
[17:02] <bildramer> I'm asking stuff about Minecraft
[17:02] <Marach-17> hm, actually i'd use like 5 gb more
[17:02] <Dommys> Just because you can't keep track of more than 10 mp3s doesn't mean I can't.
[17:02] * bildramer casts Enforce Internet Relay Chat Channel Rule
[17:02] <eritz> i don't know if trees grow in infdev
[17:02] <Marach-17> Dommys: i use grooveshark
[17:02] <bildramer> :|
[17:02] <Marach-17> and have an ipod touch
[17:02] <Budda> apple
[17:02] <eritz> hahahahahaha
[17:02] <Dommys> Exactly. You have to pay monthly for someone to MANAGE your songs for you
[17:02] <Budda> what a douche
[17:03] <eritz> you have an ipod
[17:03] <Marach-17> yeah, EVERYTHING ELSE broke in a week
[17:03] <Budda> you rag on him for having an xbox, when you have an ipod
[17:03] <Shadaez> eritz name a better MP3 player than an iPod?
[17:03] <Budda> rofl
[17:03] <Snowman> Xiron
[17:03] <eritz> the cowon S9
[17:03] <Dommys> i'm not going to talk to someone who has an ipod. now stfu
[17:03] <Dommys> :D
[17:03] <Marach-17> Dommys: i asked you first and you didn't listen
[17:03] <eritz> the sansa clip, too
[17:03] <Shadaez> never heard of it
[17:03] <eritz> that sounds like your problem, not mine
[17:03] <Dommys> You asked me first what?
[17:03] <Snowman> Creative
[17:03] <Marach-17> to stfu
[17:03] <Budda> Shadaez: there are a lot better, just you've never heard of any of them becuse apple shoved the ipod down everyones throat for the past 5 years
[17:04] <Dommys> I don't stfu, YOU stfu
[17:04] <Marach-17> i asked first
[17:04] <Dommys> ./kick Marach-17 #stfu
[17:04] <Budda> now everyone thinks ipods are the one and only
[17:04] <Shadaez> Budda I've heard of plenty
[17:04] <Marach-17> ipod touch is a better gaming platform than ds
[17:04] <Dommys> lol
[17:04] <eritz> i'm assuming, of course, that the ability of your MP3 player to fart on command does not factor in to your buying decision
[17:04] * Budda activates the douche alarm
[17:04] <eritz> if it does, then, by all means, buy an iPod Touch
[17:05] <Dommys> ^
[17:05] <Marach-17> now show me an mp3 player with a todo list
[17:05] <eritz> show me an MP3 player that needs one to play music
[17:05] <Shadaez> I think Zunes are better, but their software makes them worse, iPods are the best, currently. Show me a MP3 player with album art, tags, etc, properly,
[17:05] <Marach-17> synchronisable with toodledo
[17:05] <Budda> ALL MP3 PLAYERS NEED A TODO LIST, ITS NOT LIKE YOU BOUGHT IT TO PLAY MUSIC OR ANYTHING
[17:05] <Dommys> lol.
[17:05] <Marach-17> Budda: i did. my old ipod nano broke
[17:06] <Budda> /facepalm
[17:06] <Marach-17> i wish itunes wasn't a piece of shit :(
[17:06] <Dommys> My phone does all that and more
[17:06] <Marach-17> it would be perfect then
[17:06] <Marach-17> Dommys: loool phone
[17:06] <Dommys> And I don't have to deal with itunes/apple garbage
[17:06] <eritz> so, your apple product broke... and you bought another apple product?
[17:06] <Shadaez> the Cowon S9 looks pretty good
[17:06] <Budda> [01:06:26] <Marach-17> Dommys: loool phone
[17:06] <Budda> and if he said iPhone?
[17:06] <Budda> you'd be all over him
[17:06] <Dommys> Right
[17:06] <Marach-17> ALL CELLPHONES NEED AN MP3 PLAYER, ITS NOT LIKE YOU BOUGHT IT TO TALK OR ANYTHING
[17:07] <Dommys> He's using an iPhone-less
[17:07] <Budda> [01:06:05] <Budda> /facepalm
[17:07] <eritz> actually, even my phone has an MP3 player in it
[17:07] <eritz> i never use it, though
[17:07] <Dommys> Actually, marach
[17:07] <Dommys> I didn't buy my cellphone to talk
[17:07] <Dommys> I bought it to text
[17:07] <Dommys> It just happens to talk, and play music.
[17:07] <Dommys> And games, and movies
[17:07] <Marach-17> lool games
[17:07] <Marach-17> nes games are much better
[17:08] <Shadaez> you guys are dumb for apple bandwagoning for iPods, anyways
[17:08] <Marach-17> in fact there's a j2me nes emulator
[17:08] <Dommys> I play NES games on my phone niccuh
[17:08] <Marach-17> j4*
[17:08] <Marach-17> nvm*
[17:08] <Dommys> Seriously though, Marach
[17:08] <Dommys> Your argument is invalid.
[17:09] <Dommys> 36gb is not a "smart" limitation in modern computing
[17:09] <eritz> Dommys' hair is a bird.
[17:09] <Dommys> You're just either poor, or retarded.
[17:09] <Marach-17> poor
[17:09] <eritz> or some mix thereof
[17:09] <Shadaez> I have an 80 GB hdd just laying around
[17:09] <Marach-17> at least i learned to respect what i have
[17:09] <eritz> you're forgetting, dommys, that marach alleged that the iphone was a better gaming platform than the NDS
[17:10] <Dommys> "I can't afford 100 bucks to buy a replacement hard drive.. and since I get by, so should you."
[17:10] <eritz> and that is at least partially retarded
[17:10] * Moot (a@76.91.27.107) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[17:10] <Dommys> Marach you're retarded for sure.
[17:10] <Marach-17> none have any truly epic games (unlike ie. psp)
[17:10] <Shadaez> iPhone is a nice gaming platform
[17:10] * DimJim (chatzilla@cpe-24-242-36-94.hot.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: no)
[17:10] <eritz> if you like not having buttons
[17:10] <Shadaez> better than DS? IdK
[17:10] <eritz> buttonless interfaces can go fuck themselves
[17:10] <Shadaez> you don't need buttons
[17:10] <eritz> yes you do
[17:10] <Dommys> [09:09] <Marach-17> at least i learned to respect what i have
[17:10] <Budda> i have a 250gb hdd lying in my wardrobe that i dont use anymore cause its too small
[17:11] <Dommys> This is hilarious
[17:11] <Marach-17> i don't care if it has buttons or not. i want good games
[17:11] <eritz> control factors into a good game
[17:11] <Dommys> >implying someone with a hard drive not from 2000 doesn't respect his hardware
[17:11] <eritz> if it controls like shit because it relies on emulated buttons, the game isn't going to be fun
[17:11] <Shadaez> eritz with multitouch you can easily simulate buttons and an analog stick quite well
[17:11] <Marach-17> umm, by filling it with shit
[17:11] <Dommys> How full is your 36gb?
[17:11] <Marach-17> you don't quite respect free space
[17:11] <SSC> http://everybodyedits.com/?/xd-triforces
[17:12] <Marach-17> i usually have like 5gb free
[17:12] <SSC> :D my new climbing map
[17:12] <eritz> marach, a single season of Star Trek is bigger than your entire hard drive
[17:12] <Dommys> Sounds like it's pretty full of shit
[17:12] <Dommys> Guess you don't respect it.
[17:12] <Marach-17> Dommys: i can make a map
[17:12] <Rithiur> Shadaez: But even with multitouch, you can't have feedback on buttons, which makes the controls worse.
[17:12] <Marach-17> there...
[17:12] <Dommys> On a napkin? with a crayon?
[17:12] <Dommys> to the treasure?
[17:12] <Shadaez> Worse != bad
[17:12] <Marach-17> Rithiur: you just need to get used to it. it's better than it seems
[17:13] <eritz> no tactile feedback is better than it seems?
[17:13] <Budda> id rather a DS over an ipod touch
[17:13] <eritz> membrane keyboards say 'hi'
[17:13] <Shadaez> i hate membrane keyboards
[17:13] <Dommys> I have 2 ds's 2 psp's, and No IpodTouch/Iphone
[17:13] <Marach-17> windows alone: 2.5 gb. i wonder what the hell to they stuff here??
[17:13] <Budda> had a psp, sold it though
[17:13] <Marach-17> do*
[17:13] <eritz> membrane keyboards are bad because of a lack of tactile feedback
[17:14] <Dommys> "what the hell to they stuff here"
[17:14] <Rithiur> Plus, multitouch interfaces aren't exactly designed for ergonomics
[17:14] <Marach-17> 1.2gb pagefile. i need more ram
[17:14] <eritz> it's why buttons and keys are good
[17:14] <Dommys> Marach, just spend a third of your APPLE PRODUCT budget on a hard drive, and you won't have to worry about the size of your OS install.
[17:14] <Dommys> Nub :D
[17:14] <Budda> Marach-17: and when you get into the 21st century with more than 36gb, you come to realise that 2.5gb is nothing worth worrying about because its so small
[17:14] <eritz> any platform without keys or buttons is autofail as a traditional gaming platform, IMO
[17:14] <Marach-17> tell that my crt display :3
[17:14] <Budda> oh god
[17:14] <Dommys> LoL..
[17:15] <Dommys> What do you do, Marach?
[17:15] * Budda flexes his epeen
[17:15] <Dommys> Work wise?
[17:15] <Shadaez> eritz traditional

[17:15] <eritz> okay, great, so, no traditional games are going to work well
[17:15] <Shadaez> eritz you can sell a game for a few bucks and make plenty of money
[17:15] <eritz> so, that leaves what, two, maybe three genres?
[17:15] <Marach-17> steam with games: 12 gb
[17:16] <Shadaez> eritz, have you played any games on one?
[17:16] <Budda> steam with games: 90+gb
[17:16] <Shadaez> do you think the wii sucks, too?
[17:16] <eritz> the wii has buttons
[17:16] <Marach-17> i don't have any games i don't play anymore. steam saves the savegames
[17:16] <eritz> A, B, control stick, they're all there
[17:16] <eritz> and, for the record, i'm not that fond of the wii
[17:16] <Dommys> Same here.
[17:17] <eritz> BECAUSE its unorthodox controls hinder it more than help it
[17:17] <Marach-17> wii has to be awesome :D
[17:17] <Rithiur> But it's true that touch screens can be good for games the rely heavily on pointer control.
[17:17] <Dommys> BECAUSE game developers think that the gimmick of wiggle/waggle will not hamper their games.
[17:17] <Marach-17> i can't wait for it to arrive
[17:17] <Marach-17> probably tomorrow
[17:17] <eritz> yes, that is true, rithiur
[17:17] <eritz> however, the scope of those games is limited at best
[17:17] <Dommys> "flight control"
[17:17] <Dommys> lol
[17:18] <Marach-17> rest of program files: 6 gb
[17:18] <eritz> you can't build an entire ecosystem on a few narrow genres
[17:18] <Marach-17> utorrent downloads: 860 mb
[17:18] <bildramer> wtf
[17:19] <bildramer> I turn sound on
[17:19] <Rithiur> And honestly, tactile buttons are mostly useful only for games that require precision and speed like actions games.
[17:19] <bildramer> MC crashes
[17:19] <Marach-17> lol
[17:19] <eritz> my transfer total on utorrent right now is 175.5 GB
[17:19] <eritz> and i turned it off on saturday
[17:19] <bildramer> owait
[17:19] <Marach-17> rest of documents and settings: 2 gb
[17:19] <bildramer> fixed
[17:19] <Dommys> My P2P folder is 450gb, 40gb free.
[17:19] <bildramer> sound still off
[17:19] <Shadaez> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw0utu-LL-Y looks fine to me.
[17:19] <Dommys> Drive*
[17:20] <Dommys> And when my DVDs come in the mail, I'll burn off backups, and clean up the drive, and start all over again
[17:20] <Marach-17> hm, where do i check total transfer? :D
[17:20] <eritz> that is ridiculous
[17:20] <eritz> that game looks like it controls like Metroid Prime Hunters, except without any actual buttons
[17:20] <Marach-17> hm, 126 gb
[17:21] <eritz> in case you've forgotten, MPH, in an ultimate feat of gimmickry, forced you to aim with the stylus
[17:21] <eritz> this was the most unintuitive DS game i've ever played
[17:21] <Shadaez> MPH controlled amazingly, ffs
[17:21] <Dommys> I love that it took him two presses to start the game
[17:21] <bildramer> porn folder
[17:21] <bildramer> 3.16 GB
[17:21] <bildramer> wtf
[17:21] <eritz> and this game looks like that
[17:21] <Dommys> That makes me giggle.
[17:21] <Marach-17> eritz: lool. what did you want to aim witrh??
[17:22] <Marach-17> buttons???
[17:22] <Shadaez> use your thumb with the thumg stylus
[17:22] <eritz> well, here's an idea, marach
[17:22] <eritz> if a game isn't going to work on a platform
[17:22] <Marach-17> anyway, this game isn't very interesting
[17:22] <eritz> how about not making that game for that platform?
[17:22] <Dommys> ^
[17:22] <Marach-17> eritz: it worked
[17:22] <Shadaez> it worked very nicely
[17:22] <Dommys> Not making it anyway, and stealing money from apple fankids
[17:23] <eritz> the more i watch of that iphone game, the more ridiculous it looks
[17:23] <Marach-17> seriously, try something out before you say anything about it
[17:23] <Marach-17> btw, what game?
[17:23] <eritz> "ohey, swipe your finger twice to turn 90 degrees!"
[17:23] * PyroPyro (PyroPyro@93.87.226.53) Quit (Quit: Roger over and out, PyroPyro)
[17:23] <Rithiur> Oh, god. That video reminds me of the times I played FPS games without mouse. Using page up/down to aim up/down, anyone?
[17:23] <eritz> "SO INTUITIVE!"
[17:23] <Dommys> [09:22] <Marach-17> anyway, this game isn't very interesting
[17:23] <Dommys> "this game"
[17:23] <Shadaez> you're so dumb
[17:23] <Dommys> You know what game we're talking about
[17:23] <Marach-17> that was about metroid prme hunters
[17:23] <Shadaez> it's called sensitivity, yo ucan change it
[17:24] <Shadaez> and it has nothing to do with intuitivity
[17:24] <eritz> yes it does
[17:24] <Shadaez> how?
[17:24] <Marach-17> iphone has some good fps games. and they're very intuitive, only rela mouse beats that
[17:24] <Marach-17> real*
[17:24] <eritz> on any other platform, i can apply a tiny amount of pressure to a real analog stick, and turn as far as i want
[17:25] <Shadaez> PC?
[17:25] <Marach-17> haha, aiming with analog stick
[17:25] <eritz> i'm not a big fan of stick aim
[17:25] <Dommys> "[09:25] <Marach-17> haha, aiming with analog stick" that's what this "virtual stick" is :D
[17:25] <eritz> but i bet, with a stick, i could kick an iphone player's ass
[17:25] <Marach-17> nope. swipe works everywhere
[17:26] <eritz> if you put me and my stick, and him and his iphone, in the same game, head to head, i would win
[17:26] <eritz> so fucking fast
[17:26] <Dommys> Agreed.
[17:26] <bildramer> ....
[17:26] <Marach-17> and you've got a perfect scientific proog
[17:26] <Marach-17> f
[17:26] <bildramer> Innuendo level [******** ]
[17:26] <Azathoth> or we can put you and your stick in him and his iphone
[17:26] <Marach-17> because you THINK so! it has to be true
[17:26] <Dommys> Have fun flicking your thumb 5 times to turn once.
[17:27] <Dommys> :D
[17:27] <eritz> i guarantee you that a stick is superior to that touch screen
[17:27] <Marach-17> ...damn Hammer. stop not working
[17:27] <eritz> i don't think so, i know so
[17:27] <Shadaez> because you can't change the sensitivity to make it turn quicker, huh?
[17:27] <Marach-17> you think
[17:27] <Marach-17> you didn't check
[17:27] <eritz> only for lack of a chance
[17:27] <Dommys> Marach-17, Hammer has encountered an error : no available hard drive space. [OK]
[17:27] <Marach-17> it doesn't use it at all
[17:27] <eritz> i think that skydiving without a parachute would hurt
[17:27] <eritz> although i've never done it, i can be pretty damn sure
[17:28] <Azathoth> it's pretty painful
[17:28] <Azathoth> i've done it
[17:28] <Marach-17> me too, no problems
[17:28] <Dommys> I just love, that marach started this whole shit with "NO ONE NEEDS MORE THAN 36gb"
[17:28] <Marach-17> nope, not 36
[17:28] <Marach-17> i said about 100gb. lrn2read
[17:28] <eritz> i haven't forgotten that, dommys
[17:29] <Azathoth> and that he is running out of hard drive space?
[17:29] <Dommys> Yes.
[17:29] <Marach-17> i'm not. they are
[17:29] <Dommys> You have what? 10% of your drive free
[17:29] <Azathoth> oh, hah
[17:29] <Dommys> That sounds pretty full.
[17:29] <Marach-17> i don't care about percents
[17:30] <Dommys> Because it doesn't suit your argument. :D
[17:30] <Azathoth> alright. i'd love to get in on this anti-apple action, but i have a final exam to go to. have fun guys
[17:30] <Marach-17> now you're doing what media dose
[17:30] <Marach-17> does*
[17:30] <Dommys> Gluck Az
[17:30] <Marach-17> making facts look their way

[17:36] <eritz> define 'successful'
[17:37] <eritz> 'successful', as in 'lots of people buy them'?
[17:37] <Dommys> Quality > Quantity
[17:37] <Marach-17> the problem of apple is that they get overconfident after they release something actually good and follow it with shit

[17:38] <Dommys> But you needed apps and games.
[17:39] <Marach-17> yeah, as it completes my collection of current-gen handhelds
[17:39] <eritz> actually, i think a GPS would be fairly useful, in the iphone's utility as a communications device
[17:39] <Dommys> and the people who bought the expensive touch for gps/compass are what? assholes?
[17:39] <Marach-17> i'd get a pandora too if it wasn't going to be shipped with duke nukem forever
[17:40] <eritz> "where are you?" is one of the most commonly-asked questions
[17:40] <eritz> followed closely by "OH MY GOD, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!"
[17:40] <Marach-17> hm, gps CAN be useful. not for me though
[17:41] <Dommys> But since it's offered, and you don't have it.. does it make the people who did buy it, and do use it assholes?
[17:41] <Dommys> Because that's what it sounds like you're saying.. lol
[17:41] <eritz> don't be silly... of course it does
[17:41] <Marach-17> nope. i'm saying it can be actually needed
[17:41] <Shadaez> so you seem to think apple users are all idiots, and that the controls are unintuitive, yet they purchase the games and play them just fine, so they must be pretty easily controlled, right? Unless you're wrong about something
[17:41] <eritz> i contend that they don't play them 'just fine'
[17:41] <Marach-17> i didn't say they're unintuitive
[17:41] <Marach-17> i said the exact opposite
[17:41] <eritz> the conception that the games are being played 'just fine' is RDF in action
[17:41] <Dommys> I think MOST PEOPLE are idiots.. and will buy whatever commercials/friends tell them to buy
[17:42] <Marach-17> ^
[17:42] <Shadaez> what is RDF

[17:44] <Budda> fucking apple fanboys
[17:44] <Marach-17> so "??" doesn't render correctly for you?
[17:44] <Budda> ipad is such a waste of money
[17:44] <Dommys> That's why he bought the "CHEAP" apple product. lol
[17:45] <Budda> Marach-17, its a line
[17:45] <eritz> hey, that thing i posted is the cheapest diamond-encrusted solid gold iPad there is!
[17:45] <Marach-17> it's a l with a stroke
[17:45] <Budda> zenie
[17:45] <Dommys> I bet it is.
[17:45] <Budda> what game is taht off...
[17:45] <Dommys> You stroke your l too much, I think.

[22:36] <Marach-17> it will be only better from now on
[22:37] <rob`> even if there are no minecraft updates ever again, I got my money's worth. Still, it would be sad to see it die.
[22:37] <Marach-17> did i mention i'm a Notchology student.
[22:37] <slowriot> has he updated yet?

[22:44] <gdude2002> No it doesn't.
[22:44] <Seif> sounds more like theres something wrong with your setup, Marach-17, chrome is universally known as faster
[22:44] <gdude2002> :P

[23:28] <Vicrry> yeps
[23:29] <Yourself> silver is better
[23:29] <bildramer> no silverwar- wait
[23:29] <bildramer> meh
[23:29] <bildramer> spoon cooling
[23:30] <Yourself> helium II would be the best
[23:30] <Yourself> but that has to be less than 2.2 K
[23:30] <Yourself> if it goes above that the thermal conductivity goes to hell
[23:30] <Yourself> diamond is a good conductor of heat
[23:30] <Yourself> about twice as good as silver
[23:31] <Yourself> graphite's also a decent conductor of heat
[23:31] <Yourself> can even be better than diamond
[23:32] <Marach-17> pencil cooling
[23:32] <Yourself> not really
[23:33] <Yourself> there's a clay binder in pencil lead which ruins the properties of graphite
[23:33] <Marach-17> what?
[23:33] <Yourself> pencil lead is not pure graphite
[23:33] <Marach-17> :/
[23:34] <Konogan> My pencil leads are 100% pencil lead.
[23:36] <Vicrry> I wants a 100% lead pencil :P
[23:36] <Yourself> Munroe's method of making pencils was painstakingly slow, and in the neighbouring town of Acton, a pencil mill owner named Ebenezer Wood set out to automate the process at his own pencil mill
[23:36] <Yourself> Ebenezer Wood?
[23:36] <Yourself> Really?
[23:36] <Vicrry> WEEE I CANS GIVES PEOPLE HEAVY METAL POISONING! :P
[23:36] <Yourself> that's almost as ironic as Thomas Crapper

[23:43] <Marach-17> creeper is already penis-shaped
[23:43] <Marach-17> ...
[23:43] <bildramer> lol
[23:44] <Kodaichi> I mean, yeah of course I can freeze the clock value
[23:44] <Kodaichi> but that could mess things up a lot
[23:44] <Kodaichi> plus I wouldn't know how to hack it
[23:44] <Marach-17> q: how long it takes to build a hollow cube of 9888 blocks?
