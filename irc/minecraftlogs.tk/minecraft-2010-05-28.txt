[0:48] <Darkebrz> The only thing I want to be able to do in minecraft is having firable explosive weaponry right now
[0:48] <Darkebrz> Castle sieges would just be way to fun
[0:48] <thechris> lol
[0:49] <thechris> i want to make tnt arrows
[0:49] <thechris> carefully cut the TNT into 8ths and attach them to the arrows
[0:49] <thechris> mabye it could need string to make it expensive
[0:50] <Firetempest> rather then using craft windows, if blocks matched a specific pattern in the world with the right materials it then should turn into a functioning item. like a catapult made from stone and wood.
[0:50] <thechris> so you can just lay it out on the ground?
[0:52] <Firetempest> yeah, you would just build it like a lego pattern and it would turn into a usable item. like the body can be anything, but the weight and launcher arm of a catapult would be the functioning part
[0:52] <thechris> cool
[0:52] <thechris> good for things to big for the crafting window
[0:53] <thechris> ie a catupalt
[0:53] <thechris> or mine carts

[2:02] <Snowman> Calculus (Latin, calculus, a small stone used for counting) is a branch in mathematics focused on limits, functions, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. This subject constitutes a major part of modern mathematics education. It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus, which are related by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Calculus is the study of change, in the same way that geometry is the study of sha
[2:02] <Snowman> pe and algebra is the study of operations and their application to solving equations. A course in calculus is a gateway to other, more advanced courses in mathematics devoted to the study of functions and limits, broadly called mathematical analysis. Calculus has widespread applications in science, economics, and engineering and can solve many problems for which algebra alone is insufficient.
[2:02] <vurtual> what happened with my chair
[2:02] <vurtual> It's shredded.
[2:02] <Snowman> Oops
[2:02] <vurtual> Who shredded my chair
[2:02] <Azathoth> shut the fuck up snowman... it's calculator use
[2:03] <Snowman> Go suck a calculator
[2:03] <Azathoth> maybe i will
[2:03] <vede> calculus is calculator use fuh-sho.
[2:03] <bildramer> lol
[2:03] <vede> Anyone who says otherwise needs to STFU.
[2:03] <Azathoth> ^
[2:03] <blaster> Calcul (ator) us (e)
[2:03] <vurtual> you calculator your limit.
[2:03] <bildramer> calculus is derivatives and shit
[2:03] <bildramer> integrals
[2:03] <Snowman> ALl of you can't even write boobs on your calculators
[2:03] <vurtual> CALCULATOR TPO PERCENTAGE
[2:03] <Snowman> Also, pi contains boobs 2 times in the first 400k digits
[2:03] <Azathoth> mmmmm
[2:03] <bildramer> f(x) = x^2 then wat b f'(x) lel
[2:03] <vurtual> double set :D
[2:03] <Azathoth> pi is so sexy
[2:03] <bildramer> etc.
[2:04] <Snowman> f'(x) = 2x
[2:04] <bildramer> yup
[2:04] <Snowman> Hurr
[2:04] <bildramer> and what's the integral?
[2:04] <bildramer> c + x^3/2
[2:04] <bildramer> methinks
[2:04] <bildramer> no wait
[2:04] <Snowman> Integral of what to what?
[2:04] <bildramer> that's the antider
[2:04] <bildramer> ivative
[2:04] <Snowman> You fail
[2:04] <Azathoth> (1/3)x^3
[2:04] <Snowman> You mean the primitive
[2:04] <bildramer> whatever
[2:04] <bildramer> we don't do calculus
[2:04] <bildramer> lol
[2:04] <Azathoth> because you're 14
[2:04] <Snowman> integral is used to calculate the surface under a function
[2:04] <bildramer> well, yeah
[2:05] <vede> You people suck at calculus.
[2:05] <vede> srsly.
[2:05] <Snowman> I told you
[2:05] <bildramer> I still don't understand what's the difference of this and using the function as the derivative
[2:05] <bildramer> or something
[2:05] <vede> Just put y=x^2 in your calculator.
[2:05] <Snowman> It was the only part of maths I wasn't good at
[2:05] <vede> That's how you do calculus.

[2:08] <Azathoth> and then i fucking hated it
[2:08] <Dommys> I've never enjoyed a web comic.

[2:08] <Snowman> You've never enjoyed life either

[2:12] <bildramer> I have to be at school at like 08:50
[2:12] <Snowman> CTL ALT DEL opens a menu in Vista/Seven
[2:12] <TrueWolves> THAT R VIRUS!
[2:12] <vurtual> try shift while you put a CD in
[2:12] <vurtual> it stops autoplay
[2:12] <Snowman> Ctrl Shift Esc opens Task Manager in Vista/Seven
[2:12] <Azathoth> it hurls tasks at people
[2:12] <bildramer> vurtual, we know
[2:13] <TrueWolves> Snowman, said menu has a tast manager as an option in it
[2:13] <bildramer> *I
[2:13] <Snowman> Yeah
[2:13] <TrueWolves> I don't use XP
[2:13] <Snowman> But it takes an extra click
[2:13] <Azathoth> yeah
[2:13] <Snowman> Use CTRL SHIFT ESC
[2:13] <Azathoth> that menu gets really annoying
[2:13] <Snowman> Less work
[2:13] <Azathoth> i never use any of the other options on the ctrl-alt-del menu
[2:13] <TrueWolves> Hell, in the whole 1 yaer and 7 days I've been in this channel if I've ever brought up an OS I use it's always been about problems I run in with a low RAM Vista computer.

[2:13] <Azathoth> and ctrl-shift-esc is hard to use
[2:14] <Snowman> It's easier than Ctrl Alt Del
[2:14] <vurtual> It uses one hand
[2:14] <Snowman> It takes only one hand
[2:14] <Azathoth> i have to fucking twist my hand all crazy to do it
[2:14] <Azathoth> maybe it's just the layout of my keyboard
[2:14] <vurtual> pinky on ctrl, mysteriousunnamedfinger on shift
[2:14] <vurtual> index on esc
[2:14] <Snowman> Use middle finger for Esc and thumb and index finger for ctrl and shift
[2:14] <vurtual> middle finger on the ` key because why not
[2:14] <TrueWolves> meh
[2:14] <Azathoth> oh, that works better snowman
[2:14] <TrueWolves> Memory defaults to Ctrl-alt-delete I'll proubly switch sooner or later
[2:14] <Snowman> ALways did it that way
[2:15] <Azathoth> i was trying pinky on ctrl, ring finger on shift, and middle on escape
[2:15] <Azathoth> and that literally hurt my hand
[2:15] <Snowman> It's how the pros do it
[2:15] <Snowman> You can take out the thumb/index finger
[2:15] <Snowman> ANd do Shift and Ctrl with one finger
[2:15] <Azathoth> still, it's easier for me to ctrl-alt-del
[2:15] <Azathoth> i default to that from years of practice
[2:15] * vurtual does Azathoth's version
[2:15] <vurtual> doesn't hurt at all
[2:15] <Snowman> What if you're fapping?
[2:16] <Snowman> You'd have to stop it
[2:16] <Azathoth> i use my left hand to fap anyway
[2:16] <TrueWolves> SOMETIMES
[2:16] <vurtual> okay now I challenge you
[2:16] <TrueWolves> youz got to use both hands~
[2:16] <bildramer> uh
[2:16] <bildramer> yes
[2:16] <vurtual> middle on shift
[2:16] <Snowman> You can do Ctrl Shift Esc with right as well
[2:16] <vurtual> pinky on ctrl
[2:16] <vurtual> thumb on esc
[2:16] <bildramer> I can do with 2 hands, 2 hand
[2:16] <vurtual> DO IT
[2:16] <Azathoth> vurtual, maybe it's my keyboard. the top row of keys are kinda strange

But if I make a joke about, say, paraplegics or blind people, and
[2:22] <vede> a paraplegic or blind person says, "HEY MAN THAT's OFFENSIVE," people will most likely tell ME to shut up and stop being a dick. Also, long message is long. Get over it.

[2:36] <Azathoth> that could probably get a bit unhealthy
[2:36] <vurtual> meat flavor poptarts.
[2:36] <vurtual> ...unhealthy?
[2:36] <vurtual> Are you dumb in the butt?
[2:36] <bildramer> antivegan: eat anything except vegan food
[2:36] <Azathoth> yes
[2:36] <vurtual> Bacon and eggs for breakfast
[2:36] <blaster> Bildramer play the campain first
[2:36] <vurtual> a ham sandwich for lunch
[2:36] <bildramer> mmhm
[2:36] <vurtual> some dinner that is meat/has meat
[2:36] <bildramer> sammiches
[2:36] <vurtual> not gonna kill you
[2:36] <Azathoth> oh
[2:36] <Shadaez> don't worry vurtual, poptarts aren't vegetarian
[2:36] <vurtual> It will do the exact opposite, and you will live longer.
[2:36] <Azathoth> i thought you meant you would only eat things if they were meat
[2:36] <Darkebrz> Okay
[2:36] <Azathoth> as in no bread and shit
[2:36] <Darkebrz> How long does it take WoW
[2:37] <Darkebrz> To log into game server
[2:37] <Azathoth> lol WoW
[2:37] <bildramer> ^
[2:37] <vurtual> I remember eating nothing but meat for breakfast on my birthday once.
[2:37] <vurtual> Sausage, a giant hamsteak, some bacon, and then... water.
[2:37] <blaster> I am going to check how my new ship compares to the original ones
[2:37] <bildramer> ...what the fuck is this shit
[2:37] <Azathoth> like you would eat hamburgers, but instead of buns, you'd have more meat
[2:37] <bildramer> Game Maker?

[2:39] <blaster> Hmm this ship is quite overpowered
[2:39] <bildramer> in ship maker, that is
[2:39] <vurtual> ship maker?
[2:39] <vurtual> Sounds like princess maker
[2:39] <blaster> bildramer go to the section proporties
[2:39] <vurtual> but with spaceships
[2:39] <vurtual> and that sounds really cool
[2:40] <blaster> My ship is overpowered
[2:40] <Azathoth> your dick is overpowered
[2:40] <blaster> Either that or I designed it too well
[2:40] <bildramer> nvm there's mirroring
[2:40] <blaster> Azathoth stop with the jokes about my dick
[2:40] <Azathoth> how the hell can you design something too well
[2:41] <blaster> I made it more powerful that anything else
[2:41] <blaster> It can take down 4 ships that are supposed to be half as strong
[2:42] <blaster> NVM there is this smaller ship called sinapse which can anialate it easy
[2:42] <blaster> So its good in some situations but not others
[2:42] <Azathoth> wow
[2:43] <bildramer> woot balance
[2:43] <Shadaez> i love how people are intolerant to vegetarians

[3:01] <Quatroking> don't talk shit about lego
[3:01] <Quatroking> really
[3:01] <vurtual> Valve works as hard as they can, slaving nonstop to get the ideal game out

[3:01] <vurtual> And you just outright hate all their 24/7 work on one bad experience?
[3:02] <Quatroking> they'll*
[3:02] <DIProgan> half-life is a copy, counter-strike is a copy of a copy of a...
[3:02] <Quatroking> half-life is a Stephen King ripoff
[3:02] <Azathoth> counter-strike is a copy of what exactly?
[3:02] <blaster> I played half life for 2 hours
[3:02] <DIProgan> take a Quake mod pick
[3:02] <vurtual> Starcraft was a 40k ripoff.
[3:02] <blaster> So that cancels out half life
[3:02] <vurtual> did you get beyond the initial intro?
[3:03] <blaster> I also played tf2 and found it boring AND frustrating
[3:03] <Azathoth> nothign can ever be truly original
[3:03] <DIProgan> as usual it all comes down to what copy you fancy
[3:03] <blaster> Yes I did vurtual
[3:03] <Azathoth> everything is going to be inspired by other things
[3:03] <vurtual> ...you found TF2 "frustrating"
[3:03] <blaster> Even past the swamp where you go on that hovercraft thing
[3:03] <Rooster> I guess I'm not old enough to understand the deal with the first Half-Life game. It was kind of boring.
[3:03] <vurtual> ...
[3:03] <vurtual> that's half-life 2
[3:03] <Quatroking> vurtual
[3:03] <Azathoth> but saying that things are ripoffs of other things when they obviously are not is going a little far
[3:03] <vurtual> You are lying now.
[3:03] <blaster> I meant half life 2
[3:03] <Quatroking> half-life is a stephen king ripoff
[3:03] <Quatroking> really
[3:03] <Quatroking> it is
[3:03] <DIProgan> nothing can ever be perfect either without having a ruleset, set by someone..
[3:03] <vurtual> okay the canals suck.
[3:03] <vurtual> past the airboat is fun, honestly.

[3:03] <Quatroking> snowman, yes they do

[3:04] <EmpiresBane> that's not very far...
[3:04] <Azathoth> quatroking, what the fuck are you talking about
[3:04] <DIProgan> like what's original, do you need to be inspired by non-human objects, what is unique etc. etc.
[3:04] <Quatroking> in the mist some experiment by the government goes wrong
[3:05] <vurtual> quake was also an experiment gone wrong
[3:05] <vurtual> but quake was ripping off hp lovecraft
[3:05] <Quatroking> and monsters from an other dimension come in
[3:05] <Azathoth> some experiment going wrong is a common plot element
[3:05] <EmpiresBane> wow... even more people have been voiced...
[3:05] <Azathoth> it relaly doesn't look that similar
[3:05] <Snowman> Farmville is also an experiment gone wrong
[3:05] <DIProgan> Quake was ripping of Wolfenstein 3D
[3:05] <DIProgan> but they made that so
[3:05] <Snowman> Portal is an experiment gone wrong
[3:05] <Quatroking> no really some monsters even look like HL monsters
[3:05] <Snowman> Minesweeper is an experiment gone wrong
[3:05] <vurtual> portal isn't an experiment gone wrong in the normal sense. You are the gone wronging.
[3:05] <Quatroking> there's an antlion

[3:06] <vurtual> striders/tripods.
[3:06] <Snowman> vurtual, HURR LOST
[3:06] <Azathoth> that doesn't make it a blatant ripoff

[3:09] <blaster> Vede if you have a station you can hide behind it while it repairs your ships
[3:09] <vede> Why would you want to draw a shield instead of just... having a circular one.
[3:09] <Azathoth> but it's not a universal fix. just helps in most cases
[3:09] <Rooster> It's the opposite for me

[3:33] <EmpiresBane> severe lack?
[3:33] <EmpiresBane> there is none
[3:33] <Azathoth> hahah
[3:33] <Azathoth> there's collision detection with the world
[3:33] <Azathoth> kinda
[3:33] <EmpiresBane> unless you call putting it wherever the ground is a collision

[3:38] <Azathoth> Although the packaging of Big Rigs states that the main objective of the game is to race their Big Rig to safety in order to deliver illegal cargo being carried by the vessel, while avoiding the local police force, in actuality, there are no police in the game, and no such objectives are presented within the game itself.
[3:38] <Azathoth> the funny thing is

[4:25] <EmpiresBane> cars?
[4:25] <ClassiestMedic> Grrr
[4:25] <ClassiestMedic> I gotta have permission
[4:25] <ClassiestMedic> from mom & dad

[4:26] <ClassiestMedic> they said No

[4:26] <EmpiresBane> you asked if your friends can drive you?
[4:27] <ClassiestMedic> yes
[4:27] <EmpiresBane> then keep aasking
[4:27] <EmpiresBane> or fix the keyboard
[4:27] <ClassiestMedic> I spilled Coke in it

[4:49] <AndrewPH> minecraft?
[4:49] <Rils> Uh, yeah
[4:49] <Cial> custom servers sending fake info
[4:49] <AndrewPH> or getting dos'd
[4:49] <Cial> that too
[4:50] <Rils> I dunno, OVER9000 9000/9000 doesn't seem like a dos'd server.
[4:50] <AndrewPH> which is pretty unlikely
[4:50] <AndrewPH> Rils, that could be a fake server
[4:50] <Rils> highly likely :/
[4:50] <AndrewPH> it's very easy to fake a heartbeat
[4:50] <Cial> could be?
[4:50] <Cial> lol
[4:50] <AndrewPH> you can do it in a browser
[4:50] <Rils> Within the last 15 minutes the users online have gone from 400 to 100,000
[4:50] <EmpiresBane> how?
[4:51] <Rils> correction 1mil
[4:51] <EmpiresBane> 1018418 players playing on 367 server
[4:51] <EmpiresBane> that's a much better player/server ratio than before
[4:51] <Rils> If only XD
[4:51] <vurtual> and the TMP sounds similar
[4:51] <Rils> INFINITE 1000000/0
[4:51] <Rils> :|

[4:53] <Cial> or people need to stop sending fake heartbeats

[4:54] <Cial> or expecting this community to accept its "hacking" brethren
[4:54] <Rils> Notch seems to have accepted the "hacking" brethren
[4:54] <Rils> :/
[4:54] <LuciferZ> What is the community going to do to reject its hacking brethren?
[4:54] <Cial> Notch yes the rest of this channel no
[4:54] <Guest163043767> What
[4:55] * Guest163043767 is now known as LG_Legacy
[4:55] <vede> Notch openly dislikes Minecraft hacks.
[4:55] <Rils> Yet his todo list says otherwise.
[4:55] <Varriount> Even server :|
[4:55] <Snowman> It's there for a reason
[4:55] <Rils> Or he's at least accepted it, regardless of dislike.
[4:55] <Snowman> Notch wants to put the hacks in the game to prevent people from using third party applications
[4:55] <Snowman> Which are pretty easy to make malicious
[4:56] <Snowman> He doesn't want hacks at all
[4:56] <Snowman> But it's the best way in his opinion
[4:56] <LG_Legacy> Don't we have a rule against discussing hacks? Oh wait thats discussing how to make/get them.
[4:56] <Snowman> Because of lazy fat kids who can't be fucked to put some effort into something

[4:57] <Rils> There's a difference between Effort, and having to do bullshit busy work.
[4:57] <LuciferZ> Amen
[4:57] <Snowman> Back in my day, we had to do everything by hand
[4:57] <LuciferZ> Back in your day, shit sucked
[4:57] <Snowman> IT BUILDS CHARACTER
[4:57] <LuciferZ> Which is the point of back in my day stories
[4:57] <Snowman> Helps you not being lazy
[4:57] <Cial> i agree Snowman
[4:57] <Rils> We still have to build by hand, it's just getting to the location that has changed.
[4:57] <LuciferZ> To realize that you're a damaged person
[4:57] <Cial> if you are going to use the hacks you should have to go at least a week without them first
[4:57] <vede> Rils, he's planning to add their functionality to the game because he wants to encourage people to use a method he has control of, so that server owners can disable them more effectively.
[4:58] <Snowman> Building with flyhacks and autoclickers? That's not really by hand
[4:58] <Cial> i dont like auto clickers
[4:58] <Rils> I'd rather focus on what I'm creating rather than dwelling on How I'm going to manage to get around to that corner block with the least amount of afterward deletion.
[4:58] <LuciferZ> Nobody uses autoclickers for legitimiate purposes
[4:58] <Bidoof_King> I use it to build
[4:58] <Varriount> What about flying though?
[4:58] <vede> Basically, adding flying and such to the core game is the best way to remove them.
[4:58] <LuciferZ> And autoclickers, also, aren't hacks
[4:59] <Varriount> I never had a use for autoickers
[4:59] <EmpiresBane> speed is useful for the things i do
[4:59] <Snowman> vede, yeah it is, even though it's sad it has to be this way
[4:59] <Varriount> I just use cuboid
[4:59] <LuciferZ> I've used one to dig out caves
[4:59] <vede> Indeed.
[4:59] <LuciferZ> Before I had box
[4:59] <Bidoof_King> Using a fill like that though takes some of the fun out of it
[4:59] <EmpiresBane> working on a scale of 3^6 is just not feasible without scale
[4:59] <Bidoof_King> on some things at least
[4:59] <LuciferZ> Not to me
[4:59] <LuciferZ> I'm building a city right now
[4:59] <vede> Rils, what's your opinion on slopes or curves in Minecraft?
[4:59] <Snowman> IMHO, building is more important than the result in this game though
[5:00] <LuciferZ> A motherfucking city, and I'm going to be finished in a week
[5:00] <Rils> What sort of slopes and curves?
[5:00] <EmpiresBane> oh shit...
[5:00] <EmpiresBane> There are -990584 players playing on 369 servers
[5:00] <vede> Like, sloped blocks.
[5:00] <Snowman> Cause you can just look at the creations you made, maybe walk in them
[5:00] <Snowman> Doesn't offer THAT much fun
[5:00] <Rils> I would like them, but they can break the gameplay.
[5:00] <Snowman> The essence is really the building
[5:00] <Snowman> EmpiresBane, someone fucking with the heartbeat again?
[5:00] <EmpiresBane> ....
[5:00] <LuciferZ> I prefer the product, but that might be because I'm an artist
[5:00] <EmpiresBane> not me.
[5:00] <Snowman> ...
[5:01] <Snowman> I'll tweet Notch
[5:01] <Cial> am i odd to say that i have fun building large airships while flying?
[5:01] <Rils> I disagree, Turning something flat into a square 3d world is rewarding.
[5:01] <vede> ... You're concerned with breaking gameplay, but you think that the game's basic gameplay mechanic is bullshit?
[5:01] <EmpiresBane> i'm done now.
[5:01] <Bidoof_King> Every block being able to break into a half block would be the only thing we need
[5:01] <EmpiresBane> i wan't the first one though
[5:01] <EmpiresBane> AndrewPH tempted me. it's his fault
[5:01] <Varriount> Look at the count now
[5:01] <Varriount> The llaye count is in the negatives
[5:02] <EmpiresBane> i just pointed that out...
[5:02] <Rils> I never said the basic gameplay mechanic is bullshit, I just said it's busywork, it gets in the way.
[5:02] <Snowman> There
[5:02] <Snowman> Tweeted Notch
[5:02] <vede> Anyway, if you like Minecraft but hate the idea of playing it as it's designed to be played, I suggest you give up on Minecraft and go check out Sauerbraten.
[5:02] <Snowman> He's probably sleeping atm
[5:02] <Rils> Falling off your scaffold for the hundredth time is not productive or character building.
[5:02] <Rils> It's just annoying.
[5:02] <Snowman> But he'll read it in the morning
[5:02] <Snowman> Rils, that's why the ENter key was invented
[5:02] <Varriount> I agree with Rils
[5:02] <Varriount> Yes
[5:02] <vede> Rils, if you fall off a scaffold more than once or twice, you don't have enough experience.
[5:03] <Cial> yea but even with that its still a pain in the ass
[5:03] <Rils> :/
[5:03] <vede> I can build massive bridges and not fall once.
[5:03] <Varriount> But what about griefers who do use hacks?
[5:03] <vurtual> what is happening here
[5:03] <Cial> ban them and move on
[5:03] <Rils> Then maybe my projects are just bigger than yours :V
[5:03] <Snowman> Cial, what if they're going so fast you can't see who's griefing?
[5:03] <Bidoof_King> greifers happen, there's nothing we can really do about them other than banning
[5:03] <vurtual> cial, what about the guys who would attack my server?
[5:03] <vurtual> New IPs every time
[5:03] <vurtual> joined in 3s
[5:03] <vurtual> would smash everything
[5:03] <TrueWolves> Honeypot servers
[5:03] <Snowman> There are 1000009411 players playing...
[5:04] <LuciferZ> Vurtual, use a custom server :3
[5:04] <vurtual> would constantly find me, even if private.
[5:04] <Varriount> And if you have a hollow map that people fall thorugh and can't get to ledes?
[5:04] <vede> Rils, or you suck at controlling your avatar without relying on third-party tools to break the movement mechanics.
[5:04] <Snowman> More people playing that registered
[5:04] <Cial> well vurtual they will do the same damn thing with or without hacks
[5:04] <vurtual> andw ould warp around
[5:04] <vurtual> cosntantly smashing things
[5:04] <TrueWolves> Checking the Swedish spelling of "exponential" led to 40 minutes wasted on Wikipedia. Fascinating!
[5:04] <TrueWolves> <3 Notch
[5:04] <Rils> :/
[5:04] <Cial> and snowman if you cant keep track of who is in your server you need to do a better job
[5:05] <Snowman> What if everyone is swooshing around and you can't keep track of who's doing what?
[5:05] <Bidoof_King> Why do you get so upset about hacks?
[5:05] <EmpiresBane> he needs a freeze actions for the ops
[5:05] <Snowman> It's like giving everyone a gun and then trying to find out who shot
[5:05] <Cial> well then -speed
[5:05] <Bidoof_King> -speed is nice
[5:05] <Snowman> -hax is nice
[5:05] <TrueWolves> huh
[5:05] <Bidoof_King> +ophax is nice
[5:05] <Varriount> Yes
[5:06] <vede> +ophax is unnecessary.
[5:06] <Bidoof_King> then you can shut off everyone elses so you can keep track of them
[5:06] <EmpiresBane> that way they can stop people from building or destroying
[5:06] <TrueWolves> Well, unless another op tells me otherwise
[5:06] <vurtual> and your -everythings do absolutely nothing
[5:06] <Cial> snowman i op on many servers that let the members hack and i can keep track of who is doing what with no problem
[5:06] <Varriount> Bu your forgetting about haxs that ignore those
[5:06] <Snowman> Ophacks is the only thing I can understand, though I still disapprove of it
[5:06] <TrueWolves> I'll let this conversation continue as long as it's sane
[5:06] <Varriount> I use flying to moderate, it's true
[5:06] <vurtual> you suuuck
[5:06] * vurtual boos Varriount off the stage
[5:06] <Bidoof_King> I've only encountered a few hacked 3rd party clients, ones that ignored the -tags
[5:06] <vurtual> What's next!?
[5:06] <Snowman> Cial, what about griefers who act like normal people but secretly grief?
[5:06] <vede> If you can't keep track of a server without the ability to fly or noclip, you need to get your act together.
[5:06] <vurtual> Saying the moon REFLECTS the sun!
[5:06] <EmpiresBane> i stalk people when i'm op...
[5:06] <Varriount> Yes
[5:07] <vurtual> Hah1
[5:07] <Bidoof_King> But otherwise, the -speed works
[5:07] <Varriount> But what about my maps
[5:07] <vede> Same with spawn prisons. If you absolutely need them, ur doin it rong.
[5:07] <vurtual> And then you'll say the earth isn't the center of the universe!
[5:07] <vurtual> Or that it's round!
[5:07] <Varriount> That have ledges and other features
[5:07] <Cial> Snowman, thats why you do your damn job and keep an eye on people
[5:07] <TrueWolves> People who secretly grief are not hard to fine.
[5:07] <Rils> Those must be some really tiny maps.
[5:07] <TrueWolves> find*
[5:07] <Varriount> That can't be gotten to without hacks?
[5:07] <vurtual> /tp
[5:07] <vurtual> durp
[5:07] <TrueWolves> durpdurp
[5:07] <Snowman> Cial, what about the fact that I also want to play the game and not watch everybody the whole time?
[5:07] <vurtual> and climbing for ye olde buildinge of thine structure
[5:07] <LuciferZ> Snowman try using a custom server
[5:07] <Cial> thats why you have teams of OPs
[5:08] <vurtual> Then you aren't being a good admin, Snowman.
[5:08] <Rils> That's why you make a private server
[5:08] <Snowman> So you're saying ops can't play the game AT ALL?
[5:08] <EmpiresBane> Snowman, find somebody who doesn't build a lot and is willing to watch people
[5:08] <TrueWolves> Buidling flying structures with no hax is fun
[5:08] <TrueWolves> =/
[5:08] <EmpiresBane> like me.
[5:08] <Varriount> Eh
[5:08] <vede> There is only one situation in all of Minecraft that can't be gotten to without hacks, and it's so insanely unlikely that it may as well be ignored.
[5:08] <Bidoof_King> Hasn't Notch said he's going to add flying to the game?
[5:08] <Varriount> Is to technically a hack?
[5:08] <TrueWolves> no
[5:08] <TrueWolves> Notch has not
[5:08] <Varriount> I mean
[5:08] <EmpiresBane> no one has ever gotten away with greif in a server that i've opped in while i was around
[5:08] <Bidoof_King> What about on the todo list?
[5:08] <vede> TrueWolves, yes he has.
[5:08] <TrueWolves> He has?
[5:08] <Varriount> Isn't to techniaccally a hack
[5:08] <TrueWolves> ._.
[5:08] <Budda> Anyone here with java+opengl exp?
[5:08] <Rils> Notch is only adding hacks so that he can maintain control of it.
[5:09] <Varriount> Tp
[5:09] <vede> Bidoof_King, he's only adding them so that server owners can disable them.
[5:09] <EmpiresBane> 'course... no server has stayed up for more then a week after opping me...
[5:09] <Snowman> Bidoof_King, it's in there because Notch doesn't want people using third party applications
[5:09] <TrueWolves> That's slightly depressing, I pride myself in huge floating creations done with out fight...
[5:09] <LuciferZ> You can pride yourself on them in Survival
[5:09] <Snowman> So in order to control it and protect the hackers, he will implement it himself
[5:09] <EmpiresBane> vede is right
[5:09] <LuciferZ> In creative, you should have no limits.
[5:09] <vede> To reiterate something I said before: Basically, adding flying and such to the core game is the best way to remove them.
[5:09] <PuyoDead> He planned to add it to basically make the hacks obsolete... but that was a while ago.
[5:09] <Cial> Snowman, on the servers i am on we have at least 5 ops and an irc channel we patrol the server on a regular basis build and if we get a bad feeling about someone we bring it up in the irc
[5:09] <vurtual> in creative you are all maggots, in survival you are all dead maggots.
[5:09] <vurtual> That's how the world works.
[5:10] <Snowman> What about servers with smaller communities?
[5:10] <Rils> TrueWolves, have you tried building an object with dimensions with more than 600x200x400?
[5:10] <Snowman> They have to suffer?
[5:10] <vurtual> they get decent ops, durr
[5:10] <Varriount> vurtual: Your being a bit... Harsh
[5:10] <TrueWolves> Rils, I would and infact have started such a project
[5:10] <EmpiresBane> Snowman, small communities are even easier!
[5:10] <vurtual> Like, me before I hated everyone.
[5:10] <vurtual> My being a bit harsh?
[5:10] <TrueWolves> But my computer wouldn't handle it after a certain point ._.
[5:10] <vurtual> Is my being a bit harsh too harsh for your maggots?
[5:10] <Varriount> Now that's offensive
[5:10] <Siiseli> well, let's try getting some sleep
[5:10] <Snowman> Good plan
[5:10] <Snowman> I'm off
[5:10] <Rils> Whatever happened to being civil :(

[5:13] <TrueWolves> Did the player counter /really/ just overflow?
[5:13] <vurtual> Wait, we were just in #minecraft!
[5:13] <EmpiresBane> no
[5:13] <vurtual> We must have invented a slow teleport.
[5:14] <TrueWolves> Who is using a fake server to mess with the player count?
[5:14] <EmpiresBane> there's a lot of heartbeats with negative players
[5:14] <TrueWolves> ... No I don't expect that to be answered.
[5:14] <SpaceManiac> indeed
[5:14] <LuciferZ> TrueWolves, custom server stuff can send fake player heartbeats
[5:14] <EmpiresBane> you don't need a server
[5:14] <SpaceManiac> yeah, just a heartbeat script
[5:14] <EmpiresBane> no
[5:14] <LuciferZ> True

[5:17] <TrueWolves> How the fuck do you get negative heartbeats?
[5:17] <EmpiresBane> its 3:17am for him
[5:17] <TrueWolves> Now that I think of it.
[5:17] <vurtual> It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.
[5:17] <EmpiresBane> put a negatice in the player count
[5:17] <TrueWolves> huh
[5:17] <TrueWolves> sad it's that easy
[5:18] <SpaceManiac> Maybe Notch will notice someday
[5:18] <TrueWolves> haha
[5:18] <vurtual> can't set the playercount to "eggs"
[5:18] <TrueWolves> He'll proubly notice in 2~3 honestly, if not sooner.

[5:23] <TrueWolves> so it wouldn't show what channels he's in anyway
[5:23] <vurtual> we'd see him in no channels, TrueWolves
[5:23] <TrueWolves> what with all the pedo channels secret and private
[5:23] <Parthon> I figured it's because he's not online any more ;)

[5:39] <EmpiresBane> i was right!

[5:40] <eZek0> What am I waiting for?
[5:40] <vede> I really like how they circumvented the problem of having a mode of transportation that meshes easily with the rest of the game.
[5:40] <Rooster> He ignores some very good arguments and still says his idea is great
[5:40] <Rooster> Vede are you agaisnt whales to?
[5:40] <vede> Just transporting players into a small, whale-specific maplet.
[5:40] <vede> Rooster, I just read the thread for the first time, but it seems like an interesting idea.
[5:40] <SpaceManiac> "I don't like this idea."
[5:40] <SpaceManiac> I don't like you.
[5:40] <SpaceManiac> from the FAQ
[5:41] <vurtual> hurr
[5:41] <SpaceManiac> :P
[5:41] <eZek0> Obviously Whales are awesome, and you just can't understand it.
[5:41] <vurtual> whales suck
[5:41] <vurtual> dolphins on the other hand
[5:41] <vurtual> dolphins make great transport
[5:41] <vurtual> just don't stick aroudn after they bring you to shore

[5:42] <Azathoth> hahahahahahaa
[5:42] <Azathoth> OMG UR SO FUNNY
[5:42] <eZek0> badumtish
[5:42] <vede> Although I'm more fond of the idea of having a game object that transports players to a separate miniature map-thing to simulate 'transportation' across large distances.
[5:42] <EmpiresBane> Azathoth, don't make fun of me....
[5:42] <Azathoth> like... inside of a whale vede?

[5:43] <Azathoth> OMG
[5:43] <vede> The first thing that comes to mind is a submarine, but a *whale* is a really silly (read: fun) idea.
[5:43] <eZek0> yes, fun.
[5:43] <EmpiresBane> sub?
[5:43] <EmpiresBane> made of wood?
[5:43] <eZek0> made of gold
[5:43] <vurtual> also note
[5:43] <eZek0> we need SOME use for gold.
[5:43] * Azathoth builds a big boat and puts 2 creepers, 2 spiders, 2 skeletons, 2 zombies, 2 sheep, and 2 pigs on it
[5:44] <Rooster> God that guy is such a faggit
[5:44] <vurtual> some people have a horrible, nightmarish fear of whales
[5:44] <EmpiresBane> ...
[5:44] <vurtual> and being eaten by them
[5:44] <vurtual> like, seriously
[5:44] <eZek0> Do creepers even breed?
[5:44] <vurtual> I couldn't transport if it was a feature
[5:44] * Rooster must suppress, urge to troll
[5:44] <vurtual> Also some people are turned on by it
[5:44] <EmpiresBane> Rooster, who?
[5:44] <vurtual> so we'd get those type
[5:44] <Rooster> thecraww
[5:44] <vede> What I'm imagining is someone builds a submarine, it becomes a really big (or small? lulz) object, and when you activate the hatch, you enter a finite, long cylindrical map, that you have to manually build all the submarine's decks inside.
[5:44] <Rooster> I just don't like him
[5:44] <eZek0> Rooster, the whole thread is sarcastic to begin with if you didn't ge that
[5:44] <EmpiresBane> is that topic still going?
[5:44] <Azathoth> vede, that's kind of a cool idea
[5:44] <vede> So it'd be a fully functional submarine when it starts out, but it'd just be a big tube, with no separated floors or rooms or anything.
[5:45] <Rooster> eZek0, I bet your thecraww aren't you?
[5:45] <Azathoth> how would you control where it goes though?

[5:45] <vurtual> navigation map
[5:45] <thecraww> Except not really.
[5:45] <vede> So from the outside, you have a submarine that's moving around, but from the inside, you have a finite tube-shaped map.
[5:45] * thecraww is now known as eZek0
[5:45] <vurtual> showing all the visited places

[5:46] * EmpiresBane (EmpiresBan@pool-71-111-54-232.ptldor.dsl-w.verizon.net) has left #minecraft
[5:46] <vede> Azathoth, perhaps there'd be a second hatch on the outside that brings you to a small (non-editable) steering area, or a built-in (non-removable) door at one end of the inside map that leads to that area. Or both.

[6:04] <vurtual> He is very lawful, and good.

[6:09] <eZek0> I don't mind :P Just don't usually see people shortening my name as it's somewhat short already.
[6:09] <TrueWolves> Ahh, sorry.
[6:09] <TrueWolves> heheh
[6:10] <eZek0> And plus with IRC autocomplete makes it easymode.
[6:10] <TrueWolves> Also, one person writting something in to a book doesn't make that word god.
[6:10] <TrueWolves> case and point, Twilight
[6:10] <LuciferZ> BAM
[6:10] <eZek0> Writing is with one T, btw.
[6:10] <LuciferZ> YOU JUST GOT FUCKING LOGICKED BY @
[6:10] * LuciferZ pelvic thrust into not @'s ear
[6:10] <TrueWolves> I'll remember that, sorr-
[6:10] <TrueWolves> Don't do that. =/
[6:11] <eZek0> @ is a cool guy, and doesn't afraid of anything.
[6:11] <TrueWolves> XD
[6:11] <TrueWolves> I love this channel.
[6:11] <EmpiresBane> i almost went into cinvulsions when i stood up and streched
[6:11] <vurtual> dragon is a pretty cool guy, eh uses mildly jumbled english lanaguage and doesn't afraid of anything.
[6:11] <TrueWolves> I can't beleave I've been here scense it's start...
[6:11] <LuciferZ> i love you
[6:12] <eZek0> Where are you from, mr wolfy?
[6:12] <EmpiresBane> i didn't come here til the forums degraded
[6:12] <EmpiresBane> hell, i barely even play minecraft.
[6:12] <TrueWolves> What do you mean where I'm from...? elaberate?
[6:12] <eZek0> Nationality. Wondering what your mothertongue is.
[6:12] <TrueWolves> English, I just have... problems with it, I do try my best to improve it at least.
[6:13] <eZek0> Mmkay x)
[6:13] <TrueWolves> five to six years ago? my spelling was unreadable.
[6:13] <TrueWolves> Here it is today with just passive errors from time to time.
[6:13] <eZek0> I'm somewhat of a grammar nazi, hurr
[6:13] <TrueWolves> I don't mind, again, as long as you don't overload me with fixes I'll do my best to remember them.
[6:14] <eZek0> Just tell me if I get annoying :P
[6:14] <TrueWolves> I'll do so with the B& HAMMAH, no worries, =D
[6:14] <LuciferZ> GUYS
[6:14] <LuciferZ> If you were blessed with being me
[6:14] <TrueWolves> That's a poor joke...
[6:14] <eZek0> But we aren't.
[6:14] <LuciferZ> How would you name a city after yourself?
[6:14] <eZek0> Well, I'd name it after myself.
[6:14] <eZek0> Duh.
[6:14] <vurtual> by becoming notorious in it
[6:14] <vurtual> by constantly being on the news
[6:14] <vurtual> constantly
[6:15] <LuciferZ> Wait let me rephrase that
[6:15] <TrueWolves> ... Your asking what name we could use with your name?
[6:15] <eZek0> you're complicating it too much, vurtual
[6:15] <TrueWolves> for a city though.
[6:15] <eZek0> just use your name
[6:15] <LuciferZ> If you founded a city and wanted to dedicate it to yourself
[6:15] <TrueWolves> Lucifaria
[6:15] <eZek0> Rastafarian.
[6:15] <LuciferZ> No, my name is not a city name, Eze.
[6:15] <eZek0> Yes it is, just add -town to the end.
[6:15] <TrueWolves> If it was me, I'd just name it after my self.
[6:15] <eZek0> LuciferZtown.
[6:15] <TrueWolves> Drake
[6:15] <TrueWolves> The City of Drake
[6:15] <LuciferZ> That is a town name but it's a dumb town name
[6:15] <TrueWolves> Simple, to the point.
[6:15] <eZek0> You're a dumb town name.
[6:15] <LuciferZ> Not yours, True, sorry
[6:15] <LuciferZ> Drake is fine.
[6:16] <TrueWolves> I already got one for yours
[6:16] <TrueWolves> <@TrueWolves> Lucifaria
[6:16] <TrueWolves> ... That is more of a country... hmm...
[6:16] <LuciferZ> Yeah, I'm thinking about it. To be honest, I want something a bit more subtle.
[6:16] <vurtual> I would name the city butts because no matter who I am, Samuel L Jackson takes naming precedence.
[6:16] <eZek0> Quebec is the name of a province and city.
[6:16] <eZek0> SO it doesn't matter.
[6:16] <TrueWolves> Luciferzity
[6:16] <TrueWolves> It sounds like city
[6:16] <TrueWolves> but it's zity
[6:16] <LuciferZ> lololol
[6:16] <eZek0> LucyTown.
[6:16] <Budda> LuciferZ make me an image
[6:16] <Budda> pls
[6:16] <vurtual> Name the town Luke.

[6:19] <EmpiresBane> eZek0, of course not
[6:19] <LuciferZ> I figured. I could try, I don't do a lot of landscapes though.
[6:20] <eZek0> EmpiresBane: of course not what?
[6:20] <Budda> only restrictions LuciferZ, some sort of fantasy rpg setting, doesnt have to be a landscape, and it must have an area for the update news part, doesnt matter where it is, but has to be large enough to read shit from it

[6:21] <Kodaichi> I saw OpenGL and that sparked my interest.

[6:52] <Jat> tune
[6:52] <vurtual> DOOO DEEE DOO DOOO DOOOOOOO, DOOOOOO.
[6:52] <Jat> the one that plays when you restore from a save in metroid 2
[6:52] <Jat> yeah that onevurtual
[6:52] <vurtual> it occours whenever you load in any of the games with saving
[6:53] <vurtual> or when samus awesomely first appears.
[6:53] <Jat> yeah
[6:53] <Jat> in fact that should be the default windows startup sound
[6:53] <vurtual> but what would be the shutdown sound?
[6:53] <Drakkar> metroid prime death
[6:53] <Jat> the sound that occurs when you die in megaman
[6:54] <vurtual> doopdoopdoopdopdopdooop, doooooop?
[6:54] <Drakkar> ye
[6:54] <Jat> or when you die in zelda

[6:54] <vurtual> that's not prime
[6:54] <vurtual> please don't use the prime 2 deathscreen
[6:54] <vurtual> so much nightmares ;_;

[6:55] <vurtual> I FELL IN WATER OKAY

[6:59] <vurtual> if you don't already SEE THEM when looking around and decide to just grab them
[6:59] * manbearpig is now known as MBP
[6:59] <vurtual> They show up to the dark visor in the light world and dark world both, and are always plainly visible in the light world.
[7:00] <vurtual> and they also tell you what room they are in twice over. Missed keybearer lore? Welp, the end area has directions for that.
[7:00] <PuyoDead> Don't get me wrong, I loved the game. But it was a wreteched mechanic to add play time to the game.
[7:00] <vurtual> it gave you a reason to grab the rest of the upgrades you missed
[7:00] <PuyoDead> No, it didn't.
[7:01] <vurtual> you're saying you'd scour the map for energy tanks and missile expansions otherwise?
[7:01] <PuyoDead> The upgrades are a reason for that. That's why they're upgrades.
[7:01] <PuyoDead> Yes. It's Metroid.
[7:01] <Jat> if you got that far with what you have do you really need more?
[7:01] <vurtual> the last bosses aren't any easier, jat.
[7:01] <Jat> any easier than what?
[7:01] <vurtual> than before
[7:01] <TrueWolves> <SenioR> whahahah fravec! I fucked your mother!!
[7:01] <TrueWolves> <@Fravec> Dad, buzz off, I'm talking to friends here...Comment: never teach your dad how to use IRC
[7:01] <vurtual> You'll be so glad you have that extra energy tank.
[7:02] <Jat> oh ok

[7:02] <vurtual> "Egh, more aerotroopers or whatever." *BSCCCHHHH-BZCKHEEEEEEWM*
[7:02] <Vis{AFK}> so epic I shat myself while playing.

[7:04] <Jat> was metroid prime 3 good?

[7:04] <Drakkar> 3 was fine
[7:04] <Drakkar> 3 isn't gamecube
[7:04] <Jat> oh
[7:04] <Jat> well then get 1 and 2 for gamecube?
[7:04] <Drakkar> it uses the wiimote for aiming etc
[7:04] <Drakkar> yeah
[7:04] <Drakkar> def
[7:04] <Jat> oh ok
[7:05] <Jat> ill see if im not too lazy and if i can find them
[7:05] <vurtual> you may or may not want to check up on what tricks work in what versions
[7:05] <Jat> tricks?
[7:05] <vurtual> having player's choice is nice, but finding out you can't do the trick for an early space jump easily is rage-inducing
[7:05] <Jat> i dont really care about tricks
[7:05] <Drakkar> its not that bad vurtual
[7:06] <Drakkar> space jump does make the game better though
[7:06] <vurtual> the alternative is "lock onto spikey thing, slowly walk backwards, attempt jump, fail"
[7:06] <vurtual> no seriously I want a longer version of the quadraxis battle :(
[7:07] <vurtual> You can never have too much combat against a gigantic war machine with an a matter/antimatter cannon.

[9:13] <TrueWolves> mibbit is harder on your computer then mIRC
[9:13] <TrueWolves> so I don't beleave that.
[9:13] <shapeshiftr> My computer starts to get really hot, sound like a dying cat, and freezes.
[9:13] <shapeshiftr> nah.

[9:18] <TrueWolves> that's always fun
[9:18] <Lord_Aidan> I played a level 1 wizard once.

[9:19] <vurtual> what did I imss
[9:19] <Lord_Aidan> Me and my party died fighting some elves
[9:19] <Dommys> I want a tegra 2 netbook
[9:19] <vurtual> what did I miiiiisss
[9:19] <TrueWolves> It is imposable to play a Wizard with 3 CON in some D&D based games, as this limits you to 1hp, and some games have cutscene damage
[9:19] <Lord_Aidan> Everything.
[9:19] <Lord_Aidan> I had 3 hitpoints
[9:19] <Lord_Aidan> 15 Con

[9:20] <Lord_Aidan> I don't recall >.<
[9:20] <Lord_Aidan> Anyhow, I killed a Ettin in one blow
[9:20] <Dommys> What game are you playing?
[9:20] <Azathoth> are we talking about D&D!?
[9:20] <Lord_Aidan> A necrophelis in one blow
[9:20] <vurtual> I FOUND A WAND OF WISHING ON DLEVEL 2 ONCE
[9:20] <vurtual> IT HAD 3 CHARGES
[9:20] <Lord_Aidan> And then got shot in the back by a elven raider
[9:20] <TrueWolves> Glass Cannon?
[9:20] <Dommys> Let's play some D&D
[9:20] <Lord_Aidan> Wand of wishing: Level me up 5 levels
[9:20] <TrueWolves> Everytime I try to run D&D everyone gets bored in character creation and leaves.
[9:21] <Lord_Aidan> Wand of Wishing: Give me +3 sword
[9:21] <vurtual> accidentally got a book
[9:21] <Lord_Aidan> Wow, thats sad.
[9:21] <vurtual> then silver dragon scale mail
[9:21] <vurtual> and an amulet of lifesaving

[9:22] <Dommys> Like, I know there used to be forum software for V:TM
[9:22] <vurtual> so people end up with a load of random abilities that are cool.
[9:22] <vurtual> then someone comes up with a bizarre and mostly useless idea because he has run out of ideas, and it ends up being useful for no apparent reason.

[9:42] <vurtual> yeah I'm really beginning to question why I made his legs mysteriously fly up into the air when he dies.

[9:48] <vurtual> make a diode bridge, do it
[9:48] <Azathoth> it's pretty advanced
[9:48] <Azathoth> i should replace its wheels with LEGS
[9:48] <vurtual> hehe, the fall over animation is pretty cool for when you dash-attack, looks like you swept them off their feet when they tried to shoot you
[9:48] <Azathoth> and make a quadropedal robot

[9:54] <vurtual> :(
[9:55] <Azathoth> or on a more serious note
[9:55] <eZek0> portable ICBMs aren't impractical
[9:55] <Adura> I have one in my pants.
[9:55] <Azathoth> some kind of scatter gun with projectiles that break apart at certain intervals
[9:55] <TrueWolves> make a secret weapon a nuke
[9:55] <TrueWolves> just using it kills everyone, you too
[9:55] <Azathoth> like a shotgun only at say 10 meters, the number of pellets doubles!
[9:55] <Azathoth> but each one is half as powerful
[9:55] <Azathoth> so at super long ranges, you'll hit like everything
[9:55] <Azathoth> but you won't do much damage
[9:56] <Azathoth> oh, and you need an orbital laser weapon
[9:56] <vurtual> the shotgun will fire a cloud of scientific particles.
[9:56] <Azathoth> where you paint a target with a handheld targeting laser, and then some orbital weapon rains down rape on that position
[9:56] <vurtual> that pass through walls.

[10:08] <vurtual> cat is actually a catgirl
[10:08] <vurtual> and cannot deny it
[10:08] <eZek0> Oh shit, there's someone actually named a cat
[10:08] <TKoopa> u... unatco?
[10:08] <eZek0> Didn't see that coming.
[10:08] <vurtual> no, savage
[10:08] <Azathoth> savage
[10:08] <Cat> lol
[10:08] <eZek0> HAI CAT!

[10:09] <Azathoth> savage
[10:09] <Cat> :3
[10:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol hon liq3
[10:09] <vede> Heh. Still remember the code for the first door you find in Deus Ex.
[10:09] <liq3> It's so bad. :(
[10:09] <TKoopa> might as well start using coke
[10:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> i still find it amazing people call it an rts liq3
[10:09] <TKoopa> OH SHIT
[10:09] <TKoopa> OH WHAT WAS THE CODE
[10:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> just because it derived from an rts engine as a mod
[10:09] <liq3> It's a battle arena something.
[10:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> so dumb...
[10:09] <TKoopa> the radar chack
[10:09] <vede> So easy to remember, because it's a common number between System Shock, Deus Ex, books, etc.
[10:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> yeah
[10:09] <Azathoth> THAT'S TERROR
[10:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> eg stupid
[10:09] <liq3> Team Battle Arena.
[10:09] <vede> It's 0451
[10:09] <Azathoth> oh god, fuck you vede
[10:09] <TKoopa> yeah, 0451, that's in bioshock too
[10:09] <liq3> It's funny, I played like 1000+ games of it.
[10:09] <liq3> Then SC2 came out.
[10:09] <vede> In SS, it was a nod to Fahrenheit 451
[10:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[10:10] <liq3> well I got beta.
[10:10] <Azathoth> i just remembered i recently got ahold of system shock 2 :|
[10:10] <vurtual> hm, guys, how am I going to simulate the plasma beam shotgun?
[10:10] <vede> In Deus Ex, it was a nod to SS.
[10:10] <liq3> I've played one game since getting beta.
[10:10] <liq3> ;P
[10:10] <Azathoth> another game i want to play really badly
[10:10] <vede> In Bioshock, it was also a nod to SS.
[10:10] <Azathoth> because i never got around to beating it
[10:10] <TKoopa> it's got a burnt book by it in bioshock
[10:10] <liq3> Anyone who likes RTS games should check out Complete Annihilation.
[10:10] <Azathoth> total annihilation?
[10:10] <liq3> Complete* :p
[10:10] <vurtual> Like, most pass-through-enemies weapons are already ridiculously powerful, and I can't do half-health
[10:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> anyone who likes RTS games should check out any game by chris taylor
[10:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> except supcom 2
[10:10] <vurtual> you mean total annihilation, liq3
[10:10] <TKoopa> Has anybody here played SupCom2?
[10:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> no vurtual
[10:10] <liq3> No. Complete.
[10:10] <vurtual> because "Complete Annihilation" does not exist.
[10:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> complete annihilation
[10:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> yes it does.
[10:10] <vurtual> if you're talking about the horrible spring mod
[10:11] <liq3> vurtual: it actually does.
[10:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> it isn't horrible
[10:11] <vurtual> then get out of here stalker.
[10:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's great
[10:11] <TKoopa> supcom2 suck or something?
[10:11] <liq3> It's better then damn SC2.
[10:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> yeah TKoopa
[10:11] <Azathoth> also, i hated bioshock
[10:11] <bildramer> fuck printers
[10:11] <bildramer> I want to print something black only
[10:11] <Azathoth> fuck ya'll. i said it
[10:11] <liq3> Azathoth: i never finishedi t.
[10:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> they fucked the economy system over completely and dumbed it down TKoopa
[10:11] <Azathoth> i fucking hate bioshock
[10:11] <liq3> It feels terrible.
[10:11] <eZek0> also, back on BC2 for a sec, liq3, if you're attacker on Rush, there's been times where I've singlehandedly won the game for them.
[10:11] <TKoopa> bioshock was too linear for it's lineage
[10:11] <bildramer> and because the other ink cartridges are empty it won't
[10:11] <bildramer> wtf is wrong with it
[10:11] <vurtual> hurrrrr
[10:11] <Azathoth> spiritual successor to system shock, my ass
[10:11] <liq3> eZek0: hah. How'd you do that?
[10:11] <TKoopa> lawl linear for lineage
[10:11] <bildramer> why do people do this? are they really retarded?
[10:11] <vurtual> chk-chk, hurrrrrr, chk-chk, hurrrrrrr, chk-chk
[10:12] <bildramer> lol
[10:12] <vurtual> hurrDURPDHURPDHURHRUHGNJLGJGKJFKGJFKJ OUT OF COLOR INK CANNOT PRINT BLACK
[10:12] <Azathoth> moar liek: let's take out everything good about system shock 1 and 2
[10:12] <vede> I didn't play Bioshock, because it became available to me after I became the hardcore open-source indie-devs awesome guy that I am now.
[10:12] <liq3> eZek0: oh also the damage + aim mechanics tick me off.
[10:12] <Azathoth> and replace it with total shit
[10:12] <vurtual> shredding 99% complete document
[10:12] <eZek0> I'm a good player, I guess. http://bfbcs.com/stats_pc/eZek0/ <-- look at win/loss stats for attacker and defender
[10:12] * vurtual steals your document
[10:12] <TKoopa> I want to see what Warren Spector has done to mickey mouse
[10:12] <liq3> eZek0: Takes 20 fucking bullets to kill a guy, but one fucking tank shell. Be fucking consistent they sohuld.
[10:12] <vede> So I was like, "Oh fuck that commercial close source shit."
[10:12] <vede> *closed
[10:12] <eZek0> Also, liq3, play on Hardcore mode. Much better :)
[10:12] <vurtual> fun fact, both Alyx Vance and The Spitter have a pink thong.
[10:12] <liq3> Oh ye I can't stand the cam BS either.
[10:12] <Azathoth> tkoopa, yeah XD
[10:12] <liq3> Makes sniping fucking impossible.
[10:13] <eZek0> Hardcore also doesn't have killcam.
[10:13] <eZek0> Methinks you'd like it more.
[10:13] <Azathoth> i wonder what would happen if you just showed up at their studio and asked to meet warren spector
[10:13] <TKoopa> Ew MW2?
[10:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> anyways liq3 apparently chris taylor is working on a medieval fantasy rts now!
[10:13] <liq3> eZek0: what am i looking at?
[10:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> rumor has it that he's going back to the TA-roots with it
[10:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> :D
[10:13] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: fuck. I want a goddamn complex as shit RTT.
[10:13] <vurtual> valve has something for pink thongs apparently
[10:13] <vede> I love killcam, and think it should be implemented in more games than it is right now.
[10:13] <Azathoth> oh god. a medieval rts? i hope it's not like TA: kingdoms
[10:13] <vurtual> OH NOT KINGDOMS NOOOOO
[10:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> realtime tactics?
[10:13] <liq3> yes.
[10:13] <eZek0> liq3: right side of the page, a little bit down. "team stats"
[10:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> gah
[10:13] <TKoopa> Azathoth He might be outside measuring the distance between buildings, seeing if he can make out illuminate symbols
[10:13] * vurtual dives out of the internet
[10:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> i h8 rtt
[10:14] <liq3> WH40K tabletop style.
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> i want strategy
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> not tactics
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> well
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> i want a good combo
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> eg TA
[10:14] <liq3> i'm talking like
[10:14] <liq3> having a point system.
[10:14] <TrueWolves> what's the short cut for task manager?
[10:14] <liq3> and having shit like 200 unit armies.
[10:14] <vurtual> ctrl+alt+del
[10:14] <liq3> or more.
[10:14] <vurtual> or ctrl+shift+esc
[10:14] <liq3> like
[10:14] <TrueWolves> the one that's NOT Ctrl+alt+del
[10:14] <liq3> total War.
[10:14] <vurtual> 10k unit armies
[10:14] <liq3> but actually good.
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> liq3 oh
[10:14] <vurtual> ctrl+shift+esc
[10:14] <eZek0> ctrl+shift+esc is for task manager
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> well, chris started a video blog about project liq3
[10:14] <eZek0> *nods*
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> and it's pretty damn funny
[10:14] <liq3> avoiding the "my units move slower then a fucking snail" syndrome and shit.
[10:14] <vede> TrueWolves, right-click taskbar, click "Task Manager"
[10:14] <vede> Fuck keyboard shortcuts.
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> he mentioned actual formations now
[10:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> eg
[10:14] <liq3> hrm
[10:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> not just square boxes
[10:15] <Azathoth> i'd like to see more tactics-oriented RTSes
[10:15] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: you played 40k tabletop?
[10:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> nah, too expensive
[10:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[10:15] <liq3> I have... a bit.
[10:15] <liq3> It's pretty sick.
[10:15] <Azathoth> it seems like most of them are more about fucking build orders and shit
[10:15] <liq3> Price + fucking painting the models stops me from getting into it.
[10:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> pretty much every single new rts focuses on tactics Azathoth
[10:15] <Azathoth> i want to play a game that focuses on actual combat rather than how fast you can rush your opponent
[10:15] <TKoopa> click as fast as you can, and hotkey everything
[10:15] <Azathoth> not really, speljohan
[10:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> yes really
[10:15] <TKoopa> yeah that's how real strategists work
[10:15] <liq3> TKoopa: that's just like aiming in an FPS. :P
[10:15] <TKoopa> they have like, a million hotkeys
[10:15] <liq3> If you guys want a real strategy game, play Go.
[10:16] <Azathoth> oh, i play 40k
[10:16] <TKoopa> liq3 true
[10:16] <liq3> Hardest fucking strategy game on the fucking planet.
[10:16] <Cat> CENSURED
[10:16] <Azathoth> i have 3 40k armies
[10:16] <Cat> damn.
[10:16] <TKoopa> I want a strategy game where you fel more like a commander and less like a computer
[10:16] <liq3> Azathoth: fun isn't it?
[10:16] <Azathoth> and it really is expensive as hell
[10:16] <liq3> It is.
[10:16] <Shadaez> cat is a furry
[10:16] <Speljohan_Laptop> i want a strategy game that doesn't suck
[10:16] <liq3> We need a clone of that on the PC
[10:16] <Speljohan_Laptop> and that's rare
[10:16] <Malikat> what is cat
[10:16] <Cat> No, im not
[10:16] <TKoopa> ahaha
[10:16] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: CA :D
[10:16] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: The more I play it the more I'm liking it. :]
[10:16] <Speljohan_Laptop> the last good rts made was supcom
[10:16] <Speljohan_Laptop> supcom1 that is
[10:16] <Cat> <Shadaez> cat is a furry < nop
[10:17] <Azathoth> yep
[10:17] <Cat> im a cat u see
[10:17] <vurtual> no cat is a catgirl
[10:17] <vurtual> that is not a furry
[10:17] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: also if you want a hard as shit strategy game, play Go.
[10:17] <Malikat> what is cat
[10:17] <Speljohan_Laptop> cbf liq3
[10:17] <Cat> i just love cats.
[10:17] <vurtual> furries are people in costumes and art movement and such
[10:17] <Azathoth> Go to hell
[10:17] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: ;p
[10:17] <TKoopa> The problem is, a lot of these big RTS games are so fun to sit back and watch battles unfold. However, you never a chance to if you don't want your ass handed to you
[10:17] <vurtual> cat is a literal fusion of girl, with a tiny bit of cat, obviously.
[10:17] * MeganC (meganconno@166.133.21.57) has joined #minecraft
[10:17] <liq3> Seriously tho, could you imagine if 40k was a RTT?
[10:17] <liq3> Would fucking own so hard.
[10:17] <Shadaez> i have a kitten running around my desk
[10:17] <Cat> <vurtual> cat is a literal fusion of girl, with a tiny bit of cat, obviously. < true lol
[10:17] <Speljohan_Laptop> TKoopa nearly all fucking new rts's are complete bullshit tho
[10:17] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's like
[10:17] <Speljohan_Laptop> "HERE HAVE 9 UNITS AND FIGHT"
[10:17] <Azathoth> yeah, only not gay like DoW2
[10:17] * Malikat takes cat's tail
[10:17] <Speljohan_Laptop> yeah
[10:17] <Malikat> cat is manx
[10:17] <liq3> Azathoth: yeh. DoW2 fucked up so bad.
[10:17] <Speljohan_Laptop> DoW2 was fucking retarded
[10:18] <Speljohan_Laptop> it was so fucking shallow
[10:18] <Azathoth> DoW2 was unnecessarily scaled down
[10:18] <Speljohan_Laptop> i could write a better rts
[10:18] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[10:18] <Cat> hey Malikat! give it back!
[10:18] <TKoopa> You know what had a bitching good rts element
[10:18] <TKoopa> fucking
[10:18] <liq3> Fuck. I was could be lead desginer for an RTS. :(
[10:18] <TKoopa> Spore, man
[10:18] <TKoopa> that shit was DEEP
[10:18] <liq3> I'd make one so fucking good.
[10:18] <Speljohan_Laptop> spore was a terrible game
[10:18] * Malikat wears cat's tail as a headband
[10:18] <TKoopa> you could blow up shit, or, or you could like, be a diplomat
[10:18] * Cat *purrs*
[10:18] <Cat> give it back Malikat
[10:18] <liq3> TKoopa: DAMN MAN, THAT'S DEEP.
[10:18] <liq3> SO MUCH CHIOCE>
[10:18] * Malikat cowers from cat
[10:18] <TKoopa> Spore was one of this biggest letdowns this past decade
[10:19] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's like "BRB PROMISING TONS OF THINGS AND HYPING, THEN PROCEED TO MAKE IT MORE SHALLOW THAN GEORGE BUSH'S LIES"
[10:19] <Azathoth> yep
[10:19] <Malikat> but it keeps my face warm!
[10:19] <TKoopa> worse even than Fable
[10:19] <Azathoth> spore made me crai
[10:19] * Cat purrs harder
[10:19] <TKoopa> at least Fable didn't make me cry
[10:19] * Cat uses paws
[10:19] <Azathoth> daaawww cat is so cute
[10:19] <Speljohan_Laptop> <TKoopa> you could blow up shit, or, or you could like, be a diplomat
[10:19] * Malikat gives tail and hides D:
[10:19] <Speljohan_Laptop> sounds like every single 4x game
[10:19] <TKoopa> hahah yep
[10:19] <Speljohan_Laptop> :D
[10:19] <Azathoth> man
[10:19] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: AI War. ;P
[10:19] * Cat looks at her tail
[10:19] <Speljohan_Laptop> AI War was interesting
[10:19] <Azathoth> i'd like to see a really good real time 4X game
[10:19] <TKoopa> sounds like every game ever
[10:20] <liq3> Your choices in that are "blow shit up, and blow shit up better"
[10:20] <liq3> xD
[10:20] * Cat bites her tail
[10:20] * Malikat sneaks up and removes drool from tail
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> sins of a solar empire Azathoth
[10:20] <Cat> om nom nom
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's really good tbh
[10:20] <Malikat> ew.
[10:20] <Malikat> Sins was horrible
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> no
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> it was awesome
[10:20] <Azathoth> sins is fun, but it's more like an RTS over multiple maps
[10:20] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: AI War was good until I realised every game was excatly the fuckcing same.
[10:20] <Malikat> yeah if you like the same fucking battle every damn game
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> loll liq3
[10:20] <Shadaez> I have AI war and want to play with someone
[10:20] <Malikat> then you'd like sins
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> sins is not an rts really
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's a 4x/rts hybrid
[10:20] <TKoopa> Videogame choices have always ranged between "blow shit up" and "sneak that shit" but always fall on the blow shit up side of the spectrum
[10:20] <Malikat> sins is a shitty 4x and a shitty rts
[10:20] <Azathoth> only the 4X aspects of it were a bit dumbed down
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> and then there's sims TKoopa
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> 3 choices
[10:20] <vurtual> Malikat
[10:20] <Speljohan_Laptop> loll
[10:21] <liq3> TKoopa: nah. Thief 2 was "sneak, and sneak better" :P
[10:21] <vurtual> I know some people who play that
[10:21] <bildramer> lol
[10:21] <TKoopa> hahahahahaha
[10:21] <vurtual> :'(
[10:21] <TKoopa> oh yeah, be fucking bored
[10:21] <Malikat> the 4x parts of sins were so retardedly simple that it was a bother
[10:21] <Malikat> and the rts of sins always played exactly the same every game
[10:21] <Azathoth> some kind of real time 4x game on the scale of civilization would be neat
[10:21] <TKoopa> liq3 You see, Thief, Deux Ex and those games had integrity
[10:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> nah Azathoth
[10:21] <liq3> civ scale is?
[10:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> it wouldn't work
[10:21] <vurtual> it would be impossible Azathoth
[10:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> because
[10:21] <TKoopa> and stuck to their goal
[10:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> you'd have to micro so fucking much
[10:21] <vurtual> liq3, the whole planet
[10:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> like
[10:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> too much
[10:21] <vurtual> and you're a country
[10:21] <liq3> vurtual: that'd be pretty sick.-
[10:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> constant extreme multitasking
[10:21] <TKoopa> yeck!@
[10:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> it would be too tedious
[10:22] <liq3> oh
[10:22] <Azathoth> obviously they'd have to dumb down a lot of aspects
[10:22] <TKoopa> Multitasking is for work
[10:22] <TKoopa> not for fun
[10:22] <liq3> well
[10:22] <Azathoth> but i think it could work
[10:22] <liq3> you'd design the game to have tons of automation.
[10:22] <Speljohan_Laptop> then you haven't ever played an intense rts TKoopa
[10:22] <Speljohan_Laptop> :P
[10:22] <TKoopa> Ohhhh I have
[10:22] <Azathoth> it would be really fun watching your little cities grow in real time
[10:22] <TKoopa> but I will never call it fun
[10:22] <Azathoth> and you send armies out and watch them march across the world
[10:22] <Speljohan_Laptop> i agree prty much TKoopa
[10:22] <TKoopa> heh
[10:23] <Speljohan_Laptop> mmmm..... 5 days to go..
[10:23] <Azathoth> although my ideal RT4X would span multiple planets and include space and land combat
[10:23] <liq3> One thing that pisses me off about SC2, is that they keep trying to make it "skillful" from a APM perspective (e.g. making spawn larva hard). I'm thinking "fuck, there should be as little clicking as fucking possible. That's not the game at all. Tactics and fucking strategy is."
[10:23] <Speljohan_Laptop> my ideal rts would remove all sci-fi elements
[10:23] <TKoopa> What we need is a game that makes you feel like a bad ass leader without cramming shit down your throat OR spoon feeding it to you
[10:23] <Speljohan_Laptop> i want moar historical/fantasy
[10:24] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: bah fucking setting.
[10:24] <Azathoth> you can never have enough sci fi
[10:24] <liq3> I just want good gameplay mechanics.
[10:24] <Azathoth> but personally i think we need more steampunk and cyberpunk games
[10:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> meh Azathoth
[10:24] <vurtual> my ideal RTS would be total annihilation mixed with civilization in a whole solar system.
[10:24] <Azathoth> you don't see a lot of those. it's all sci fi or fantasy
[10:24] <TKoopa> Azathoth agreed
[10:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> i never liked futuristic shit
[10:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> at all
[10:24] <bildramer> so I'm writing a math exam
[10:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> except star trek
[10:24] <bildramer> protips plz
[10:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> !
[10:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> i totally want either a good star trek rts OR a star trek sandbox similar to morrowind
[10:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> :D
[10:24] <Azathoth> although cyberpunk seems to have been a pretty popular genre in the early 2000s. not so much anymore
[10:25] <TKoopa> Fads come and go
[10:25] <Azathoth> steampunk has never really been popular, which is sad because the few times it has been tried, it came out pretty bad
[10:25] * mnjiman (Mibbit@d24-57-104-173.home.cgocable.net) has joined #minecraft
[10:25] * Cat chases her tail
[10:25] <liq3> Azathoth: You read GirlGenius?
[10:25] <Azathoth> one game that comes to mind is rise of legends
[10:25] <Azathoth> no
[10:25] <Azathoth> i don't even know what that is
[10:25] <bildramer> lo
[10:25] <liq3> It's a steampunk comic made of win and awesome sauce.

[10:25] <Azathoth> name sounds gay :P
[10:26] <liq3> yeh the name is pretty gay, comic is epic tho. :P
[10:26] <TKoopa> We need a good western RPG that doesn't borrow every element from LOTR
[10:26] <liq3> Gah.
[10:26] <liq3> We need more Morrowind Style RPGs.
[10:26] <liq3> Fucking oblivion sucked.
[10:26] <TKoopa> I liked morrowind's dwarves
[10:26] <TKoopa> See, that's original;
[10:26] <liq3> :D
[10:26] <bildramer> I should play morrowind
[10:26] <bildramer> :/
[10:26] <TKoopa> yes
[10:27] <TKoopa> yes you should
[10:27] <bildramer> yes I should
[10:27] * Bomb_Spammer (chatzilla@S010600262d6df833.ss.shawcable.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:27] <bildramer> I hurd itz epic lol
[10:27] <liq3> Morrowind = best fucking RPG... ever.
[10:27] <TKoopa> western rpg
[10:27] <TKoopa> best wester-- who am I kidding
[10:27] <TKoopa> best RPG
[10:27] <bildramer> So yeah, what about expansions etc.?
[10:27] <liq3> :D
[10:27] <Azathoth> my ideal RPG would be a mix of oblivion/morrowind and kotor, but in a hard sci fi settings
[10:27] <TrueWolves> hard sci fi isn't common though
[10:27] <TrueWolves> 3=
[10:27] <Azathoth> with some intense space combat as well
[10:27] <liq3> hard scifi is?
[10:28] <bildramer> wut
[10:28] <TrueWolves> where the technology is based on real life concepts and tech
[10:28] <Azathoth> science fiction with a little more scientific plausibility
[10:28] <liq3> bah.
[10:28] <Azathoth> yeah
[10:28] <liq3> That'd make a boring game imo.
[10:28] <TKoopa> My idea RPG is morrowind on crack, mixed with Thief, KOTOR, and a bunch of other good shit
[10:28] <bildramer> well
[10:28] <bildramer> just add nanobots
[10:28] <TKoopa> ideal*
[10:28] <liq3> Well, the only way I could see it being not boring is with the ability to like, fight ON planets and shit.
[10:28] <Azathoth> it doesn't have to be completely realistic. FTL travel and artificial gravity are necessities for the sci fi genre, but pretty difficult in reality
[10:29] <TKoopa> artificial gravity is an odd thing
[10:29] <liq3> Azathoth: well it's stuff like, in reality, things like fighters are more or less pointless.
[10:29] <TrueWolves> FreeFall is the "hardest" sci fi comic I know (I like hard scifi) but it has a furry character in it (mind you, a lot more realistic one then 90% of other such characters at least)
[10:29] <TrueWolves> I love that comic
[10:29] <TKoopa> has anyone made a successful sci-fi without it?
[10:29] <TrueWolves> a clean joke in EVERY strip, 3 times a week
[10:29] <TrueWolves> never once missed.
[10:29] <liq3> clean? meh. :(
[10:29] <liq3> :P
[10:29] <Azathoth> but anyway. this game would take you to multiple different planets, which could basically be a bunch of (smaller) versions of the oblivion world
[10:29] <Cat> Best comic ever ;) > http://nedroid.com/2009/05/party-cat-full-series/
[10:29] <bildramer> bbl school
[10:29] <bildramer> rofl party cat
[10:29] <TrueWolves> by clean I mean the comic manages to avoid falling in to sex jokes
[10:30] <bildramer> that is epic
[10:30] <bildramer> wait
[10:30] <bildramer> who removed my voice?
[10:30] <bildramer> oh nvm
[10:30] <liq3> Azathoth: Yes that'd be fun.
[10:30] <TrueWolves> ...
[10:30] <TrueWolves> any voice I hand out is a joke
[10:30] <TrueWolves> and it temporary
[10:30] <Azathoth> as you fly between planets, random encounters can occur where you have to engage in ship to ship action, including piloting ships and boarding actions
[10:30] <liq3> stuff like sending boarding ships onto capital ships then having little fights on them.
[10:30] <liq3> o.O
[10:30] <liq3> would be epic.
[10:30] <TKoopa> how about an FPS MMO sci-fi with planetwide RTS elements?
[10:30] <liq3> no "we attach and a little bar fills up" shit like in homeworld.
[10:30] <TKoopa> like planetside, but good
[10:31] <Azathoth> i think it would be so fucking epic if you had your own ship like in mass effect, and you had to actually fight to protect it
[10:31] <liq3> and you need like pilots and shit to actually capture the capitol ship.

[10:35] <Dommys> ;D
[10:36] <Azathoth> i want to play a steampunk game on a water world
[10:36] <Azathoth> instead of the usual airships and shit
[10:36] <Azathoth> you have submarines and ships
[10:37] <TrueWolves> hmm
[10:37] <TrueWolves> How do I get the game to run threw the stream?
[10:37] <Azathoth> and epic floating cities
[10:37] <Azathoth> what game, truewolves?
[10:37] <Azathoth> oh
[10:37] <Azathoth> i thought you said steam XD
[10:37] <Azathoth> i have no idea
[10:37] <Shadaez> procaster?
[10:37] <TrueWolves> yes
[10:38] <TrueWolves> I'm doing a Hardcore run of Cave Story on mic crap computer
[10:38] <Malikat> TrueWolves: it needs to be a game that uses directx or opengl
[10:38] <TrueWolves> for just an hour to test it out.
[10:38] <TrueWolves> ...
[10:38] <Shadaez> either use the game mode, which I havn't had any luck with, or play windowed and resize it to the window
[10:38] <TrueWolves> figures
[10:38] <TrueWolves> -.-
[10:38] <Malikat> which it likely is
[10:38] <Malikat> and then you select game
[10:38] <Shadaez> turn off the aspect ratio lock in the settings, first
[10:38] <Malikat> start the game, open procaster, click the game

[10:40] <TrueWolves> I have the game and procaster open
[10:40] <Azathoth> another interesting setting that i feel needs some exploration would be a medieval (NOT fantasy) setting which takes place hundreds of years after some apocalyptic event where knowledge and technology was lost and humanity has reverted back to feudal dark ages
[10:41] <Azathoth> ancient relics would be highly valued and powerful if they work.

[10:42] <Azathoth> it would be epic
[10:42] <TrueWolves> something that needs to be exploired more is fake magic
[10:42] <TrueWolves> even in magic settings, not everything people thinks works should work
[10:42] <TrueWolves> a village may have a major as hell ritual that may do nothing at all
[10:43] <TrueWolves> just the 2 times they didn't do it, concouncadentualy, something bad happened.
[10:43] <vurtual> bullet making is easy
[10:43] <vurtual> I mean, how can people FORGET that
[10:43] <vurtual> most of our tehcnology is remembered
[10:43] <vurtual> and well-backed-up information
[10:43] <Azathoth> in the 40k setting, most technological knowledge has been lost, so to get their ancient tech in order, they have basically memorized what to do in the form of rituals
[10:43] <TrueWolves> but in reality, the ritual? does nothing.
[10:43] <Azathoth> so they light incense and all kinds of crazy shit and do prayers
[10:44] <Azathoth> while repairing machinery
[10:44] <vurtual> yeah but that's not likely to happen irl
[10:44] <Azathoth> it's interesting, but a little more high tech than what i had in mind
[10:44] <vurtual> I mean, really, all one would have to do is find one of the many, many surviving stores of all human knowledge.
[10:44] <TrueWolves> ...
[10:44] <TrueWolves> CaveStory won't work in the live stream
[10:44] <TrueWolves> ;.;
[10:44] <vurtual> oh hey look guys we found a wikipedia server
[10:45] <Azathoth> i'd like to see a complete devolution of society back to medieval ages in which working technology is ridiculously rare
[10:45] <vurtual> :D
[10:45] <vurtual> Azathoth, humans themselves would have to die off first.
[10:45] <Azathoth> not really
[10:45] <liq3> vurtual: the thing is the only reason it happened is because they're crazy as shit and won't let people invent/improve stuff.
[10:45] <TrueWolves> have them die off then
[10:45] <TrueWolves> for the added wtf
[10:45] <Azathoth> it could happen if all major cities are somehow completely destroyed
[10:45] <vurtual> I mean, it would mean that everyone would have to instantly die without being able to pass off basic concepts like "how to use a computer"
[10:45] <Azathoth> and the power grid is completely fubar

[10:46] <Azathoth> computers would be worthless

[10:46] <liq3> yeh
[10:46] <Azathoth> they'd run out of fuel in a few years
[10:46] <liq3> computers are pretty worthless if shit goes dowmn.
[10:46] <vurtual> in a few centuries maybe
[10:46] <vurtual> I mean, cars aren't very useful without the roads, right?
[10:46] * TrueWolves sighs
[10:46] <vurtual> in order to nuke the grid entirely, you'd have to do that.
[10:46] <liq3> 4 wheel drives are.
[10:46] <vurtual> What about solar panels?
[10:46] <vurtual> well yeah, but average commuting would be mostly useless.
[10:46] <Azathoth> naturally there could be small holdout communities
[10:47] <vurtual> large ones.
[10:47] <Azathoth> where they have maintained and horded technology and knowledge
[10:47] <vurtual> also you can pretty much make a generator out of anything.
[10:47] <TrueWolves> Anyone know a way to get CaveStory to run threw ProCastor?
[10:47] <Azathoth> having raided libraries and such to preserve the knowledge
[10:47] <liq3> lemon!
[10:47] <liq3> lemon powered generator!1
[10:47] <vurtual> I mean seriously, to get rid of all of your advanced technology, you'd have to completely destroy ALL the factories
[10:47] <Adura> http://Iemonparty.org
[10:47] <vurtual> rip out every last power line
[10:47] <Azathoth> but the majority of survivors are left without power, many of them die off from radiation, disease, and starvation
[10:47] <vurtual> and everything else
[10:47] <vurtual> radiation death?
[10:47] <Azathoth> several hundred years later, knowledge is forgotten and people have reverted to substinence farming
[10:47] <vurtual> How many nukes did you drop?
[10:47] <vurtual> The world would explode.
[10:48] <Azathoth> subwhatever
[10:48] <liq3> no
[10:48] <liq3> you could nuke the entire planet with every nke
[10:48] * Maart3h (Maart3h@86.92.114.65) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[10:48] <liq3> and it wouldn't explode.
[10:48] <vurtual> it would be very worse
[10:48] <liq3> :/
[10:48] <vurtual> in several hundred years we'd completely repair everything probably.
[10:48] <liq3> you'd just get nuclear winter and shit.
[10:48] <Azathoth> vurtual, you're wrong
[10:48] <vurtual> yeah nuclear winter
[10:48] <Azathoth> you don't need to destroy all factories, you just need to shut down society
[10:48] <vurtual> out the butts
[10:48] <vurtual> "shut down society"
[10:48] <vurtual> How do you "shut down society"
[10:48] <Azathoth> by nuking most of the major cities
[10:49] <Azathoth> no government. no communication. mass chaos
[10:49] <Azathoth> it would be anarchy
[10:49] <vurtual> they're mostly residential and business.
[10:49] <liq3> oh man that reminds me of this creepy as shit movi.
[10:49] <vurtual> nuke all the forms of government?
[10:49] <Azathoth> no one would go to work and make new shit
[10:49] <vurtual> Destroy every last local mayor?
[10:49] <vurtual> Every last potential president?
[10:49] <liq3> there was this virus that gained the ability to well, kill people.
[10:49] <Azathoth> no, vurtual, you wouldn't need to do that
[10:49] * Malikat brings cat along to a new fortress
[10:49] <liq3> it could manifest anywhere there was wifi.
[10:49] <Azathoth> you'd jsut destroy the infrastructure
[10:49] <vurtual> well screw your mass city nukings, we have the ability to sustain this whole state off local wells and generators.
[10:49] <Azathoth> it really wouldn't be that hard
[10:49] <vurtual> bring on the mutants.
[10:49] <liq3> super mutants!
[10:49] <TrueWolves> huh
[10:50] <TrueWolves> In a Zombie appoclypse game I run
[10:50] <TrueWolves> the group /has/ guns, but they use mostly melee weapons and ANY form of armor then can get when fighting the zombies, as guns are best saved for those who can use them back
[10:50] <TrueWolves> IE other human groups.
[10:50] <liq3> ^
[10:50] <TrueWolves> so there has been a few funny cases where 1 person tryed out some heavy midevil armor
[10:51] <Azathoth> so anyway. civilization has fallen into chaos for a few hundred years. it begins to emerge again in feudalism
[10:51] <TrueWolves> though they usualy just use sports equipment or kavlar, military grade stuff if they have any.
[10:51] <Azathoth> win

[10:52] <Azathoth> nope
[10:52] <TrueWolves> the govement took a while to die off though, but it adventualy did
[10:52] <vurtual> you guys all have very bad views of this
[10:53] <Azathoth> i really don't see what your argument is
[10:53] <Azathoth> you can't really believe that after some major global crisis like a nuclear war or pandemic that life would just continue as noraml
[10:54] <Azathoth> anarchy would certainly ensue. if government was wiped out, sure local government would take over, but that would sure as hell lead to unrest at the abuses that would occur
[10:54] <Azathoth> no one would let a mayor or city council take complete control

[10:55] <vurtual> rome was annihilated
[10:55] <TrueWolves> It's going to be low quality, becuase my computer is SHIT but meh
[10:55] <Azathoth> that's one city
[10:55] <vurtual> rome the massive empire.
[10:55] <vurtual> became practically nothing
[10:55] <Azathoth> it wasn't annihilated
[10:55] <Azathoth> it fractured
[10:55] <TrueWolves> Rome died
[10:55] <TrueWolves> Very slowly
[10:55] <TrueWolves> painfuly
[10:55] <Azathoth> and it was a slow process
[10:55] <vurtual> countries do not die fast.
[10:55] <Azathoth> it wasn't a pandemic or a nuclear war

[10:57] <Azathoth> which could easily happen by simply killing off the skilled labor required to keep these things running

[10:57] <Azathoth> and these industries support each other
[10:58] <TrueWolves> Dommys, I'll start live streaming under TrueWolves in 3 minutes
[10:58] <Azathoth> modern society wouldn't hold together as well with horse couriers as ancient empires did

[11:00] <TrueWolves> Malikat, want to watch me steam? =3
[11:00] <Azathoth> also, another interesting setting would be a medieval one but with a zombie outbreak
[11:00] <Azathoth> like a modern zombie outbreak. not gay "oooh necromancer" zombies

[11:01] <Azathoth> but the outlying villages and farms would be easy prey
[11:02] <Azathoth> and people would eventually have to leave their fortresses or starve
[11:02] <Azathoth> smaller castles could probably fall by the zombies simply piling up outside the walls
[11:03] <Azathoth> or breaking down the gates if they're weak

[11:03] <vurtual> until the dead pile higher than the walls
[11:03] <eZek0> Ah, long chat.
[11:03] <vurtual> and compact into a thick, bone ramp
[11:03] <eZek0> What'd I miss
[11:03] <Azathoth> they'd probably run out of food first, vurtual
[11:04] <vurtual> not if they have farms inside.
[11:04] <Azathoth> if a bunch of people from the countryside are able to escape inside the walls
[11:04] <Azathoth> typically castles do not have farms inside their walls
[11:04] <vurtual> but in an apocalypse!
[11:04] <Azathoth> you don't plan for an apocalypse
[11:04] <Azathoth> they could probably find room to plant a few gardens
[11:04] <Azathoth> but not enough to support large populations
[11:05] <Azathoth> and disease would also be a danger
[11:06] <Azathoth> so everyone would flock to the big cities only to find them completely surrounded by a horde of zombies. then they get raped and become zombies too
[11:06] <Azathoth> or if they make it through to the city, they find that the situation inside is pretty shitty, with everyone living in their own filth, starving, dieing of disease
[11:06] <Azathoth> or that due to some stupidity, the city was overrun
[11:07] <vurtual> Yes you do
[11:07] <Azathoth> some asshole lords would barracade themselves inside their estates with only their knights and servants and hoard their stockpiles for themselves
[11:07] <Azathoth> leaving their peasants to die at the gates
[11:08] <TrueWolves> http://www.livestream.com/truewolves
[11:08] <vurtual> I know many, many people who are zombie prepared
[11:08] <Azathoth> when they began to starve, they'd be forced to ride out into the horde
[11:08] <Azathoth> not in medieval times, vurtual
[11:08] <vurtual> They are always around
[11:08] <Azathoth> a bunch of heavy knights in full armor riding into a horde of zombies with lances and shit would be fucking amazing
[11:08] <Azathoth> how the fuck would you prepare for the zombie apocalypse in medieval times anyway, vurtual?
[11:08] <liq3> meh
[11:09] <liq3> i'd rather see an Aiel fight some zombies.
[11:09] <liq3> THAT would be amazing.
[11:09] <Azathoth> Aiel?
[11:09] <liq3> people from The Wheel of Time.
[11:09] <liq3> or a race of people anyway.
[11:09] <liq3> let me put it this way.
[11:09] <Azathoth> vurtual, it's not like you can stockpile food and medical supplies... because back then, you couldn't afford that much food and there were no medical supplies
[11:10] <liq3> At one point, a single Aiel, unarmed and unarmoured, takes out 8 full armoured trained swordsmens, by himeslf.
[11:10] <liq3> :P
[11:10] <Azathoth> as for weapons, there's not much that does a whole lot of good against zombies
[11:10] <Azathoth> and armor would be expensive
[11:10] <Azathoth> a peasant in medieval times would be completely unprepared for zombies
[11:10] <Azathoth> even if they wanted to be
[11:10] <liq3> axes.
[11:10] <liq3> cut it's head off.
[11:11] <Azathoth> and grain doesn't last quite as long as spam, and takes a larger space to store
[11:11] <Azathoth> it also needs to be processed
[11:11] <Azathoth> into food
[11:12] <TrueWolves> hm...
[11:12] <Azathoth> vurtual, do you realize how fucking annoying you're being?
[11:12] <TrueWolves> Hoping to get 3 viewers before I start, that's not going to happen huh?
[11:12] <Azathoth> my ideas are a lot more plausible than a fucking navy seal ninja who fights robots and shit
[11:12] <Roadcrosser> whatcha stereamin
[11:13] <liq3> Azathoth: What about a Doctor... That's also a ninja/
[11:13] <liq3> ?
[11:13] <Malikat> and a goddamn mick
[11:13] <Azathoth> suggest it to vurtual. he's the one with the ninja navy seal

[11:30] <Malikat> Sorry.
[11:30] <vurtual> WHY DOES SUPER MARIO CROSSOVERK EEP CRASHING
[11:30] <vurtual> THERE IS NO VALID REASON
[11:30] <Dommys> Super Mario Crossover keeps crashing because Notch is taking a break
[11:31] <Dommys> If you read his blog you'd know that
[11:31] <vurtual> ohnoooo
[11:31] <carllll> sorry my screen is to small to tell the difference in . and ,
[11:31] <vede> carllll, Notch decided to give Minecraft a rest, at least for a few months or so.

[11:43] <TrueWolves> wtf is this Manicdigger anyway?
[11:43] <TrueWolves> sounds like the cheapest rip off ever
[11:43] <Dommys> It's ripped off Minecraft source
[11:43] <Dommys> With shitty models for players
[11:44] <TrueWolves> but the source was never released to prevent that.
[11:44] <vede> TrueWolves, open source MC clone that only runs on Windows, is made by stupid people, and sucks.

[11:44] <Dommys> Well, they did what they did.

[11:54] <TrueWolves> He's just focused on Game maker
[11:54] <eZek0> Definitions of contribution on the Web: act of giving in common with others for a common purpose especially to a charity
[11:55] <eZek0> Saying things is pretty common.
[11:55] <eZek0> Usually has a common purpose.
[11:55] <TrueWolves> Just like Vis has contribued before as well, but only shouts out Beat Hazard after I told him of the game.
[11:55] <Dommys> Sure, but what I say has no value. :D
[11:55] <eZek0> Why not?
[11:55] <eZek0> :(
[11:55] <Dommys> Because I am a worthless being, who's only real value is to demean himself for others enjoyment
[11:55] <Dommys> :D
[11:55] <TrueWolves> any words that have scense behind them have value
[11:55] * Dommys dances for his Masta's
[11:55] <eZek0> That's a contribution.
[11:56] <TrueWolves> said calue can be almost nothing, but if there is nothing else to compair, then it's better then nothing.
[11:56] <Dommys> What I do barely affords my presence.
[11:56] <eZek0> TrueWolves: damn you for qdb. I'm on page 29 now, and it's 4AM.
[11:56] <Malikat> Dommys is a jester?
[11:56] <TrueWolves> value*

[11:56] <Dommys> Titan quest just finished
[11:56] <TrueWolves> I'd rather Dommys insanity then nothing at all
[11:56] <Dommys> :D
[11:56] <eZek0> Titan quest?
[11:56] <eZek0> The game?
[11:56] <Dommys> Who needs food when you have Electronic Sustenance!
[11:56] <TrueWolves> even if the insanity it's self has little value, again, little value > no value.
[11:56] <Dommys> Yeah.
[11:57] <Dommys> I just downloaded it and the expansion on steam
[11:57] <eZek0> I'm curious... since this server doesn't seem to have chanserv, how are people auto-opped?
[11:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol titan quest, the only good diablo 2 clone ever produced
[11:57] <Dommys> Esper does have ChanServ
[11:57] <eZek0> Oh.
[11:57] <eZek0> Speljohan_Laptop: Torchlight.
[11:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> tochlight sucked imo
[11:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> torchlight*
[11:58] <eZek0> To each their own.
[11:58] <Dommys> [03:36] * ChanServ gives channel operator status to TrueWolves
[11:58] <Dommys> Torchlight was bearable
[11:58] <TrueWolves> if there was no chanserv
[11:58] <TrueWolves> How can...
[11:58] <TrueWolves> I DO THIS
[11:58] * TrueWolves sets mode -o TrueWolves
[11:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> especially graphics style in torchlight was awful tbh
[11:58] <vurtual> also the channel is a year old now by the way
[11:58] <eZek0> Oh gawd.
[11:58] <TrueWolves> WEEE
[11:58] * ChanServ sets mode +o TrueWolves
[11:58] <Dommys> But lacking in class diversity in my opinion
[11:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> titan quest had awesome style
[11:58] <eZek0> Usually I see chanserv in the channel though
[11:58] <vurtual> that'd be silly
[11:58] <Dommys> That's optional
[11:58] <eZek0> Well if it's a registered channel
[11:58] <eZek0> it's better dat way
[11:59] <vurtual> nnot really, why?
[12:00] <eZek0> Magic. And it's just what I'm used to on other servers :p
[12:00] <vurtual> what servers

[12:07] <TrueWolves> oh.
[12:07] <TrueWolves> ._.
[12:07] <Malikat> apparently i'm too loud
[12:07] <Dommys> Malis dad said he's too loud
[12:07] <Dommys> And mali didn't tell him to piss off.
[12:07] <Dommys> Or that he's gay.
[12:07] <Malikat> i woke up my dad and his wife and she couldn't go back to sleep
[12:07] <Dommys> And that he should accep thte way he is
[12:07] <Malikat> my dad doesn't mind me
[12:07] <Malikat> his wife is fucking crazy psycho though
[12:07] <TrueWolves> Mali, 16?
[12:07] <Roadcrosser> MALIKAAAT
[12:08] <Roadcrosser> go stream
[12:08] * TrueWolves could check his interview results but those are mostly for survey data collection...
[12:08] <TrueWolves> That be rude
[12:08] * TrueWolves doesn't do it
[12:12] <vurtual> his wife?
[12:12] <vurtual> aka your mom?
[12:12] <vurtual> heheh, your mom.
[12:12] <Sa[i]nT> I've been sitting here for 4 hours..
[12:12] <Sa[i]nT> You know what I am doing..
[12:12] <Malikat> TrueWolves: 22
[12:13] <Sa[i]nT> Trying to find some -freaking- reason to use Matrix Algebra.
[12:13] <Roadcrosser> stweam mawikat, stweam
[12:13] <Malikat> his wife, aka my step-mom, i suppose.
[12:13] <Malikat> Roadcrosser: i can't, i got yelled at.
[12:13] <Sa[i]nT> Like, one damn example that would be relevant.
[12:13] <Malikat> unless i stream without talking.
[12:13] <Roadcrosser> aww
[12:13] <TrueWolves> huh
[12:13] <Roadcrosser> bubububut
[12:13] <TrueWolves> I feel like an ass for underestimating your age
[12:13] <Roadcrosser> talking is the main reason
[12:13] <Malikat> rofl thanks TrueWolves
[12:13] <Roadcrosser> im watchong
[12:13] <Sa[i]nT> How old is he/she?
[12:14] <Roadcrosser> just lower the volume of recording on your mic
[12:14] <Malikat> uh
[12:14] * TrueWolves still finds it Animator is one of the youngest in this WHOLE CHANNEL and is by far one of the most mature in the community.
[12:14] * Malikat facepalms at Roadcrosser
[12:14] <Dommys> lol@ roadcrosser
[12:14] <LG_Legacy> animator isn't even here/.
[12:14] <TrueWolves> finds it crazy*
[12:14] <Roadcrosser> ?
[12:14] <Roadcrosser> what
[12:14] <Sa[i]nT> If he/she is hot/ugly can only be condusive to his or her emotion state (maybe).
[12:14] <Roadcrosser> did I get it right
[12:14] <TrueWolves> That doesn't stop him from being a regular of the channel
[12:14] <Roadcrosser> malikat?
[12:15] <Sa[i]nT> Malikat is a very unisex name.
[12:15] <Dommys> His parents in another room, in his house..
[12:15] <Malikat> Roadcrosser: the problem is that my bedroom is right below theirs and there is an air condition vent linking the two
[12:15] <vurtual> animator isn't THAT mature.
[12:15] <Dommys> Are overhearing him talk to livestream
[12:15] * LG_Legacy glares at vurtual
[12:15] <Malikat> changing the volume settings on my computer won't alter anything.
[12:15] <Dommys> So he can play, he just can't talk
[12:15] <Roadcrosser> oh
[12:15] <Sa[i]nT> Could be the temptings of a female fox, or the calm gender curiousities of the confused male.
[12:15] <Dommys> Mal, move your pc to the basement, yo
[12:15] <Roadcrosser> YES
[12:15] <vurtual> Glaring at me?
[12:15] <Malikat> Dommys: tempting.
[12:15] <Roadcrosser> do it
[12:15] <Roadcrosser> and get on a serer
[12:15] <vurtual> Is animator your new diety?
[12:15] <Roadcrosser> if possible
[12:15] <Dommys> Then grow your beard out
[12:15] <vurtual> Gonna make a golden figurine of him, eh?
[12:15] <Malikat> Sa[i]nT: i am a guys, if you are musing about me?
[12:16] <Malikat> a guy* fgdpg
[12:16] <Sa[i]nT> LmAo.

[12:16] <Malikat> PyroPyro where is cat
[12:16] <LG_Legacy> o_o
[12:16] <Sa[i]nT> I am a Guys, you musta love me.
[12:16] <vurtual> also, wait
[12:16] <Dommys> No..
[12:16] <vurtual> "temptings of a female fox"
[12:16] <vurtual> what
[12:16] <Dommys> Mali was saying "I am a guise"
[12:16] <Malikat> THIS IS A GUISE
[12:16] <Dommys> You just didn't get it.
[12:16] <Sa[i]nT> Mali is obviously confused.
[12:16] * Malikat hurts himself in his confusion!
[12:17] <Sa[i]nT> See.
[12:17] <Sa[i]nT> That's like 5 Hp.
[12:17] <Malikat> >`:
[12:17] <Dommys> Sa[i]nt is obviously confused
[12:17] <Sa[i]nT> And he is a commoner, so that is almost instant death.
[12:17] <Malikat> okay i'm gonna silently stream.
[12:17] <Roadcrosser> PyroPyro is a cat wearing a pyro suit
[12:17] <Malikat> that sounds like it would make for an insanely cute drawing
[12:17] <liq3> No it wouldn't. Really. DON'T DO IT.
[12:18] <Malikat> like a little :3 cat wearing human sized pyro stuff
[12:18] <Malikat> i can't draw so i won't do it anyway.
[12:18] <Sa[i]nT> Not human sized.
[12:18] <liq3> http://miscellanea.wellingtongrey.net/2006/12/11/cats-not-that-funny/

[12:19] <TrueWolves> translate back
[12:19] <TrueWolves> that is all
[12:19] <Malikat> unfortunately, malika is arabic for queen
[12:19] <vurtual> okay and I quote
[12:19] <Sa[i]nT> Like.. Queen kittie.
[12:19] <vurtual> "one of my dwarves embarked in a minor river wtf"
[12:19] <vurtual> "A LONGNOSE GAR IS MY EXPIDITION LEADER"

[12:20] <Malikat> they don't have a translate to yiddish. >:
[12:20] <TrueWolves> Google should
[12:20] <Malikat> oy vey
[12:20] <Malikat> they're such goyim
[12:20] <Malikat> it's meshugenah
[12:20] <Sa[i]nT> Maybe google doesnt want us to believe in Yiddish.
[12:20] <Sa[i]nT> And if Google is the hub of all knowledge, then whatever they dont believe in.
[12:20] <Malikat> yids did 9/11
[12:20] <Sa[i]nT> I don't believe in.
[12:22] <outsomnia> ???????? ???? ???????????????
[12:22] <Sa[i]nT> I was showing my redneck friends M and String Theory videos...
[12:23] <Sa[i]nT> And one of them actually said. "No one believes that Science mumbo-jumbo".
[12:23] <Sa[i]nT> I kinda died alittle inside.
[12:23] <vurtual> what
[12:23] <vurtual> what
[12:23] <TrueWolves> xkcd disapointed this time
[12:23] <vurtual> why would anyone do that
[12:23] <Sa[i]nT> They wanted to talk to me about God.
[12:23] <TrueWolves> ...
[12:23] <TrueWolves> ow
[12:23] <vurtual> can you pull?
[12:23] <Sa[i]nT> I guess to cast out my heathen ways of magical Science.
[12:24] <TrueWolves> ...
[12:24] <vurtual> even I'm technically religious and
[12:24] <vurtual> I want to punch your friends
[12:24] <vurtual> very hard
[12:24] <vurtual> with a kinfe
[12:24] <vurtual> so it's stabbing them
[12:24] <Sa[i]nT> I just walked out, I was like WHOA.
[12:24] <eZek0> hahah
[12:24] * TrueWolves sets mode +v vurtual
[12:24] <Sa[i]nT> I go through all this trouble of hooking up my Vizio big screen.
[12:24] <eZek0> oh god
[12:24] <eZek0> vurt +v?
[12:24] <Sa[i]nT> Hook up the laptop, hunt for an hour for the S-Video cable.
[12:25] <vurtual> intolerance of ultimate superstitious fear of logic is apparently how you move up in the world.
[12:25] <Sa[i]nT> Play this awesome film of String Theory (Big fan by the way).
[12:25] <vurtual> play a glorious dawn
[12:25] <LG_Legacy> We only voice cool people
[12:25] <Sa[i]nT> And they wanna lecture me on how -I- am wrong.
[12:25] <eZek0> I'm cool :D
[12:25] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjb

[12:26] <vurtual> if they hate on carl sagan, just say that he hints on being religious
[12:26] * LG_Legacy sets mode -v eZek0
[12:26] <LG_Legacy> I mean what?
[12:26] <eZek0> awww.
[12:26] <TrueWolves> I'm just doing it as a joke and limiting my self to 2~4 at a time.
[12:26] * LG_Legacy sets mode +v eZek0
[12:26] <Malikat> i need a voice
[12:26] <eZek0> :)
[12:26] <LG_Legacy> As long as it's temp i don't care
[12:26] <vurtual> like how he secretly quotes bits of the bible in individual phrases
[12:26] <TrueWolves> IE: if there is 4 people, I won't voice anyone until someone loses it
[12:26] <outsomnia> Does this channel ever reach +m anyways?
[12:26] <TrueWolves> They are ALL temp
[12:26] <Sa[i]nT> I want a freakin' plus symbol.
[12:26] <TrueWolves> that's part of the fun!
[12:26] <outsomnia> Actually, does esper even support +m?
[12:26] <Sa[i]nT> I wish I could get two after my name.
[12:26] <vurtual> yes it does
[12:26] <eZek0> Who would be non-temped voice?
[12:26] <TrueWolves> it does, in the case that I use it I'll remove the voices.
[12:27] <vurtual> herro my name is C can I also get this plus plus?
[12:27] <vurtual> lame.
[12:27] <Sa[i]nT> Like Sa[i]nT++.
[12:27] * Malikat glares at vurtual
[12:27] <Sa[i]nT> That way I would be l337
[12:27] <TrueWolves> I'll ask Siiseli on non-temp voicing people who've been here for a whole year with out causing a serius problem
[12:27] <LG_Legacy> serius
[12:27] <vurtual> sirius problems for sirius radios.
[12:27] <TrueWolves> serious*
[12:27] <TrueWolves> damn it
[12:27] <TrueWolves> I failed twice
[12:27] <LG_Legacy> serius*
[12:28] <TrueWolves> ... wait no
[12:28] <TrueWolves> I spelt it right that time.
[12:28] <vurtual> serum
[12:28] <vurtual> A serum problem.
[12:28] <Sa[i]nT> If they really wanna speak leet, it should be.
[12:28] <eZek0> You spelled it right when you corrected
[12:28] <eZek0> Op being troll :)
[12:28] <vurtual> ops have to be troll in order to be good ops
[12:28] <vurtual> or everyone finds them really, really dumb.
[12:28] <Sa[i]nT> Man, I am so \0x108\0x101\0x101\0x116
[12:28] <LG_Legacy> I'm a sarcastic asshole.
[12:28] <LG_Legacy> It's my job :l
[12:28] <vurtual> Yes it is, op.
[12:28] <TrueWolves> I wasn't trolling
[12:28] <TrueWolves> My spelling is damn horrid.
[12:28] <Sa[i]nT> I eat trolls for breakfast.
[12:28] <eZek0> I was referring to LG, TrueWolves
[12:29] <TrueWolves> ah
[12:29] <Sa[i]nT> They taste like sarcasm and stress.
[12:29] <vurtual> I used to be sarcastic and generally unlikable.
[12:29] <vurtual> Now I'm just senile. :(
[12:29] <LG_Legacy> Though to be honest, i'm just fucking with him.
[12:29] <TrueWolves> LG's a preaty cool guy, what trolls as op and an't afraid of nothing
[12:29] <vurtual> The best I've done is like, telling my friend that there's a girl naked on my floor.
[12:29] <vurtual> and he left.
[12:29] <eZek0> nice try
[12:29] <TrueWolves> hmm...
[12:30] <Sa[i]nT> I have a headache. Too much humanity.
[12:30] <Sa[i]nT> My... only... weakness.
[12:30] <vurtual> dragon is a pretty cool guy, eh misquotes me-mes and doesn't afraid of anything
[12:30] <eZek0> Go kill some babies
[12:30] <eZek0> was dragon his old name?
[12:30] <Sa[i]nT> And as I said that, my windows7 changed into a dramatic background.
[12:30] * TrueWolves can't think of anyone that fits that no major problem/1 year thing besides Drakkar, vede, and himself... a LOT of people are nearing their 11th and 12th months ends though, so in time.
[12:30] <TrueWolves> Was Dragon's who's old name?
[12:31] <vurtual> no, his real name is drake
[12:31] <eZek0> Ah right
[12:31] <eZek0> Drake, dragon
[12:31] <eZek0> Hurr hurr.
[12:31] <TrueWolves> oh
[12:31] <TrueWolves> me.
[12:31] <LG_Legacy> Vede is pretty cool.
[12:31] <vurtual> and misquoting is the meme you know
[12:31] <Sa[i]nT> >.>
[12:31] <TrueWolves> Well then.
[12:31] <vurtual> halo is a pretty cool guy
[12:31] <vurtual> eh kills aleins and doesn't afraid of anything
[12:31] <vede> TrueWolves, no major problem/1 year thing?
[12:31] <LG_Legacy> Don't we have a rule against meme spam?
[12:31] <TrueWolves> We haven't enforced it in...
[12:31] <eZek0> If we do, we shouldn;t
[12:31] <Sa[i]nT> You know what I freaking HATE.
[12:31] * TrueWolves checks
[12:31] <vurtual> Ain't spam if you're likin' it, baby.
[12:31] <TrueWolves> like 8 months
[12:32] <TrueWolves> We never had a problem with it after enforcing it a few times.
[12:32] <Sa[i]nT> That "Meme" got chosen to represent the internet's most popular fashions.
[12:32] <TrueWolves> But it was never a formal rule.
[12:32] <LG_Legacy> Meh
[12:32] <Sa[i]nT> Like seriously, have you said that word out loud?
[12:32] <TrueWolves> ... We? I was never an op back then
[12:32] <LG_Legacy> If i see people chaining again though. :l
[12:32] * TrueWolves sets mode -o TrueWolves
[12:32] <eZek0> "meem"
[12:32] <LG_Legacy> Oh no
[12:32] <LG_Legacy> The world is going to end
[12:32] * LG_Legacy sets mode -o LG_Legacy
[12:32] <vurtual> Anyways all your base are belong to us because the internet is serious business lolololol rofl rotfl lmao omg wtf bbq.
[12:32] * vede removes channel operator status from vede
[12:32] <Sa[i]nT> Like wow, dude, I got this new video it's the hottest "MEME".
[12:32] <Sa[i]nT> Buzz kill.
[12:32] * ChanServ sets mode +v LG_Legacy
[12:33] <vurtual> It's the ultimate cover, though.
[12:33] <TrueWolves> alright...
[12:33] <vurtual> The world's greatest minds, considered the nonexistant male equivelant of the texting teen girl.
[12:33] <Malikat> if you know the original meaning of a meme
[12:33] <Malikat> it kind of fits mostly
[12:33] <vurtual> My ultimate xanatos gambit.
[12:33] <eZek0> It feels weird seeing TrueWolves without an @ next to his name
[12:33] <LG_Legacy> So yeah about cheese20
[12:33] <vede> TrueWolves, Eagle's been here for quite a while. Dunno if he's still, like, actually here or not, though.
[12:33] <Malikat> better than when everything in the universe is called a viral
[12:33] <vurtual> it feels weird seeing TrueWolves do administration
[12:33] <Malikat> chesse20 you mean?
[12:34] <TrueWolves> eZek0, I'm still getting used to having it next to my name
[12:34] <LG_Legacy> mhhm
[12:34] <eZek0> What about chesse?
[12:34] <vede> So has liq3.
[12:34] <TrueWolves> Hell, just having a + is weird for me.
[12:34] <vurtual> THIS GUY IS LIKING A GAME HE DIDN'T THINK ABOUT LIKING, OR THE GAME IS POPULAR
[12:34] <vurtual> viralviralviral
[12:34] <LG_Legacy> That trolling has gotten way out of hand on him.
[12:34] <eZek0> voice isn't that special.
[12:34] <vede> Parthon has been here just as long as we have, TrueWolves.
[12:34] <Malikat> it feels weird seeing TrueWolves alive
[12:34] <liq3> vede: what about me?
[12:34] <TrueWolves> Parthon!
[12:34] <vurtual> when did I join this train anyways.
[12:34] <TrueWolves> yes yes he has
[12:34] <vede> liq3, you're a #minecraft veteran.

[12:35] <TrueWolves> XD
[12:35] <LG_Legacy> I'm a #minecraft veteran :l
[12:35] <TrueWolves> I'd have to go and collect join dates
[12:35] <LG_Legacy> Nearly 90% of people here know me
[12:35] <vede> Indeed, LG.
[12:35] <TrueWolves> Parthon is one I'm sure off
[12:35] <TrueWolves> of*
[12:35] <liq3> yeh he is.
[12:35] <Sa[i]nT> I don't know any of you.
[12:35] <LG_Legacy> 60% of the minecraft community knows me as-well
[12:35] <Malikat> i thought i was a pretty good regular until i disappeared for a week and nobody noticed /wrists
[12:35] <liq3> he was here when we had to grass ffor glass.
[12:35] <TrueWolves> But that's even if this auto-voice thing for 1 year no major problem vets is even a go
[12:35] <LG_Legacy> 98% of the community knows Notch
[12:35] <Sa[i]nT> I feel like the guy wearing a normal hat as a silly hat party.
[12:35] <liq3> 98%?
[12:35] <LG_Legacy> Mhhm
[12:35] <Sa[i]nT> as =at^
[12:35] <liq3> if you mean the IRC community, sure. :P
[12:35] <LG_Legacy> Those noobs that don't read at all.
[12:35] <TrueWolves> I noticed Malikat, someone told me you were just on a sick leave though
[12:35] <Budda> whos notch
[12:36] <Speljohan_Laptop> irc is the only thing that counts
[12:36] <vede> I just remembered Kratospie.
[12:36] <vede> *sigh*
[12:36] <vede> Sad times.
[12:36] <liq3> i bet only maybe 20% of the actual playerbase knows him. xD
[12:36] <TrueWolves> Kratospie
[12:36] <LG_Legacy> Remember the guys who banned notch because they thought he hacked the server/code because his name was yellow?
[12:36] <liq3> ROFL.
[12:36] <LG_Legacy> Yeah there is those guys
[12:36] <TrueWolves> I had a conversation about cheeotos with him
[12:36] <LG_Legacy> True story.
[12:36] <VurtualRuler98> where did kratospie go?
[12:36] <TrueWolves> I was showing off my color mastery
[12:36] <Sa[i]nT> And who is this infamous Notch guy? lol.
[12:36] <liq3> LG_Legacy: but he did hack the server code! ;]
[12:36] <TrueWolves> Becuase colors weren't banned
[12:36] <TrueWolves> Then I pull out my MineCraft banner, cue it not even working on Notch's client and my kick from the channel for spam
[12:36] <vede> Perhaps he went into a dark hole to live out the rest of his miserable days.
[12:37] <TrueWolves> Ahhh
[12:37] * TrueWolves remmebers that
[12:37] <VurtualRuler98> Anyways how many people will my full name creep out today, hm.

[12:37] <VurtualRuler98> nope!
[12:37] <TrueWolves> Vurtual's full name is VurtualRuler98, vede's is vdgmprgrmr
[12:37] <vede> I remember you from the VurtualRuler98 days, vurt.
[12:37] <Malikat> he just really likes windows 98
[12:37] <VurtualRuler98> "Vurtualruler98 days"
[12:37] <vede> I remember the first time you became vurtual, and for some reason you were a total jackass.
[12:37] <VurtualRuler98> like, the ten seconds I didn't use my laptop?
[12:37] <Sa[i]nT> Gahh, windows 98.
[12:38] <vede> Then you went back to VurtualRuler98 for a few days, then went back to vurtual and you were a cool dude.
[12:38] <VurtualRuler98> You're the one millionth person to make the birthyear joke, Sa[i]nT! Congradulations! You win nothing! :D

[13:55] <Cat> im a cat
[13:59] <vurtual> I'm totally a she.
[13:59] <vurtual> Actually I never deny that it's a theoretical possibility of being male.
[13:59] <Budda> everyone on the internet is male by default, until proof is given
[13:59] <vurtual> but either way I'm capible of being incredibly manipulative, psychologically attentive, and awesome.
[14:00] <vurtual> Proof is that I'm on multiple networks, whose communities would have a go at eachother with knives if they saw anyone acting like one in the other, yet I blend in.
[14:00] <vurtual> Perfectly.
[14:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> public InternetUser() { this.sex = Sex.MALE; }
[14:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> and there is no secondary constructor to define sex

[15:07] <Halerdifith> I'm quite a noob at IRC... I saw a chan that I'd like to go, they say its server is ircnet

[15:07] <LG_Legacy> MY PEASANTS.
[15:07] <Halerdifith> Would the address be irc.irc.net?

[15:07] <Halerdifith> :3
[15:07] <LG_Legacy> Ircnet... Never heard of it
[15:08] <LG_Legacy> I'm guessing irc.ircnet.net? I'm not sure
[15:08] <LG_Legacy> Ircnet doesn't sound like a network to me
[15:08] <vede> Halerdifith, what client are you using?
[15:08] <Halerdifith> Colloquy mobile
[15:08] <vede> Well, the server is actually irc.ircnet.com for IRCNet.
[15:09] <vede> And it is a real network.
[15:09] <Halerdifith> Irc.ircnet.net didn't work
[15:09] <Halerdifith> But irc.irc.net did
[15:09] <vede> That's probably a different network.
[15:09] <vede> Because ircnet is irc.ircnet.com
[15:10] <vede> Or one of various others which all are not irc.irc.net

[22:38] <DDRJake> I've got probability and Quantum physics next week
[22:38] <SnowmanHTC> He's fucking with his internet
[22:39] <DDRJake> I can work things out in probability, but there's so many theorems and proofs to learn
[22:39] <blaster> Certainly Quantum physics would be part of a PHYSICS exam
[22:39] <SnowmanHTC> Yay, quantum physics. I love that!
[22:39] <DDRJake> I do a joint-honours degree
[22:39] <DDRJake> I'm finishing my 2nd year in uni right now, I'll be deciding which branch to follow after these exams
