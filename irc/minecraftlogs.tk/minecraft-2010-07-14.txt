[0:34] <Kokopure> I like having retarded engies.

[0:34] <vurtual> and the worst part is
[0:34] <Keiya> It's a great time to be giant man
[0:35] <Kokopure> because it distracts the other team from my awesome engie.

[0:35] <Kokopure> a parade?
[0:35] <Gunmage> Yup.
[0:35] <Keiya> TkTech: No it's not
[0:35] <Kokopure> like a pride parade?
[0:35] <TkTech> 4 engies all with turrets dropped them outside our spawn on dustbowl
[0:35] <Gunmage> Ran around one after the other shouting out random taunts
[0:35] <Keiya> It's very very hetrosexual
[0:36] <Gunmage> We actually got into the enemy intel and partied there.
[0:36] <Kokopure> heterosexual pride parade?

[0:37] <Keiya> one hit?
[0:37] <Gunmage> Made the dalokahs bar have a cooldown too.
[0:37] <Keiya> No fair!
[0:37] <Gunmage> Sniper is a bitch class.
[0:37] <Kokopure> Sniper is annoying to me.
[0:37] <Kokopure> I mean

[0:38] <Gunmage> Engies were ON the bridge
[0:38] <Gunmage> ON it.
[0:38] <Kokopure> Gunmage, I've been on the bride with my engie team before
[0:38] <Kokopure> it's not as glamorous as you'd think.
[0:38] <emperor> engies on bridge = other team sucks
[0:38] <Keiya> Kokopure: A pair of damn near anything can take out a lone engie
[0:38] <Gunmage> Well, when your team is retarded
[0:39] <Gunmage> It sucks
[0:39] <Kokopure> all it takes is one demoman underneath the bridge lobbying up pills at you

[0:39] <redRum2k10> i found a bug in third person mode

[0:40] <Gunmage> Water?
[0:40] <Kokopure> that shield may be overpowered.
[0:40] <Gunmage> Yeah red
[0:40] <Gunmage> I said it earlier
[0:40] <Gunmage> F5 key toggles on rain too.
[0:40] <Gunmage> Thats why it does that.
[0:40] <Keiya> There's a problem with snow.
[0:40] <redRum2k10> lol?
[0:40] <Keiya> If you look at it from a distance
[0:40] <redRum2k10> rain?

[0:41] <bildramer> ...
[0:41] <Drag> 3rd person mode makes everything start having splashy effects
[0:41] <Gunmage> Yeah red
[0:41] <bildramer> so NBT Forge got fixed
[0:41] <Kokopure> what are you staring at distant snow for, you should be running from zombies
[0:41] <Gunmage> Rain isnt supposed to be in the game
[0:41] <bildramer> so did MCEdit
[0:41] <Drag> but I have a question about redstone

[0:41] <leBMD> gah, the only simcity clone I can find for windows in lincity, but that's not portable.
[0:41] <bildramer> no reason for my editor to exist
[0:41] <Drag> I started my world before the redstone update
[0:41] <bildramer> EXCEPT ITS OPEN-SAUCENESS

[0:42] <chimp> then minecarts etc came out
[0:42] <chimp> doh.
[0:42] <Drag> besides, I figure my home base will just be the primitive desert-island area
[0:42] <Gunmage> Will extend into the ice
[0:42] <Drag> and then later, I'll have redstone city
[0:42] <Gunmage> And have a pit that leads you to hell.
[0:42] <Drag> I have a couple of those
[0:43] <Gunmage> (I have like 10 furnaces smelting cobblestone right now for it XD)

[0:43] <Drag> It might be

[0:43] <ClassiestMedic> only for people with epic comps
[0:43] <Drag> I figured it'd just fall back to the indev styled maps
[0:44] <Drag> where it's just a finite island
[0:44] <Gunmage> Because if it is infinite, then the server will have massive amounts of RAM being used if the people scatter
[0:44] <Drag> I personally want my floating islands back :(
[0:44] <Gunmage> I still get some floating islands
[0:44] <Kyle> Hi guys!
[0:44] <Gunmage> They arent big
[0:44] <Drag> That's one of the things I really miss, with the advant of infdev
[0:44] <Gunmage> But I can fix that
[0:44] <Kyle> Why no blog today?
[0:44] <Gunmage> I found a sheep on a floating tile about 50 blocks up in the air

[0:44] <chimp> if someone wonders into a new zone and generates that area of the map
[0:44] <chimp> and is then kicked
[0:45] <chimp> does the server still have to devote resources to handling that area?
[0:45] <chimp> if no one is in it anymore
[0:45] <Gunmage> We dont know
[0:45] <chimp> i see
[0:45] <Gunmage> He might make it so it isn't really seen when someone isnt observing it
[0:45] <ClassiestMedic> Even notch doesn';t know prolly
[0:45] <Gunmage> Which is what infdev does now I think
[0:45] <Drag> I figure it'll be just like how the chunks behave normally
[0:45] <Gunmage> ^
[0:45] <Gunmage> Exactly.
[0:45] <Drag> i.e., if you're not close to them, they're not loaded in memory
[0:45] <Kyle> Hey guys, why no update today?

[0:56] <Akai> and the gravel beyond that
[0:56] <TotempaaltJ> Was there *water*?

[0:57] <Akai> 5 iron and 5 redstone ore total, I think
[0:57] <Kokopure> I would like to see Mineral Dirt :<
[0:57] <Kokopure> that is only found underground and is better for plants
[0:57] <Kokopure> it'd make me less sick of seeing dirt underground.
[0:57] <Akai> koko, it's gravel I'm sick of
[0:57] <Kokopure> also give gravel a better freakin' use, because it looks ugly
[0:57] <Kokopure> yes
[0:58] <Kokopure> someone else said that gravel should make tar. I would support this.
[0:58] <Akai> I found use for gravel though
[0:58] <Kokopure> Akai, what's that?
[0:58] <redRum2k10> ?
[0:58] <Akai> when making an underwater tunnel, it makes it really easy to build the walls
[0:58] <Akai> without drowning yourself
[0:58] <Akai> Especially on a snow map
[0:58] <BarryLikesBnBns> woah i just found that redstone simulator
[0:58] <BarryLikesBnBns> on the mcforums
[0:58] <Akai> Link to sim, barry?
[0:58] <redRum2k10> link?
[0:58] <Firetempest> id like to see some kind of light producing ore, like red ore does when hit but much brighter. then above ground biodomes can happen underground.

[0:59] <Mitagitsu> Around the middle of the video, you will start seeing massive amounts of mobs

[1:00] <Kokopure> so
[1:00] <TerraSleet> zarro: sci-fi
[1:00] <Kokopure> how many of you are planning on setting up a server when MP hits?
[1:00] <Kokopure> I'm considering it :x
[1:00] <vurtual> ZarroTsu
[1:00] <TerraSleet> i've yet to see a decent sci-fi MMO other than SWG and eve online
[1:00] <vurtual> Two things to point out
[1:00] <Azathoth> i'm running a private one for my friend and i
[1:00] <vurtual> that might just ruin your plan a bit
[1:00] <Azathoth> because public servers will suck balls
[1:00] <vurtual> You're making an MMO, the lamest genre.
[1:00] <Kokopure> mine will probably be private-ish
[1:00] <vurtual> You're having a "runescape esque" experience system
[1:00] <TerraSleet> not really
[1:00] <vurtual> the lamest MMO
[1:01] <Kokopure> I'll just set a password and hand it out to people in here or something
[1:01] <TerraSleet> again, not really
[1:01] <vurtual> taking the worst part of it all
[1:01] <vurtual> ever
[1:01] <TerraSleet> you're basing judgements on your opinion
[1:01] <vurtual> Son.
[1:01] <TerraSleet> you're only "pointing out" said opinion
[1:01] <vurtual> The "hurr opinion" trick stopped working in ancient times.
[1:01] <vurtual> It didn't suddenly start working again.
[1:01] <Azathoth> TerraSleet, it's vurtual. just ignore him :P
[1:01] <TerraSleet> good point azathoth
[1:01] <TerraSleet> seems he's not capable of proper argument
[1:02] <vurtual> She.
[1:02] <Azathoth> again: he's vurtual
[1:02] <TotempaaltJ> It.
[1:02] <TotempaaltJ> It's vurtual
[1:02] <vurtual> Oh boy this massively multiplayer online role playing game some guy made on the internet is going to be great man it has a runescape experience system. Even more grinding!
[1:02] <Azathoth> it's a he
[1:02] <Diablodoct0r> JESUS CHRIST
[1:02] <Diablodoct0r> That Russian Singer
[1:02] <Diablodoct0r> Should be killed

[2:12] <vede> I think some people here lurk just so when Notch comes on they can tell everyone they can.
[2:12] <Gunmage> Because he will have to edit both the pig and control code
[2:12] <Gunmage> Omg, rideable spiders would be so badass.
[2:12] <AhrenJB> Right, but adjusted for tax.

[2:14] <emperor> huh?

[2:14] <Kizzycocoa> I asked on here and via PM if you could ask notch a message
[2:14] <Diablodoct0r> He's made a whole lot of money on it,
[2:14] <Diablodoct0r> In fact
[2:14] <vede> Notch said that he made enough money with Minecraft to allow him to work fulltime on another game after Minecraft.
[2:14] <quaxar> Who cares how much money he made
[2:14] <quaxar> he is still working on the game
[2:14] * Varriount is now known as Var-away
[2:14] <Kizzycocoa> can you?
[2:14] <Diablodoct0r> One days' salary for him, is up to 5000 Euros so far
[2:14] <quaxar> wich means he is a great guy compared to other people
[2:14] <Diablodoct0r> On minecraft alone
[2:14] <quaxar> I know programmers who would give up after making that much
[2:14] <Kodaichi> I care how much money he makes.... I don't want him to be poor :(
[2:14] <vede> Which means he probably won't go back to 'working like a normal person'.
[2:14] <Diablodoct0r> Considering he had up to 500 sales per 24 hours
[2:14] <Kodaichi> luckily, he's rich as hell
[2:14] <Diablodoct0r> And the game is getting more and more fans
[2:14] <emperor> no he isnt
[2:15] <Bluelight> Is it only me or is Minecraft extremely laggy now?
[2:15] <Diablodoct0r> So yes, he can get rich on it

[2:15] <quaxar> Eventually sales will stagnate
[2:15] <Kodaichi> he can afford a cocaine addiction with the money he gots off of this
[2:15] <Diablodoct0r> They will, but by that time, he's got a lot of money
[2:15] <quaxar> lol you guys are bad with money then
[2:15] <Diablodoct0r> And probably started a new project
[2:15] <emperor> hes not rich and he cant live forever off his money from minecraft
[2:15] <vede> Apparently after Minecraft he wants to make a "Space Combat/Trading Sim Done Right"
[2:15] <Rooster> Herd Notch was on./
[2:15] <Rooster> Stopped lurking.
[2:15] <Diablodoct0r> emperor: We don't know that yet. 5k euros a day is promising.
[2:15] <emperor> he can potentially make a lot of money with minecraft but it can also stagnate and everyone stop caring about it
[2:15] <Kodaichi> lol rooster, you can leave
[2:15] <Diablodoct0r> Yes, that can happen
[2:15] <Diablodoct0r> I doubt it though
[2:15] <Kodaichi> false alarm
[2:15] <Rooster> Don't be hating
[2:16] <Bluelight> Is it only me or is Minecraft extremely laggy now?
[2:16] <emperor> if he plays his cards right minecraft can make him rich
[2:16] <quaxar> Yah who cares about his finances
[2:16] <quaxar> you guys are gettin creepy
[2:16] <quaxar> yo

[2:16] <quaxar> but I dontl ike talking about people behind their backs ;_;

[2:16] <Diablodoct0r> Let's see..

[2:17] <quaxar> I can visit the dude who makes dwarf fortreess any day
[2:17] <AhrenJB> Somebody asked how much jewgold he'd made, I did a quick guesstimate. Started an apparent shitstorm.
[2:17] <mnjiman> if people didnt want to pay for it they wouldnt, simple as that.
[2:17] <quaxar> I think thats funny

[2:17] <Diablodoct0r> Notch has made 281 320 Euros so far from Minecraft
[2:17] <quaxar> minecraft runs better with my intergrated graphics card
[2:17] <Kodaichi> notch should do TV comercials, eh? or maybe not
[2:17] <quaxar> than it does with my video card
[2:17] <Diablodoct0r> Not including Donations!
[2:17] <Diablodoct0r> But sales only
[2:17] <Kodaichi> whne it's out
[2:18] <Kodaichi> except, I don't want the community to get too huge
[2:18] <Bluelight> I better play some other high end game instead then.. If it's just me..
[2:18] <AhrenJB> I think he should just do a release through steam
[2:18] <quaxar> You can make your saves update to the steam cloud
[2:18] <AhrenJB> pair it with a steam news release and a %50 off sale
[2:18] <Kodaichi> I want at least 0.01% of minecraft's fanbase to have heard of me....
[2:18] <AhrenJB> gets the publicity and a big base at first go
[2:18] <quaxar> and steam overlay works on minecraft perfectly
[2:18] <Bluelight> Does Minecraft make temp files?

[2:19] <Bluelight> Where are they located?
[2:19] <vede> I occasionally feel bad thinking about when Minecraft's sales die and everyone loses interest in the game. Notch is going to Public-Domain the whole game, so when I think about it I'm like, "Aw yeah gonna be so awesome." but I know I'm saying it'll be 'awesome' when everyone stops caring about Minecraft.
[2:19] <Scrippy> That's not derp.

[2:19] <Diablodoct0r> What does a decent worker earn in the year in US?
[2:20] <Scrippy> So I'd rather join a server early on
[2:20] <Diablodoct0r> Say, a guy with a fairly good middle-class job
[2:20] <Kodaichi> 100k is a decent job
[2:20] <Scrippy> I'd even be willing to join a server with some of you IRCers.
[2:20] <Scrippy> *hinthint*

[2:20] <rob`> Kodaichi: depends on where you live; some places you get by just fine on 30k, others you scrape on 100k.
[2:20] <Scrippy> And what are taxes like in his country?
[2:20] <bildramer> 3 minutes
[2:20] <Diablodoct0r> Scrippy: At all
[2:20] <quaxar> Who cares what the taxes are
[2:20] <Diablodoct0r> From the very first purchase
[2:21] <Diablodoct0r> 28132 purchases
[2:21] <quaxar> u guys are creepy yo
[2:21] <Scrippy> When did he start making purchases?
[2:21] <vede> Taxes in Sveedin are pretty heavy.
[2:21] <quaxar> IDK I was the 100th purchaser
[2:21] <Scrippy> Also, tax rate.
[2:21] <vede> Like ~50%
[2:21] <Diablodoct0r> Scripppy: Now that's a good question
[2:21] <Quatroking> Animator, buddy, would you mind checking a thread of me
[2:21] <Scrippy> So Diablo, like half of that.
[2:21] <Diablodoct0r> http://minecraft.net/stats.jsp
[2:21] <Kodaichi> yeah
[2:21] <Diablodoct0r> half?
[2:21] <Diablodoct0r> Why?
[2:21] <Kodaichi> I live in ontario
[2:21] <rob`> the highest tax bracket in sweden is 59.06% apparently
[2:21] <Scrippy> Heavy sweedish taxes.
[2:21] <Quatroking> I'm not sure if its too...
[2:22] <Quatroking> uh
[2:22] <Kodaichi> But I think I'll move to BC at some point so I can be in poverty
[2:22] <Quatroking> too sexy
[2:22] <Scrippy> I'm thinking actual income
[2:22] <Scrippy> Not net revenue
[2:22] <Scrippy> Yay business major!
[2:22] <quaxar> But tax brackets dont mean 50% of that income is taxed
[2:22] <Scrippy> I'm totally going to be a MPS trading tycoon.

[2:22] <bildramer> I downvoted in reddit

[2:24] <quaxar> vurtual comparing a US store with a canadian store
[2:24] <Diablodoct0r> Scripppy: I don't see how taxes will affect purchases of MC
[2:25] <quaxar> on terms of how much snacks are there
[2:25] <Quatroking> probably not because the last time I spoke to rob he was pretty badass and this rob right now is so-so
[2:25] <quaxar> its pretty disgusting to live in the USA
[2:25] <LG_Legacy> Yes it is.
[2:25] <quaxar> an aisle dedicated to icecream in every store?
[2:25] <quaxar> wtf
[2:25] <LG_Legacy> Even though i live in it.
[2:25] <Diablodoct0r> There are no taxes on the internet
[2:25] <Quatroking> brb taking a shit
[2:25] <rob`> I'm badass in a fluffy-bunny kind of way
[2:25] * Quatroking is away: taking a shit
[2:25] <Diablodoct0r> And taxes are not 50%
[2:25] <Diablodoct0r> jesus christ
[2:25] <bildramer> hey, 33% fatties
[2:25] <Kizzycocoa> lol! XD
[2:26] <Scrippy> Taxes in his country.
[2:26] <bildramer> the USA is a really irregular country
[2:26] <quaxar> bildramer, thats 33% morbidly obease
[2:26] <Scrippy> And taxes in Denmark are about that.
[2:26] <Rooster> Did you know Australia actually has a higher percentage of fat people than the U.S.?
[2:26] <quaxar> its like 60% overweight in the USA
[2:26] <Quatroking> rob`, fluffy bunny as in habbo hotel pink bunny room
[2:26] <bildramer> :|
[2:26] <bildramer> ouch
[2:26] <Rooster> blah blah blah U.S. is fat
[2:26] <Leonardo> o_O
[2:26] <Scrippy> Taxes affect all income he makes.
[2:26] <quaxar> yah nasty
[2:26] <quaxar> I get annoyed when statistics are made to make it sound better
[2:26] <quaxar> as its dishonest and I go ;_;
[2:26] <Quatroking> yeah I now really have to take a shit
[2:26] <Scrippy> Because if the average tax rate is 50%, 50% of his money goes to the gov'ment
[2:26] <Scrippy> So 160K
[2:26] * Quatroking is away: to the toilet and further
[2:27] <Rooster> Isn't Sweden socialist?
[2:27] <quaxar> Scrippy 50% of my wages go to bills anyway
[2:27] <quaxar> so sounds like notch has it better
[2:27] <bildramer> Quatroking
[2:27] <rob`> sweden is very socialist
[2:27] <Diablodoct0r> Yeah
[2:27] <bildramer> you take a shit and then go to the toilet?
[2:27] <quaxar> rob dont you mean social
[2:27] <Scrippy> From May 10th, which is when it started officially "in development"
[2:27] <Rooster> NOTCH IS A COMMUNIST
[2:27] <Diablodoct0r> Notch as a job in addition afaik, so he's really getting a lot of money
[2:27] <quaxar> and the USA is anti-social
[2:27] * quaxar laughs
[2:27] <bildramer> lol
[2:27] <Scrippy> Quaxar: That's after tax money going to your bills, not tax money
[2:27] <Diablodoct0r> Taxes don't affect PayPal purchases anyway, afaik
[2:27] <quaxar> They are not socialists, they are just social

[2:28] <quaxar> so no 100 dollar phone bills there

[2:28] <Diablodoct0r> I agree to cake being tasty

[2:31] <Scrippy> Some database somewhere.
[2:31] <Gunmage> Was trying to tunnel my way through this hill for tracks
[2:31] <Diablodoct0r> But he of course, informs the government that he has a private thing going
[2:31] <quaxar> Plus he buys everything on ebay and will be a star on the "hoarders" tv show
[2:31] <bildramer> its*
[2:31] <Gunmage> But instead I found a cave
[2:31] <Gunmage> Must
[2:31] <Diablodoct0r> And he can prove the money source
[2:31] <Gunmage> Explore
[2:31] <Gunmage> Cave
[2:31] <bildramer> um.
[2:31] <quaxar> So notch actually never made that much money
[2:31] <Diablodoct0r> The government then can't know for sure how much he makes
[2:31] <Diablodoct0r> Thus no tax
[2:31] <bildramer> how can you do this if a person doesn't give any information?
[2:31] <Rooster> Notch should move to U.S,
[2:31] <quaxar> "hey guys lets talk about commiting fraud
[2:31] <quaxar> like its legal"
[2:31] <bildramer> he could say he was Bush or something
[2:31] <bildramer> derp
[2:31] <Diablodoct0r> The only way for the government to affect it, is by hacking payPal

[2:32] <bildramer> there are no other consequences
[2:32] <Diablodoct0r> I've never worked online but..
[2:32] <quaxar> And swedens banks dont report to the local government
[2:32] <bildramer> common sense would choose A
[2:32] <quaxar> due to strong privacy laws

[2:32] <LG_Legacy> You gormless tosser.

[2:33] <Scrippy> Also sweden taxes are 50%
[2:33] <Gunmage> Put a torch and sand and FWOOOM
[2:33] <quaxar> is far more money than a single person needs
[2:33] <bildramer> it gives money to the GOVERNMENT
[2:33] <Scrippy> 31% for EVERYONE
[2:33] <quaxar> so who fucking cares
[2:33] <bildramer> it is BAD
[2:33] <bildramer> hurr
[2:33] <Scrippy> And 20% for amounts over 340K.
[2:33] <Scrippy> So 50%.
[2:33] <quaxar> thats a simple tax bracket

[2:34] <quaxar> I live off of not working
[2:34] <TheMilkMan> Hmm I don't think the snowball render distance is far enough???
[2:34] <quaxar> because I own oilfields

[2:35] <Firetempest> snow hovers half blocks still
[2:35] <Gunmage> I need to stop trying all together.
[2:35] <quaxar> who cares, just use stair blocks

[2:35] <CyborgDragon> you know what would be awesome? a zelda with the versatility of oblivion/fallout 3
[2:35] <bildramer> amirite

[2:35] <Gunmage> Funny
[2:35] <quaxar> because I dont throw away any blocks
[2:35] <Gunmage> All + together = altogether.

[3:25] <Scrippy> For maximum HURRR factor
[3:26] <Scrippy> Are there normally no caves under bodies of water or something?
[3:26] <liq3> Soviet: use an adjacent block (not the TNT) to place the plate.

[4:10] <BlueProtoman> Can't you defuse most traps by using a lever or switch?
[4:10] <Scrippy> It's like having it on a timer.
[4:10] <Scrippy> Levers work.
[4:10] <Gunmage> You could blue
[4:10] <Scrippy> Just incorportate it into the timer.
[4:10] <Gunmage> But they might have made it so it kills you
[4:10] <Scrippy> You might need a chain of logic gates to make it work.
[4:10] <Scrippy> But it's possible.
[4:10] <BlueProtoman> So aren't most traps completely useless?
[4:10] <Scrippy> Depends.
[4:10] <Risugami> damn been playing too much Dwarf Fortress. corrupting my minecraft knowledge
[4:10] <BlueProtoman> On what?
[4:10] * PixelEater (brad@c-98-251-9-234.hsd1.ga.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[4:10] <Scrippy> Well, traps in the truest sense of the word, yes.
[4:11] * Joeslop (Joseph@74-133-50-60.dhcp.insightbb.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[4:11] <Gunmage> Also, wont having 2-3 levers wired together make them flip on and off infinitly?
[4:11] <Gunmage> Once you hit one of them?
[4:11] <Scrippy> But things you can do with red sand logic gates are fukken nifty.
[4:11] <BlueProtoman> You'd have to surround the trap in obsidian.
[4:11] <Scrippy> I duno gunmage.

[4:11] <Gunmage> Someone with red powder
[4:11] <Baphomet> closed doors hold back fluids, and open doors don't, is that right?
[4:11] <Scrippy> Like you can make a spinning lava fountain with a pulser.
[4:11] <Gunmage> wire to levers together
[4:11] <BlueProtoman> So you can defuse almost ANY trap with a level?
[4:11] <BlueProtoman> How?
[4:11] <Gunmage> If you know its t here
[4:12] <Gunmage> You place the lever, and then only your lever works
[4:12] <BlueProtoman> Ah.
[4:12] <Gunmage> Instead of the other trigger
[4:12] * Shrub (poop@CPE-121-216-244-75.lnse3.ken.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[4:12] <Scrippy> You know what else you can do?
[4:12] <Scrippy> Tunnel around it.
[4:12] <BlueProtoman> But what if you only EXPECT a trap to be there?
[4:12] <BlueProtoman> Oh, right.
[4:12] <BlueProtoman> There's that.
[4:12] <Baphomet> you can force the other people to follow certain paths using lava
[4:12] * Var-away is now known as Varriount
[4:12] <Gunmage> ^
[4:12] <BlueProtoman> Perhaps.
[4:12] <Scrippy> Lol lava.
[4:12] <Scrippy> Lava is my plaything.
[4:12] <BlueProtoman> But that might be difficult.
[4:13] <BlueProtoman> Especially if your attackers carry around lots of dirt.
[4:13] * Classiest|AFK (Kevjohnson@12.197.57.185) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[4:13] <Scrippy> That wouldn't work at all.
[4:13] <BlueProtoman> Why?
[4:13] <Gunmage> It would.
[4:13] <Scrippy> Nope.
[4:13] <BlueProtoman> You can just place blocks over (but not in) the lava.
[4:13] <Scrippy> Not even a little bit.
[4:13] <Gunmage> You put the dirt on lava
[4:13] <Scrippy> You can place them in the lava.
[4:13] <Baphomet> for example, my tower is floating, and there's laval all over the ground underneath it, and the only tunnel inside comes up from a cliffside with lava on top of it. so unless you know where the tunnel goes or you're willing to excavate a whole mountain behind the lava source, you can't get in
[4:13] <Gunmage> It gets rid of lava.
[4:13] * TheClassiestMedic (Kevjohnson@12.197.57.185) has joined #minecraft
[4:13] <Scrippy> Tunnel under it Baphomet.
[4:14] <BlueProtoman> Crime could be really easy in SMP.
[4:14] <Baphomet> under what, the floating tower? there's lava there. under the tunnel? you don't know where it is.
[4:14] <Gunmage> I would just make little pockets of lava anywhere near my fort
[4:14] <Scrippy> Really, really easy.
[4:14] <Scrippy> I could just bridge the path with blocks.
[4:14] <BlueProtoman> I hope Notch tweaks the balance.
[4:14] <BlueProtoman> Then again, easy crime would be great for my clan...
[4:14] <Scrippy> You just walk until you can see the ledges of the block you're standing on.
[4:14] <Scrippy> Place one.
[4:14] <Scrippy> And repeat.
[4:15] <Gunmage> Thats if they werent ready to pelt you off your walkway with snowballs
[4:15] <Gunmage> Or arrows.
[4:15] <Scrippy> Alternatively make a staricase up to the tower.
[4:15] <Scrippy> Yeah, but how many people are going to be on 24/7 to prevent that sort of thing?
[4:15] <BlueProtoman> Exactly.
[4:15] <Gunmage> True.
[4:15] <Scrippy> Most structures will be unguarded 90% of the time.
[4:15] * Koppis (Koppis@a91-156-235-236.elisa-laajakaista.fi) has joined #minecraft
[4:15] <BlueProtoman> SMP will either be laden with crime, or be really different from infdev.
[4:15] <Scrippy> It'll be really hard to defend your stuff.
[4:15] <Gunmage> Plus anything floating can be just pillared too.
[4:16] <Scrippy> I think that servers will probably only let select people in.
[4:16] <Iguana> Someone give me a picture of snow blocks and snowballs
[4:16] <Scrippy> Which makes them limited in size.
[4:16] <Gunmage> Well then
[4:16] <Scrippy> And kind of kills the dynamic.
[4:16] <Gunmage> Dont build easily destroyable forts
[4:16] <BlueProtoman> Yeah.
[4:16] <Risugami> i'm 100% sure there will be lava griefers
[4:16] <Gunmage> Wander around aimlessly
[4:16] <Scrippy> All forts are easily destroyable.
[4:16] <BlueProtoman> How do I get a snow level?
[4:16] <Gunmage> Ok
[4:16] <Scrippy> Unless you have a chest full of obsidian.
[4:16] <Scrippy> And even then, it's questionable.
[4:16] <Gunmage> Dont make forts that take a short amount of time to destroy
[4:17] <Dys|Fallout3> Uhm guys
[4:17] <Dys|Fallout3> what is this
[4:17] <Dys|Fallout3> http://nickisawesome.minecraft.net/servers.jsp
[4:17] <Scrippy> Keep generating levels blue.
[4:17] <BlueProtoman> I bet people will build a lot of forts underground.
[4:17] <BlueProtoman> Perhaps almost NOTHING will be above ground.
[4:17] <BlueProtoman> Because it'd be easier to hide things.
[4:17] <Dys|Fallout3> Guys
[4:17] <Gunmage> lol
[4:17] <Dys|Fallout3> I found a fake minecraft site

[4:20] <Diablodoct0r> :)
[4:21] <Baphomet> usually if you go as deep as you can in a cave and you haven't found any diamond yet, you can just pick a direction and start tunneling and you'll hit more cave
[4:21] <Baphomet> in my experience, andyway
[4:21] <Baphomet> anyway*
[4:21] <BlueProtoman> What are the odds of a snow level?
[4:22] <Koppis> Just keep doing it.
[4:22] <Baphomet> that is how I found my diamonds

[4:22] <Scrippy> I just had a pig fall down a mineshaft in front of me
[4:22] <BlueProtoman> According to Ian Fleming and Shirley Bassey, diamonds are forever.
[4:22] <Scrippy> Scared the balls off me.
[4:22] <Scrippy> Also it's like 1/4 I think.
[4:23] <Baphomet> I made a diamond block
[4:23] <BlueProtoman> You lucky bastard.
[4:23] <Baphomet> it's the prettiest block.
[4:23] <Koppis> Btw, do pigs breed in any way? or do they just spawn randomly
[4:23] <BlueProtoman> Diamonds are forever.
[4:23] <BlueProtoman> They just spawn.
[4:23] <Baphomet> I am hesitant to place it though, because I don't know if I can mine it back
[4:23] <BlueProtoman> Just use iron.
[4:24] <BlueProtoman> Iron pickaxes can mine diamond.
[4:24] <Koppis> Is notch going to change it someday so we could make farms?
[4:24] * BarryLikesBnBns (davelister@92.1.56.116) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[4:24] <Baphomet> and what do you get? one diamond, or the whole block back, or nine diamonds?
[4:24] <BlueProtoman> It stands to reason that if iron is the second-hardest substance, it could mine diamond.
[4:24] <BlueProtoman> You get all nine diamonds back.
[4:24] <Baphomet> okay
[4:24] <BlueProtoman> According to the wiki, blocks of iron, gold, and diamond can be crafted back into nine bars/diamonds.
[4:24] <Baphomet> I should test it with an iron block first, it probably works the same way
[4:24] <BlueProtoman> Yes, it does.
[4:24] <BlueProtoman> You're safe.
[4:24] <Baphomet> yes, that's if you're holding the whole block though
[4:24] <BlueProtoman> I guarantee it.
[4:25] <Baphomet> I mean if I place a solid diamond block, then mine it back
[4:25] <BlueProtoman> Diamond works the same way.

[4:25] <BlueProtoman> If you create a diamond blocks with nine diamonds, then mine it (WITH IRON) and try to turn it back to nine diamonds

[4:26] <BlueProtoman> End of discussion.
[4:26] <CyanRyan> >create diamond block
[4:26] <CyanRyan> >mine with stone
[4:26] <CyanRyan> >fuck
[4:26] <BlueProtoman> Don't use stone for diamond or gold.
[4:26] <BlueProtoman> Carry around an iron pickaxe with you JUST for gold and diamond.
[4:27] <CyanRyan> more like
[4:27] <CyanRyan> carry five diamond pickaxes around
[4:27] <CyanRyan> because you can
[4:27] <Baphomet> okay so I placed the iron block and mined it and got back an iron block, not nine bars of iron
[4:27] <Baphomet> but that's fine because I can craft it back anyway
[4:27] <BlueProtoman> You need to craft it back.
[4:27] <Baphomet> right.
[4:27] <BlueProtoman> I should have mentioned that.

[4:39] <Shrub> it'd be cool if trees grew in tight spaces
[4:39] <AhrenJB> No
[4:39] <AhrenJB> tree-dirt-dirt-dirt-dirt-tree
[4:39] <Shrub> tree-dirt*6-tree
[4:39] <BlueProtoman> Is LG still here?
[4:39] <Diablodoct0r> Baphomet: You can grow trees right next to eachother, as long as the tree itself has enough space
[4:39] <Diablodoct0r> But here goes:
[4:39] * BlueProtoman (Mibbit@ool-182d4e17.dyn.optonline.net) has left #minecraft
[4:39] <Baphomet> oh wait, I just ran into a tree-dirt-dirt-tree
[4:40] <Diablodoct0r> Sappling Dirt Dirt Sappling Dirt Dirt Sappling
[4:40] <Baphomet> that's 2 squares!
[4:40] <Diablodoct0r> Basically
[4:40] <Diablodoct0r> Yes but dude
[4:40] <Diablodoct0r> It goes the other way too
[4:40] <Diablodoct0r> Dirt Dirt Sappling Dirt Dirt
[4:40] <Baphomet> I don't follow...?
[4:40] <Diablodoct0r> erm
[4:40] <Shadaez> dirt dirt sapling is the pattern, just repeat
[4:40] <Azrooh> trees need a minimum of a 2x2 space to grow
[4:41] <Diablodoct0r> in addition to its center
[4:41] <Diablodoct0r> So it's 5x5
[4:41] <Diablodoct0r> in total
[4:41] <Baphomet> it's looking like each tree needs a 3x3 space total, with the trunk at the center
[4:41] <liq3> and 7 or 8 high.
[4:41] <Diablodoct0r> argh
[4:41] * Akai (Explorer@c-71-206-139-220.hsd1.va.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[4:41] <Diablodoct0r> Baphomet, I'll show you in a pic
[4:41] <Diablodoct0r> okay?
[4:41] <Akai> Lava melts nearby snow! :D
[4:41] <Baphomet> so each tree has one space of dirt around it not used by another three's one-square radius
[4:41] <Scrippy> Minimum of 5x5 kids.
[4:42] <Scrippy> Well, 5x5x7

[4:42] <Scrippy> If you're doing them inside like I am.
[4:42] <Azrooh> I don't use torches, so I can't really do 'em inside lol
[4:42] <Scrippy> Lava lamps!
[4:42] <Azrooh> I use wood and light it on fire o.O
[4:42] <Scrippy> Hardcore.
[4:42] <Azrooh> I feel that torches are just too damn cheap, I'll use them when notch makes them finite
[4:43] <Baphomet> yeah I made lava lamps in my tunnels too
[4:43] <Scrippy> I use lava lamps as power
[4:43] <Scrippy> since torches will be meh.
[4:43] <Firetempest> i used to do the light wood on fire thing, but only when torches made the game crash for awhile
[4:43] * Flot (Mibbit@adsl-80-164-62.mcn.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[4:43] <Baphomet> well more like uh... lava sconces?
[4:43] <Flot> Is water not refreezing for anyone else?
[4:44] <Baphomet> I'll dig a hole in the wall, cover it with glass, and put lava in the deepest part
[4:44] <Scrippy> It won't refreeze if it's moving.
[4:44] <Firetempest> is the water under a cliff overhang?
[4:44] <Flot> It's a lake.
[4:44] <Flot> And it's in the open.
[4:44] <Scrippy> Is there fire near it?
[4:44] * Darkfire002 (kingdomofl@123.200.214.41) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[4:44] <Firetempest> torch near it?
[4:44] <Flot> No...
[4:44] <Scrippy> I do most of my mining downwards.
[4:44] <Firetempest> lava under it?
[4:44] <Scrippy> So I make one long shaft
[4:44] <Flot> ...
[4:44] * Darkfire002 (kingdomofl@123.200.214.41) has joined #minecraft

[4:45] <AhrenJB> http://img822.imageshack.us/i/omgtrees.png/
[4:45] <AhrenJB> green = grass
[4:45] <AhrenJB> brown is where you plant a sprout.
[4:45] <AhrenJB> that's how to maximize space.
[4:45] <Firetempest> should grid that
[4:45] <Azrooh> i usually use a dirt block to elevate the trees so I can make the grid beforehand
[4:45] <Baphomet> see, I'm seeing that's not even necessary
[4:45] <Kodaichi> wow guys
[4:45] <Baphomet> I can't tell how much grass is between them, but it looks like at least three
[4:46] <AhrenJB> 4
[4:46] <Kodaichi> my left 4 dead 2 files are over 900 million percent corrupted
[4:46] <Baphomet> I'm seeing examples of two
[4:46] <AhrenJB> 4 grass between them.
[4:46] <Baphomet> right
[4:46] <Azrooh> it's telling you to get killing floor, kodaichi
[4:46] <Kodaichi> lawl
[4:46] <Baphomet> I'm seeing examples of two grass between them
[4:46] <Koppis> Kodaichi wtf?
[4:46] <AhrenJB> That wont work
[4:46] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[4:46] <Baphomet> are you sure?
[4:46] <AhrenJB> Two grass between will result in some growing, some not
[4:46] <Baphomet> let me get a screenshot
[4:47] <AhrenJB> 4 grass between they will all grow, and canopies will all be touching.
[4:47] <liq3> ^
[4:47] <Koppis> I did three grass in between, and it resulted in some not growing.
[4:47] <liq3> you can build 'perfect' forests that awy.
[4:47] <Baphomet> oh, what determines which grow and which don't? is it random?
[4:47] <Firetempest> i want realistic trees again
[4:47] <liq3> Baphomet: probably something like random.
[4:48] <SireTRM> Random, depending when they grow.
[4:48] <Scrippy> Me too fire.
[4:48] <AhrenJB> Just use 4 grass between and everything will work out ooook
[4:48] <SireTRM> Those old trees were awesome.
[4:48] <SireTRM> Great for forest fires.
[4:48] <Baphomet> but not maximized wood potential? I'm making an enclosed floating forest and I want to maximize space
[4:48] <SireTRM> And living in.
[4:49] <AhrenJB> 4 grass between IS maximized wood potential.
[4:49] <SireTRM> Baphomet, if you want a complete forest, 4 blocks between saplings.
[4:50] <Baphomet> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v54/generaleggplant/PObannersmall.jpg so this is the exception and not the norm?
[4:50] <Baphomet> wait
[4:50] <Baphomet> wrong image
[4:50] <Baphomet> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v54/generaleggplant/treeeees.png
[4:50] <Baphomet> my bad
[4:50] <AhrenJB> Whatever happened there, is wrong.
[4:51] <Flot> Yeah... I think this may be a bug. This water hasn't turned back into ice in over ten minutes, and it's sitting out in the dark snowy night with nothing above it.

[4:54] <Blubex> That's been known for a while.
[4:54] <Blubex> Snow falls on the top of block.
[4:54] <Serow> Muahaha, snowballing the wool off of sheep is my new favorite act.
[4:54] <Firetempest> been like that. rails will also float on half blocks. halfblocks suck in general
[4:54] <Askee> lol
[4:54] <Firetempest> but it lets you make deep snow
[4:54] <Blubex> I loove snowballs
[4:55] <Flot> I hope Notch finds a way to fix all this ugly half block business eventually.

[5:12] <vurtual> Aexis_Rai, not really
[5:12] <Blubex> Milk them
[5:12] <Flot> Notch confirmed that a while back.
[5:12] <Blubex> good.
[5:12] <Flot> Cows and chickens.
[5:12] <vurtual> it'd give it that ahead-of-its-time feel that most good old games had
[5:12] <vurtual> like Goldeneye to an extent, and Deus Ex
[5:12] <Blubex> I hope when I wake up cows will exist.
[5:12] <Flot> And he confirmed in a brocraft stream that there would be monster variants, such as "cobblestone creeper, flaming spider"
[5:13] <vurtual> Remember how soldiers would suffer extreme pain from being shot between the legs?
[5:13] <Blubex> scary
[5:13] <Aexis_Rai> ...cobblestone creeper?
[5:13] <Aexis_Rai> HOLY.
[5:13] <vurtual> obsidian creeper
[5:13] <Aexis_Rai> Rather, UNHOLY.
[5:13] <Aexis_Rai> That's just wrong.
[5:13] <vurtual> brimstone creeper

[5:14] <Iguana> I am terribly confused :/
[5:14] <Diablodoct0r> Okay
[5:14] <Diablodoct0r> I have now uploaded an official demonstration picture
[5:14] <Aexis_Rai> I.E. "brimstone"
[5:14] <Diablodoct0r> That demonstrates what you need

[5:14] <Diablodoct0r> That is, it's 99% done
[5:15] <Aexis_Rai> Iguana: apparently, Notch suggested there would be modified versions of mobs
[5:15] <Iguana> Ohhhh
[5:15] <Iguana> Interesting
[5:15] <Aexis_Rai> cobblestone creeper, flaming spider, etc

[5:15] <Flot> No.
[5:15] <Flot> Several days ago actually.
[5:15] <Aexis_Rai> How recently?
[5:15] <Flot> It's even in the minepedia by now.
[5:16] <Aexis_Rai> Speaking of minepedia
[5:16] <Iguana> The only thing I'd like to see again, are the monsters with armor

[5:16] <Flot> Eww.
[5:16] <Aexis_Rai> How does one extend a power line?
[5:16] <DEElekgolo> placeing lava over snow makes it spawn over it
[5:16] <Aexis_Rai> It's been in the game before, Flot
[5:16] <Aexis_Rai> And frankly it makes sense
[5:16] <Flot> I know.

[5:17] <Flot> Wait, not creative.
[5:17] <Flot> Survival test.
[5:17] <Iguana> Since Notch is so interested in SMP, I'm wondering if we might see a picture or 2 in a few days...
[5:17] <Flot> Well, he successfully got a client to connect, so that implies success. But there wouldn't be much to take a picture of.
[5:17] <Flot> Two guys standing around?
[5:17] <Aexis_Rai> Does anyone know how to extend a Redstone power line over the 15 block limit?

[5:18] <Aexis_Rai> I assumed something similar to that

[5:18] <Flot> Someone really needs to update that block picture on Minepedia. It doesn't have redstone, diamond (in an acceptable picture), ice, snow, or obsidan IIRC.
[5:18] <Firetempest> line torch block line and just continue that ever 15
[5:19] <Axaj> if you end up with the opposite of what you want, add another not gate along the line
[5:19] <Aexis_Rai> Thanks.

[5:38] <quaxar> and nobody will know
[5:38] <Zaratustra> plus: central heating
[5:38] <quaxar> Hide good items in multuplayer
[5:39] <vurtual> or here's an idea
[5:39] <vurtual> under your furnace in your house
[5:39] <vurtual> another furnace
[5:39] <vurtual> hiding items
[5:39] <ZarroTsu> :|
[5:39] <Zaratustra> the furnace in your house!

[5:39] <vurtual> under the parrot is a key

[5:40] <vurtual> use the key on the door under hte minecart
[5:40] <vurtual> and then enter the number on a keypad behind it
[5:40] <quaxar> I forgot are furnaces crepper poofed
[5:40] <vurtual> you will have access to a small bunker
[5:40] <Neoboy80> then do the peter panda dance across a trapped floor
[5:40] <vurtual> then, you can dig below the floor for about fifty feet
[5:40] <vurtual> and a hatch will be open
[5:40] <vurtual> Neoboy80 might have just won here
[5:40] <Neoboy80> then behind the hatch is kthulu
[5:40] <Neoboy80> only he's made of creepers
[5:40] <Neoboy80> and thank you
[5:41] <ZarroTsu> where will people store their treasure while they're building these complexes
[5:41] <Kodaichi> do we know if any blocks are creeper proof?

[5:41] <vurtual> the radio will be tuned to a station

[5:41] <wolf_alex> so who likes todays update?
[5:41] <quaxar> Uh, yeah I was just being all sekritive
[5:42] <vurtual> the first doors you pass, the numbers on them, add those together
[5:42] <ZarroTsu> moreover, if you're making an elaborate trasury trap, I'll likely notice your extended absense, and eventually follow you on stealth mode, observing your actions, and, likely, setting off your traps on you.
[5:42] <vurtual> when you reach an old nightclubby place, an augmented man will open a door slat
[5:42] <vurtual> say the number
[5:42] <vurtual> he will let you in
[5:42] <ZachT> wolf_alex, the fix of placing blocks on snow makes it great
[5:42] <wolf_alex> what was wrong before?
[5:42] <ZachT> they would float in the block above
[5:42] <vurtual> then, you will bribe the DJ
[5:42] <ZachT> as if the snow used an entire block
[5:43] <wolf_alex> oh
[5:43] <vurtual> to let you play korobeinki
[5:43] <ZarroTsu> hilariously I'd love to re-wire someone's door lock to be a different combination, especially if the wrong combination sets off TNT
[5:43] <ZachT> also machine gun snowballs at pigs is fun
[5:43] <wolf_alex> lol
[5:43] <liq3> ZarroTsu: lol...
[5:43] <vurtual> that will activate russian sleeper agents, who will give you a number station's address

[5:43] <vurtual> reach the address, and tune the broadcast to the radio station from earlier
[5:43] <vurtual> this will target a laser, destroying a rock formation in Nevada, drive there.
[5:43] <vurtual> Once you reach the location, there will be a furnace, which survived the blast
[5:43] <ZarroTsu> <Known greifer> OH SHIT, CREEPERS *rushes to house* *pulls lever* *kk-TssSSSSsss...* WHAT THE FU--
[5:44] <vurtual> under that, another furnace, and below that a ladder
[5:44] <vurtual> at the end of a deep dungeon, will be another furnace
[5:44] <vurtual> below that, a furnace holding the item of your choice

[5:46] <vurtual> below the storage furnace will be your bunker
[5:46] <vurtual> the dungeon is loooong
[5:46] <vurtual> and the furnace is concealed as natural stone in the bunker
[5:46] * Visiiri backstabs vurtual
[5:46] <vurtual> but the room to get it is only accessable by a DNA lock and scanner device, so the other route is for people who aren't you
[5:47] <Zaratustra> then you have to beat the spider boss from metroid fusion without getting hit
[5:47] <Annihilator> this route is for people who aren't you
[5:47] <Baphomet> man this is so sweet. I randomly tunneled into a random dungeon with chests fulls gunpowder and iron bars right next to a big gold deposit.
[5:47] <Iguana> Just make sure you survive getting out...
[5:47] <Annihilator> next to it stands a creeper

[5:58] <vurtual> with police sirens on their heads

[6:18] <liq3> you can use coal in the mines to make more torches.
[6:18] <gordenfreechmen> also, flint can make fires
[6:18] <Baphomet> while mining?
[6:18] <liq3> so you don't have to go back to the surface.
[6:18] <Baphomet> why not just go down there with a bunch of torches

[6:23] <FalseFoxes> Well, I did have a set up where it would have stats per say, but you'd never know your stats and they'd grow so slowly and on a curve that it wouldn't really work to "Grind" them per say. Mostly so that way those who are on the server for more then a few days get faster and better at what they do while making the game a bit harder (as well as making mobs stronger the further away from the center of the map you go)
[6:23] <vurtual> although in burst form
[6:23] <vurtual> FalseFoxes
[6:23] <vurtual> those kinds of stats would be bad
[6:23] <vurtual> This is not runescape
[6:23] <vurtual> Let's look at some non stat-specific games that did stats well
[6:23] <FalseFoxes> I wasn't going to run it like Runescape thankyou.
[6:23] <vurtual> Like, say, Deus ex
[6:24] <Titan> holy shit
[6:24] <Titan> i heard it again
[6:24] <Titan> it sounded like a plane..
[6:24] <vurtual> T-Rexes bred with 747s
[6:24] <vurtual> actually, velociraptors
[6:24] <vurtual> they aren't inherently violent
[6:24] <vurtual> sometimes they spawn hungry

[6:25] <gordenfreechmen> 20 blocks
[6:25] <FalseFoxes> I didn't take any insperation from RS at all, I made my own ideas for a system that curved well and fit MineCraft it's self nicely. =D
[6:25] <Koppis> or vertical space
[6:25] <Titan> make it if you go up to one holding pork and runing for a while it tames them
[6:25] <Titan> like a tamable raptor
[6:25] <Titan> or something
[6:25] <Titan> o_O
[6:25] <gordenfreechmen> then ride it
[6:25] <gordenfreechmen> and become a goblin
[6:25] <gordenfreechmen> and siege pre-generated fortresses
[6:25] <gordenfreechmen> hmm, powered by dwarves maybe?

[6:26] <vurtual> or is a really lame person
[6:26] <vurtual> I don't know
[6:26] <Phil> hey, how do I craft with snow?
[6:26] <vurtual> his favorite videogame theme is kraid's theme from metroid
[6:26] <vurtual> find me a better one
[6:26] <Firetempest> http://pix.motivatedphotos.com/2009/2/5/633694419314405510-DrMcNinja.jpg
[6:26] <Titan> you can only craft snow blocks
[6:26] <vurtual> that isn't industrial metal because he doesn't like that
[6:26] <Titan> use a 3x3 crafting bench
[6:26] <Titan> and shove snow balls in each slot
[6:26] <Titan> and you get a snow block
[6:26] <Phil> ok thaqnk you much
[6:26] <Titan> <- is making an igloo :D
[6:27] <gordenfreechmen> snowballs will be known as "fuckyou utilities"
[6:27] <Phil> snow wars will be so fun
[6:27] <gordenfreechmen> autoclicker + snowball stack = GOOD TIMES
[6:27] <Phil> no..
[6:27] <gordenfreechmen> i shot a pig against a wall
[6:27] <Firetempest> building bridge on corner. *snowfall* FUUUUuuuuu
[6:27] <Firetempest> ball*
[6:27] <Phil> and why do they disapear so quickly?
[6:28] <gordenfreechmen> so you dont become a sniper famous for knocking people out of trees 200 blocks away
[6:28] <gordenfreechmen> with snowballs
[6:28] <Phil> oh they push?
[6:28] <Phil> awesome
[6:28] <gordenfreechmen> yep
[6:28] <Phil> it could still be further..

[6:28] <Titan> can they be used to set off creepers
[6:28] <Titan> can someone find out for me?
[6:28] <vurtual> are you going to let someone think the best game theme is some random lame area music?
[6:29] <gordenfreechmen> you can shear sheep with them
[6:29] <vurtual> or are you going to nerd out for once?
[6:29] <Phil> megalomania is near best game music
[6:29] <Phil> but proibably runway from golden eye is best
[6:29] <Phil> or DF music
[6:30] <Firetempest> dragon force?
[6:30] <Phil> ...

[6:32] <Miclee> He feels it down there.
[6:32] <SireTRM> That's a strange sort of bestiality.
[6:32] <vurtual> no seriously
[6:32] <vurtual> a skill system like deus ex would be awesome
[6:33] <SireTRM> No.
[6:33] <Boyofcheese> I dont think MC should have skills
[6:33] <SireTRM> As in no no no no no.
[6:33] <vurtual> compared to other ideas yes
[6:33] <SireTRM> MC is no RPG
[6:33] <Titan> Actually
[6:33] <Titan> I think
[6:33] <Titan> It should be like
[6:33] <Titan> not a skill but
[6:33] <Titan> 'learning'
[6:33] <SireTRM> Well, RPG in a skill sense.
[6:33] <Titan> ahh i heard it again
[6:33] <Titan> but ye
[6:33] <Baphomet> oh man
[6:33] <Firetempest> i don't even see tower shrooms. why don't we have shrooms for natural underground lumber
[6:33] <Titan> it'd be like
[6:34] <sorre> telvanni, fuck yeah
[6:34] <Baphomet> the wiki needs to say what minimum pick is required to mine something
[6:34] <SireTRM> Learning. PEBCAK.
[6:34] <Boyofcheese> yeah we should be able to grow tower caps
[6:34] <Baphomet> I assumed you could just break a furnace and use it
[6:34] <sorre> well, now you know better
[6:34] <sorre> problem solved
[6:34] <Titan> the more you mine, the more your experience goes up and you slowly, slowly by like 0.1% per block you mine you get faster
[6:34] <sorre> we all make retarded mistakes that no one warns us about
[6:34] <sorre> but almost none of us make them twice
[6:35] <gordenfreechmen> what the hell

[6:35] <vurtual> I had another awesome idea guys
[6:35] <vurtual> a UNATCO style base
[6:35] <vurtual> we build an awesome minecraft landmark
[6:35] <Phil> your last ideas werent awesome
[6:35] <Azathoth> savage?
[6:35] <Boyofcheese> unatco?
[6:36] <vurtual> and then just next to it, a huge organization underground

[6:36] <vurtual> Boyofcheese
[6:36] <Azathoth> err didn't mean to put that ?
[6:36] <Firetempest> then MC would look like face ball 2000 with a bunch of floating ???'s

[7:55] <gordenfreechmen> thats either an ambient noise or that was coming from my bro's comp

[7:55] <Neoboy80> Caves have ambiences
[7:55] <Neoboy80> Really
[7:55] <Neoboy80> really
[7:56] <Neoboy80> creepy ambience
[7:56] <Phil> yep
[7:56] <Phil> iu was so scared when i first heard dat
[7:56] <Shrub> Shit that doesn't even happen in caves
[7:56] <Phil> zombies, omfg
[7:56] <gordenfreechmen> no dude
[7:56] <Phil> caves do have wind actually
[7:56] <gordenfreechmen> it wasnt a cave ambience
[7:56] <Shrub> Yeah
[7:56] <Neoboy80> On a side note, I just tried putting pink elephants in a tornado. It didn't work. :(
[7:56] <Shrub> but all the other sounds
[7:56] <Shrub> like Dinosaur Rawrs
[7:56] <gordenfreechmen> it sounded like a typical wind sound
[7:56] <Shrub> metallica vibrations
[7:56] <Shrub> and Angels Screaming
[7:56] <gordenfreechmen> not a pants-shitting one
[7:56] <Phil> tornado?
[7:56] <Serow> Do snow blocks melt?
[7:56] <Phil> pink elephants?
[7:57] <Phil> serow, i dunno but tell me if you find out
[7:57] <gordenfreechmen> alcohol + life i believe
[7:58] <gordenfreechmen> now that we have snow blocks, i actually think having it fall like sand is a bad idea
[7:58] <Shrub> yes
[7:58] <gordenfreechmen> you can make a snow doorway, but you shouldnt expect someone to make a sand one
[7:58] <Serow> I have a snow block with four torches around it, and a torch on it, and it's still there... I don't think they melt.
[7:58] <vurtual> alchohol plus life means a mathematical formula that uses the complexity and sustained-ness of biological processes and motor actions contrasted against cell alchohol resistance and ability to safely absorb alchohol
[7:58] <gordenfreechmen> serow: fuck yes
[7:58] <vurtual> to determine what happens
[7:59] <gordenfreechmen> i dont have to worry about that anymore
[7:59] <Serow> So you can light an igloo, but snow falls through snow blocks.
[7:59] <gordenfreechmen> it does?
[7:59] <Serow> I made an igloo just a moment ago and it's snowing inside.

[9:09] <vurtual> oh
[9:09] <vurtual> vede
[9:09] <LG_Legacy> vurtual Remind me to ban anyone who deciedes to hate furries.
[9:09] <vurtual> none that I can see
[9:09] <vede> vurtual, TrueWolves is a furry.
[9:09] <TW|PassedOut> vurtual, there are...
[9:09] * TW|PassedOut counts...
[9:09] <vurtual> *cough*
[9:09] * ErectWafflez (jbrand@CPE-124-185-201-117.lns6.cha.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[9:09] <TW|PassedOut> around 15 in this channel right now.
[9:09] <LG_Legacy> Theres atleast 4+
[9:09] * TW|PassedOut is a grey area.
[9:09] <LG_Legacy> Oh
[9:09] <vurtual> since I don't notice any apparent furry stuff here, I'm not pushed to hate them
[9:09] <Rooster> Is TrueWolves even here.
[9:10] <TW|PassedOut> I am by some definitions and am not by others.
[9:10] <gordenfreechmen> sounds like a fucking machinegun when you fire arrows rapidly
[9:10] <TW|PassedOut> So grey area.
[9:10] <vurtual> that or everybody is just immature and I am the last sane person left
[9:10] <Kamila> btw, for the switch, it is purely an input?
[9:10] <gordenfreechmen> its awesome
[9:10] <sorre> furry definitely disturbs me
[9:10] <sorre> but i have no quarrel, so long as they keep quiet about it
[9:10] <LG_Legacy> We have our own channel, so most of it goes there.
[9:10] <vurtual> I don't re-wait wat-ally get disturbed by anything nowadays
[9:11] <LG_Legacy> Same vurtual It's all the same.

[9:11] <vurtual> I am probably to blame for lots of dolphin-intimacy fetishists out there now
[9:11] <Titan> there's my ice tower guys
[9:11] <Titan> take a look :D

[9:12] <Phil> nice job
[9:12] <Titan> my tower?
[9:12] * vurtual wonders how many people he has turned to strange fetishes by his random rambling about things nobody should know about
[9:12] <FNugget> duck eversion
[9:13] <vurtual> suddenly, garbly speaker music has pushedm e into an extreme amount of awareness where I am
[9:13] <Askee> The things I know about? Would make your head fucking explode :|
[9:13] <vurtual> now I'm like... on my laptop, typing
[9:13] <gordenfreechmen> Titan: make a herald the homebody skin
[9:13] <vurtual> instead of on #minecraft
[9:13] <vurtual> It's 12AM let's go to bed yay
[9:13] <Titan> o_O
[9:13] <vede> I can't help but think that vurtual thinks he's a bigger deal than he actually is.
[9:13] <Phil> so if its snowing it will neveer stop snowing?
[9:13] <Phil> until biomes
[9:13] <vurtual> vede d-do you even know who I am?
[9:13] <FNugget> vurtual: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XVeLc6joeQ
[9:13] <Rooster> The problem with the internet is everyone thinks there a badass.
[9:13] <vurtual> basically, some guy who is vaguely important in most every IRC channel I go to
[9:13] <vede> Phil, it's eternal Winter in Minecraftland.
[9:13] <vurtual> except like... one
[9:13] <Phil> no the problem is people need to gett their ass kicked a lot more often

[9:14] <vurtual> that one stereotype in a character
[9:14] <vurtual> FNugget no more like tested(yes, tested) procedures on how to mate with dolphins
[9:14] <vurtual> and various mating facts
[9:14] <LG_Legacy> The problem is that sometimes us ops can't see whats going on.
[9:14] <TW|PassedOut> Eh? It's more of an act of naivity.
[9:15] <TW|PassedOut> In reality I spent a good year of my life removing my fears.
[9:15] <FNugget> oh, that site is old
[9:15] <LG_Legacy> And the rest don't do anything about it except flame the user or say something.

[9:15] * Milp10 (Milp@ip-109-85-45-217.web.vodafone.de) has joined #minecraft
[9:15] <vurtual> and then people probably get turned on by this, confusedly, and end up giving blowjobs to dolphins to "end it" since male dolphins fire off with the force of a shotgun
[9:16] <vurtual> but... it feels so good, and they can't go all the way to end it, but want to and so on, and this is a paradox.
[9:16] <TW|PassedOut> vurtual, stop. =/
[9:16] <vurtual> I wonder if I could write a paper on this and become notable in the scientific community.
[9:16] <vurtual> anyways yeah I'm gonna go to bed.

[9:18] <TW|PassedOut> ._.
[9:18] <vede> He's not even in any of his other regular channels.
[9:18] <LG_Legacy> Ever since we kicked him out he went on an emo fest and left >_>

[9:18] <vede> I really miss him.
[9:18] <Titan> ok guys wana see my tower at night?
[9:18] <TW|PassedOut> As do I.
[9:18] <vede> He was a cool dude.
[9:18] <LG_Legacy> He was alright, troublesome but he was alright.
[9:18] <TW|PassedOut> Mail was annoying at times, but definitly one of the better members of this place.
[9:19] <Bodie> Titan: is that some kind of inuendo
[9:19] <Bodie> ?
[9:19] <Titan> LOL
[9:19] <Titan> i'll show yas my tower when it reaches full night
[9:19] <Titan> my ice tower
[9:19] <Titan> :D
[9:20] <Bodie> eww
[9:20] <gordenfreechmen> the snowballs remind me of the doom plasma rifle
[9:20] <Bodie> orly
[9:20] <Bodie> i should try snowballs
[9:20] <sorre> fuuuuuuuck, i love having access to aero snap again
[9:20] <debris> if yers is a ice tower, you should have that looked at

[9:20] <gordenfreechmen> and the mob
[9:21] <LG_Legacy> The aero glass theme for vista/7 that makes you snap because it interferes with every old game/program possible.
[9:21] <LG_Legacy> PIECE OF FUCKING SHIT.
[9:21] <sorre> aero snap, the win7 feature that allows you to maximize a window to half of the screen
[9:21] <sorre> good for file management work
[9:21] <Serow> I haven't had a single problem with the snap features of Windows 7.
[9:21] <debris> heh, my wm has done that since forever
[9:21] <sorre> well
[9:22] <Bodie> haha you're right
[9:22] <Bodie> plasma snowballs
[9:22] <Kamila> have someone suggest a conductive block?
[9:22] <sorre> i had to go without it for a while, because i didn't know how to use it
[9:22] <sorre> because i had multiple monitors
[9:22] <Griskard> Why have minecarts been so nerfed :(
[9:22] <ErectWafflez> how does one make snowballs
[9:22] <Shrub> oh man, I hope in SMP when you fire an arrow into a player that it sticks in them.
[9:22] <Kamila> so that we can hide the wire on 2nd level depth?
[9:22] <Bodie> i use aero :P
[9:22] <Serow> Break snow on the ground, Griskard.
[9:23] <sorre> for multiple monitor setups, you can't drag the window against the shared edge of two monitors and have aero snap work
[9:23] <Griskard> They arent on snow, they are on bricks
[9:23] <Phil> what?! It looks like..!! SHRUB IS EVOLVING!!!
[9:23] <sorre> but the win+arrow hotkey still works

[9:31] <Phil> yes flood gates are a must
[9:31] <Phil> and some kind of very hard to make lava flood gate

[9:48] <Baphomet> one will I guess be a garden, and one is for the entrance
[9:48] <Titan> that's awesome
[9:48] <Baphomet> once I'm done with those things I'll replace the water with lava
[9:48] <Baphomet> but I'd rather not lose all my stuff when I fall off while building
[9:49] <Baphomet> so it's water for now
[9:49] <Baphomet> any ideas for the other two floors?
[9:49] <Baphomet> I was thinking I might just make some kind of wicked looking claw thing holding a glass ball on one of them
[9:49] <gordenfreechmen> mob spawners with water conveyor belts sending them into the lava
[9:50] <Baphomet> but thet's kind of random and pointless, really.

[9:50] <Titan> XD
[9:50] <Titan> nah
[9:50] <Titan> you can only hax them
[9:50] <Kizzycocoa> you could
[9:50] <Titan> into ur inven i think
[9:50] <Titan> oh wait
[9:50] <Titan> you can?
[9:50] <gordenfreechmen> Baphomet: hacks, but its damn well worth it
[9:50] <Baphomet> why would that be worth it?
[9:51] <Kizzycocoa> hey, speaking of mob spawners, anyone know how to hack/change their contents?

[10:00] <Shrub> Like back when it actually had a tiny bit of taste and class
[10:00] <Phil> but 16x16 is kinda cool, just seems really hard
[10:00] <Kizzycocoa> no? ok then
[10:01] <Phil> reskins are for noobs
[10:01] <Phil> as are texture packs
[10:02] <gordenfreechmen> inventory is full of snowballs
[10:02] <gordenfreechmen> too many
[10:02] <Phil> mine toooooooo
[10:03] <Shrub> whoa sweet
[10:03] <vede> Phil, I've been working on a 64x64 game over the past month or so, but I've been losing motivation, so I decided I'd make a super-quick game to try and get back into the groove, and over time, 64x64 starts seeming to be bigger and bigger, so I'm doing the whole "Really small game compared to another really small game." thing this time.
[10:03] <Shrub> I found a sea cave that iced over
[10:03] <gordenfreechmen> gonna unkick some pigs' asses
[10:03] <Phil> vede, sounds cool. I'll type up a synopsis and look into that pastebin thing

[10:28] <mnjiman> do you mean
[10:29] <mnjiman> its randomly generated
[10:29] <mnjiman> and infinite
[10:29] <mnjiman> Just explore
[10:29] <Andrew> Alright.
[10:29] <TheMilkMan> Just gen a new one
[10:29] <mnjiman> and a random environment will be created as you explore
[10:29] <Andrew> So they go on forever?

[10:29] <mnjiman> so yes
[10:29] <TheMilkMan> They go on for about 7times the size of earth...
[10:29] <TheMilkMan> irl earth...
[10:30] <Andrew> Wow.
[10:30] <Andrew> Awesome.
[10:30] <TheMilkMan> or so I've heard
[10:30] <mnjiman> thats about right
[10:30] <mnjiman> there is a viewer on the website
[10:30] <mnjiman> if you die and get lost
[10:30] <Andrew> What about tips for a noob?
[10:30] <mnjiman> you can find the spawn point vs your position
[10:31] <mnjiman> goto the wiki for minecraft
[10:31] <mnjiman> study and learn the craft section
[10:31] <Andrew> Aight.
[10:31] <gordenfreechmen> i still dont understand how cave noises work
[10:31] <Andrew> You can't change your spawn point?
[10:31] <mnjiman> not yet
[10:31] <mnjiman> no
[10:31] <Andrew> So if you die while exploring, you end up far away when you die?
[10:31] <mnjiman> you can yes
[10:32] <Andrew> Dang.
[10:32] <Firetempest> i think cave noises are a bit off. i can be outside in the day time and hear them
[10:32] <TheMilkMan> If you're lost trying to find your way back what I do is make T with torches and then check the map viewr to see which way the T is pointing and then I know which way to head
[10:32] <Andrew> Map viewer?
[10:32] <Drakkar> are you under an overhang Firetempest
[10:32] <TheMilkMan> You can also make a tower with a torch ontop where your base is to see it easily
[10:33] <Firetempest> out in the open, way out in the open, no mountains and barely hills around me

[10:44] <Shrub> lol bildramer

[10:44] <Shrub> lol gorden
[10:44] <TheMilkMan> lol
[10:44] <gordenfreechmen> TheMilkMan: it was a block that duplicated itself below it and around it
[10:44] <gordenfreechmen> aka "You have been disconnected from the server!"
[10:44] <TheMilkMan> oh so it kept duplicating forever? lol
[10:44] <digitalrushdude> theres some coal under some flowing water at the bottom of one of my tunnels, and i was afraid to get it because in the old game, if you disturbed the water then the game realized it should be flooding
[10:44] <TheMilkMan> lol
[10:45] <digitalrushdude> and then would proceed to ruin your shit
[10:45] <gordenfreechmen> i had to cave-in an entire chunk of a cave
[10:45] <Shrub> I want water that constantly goes downward and evens out, so you can drain it and it acts like real water
[10:45] <gordenfreechmen> to prevent it from killing me later on
[10:45] <TheMilkMan> I like the water how it is now lolo
[10:45] <Shrub> yeah...
[10:45] <TheMilkMan> Buckets hold a ton xD

[10:46] <gordenfreechmen> the entrance was under a coast
[10:46] <digitalrushdude> nice
[10:46] <gordenfreechmen> some water got loose but thank god for dynamic water
[10:46] <Shrub> yeah
[10:47] <gordenfreechmen> minecraft is addicting as hell
[10:47] <digitalrushdude> it is
[10:47] <gordenfreechmen> it doesnt help whenever i start to get bored notch releases an update
[10:47] <gordenfreechmen> on the mac i have a save with a monster arena
[10:47] <gordenfreechmen> got bored, when i come back on the pc, "SNOW BLOCKS AND SNOWBALLS"
[10:48] <digitalrushdude> does snow fall
[10:48] <gordenfreechmen> nope
[10:48] <digitalrushdude> cool
[10:48] <gordenfreechmen> it seems like a bad idea once you consider the possibilities
[10:48] <digitalrushdude> elaborate?
[10:49] <gordenfreechmen> snow fortresses
[10:49] <digitalrushdude> i dont see the problem
[10:49] <gordenfreechmen> that is all
[10:49] <gordenfreechmen> doorways, decoration, all kinds of stuff
[10:49] <gordenfreechmen> no multi-layers without using non-snow
[10:50] <gordenfreechmen> is it just me or did notch make cloth darker again
[10:51] <digitalrushdude> i dunno lol
[10:51] <digitalrushdude> also i pegged a creeper with a snowball a few times
[10:51] <digitalrushdude> it still blew up
[10:51] <digitalrushdude> but when i blew it harvested a bunch of snowballs for me
[10:51] <TheMilkMan> I tried to defeat a spider with snowballs
[10:51] <TheMilkMan> but it just kept chasing me....
[10:51] <gordenfreechmen> snowballs dont kill anything
[10:51] <digitalrushdude> snowballs do zero damage
[10:52] <gordenfreechmen> at least, without cliffs
[10:52] <TheMilkMan> Harvesting snowballs is too easy you just pour water down a mountain
[10:52] <digitalrushdude> :v

[11:36] <TrueWolves> The more unique creatures like mother slimes (though they are not /that/ unique they are not common) and creepers the better.
[11:36] <digitalrushdude> then they would be cave bears
[11:36] <digitalrushdude> cave bears live in caves you know
[11:36] <Darkfire002> and desert camels and... something
[11:37] <digitalrushdude> and they prefer to use thier claws as opposed to other weapons

[11:48] <digitalrushdude> although it i were you i would make a copy of my save before i beat level 8
[11:48] <Shrub> why?
[11:49] <digitalrushdude> cuz after that the game is in time attack mode, and you dont get to see some of the delishious interface rapeing
[11:49] <Shrub> :(
[11:49] <digitalrushdude> it gets rid of score and gem count
[11:49] <TrueWolves> ...
[11:49] <TrueWolves> There was never a score
[11:49] <digitalrushdude> i know

[11:50] <Ominus> i loved eating snow when i was little!
[11:50] <Shrub> I think the fact that the game CAN mess with the Score and Start Messages

[11:52] <digitalrushdude> yeah
[11:52] <TrueWolves> It doesn't disapoint, infact, it's just as bad as earthbound... and they had to /remove/ some of the stuff.
[11:52] <digitalrushdude> you know that item that poisons enemys?
[11:52] <TrueWolves> Becuase it was to scary for the developer.
[11:52] <TrueWolves> The viper
[11:52] <digitalrushdude> yeah
[11:52] <digitalrushdude> they forgot to make gyigyas immune to iy
[11:52] <TrueWolves> you use the viper on gigyas and if he's poisoned it fucks big time with his HP
[11:52] <digitalrushdude> *it
[11:52] <digitalrushdude> yeah
[11:53] <digitalrushdude> and if you can outlast him

[11:53] <TrueWolves> Want a rom of "Earthbound 2" Shrub? It was never realised in america but some people made a very good translation of it.
[11:53] <Shrub> Was it released in Aus?
[11:54] <TrueWolves> They even managed to break the 15 character limit to allow for the english language in a way that is quote "Allows for an unlimited amount of characters"
[11:54] <BPzeBanshee> Earthbound 2 in Australia? I doubt it
[11:54] <Shrub> Hmm
[11:54] <TrueWolves> There is no non-japanese version that is offical.
[11:54] <Shrub> I'll find it
[11:54] <BPzeBanshee> I find it impossible to get anything legit from old era in Aus these days
[11:54] <BPzeBanshee> Especially since I dont live in populated place like NSW
[11:54] <digitalrushdude> oh, arent you aus people going to get cut off from the internet or something?
[11:54] <TrueWolves> The rom is very well done, it even opens up with a screen asking for the player to buy the game if they make an offical version to support the real developers.
[11:55] * TrueWolves has the rom if anyone is intrested.
[11:55] <liq3> digitalrushdude: i highly doubt it.

[11:55] <Shrub> or someting
[11:56] <BPzeBanshee> The national broadband network is what you're thinking of
[11:56] <BPzeBanshee> They've already done filtering with I think one or two sites that leak info from the government

[11:58] <Cat> censor on my internet? Never.
[11:58] <BPzeBanshee> I dunno about that
[11:58] <liq3> Gamers for example, will be 100% against it.
[11:58] <BPzeBanshee> Ned Kelly got over 30 000 petitions for him not to be hanged

[12:06] <TrueWolves> "Wow!"
[12:06] <Hyperion> guys
[12:06] <Hyperion> are the snowballs good,
[12:06] <Hyperion> ?
[12:06] <TrueWolves> They are snowballs.
[12:06] <TrueWolves> Define "Good"
[12:06] <Hyperion> funny?
[12:06] <Hyperion> cool??
[12:06] <TrueWolves> They are fun.
[12:07] <Hyperion> ok i am gonna try it then :D
[12:07] <Shrub> Crap
[12:07] <BPzeBanshee> Theoretically
[12:07] <Shrub> I think I'm stuck in this level
[12:07] <BPzeBanshee> You can use snowballs while on a rig saddle to giddy them up
[12:07] <BPzeBanshee> *pig
[12:07] <Arsonide> What's a good practical example of where logic gates would be necessary in a game of multiplayer minecraft as opposed to simple input output gates?

[12:08] <TrueWolves> Put all your stuff in to chests so you don't lose it.

[12:09] <TrueWolves> If it selects a seed that results in a snowy level, what has already been genned won't change, but anything added to the map will be snowy and some snow effects will take place.

[12:10] <Hyperion> so
[12:10] <TrueWolves> You lose all your items in your inventory and the time of day resets, also the new snowy parts of the map won't match up correctly with the older orignal map very well.
[12:11] <Hyperion> i will better wait till notch adds it
[12:11] <BPzeBanshee> Nothing new matches up correctly with older original maps very well. -_-
[12:11] <BPzeBanshee> I still have one map from the very first time I built a base in infdev
[12:11] <Shrub> D:
[12:11] <TrueWolves> BP, I disagree, my current favorite map is the result of a messed up older map being intagrated in to a newer map after it didn't save well.
[12:11] <BPzeBanshee> It still works too
[12:11] <TrueWolves> CAVES, CLIFFS, WATERFALLS, EVERYWHERE!
[12:11] <BPzeBanshee> XD
[12:12] <BPzeBanshee> I explored my old infdev map one time when the new save format happened right
[12:12] <TrueWolves> I even ziped a copy to give to people, it's awesome.

[12:14] <Shrub> passing winter
[12:14] <TrueWolves> No, as in winter.
[12:14] <Hyperion> when fall comes, he should aply falling leaves and orange threes

[12:15] <Hyperion> and at spring... new/nicer flowers?
[12:15] <BPzeBanshee> So I went around to cliffs and climbed them
[12:15] <BPzeBanshee> And found no snow D:
[12:15] <Shrub> winter should kill flowers
[12:15] <Roadcrosser> Notch should have a MC convention
[12:15] <Shrub> yes
[12:15] <Hyperion> and at spring there should be apples at trees

[12:21] <TrueWolves> Also Hyperion, stats will be a server modded thing, the core MPS server will very likely not have changeable stats.

[12:21] <Roadcrosser> I like

[12:42] <petern> that isn't a computer

[14:53] <Roadcosser> So my idea for MC convention: Notch emails/puts on his page 2 .PNGs of access passes each with a different code
[14:53] <Roadcosser> Only for premiums
[14:53] <Theodore> hows multiplayer shaping up then
[14:53] <Roadcosser> the premiums can invite another non premium using the 2nd access pass
[14:54] <Roadcosser> then print it out and bring it on the convention XD
[14:54] <Theodore> where would the convention be held
[14:54] <Roadcosser> If there was a convention
[14:54] <Roadcosser> Sweden prolly
[14:54] <bildramer> uh
[14:54] <bildramer> and anyone can just copy the png
[14:54] <bildramer> -_-
[14:55] <Roadcosser> but I said CODE
[14:55] <bildramer> oh
[14:55] <bildramer> on his page
[14:55] <bildramer> right.
[14:55] <Roadcosser> there are different codes
[14:55] <bildramer> yeah.
[14:55] <Roadcosser> so the pass holders have to be careful on hiding them
[14:55] <Roadcosser> lol
[14:55] <Roadcosser> if whatever scanner detects a 2nd one
[14:55] <bildramer> convention you say?
[14:55] <Roadcosser> beep beep beep
[14:55] <Roadcosser> yes
[14:55] <bildramer> :3
[14:56] <Jaska-> quick question.. when I die how long will the loot stay ?

[14:56] <Jaska-> will it dissapear in time or stay there forever?
[14:57] <vede> Roadcrosser, problem with scanners sounding an alarm if it detects a second card with the same ID is that someone could make a card with any ID they wanted and just show up a little early so they get in and whoever has the card with the ID they used can't enter.
[14:57] <vede> So the illegitimate card-carrier gets in and the legitimate one gets kicked out.
[14:57] <petern> heh
[14:58] <bildramer> oh
[14:58] <bildramer> uh*
[14:58] <Helar> jaska the loot will dissapear in 5 minutes but ONLY if you're near it
[14:58] <bildramer> there would be random IDs
[14:58] <bildramer> like HFI45-DH38D-48FTY is valid, but 12345-ABCDE-FGHIJ is not
[14:59] <bildramer> or 048203590458 is, 348098560 not etc. etc.

[15:02] <Snowman> I'm thinking of removing snow from my notification
[15:02] <Unrealomega> The new blog update obviously confirms we're getting books for the Secret Friday Update.
[15:03] <Visiiri> Unrealomega: Maybe books, biomes for sure
[15:03] <Snowman> Yeah, and the monday post means we're getting deserts, cause they're hot
[15:03] <Snowman> ...
[15:03] <Unrealomega> Well, yeah.
[15:03] <Snowman> STOP SEEING THINGS THAT ARENT THERE
[15:03] <Visiiri> Snowman: ... you're not serious, are you? I sure am
[15:03] <Visiiri> I thought deserts was a good idea
[15:03] <Snowman> He's just feeling philosophical
[15:03] <Unrealomega> Snowman: He's hinting at it.
[15:03] <Visiiri> ...
[15:03] <Unrealomega> Why else would he mention it?
[15:03] <Snowman> Like I was feeling yesterday
[15:03] <Snowman> Cause it's his blog? He posts what's on his mind?
[15:04] <TotempaaltJ> Hi.

[15:05] <Snowman> Cause Notch fixes bugs, we're obviously getting cockroach enemies
[15:05] <Unrealomega> Snowman: Yep.
[15:05] <Unrealomega> Those are planned enemies.
[15:05] <TotempaaltJ> Why would he talk about Singularity? Was that a hint?
[15:06] <Unrealomega> TotempaaltJ: Yes, and he can update with new features, like deserts, books, and cockroaches.

[15:11] <Snowman> Then how come she's in the blog post?
[15:11] <TotempaaltJ> Complicated.
[15:11] <Unrealomega> He's hinting at working Episode 3 into an update.

[15:13] <TotempaaltJ> The ear-thingy.

[15:13] <Shrub> "and don't yet know what it means to die"
[15:13] <Shrub> That evoked so many feelings in me
[15:13] <Unrealomega> The final unknown.

[15:14] <Unrealomega> Then you're just using HAX.

[15:30] <Shrub> You put too much detail
[15:30] <bildramer> what the hell have vampires to do with a sandbox game
[15:30] <bildramer> based on construction and survival
[15:30] <Titan> It's becoming more than a sandbox game
[15:30] <Titan> or a survival game
[15:31] <Titan> it's becoming a medievalish themed RPG-like adventure game
[15:31] <Titan> in a randomly generated universe
[15:31] <Titan> which is cool

[17:52] <OpalMist> I was going down a tunnel uderground, once, and it started getting like that in an area, so I walled that shit off like Chernobyl
[17:53] <OpalMist> RaidSoft: I'd look around in the comments of the blog updates.
[17:53] <RaidSoft> that's the thing, I haven't really seen anyone else mention this

[17:54] <OpalMist> It's quite possible.

[18:11] <Tukiko> Guys. I think Notch's post today means he gave up on SMP. Just a thought.
[18:12] <Serow> Nah, he's just in a metaphysical sort of mood.

[18:26] <Azrael-> so you can make a secret passage behind it
[18:26] <Shrub> lol yes
[18:27] <Azrael-> this is totally awesome
[18:27] <Azrael-> other awesome bugs include the water physics letting you make infinite water from two buckets

[18:27] <SireTRM> You can snipe with snowballs further than you can see them.
[18:27] <Azrael-> I'm not playing on a snowy map
[18:27] <SireTRM> I have had confirmed hits of 40+m

[18:30] <SireTRM> OpalMist, no, you can just cut off the source. You have to try to produce more water springs

[18:35] <Azrael-> OpalMist: there's a bug in the minecarts that allows you to make tracks that go uphill on their on
[18:35] <Azrael-> there are some videos of it on youtube
[18:35] <OpalMist> I read that was fixed.
[18:35] <Azrael-> :(
[18:35] <Firetempest> im tired of all my bridges going __---????

[20:23] <sorre> aside from all the plugins that currently don't work due to the browser's beta status, it's awesome
[20:23] <bildramer> sure
[20:23] <bildramer> aside from anything that could be considered good in firefox
[20:23] <Quatroking> oh cool
[20:24] <Quatroking> A library in holland made a deal to digitalize 160000 books
[20:24] <Quatroking> and they'll all be available for free
[20:24] <Quatroking> neat
[20:24] <Speljohan_> tbh, firefox was terrible between 2.0 and 3.0
[20:24] <Speljohan_> then i tried 3.5 and it was pretty good
[20:24] <bildramer> :O
[20:24] <Speljohan_> 1.0 was good too
[20:24] <Cial> anything is better than IE
[20:24] <Speljohan_> true
[20:24] <bildramer> are there any English books?
[20:25] <bildramer> Cial, think of netscape...
[20:25] <SireTRM> IE has one use: To get a better browser.
[20:25] <Speljohan_> netscape > ie
[20:25] <Tukiko> SireTRM: Flash drive
[20:25] <Quatroking> I remember trying out Mozilla Browser and I was all like "wtf this is just netscape" and now I'm all like "lol"
[20:25] <Speljohan_> netscape was so awesome
[20:25] <Speljohan_> back in the days
[20:25] <Cial> ok not "anything" but 90% of anything hows that bildramer
[20:25] <bildramer> :|
[20:25] <sorre> regarding plugins
[20:25] <Quatroking> netscape made mozilla which made netscape which made firefox
[20:25] <bildramer> ok sure.
[20:25] <sorre> adblock and noscript still work
[20:25] <SireTRM> sorre, get the compatibility checker addon. Some addons actually work even if they "shouldn't" work with the newest version.
[20:25] <sorre> in the FF4.0 beta
[20:25] <bildramer> Eversion is so fun.
[20:26] <sorre> i'm aware

[20:34] <Tukiko> 9GB is like 1% of any average HDD nowadays.
[20:34] <Tukiko> Average based on the fact that it costs $100
[20:34] <Shisno> ...Thanks, I'm below average.
[20:34] <realg> 900gb

[20:35] <Tukiko> Actually wait no, I have like 1300ish GB in 3 HDD
[20:35] <Tukiko> But anyway
[20:35] <Speljohan_> my secondary is a 1tb external

[20:36] <Koppis> yeah?
[20:36] <Speljohan_> i need at least 10 years

[20:37] * Chris220 is now known as Chris|InGame
[20:37] <Koppis> Also, <100GB drives aren't all that expensive, and I only needed one for my OS
[20:37] <Tukiko> <100GB is probably like $15 max.
[20:37] <Tukiko> I dunno
[20:38] <Quatroking> Ha, you wish, Tukiko
[20:38] <Koppis> I'm talking about <100GB SSD
[20:38] <Tukiko> Oh, SSD
[20:38] <Koppis> max 200?
[20:38] <Quatroking> these days low-capacity drives actually cost more than high-capacity drives
[20:38] <Koppis> No they don't
[20:38] <Quatroking> if you look at price per GB
[20:38] <Koppis> a 1tb SSD would be closer to 10 000
[20:39] <Koppis> Ohh
[20:39] <Koppis> like that
[20:39] <Quatroking> a 80GB drive is easily 50 euro's while I can get a 640 for 60 euros

[20:51] <programax> okay next questino...I made some double iron doors
[20:51] <VIROS> Best way to stripmine?
[20:51] <NoahGibbs> I want trap doors to kill sheep and pigs with.

[20:51] <VIROS> It's soooo irritating
[20:51] <VIROS> >.<
[20:52] <TimBurtSimpson2010> but TNT also requires scarce ingredients
[20:52] <programax> rebuild and replace the step button?

[20:52] <VIROS> Not if your awesome like me
[20:52] <programax> or just...can't do that?

[20:52] <VIROS> It doesn't work, you have to invert the signal
[20:52] <TimBurtSimpson2010> That's what I'm doing now, Nihil, and I'm not finding any iron.

[21:52] <Deages> SPIDERBRO.
[21:52] <Quatroking> spidper
[21:52] <Deages> yeah shit off.
[21:52] <SireTRM> Nihil, check settings.
[21:52] <Diablodoct0r> By the way guys
[21:52] <Deages> SireTRM: difficulties are broken atm
[21:53] <Neoboy80> Spiderbro, spiderbro, does whatever a spider bro does
[21:53] <Diablodoct0r> I got an idea how to make a trap that ONLY affects Sheep and Pigs
[21:53] <Diablodoct0r> I'm making it now
[21:53] <Neoboy80> How's that, diablo?
[21:53] <Quatroking> "Where I live, it is not forbidden to walk around in the night, and I think, it makes no sense, that a policeman telepathically knows about someone wandering around in the night at the other end of the town."
[21:53] <Diablodoct0r> Well..
[21:53] <Quatroking> "This mod disables the policeman that sends teenagers home at night."
[21:53] <Diablodoct0r> Sheep and Pigs can pass below a block
[21:53] <Quatroking> yay
[21:53] * kaan (Mibbit@88.241.95.223) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[21:53] <Diablodoct0r> If it's only one block below them
[21:53] <Diablodoct0r> So I'm making a huge pit, with 1 block above every part of the hole
[21:53] * Favlaud (Favlaud@76-191-208-104.dsl.dynamic.sonic.net) has joined #minecraft
[21:53] <Diablodoct0r> So pigs and sheep can get below them and fall down, while creepers and others can't
[21:54] <Diablodoct0r> :)
[21:54] <SireTRM> Are you sure that works on sheep?
[21:54] * leBMD (Batmanifes@174-23-0-75.slkc.qwest.net) Quit (Quit: stuff)
[21:55] <Diablodoct0r> Erm
[21:55] <Neoboy80> Wait, so in effect sheeps and pigs are corporeal
[21:55] <Diablodoct0r> It should
[21:55] <Diablodoct0r> Well, I don't want pigs and sheep to go in my watertrap
[21:55] <Diablodoct0r> I don't want lots of wool in my inventory
[21:55] <Diablodoct0r> But guys.. this could affect spiders too I'm afraid
[21:55] <SireTRM> Drowned sheep don't give wool.
[21:55] <Diablodoct0r> They're not tall
[21:55] <Neoboy80> Or non corporeal
[21:55] <Neoboy80> or whatever

[21:55] <Clockwork> what about spiders...
[21:55] <bildramer> it looks like the lighting bugged out outside
[21:55] <SireTRM> Spiders are 2x2x1
[21:55] <bildramer> the trees seem all black
[21:55] <Diablodoct0r> (19:54:53) (Diablodoct0r) But guys.. this could affect spiders too I'm afraid
[21:55] <bildramer> lol
[21:55] <Diablodoct0r> :p
[21:55] <Neoboy80> Oh wait no nevermind I get it
[21:56] <SireTRM> Other mobs are 1x1x2
[21:56] <Neoboy80> Diablo, is it a water trap?
[21:56] <Diablodoct0r> Yes
[21:56] <Clockwork> ive seen this before
[21:56] <Neoboy80> Then the spider will drown and you'll just get spiderwebs too
[21:56] <bildramer> <Quatroking> "Where I live, it is not forbidden to walk around in the night, and I think, it makes no sense, that a policeman telepathically knows about someone wandering around in the night at the other end of the town."

[21:56] <bildramer> called "curfew"
[21:56] <bildramer> what the fuck were they thinking
[21:56] <Quatroking> Yeah, I just installed a mod that removes it
[21:56] <Diablodoct0r> NeoBoy: I think you misunderstand
[21:56] <bildramer> not allowing people to GO OUTSIDE?

[21:56] <Nihil> sorry
[21:56] <bildramer> this is really retarded
[21:56] <Diablodoct0r> Erm,
[21:56] <Nihil> when you said 'check settings'
[21:56] <Diablodoct0r> My trap takes ALL mobs
[21:56] <Diablodoct0r> All mobs that reach it
[21:57] <Diablodoct0r> But ahead of the trap, I'm making a "Road blockade"
[21:57] <Nihil> i thought you meant 'accidentally kick the SATA cable out of the C:\ drive, thus causing a bluescreen'
[21:57] <Diablodoct0r> A pit that only pigs/sheep/spiders fall into
[21:57] <VIROS> o.O
[21:57] <Deages> man I am so glad PETA don't exist in minecraft
[21:57] <Deages> ...yet.
[21:57] <VIROS> Good idea
[21:57] <VIROS> I'll go make a clan
[21:57] <bildramer> rofl Nihil
[21:57] <bildramer> hah
[21:57] <Deages> SHIT OFF, THAT WAS MY IDEA.
[21:57] <VIROS> xD
[21:57] <Neoboy80> Wait, what? How will it only get pig sheep and spiders?
[21:57] <Diablodoct0r> Meaning that I filtrate away most of the sheep and pigs before they reach my trap
[21:57] <Diablodoct0r> I just explained -.-
[21:57] <Diablodoct0r> I'll upload a picture for you
[21:57] <Neoboy80> Thank you
[21:57] <VIROS> Sheep pigs and spiders are only 1 block tall
[21:57] <ZomBuster> a trap ?
[21:58] <bildramer> spiders jump higher than sheep amirite
[21:58] <ZomBuster> gimme
[21:58] <bildramer> hm
[21:58] <bildramer> you could use this
[21:58] <VIROS> Other mobs are only 1 block tall
[21:58] <Nihil> yeah, spiders can pounce
[21:58] <Nihil> HAHAHAHA
[21:58] <bildramer> can they jump over 2 blocks high?
[21:58] <Nihil> this is excellent
[21:58] <Nihil> somehow
[21:58] <Tesla> huh
[21:58] <VIROS> Shit
[21:58] <bildramer> then there's your trap
[21:58] <ZomBuster> i build this giant upside down pyramid to harvest monsters but they don't fall in the pit in the middle :(
[21:58] <VIROS> My castle has mice
[21:58] <bildramer> maybe 1.5 blocks
[21:58] <Nihil> my game managed to save as it bluescreened
[21:58] <VIROS> They're eating my furniture
[21:58] <Tesla> used nbtedit on a save, now opening my inventory crashes the save
[21:58] <Neoboy80> Spiders only pounce when they're near you
[21:58] <Nihil> loaded it up, spider's still here
[21:58] <bildramer> lol Nihil
[21:58] <Nihil> also yeah, turns out the difficulty is set to normal for some reason
[21:58] <Nihil> i never changed it from peaceful :C
[21:59] <bildramer> fail
[21:59] <bildramer> Hard is the real Peaceful.
[21:59] <VIROS> Guys
[21:59] <Nihil> :C i set it to normal, and the spider just disappeared into thin air
[21:59] <VIROS> Does lava put out torches?
[21:59] <Neoboy80> I think notch should change the difficulties to be like the fat princess difficulties
[21:59] <Lutin> Nihil: That's cause there was an update
[21:59] <Neoboy80> "I like it hard"

[22:38] <gordenfreechmen> now im almost dead again, and my a huge chunk of my arena's stairs are gone!
[22:38] <Kokopure> I think Shovels should be able to cut through snowblocks easier.
[22:38] <Kokopure> don't you think?
[22:38] <gordenfreechmen> yeah that'd be nice
[22:38] <Kokopure> shovels should be able to handle snow, I mean...
[22:38] <vurtual> and two monitor support isn't complex enough to let me use it as a musical access
[22:38] <Kokopure> ... it makes sense
[22:38] <Neoboy80> Koko, don't they?
[22:38] <vurtual> gordenfreechmen get an assault rifle
[22:38] <gordenfreechmen> on the bright side, the creeper found iron

[22:39] <gordenfreechmen> on my way to my arena, i came across a zombie and a skeleton in front of my house
[22:39] <Neoboy80> Then you'd need a shovel
[22:39] <Axaj> we'd all die
[22:39] <vurtual> good idea y/n
[22:40] <gordenfreechmen> skeleton shot the zombie, therefore letting me get past

[22:42] <bildramer> :O
[22:42] <vurtual> but it may also never get past research phase

[22:48] <redRum2k10> *spawned
[22:48] <bildramer> yeah yeah sure
[22:48] <vurtual> Infact we'll all probably get shut down because we don't meet with the military "goals"
[22:48] <bildramer> then aliens arrive and shit.
[22:48] <vurtual> and we're not exactly big, or vital.
[22:48] <bildramer> oh well
[22:48] <VIROS> Damn..
[22:48] <vurtual> we don't do fire and forget stuff here, that's pretty much out of the question, and that makes them angry.

[22:50] <Nihil> I made a new map and gathered them just for the purposes of screenshotting
[22:50] <Kokopure> it's definitely very weird how you can't see water or ice through ice
[22:50] <Tesla> oh never mind
[22:50] <bildramer> do you have dummies laying around?
[22:50] <Kokopure> because when you make a very high ice roof
[22:50] <Tesla> its just because its a button
[22:50] <Tesla> lol
[22:50] <Nihil> Tesla: you'll want a lever if you don't want it to switch back
[22:50] <Kokopure> it looks like... there are no oceans
[22:50] <bildramer> wait, wait, backyard you say
[22:50] <bildramer> noice
[22:50] <NMLittle> What is really fun is to tunnel up into ice from below but not crack the ice.

[22:51] <VIROS> Stack banana 'till the morning come!
[22:51] <VIROS> Come mr. tallyman and tally me banana...
[22:51] <Tesla> can anyone recommend some simple mechanism for a redstone newbie to try building

[22:51] <VIROS> He say, come Mr. tallyman and tally me banna
[22:51] <VIROS> >.<
[22:51] <Tesla> i know all the gates
[22:51] <bildramer> lol
[22:51] <Tesla> ok
[22:51] <VIROS> Have fun with redstone
[22:51] <VIROS> It's magnifico
[22:51] <Tesla> im not very technically minded :P
[22:51] <Nihil> I've still not sussed out redstone, I really really need to get round for it
[22:52] <bildramer> actually, just build a Turing machine with a limited tape
[22:52] <Tesla> im trying to figure it out, but i suck at it
[22:52] <bildramer> then again there's the problem of range
[22:52] <Nihil> bildramer: that seems a bit harsh
[22:52] <bildramer> you can't make stuff that extends like 10 chunks
[22:52] <Nihil> a counter should be easy enough
[22:52] <bildramer> because it won't get computed

[22:55] <bildramer> build stairs

[23:05] <realg> you bring the intel yo the enemy base and then
[23:05] <Frenzy> the ?, clockwork?

[23:05] <Clockwork> what?
[23:05] <Frenzy> can we pm?
[23:05] <vurtual> and most of the lower part of the map is flooded
[23:05] <Clockwork> sure
[23:05] <vurtual> so, how should I make the water unsafe?

[23:16] <vurtual> I never have a "one part" in games

[23:16] <vurtual> dark torvus was easy
[23:16] <vurtual> and the phazon mines doubly so

[23:46] <wareya> I made a transistor!
[23:46] <Conundrumer> no way
[23:46] <wareya> It's just
[23:46] <wareya> lol
[23:46] <Conundrumer> 6 bit my bad
[23:46] <vurtual> winner
[23:46] <ShadowScythe2X> wareya wait I thought you were talking about a real transistor in real life ;-;
[23:46] <wareya> That would be an accomplishment?
[23:47] <ShadowScythe2X> now I am sad because everyone else is having fun with redstone and I haven't found any ;~~~~~;
[23:47] <vurtual> so guys
[23:47] <bildramer> hahahahaha
[23:47] <vurtual> think of cells
[23:47] <bildramer> I would just use tables
[23:47] <bildramer> fuck division
[23:47] <vurtual> as organic transistors
[23:47] <vurtual> of the future
[23:47] <Clockwork> ...
[23:47] <Nihil> wareya: isn't a transistor, in digital logic, the same as an and gate?
[23:47] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.11.27) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[23:47] <Clockwork> vurtual: you are wierd
[23:47] <ShadowScythe2X> dividing by two is easy :S
[23:47] <bildramer> if we had a CPU taking instructions, we could easily make an algo
[23:47] <vurtual> a future where our computers have transistors that have basic cell-like intelligence
[23:47] <bildramer> you can work out integer division and modulo
[23:47] <wareya> I'm pretty sure abotu what a transistor is
[23:47] * Rizyq (Mibbit@75.136.222.24) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[23:47] <bildramer> using multiplication, addition and subtraction
[23:48] <vurtual> hardware upgrading itself
[23:48] <wareya> 15:40 < wareya> It's a logic "gate" where one input is a current, and the other input says what direction it goes in
[23:48] <vurtual> like how we comman cells now
[23:48] <Conundrumer> tables?
[23:48] <bildramer> yup
[23:48] <bildramer> check what A and B are, get result
[23:48] <bildramer> lol
[23:48] <Conundrumer> oh wow
[23:48] <Conundrumer> they can get huge
[23:48] <Clockwork> so wait, someone is making an alu
[23:48] <ShadowScythe2X> vurtual: we'd have pretty big spans of time between hardware updates then hmmmm
[23:49] <bildramer> not really
[23:49] <Clockwork> i'll make a register file
[23:49] <bildramer> we should try to use floats
[23:49] <bildramer> lol
[23:49] <Conundrumer> at least with a lot of combinations
[23:49] <wareya> an and is the not of the or of the nots of the inputs
[23:49] <Conundrumer> oh yea we can fit floats in 600*600 space
[23:49] <Clockwork> lol
[23:49] <Clockwork> go for 8 nit floats
[23:49] <Conundrumer> you know what
[23:49] <bildramer> This short article about food can be made longer
[23:49] <Clockwork> or 9 (pos neg)
[23:49] <bildramer> fail paste
[23:49] <Conundrumer> making a CPU is crazy enough of an idea to do in SMP
[23:49] <bildramer> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_precision
[23:50] <Conundrumer> or at least beta creative multiplayer

[23:50] <Clockwork> i dont think there is enough room
[23:50] <Clockwork> wait
[23:50] <vurtual> okay guys here's a challenge for you.
[23:50] <vurtual> a challeeeenge
[23:50] <ShadowScythe2X> I like challenges
[23:50] <Clockwork> are you just making a challenge?
[23:50] <vurtual> find the most complex article on simple wikipedia
[23:50] <Clockwork> ...
[23:50] <Clockwork> alu
[23:50] <vurtual> explained easily
[23:50] <Conundrumer> in b4 physics
[23:50] <Conundrumer> or not
[23:50] * AFK|Mitagitsu is now known as Mitagitsu
[23:50] <Conundrumer> i think i'll continue contemplating redstone circuits
[23:51] <Clockwork> do it, only
[23:51] <Clockwork> wait to do a programable cpu
[23:51] <ShadowScythe2X> I was looking up lambda calculus
[23:51] <ShadowScythe2X> and I was like "gaaaaah this is not simple"
[23:51] <Clockwork> ...
[23:51] <ShadowScythe2X> then I realised "oh this is regular wikipedia"
[23:51] <Clockwork> wait, do you not know calc?
[23:52] * ShadowScythe2X sixteen years old baby
[23:52] <Nihil> lambda calculus has nothing to do with calculus
[23:52] <ShadowScythe2X> calculus is next year :S
[23:52] <vurtual> NOBODY knows calculus
[23:52] <vurtual> ever.
[23:52] <vurtual> Scientists are the people who are using the right made up numbers
[23:52] <Conundrumer> huh?
[23:53] <bildramer> lol
[23:53] <Koppis> When is SMP coming out?
[23:53] <ShadowScythe2X> http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus yeah this still makes no sense
[23:53] <vurtual> koppis

[23:53] <vurtual> but first, you must retake the statue of liberty from terrorists
[23:53] <bildramer> no shit
[23:53] <bildramer> lol
[23:53] <Nihil> ShadowScythe2X: it makes perfect sense to me
[23:54] <Clockwork> ShadowScythe2X: Its easier than algebra

[23:56] * AJ73 (Mibbit@cpe-67-248-5-148.nycap.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[23:56] <Conundrumer> lamba calculus is used for the really sciency part of computer science
[23:56] <bildramer> bored
[23:57] <bildramer> wat do
[23:57] <AJ73> You can't have spaces in any character names in Minecraft right? I'm going to buy it and wanted to make sure
[23:57] <Conundrumer> i wonder who will make the first programmable computer in minecraft
[23:57] <Clockwork> this guy
[23:57] <Clockwork> not
[23:57] <Clockwork> i work full time, i will never beat those that dont
[23:58] <vurtual> Conundrumer
[23:58] <vurtual> redstone will be named after him
[23:58] <vurtual> or her/it/they
[23:58] <bildramer> lol
[23:58] <bildramer> um.
[23:58] <bildramer> it is in fact easy
[23:58] <Conundrumer> i never took a course in digital electronics
[23:58] <Conundrumer> only a simple introductory course in computer science
[23:58] <bildramer> haha courses
[23:58] <bildramer> I never took any
[23:58] <bildramer> lol
[23:58] <Conundrumer> *shrugs*
[23:59] <bildramer> you just have a given bit count
[23:59] <Clockwork> bildramer: HOW IS IT EASY

[23:59] <Conundrumer> easy, as in building a turing machine
[23:59] <Conundrumer> ?
[23:59] <Clockwork> sorry caps
[23:59] <bildramer> let's make an 8-bit CPU
[23:59] <Conundrumer> oh god no
[23:59] <Conundrumer> can we start with the basics
[23:59] <Clockwork> in 300x300c3000 space
[23:59] <Clockwork> with red dust
[23:59] <bildramer> say we have 3 types of operations
[23:59] <Conundrumer> speaking of which, i think i know how to mkae a turing machine
[23:59] <bildramer> store A into memory place B or vice versa
