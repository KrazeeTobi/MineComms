[3:26] <kegs> :D
[3:26] <Soviet> TNT warhead on a bullet, so that i just gonna shoot again and again
[3:26] <Conundrumer> tnt arrows
[3:26] <Soviet> it will make a straight line of hole
[3:26] <Conundrumer> CONFIRMED
[3:27] <kegs> IMO fire arrows > tnt arrows
[3:27] <Helar> Fire arrows!
[3:27] <kegs> -,-
[3:27] <Helar> set fire to pigs at a distance!
[3:27] <Soviet> TNT arrow goddamit
[3:27] <Soviet> shoot arrow and blow up
[3:27] <Helar> gunpowder arrow
[3:27] * Sketchy (Sketchy@cpe-65-27-188-189.cinci.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[3:28] <Soviet> aka explosive shell
[3:28] <kegs> imo ice arrow > fire arrow > tnt arrow
[3:28] <Soviet> I will prefer having TNT arrow for mining
[3:28] <Varriount> Hey, do arrows still catch on fire in infdev?
[3:28] <Conundrumer> ice arrow? useless
[3:28] * tak (tak@cpe-66-68-22-106.austin.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[3:28] <kegs> disagree.
[3:28] <Conundrumer> yes varriont, all entites catch on fire
[3:28] <Varriount> Thanks
[3:28] <kegs> clearly freeze them then set them to fire then blow them up.
[3:28] <Conundrumer> fire/tnt arrows can instantly set off tnt
[3:29] <Hawkzombie> So an honest MC question...when Notch adds stuff like new minerals (the red dust) do you have to start a new world? Or was that only for snow?
[3:29] <Soviet> TNT arrow will more likely to blow up that setting off fire
[3:29] <Conundrumer> you have to explore far enouhg
[3:29] <Drakkar> just for snow
[3:29] <Hawkzombie> ok, thought so
[3:29] <Drakkar> since minecraft generates in sectors
[3:29] <Helar> This game is unrealistic. TNT is not made with gunpowder -.-
[3:29] <Drakkar> you just have to step out of your sector to find the new minerals
[3:29] <Conundrumer> that's thel east of our concerns if we were to seriously consider realism
[3:29] <Drakkar> but snow is determined on world creation
[3:29] <bEjaC> Gunpowder and sand
[3:29] <Drakkar> either it snows or it doesn't
[3:29] <Hawkzombie> Ahhhhh.....no wonder I haven't found anything lmao
[3:30] * Red (Mibbit@stm-ftth-1388.brightohio.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[3:30] <Helar> thats even more unrealisticer
[3:30] <Conundrumer> carrying a castle in your bag, yea totally realistic
[3:30] <Soviet> Helar: realism is not the issue, the fun or the potential is
[3:30] <bEjaC> Exactly
[3:30] <Hawkzombie> heh
[3:30] <Helar> but you can always whine
[3:30] <Conundrumer> and you can get attacked
[3:30] <Hawkzombie> oh, hey, that's what the game needs...LIQUOR!
[3:30] <bEjaC> Dirt can't float in the air Minecraft is wrong

[3:31] <bEjaC> Yes yes yes
[3:32] <Fordlover89> bad with videos
[3:32] <Fordlover89> but
[3:32] <kegs> i think theyre should be a giant methane bubble under some big lakes/oceans that will explode if u dont find out waht to do with it before 6 months
[3:32] <Fordlover89> i've been exploring it for about 2 hours
[3:32] <Conundrumer> so guys, question:
[3:32] * TrueWolves sighs again >.-;
[3:32] <Fordlover89> sigh
[3:32] <Soviet> i hook up 3 levels of 8x8 TNT with wires in the middle of a vertical hole.
[3:32] <Conundrumer> build a turing machine, or make a story/thread about exploring an island
[3:32] <Fordlover89> need hugz?
[3:32] <bEjaC> >methane bubble weighs more than water
[3:32] <Conundrumer> story/log thread
[3:32] <Fordlover89> 6 levels of 4x4

[3:33] <bEjaC> At least it'll be cool
[3:33] <kegs> only one problem.. i dont think minecraft will be done.=/
[3:33] <TrueWolves> You know what I think?
[3:34] <TrueWolves> Who /cares/ if we can't do a thing about it, why worry about it when it may not happen and if it does happen we can't change it anyway.
[3:34] <bEjaC> We'll probably be able to play SMP for a few months
[3:34] <Helar> MC needs mass destruction weapons
[3:34] <TrueWolves> So why make hype about it?
[3:34] <kegs> how would you feel about dieing because of the world farts?
[3:34] <kegs> xD
[3:34] <bEjaC> To keep the public scared
[3:34] <kegs> idc about it i find it funny

[3:35] <Mitagitsu> Guns, no
[3:35] <VurtualRuler98> I have a way to fix this
[3:35] <VurtualRuler98> fans
[3:35] <Helar> notch didnt say anything in his streams D:
[3:35] <Mitagitsu> That would ruin the game
[3:35] <Hawkzombie> I actually want books.
[3:36] <TrueWolves> So here is to hoping for slimes and mother slimes.
[3:36] <kegs> id prefer nuclear weapons.
[3:36] <Fordlover89> i want lightsabes
[3:36] <Fordlover89> sabers
[3:36] <Rooster> He said he didn't know in his stream yesterday.
[3:36] <kegs> i want deathstar.
[3:36] <Helar> nanomites!!
[3:36] <Rooster> I'm think biomes
[3:36] <Soviet> let's see.. you need to cook a uranium ore
[3:36] <Sketchy> make wood ribs, add 3 wood ribs with planks on either side, ka boat
[3:36] <TrueWolves> "<Noun>? The game is ruined forever!" <-- you have no clue how much I hate these statements.
[3:36] <Soviet> and then you need to craft purified ore with 8 TNT
[3:36] <Rooster> also, Pig rape
[3:36] <Rooster> http://localhostr.com/files/de3a0f/pigrape4.gif
[3:36] <Fordlover89> Whatever but i'm going to put on a dress and makeup cause that is what normal men do
[3:36] <bEjaC> SMP? The game is ruined
[3:36] <Soviet> there you have one piece of nuke bomb ready to be triggered
[3:37] <kegs> lol i dont even.
[3:37] <Helar> thats so inappropriate
[3:37] <epaGamer> notch said that the secret update with snow was to be biomes

[3:37] <TrueWolves> I must kill you know becuase he saw the picture. =/
[3:37] <Mitagitsu> Knowing Notch though, I think he might add something else
[3:37] <Fordlover89> AHAHA
[3:37] <kegs> i think it should be a chicken
[3:37] <bEjaC> A new mob or animal would be nice
[3:37] <Sketchy> are snowblocks still 8x8?
[3:37] <Mitagitsu> Possibly another Biomes such as a swamp or volcanic area
[3:38] <Sketchy> err
[3:38] <Sketchy> 3x3
[3:38] <Helar> it should be a female minecrafter.
[3:38] <Helar> [/discussion]
[3:38] <TrueWolves> The next mob will either be chickens or slimes.
[3:38] <Fordlover89> No they are stuck in the block kitchen
[3:38] <VurtualRuler98> or maybe
[3:38] <kegs> [discussion]
[3:38] <VurtualRuler98> the methane will just sweat off normally
[3:38] <kegs> start again
[3:38] <VurtualRuler98> and it'll level out
[3:38] <VurtualRuler98> and MAYBE THEN
[3:38] <VurtualRuler98> there'll no longer be a functional eruption

[3:39] <Fordlover89> unobtionium
[3:39] <bEjaC> Then the sun hurts you
[3:39] <TrueWolves> -.-;
[3:39] <VurtualRuler98> and grass grows slower
[3:39] <Helar> then we'd be vampires
[3:39] <bEjaC> Like Twilight
[3:39] <visiON> ...
[3:39] <Helar> hell no
[3:39] <visiON> ^
[3:39] <TrueWolves> ^
[3:39] <VurtualRuler98> once the grass becomes vacant enough from an area+there's a certain level of sun
[3:39] <Mitagitsu> ^
[3:39] <VurtualRuler98> dirt becomes a deserty sand
[3:39] <visiON> yeah
[3:39] <visiON> :D
[3:39] <VurtualRuler98> eventually
[3:39] <kegs> hmm virtual it wont "sweat off" basicly the drilling causes it to go wack and the sea floor has already raised 30 feet and apperently some parts of water is 1million times more methane then should be creating dead zones also new orleans is 1000x more toxic now.
[3:39] <VurtualRuler98> desertification htis
[3:40] <VurtualRuler98> kegs
[3:40] <VurtualRuler98> and how much methane is there?
[3:40] <VurtualRuler98> Infinity? No?
[3:40] <bEjaC> Yes
[3:40] <TrueWolves> STOP the methane end of the world stuff.
[3:40] <VurtualRuler98> no, there is not infinity methane.
[3:40] <TrueWolves> Now
[3:40] <TrueWolves> =/
[3:40] <Hawkzombie> kegs: you do realize this isn't the first time there was an oil spill this big off the coast of mexico, right?
[3:40] <visiON> Cows burp out most of methane
[3:40] <bEjaC> Back to friday speculation
[3:40] <Helar> kill all cows.
[3:40] <kegs> they said something about the hole being a 20 mile diameter
[3:40] <TrueWolves> last warning.
[3:40] <VurtualRuler98> It's entirely possible, meaning that I don't know how much(it could be less than 50%, or garunteed)
[3:40] <Visiiri> Infinity!
[3:40] <bEjaC> That'd be the coolest minecraft cave ever
[3:40] <Visiiri> What are we talking about?
[3:40] <Visiiri> Methane?
[3:40] <VurtualRuler98> TrueWolves, killing honest discussion is not how you op
[3:40] <kegs> hawkzombie you do realize its not there because of the oil spill?
[3:40] <visiON> It will kill us, like it did 255 million years ago
[3:40] <Helar> i think
[3:41] <Visiiri> This discussion isn't very honest.
[3:41] <VurtualRuler98> 1000x more toxic may be 1000x 0.000001 or something
[3:41] <Visiiri> And, honestly, I don't think that scientific debate is good here.
[3:41] <VurtualRuler98> Visiiri, I get to denounce end of world theories
[3:41] <Visiiri> Oh
[3:41] <kegs> yeah basicly wiped out 95% of life on earth the first time one blew up
[3:41] <Hawkzombie> uh...isn't that what you were saying? This is because of the BP oilspill? :P
[3:41] <bEjaC> Should just toss a match in there
[3:41] <Visiiri> I like the discussion then :D

[4:29] <Tukiko> Only time I see a legit reason for text speak is in texts or twitter for transmitting long ideas into ~150 characters. Sometimes you need to shorten words. IRC is not one of those times.

[4:40] <LuciferZ> Though I'll take them if Notch doesn't want a conductive block.
[4:41] <Soviet> there will be a situation in which you want wire to pass but not anything else
[4:41] <LuciferZ> Whether or not you want a conductive block has no sway on my desires.
[4:41] <Diablodoct0r> Soviet: Build a solid block then
[4:41] * Anon (chatzilla@121-73-166-201.dsl.telstraclear.net) has joined #minecraft
[4:41] <Soviet> a solid block can actually pass power?
[4:41] <TrueWolves> Alright, taking requests to find join dates again.
[4:41] <Shadaez> I think Notch should remove the red torches completely and add a logic block that you can edit to do different things, like conduct, be whatever gate type you want, etc.

[4:41] <Leonardo> Notch and Ez are so cute together when they laugh. :3
[4:41] <Vic> shadaez: no.
[4:41] <Soviet> you need red torch for that
[4:41] <Diablodoct0r> Or, make 2 layers of Sand
[4:41] <Harr> k another

[4:42] <Diablodoct0r> 2 layers
[4:42] <Diablodoct0r> instead of 1
[4:42] <Soviet> it is input, but not output
[4:42] <LuciferZ> That would require another menu though, Shadaez. Last I heard, Notch wants to avoid more menus
[4:42] <Vic> he said that he wants it to stay simple
[4:42] <Shadaez> LuciferZ I'd imagine it being exactly like the crafting table
[4:42] <Anon> Does anyone know why you can only pick up 8 snowballs?
[4:42] <Riv> Oh, that livestream is so cool!
[4:42] <Harr> it was fun
[4:42] <Fordlover89> yeah anon
[4:42] <Soviet> anon, because snowballs are sexy
[4:42] <Fordlover89> i have stacks of 64 made before the update though
[4:42] <Fordlover89> lol
[4:42] <Leonardo> It's cold, so you can hold a limit.
[4:42] <Riv> It's smp awesome
[4:42] <Vic> well shadaez. tell me. what are you gonna use your gates for in actual survival
[4:42] <TrueWolves> Thanks for keeping us updated Harr, sorry again for the kick. x.x;
[4:42] <Vic> opening blocks?
[4:42] <Shadaez> Vicrry_ my idea's much more simple
[4:43] <Vic> *doors
[4:43] <Vic> not blocks
[4:43] <Harr> no worries :)

[4:43] <Vic> making (useless) clocks?
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> Right-click
[4:43] <Leonardo> Why can't Notch use the multiplayer code he has now?
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> Like a furncae
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> or crafting
[4:43] <Leonardo> Stop talking
[4:43] <Leonardo> like
[4:43] <Leonardo> this
[4:43] <Harr> not working in smp leo
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> Leonardo: I could tell you all teh bugs in SMP right now but .. too many
[4:43] <Soviet> leonardo, you do not want broken codes replacing working ones
[4:43] <Vic> there's... not really much that you can wire to an output
[4:43] <LuciferZ> Because, Leonardo, it's totally fucking different.
[4:43] <Leonardo> blah blah.
[4:43] <Leonardo> okay.
[4:43] <Shadaez> Vic I'd probably just make traps and stuff, not sure.
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> xD
[4:43] <LuciferZ> Simple as that.

[4:44] <Leonardo> LuciferZ, you dont need to swear.
[4:44] <Vic> there's tnt traps
[4:44] <Leonardo> you dont need to fucking swear!
[4:44] <Vic> and...thats it
[4:44] <Shadaez> tnt traps are dumb
[4:44] <LuciferZ> But I likes to
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> o.o
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> calm down kids
[4:44] <Leonardo> you dont mean it right?
[4:44] <Harr> but it worked pretty darn good for a first try
[4:44] <Shadaez> trapdoors are where it's at
[4:44] <Leonardo> :D
[4:44] <Sketchy> It's amazing that he's gotten so far ino working mp though
[4:44] <Soviet> shadaez, i just enjoy things blowing up
[4:44] <Shadaez> trapdoors that are only active during the night
[4:44] <LuciferZ> I mean every word I ever say, ever :D
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> No traps are stupid
[4:44] <Leonardo> :(
[4:44] <Leonardo> you're mean.

[4:44] <Leonardo> shut up Diablo.
[4:44] <Shadaez> and then the creature falls into a deep hole and dies
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> xD
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> Yes sir.
[4:44] <Leonardo> :D
[4:44] <LuciferZ> D:
[4:44] <Vic> gates are pretty... useless while ACTUALLY PLAYING survival
[4:45] <Soviet> why do you think i want conductive block? so i can make a 3x3x(whatever depth I want) mines
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> brb
[4:45] <Leonardo> Vic, I thought you said "goats are pretty"

[4:45] <Shadaez> Vic you could make combination locks for doors to prevent stealing
[4:45] <Soviet> if the gates are too strong
[4:45] <Vic> if someone wants to steal your shit
[4:45] <Soviet> i will just drill a hole on the wall

[4:46] <Fordlover89> i only have a 2 block tall wall
[4:46] <Kokopure> is "All is full of love!"

[4:47] <Shadaez> Vic just make a floating place and have lava in the bottom and throughout the sides, if they put a hole in it they burn to death
[4:47] <Vic> mmhm
[4:47] <geraldbrent> mmm
[4:47] <Soviet> to make it even more epic, explosion of one will trigger the whole TNT
[4:47] <Shadaez> then there's a combination locked door
[4:47] <Shadaez> better?
[4:48] <Vic> ...and all that
[4:48] <Vic> to make a trap
[4:48] <Shadaez> plus you could make treasure hunts
[4:48] <Vic> that's easily avoidable?
[4:48] <Soviet> 1 TNT exploded, a wire got triggered,
[4:48] <Soviet> guess what? the rest of the area will explode
[4:48] <Naxza> Do stutter voids still exist?
[4:48] <Vic> if everything explodes
[4:48] <Naxza> Or was that bug fixed?
[4:48] <Vic> you won't have your items anyway

[4:49] <VurtualRuler98> CONTAINED
[4:49] <TrueWolves> hm?
[4:50] <AhrenJB> Just need code-padded doors. Wrong code, the floor beneath you opens up and drops you into lava.
[4:50] <Vic> and what if you actually drill out the wall
[4:50] <Soviet> i guess in infinite multi , one of the job is making an underground fort but not visible from the outside
[4:50] <Vic> and the lava gets INSIDE the base
[4:50] <liq3> TrueWolves: this it? http://www.zachtronicsindustries.com/?p=726
[4:50] <Sketchy> aw furnaces D:
[4:50] <Vic> i guess in infinite multi, one of the jobs is not being so damn antisocial

[4:52] <Fordlover89> a bunker
[4:52] <Soviet> and if someone try to dig from the top
[4:52] <Fordlover89> call it vault 101

[5:19] <Gunmage> But a giant greif magnet
[5:19] <Gunmage> Considering you could put one in someones base and run like hell.

[5:22] <Soviet> in conclusion, not enough
[5:22] <Gunmage> It will be funny to see people shoot tnt at each other using the cannon trick.

[5:42] <SakuyaIzayoi> It makes me feel like I'm playing with friends! /ronery
[5:43] <Nihil> i was considering an external trading program for alpha
[5:43] <Nihil> where you'd designate a large chest as your trading post
[5:43] <Shrub> interesting
[5:43] <Nihil> and you could put up offers, eg. "i'm willing to trade my 1 sand for your 64 diamond"
[5:43] <Shrub> lol
[5:43] <SakuyaIzayoi> Sounds fair to me
[5:43] <Shrub> Yeah, what a bargain

[5:45] <SakuyaIzayoi> I just realised the lady in the stream was talking about dry lips

[5:45] <Shrub> o hai visiON
[5:45] <Nihil> sure, there's no real challenge, but it's just fun
[5:45] <visiON> she was in the tent
[5:45] <visiON> hey shurb
[5:45] <Sokoban90> The person hosting that server can change your stuff
[5:45] <visiON> i actually have a visual of her
[5:45] <Shrub> Did she report you to the police?
[5:45] <visiON> right now
[5:45] <rob`> only the server administrator would be able to edit inventories or maps
[5:45] <visiON> no
[5:45] <rob`> as well they should!
[5:45] <Sokoban90> Exactly
[5:46] <visiON> didnt see my smoke
[5:46] <visiON> hopefully
[5:46] <visiON> :P
[5:46] <visiON> she did see smoke tho i think
[5:46] <Shrub> O.o
[5:46] <Shrub> Paradox?
[5:46] <visiON> omg
[5:46] <SakuyaIzayoi> I'm assuming you don't mean smoking cigarettes

[5:46] <rob`> I wonder what would happen if a server administrator offered to take in gold in exchange for commodities
[5:46] <Nihil> it'd make lan games and stuff tricky, but it'd work well for online multiplayer
[5:46] <Shrub> Is he accessing his Harem?

[6:40] <VurtualRuler98> Where you have to plan the physical route through the building with only occasional radio codes to tell people to advance beyond something/break the plan, armaments, your team, and so on
[6:40] <VurtualRuler98> or a game where you just have lots of little toys
[6:40] <I-merican> Hello.
[6:41] <SakuyaIzayoi> I think there should be a game
[6:41] <SakuyaIzayoi> Where bullets don't hurt you and everybody dies in one shot
[6:41] <SakuyaIzayoi> and
[6:41] <SakuyaIzayoi> you can fly

[6:44] <Cial> i like it
[6:44] <Cial> and i cant work a logic gate to save my life
[6:44] <I-merican> I read about something on the wiki.
[6:44] <I-merican> The thing about being able to make a security door.
[6:44] <I-merican> Basically by having it so that when the current is on it, it's closed.
[6:44] <I-merican> So the only way to make it open is to stop current from reaching it.
[6:45] <I-merican> But I am having problems getting that to work.

[6:46] <tj505050> awew
[6:46] <I-merican> Hmm.
[6:46] <I-merican> Ok.
[6:46] <I-merican> Well, what happens is this:
[6:46] <Cial> i would think it would be
[6:47] <I-merican> I have the door open with the current off.
[6:47] <I-merican> I pull the switch.
[6:47] <I-merican> Nothing happens.
[6:47] <I-merican> I turn the switch off, the door shuts.
[6:47] <I-merican> So.
[6:47] <I-merican> Instead of doing that.
[6:47] <tj505050> man i have to fix my spelling
[6:48] <geraldbrent> u have to have a not gate

[6:48] <VurtualRuler98> by firing it, it presses buttons

[6:56] <VurtualRuler98> Bomb_Spammer they're seperate themes
[6:56] <Bomb_Spammer> Exactly
[6:56] <tj505050> that would be leet

[6:57] <Bomb_Spammer> Sure it was challenging
[6:57] <VurtualRuler98> the first is so drearily easy
[6:57] <VurtualRuler98> that I can't even pay attention properly during bossfights
[6:57] <VurtualRuler98> and I still win
[6:57] <tj505050> why do three people have white names
[6:57] <VurtualRuler98> Oh no they're unhittable, let us examine wall textures.
[6:57] <Bomb_Spammer> But the environments were drab and retetetive, the ammo mechanic fucked up teh game pacing and the dark world made exploraiton a chore
[6:58] <VurtualRuler98> the ammo mechanic wasn't a problem at all
[6:58] <tj505050> hello
[6:58] <Bomb_Spammer> *repetetive
[6:58] <VurtualRuler98> the "problem" is that it was a proper FPS

[6:58] <tj505050> why do people have white names ??
[6:58] <I-merican> I assume you're working on it right now?
[6:58] <VurtualRuler98> the only repetition was jumping from the temple grounds to agon wastes I guess

[6:58] <VurtualRuler98> ...
[6:58] <VurtualRuler98> Bomb_Spammer
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> You do realize there's no random drops, right?
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> Light beam kills result in dark beam ammo
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> and dark beam kills result in light beam ammo
[6:59] <I-merican> You know you got certain kinds of ammo depending on how you kill them, right?
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> Could have fooled me
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> lots of it, too
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> becuase half the shit I kileld never dropped anything
[6:59] <tj505050> hello why do people have white names?
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> so just smash a crate
[6:59] <I-merican> Yeah...
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> with a single shot
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> and grab ammo
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> I'm not even joking
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> then smash another crate with a shot of your ammo
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> I heard about that
[6:59] <I-merican> The crates do have stuff in them too...
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> Halfway through
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> annihilator kills drop both
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> ...it's pretty obvious :|
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> So I went to the light world and killed a ton of stuff with dark ammo
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> That's the whole mechanic of the game
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> used up like 100 ammo
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> Got 12 light ammo
[6:59] <VurtualRuler98> You're lying now.
[6:59] <Bomb_Spammer> I told the person they lied

[7:00] <Bomb_Spammer> Not at the start
[7:00] <VurtualRuler98> what's torvus bog?

[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> Is it?
[7:01] <I-merican> Torvus bog was where you had those fish, right?
[7:01] <Bomb_Spammer> The light suit made teh dark world tolerable but came way too late
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> Or in other words
[7:01] <I-merican> And you picked up the... flying water jet pack or whatever.
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> You really, really sucked
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> died easily
[7:01] <Bomb_Spammer> And quadraxis was silly because you had to scan him like 19 times dear god
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> were blind to obvious mechanics
[7:01] <Bomb_Spammer> I didn't even say I died
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> and whined about the first part of the map being similar to another part?
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> 3 times
[7:01] <Bomb_Spammer> Where are you pulling this from?
[7:01] <Bomb_Spammer> Your ass?

[7:02] <VurtualRuler98> no, all your arguments seem absolutely silly though
[7:02] <VurtualRuler98> It's like that guy who said half-life 2 was all canals
[7:02] <Bomb_Spammer> So you don't agree with them
[7:02] <Shrub> lol James Hetfield
[7:02] <VurtualRuler98> No, as in, I am having a hard time even percieving them in any way within the current reality.
[7:02] <tj505050> well whats with the invatations there really confusing

[7:02] <Vgcatsrulez12> half life 2 is all canals? lol

[7:03] <VurtualRuler98> It's all brown? But... it's... not all brown.
[7:03] <Shrub> Yes.
[7:03] <Bomb_Spammer> And the dark world goes from the start of the game to the very very end and it's so samey it hurts
[7:03] <tj505050> and please can you tell me what the white names mean
[7:03] <I-merican> I'm using a NOT gate.
[7:03] <VurtualRuler98> yeah the dark world is sorta half the planet
[7:03] <I-merican> Doesn't seem to be working.
[7:03] <VurtualRuler98> ...so, yeah, it's gonna be everywhere.
[7:03] <Shrub> Steam is being soooo gay.
[7:03] <vede> tj505050, IF NO ONE ANSWERS IT MEANS THEY DON'T KNOW.
[7:03] <vede> No need to ask every five minutes.
[7:03] <VurtualRuler98> You haven't even whined about the boost guardian yet Bomb_Spammer
[7:03] <Bomb_Spammer> The agon wastes are a brown empty desolate desert, the torvus bog is a green and greyish brown desolate swamp, adn teh sancruary fortress is just grey and desolate
[7:04] <Shrub> what the hell?
[7:04] <Bomb_Spammer> Plus
[7:04] <SakuyaIzayoi> Oh metroid
[7:04] <Bomb_Spammer> Fuck those virus enemies or whatever
[7:04] <Bomb_Spammer> So annoying
[7:04] <vede> VurtualRuler98, I think you're just baffled at the idea that someone doesn't like the same game you do.
[7:04] <VurtualRuler98> They weren't primary colors, yeah.
[7:04] <Bomb_Spammer> But they hardly ruined the game
[7:04] <SakuyaIzayoi> The recent metroid games are okay, but eh
[7:04] <VurtualRuler98> rezbits.
[7:04] <I-merican> I'm kind of confused about the wrestling moves in the new one.
[7:04] <VurtualRuler98> vede, I've seen plenty of people not like games
[7:04] <tj505050> why would you be on minecraft if you dont like it
[7:05] <VurtualRuler98> but some of their arguments literally won't work
[7:05] <VurtualRuler98> it'd be like saying "minecraft is too linear"
[7:05] <SakuyaIzayoi> It's kind of irrelevant, because everybody knows every game is just copying off of Halo
[7:05] <Bomb_Spammer> Whereas metroid one had ancient sumerian type ruins, a space pirate facility in a glacier ice world, an undergorund lava cavern used as a chozo warrior rite of passage, a space station, a giant mine full of phazon, the jungle type talon overworld, etc
[7:05] <Shadaez> metroid prime series is mediocre, like Halo, CoD, and Fallout 3
[7:05] <Bomb_Spammer> *metroid prime one
[7:05] <Vgcatsrulez12> EVERY game is copying off halo?
[7:05] <Vgcatsrulez12> what?
[7:05] <SakuyaIzayoi> Halo was the first video game
[7:05] <Vgcatsrulez12> ...
[7:05] <Bomb_Spammer> Halo invented FPS
[7:05] <Bomb_Spammer> :awe;
[7:05] <VurtualRuler98> yeah man
[7:05] <Vgcatsrulez12> not really
[7:05] <VurtualRuler98> all the metroid games are ripping off halo
[7:05] <Shrub> lol
[7:05] <VurtualRuler98> all of them
[7:05] <Shrub> troll
[7:05] <VurtualRuler98> even that NES one
[7:05] <Bomb_Spammer> It's an old joke
[7:06] <Shadaez> Vgcatsrulez12 what?
[7:06] <VurtualRuler98> When did that come out? 2005?
[7:06] <Bomb_Spammer> Are you taking it seriously?
[7:06] <Diablodoct0r> lol
[7:06] <I-merican> Ah, I stilll have Super Metroid.

[7:06] <Shadaez> Vgcatsrulez12 you didn't say that because of what I said, right?
[7:06] <SakuyaIzayoi> I think if you say something and then tell people it should be a meme, it will automatically never be a meme
[7:07] <Vgcatsrulez12> no
[7:07] <Bomb_Spammer> No boost guardian was easy shit once you figure out breaking the pillars gives you delicious gold energy
[7:07] <Shrub74> Oh man
[7:07] <Shrub74> The middle part of Master of Puppets
[7:07] <vede> VurtualRuler98, really, maybe Bomb_Spammer can like or not like Prime 2 for whatever reasons he likes, no matter whether or not you agree with them.
[7:07] <Snake> Guys, there's a sheep in my moat / pit around my house. What should I do?

[7:07] <Bomb_Spammer> Wear it
[7:07] <I-merican> Obviously it wants to be there.
[7:07] <Vgcatsrulez12> kill it
[7:07] <Snake> I already took his wool.
[7:07] <VurtualRuler98> vede go back to being offended at misinterpeted sentences about your retro games
[7:07] <SakuyaIzayoi> Harvest it regularly
[7:07] <Bomb_Spammer> Sheep spawn literally every 5 feet on my map
[7:07] <Bomb_Spammer> I have SO MUCH WOOL
[7:07] <SakuyaIzayoi> WAIT
[7:07] <SakuyaIzayoi> Sex with it
[7:07] <I-merican> I started using the wool for carpet.
[7:07] <SakuyaIzayoi> Make sex with it
[7:07] <Bomb_Spammer> I have absolutely no need for iron armour
[7:07] <I-merican> Because it's everywhere, man.
[7:07] <Bomb_Spammer> I use it all for arrows
[7:08] <Bomb_Spammer> And then have shootouts with skeleton armies in my enormous mines
[7:08] <Snake> Kill it had the most votes.
[7:08] <vede> VurtualRuler98, how the fuck was that relevant at all?
[7:08] <Bomb_Spammer> Seriously the main cavern has draw distance fuzz when you look at one end
[7:08] <VurtualRuler98> also I am now allowed to hate minecraft for having too many weapons right?
[7:08] <Snake> Away with ye, sheep.
[7:08] <I-merican> That's fun.
[7:08] <VurtualRuler98> and say it ripped off halo 3 forge too
[7:08] <VurtualRuler98> ok that one is a bit too extreme
[7:08] <Shrub74> ffff
[7:08] <Bomb_Spammer> Yeah minecraft totally ripped off forge
[7:08] <Vgcatsrulez12> wait seriously
[7:08] <Bomb_Spammer> Seriously
[7:08] <VurtualRuler98> I just gave myself a headache for thinking about that.
[7:08] <Shrub74> way to rip off forge, Notch
[7:08] <Snake> The sheep died.
[7:08] <Vgcatsrulez12> you think it ripped off forge/

[7:09] <SakuyaIzayoi> Start over
[7:09] <SakuyaIzayoi> With a new conversation
[7:09] <Bomb_Spammer> This is like when I played takes if Symphonia
[7:09] <SakuyaIzayoi> ..about cats.
[7:09] <Bomb_Spammer> Everyone said it was so great
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> I rented it
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> And got a fucked copy or something
[7:10] <Vgcatsrulez12> cats r funneh
[7:10] <Shrub74> S&M = One of the best concerts ever?
[7:10] <I-merican> ..Tales of Symphonia?
[7:10] <VurtualRuler98> You've gone from "chill out visiiri" to sucking up all the rage in the channel and screaming at me like I stole your wallet and sent you on some kind of insane murder trip to make up for you being pushed around.
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> Every enemy regardless of being a boss or anything
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> Gave 1 Xp and 1 Gp
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> I got to sheena trying to rape my shit and gave up and said it was impossible
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> I ran out of apple gels
[7:10] <I-merican> Dude, what?
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> Yeah
[7:10] <I-merican> I found that game far, far easier...
[7:10] <SakuyaIzayoi> I remember Tales of Symphonia
[7:10] <SakuyaIzayoi> It was great
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> That's because you didn't rent a fucked copy
[7:10] <I-merican> I just breezed through it.
[7:10] <SakuyaIzayoi> But mine wasn't broken
[7:10] <Bomb_Spammer> Someone raped the disk or something
[7:11] <vede> VurtualRuler98, or maybe I just think you're being a dick to Bomb_Spammer and I think it's annoying.
[7:11] <Bomb_Spammer> SAKUYA SAN ROOM CREANING STOOOP
[7:11] <I-merican> That's bizarre.
[7:11] <Shrub74> don't blame the disc on your lack of skill
[7:11] <Bomb_Spammer> Had to say it
[7:11] <SakuyaIzayoi> I remember saying we were going to talk about cats
[7:11] <Bomb_Spammer> Because obviously the fire boss awarded me 1 Xp and 1 Gp for beating it at level 2 because I was just so bad
[7:11] <SakuyaIzayoi> Why is there no cat talk
[7:11] <I-merican> Urgh, this NOT gate just isn't doing it.
[7:11] <I-merican> I'm going to have to go over this more.
[7:11] <VurtualRuler98> No, pretty sure it's the "childhood experiences being enacted upon me" thing

[7:38] <Snake> Bearodactyl: I remember countless times where the pick broke and I didn't get anything for it.
[7:38] <I-merican> It worked for me.
[7:38] <Bearodactyl> go test it
[7:38] <Bearodactyl> because you're completely wrong
[7:38] <I-merican> So the pick breaks after the block you're breaking now, correct?
[7:38] <Shrub74> Be thankful that they're picks and not condoms.
[7:39] <Bearodactyl> yeah
[7:39] <VurtualRuler98> how many uses does one have?
[7:39] <VurtualRuler98> Two?
[7:39] <VurtualRuler98> Firs time, it works
[7:39] <Bearodactyl> picks weaken a bit every time you break a block
[7:39] <VurtualRuler98> second time, it breaks when you're done
[7:39] <VurtualRuler98> and that completely removes the effect
[7:39] <VurtualRuler98> ...throw them into magma
[7:39] <Bearodactyl> and when it's on it's last block, it mines the block, you get the resource, and it vanished
[7:39] <VurtualRuler98> no, Bearodactyl :(

[7:56] <Kodaichi> by the way she blushes after she looks down, possibly not
[7:56] * Askee stabs Bearodactyl
[7:56] <Shrub> Kodaichi: who?
[7:56] <I-merican> Kind of a good point.
[7:56] <I-merican> I mean..
[7:57] <Kodaichi> the girl in that vid
[7:57] <Bearodactyl> overreaction I think
[7:57] <I-merican> You're denying them of a regular schedule.
[7:57] <Kodaichi> well, she's in a gym
[7:57] <Bearodactyl> sign of a selfish person. stabbing.

[7:57] <Shrub> you're in a gym
[7:57] <Kodaichi> but you can do anything in a gym
[7:57] <Bearodactyl> exactly the kind of person who would make it so it can only be dark
[7:57] <Bearodactyl> on the other side of the planet
[7:57] <I-merican> Including horse riding, apparently.
[7:57] <Snake> What is this
[7:57] <Snake> I'm on a beach during the day
[7:57] <I-merican> Idolmaster, right?
[7:57] <Snake> And heard a cave noise
[7:57] <Kodaichi> under it
[7:57] <Snake> Dafux
[7:57] <I-merican> Oh.
[7:57] <Kodaichi> dig in the sand, watch an epic cavein
[7:57] <Askee> I was talking about forcing daytime in minecraft :x
[7:58] <Drakkar> oh man
[7:58] <Bearodactyl> *Hears cave noises*
[7:58] <I-merican> That high pitched squealing noise the spiders make is so obnoxious.
[7:58] <Bearodactyl> *goes to options*
[7:58] <Bearodactyl> *Audio: Off*
[7:58] <VurtualRuler98> spiders hiss irl
[7:58] <I-merican> The cave noises are scary.
[7:58] <Drakkar> you guys just gave me the best idea for minecraft server scripting
[7:58] <Kodaichi> yeah
[7:58] <Drakkar> ooooooooooooooohman
[7:58] <I-merican> I'm sitting there IN MY HOUSE
[7:58] <I-merican> and I hear those.
[7:58] <Drakkar> actually its the worst
[7:58] <Drakkar> but
[7:58] <Drakkar> its boss
[7:58] <Kodaichi> cave ambience made me shudder the first time I heard it
[7:58] <I-merican> It is so obnoxious.
[7:58] <Bearodactyl> oh come now
[7:58] <Bearodactyl> is it that great?
[7:58] <Kodaichi> I thought it was symbolizing the coming of night
[7:58] <Drakkar> yes
[7:58] <I-merican> I like them, but it's scary.
[7:58] <Drakkar> cave sounds are fantastic
[7:58] <Snake> I-merican: The high pitched screaming cave noise is actually a giant spider.
[7:58] <Drakkar> oh wait
[7:58] <Drakkar> my idea?
[7:58] <Drakkar> i guess
[7:58] <Drakkar> i dunno
[7:59] <I-merican> I know, snake.
[7:59] <Kodaichi> imo, we should get a similar noise to notify of nightfall
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> raptors and giant spiders are some new mobs
[7:59] <Drakkar> the idea of a server that's daylight tics follow real world tics
[7:59] <Drakkar> would be boss
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> howling Kodaichi
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> like howling
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> but a bit deeper and scarier
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> because you think it might be a wolf
[7:59] <Chadsweb> Haha Raptors
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> or something worse
[7:59] <Shrub> tics
[7:59] <Kodaichi> well, I mean like the cave stuff
[7:59] <I-merican> The cave noises make it sound like a horror serial killer just showed up on screen.
[7:59] <Shrub> ?
[7:59] <Bearodactyl> ....nahh
[7:59] <I-merican> Like right behind me.
[7:59] <Drakkar> ticks
[7:59] <I-merican> Or near me.
[7:59] <Kodaichi> the very sound of Death itself
[7:59] <I-merican> And the audience can see them.
[7:59] <I-merican> but I can't.
[7:59] <Snake> HOLY FUCKING EPIC CAVE IN
[7:59] <Drakkar> clock
[7:59] <Drakkar> tick tock
[7:59] <I-merican> And I don't know they're there.
[7:59] <Drakkar> as in
[7:59] <Chadsweb> I wouldn't mind wandering through a cave and being mauled by a dinosaur, really
[7:59] <Drakkar> it checks the server's time
[7:59] <Drakkar> to determine what the in-game time
[7:59] <I-merican> till they get right up next to me and stab me in the ass.
[7:59] <Drakkar> is
[7:59] <Kodaichi> ringing ominously through your mind as evil starts to appear all around you
[7:59] <Bearodactyl> I only play at night dude
[7:59] <Chadsweb> I mean, as long as I look awesome while I'm being mauled
[8:00] <Chadsweb> Mostly because of the dinosaur part though
[8:00] <Bearodactyl> plus, Europe
[8:00] <Bearodactyl> people play in Europe and the US
[8:00] <I-merican> OH.
[8:00] <I-merican> So what's up with that Resistance Retribution for the PSP?
[8:00] <I-merican> I heard goo things about it.
[8:00] <I-merican> But I bought it.
[8:00] <Kodaichi> I've found a few treasure rooms just below the ground, haha
[8:00] <Snake> Dude
[8:00] <I-merican> And it's crap.
[8:00] <Shrub> goo
[8:00] <Snake> The cave in was huge
[8:00] <Snake> It killed some mobs in the process.

[8:01] <Bearodactyl> how about you just ditch PSP games 'cause they all suck?
[8:01] <I-merican> Not true broham.
[8:01] <I-merican> Patapon is an excellent game.
[8:01] <I-merican> As is Patchwork Heroes.
[8:01] <Chadsweb> I only ever played like 2 decent PSP games
[8:01] <Kodaichi> i always wanted to try Dissidia
[8:01] <I-merican> And the Wipeout series.
[8:01] <VurtualRuler98> is it just me
[8:01] <Shrub> Dissidia sucks
[8:01] <VurtualRuler98> or did ep2, like ep1
[8:01] <Shrub> except
[8:01] <VurtualRuler98> get some terrain changes?
[8:01] <Shrub> Kefka
[8:01] <I-merican> Dissidia is...
[8:01] <VurtualRuler98> like, a hill is more dtailed
[8:01] <Kodaichi> Zidane
[8:01] <I-merican> Kind of meh.
[8:02] <Kodaichi> I loved ff9
[8:02] <Bearodactyl> lol, I think the only three games I play are minecraft, stick ranger and pokemon yellow
[8:02] <Zaneo> disgaea was good
[8:02] <Shrub> Kefka makes it awesome
[8:02] <I-merican> Patapon really is just awesome.
[8:02] <I-merican> I can't wait for the third one to come out.
[8:02] <Bearodactyl> played runescape for awhile and it got really, really boring once I got high levelled
[8:03] <I-merican> Argh.
[8:03] <Kodaichi> kefka's supposed to be one of the biggest assholes in all of gaming, isn't he?
[8:03] <I-merican> Runescape.
[8:03] <I-merican> Hmm.
[8:03] <I-merican> I don't remember which one Kefka was.
[8:03] <Chadsweb> Runescape is really awful but the idea behind it was great, mostly because you had such a huge amount of different things you could do

[8:21] <Chadsweb> Just generate a level?
[8:21] <Bearodactyl> I have a lava castle

[8:22] <Bearodactyl> so I dunno why I'm saying anything
[8:22] <Soviet> conundrumer, i think i have software i used on my logic design class
[8:22] <Zaneo> I have a simple two story house, with a cellar and tunnel
[8:22] <Soviet> btw, do you know how to do it manually?
[8:22] <Zaneo> if you want
[8:22] <VurtualRuler98> you know
[8:23] <VurtualRuler98> we really DO need a concrete block
[8:23] <Soviet> using tables of input output?
[8:23] <VurtualRuler98> & mossy concrete that occours over time
[8:23] <Conundrumer> yea
[8:23] <Conundrumer> that's what i did first
[8:23] <VurtualRuler98> that grows like grass maybe

[8:23] <Conundrumer> i realize one of te inverters is in the wrong place
[8:23] <Soviet> conundrumer, do you need help with making the simplest logic design?
[8:23] <Soviet> or you already know what to do
[8:23] <Conundrumer> i think i know what i'm doing
[8:24] <tWoolie> could you craft concrete + iron > rebar'd concrete (withstand TNT)?
[8:24] <Soviet> i have the book about it incase you want to

[8:24] <Conundrumer> I think the internet is good enough for me
[8:24] <Soviet> or you can give me table of input and output, i will do the dirty work for you
[8:24] <Bearodactyl> so I'm on a new map, trying to find coal in a cave unsuccessfully
[8:24] <Soviet> Bearodactyl: dig dig dig
[8:24] <Bearodactyl> and I'm lighting it up by digging hazardous holes to the surface
[8:24] <Bearodactyl> in the meantime
[8:24] <Conundrumer> making the table of i/o itself is tedious
[8:24] <VurtualRuler98> no rebar'd conrete would not withstand TND
[8:24] <VurtualRuler98> TNT*
[8:24] <Soviet> dig to the north, dig to the south,
[8:24] <Bearodactyl> ffff
[8:24] <VurtualRuler98> But it'd harder
[8:24] <Bearodactyl> I already stripped a small hill
[8:25] <VurtualRuler98> and if not seriously blown up by TNT, becomes one or two levels of destroyed rebar concrete
[8:25] <Soviet> conundrumer, usually, how many inputs?
[8:25] <VurtualRuler98> destroyed rebar conrete still blocks access, and looks like rebar with concrete chunked off
[8:25] <tWoolie> why can't frigging foot thick iron blocks withstand concrete, but a flimzy furnace can?
[8:25] <I-merican> I feel stupid.
[8:25] <VurtualRuler98> furnaces are filled with magic
[8:25] <VurtualRuler98> also metter thick
[8:25] <tWoolie> why can't frigging foot thick iron blocks withstand TNT*, but a flimzy furnace can?
[8:25] <I-merican> I walked right past my house in the middle of the night.
[8:25] <I-merican> And kept going.
[8:26] <Conundrumer> there's the clock, pointer state, direction, cell presence to the left/right, and 2 bit memory
[8:26] <I-merican> Until I began to wonder why I hadn't reached it yet.
[8:26] <VurtualRuler98> iron block=one meter of iron
[8:26] <tWoolie> "also metter thick" even better!
[8:26] <VurtualRuler98> furnace=8 cubic meters of stone
[8:26] <Soviet> oo
[8:26] <Bearodactyl> lol, I just accidentally'd two coal
[8:26] <Soviet> ok then, that is already as simple as i can think off
[8:26] <Bearodactyl> while mining a hole to the surface
[8:26] <I-merican> Two WHOLE COAL?!

[8:26] <Bearodactyl> to look for coal using sunlight
[8:26] <tWoolie> furnace size == iron block size
[8:26] <tWoolie> furnace = hollow inside
[8:26] <Bearodactyl> more like, eight whole torches
[8:26] <tj505050> hi
[8:26] <tWoolie> also, made from COBBLESTONE
[8:26] <VurtualRuler98> iron bars are not one iron block in size
[8:26] <VurtualRuler98> while a cobblestone block is a cobblestone block in size
[8:26] <VurtualRuler98> and you have 8
[8:26] <VurtualRuler98> compared to 1
[8:27] <Chadsweb> Cobblestone is a cool word
[8:27] <Chadsweb> "Cobble"
[8:27] <VurtualRuler98> instead of 1 block from 9 1/9ths
[8:27] <tWoolie> i'm taking bout iron block, made from 9 iron bars
[8:27] <I-merican> I come home to my house covered in sheep and pigs.
[8:27] <I-merican> Mannn.
[8:27] * Wedge (Chris___@cpe-24-161-122-150.hvc.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: Bye)
[8:27] <VurtualRuler98> you have 1 block from 1 1/1th
[8:27] <VurtualRuler98> er
[8:27] <VurtualRuler98> 8 1/1ths
[8:27] <VurtualRuler98> more matter
[8:27] <VurtualRuler98> in other words: Deeense.
[8:27] <Soviet> i guess i will start being autistic tonight by making a 4 bit counter
[8:28] * Lutin` (Sam@c-71-197-49-253.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[8:28] <Conundrumer> thing is, it's already been made
[8:28] <I-merican> : O
[8:28] <I-merican> Ok.
[8:28] <I-merican> I got home.
[8:28] <tWoolie> furnace = 8 block cobblestone. iron block = 9 ingotts FORGED IRON
[8:28] <I-merican> Had 2.5 hearts.
[8:28] <I-merican> Went to a chest to get some pork.
[8:28] <VurtualRuler98> anyways guys I'm going to bed but
[8:28] <I-merican> I heard ominous cave music.
[8:28] <Conundrumer> someone said he was making a turing machine, but he hasn't made any reference to it for a while
[8:28] <I-merican> turned around.
[8:28] <VurtualRuler98> yeah but tWoolie
[8:28] <VurtualRuler98> each bar is 1/9th a cubic meter
[8:28] <I-merican> And there was a creeper in my hallway.
[8:28] <VurtualRuler98> or LESS
[8:28] <I-merican> Just standing there.
[8:28] <VurtualRuler98> so the block might be HOLLOW
[8:29] <VurtualRuler98> while 1 cobblestone is solid stone presumably
[8:29] <VurtualRuler98> (or the world is made from hollow stones?)
[8:29] <Chadsweb> Creepers, man
[8:29] <tWoolie> but it would be IRON. not frigging pebbles
[8:29] <VurtualRuler98> (which may or may not explain how we carry smaller ones, and how 5 minecrafters could otherwise carry the RMS titanic)
[8:29] <I-merican> Ah shit.
[8:29] <VurtualRuler98> (wouldn't the RMS titanic also be hollow blocks, no net change!?)
[8:29] <VurtualRuler98> (I'm digressing now)
[8:29] <I-merican> It just blew up in my entrance hall.
[8:29] <tWoolie> pebbles held together with heated mud!
[8:29] <I-merican> Which had a glass bottom pool on top of it.
[8:29] <VurtualRuler98> tWoolie try blasting through 8 meters of solid rock
[8:30] <VurtualRuler98> solid granite
[8:30] <VurtualRuler98> compressed.
[8:30] <Chadsweb> Hahaha
[8:30] <VurtualRuler98> into 1 cubic meter
[8:30] <I-merican> So now there's a waterfall going from my roof down into my basement.
[8:30] <I-merican> God damn it.
[8:30] <tWoolie> try blasting theough 8 meters of solid steel
[8:30] <Chadsweb> Freakin' creepers, mang
[8:30] <VurtualRuler98> That's way tougher than any, aaaany metal
[8:30] <Soviet> you know what i gonna hate? creeper spawning inside my logic machine
[8:30] <VurtualRuler98> yeah but you have only 1 meter or less of solid steel
[8:30] <Conundrumer> peaceful
[8:30] <VurtualRuler98> soviet he let out all the magic smoke
[8:30] <Conundrumer> then again
[8:30] <Bearodactyl> lol, just like
[8:30] <I-merican> Argh!!!!
[8:30] <Bearodactyl> "why is there cobblestone under--oh"
[8:30] <I-merican> It put out my lava pit!
[8:30] <Bearodactyl> treasure room!
[8:30] <I-merican> FUCKING CREEPERS
[8:30] <Soviet> that is 10 hour of planing poof!
[8:31] <VurtualRuler98> anyways before I go to bed
[8:31] <tWoolie> but the furnace isnt solid rock, it's cobblestone shit. like, pebbles held together with clay
[8:31] <VurtualRuler98> I have to figure out what to download
[8:31] <Bearodactyl> so, what breaks spawn cages now?
[8:31] <Chadsweb> Well that's probably a good example of a time where a glass bottom pool on the 2nd floor of a house is a bad idea
[8:31] <Bearodactyl> diamond picks only?
[8:31] <tWoolie> it's what you build on a workbench
[8:31] <VurtualRuler98> CSS, arma 2, moonbase alpha, and red faction: geurilla(last of which is my goal)
[8:31] <Chadsweb> Especially with lava in the basement
[8:31] * FNugget (Bob@64.149.46.201) has joined #minecraft
[8:31] <VurtualRuler98> the former two are smaller and may download faster due to patching
[8:31] <tWoolie> what do you have on a workbench that can super-compress pebbles into granite
[8:31] <Bearodactyl> I tried breaking spawn cages with steel picks twice, it didn't work
[8:31] <Bearodactyl> anyooone know what I need?
[8:32] <Chadsweb> Don't spawn cages just not drop the things anymore?
[8:32] <Chadsweb> I think I heard that somewhere
[8:32] <Bearodactyl> you can't get pig spawners anymoer?
[8:32] <Bearodactyl> more*?
[8:32] <I-merican> I'm so mad.
[8:32] <Chadsweb> Well I dunno but I think someone said that somewhere at some point
[8:32] <VurtualRuler98> what shuold I be downloading
[8:32] <Bearodactyl> hm
[8:32] <Snake> Shit
[8:32] <I-merican> Was like... the worst possible place it could have broke.
[8:32] <Snake> Six pigs just spawned in my base.
[8:33] <I-merican> Because the water is also flooding my circuits in the basement.

[8:33] <I-merican> And thus I have to go down and get it before the drops disappear.
[8:33] <I-merican> I still can't figure out how they're getting into my house.
[8:33] <I-merican> It's fairly well lit.
[8:33] <Chadsweb> So was the pool worth it?
[8:34] <Snake> I now have a total TNT count of... 1.

[8:34] <I-merican> No.
[8:35] <I-merican> The pool was bollocks.
[8:35] <I-merican> Three meters deep.
[8:35] <I-merican> A pain in the ass to fill.
[8:35] <I-merican> Because it was too wide.
[8:35] <I-merican> And too long.
[8:35] <Chadsweb> Aaaand no use at all?
[8:35] <I-merican> And now, the pool is in my entry hall and basement.

[8:35] <I-merican> So as far as worth goes, I'd have to assess this as not worth it.
[8:35] <Shrub> Nonono
[8:35] <I-merican> Not worth it at all.
[8:35] <Shrub> The netry should be the pool hall in your basement.
[8:35] <I-merican> Plus.
[8:35] <I-merican> PLUS
[8:35] <Snake> Why do animals insist on falling into my moat / pit.
[8:36] <I-merican> I used smooth stone to make the pool.
[8:36] <Bearodactyl> it's not that they insist on falling into it
[8:36] <I-merican> Which means I spent all that extra time cooking it.
[8:36] <Bearodactyl> it's that they can't get out of it

[8:36] <Snake> Why would they betray me like this.
[8:36] <I-merican> But I wanted to be La-di-fucking-da fancy.
[8:36] <Shrub> Should make a SM64 pool.
[8:37] <Shrub> Should remake the SM64 castle.
[8:37] <Bearodactyl> about to suicide
[8:37] <Bearodactyl> apparently my spawn was exactly 64 blocks from the top of the game
[8:37] <Shrub> D:
[8:37] <Bearodactyl> got 64 dirt and five torches to make a signal tower as to where my spawn was
[8:37] <I-merican> Oh god why.
[8:37] <I-merican> This is so terrible to clean up.
[8:37] <Bearodactyl> and when I tried to put a torch on top of the 64 blocks of dirt, I couldn't!
[8:38] <I-merican> It's not like I had it at the top of a tower or anything.
[8:38] <I-merican> That's a cool frame of reference.
[8:39] <Chadsweb> Well to be honest
[8:39] <Chadsweb> If I was a creeper, I probably would have done the same as that one did
[8:39] <Chadsweb> More to end my life than anything though
[8:39] <I-merican> Well, at least I got the pool stopped up.

[8:43] <So_Useless> Mostly hatred and rage, though.
[8:43] <Tukiko> :[ < My creeper impression
[8:43] <I-merican> I love that fanfic.
[8:43] <Chadsweb> Unfortunately they all end up feeling that same feeling of horrible, indescribable horror and pain as they commit suicide before your eyes for the entertainment of children
[8:43] <I-merican> Of the creepers.
[8:43] <Chadsweb> A sad reality

[8:44] <AgentBaron> Can someone put that link up again? I just signed in.
[8:44] <I-merican> I dig straight down with ladders and then branch outward with thin tunnels.
[8:45] <So_Useless> I mine a four by four tunnel down one block at a time.
[8:45] <So_Useless> So it makes a slanted shaft down into the ground.
[8:45] <So_Useless> Like a staircase kind of, get what I mean?
[8:45] <So_Useless> It hasn't failed me yet... but it takes a long time.
[8:45] <I-merican> That makes sense.
[8:45] <I-merican> I do that when I'm doing stuff under buildings.
[8:46] <I-merican> So it looks nice.
[8:46] <So_Useless> Yeah.
[8:46] <So_Useless> Then I put real stairs on one side of it for easy climbing-out-of.
[8:46] <Bearodactyl> I just follow tunnels waaaay down
[8:46] <Bearodactyl> and strip mine really deep
[8:46] <I-merican> When I was looking for spergite, I just went down to the adminium and then made a big dome at the bottom.
[8:46] <Bearodactyl> about five blocks above adminblocks
[8:47] <I-merican> That seams like an easy way.
[8:47] <So_Useless> Yeah, uncovering a naturally formed cave is an exhilirating(sp?) experience.
[8:47] <I-merican> You can sort of spot check where caves are, too.
[8:47] <So_Useless> Or it was... until the spawn bug filled the caves with monsters.
[8:47] <I-merican> By toggling the render distance.
[8:47] <I-merican> You can see where monsters are underground.
[8:47] <I-merican> It's like radar.
[8:47] <So_Useless> Then I put my valuables in a chest and played creeper-mining.

[8:51] <ZarroTsu> land flags mate
[8:51] <I-merican> See, I don't think I like the land flag thing.
[8:51] <Bearodactyl> people will only use it for making gold turrets and being pimpin
[8:51] <ZarroTsu> gold will have moderate value
[8:51] <Chadsweb> Well
[8:51] <Bearodactyl> says who?
[8:51] <ZarroTsu> those who have the land they need can trade off coin to others for diamond and shit
[8:51] <Bearodactyl> I won't trade crap for gold
[8:51] <Bearodactyl> it's completely up to the buyer
[8:51] <So_Useless> I want to make a gold suit of armor if I find enough of it.

[8:55] <Chadsweb> Maybe just the ability to lock your chests, maybe drop a key to them when you're killed?
[8:55] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Luckily Notch doesn't care what you think :D
[8:55] <Bearodactyl> chest lock: sword
[8:55] <tj505050> hi
[8:55] <So_Useless> Not all problems can be solved by a sword... unless it's made of diamonds.

[8:56] <Chadsweb> Though I'd have a decoy one in my house, and then one in the floor or something
[8:56] <Snake> I got shot by an arrow
[8:56] <Snake> And now I can't find the skeleton
[8:56] <Snake> >:(
[8:56] <So_Useless> Maybe just let people claim blocks they have placed as only being destroyable by them or people they give permission?
[8:56] <So_Useless> Then just put an iron door on your house.
[8:56] <Bearodactyl> that sounds terrible
[8:57] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I'm glad Notch is able to implement ideas and fine-tune gameplay mechanics using his own coherent and focused game design plan rather than listening to every single person's ideas which they believe gain credibility through whining.
[8:57] <Bearodactyl> you could build those around someone's house
[8:57] <So_Useless> Good point.
[8:57] <SakuyaIzayoi> Chocolatey-Syrup: Yes.
[8:57] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I'm sure one way or another he will figure out how to make Land-Claim flags work logistically within his own established and ideal framework of the game's basic mechanics

[8:58] <Bearodactyl> yeah, normally he suprises me and makes a bad idea into something fun
[8:58] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I've got too many potential groups to participate in anyway
[8:58] <So_Useless> Hmm. Griefers... they are making multiplayer more complex than it needs to be. They are winning without even playing the game, yet.
[8:58] <Bearodactyl> not always (biomes = crappy snow maps instead)
[8:58] <Bearodactyl> there isn't griefing in SMP XD
[8:58] <ZarroTsu> the more fun the game gets, the more people bitch about greifing with the fun

[8:59] <Soviet> i can see that

[8:59] <ZarroTsu> lava buckets, oh noes you can drown/burn people
[8:59] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I am so looking forward to full biomes though
[8:59] <Bearodactyl> yeah, I know that, I'm just whining
[8:59] <So_Useless> Lava buckets are full of win.
[8:59] <Bearodactyl> withholding information is a logical fallacy, I get it
[8:59] <ZarroTsu> I'm looking forward to the desert biome, honestly
[8:59] <I-merican> I mean, what conflicts do you have once land claim flags are in effect?
[8:59] <Soviet> I-merican: explains the flag please
[8:59] <Chocolatey-Syrup> But if I had to pick one thing I wanted more than any other for tomorrow's update, it would be powered minecarts :Ic
[8:59] <Bearodactyl> I just hope he doesn't make it so there aren't biomes, only themed maps
[8:59] <So_Useless> I just don't like the idea of logging back in to find my hard work ruined, that's all.

[9:00] <mnjiman> play single player
[9:00] <Chocolatey-Syrup> you're*
[9:00] <Chocolatey-Syrup> :3c
[9:00] <Bearodactyl> or make friends and always have your city guarded
[9:00] <mnjiman> or play on a care bear puppy server
[9:00] <mnjiman> otherwise stfu
[9:00] <So_Useless> No need to be so hostile.
[9:00] <I-merican> That's what I feel like land claim flags will do.
[9:00] <Chocolatey-Syrup> technically you can't be a care bear AND a puppy.
[9:00] <I-merican> Make everyone live in their own little bubbles.
[9:00] <mnjiman> seriously are you too stupid to come up with these idea's yourself?
[9:00] <Scrippy> Apparently multiplayer survival maps will only be able to host around 8 players at once on your average servers.
[9:00] <Chocolatey-Syrup> holy crap this guy is so mad
[9:00] <Scrippy> I am dissapoint.
[9:00] <Dys|Sleep> Whch guy

[9:01] <Chocolatey-Syrup> that one

[9:01] <Chocolatey-Syrup> also you don't need to put an apostrophe in plurals
[9:01] <mnjiman> where?
[9:01] <Chocolatey-Syrup> you
[9:01] <So_Useless> I smell a troll?
[9:01] <mnjiman> him?
[9:01] <I-merican> ...Uh.
[9:01] <I-merican> What?
[9:01] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Okay then.
[9:01] <So_Useless> Nevermind.
[9:01] <ZarroTsu> I wonder the fun of rain in the game's future
[9:01] <I-merican> But seriously.
[9:01] <ZarroTsu> I'd assume there will be surface puddles
[9:01] <Scrippy> That fun should be caps.
[9:01] <I-merican> What is supposed to happen once everyone is walled up in their little bubbles?
[9:01] <Scrippy> Like Fun.

[9:02] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I-merican how about, I dunno, exploring, building, and fighting through caverns?
[9:02] <Soviet> one flip and the rest of land around is a big crater
[9:02] <ZarroTsu> "Geeze this rain has been going on for nearly a day now, and-- OH FUCK MY HOUSE IS FLOODING"
[9:02] <mnjiman> Im asking how the heck would people be in bubbles in the first place?
[9:02] <Bearodactyl> oh wait, I can't mine here, someone put a flag over this land
[9:02] <Chocolatey-Syrup> If this game was about setting up safety and never leaving it, then you could just seal yourself into the ground and consider it "won"
[9:02] <Bearodactyl> how boring *leaves*
[9:02] <Scrippy> ...Bubbles?
[9:02] <I-merican> By bubbles I mean land claim flags.
[9:02] <I-merican> Everyone cloistered in their own little claims.
[9:02] <Scrippy> I think those are dumb.
[9:02] <Soviet> if it is land claim flag, i think it will be probably dump place for inventories
[9:02] <Chocolatey-Syrup> haha bearodactyl jesus christ
[9:02] <I-merican> No one else can enter them.
[9:03] <Scrippy> I want to be part of a roving team.

[9:03] <Scrippy> Who craft accross the land.
[9:03] <Soviet> probably it is accessible but not allowed to affect the environment inside
[9:03] <Chocolatey-Syrup> so you really think there's going to be any significant limiting in where you can mine?
[9:03] <Soviet> as permanently not destructible by 3rd party
[9:03] <Scrippy> I wish servers would have a bigger host.
[9:03] <Chocolatey-Syrup> It's not like the land is going to be bought up wholesale to its depths.
[9:03] <Bearodactyl> that's a small problem
[9:03] <I-merican> I don't think there will be limits.
[9:03] <Bearodactyl> the big problems are fighting through other players to find that their treasure is claimed
[9:03] <I-merican> But the whole point of multiplayer is to interact with each other, yes?
[9:03] <Scrippy> No, it will not be.
[9:03] <Scrippy> The way the game is structured
[9:04] <Bearodactyl> why have it survival? why not just call it "co-op happyland"
[9:04] <Chocolatey-Syrup> jesus christ
[9:04] <Chocolatey-Syrup> because there are still monsters?
[9:04] <Soviet> i can see coop server can work
[9:04] <Scrippy> The limit will be roughly 8 people on your average server.
[9:04] <ZarroTsu> then make your server peaceful with no monsters
[9:04] <I-merican> Monsters are weaksauce.
[9:04] <Soviet> but that is IF it is preset
[9:04] <Bearodactyl> you think monsters are hard to kill?

[9:04] <Scrippy> Notch said that himself.
[9:04] <Chocolatey-Syrup> You don't fight other players right now, do you call singleplayer Happyland?
[9:04] <vede> The point of SMP is cooperation.
[9:04] <Bearodactyl> especially with other players co-oping?
[9:04] <I-merican> They are not a threat to even one person.
[9:04] <ZarroTsu> my server will be on easy with a normal huge sized map
[9:04] <Bearodactyl> it's, pretty happyland, yeah
[9:04] <Scrippy> If you were like google or somebody crazy,
[9:04] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I-merican I know plenty of people who'd disagree
[9:04] <Scrippy> You might be able to host 600 or so.
[9:04] <Chocolatey-Syrup> and anyway Bear you can still steal from players inside their land claim flags
[9:04] <So_Useless> And co-op would probably be more fun than fighting people for their shit? The point of the game is to create, right? The name doesn't really allude to that, but creation is the reason a significant portion of people play it.
[9:04] <Scrippy> But that's goddamn google.
[9:04] <Soviet> I actually believe that flag system is useful to certain extend
[9:05] <Shrub> Yes
[9:05] <I-merican> Like who?
[9:05] <Bearodactyl> well yeah, which is why like
[9:05] <Shrub> and it's not like it has to be used
[9:05] <Bearodactyl> when someone's losing a fight
[9:05] <Soviet> at least to protect my chests
[9:05] <Bearodactyl> they run to their land
[9:05] <Bearodactyl> and stuff all of their valuables in a chest
[9:05] <I-merican> You can beat any of the monsters with your bare hands.
[9:05] <Chocolatey-Syrup> then you use
[9:05] <Chocolatey-Syrup> a bow
[9:05] <Bearodactyl> that they have claimed
[9:05] <vede> Also, saying something should have a different title because the mechanics change is among the worst possible arguments you can ever make in a discussion about games.
[9:05] <Soviet> Bearodactyl: i ran to my fort when i was dying
[9:05] <Chocolatey-Syrup> okay, bear, then you take all their shit OUT of their chests.
[9:05] <Chocolatey-Syrup> and then you have it
[9:05] <Bearodactyl> I can't, it's claimed
[9:05] <Chocolatey-Syrup> yes you can
[9:05] <Bearodactyl> then why have claiming at all?
[9:06] <Scrippy> You will be able to loot chests
[9:06] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I just said that Notch confirmed you can still steal from other people's chests within land claim flags
[9:06] <Scrippy> Even on claimed land.

[9:06] <Bearodactyl> yeah
[9:06] <tj505050> smart
[9:06] <Chocolatey-Syrup> then kill them while they're trying to break it away and stash their stuff!
[9:06] <Soviet> Chocolatey-Syrup: i guess trap is now used against other player then
[9:06] <Bearodactyl> that's why land-claim is ridiculous
[9:06] <vede> "I think Minecraft should have paintings for decoration!" -> "It's called Minecraft, not Happy Paintings On Walls Game"
[9:06] <Chocolatey-Syrup> hahaha vede
[9:06] <Bearodactyl> easier said than done
[9:06] <I-merican> So, all a land claim flag would do is stop you from breaking blocks?
[9:06] <ZarroTsu> sigh
[9:06] <mnjiman> i thought it had paintings
[9:06] <Chocolatey-Syrup> that's been the community outcry every step of the way, Vede
[9:06] <Scrippy> Trap the outside of their door while they're inside?

[9:07] <Bearodactyl> you could even just walk around with a claiming flag
[9:07] <Bearodactyl> claim some land
[9:07] <Shrub> ugh

[9:07] <vede> Crafting. "It's called MINECRAFT, not ARTS AND CRAFTS WITH BLOCKY STUFF"
[9:07] <Bearodactyl> neither do you
[9:07] <Chocolatey-Syrup> THAT'S MY POINT
[9:08] <Bearodactyl> yet you argue the same as I do

[9:08] <Soviet> MINECRAFT by design is "WHATEVER craft"
[9:08] <Scrippy> It's called MINECRAFT
[9:08] <I-merican> Assuage our fears.
[9:08] <I-merican> Do it.
[9:08] <So_Useless> Well, let's just see what notch comes up with, then?
[9:08] <I-merican> Please.
[9:08] <Scrippy> And by MINECRAFT
[9:08] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I'm telling you your argument is stupid, because it's based on nothing!
[9:08] <Scrippy> i mean
[9:08] <Shrub> I wonder how much land flags will actually claim.
[9:08] <Bearodactyl> you're defending something that he's barely thought-out
[9:08] <So_Useless> It isn't even a big deal.
[9:08] <I-merican> I want to be comfortable with this.
[9:08] <Scrippy> FIRST PERSON AUTISM SIM SIMULATOR
[9:08] <Bearodactyl> tu-quoque
[9:08] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I'm defending it because he has a good track record.
[9:08] <mnjiman> glad i didnt nerd rage, chocolatey-syrup is kicking ass for me
[9:08] <Bearodactyl> you too
[9:08] <ZarroTsu> many people seem to forget their own capability of leaving any game server at any time, as well as being able to make their own. There will be servers of all shapes and sizes, and possibly a griefer-specific server wherein you start with a shitload of TNT. Something for everyone.
[9:08] <ZarroTsu> Land flags aren't /needed/, however they will help /destinguish whose land is whose/ in the natural event of people expanding their home locations.
[9:08] <Bearodactyl> snow maps sure are biomes
[9:08] <vede> Bearodactyl, you're attacking something that he's barely thought out, so maybe you should shut up too.
[9:08] <Chocolatey-Syrup> BOLD TEXT MAKES ME MORE CREDIBLE

[9:09] <Chocolatey-Syrup> My point is that Notch has a good track record for implementing things, even the things that many people thought wouldn't work out. Complaining about how a feature will be exploited when even Notch hasn't decided how they'll work yet is pointless. That's my point.
[9:09] <tj505050> what kind of hax
[9:09] <So_Useless> I agree that the argument is pointless.

[9:12] <mnjiman> two different words
[9:12] <mnjiman> lewl
[9:12] <I-merican> this doesn't even have anything to do with what we were talking about...
[9:13] <Shrub> nubcake: Browser or offline client/
[9:13] <Soviet> nubcake: not quite sure, but i thought the game resever that much?
[9:13] <Bearodactyl> people use it when talking about Star Wars all the time
[9:13] <Bearodactyl> comparing the fact that they have pants and play jazz
[9:13] <nubcake> Shrub: Client. Browser is slightly less but not that much of an improvement.
[9:13] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Man I'm saying that you are dumb for attacking this and all you can do is use big words incorrectly and say "yeah well YOU'RE stupid for pointing out how I'M stupid!"
[9:13] <Laughing> i see talk of jazz
[9:13] * mnjiman (Mibbit@d24-57-104-173.home.cgocable.net) has left #minecraft
[9:13] <Soviet> just because people use it all the time doesn't mean it is correct
[9:13] <Shadaez> you're dumb
[9:13] <Bearodactyl> they call it "anachronistic"
[9:13] <Laughing> what is going on in here
[9:13] <Soviet> look at the term pedophilia
[9:13] <Bearodactyl> how about actually attacking my argument and not the words I'm using?
[9:13] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Why wouldn't people have pants in star wars
[9:13] <Shrub> No, Bearodactyl, shh.
[9:13] <Bearodactyl> that's called "ad hominem"
[9:13] <Shrub> Bearodactyl
[9:13] <Chocolatey-Syrup> no it isn't
[9:13] <So_Useless> I had anachronism explained to me by a large woman under a table, wearing a medival style dress. Therefore, I cannot take the discussion of anachronism seriously because that image comes to mind every time I hear the word.
[9:13] <Bearodactyl> ehehehehe
[9:13] <I-merican> Can we stop it.
[9:13] <Shrub> You don't HAVE an argument
[9:13] <I-merican> Please.
[9:13] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Ad hominem is attacking you
[9:14] <Laughing> bearodactyl sounds crazy man
[9:14] <Shrub> You're stabbing in the dark about this.
[9:14] <Laughing> crazy
[9:14] <nubcake> Jeez this chat moves fast.
[9:14] <Soviet> let's restart the argument
[9:14] <Shrub> Now if both of you stop arguing.
[9:14] <nubcake> Shrub: Client. Browser is slightly less. Not really though.
[9:14] <Soviet> screw big words
[9:14] <Bearodactyl> lol, chocolatey
[9:14] <Shrub> nubcake: Yes, that's normal
[9:14] <Bearodactyl> it's really hard to take your words of wisdom seriously
[9:14] <vede> Which would be related to time, Bearodactyl. A serf wearing a digital watch is anachronistic, people playing Jazz a long time ago (it just also happens to be in a galaxy far far away) is also anachronistic, and it's still because of the clash in time periods.
[9:14] <Shrub> its max is 1GB
[9:14] <Chocolatey-Syrup> and as for attacking your point, I did that already, and then you just reverted to "yeah well you're stupid because you argued that I was making a pointless argument"
[9:14] <Bearodactyl> when you get this worked up over a troll
[9:14] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I think I have just the thing for this
[9:14] <Laughing> PILLAR OF AUTUMN
[9:14] <nubcake> Shrub: It just seems that lately I'm getting a lot of frame skips and low fps. Before it ran fine.
[9:15] <Chocolatey-Syrup> oh no I guess I didn't save it
[9:15] <Shrub> Ah, end process
[9:15] <Shrub> then just restart.
[9:15] <Shrub> make sure you save /
[9:15] <Soviet> nubcake, does that happen in the beginnig of the game or after 10 minutes or something?
[9:15] <Bearodactyl> or whatever I guess I can continue
[9:15] <Shrub> also, Bearodactyl
[9:15] <I-merican> I am uncomfortable with the idea of land flags restricting destruction of blocks or looting chests to the owner. However, if all they do is say that the land is owned by someone, I have no problem with them.
[9:15] <Shrub> bah I forgot what I was gonna say
[9:15] <Chocolatey-Syrup> suffice it to say, "I WAS TROLLING!" is the last resort of a cornered internet debater
[9:15] <Shrub> I-merican: They
[9:15] <nubcake> Soviet: Constantly. I'll be running smooth at 35 fps. And suddenly 13 then back up again.
[9:15] <Bearodactyl> so.
[9:15] <Shrub> They'll likely just increase block destruction/placement time and that's about it
[9:15] <Soviet> I-merican: I will be confortable if it is limited by how many flag you can get
[9:16] * Roadcrosser (im-a-pc@116.206.167.73) has joined #minecraft
[9:16] <I-merican> How much has notch said on the topic?
[9:16] <Bearodactyl> you're attempting this still? I can continue if you'd like me too
[9:16] <I-merican> I've seen people throwing around bold text.
[9:16] <Chocolatey-Syrup> http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/6817/realtrolls.png
[9:16] <Soviet> nubcake, what i can guess is.. there is something running in pulse in the background
[9:16] <Chocolatey-Syrup> there we go
[9:16] <So_Useless> Water will do that, too. Water cubes over structures? I did it earlier. It was a fun time.
[9:16] <Soviet> either your computer or the game
[9:16] <Chocolatey-Syrup> that's what I was looking for~
[9:16] <nubcake> Soviet: Pulse?
[9:16] <Bearodactyl> you can put flags around someone who has claimed their own land
[9:17] <Bearodactyl> rendering their claimed land useless
[9:17] <Shrub> lol
[9:17] <Shrub> oh bear
[9:17] <Shrub> you're so silly
[9:17] <Soviet> like running once every minute like indexing service or. antivirus
[9:17] <I-merican> That reminds me of Haven and Hearth.
[9:17] <Shrub> pointing holes in a system that doesn't exist yet
[9:17] <Bearodactyl> because, they can no longer expand
[9:17] <I-merican> Where people would claim land and build walls.
[9:17] <Bearodactyl> as there is a wall of mean around them

[9:17] <I-merican> But then someone would just trap them inside with their own walls.
[9:17] <nubcake> Soviet: Hmmm I see. Any typical ones you can think of that I need to look out for?
[9:17] <vede> Bearodactyl, that's their fault for not hiding their land and killing the people who surrounded theirs.
[9:17] <Soviet> Bearodactyl: if it is denial of access then yes, but if it is denial of change, then the siege-r must build wall around
[9:17] <I-merican> That sounds really paranoid.
[9:18] <Bearodactyl> so, vede
[9:18] <I-merican> Looking every ten seconds up on the surface?
[9:18] <Bearodactyl> why not just kill people instead of claiming land at all
[9:18] <Soviet> Soviet: not sure, try look at the task manager if you have indexing running
[9:18] <Bearodactyl> that's a lot more like survival
[9:18] <vede> ALSO, Bearodactyl, you seem like you know quite a bit about how those land-claim flag thingies will work.
[9:18] <I-merican> "What the fuck is that guy doing over there? Is he holding a flag? I THINK HE'S HOLDING A FLAG!"
[9:18] <SakuyaIzayoi> So wait are you guys talking about ways to keep your own things secure in Multiplayer Survival?
[9:18] <Bearodactyl> I do.
[9:18] <vede> Really?
[9:18] <Bearodactyl> I've seen them.
[9:18] <Soviet> nubcake not sure, try look at the task manager if you have indexing running
[9:19] <vede> I'm sure everyone here would like to know, since you seem to be so in-the-know.
[9:19] <Bearodactyl> they claim land.
[9:19] <Soviet> SakuyaIzayoi: yes, keeping your pads safe
[9:19] <Bearodactyl> they're a flag and they claim land
[9:19] <Shrub> Ugh, God.
[9:19] <I-merican> Wh-...Where have you seen them?
[9:19] <So_Useless> Asthetic flags would be nice.
[9:19] <Soviet> but it shouldn't work all the way to hell though
[9:19] <Shrub> So_Useless
[9:19] <Shrub> yes
[9:19] <Shrub> like placeable flags
[9:19] <SakuyaIzayoi> Here's a thought: Only play with friends in a password protected game
[9:19] <Soviet> it should have z-direction limitation
[9:19] <Bearodactyl> in the minds eye
[9:19] <Shrub> with your own graphics
[9:19] <SakuyaIzayoi> Problem solved
[9:19] <So_Useless> Yeah. flagpoles.
[9:19] <nubcake> Soviet: No I don't. I have AVG but it doesn't seem to be doing much. Hm. My cpu usage is not too bad. It jumps from 30-50 but never above that.
[9:19] <Shrub> Yeah :D
[9:19] <I-merican> In the minds eye?
[9:19] <Bearodactyl> saku has the right idea for people who want to claim land
[9:19] <I-merican> Surely that isn't part of the game?
[9:19] <Soviet> nubcake: in that case, I don't know. sorry can't help
[9:19] <Bearodactyl> play your own darn game
[9:20] <Bearodactyl> public survival isn't survival with land claim
[9:20] <Chocolatey-Syrup> pfffahahahahahaa
[9:20] <Chocolatey-Syrup> <Bearodactyl> public survival isn't survival with land claim
[9:20] <Bearodactyl> "oh sorry, I claimed everything before someone else got on incase they griefed"
[9:20] <Chocolatey-Syrup> oh man
[9:20] <vede> Bearodactyl, no, it's "Happy Cooperation Fuzzy Carebear Land Mode" right?
[9:20] <Chocolatey-Syrup> yeah man

[9:21] <nubcake> Soviet: It's fine. Thanks for trying though. Maybe I'll shoot notch an email or twitter or whatever.
[9:21] <Chocolatey-Syrup> thousands of land claim flags
[9:21] <Chocolatey-Syrup> and claimed the entire map
[9:21] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I bet
[9:21] <Shrub> ARGH STOP THE DAMN ARGUMENT I SWEAR.
[9:21] <Shrub> Everybody gets all riled up
[9:21] <Shrub> when we talk about SMP.
[9:21] <So_Useless> It's just a game and all that.
[9:21] <So_Useless> Chill out.
[9:21] <Shrub> Thank you.
[9:21] <I-merican> Suffice to say, we're not quite sure what they will do?
[9:21] <Shrub> Also

[9:21] <Bearodactyl> public ones with land-claim are "wow this is really slow and boring" lands
[9:21] <Shrub> Until Notch actually RELEASE INFORMATION ABOUT IT.
[9:21] <I-merican> I've gotten hearsay, but I don't know what Notch actually said...
[9:21] <Chocolatey-Syrup> <Bearodactyl> Guys this is how land claim flags will work and these are the specific gameplay mechanics that will be exploited with them TRUST ME I KNOW WHAT I AM SAYING. Also I'm right and you're wrong. Unless I'm wrong. Then I was trolling <3
[9:21] <vede> Shrub, we actually talk about SMP a lot, and we don't get riled up.
[9:21] <Shrub> Yes
[9:21] <vede> Bearodactyl's just a jackass.
[9:21] <Bearodactyl> trolling is completely misusing ad hominem after accidentally misusing another word to get your riled up
[9:21] <Bearodactyl> my entire argument is real
[9:21] <Bearodactyl> not trolling
[9:22] <Shrub> True
[9:22] <Shrub> Bearodactyl
[9:22] <Shrub> listen to us
[9:22] <So_Useless> Then let us shun him?
[9:22] <vede> *That's* what's getting everyone riled up.
[9:22] <Shrub> Don't stab in the dark about informatiion
[9:22] <So_Useless> Shun the nonbeliever...
[9:22] <Soviet> i am starting to think that the flag might be handed out by admin one by one
[9:22] <Shrub> When Notch tells everybody about land-claim flags
[9:22] <Chocolatey-Syrup> "Wow this is really slow and boring" is something someone would say after playing a world like that and interacting with the land claim flags, not speculating wildly on a nebulous idea~
[9:22] * lightsoda (lightsoda@c-94-255-179-158.cust.bredband2.com) has joined #minecraft
[9:22] <Shrub> Then we will discuss
[9:22] <Shrub> land-claim flags
[9:22] <Soviet> it will be set that no one can change it except admin
[9:22] <VurtualRuler98> So like, we heard dogs barking.
[9:22] <VurtualRuler98> Ever since we've had a multiple chain of crimes occouring in the town, and how last year or two had lots of kidnappings and such
[9:22] <So_Useless> What?
[9:22] <I-merican> It occurs to me that the entire point of spergite torches is power source stuff, not lighting.
[9:22] <VurtualRuler98> Bearodactyl trolling is like, gettin' people angry
[9:22] <Shrub> to get a reaction
[9:22] <I-merican> I was irritated up until now that they didn't light things up.
[9:22] <Bearodactyl> only silly people angry
[9:22] <Shrub> Doing what you said
[9:22] <Shrub> is called 'failing an argument'
[9:22] <So_Useless> Spergite? Sorry, but where does that name come from? Just out of curiosity.
[9:23] <VurtualRuler98> so yeah, after someone tried to steal from my house, and then did OTHER crimes to make up for fees and whatnot
[9:23] <Soviet> trolling is intentional fallacies to waste others' time to explain
[9:23] <I-merican> Oh.
[9:23] <VurtualRuler98> spergite/aspergite=aspergers
[9:23] <Bearodactyl> I saw my chance and abused that chance, you could subjectively call it whatever you want

[9:23] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I have an even better image for this
[9:23] <VurtualRuler98> anyyyways
[9:23] <Snake> I was fighting two zombies and a creeper and my sword broke
[9:23] <VurtualRuler98> to be on the safe side
[9:23] <I-merican> And I got used to calling it that.
[9:23] <Bearodactyl> so, what you guys cooould do
[9:23] <VurtualRuler98> I dug for a baseball bat in the closet full of sports goods
[9:23] <So_Useless> I like it.
[9:23] <VurtualRuler98> no bat
[9:23] <Snake> So I turned around to find a safe place to craft a sword
[9:23] <Bearodactyl> instead of telling me not to stab in the dark
[9:23] <So_Useless> Better than redstone or thermite.

[9:24] <tj505050> omg the torches will burn out
[9:24] <VurtualRuler98> I grabbed those, headed into the basement, and grabbed my semi-concealed bow
[9:24] <Bearodactyl> instead of being anachronistic
[9:24] <VurtualRuler98> And got ready for some tactical bow application
[9:24] <VurtualRuler98> nothing out there

[9:24] <I-merican> Oh god.
[9:24] <Shrub> lol vurtual
[9:24] <Chocolatey-Syrup> <Bearodactyl> Whenever I use words wrong I do it on purpose. Same with faulty arguments. By pointing out how dumb I am you fell RIGHT INTO MY CLEVER TRAP

[9:25] <Shrub> why does my dad always talk to condescendingly on the phone
[9:25] <Shrub> so*
[9:25] <Bearodactyl> what's wrong with my argument? all you've told me is to not stab in the dark
[9:25] <Soviet> i think those who pretend to be dumb can be and must be legitimately viewed as dumb in the context of conversation
[9:25] <I-merican> You know what.
[9:25] <SakuyaIzayoi> Cocolatey-Syrup: That is the basics of most trolling
[9:25] <Bearodactyl> you've given me no solutions
[9:25] <I-merican> My mom does this thing when she's hanging up.
[9:25] <Shrub> Your argument isn't an argument
[9:25] <VurtualRuler98> so yeah
[9:25] <I-merican> Where she sort of giggles in the back of her throat.
[9:25] <VurtualRuler98> I have a bow and arrow.
[9:25] <I-merican> It perplexes me to no end.
[9:25] <Shrub> O.o
[9:25] <VurtualRuler98> I have multiple kinds of arrow for one bow
[9:25] <So_Useless> Soviet: But then you are giving them exactly what they want.
[9:26] <Shrub> I reckon Arrow Types would rock
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> and another really powerful bow I have a mildly hard time firing, which we take down big game with
[9:26] <Shrub> FIRE ARROWS *hua*
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> like bears and stuff
[9:26] <SakuyaIzayoi> My mom laughs as she says goodbye. Like "Ahahabye"
[9:26] <I-merican> "mhmehmhmh bye.
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> I have a big game hunting bow.
[9:26] <Chadsweb> Like a sheep?
[9:26] <Soviet> So_Useless: if what they want is admitance that they are dumb
[9:26] <Bearodactyl> well no, that's failure trolling. Trolling is selfishly pretending to be something you aren't not to get people to insult you but to get them riled and show off how many dumb things they can say
[9:26] <Soviet> then it is legitimate to think they're purely dumb
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> and big game, small game, medium game, and human game hunting guns.
[9:26] <Shrub> Bear, shh.
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> and multiple forms of melee weapons.
[9:26] <So_Useless> Fire arrows kind of exist. A skeleton shot at me through a lava flow and narrowly avoided setting my head on fire.
[9:26] <Soviet> after all, what does it take to pretend to be dumb
[9:26] <Chocolatey-Syrup> man he is still talking isn't he
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> I am prepared.
[9:26] <Bearodactyl> if they instantly see that you are trolling, they tell you to f off and you're an idiot
[9:26] <I-merican> Argh.
[9:26] <Shrub> D:
[9:26] <SakuyaIzayoi> Trolling is doing something to get people to react a certain way
[9:26] <I-merican> You know how you get set on fire and it stays lit?
[9:26] <Chocolatey-Syrup> bearodactyl, your an idiot, please leave~
[9:26] <SakuyaIzayoi> Typically that is anger
[9:27] <Bearodactyl> if they start on a contradictive rampage, you've succeeded
[9:27] <I-merican> I died three times from lava doing that.
[9:27] <VurtualRuler98> guys, can you burn mobs with burning arrows?
[9:27] <Bearodactyl> D=
[9:27] <VurtualRuler98> I-merican, peaceful
[9:27] <Bearodactyl> you don't have to go after my feelings...now...
[9:27] <Bearodactyl> I haven't insulted you
[9:27] <Chadsweb> That is hilarious
[9:27] <SakuyaIzayoi> hur hur u speeled 'you're' wrong, chocolatey
[9:27] <Soviet> trolling has no place in discussion
[9:27] <tj505050> omg im bored
[9:27] <I-merican> Perhaps on 4chan it does.
[9:27] <So_Useless> Unless we are discussing successful trolling techniques.
[9:27] <I-merican> Maybe not anywhere else...
[9:27] <Chocolatey-Syrup> So, anyone have any ideas for what we're getting tomorrow?
[9:27] <Snake> Even though I'm hopefully lost
[9:27] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Notch laid down about a thousand possibilities in yesterday's stream
[9:27] <Chadsweb> You know actually I don't think I'd ever like doing peaceful all that much, the enemies kind of add more to it, so I have more to think of and more things to do
[9:27] <Bearodactyl> land-claim flags
[9:27] <Shrub> Chocolatey: SMP
[9:28] <Chocolatey-Syrup> It could be anything
[9:28] <I-merican> Notch mentioned fixing some mp glitches.
[9:28] <Chocolatey-Syrup> you wish shrub
[9:28] <Snake> I keep exploring the caves further
[9:28] <Soviet> there is only one legitimate usage of trolling, againts those who do not have brain to start with.
[9:28] <Shrub> Yes
[9:28] <Bearodactyl> anyone have any ideas as to what land-claim flags will be like when he implements them tomorrow?
[9:28] <vede> We really need to get more ops in this channel.
[9:28] <Shrub> Yes I Do
[9:28] <Soviet> aka, the evangelists.
[9:28] <So_Useless> Jetpacks.

[9:28] <Shrub> thank you Soviet
[9:28] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I'm with you tj
[9:28] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Trains would be awesome
[9:28] <vede> Someone could flood this place with links to shock sites right now and no one would be here to do anything about it.
[9:28] <tj505050> i would like to be op
[9:28] <Bearodactyl> so you want trains, not invented until the 1800s
[9:28] <I-merican> ...Are you sure?
[9:28] <Bearodactyl> but not flintlocks, invented in the 1500s?

[9:29] <I-merican> Realistically, there were guns at the same time as the Knights.

[9:29] <tj505050> horses yea

[9:29] <Bearodactyl> yeah soviet, like when people don't catch you misusing things multiple times, people like that are idiots
[9:30] <Bearodactyl> yeah, there were guns a looong time ago, but that'd suck so much for minecraft
[9:30] <Bearodactyl> kindof like trains
[9:30] <SakuyaIzayoi> And outlaws
[9:30] <Chadsweb> Cowboys
[9:30] <tj505050> and fire bows
[9:30] <So_Useless> Aw man, I hope we get cows tomorrow.
[9:30] <Chadsweb> Ayyyy
[9:30] <SakuyaIzayoi> And a guy named John Marston
[9:30] <tj505050> no tnt bows
[9:30] <SakuyaIzayoi> who has a dark past
[9:30] <I-merican> Argh.
[9:30] <SakuyaIzayoi> But wants to save his family
[9:30] <I-merican> Saku, you sniped me.
[9:30] <SakuyaIzayoi> By appeasing a corrupt government
[9:30] <I-merican> Or rather, beat me to it.
[9:30] <Soviet> SakuyaIzayoi: can i see your pads :3
[9:30] <SakuyaIzayoi> But in the end he has to sacrifice himself
[9:30] <Soviet> please~
[9:30] <Bearodactyl> but that windmill was pimpin'
[9:30] <tj505050> ok whos playing multiplayer
[9:30] <Bearodactyl> beats trains

[9:30] * jesus is now known as Shrub
[9:30] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Trains would be rad you're trippin' bear
[9:30] <Shrub> Yes.
[9:30] <Shrub> Also cannons.
[9:30] <I-merican> Trains would be so hot.
[9:30] <Soviet> Bearodactyl: the point of trolling is trying to convince someone that you're idiot

[9:30] <I-merican> And they're practically a reality.
[9:30] <tj505050> i like trains so i can ride them and snipe people with my tnt arrows
[9:30] <So_Useless> Trains would rock. Especially if we get mobile lights and can affix one to the front of the train.
[9:30] <Chadsweb> Cannons would be cool
[9:30] <Shrub> Yes.
[9:31] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Guns fulfill a role already filled by arrows, but in an overpowered way with no compensation. Trains fill a role that is not curently filled.
[9:31] <Grumb> Hey guys.
[9:31] <Shrub> Sniper Trains
[9:31] <Soviet> sometimes people do not have the heart, or they try to fix you
[9:31] <Shrub> with cannons on them
[9:31] <Shrub> WAR TRAINS.
[9:31] <Chocolatey-Syrup> How about guntrains
[9:31] <Chadsweb> Though the planning would be rather lame, unless you could aim and shoot with it
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> itt people don't know how a gun works
[9:31] <Chocolatey-Syrup> trains that ARE guns
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> or how a bow works
[9:31] <So_Useless> WAR TRAINS!!!
[9:31] <Soviet> while others are equally dumb and can't see the idiocy
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> Okay, guys, I have an important PSA for you.
[9:31] <I-merican> Wait.
[9:31] <Shrub> Trains with Cow Catchers
[9:31] <Chadsweb> Instead of just lighting it and hoping it hits something
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> Guns and bows are different.

[9:31] <Bearodactyl> soviet, that'd be retarded and you would be an idiot
[9:31] <I-merican> guns would require gunpowder to fire, correct?
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> Archery is a powerful weapon, capible of seriously screwing someone up.
[9:31] <Bearodactyl> and windmills fulfill trains
[9:31] <So_Useless> A cannon that shoots arrows, like a giant shotgun?
[9:31] <tj505050> i would also like to be able to store stuff in them like you used to be able to
[9:31] * Dys|Sleep (IceChat7@cpe-70-112-156-80.austin.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[9:31] <Shrub> I imagine you make the guns
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> It takes practice to deal with arrow flight, and at extreeeme ranges, arrow drop
[9:31] <I-merican> That means you would need lots of gunpowder to fire them repeatedly?
[9:31] <Shrub> and then make the bullets, and the bullets contain gunpowder
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> However, a trained archer never needs to reload or use a sight system.
[9:31] <Chocolatey-Syrup> So, a ballista then, So_Useless?
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> They can just reflexively fire.
[9:31] <Bearodactyl> soviet, trolling is getting other people to publically show they are an idiot by pretending to be dim yourself
[9:31] <Soviet> the fact that the other party can see that you're idiot means that the trolling fails
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> Guns, however, are different.
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> big guns, and firearms
[9:32] <So_Useless> Yeah, but cannon-shaped.
[9:32] <Bearodactyl> not to show off that you are one
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> the former is nothing similar at all
[9:32] <So_Useless> For extra fun.
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> while the latter is still incredibly different from archery.
[9:32] <I-merican> Perhaps guns would require powder and gullets.
[9:32] * Shrub74 (poop@58.165.140.222) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[9:32] <So_Useless> And perhaps comically large arrow-shells to load into it.
[9:32] <Soviet> what you want is that you're making someone else to talk stupidly
[9:32] <Chocolatey-Syrup> No one said guns and bows are the same thing
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> you have to steady your weapon(you're not stretching out your arms to fire it, and you don't have two hands or anything) ALL THE TIME, INTENSIVELY
[9:32] <Chocolatey-Syrup> But they fulfill the same role
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> they take practice to deal with sights
[9:32] <tj505050> what about being able to put stuff in the carts
[9:32] <SakuyaIzayoi> I would be okay with cannons because of poor aiming capabilities
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> they're functionally different weapons of a different use
[9:32] <Chocolatey-Syrup> and nitpicking the minutiae of either in a game like minecraft is braindead
[9:32] <Bearodactyl> I got chocolatey to contradict himself by saying that you shouldn't shoot in the dark, followed by him shooting in the dark himself
[9:33] <Bearodactyl> not through trolling though, I'll admit I didn't think out my troll well
[9:33] <Bearodactyl> and bailed
[9:33] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Listen to yourself
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> (firearms gore with a bullet, and attempt to deal pain)
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> (arrows basically skewer you and kill you that way)
[9:33] <Shrub> Conveyor Belts would be cool
[9:33] <Shrub> for mines
[9:33] <Chocolatey-Syrup> "you have to steady your weapon(you're not stretching out your arms to fire it, and you don't have two hands or anything) ALL THE TIME, INTENSIVELY" does this sound like minecraft to you
[9:33] <vede> VurtualRuler98, an extensive lecture on the differences between bows and guns really wasn't needed in the discussion.
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> Yeah I'm sure.
[9:33] <Chocolatey-Syrup> really man
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> Just waiting for a downsy 14 year old ot learn how to port forward
[9:33] <Soviet> do you know why i want troll to be used only againts evangelists? because they will not listen to reasons anyway
[9:33] <tj505050> well rember when you could use a cart like a chest
[9:33] <I-merican> I remember a quote from some king.
[9:33] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Man bear
[9:33] <I-merican> Or someone.
[9:33] <Chocolatey-Syrup> you are still talking I noticed
[9:33] <vede> You just wanted to show yourself off to make it look like you're cooler than you are, I'm sure.
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> nah I'm just bored
[9:33] <I-merican> If you want to train an archer, start with his grandfather.
[9:33] <Bearodactyl> soviet, that is mean XD
[9:33] <Bearodactyl> they are people too
[9:34] <VurtualRuler98> this kid is so dumb and is trying to get me to help him which is PULLING ME AWAY FROM MY GF
[9:34] <Bearodactyl> though I admit I've never met a smart evangialist
[9:34] <Soviet> Bearodactyl: if you think I am mean, need me to bring a mirror?
[9:34] <Bearodactyl> it's unfortunate
[9:34] <So_Useless> I hate helping people with computer problems.
[9:34] <Chocolatey-Syrup> what are you stupid that's not how you do it
[9:34] <Chocolatey-Syrup> you do it like this
[9:34] <Chocolatey-Syrup> MY GIRLFRIEND
[9:34] <Bearodactyl> I'm rubber your glue etc etc
[9:34] <tj505050> lol
[9:34] <VurtualRuler98> Chocolatey-Syrup that's hardly unusual for someone like me
[9:34] <I-merican> What the hell, man.
[9:34] <Shrub> XD
[9:34] <VurtualRuler98> the unusual part is where I'm also female
[9:34] <I-merican> I lost track of this conversation somewhere.
[9:34] <I-merican> But I'm not sure when it happened.
[9:34] <tj505050> well trains that carry stuff wwould be awesome
[9:34] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I'M A GIRL

[9:35] <Shrub> vurtual are you hot
[9:35] <Chadsweb> Women are myths
[9:35] <Chocolatey-Syrup> I wish this channel supported colors so I could put that in rainbow
[9:35] <tj505050> hi omg boobs
[9:35] <Roadcrosser> so first they don't even HAVE sandwiches when I finally went there to get one, then my friend didn't come to give me the edible gel I was waiting for, I'm sick of tuna sandwiches, and got demoted on a server as a misunderstanding. How worse can this day get? the only good thing that happened today was that I got 3 As in a row for a subject I'm not good at. That's being outweighed by all the bad stuff.
[9:35] <Soviet> Chocolatey-Syrup: what kind of Chocolate?
[9:35] <Chocolatey-Syrup> EVERYONE PAY ATTENTION TO MEEEEEE
[9:35] <So_Useless> Bewbs?
[9:35] <Bearodactyl> only females tend to do that

[9:36] <Chadsweb> We're all trying to say something but we're going too slow to keep up with the current topic
[9:36] <So_Useless> Hmm.
[9:37] <Bearodactyl> consistency or persistance?
[9:37] <Roadcrosser> oh well
[9:37] <Chocolatey-Syrup> Consistency.
[9:37] <Roadcrosser> time to quit MC

[9:37] <vede> So later on this whole scenario will be more convincing than it already is that we need more ops.
[9:37] <Bearodactyl> early homo-sapian hunters didn't hunt with consistency
[9:37] <tj505050> yes its Pr0
[9:37] <Bearodactyl> they hunted with persistence

[9:38] <Bearodactyl> proving my well-built theory that persistence is better than consistency

[9:38] <I-merican> Anyone buildanything interesting at all?
[9:38] <I-merican> So far?
[9:38] <Bearodactyl> yes
[9:38] <VurtualRuler98> not 2 for sure
[9:38] <VurtualRuler98> 35565 right
[9:38] <Soviet> i dont give merit on persistency and consistency though

[9:40] <So_Useless> I built a house that was protected by a lavafall on all sides, I-merican. I was proud of it.
[9:40] <I-merican> Oh yeah?

[9:40] <tj505050> told ya
[9:40] <vede> Bearodactyl, if you're persistent people act like they agree with you until you go away because they loathe your presence.

[9:40] <So_Useless> Lava buckets>swords
[9:40] <Bearodactyl> it worked, didn't it?
[9:40] <So_Useless> I haven't done anything with spergite, yet.
[9:40] <I-merican> Anyone made any crazy confusing contraptions with magic dust yet?
[9:40] <Bearodactyl> either way, God already proved that I'm right by giving me 7 diamond
[9:40] <Dezerus> Red Dust...
[9:40] <I-merican> All I've done is make a door open and close in my basement.
[9:40] <tj505050> mei made a trap
[9:41] <Dezerus> Not aspergite.
[9:41] <So_Useless> I wish you could make trapdoors.
[9:41] <tj505050> i put it at the spawn
[9:41] <I-merican> I know the real name, thank you Deserus.
[9:41] <So_Useless> Make a watertrap with spergite.
[9:41] <MongrelArchitect> merican - i made a little minecart ride with a series of switches to determine where I end up
[9:41] <VurtualRuler98> red stone.
[9:41] <Soviet> nothing like hundreds of mines around spawn area

[9:43] <Soviet> btw, those who stand on panel will usually get the panel as complementary gift of death

[9:45] <Roadcrosser> In monotone: I might have ADHD
[9:45] <I-merican> Oh man.
[9:45] <So_Useless> An idea has occured: three verticle blocks of iron, a below that, and then a mine below that.
[9:45] <I-merican> I would fuck that server.
[9:45] <VurtualRuler98> is mc tcp or udp
[9:45] <VurtualRuler98> why don't I remember this :|

[9:46] <Shrub> Holy shit somebody needs to make a server exactly like thta
[9:46] <Soviet> i actually want the door act as a switch as well
[9:46] <Shrub> that's the best idea I've ever heard
[9:46] <I-merican> And then monsters started swarming out as the real track was revealed.
[9:46] <tj505050> could you anagine a floor covered in wswitches that dident do anything
[9:46] <Soviet> when you open it, it will have a surge of power
[9:46] <Snake> Fuuuuuu
[9:46] <tj505050> well pressure plates
[9:46] <Snake> Skeleton shoots me into lava
[9:47] <tj505050> it would be trippy
[9:47] <Snake> I get out
[9:47] <Snake> Creeper explodes on me
[9:47] <Snake> I'm still alive ( I love you armor)
[9:47] <Bearodactyl> I was thinking about making people jump over ledges through a tunnel
[9:47] <So_Useless> They are organizing.
[9:47] <Snake> Burning, almost dead
[9:47] <So_Useless> This doesn't bode well.
[9:47] <Snake> Pork.
[9:47] <Bearodactyl> so they stop checking the other side of the ledge
[9:47] <tj505050> to have a floor covered in pressure plates and tnt in plain site
[9:47] <Bearodactyl> and eventually hide a pressure plate
[9:47] <Soviet> you know what will be awesome? the moment you enter a corridor and the ceiling drop mines blocking your way out

[9:47] <Soviet> the only way to hide pressure plate is by having more pressure plates
[9:48] <I-merican> Well.
[9:48] <tj505050> im gunna makke a house with pressur plates covering the floor

[9:48] <Soviet> this is why i want conductive block
[9:48] <Bearodactyl> before indev at all, I used to make traps in creative
[9:48] <So_Useless> clickclickclickclickclick.
[9:48] <Bearodactyl> that went to lava at the bottom
[9:48] <Bearodactyl> by just making ledges people had to jump over, followed by holes

[9:49] <Shrub> Block
[9:50] <Shrub> So we can have cool-ass fights
[9:50] <Bearodactyl> heh. block. minecraft.
[9:50] <So_Useless> Bear, make it so they have to fall into water after every ledge, so they get in the habit of falling straight down to avoid damage. Makes the trap hole easier to place and they will fall in more reliably.
[9:50] <tj505050> notch says bring it on via the client
[9:50] <Bearodactyl> heh
[9:50] <Bearodactyl> lava in a deep pit on the fifth or sixth ledge
[9:50] <So_Useless> With a visible chest just before they fall in.
[9:50] <Bearodactyl> distraction
[9:51] <Bearodactyl> and no field of pressure plates

[9:52] <VurtualRuler98> So, I'm about to transfer the guy after it wasn't working
[9:52] <Soviet> what is hard is linking the right one without being noticeable
[9:52] <VurtualRuler98> he forgot to tick enable on the port forward

[10:06] <Bearodactyl> I've been lying this whole time
[10:06] <Soviet> I-merican: what i want is controlled
[10:06] <Bearodactyl> no, it's a Dm chord, followed by a Cmajor chord, then an A#major, then an A major
[10:07] <Grumb> I'm guessing that's sarcasm Bear.
[10:07] <EmpiresBane> of course it is
[10:07] <Grumb> Haha.
[10:07] <Bearodactyl> if you played the notes D, C, A#, A, it would sound exactly like it without the 3rd and 5th notes in the chords
[10:07] <So_Useless> I want a catapult to launch blocks around.

[10:07] <Soviet> assuming we can have strong block againts TNT, or admin-block,
[10:07] <Grumb> Who are we talking about? Led Zep?
[10:07] <Bearodactyl> which is Am, G, F, E
[10:07] <So_Useless> For long-distance building.
[10:07] <I-merican> The way cannons are made now, you basically need a team of six people with the parts for it memorizing exactly what they need to do to set up a cannon facing a certain direction.
[10:07] <Soviet> we can have a launcher
[10:08] <Bearodactyl> like, I know 100% that you're wrong so I'll wait for you to prove me wrong
[10:08] <Bearodactyl> please do
[10:08] <Shrub> Well, for one
[10:08] <Shrub> I wrote it

[10:09] <Bearodactyl> oh, good job, that was well-made for an independent
[10:09] <Shrub> Thank you :P
[10:09] <Bearodactyl> then you should know the first chord is a Dm
[10:10] <Bearodactyl> I'm playing it on my Uke right now
[10:10] <Shrub> It's a Gm.
[10:10] <Bearodactyl> funnily enough that matches perfectly with my Uke's alternative tuning

[10:13] <EmpiresBane> hey, Bearodactyl
[10:13] <Bearodactyl> so you should know that this is the same progression as babe I'm gonna leave you in a different key then
[10:13] <Bearodactyl> and we're all on the same page
[10:13] <Grumb> What's the difference with college/university <.< I thought it was just different countries called it different things
[10:13] <Shrub> It's NOT.
[10:13] <Shrub> University is awesomer.
[10:13] <EmpiresBane> going to college doesn't mean anything...
[10:13] <So_Useless> University is for rich kids?
[10:13] <Bearodactyl> do I reeeaally have to get off my webpage and look it up?
[10:13] <I-merican> It's just people being stuck up.
[10:14] <I-merican> I go to a state university.
[10:14] <Bearodactyl> and yeah, I go to a community college because I'm poor XD no problem getting a scholarship though, already offered one
[10:14] <Bearodactyl> not where I want to go though
[10:14] <So_Useless> Hmm. My college is called a university, now that I think about it. And they are pretty stuck up.
[10:14] <So_Useless> They let someone like me in, though... so they can't be completely bad.

[10:17] <Snake> It wasn't a walk in the park
[10:17] <Bearodactyl> best time for sea perch
[10:17] <Zelacks> I made a gold safe that has 6 switches, and the door only opens when the switches are in the right postition
[10:18] <Bearodactyl> and rays, but who wants them

[10:18] <Dark207> so many foot steps
[10:18] <EmpiresBane> i'm more likely to throw my sister out the indow and play
[10:18] <Dark207> cant tell if its a creeper or the many pigs/sheep
[10:18] <EmpiresBane> *window
[10:19] <Bearodactyl> that's the intro part of the song and it's even wrong, because it's all minor chords
[10:19] <I-merican> The creepers don't make any noises, do they?
[10:19] <Bearodactyl> the part later with the electric guitar in it is the one that's like your song
[10:19] <Shrub> Well we were talking about the intro weren't we
[10:19] <Dark207> they dont?
[10:19] <So_Useless> I thought everything made footsteps.
[10:19] <Dark207> ._.
[10:19] <Bearodactyl> no, there are multiple parts to the song
[10:19] <I-merican> I never heard them.
[10:19] <Shrub> and no, there's 3 majors.
[10:19] <So_Useless> Though, creepers seem to sneak up on me more often than anything else.
[10:19] <Bearodactyl> and I even looked, but couldn't find any chords for the whole song
[10:19] <So_Useless> So, I guess they don't.
[10:19] <Dark207> im making a sword..
[10:19] <Bearodactyl> oh, you put capital "M"s for majors, I see
[10:20] <Dark207> just in case
[10:20] <Bearodactyl> little new-school XD
[10:20] <Shrub> Yes.
[10:20] <Shrub> Indeed.
[10:20] <So_Useless> Shields would be cool.
[10:20] <Shrub> So you're talking about the heavy epic bit?

[10:23] <Bearodactyl> unless I completely read your thing wrong
[10:23] <Shrub> yeah
[10:23] <Bearodactyl> nevermind that, but yeah, go on with finding the epic aprt XD
[10:23] <Shrub> after the semicolon is my thing
[10:23] <Bearodactyl> incorrectly interpreted your post
[10:23] <Shrub> yeah /
[10:23] <Bearodactyl> I was like "well wait..."
[10:24] <Bearodactyl> but you shouldn't even have to look up the epic part
[10:24] <Bearodactyl> look up the song and listen
[10:24] <Shrub> I did
[10:24] <Whiskerz> whats all this then
[10:24] <Shrub> It dissonates
[10:24] <Cintiq> is there any way to make a door unopenable by mobs?

[10:25] <Whiskerz> whats the arguement
[10:25] <Bearodactyl> ...what do you mean? that
[10:25] <Bearodactyl> dissonates? I guess since the chords are a half step away at the end
[10:25] <Bearodactyl> but that's a weird way to use that word

[10:25] <Cintiq> what do i do with the iron door
[10:25] <Cintiq> iron pressure plate with it?
[10:25] <I-merican> I feel like I need to order some new baoding balls.
[10:25] <Shrub> Whiskerz: he's comparing that song I wrote that I showed you to a Babe I'm Gonna Leave You by Led Zeppelin
[10:25] <Whiskerz> Levers are a good choice Cintiq
[10:25] <I-merican> You should make a security door, Cintiq.
[10:25] <Bearodactyl> it's the same though, there's a minor difference and that is that E is held on a half measure further than F
[10:25] <So_Useless> Stone pressure plate, lever, or switch... or wood if you suck.
[10:25] <Whiskerz> You showed me a song?
[10:25] <Cintiq> I-merican, how2
[10:25] * elitekiller500 (elitekille@ip68-9-219-51.ri.ri.cox.net) has left #minecraft
[10:26] <I-merican> The kind that only can be opened by stopping current flow to it.
[10:26] <Bearodactyl> and only for some of the song
[10:26] <Shrub> Whiskerz: Slow Burn - Smoking Clover
[10:26] <So_Useless> Wood pressure plate*
[10:26] <Whiskerz> Oh
[10:26] <Whiskerz> Hmm
[10:26] <I-merican> So that way, when you turn the current on, it stays on, the door stays shut, until you interrupt the current.
[10:26] <Snake> Wow
[10:26] <Snake> In the days I was underground
[10:26] <I-merican> I can't for the life of me figure out how to do it with a wooden door, though.
[10:26] <Snake> I planted a bunch of trees before going on that trip
[10:26] <Bearodactyl> wish I had something that wasn't a 4track tape recorder so I could show off my music XD
[10:26] <Shrub> I can't even any more
[10:26] <I-merican> So chances are I can't do it properly with an iron door.
[10:26] <Cintiq> want to draw a diagram?
[10:26] <Snake> Now I have a forest outside my house
[10:26] <Cintiq> :P
[10:26] <Dark207> creeper ahoy!
[10:26] <I-merican> I would look it up.
[10:27] <I-merican> I'm trying to figure it out too, man.
[10:27] <Dark207> TWO creepers?
[10:27] <Shrub> Might records something :/
[10:27] <Dark207> creepers come out in the day time? or just in dark places?
[10:27] <I-merican> Apparently it CAN be done.

[10:28] <Bearodactyl> crap
[10:28] <So_Useless> I-merican, don't you put the door on the square you normally would but turn it a different way so it blocks the doorway when the door is in what would normally be the open position?
[10:28] <Bearodactyl> GH
[10:28] <Shrub> lol
[10:28] <Bearodactyl> good hank
[10:28] <So_Useless> That is how I saw someone do it on the forums, I think.
[10:28] <Bearodactyl> N
[10:28] <Shrub> I'll give you a Good Hank, Bearodactyl :#
[10:28] <Shrub> :3
[10:29] <Dark207> woot i killed two spiders!
[10:29] <I-merican> I don't know, useless.
[10:29] <Dark207> :D
[10:29] <Dark207> fun!
[10:29] <Bearodactyl> man I just totally nodded back to a pick nodding at me in greetings
[10:29] <I-merican> I'm not sure I understand what you mean.
[10:29] <Dark207> normal mode is fun when its not night time :D
[10:29] <I-merican> Although that sounds like it might be the process.
[10:30] <So_Useless> Like, the door is normally placed where it blocks the entrance when in the closed position. If you turn 90 degrees and place it on that same block, it should block the doorway when in the open position.
[10:30] <Bearodactyl> oh, and I'll be honest with you, I dropped out of the music program because I hated it and went into anthropology instead
[10:30] <Whiskerz> I need more PB&J, brb
[10:30] <Bearodactyl> I'm self taught almost 100% musically
[10:30] <Shrub> D:
[10:30] <Bearodactyl> anthropology > music schoolwise
[10:30] <So_Useless> Hooray for history.
[10:30] <Shrub> I'm self-taught exactly 100% musically :P
[10:30] <I-merican> That doesn't seem to work, Useless.
[10:31] <Bearodactyl> lol, I can't say that because I know what chords are called
[10:31] <So_Useless> Ah, well maybe I have it wrong, then.
[10:31] <Whiskerz> I guitar hero taught
[10:31] <Bearodactyl> and what a circle of fifths is
[10:31] <Bearodactyl> and stuff like that
[10:31] <Shrub> lol Wshikerz
[10:31] <Bearodactyl> I didn't invent that
[10:31] <I-merican> Because someone can still get the door open by putting powder next to it.
[10:31] <So_Useless> I see.
[10:31] <So_Useless> Well, I dunno, then.
[10:31] <I-merican> I'm thinking it only works with iron doors.
[10:31] <Shrub> Bearodactly maybe you'd care to listen to some other music of mine? :3 jk
[10:31] <Bearodactyl> what instruments do you play in the shrub? I assume guitar?
[10:31] <I-merican> I just got some extra iron, so maybe I'll try it with that.
[10:31] <Bearodactyl> lol, sure really
[10:31] <Bearodactyl> I have nothing better to do
[10:31] <So_Useless> K.
[10:32] <Shrub> Guitar, Drums, Piano/Keyboards, harmonica
[10:32] <So_Useless> Electric harmonica.
[10:32] <Bearodactyl> I won't hesitate if I recognize the chord progression though
[10:32] <Bearodactyl> oh nice, the whole band
[10:32] <Shrub> And I have no other recorded music... that I want anybody to hear P
[10:32] <I-merican> What, no brass intruments?
[10:32] <Shrub> :P
[10:32] <Shrub> Oh
[10:32] <Bearodactyl> fff
[10:32] <So_Useless> I used to play the trombone.
[10:32] <Shrub> I did play Trumpet a couple years back
[10:32] <I-merican> I'm a trombonist.
[10:32] <Shrub> I forgot about that
[10:32] <Shrub> Tromboner*
[10:32] <So_Useless> There... there isn't a less sexy instrument.
[10:32] <Bearodactyl> I'm only just learning trumpet

[10:33] <Bearodactyl> I play accordion, ukulele, guitar, drums, harmonica, clarinet and keys
[10:33] <I-merican> My friend named his tuba Bonquisha.
[10:33] <Bearodactyl> I wish I could do it, I'm really bad at it
[10:33] <Bearodactyl> and I love how they sound
[10:33] <Shrub> I've always wanted to learn Accordion
[10:33] <Bearodactyl> unfortunately I'm best at guitar and I hate it
[10:33] <Bearodactyl> accordion is my favorite XD
[10:33] <So_Useless> I was last-chair in our trombone section, though. I was so bad at it.
[10:33] <Shrub> Yeah :D
[10:33] <Bearodactyl> hence it being first on the list
[10:33] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[10:33] <Shrub> Accordion looks so fun
[10:33] <Shrub> and romantic
[10:33] <Bearodactyl> I love the way accordions sound
[10:34] <Shrub> I could woo chicks with poetry
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> nah, that's concertina stuff
[10:34] <So_Useless> Likewise, bear.
[10:34] <I-merican> I was around mediochre.
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> small accordions, basically
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> that play in one key
[10:34] <Shrub> Also I looooove playin' Organs
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> those are the romantic ones
[10:34] <I-merican> I was in the concert band for a while.
[10:34] <Whiskerz> I hoping my grandma gives me her hammond organ when she moves, then ill learn that
[10:34] <I-merican> Then moved to first chair in that.
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> I play eastern cocek
[10:34] <I-merican> Then moved to around medium in the symphonic band.
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> mainly, with the accordion
[10:34] <Shrub> I want to learn every musical style ;-;
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> and a bit of western adaptation of middle eastern folk
[10:34] <Soviet> when can we have music instrument in minecraft?
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> I don't
[10:34] <Bearodactyl> screw most of it
[10:34] <Soviet> making your own music with some logic gates
[10:34] <So_Useless> I got out of the band early. Probably because I was so bad that I found it unrewarding.
[10:35] <So_Useless> It would have helped if I had practiced.
[10:35] <Bearodactyl> music's fun man
[10:35] <I-merican> I haven't played my trombone in years.
[10:35] <Bearodactyl> play something that you want to play
[10:35] <I-merican> I really should dust it off.
[10:35] <Bearodactyl> I really want a french horn, it's next on my list
[10:35] <I-merican> I get the urge almost every day.

[10:35] <Bodie> i also get the urge almost every day
[10:35] <Bodie> sometimes twice
[10:35] <Shrub> Bearodactyl, I think I'm starting to like you.
[10:36] <So_Useless> If I were to learn a new instrument, it would probably be something with a bow. I love the sound of cellos, violins and whatnot.
[10:36] <Whiskerz> GAAAY
[10:36] <Shrub> Omg Violin
[10:36] <Shrub> That's what I'm gonna learn next
[10:36] <Bearodactyl> I do like violins, but I know I can't get passionate about them
[10:36] <Shrub> Just so I can do this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKsEwPSI79U
[10:36] <Bearodactyl> girls seem to totally rock at violin, so I'm actually trying to buy one for my girlfriend XD
[10:36] <Bearodactyl> they're expensive too
[10:36] <I-merican> My little brother sat on his violin.
[10:37] <I-merican> It was so fucking funny.
[10:37] <I-merican> He brought it home.
[10:37] <Shrub> I want to buy a Stradivari
[10:37] <Shrub> just so I can say
[10:37] <I-merican> And the bridge was snapped right in half.
[10:37] <Shrub> 'Bitch, I have a stradavarius"
[10:37] <So_Useless> Desecration.
[10:37] <Shrub> D:
[10:37] <I-merican> Luckily it was under warranty.
[10:37] <Shrub> Time for a cup of tea :D
[10:37] <So_Useless> Shit. Legend of zelda music on the violin! Song of storms, too!
[10:37] <I-merican> God damn it.

[10:39] <I-merican> It's 2am, and I'm getting that shit.
[10:39] <I-merican> Oh man.
[10:39] <Shrub> Spit Valves
[10:39] <I-merican> My spit valve rotted out the cork.
[10:39] <Shrub> ugh
[10:39] <I-merican> And starte leaking.
[10:39] <Shrub> I hated dealing with those
[10:39] <I-merican> Then the spring pin came out.
[10:39] <Whiskerz> I learnt Flute in like year 5
[10:39] <Shrub> so I put silica gel on it :D
[10:39] <I-merican> And oh god.
[10:39] <I-merican> I don't even want to think about it.
[10:39] <So_Useless> So it dripped while you played?

[10:40] <Shrub> Argh
[10:40] <Whiskerz> Learning Saxophone would be pretty cool
[10:40] <Shrub> Where is my classic controller
[10:40] <Bearodactyl> it sounds like an autistic troll singing to me
[10:40] <Shrub> Saxophone would rock
[10:40] <I-merican> I wanted to learn saxaphone when I first started out.
[10:40] <Bearodactyl> saxophone too, hate that XD sorry, have to disagree
[10:40] <So_Useless> Yeah, I was never a clarinet fan.
[10:40] <Shrub> Bearodactyl: Are you sure it's not a tape recorder? :D
[10:40] <Dark207> wooo
[10:40] <Dark207> crafted my first bow :D
[10:40] <Whiskerz> Just sit on my porch playing baker street to random passers by for the hell of it, thatd be the life
[10:40] <I-merican> But the way you determined it in middle school was thus:
[10:40] <So_Useless> Brass is where it's at. Suck it, woodwinds.
[10:41] <Shrub> lol
[10:41] <Shrub> I hate woodwinds
[10:41] <So_Useless> CHOOSE A SIDE, SAXAPHONE! WE'RE AT WAR!
[10:41] <Bearodactyl> lol, my only attatchment to the computer
[10:41] <I-merican> You blew into a mouthpiece for the instrument you wanted, and if you made a sound, you got it.
[10:41] <Shrub> I can't write anything with them except piccolo :(
[10:41] <Bearodactyl> is a little hey you pikachu mike
[10:41] <I-merican> I could not get a saxaphone mouthpiece to play.

[10:44] <epaGamer> ;]
[10:44] <Shrub74> if you're talking TUBULAR MOTHERFUCKING BELLS.
[10:44] <Bearodactyl> music is the existence of rythm and melody
[10:45] <Bearodactyl> percussion only has rythm
[10:45] <CyanRyan> >implying hitting things with other things is music
[10:45] <I-merican> A piano is percussion, isn't it?

[10:45] <Bearodactyl> xylophone, well, retards call it percussion, like band teachers

[11:15] <Bearodactyl> how many syllables does "ought" or "aught" have to you guys?
[11:15] <Whiskerz> 1
[11:15] <Whiskerz> well

[11:24] <Shrub> Yes!
[11:24] <Dark207> '<something> (State obvious effects of that something)'
[11:24] <Whiskerz> I just noticed you were doing that
[11:24] <Dark207> e.g
[11:24] <I-merican> "Look, this girl is making out with a baby! A NUDE baby!"
[11:24] <Bearodactyl> XD, I've made really nice ones for James from Team Rocket and Fujimoto from Ponyo
[11:24] <Dark207> 'bang bang (your dead)'

[11:25] <Shrub> Girl's Camp = Band Camp with more flutes
[11:25] <Whiskerz> Sexy Pillow Fights
[11:25] <Whiskerz> :D
[11:26] <Bearodactyl> and if you think she's awesome because she plays instruments and minecraft, she doesn't really XD

[11:26] <Bearodactyl> she's devoted most of her minecraft time to making skins
[11:26] <I-merican> I need to go check them.
[11:26] <Shrub> I'm think I'm DLing a Czech Win95 O.o
[11:26] <Whiskerz> hah
[11:26] <Bearodactyl> and only plays flute and piccolo and not often
[11:26] <Bearodactyl> and not with me
[11:26] <Whiskerz> So you aint gonna tap that till marriage?
[11:27] <Bearodactyl> nope. What else would we do anyway?
[11:27] <Bearodactyl> "oh yay...we're married...nothing new..."
[11:27] <Whiskerz> huh?
[11:27] <Whiskerz> Marriage seems kinda pointless to me
[11:27] <I-merican> Oh quite the contrary.
[11:27] <Whiskerz> As an Atheist
[11:27] <Bearodactyl> plus she's led a sheltered life, I'm the worst thing that ever happened to her
[11:27] <I-merican> There is plenty of new sexual stuff to do after marriage.
[11:27] <Bearodactyl> that's the point, marraige is useless unless you chaste things up
[11:27] <Bearodactyl> thus, marraige is useful
[11:27] <Whiskerz> I dont plan on getting married ever
[11:27] <Shrub> really?
[11:28] <Whiskerz> mhmm
[11:28] <Bearodactyl> it's really good for kids to be married, lol
[11:28] <Shrub> yes it is
[11:28] <I-merican> Ok, this is going to sound really lame, but I was kind of hoping to reach the singularity before getting married.
[11:28] <Whiskerz> Oh im not saying i dont want to be married strongly
[11:28] <Bearodactyl> oh and *casts lure* athiesm is a religion *cough*
[11:28] <Whiskerz> Like the hoe will want it most likely, so ill go along

[11:30] <Dark207> then they made this stupid ui bug
[11:30] <Whiskerz> I used to be much worse, what with the crashing ever second

[11:30] <Whiskerz> I have no problems with it ATM

[11:31] <Dark207> I like this
[11:31] <Bearodactyl> lol, honestly I just try to be spiritual because I think it's a waste not to be
[11:31] <Bearodactyl> it doesn't work really well
[11:31] <Bearodactyl> I mean, I'm reading GEB and Life of Pi right now
[11:31] <I-merican> I think the universe is perfectly beautiful without having to make shit up.
[11:31] <Shrub> Yes
[11:31] <Shrub> So do I.
[11:31] <Shrub> Thank you I-merica
[11:31] <Shrub> n
[11:31] <Bearodactyl> it's impossible to be spiritual while understanding that stuff
[11:32] <Grumb> Is there a way, you can change tracks with red dust, so I can change it from the start of the track?
[11:32] <Dark207> yes
[11:32] <Dark207> you can change tracks with red dust
[11:32] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl lol spiritual, and you try to act like you're intelligent
[11:32] <Dark207> if that's what yer askin
[11:32] <Bearodactyl> I try anyway though, it feels nice to imagine that the river you're sitting by is alive and has feelings
[11:32] <Grumb> So you can control a lever with red dust?
[11:32] <Dark207> agreed Bearodactyl
[11:32] <I-merican> It might.
[11:32] <Dark207> yes
[11:32] <I-merican> We don't know.
[11:32] <Grumb> Alright I'll try.
[11:32] <I-merican> It could have some previously undetectable stream of consciousness.
[11:33] <Dark207> X = Red dust - = Line of red dust L = Lever
[11:33] <Dark207> B = block
[11:33] <Dark207> now
[11:33] <Shadaez> what is wrong with you people
[11:33] <Bearodactyl> I also enjoy imagining there is an afterlife, and I like imagining what it might be, but I know I have no idea and there's no way of knowing
[11:33] <Dark207> I'll EXPLAIN
[11:33] <I-merican> That we don't find out about till we've somehow killed every river in the world.

[11:35] <Soviet> what i did is making a chain or wire aroud the base
[11:35] <Shadaez> I-merican yet you care so much about this stupid stream-of-consciousness of rivers that you'd like to imagine
[11:35] <Bearodactyl> men eat animals, it's proven in their teeth
[11:35] <Shrub> dark did you just imply cookies == biscuits?
[11:35] <I-merican> Did I say that?
[11:35] <Dark207> yes
[11:35] <Shrub> That's because rivers are cool
[11:35] <I-merican> I just said it's possible.
[11:35] <Soviet> wired it with pulser
[11:35] <Dark207> they're teh same thing.
[11:35] <I-merican> That wasn't me.
[11:35] <Bearodactyl> and men are spiritual, it's proven in the last 700,000 years

[11:40] <Soviet> yea, cause i hate repairing stuff
[11:40] <Dark207> Lol delete a block then BOOOOOM
[11:40] <Bearodactyl> most evolutionists can't even tell you how evolution works XD literally most, a majority
[11:40] <Soviet> might as well blow it up

[11:40] <Dark207> that'd be so funny
[11:40] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl "XD" - lost all credibility
[11:40] <Soviet> don't worry, i have 8 second countdown
[11:40] <Dark207> HOLY SHIT
[11:40] <Soviet> i am just tring to make a wired wall
[11:40] <Dark207> I mined some sand then fuck loads of sand fell off the roof
[11:40] <Dark207> T_T
[11:40] <Dark207> almost caved me in
[11:40] <Soviet> so, destroying it will trigger de-synch
[11:41] <Soviet> you cannot extend the ore because of the 15 ore limit
[11:41] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl and how is spirituality important?
[11:41] <Soviet> you cannot create a pulse that actually synch
[11:41] <I-merican> Can't you put a not gate at the end?
[11:41] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl other than controlling the masses
[11:41] <I-merican> What's the problem?
[11:41] <Shrub> sex
[11:41] <I-merican> A double not gate?
[11:41] <Bearodactyl> Humans have used it to their advantage for at least 700,000 years
[11:41] <Shrub> Explain how?
[11:41] <Bearodactyl> back when there weren't masses
[11:41] <I-merican> It's on the wiki...
[11:41] <Soviet> I-merican: assuming i can get the extension system to work
[11:41] <Soviet> no one can tamper with the wire
[11:41] <Bodie> Bearodactyl: boobs?
[11:41] <Bearodactyl> for one, most found spirituality in their environment
[11:42] <I-merican> I haven't used it.
[11:42] <Bearodactyl> and therefore treated it with respect
[11:42] <Bearodactyl> a lot of it is false cause too
[11:42] <Bearodactyl> when they danced and rain came, they were happy
[11:42] <Bearodactyl> and danced more
[11:42] <Shrub> I wish we were still like that today
[11:42] <Bodie> spirituality isn't religion though
[11:42] <Bodie> religion is evil
[11:42] <Bearodactyl> when a black circle covered the sun, they started beating their drums and the circle went away
[11:42] <Shrub> lol
[11:42] <Bodie> spirituality is more of a personal thing
[11:42] <Dark207> oh god
[11:42] <Dark207> no
[11:42] <Bearodactyl> so they beat their drums every time a black circle comes
[11:42] <Dark207> don't start the religion subject
[11:42] <Bearodactyl> a lot of people also believed in reincarnation and an afterlife
[11:42] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl so what does this have to do with it being important
[11:42] <Soviet> the only way to temper with the system is by blowing the pulse
[11:42] <Bearodactyl> and that's what kept them alive
[11:43] <I-merican> Speaking of things that aren't bullshit.
[11:43] <Dark207> Religion makes me crai D:
[11:43] <I-merican> I have a program on hand.
[11:43] <Bearodactyl> it's very important and human minds enjoy spirituality
[11:43] <I-merican> Called Redshift.
[11:43] <Soviet> by blowing up the pulse means blowing up the rest as well
[11:43] <Shrub> If we weren't so smart we wouldn't need the afterlife :(
[11:43] <Bearodactyl> and writhe inside without it
[11:43] <I-merican> That lets you find out where things will be visible in the sky at any time.

[11:43] <I-merican> It's so cool.
[11:43] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl lol go do some yoga
[11:43] <Bearodactyl> simple things such as hope and reliance are spirituality, and people need that
[11:43] <Bearodactyl> I hate yoga it hurts
[11:43] <I-merican> Man, I need to do yoga.
[11:43] <I-merican> My back is so fucked up.
[11:43] <Brick> I hate Yoda.
[11:44] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl you don't need spirituality to have any of that
[11:44] <Bearodactyl> you're just making false assumptions as to what kind of person I am and it's very ignorant, similiar to the evangialists you probably hate
[11:44] <Shadaez> just intelligence
[11:44] <Brick> Ignooorant! Stop being soooo ignoooorant!
[11:44] <Shadaez> Brick ignant
[11:44] <Bearodactyl> you need spirituality to not cut down all of the trees in your area
[11:44] <Shrub> lolinganr
[11:44] <Brick> I so ignant
[11:44] <Shrub> No you don't
[11:44] <Bearodactyl> because you'll "anger a god" or spirit or something
[11:44] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl not really

[11:44] <I-merican> Common sense will tell you not to cut down all your trees.
[11:45] <Shrub> then you stop cuttin' wood
[11:45] <Bearodactyl> intelligence works too, but for most of history and prehistory, we didn't have scientific data
[11:45] <Bearodactyl> only stories
[11:45] <I-merican> We do now.
[11:45] <Bearodactyl> yeah, and spirituality isn't important physically anymore
[11:45] <Brick> I cut down all of my trees, made them into a big pile and set fire to them.
[11:45] <Shrub> sex
[11:45] <I-merican> Therefore the old stuff is obsolete.
[11:45] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl okay, so it "was important" aka it played a large role in the past
[11:45] <DEElekgolo> "I can't believe they've actually don it. Not long left. They were warned, but they just had to keep pushing the boundaries of science. The noise. I can't take teh noise anymore. And the light, dear God! THe Universe is slowly unravelling around us. I'm not going to wait for death. I have a pistol in the attic."
[11:45] <Bearodactyl> only mentally. Spiritual people don't commit suicide
[11:45] <I-merican> Wait, wait, wait.
[11:45] <I-merican> This was a good lure.

[11:46] <Brick> That's brilliant.

[11:47] <Brick> I'm ready for a beat-down
[11:47] <Bearodactyl> then you shouldn't be atheist. atheism is a religion.
[11:48] <Bearodactyl> there's no proof that there is no god.
[11:48] <I-merican> But it was actually one of those speakers.
[11:48] <Shadaez> rofl
[11:48] <I-merican> That's made to looke like a landscaping ornament.
[11:48] <Bearodactyl> for all you know there's a purple lemur who watches you day and night
[11:48] <Bearodactyl> because you don't know there isn't
[11:48] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl athiesm isn't a religion
[11:48] <Brick> I want a purple lemur.
[11:48] <Bearodactyl> it very much is, is there proof that there is no god?
[11:48] <I-merican> I want a kiwi.
[11:48] <Shrub74> Shadaez don't fall for it
[11:48] <zelda> atheism is without religion
[11:48] <I-merican> That sits on my shoulder.
[11:48] <Bearodactyl> you're just believing there isn't
[11:48] <Shrub74> he's just luring
[11:48] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl what are the root words for athiesm
[11:48] <Bearodactyl> actually, it's without gods
[11:48] <SumWon> Why am I so bald?
[11:48] <I-merican> And squeaks when I reach over and squeeze it.
[11:49] <Bearodactyl> no god
[11:49] <Brick> ugh, come to Australia and take some of ours.
[11:49] <Bearodactyl> not no religion
[11:49] <zelda> literally its without gods
[11:49] <zelda> which leads to no religion
[11:49] <Bearodactyl> theo means god
[11:49] <Brick> There are too many Kiwis here bru.
[11:49] <Bearodactyl> or diety
[11:49] <zelda> religion is belief in a diety
[11:49] <I-merican> "Check out my happenin' Hoop'Tea..."
[11:49] <Dark207> there are kiwis here?
[11:49] <zelda> lack of diety = no religion
[11:49] <I-merican> *Squeak*
[11:49] <Bearodactyl> it doesn't mean no religion, and religion is not belief in a diety
[11:49] <Dark207> I haven't seen a kiwi before in my life?
[11:49] <Bearodactyl> a lot of religions believe in dieties, but not all
[11:49] <zelda> what religion doesn't
[11:49] <SumWon> Oh god, are you arguing about wether or not atheism is a religion or not? You cannot win this debate....
[11:49] <Bearodactyl> and still, to think all religions are false is a religion within itself

[11:50] <Bearodactyl> you BELIEVE there is no god, because there isn't proof that there isn't
[11:50] <Bearodactyl> Hinduism might be 100% the truth
[11:50] <I-merican> How can there be too many Kiwi birds?
[11:50] <Brick> Stop, wait a second everybody.
[11:50] <zelda> are double doors possible with double pressure pads right in front of them

[11:51] <I-merican> Oh man, I think we have.
[11:51] <Brick> We'd be completely fucked, wouldn't we.
[11:51] <Bearodactyl> being atheist denies that that is possible
[11:51] <Bearodactyl> when it is entirely possible
[11:51] <Dark207> Atheism hasn't a distinct meaning
[11:51] <Dark207> there's no point making an argument
[11:51] <Bearodactyl> what is atheism?
[11:51] <Bearodactyl> the denial of religion?
[11:51] <Dark207> The denial of gods
[11:51] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl so you hate obama and you're catholic?
[11:51] <Dark207> or a god

[11:52] <Shadaez> I was making fun of you

[11:52] <Bearodactyl> and I am not a catholic or even christian for that matter

[11:53] <sorre> glenn beck's television show is a pretty massive waste of time

[11:53] <ranger10700> buhbuhbuhbuhbuh
[11:53] <ranger10700> hi
[11:53] <Bearodactyl> or "denial of religion"
[11:53] <Dark207> Because I believe if human ever finds the answer to any of the questions it may somehow be used to ruin life in some way
[11:53] <Shrub74> Glenn Beck?
[11:53] <Brick> give me one way in which our life would be improved by knowing how the earth was created.
[11:53] <Brick> Just one.
[11:53] <I-merican> Stephen Colbert is worried that Glenn Beck's organs are being taken over by terrorists.
[11:53] <Bearodactyl> is a religion within itself, because there is no proof that catholocism isn't true
[11:54] <I-merican> I share that worry.
[11:54] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl what's your favourite hobby
[11:54] <Dark207> If a full set of evidence were found against one side
[11:54] <sorre> organs?
[11:54] <Dark207> like
[11:54] <Dark207> completely true undeniable evidence
[11:54] <Bearodactyl> hobby? probably walking or playing music
[11:54] <sorre> far as i'm concerned, glenn beck is a single, gigantic organ
[11:54] <sorre> if you know what i mean
[11:54] <Dark207> then people would either go crazy or some other shit
[11:54] <Bearodactyl> or both simueltaneously
[11:54] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl is not playing music a hobby, too?
[11:54] <I-merican> Hah-hah-hah.
[11:54] <Bearodactyl> if everyone played music
[11:54] <Bearodactyl> it would be
[11:54] <Brick> Nobody would listen to it.
[11:54] <Shadaez> no.. not really...
[11:55] <Bearodactyl> however, this is a logical fallacy you're trying to pull here
[11:55] <Shadaez> which one would that be?
[11:55] <I-merican> I think if everyone would played music would be a lot better.
[11:55] <Bearodactyl> as hobbies aren't religion, though your hobby could be religiously related

[12:01] <SumWon> Because I saw it NOT ruling the universe.
[12:01] <Bearodactyl> you saw it?
[12:01] <SumWon> Yes
[12:01] <Bearodactyl> did you take a picture?
[12:01] <Plinky> Can someone do a job for me?
[12:01] <SumWon> But it told me it wasn't ruling the universe
[12:01] <sorre> every time we explain a natural process that we previously believed that a deity was responsible for, the religious community says "Well... uhh... Maybe God did THAT!"
[12:01] <SumWon> It was just passing on to page 10
[12:01] <Brick> Oh god, it never stops
[12:01] <Obtuse_goose> My hypothesis: IF PEOPLE SHUT UP ABOUT DUMB THINGS, THEN WE WILL BE HAPPY, BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T BEING DUMB
[12:02] <Bearodactyl> and you believed it? I thought you didn't believe in dieties

[12:02] <Plinky> I need someone to tell Animator to remove my thread when he comes on.
[12:02] <SumWon> uuh, no. I believe neither of us is cornered as we are both full of shit.
[12:02] <Shadaez> Bearodactyl are you ignoring me now :(

[12:17] <Bearodactyl> why would I be banned?
[12:17] <Tukiko> Lol no, but hi! :)
[12:17] <Bearodactyl> I'm too cool for school, let alone banning
[12:17] <vede> Notch has to take extra time to make them secret.
[12:17] <vede> If they weren't secret things would go way faster.
[12:18] <Tukiko> vede: He has to use brackets when he types [SECRET STUFF]
[12:18] <Visiiri> Initially, it would be a little rude to ban you. "General Stupidity" is a nice reason.
[12:18] <Obtuse_goose> herp derp

[12:22] <Tukiko> Poikachoika: No. Wat?
[12:22] <Poikachoika> like IRC, i'm also not very used to streaming; i thought you were testing the SMP and streaming it
[12:23] <SumWon> Anyway, who will be the first to make a basic computer with red stuff? Yo dawg, I herd you like computers, herpa derpa

[12:23] <Poikachoika> lol how would the computer operate sum?
[12:23] <Poikachoika> like, what would it achieve?
[12:23] <Bearodactyl> honestly failing by one point's a compliment, but you're probably too uneducated to know that

[12:24] <Tukiko> And you're too uneducated to realize that IQ is not an accurate measurement of anything.
[12:24] <SumWon> Not that that would be possible atm
[12:24] <Poikachoika> there's really only a couple of forms of I/O
[12:24] <Bearodactyl> it isn't, the MENSA test is crap
[12:24] <Tukiko> But I'm not going to get in an argument on that.

[13:34] <Poikachoika> oh lol
[13:34] <Shisno> and in the month you have
[13:35] <Shisno> we go through and level to 60 twice.
[13:35] <Bearodactyl> well I haven't played RS in months XD
[13:35] <Shisno> then you grant a level a third character to me 60 now.
[13:35] <Poikachoika> though if you get a guild and they depend on you

[13:36] <Bearodactyl> and not fun
[13:36] <Poikachoika> lol if you got to 60-70 there are still raids to do (though most people only raid often at 80) and if you get to 80, you either spend all day doing dailies, raids, or pvp
[13:36] <Shisno> Grumb,
[13:36] <Grumb> Shisno
[13:36] <Shisno> would you be willing to make a new set of characters?

[13:36] <Poikachoika> oh wait, i thought you meant wow
[13:36] <Shisno> At least two,
[13:36] <AzKay> Then I stuck with Ragnarok
[13:36] <Grumb> For what reason
[13:37] <Shisno> but im fine with having about 5 or 6 :)
[13:37] <Shisno> for leveling to 60.

[13:37] <Grumb> Ahaha, RAF?
[13:37] <Shisno> Yep.
[13:37] <Poikachoika> haha azkay, to get properly addicted to wow, you need to start with a friend and make it to level 12 or so
[13:37] <Bearodactyl> I played on small servers of RO
[13:37] <Shisno> I want to get as many 60s as I can
[13:37] <Poikachoika> and then you will be addicted
[13:37] <Bearodactyl> was really weird
[13:37] <Bearodactyl> fun for awhile
[13:37] <Poikachoika> anyone ever play eve?
[13:37] <Grumb> Hmm, I've already RAF'd someone, I'm not sure if I'd be able to do it again, can you?
[13:37] <AzKay> I played on a private server because I think its stupid having to pay a monthly fee to play a game.
[13:37] <Shisno> I mean...

[13:38] <Poikachoika> they have so many servers
[13:38] <Shisno> tis the money that has turned any of my friends off
[13:38] <Grumb> Mmm.
[13:38] <Grumb> If I did so, I'd cancel my other account for the time being.
[13:38] <Grumb> I pay through Credit Card so...
[13:38] <Shisno> if you'd like to do that,
[13:38] <Poikachoika> so, i take it no one has played eve?
[13:38] <Shrub74> D:<

[14:18] <Euphoriant> Notch added a portal gun!
[14:18] <Poikachoika> lol
[14:18] <LG_Legacy> And then VurtualRuler98 bitched at me for it. Anyways, Poikachoika that sounds fun.

[14:18] <AzKay> I wish EA brought out a new awesome patch for Red Alert 2 instead of making Red Alert 3
[14:18] <Poikachoika> you have to dig out every single block
[14:19] <AzKay> RA3 was just terribad
[14:19] <rcfighter> Willing to bet it involves Alt + F4
[14:19] <Poikachoika> in the whole map
[14:19] <Poikachoika> and then you'll get it
[14:19] <Quatroking> RA3 is lovely for langaming

[14:19] <Quatroking> assboring on singleplayer
[14:19] <AzKay> Yeah
[14:19] <Poikachoika> serious sam is the best
[14:19] <Quatroking> fucking hilarious when playing on lam
[14:19] <Quatroking> lan*
[14:19] <LG_Legacy> Hey don't talk shit about Warcraft.
[14:19] <AzKay> At least RA2 was fun in singleplayer, well was for me
[14:19] <LG_Legacy> >_>
[14:19] <Quatroking> co-op campaign mode is fucking hilarious :D
[14:19] <Poikachoika> warcraft is also the best
[14:19] <Poikachoika> lol
[14:20] <Quatroking> warcraft is amazing
[14:20] <Euphoriant> Tides of Darkness is the best Warcraft in the franchise
[14:20] <Quatroking> "world of warcraft" aint warcraft
[14:20] <Poikachoika> yeah i know lol
[14:20] <LG_Legacy> I still got my tides of darkness book.
[14:20] <rcfighter> Expecially the first one. The only thing that ruined the future Warcraft games for me was the unit limit.

[14:21] <AzKay> ;o
[14:22] <Poikachoika> penguins will be as strong as bears
[14:22] <Poikachoika> :(
[14:22] <rcfighter> Penguins can be picked up and used as darts.
[14:22] <Poikachoika> lol
[14:22] <AzKay> Penguins can have bear mechsuits
[14:22] <rcfighter> You have to whack them first, to make them stop moving.
[14:22] <Euphoriant> Maaaan, the car page should have never been taken down
[14:22] <Poikachoika> so that bug that was on my screen being a bro; he's still being a bro on my screen
[14:22] <Poikachoika> never blinking, never moving
[14:22] <Shrub> Rust your bullets with his tears
[14:22] <rcfighter> After you throw them, they eventually get back up and start waddling again.
[14:23] <AzKay> So I put a bro in ur bro so when you watch bro you see bro
[14:23] <Shrub> maybe it's dead
[14:23] <AzKay> I did it wrong, baww.

[17:20] <Nihil> http://imgur.com/C8dD0.png huh, slight bug
[17:20] <Wildstyle> having a bow, arrows, lava pit, cactuss traps, mines , etc
[17:20] <Shrub> i think mobs should be auto-inclined to step on switches
[17:20] <Learner> oh thats true
[17:20] <Fordlover89> Oh come on
[17:20] <Fordlover89> you set me up for that
[17:20] <Learner> But having cacti is good enough.
[17:20] <Learner> What about obsidium walls?
[17:21] <Nihil> Shrub: that'd be fun, making a giant path of useless pressure plates that they'd just follow indefinitely
[17:21] <LF> Nihil it's been like that with the sand
[17:21] <LF> place a block next to it
[17:21] <Learner> lol
[17:21] <LF> It'll fall
[17:21] <Learner> lol again
[17:21] <Learner> so place a pressure place in the middle of some floating sand
[17:22] <Learner> and below that sand is layers of lava
[17:22] <Learner> you know... this reminds me of something
[17:22] <Wildstyle> Before i knew about that sand stuff
[17:22] <asiekierka[afk]> lol
[17:22] <Wildstyle> I went into a cave
[17:22] <Wildstyle> and saw sand above me
[17:22] <Wildstyle> i dug at the edge of it
[17:22] <Wildstyle> ...i died under 5 layers of sand
[17:22] <Wildstyle> V_V
[17:22] <ForeverSilent> hehe
[17:22] <Learner> I dug all the way to the bottom and eventually found a hole going through the map.
[17:23] <Learner> I also found 7 diamonds

[17:23] <ForeverSilent> geez, I don't know about you, but I've dug down deep enough to need 48 ladders and didn't hit bottom
[17:23] <Orris> specially oceans
[17:23] <Learner> I also mined some obsidium using a diamond pickaxe
[17:23] <Wildstyle> I don't go underwater much anymore
[17:23] <Orris> you can touch ground in the deepest oceans
[17:24] <Wildstyle> no point IMO
[17:24] <Learner> I have about 35-40
[17:24] <Orris> not yet anyways
[17:24] <Rautapalli> oh cool, there are snowy and normal areas mixed together now?
[17:24] <ForeverSilent> nice
[17:24] <Learner> Obsidium? Actually obsidium is probrably the best defence material
[17:24] <ForeverSilent> I had to start over last night, we had a power outage while i was playing MC, and when the power came back up, I had no world anymore... :'(
[17:24] <Wildstyle> Im thinking of making a Cactuss castle
[17:24] <Learner> To make a truly defencive base... add a roof perhaps?
[17:25] <Learner> good idea wild
[17:25] <Wildstyle> even if they break a block
[17:25] <Learner> but... you might need some food to do something like that
[17:25] <Wildstyle> if you lay the floor in cactuss
[17:25] <ForeverSilent> If theres a way to Backup World's I'd love to hear it
[17:25] <Wildstyle> they will always get hurt
[17:25] <Cial> can you plant cacti?

[17:30] <Learner> has anyone seen the python code?

[17:30] <Nihil> python code for what?
[17:30] <Learner> that allows you to add giant trees?

[18:19] <Arsonide> it hurts a bit
[18:19] <Darkebrz> Why did Notch have to screw up trees again? This really makes me sad, and it makes me want to go back to indev every time he does it.
[18:19] <Arsonide> but you can do it
[18:19] <TheCactusman> yeah
[18:19] <Learner> also
[18:19] <Learner> I cut down the super tree
[18:19] <Phearo> I just lagged on one of my saves
[18:19] <TheCactusman> You can move them like that
[18:19] <Learner> and got 30 logs from it
[18:19] <chrbarrol> It's just the alpha though
[18:19] <Phearo> Doesn't happen on other saves though
[18:19] <C418> ...screw up?
[18:19] <C418> seriously
[18:20] <Learner> from 1 super tree
[18:20] <Learner> I get 30 logs
[18:20] <Phearo> At first it's fast, then it totally slows down
[18:20] <Darkebrz> The tree leaves, they don't self delete.
[18:20] <Iguana> I believe that's the point

[18:29] <Visiiri> no hurt

[18:30] <Phearo> EXCEPT FOR ME, ALFREDO THE GREAT THIEF
[18:30] <Visiiri> Kokopure: that'd only take like five hearts
[18:30] <lenox> i have some pretty good cactus skins
[18:30] <lenox> since my username is cactusfriend
[18:30] <Learner> most people would probrably try to rob an easy target
[18:30] <lenox> hm
[18:31] <Makke> Shrub, are you the same guy i know on steam
[18:31] <Logon> Snow should drop more snowballs

[18:31] <Learner> TNT placed in a minecart
[18:31] <Phearo> SO much win
[18:32] <Shrub> Bomb carts...
[18:32] <Iguana> I bet 75% of the people ehre have Minecraft

[18:32] <Visiiri> eeeeeooowwwwmmmm BOOSH
[18:32] <Arsonide> I noticed if you stand still on top of cactus it doesn't continue to hurt you. Would not make a good trap unless you made several layers of cactus that a person would need to dig through.
[18:32] <Learner> I had to dig to find my first cave
[18:32] <Makke> Im thinking about buying it. But i dont got the cash for it
[18:32] <Makke> credits?
[18:32] <Learner> Eventually I found lava and decided to dig for it!
[18:32] <Phearo> Annoy someone until they give up
[18:32] <Makke> What are online money called?..
[18:32] <Iguana> Don't have the cash, or can't use a credit card?
[18:33] <Phearo> Paypal
[18:33] <Makke> Yeah i dont have the online money
[18:33] <Iguana> Because if you live in NA, you can buy pre-paid credit cards
[18:33] <Learner> and whammo I find the biggest cave it seems.
[18:33] <Makke> I live in Sweden
[18:33] <epaGamer> Makke steal the cash, minecraft is worth it

[18:40] <ez> it's one of my fav ways to pass the time

[18:43] <Iguana> But oddly, it isn't my favourite game of all time

[18:46] <Iguana> Maybe it's just like leather, with some cactus on it
[18:46] <wolf_alex> nihil same as other armor but with flames
[18:46] <Iguana> Visiiri, nothing in this game is realistic

[19:35] <ForeverSilent> nice!
[19:35] <rybec> Looking through the blog comments, it appears as though the latest version of the client has some basic MP stuff in it. The death bug is because it keep re-inserting the player as a NEW player, and the playercount skyrockets.
[19:36] <gordenfreechmen> raquzzic: they only spawn grass
[19:36] <ForeverSilent> and no refreeze?
[19:36] <Learner> and prevents everything 5 block away from refreezing
[19:36] <Learner> At least
[19:36] <ForeverSilent> nice
[19:36] <Learner> it could be even higher
[19:36] <ForeverSilent> so mega torch
[19:36] <Learner> I used a log and a flame
[19:36] <ForeverSilent> did it demolish your igloo?
[19:36] <Learner> ... I didn't try it on my igloo
[19:36] <Arsonide> What would be the reason for going underwater? If Notch added sea monsters he would probably add encouragement to explore the seabed.
[19:36] <raquzzic> okay... so that means no free pork in caves anymore...
[19:36] <Learner> I tried it on normal ice
[19:36] <ForeverSilent> probably wise then
[19:36] <Arsonide> Please don't say sponge tiles. That's such a sandbox thing.

[20:07] <SeanNanoware> Pigs need to transform to creepers at night.
[20:07] <gordenfreechmen> pigs + toxic goo (new liquid block) = creeper
[20:07] <Whiskerz> Pigs are my gods
[20:07] <Hamby> werepigs!
[20:07] <ForeverSilent> Sean - no... no theey don't *shutter*
[20:07] <So_Useless> Wild boars would be nice, though. A mob that makes pig noises, so you think you're safe... then BAM! Tusk through the face.
[20:08] <SeanNanoware> If it's possible via server side it will be in with me bwahahaha!
[20:08] <Dopefish_lives> Any information on where to find cacti? Do they grow on sand?
[20:08] <SeanNanoware> Yea
[20:08] <So_Useless> They are supposed to. I never found any.
[20:08] <So_Useless> Maybe I'm just unlucky.
[20:08] <ZzZGuy> Question: Can you save your progress in a map and share it with someone else who can then share with you what alterations they did to that map?
[20:08] <LG_Legacy> Welp
[20:08] <ForeverSilent> Only on Sand, if you're in a map you loaded from before, yu ahve to walk about 300 blocks to a new Biodome for the cacti
[20:08] <LG_Legacy> Fixed the problem, got a new problem.
[20:08] <SeanNanoware> You find them on sand. I've only found two or three but I tend to stay inland.

[20:09] <gordenfreechmen> nope
[20:09] <Whiskerz> Not any longer
[20:09] <ZzZGuy> ahh
[20:09] <ZzZGuy> Would be neat to set up your own mob spawns.
[20:10] <ZzZGuy> Right over a lava pit too.
[20:10] <So_Useless> Especially if they could be switch activated.
[20:10] <So_Useless> Set the most fun trap.
[20:10] <So_Useless> Creeper trap.

[20:10] <ForeverSilent> see, this is why I play peaceful
[20:10] <Deages> :(
[20:10] <SeanNanoware> Cowered.
[20:11] <Whiskerz> Creepers are fun
[20:11] <Shrub> Creepers are cute
[20:11] <So_Useless> I switched to peaceful after the mob spawn bug filled a cave of mine with a city of mobs. I don't like it.
[20:11] <Whiskerz> Creepers are the best designed enemy ever
[20:11] <ForeverSilent> but mostly I play peaceful so my 3 kids can play too, without dying constnatly
[20:11] <So_Useless> The threat of monsters provides incentive to build bigger, better stuff.
[20:12] <ForeverSilent> my wife called me about the boats this morning, said my 5yo discovered boats while crafting this morning, and got a grin about a mile wide on his face
[20:13] <ForeverSilent> but I don't need monsters to encourage my buildings Useless.... I'm always building bigger and better, deeper, higher, last night I stayed up until about 1 making an underground lair complete with stone pillars, water wells, etc.... sooo fun
[20:13] <So_Useless> Imagine if notch had decided on a polyhedron other than cubes.
[20:13] <ForeverSilent> :(
[20:13] <gordenfreechmen> notch needs to add swinging animations now

[20:14] <Kokopure> Whiskerz, old new trees are the best

[22:02] <Visiiri> Majestic_XII: You need a stone pickaxe to mine iron.
[22:02] <Axaj> wood doesn't drop iron
[22:02] <SakuyaIzayoi> You need a stone pickaxe or better
[22:02] <Majestic_XII> Oh right...
[22:02] <Visiiri> I have a gravel pickaxe :D
[22:02] <Majestic_XII> thanks for the info
[22:02] <TheCactusman> What?
[22:03] <underd0g> Same goes for diamond. You need an iron pickaxe I think..

[22:09] <VurtualRuler98> yeah, but hey, look at ours
[22:09] <VurtualRuler98> more divisors
[22:09] <VurtualRuler98> makes math easier
[22:09] <SakuyaIzayoi> Fahrenheit 451 just wouldn't have been as cool with a celsius measurement..
[22:09] <VurtualRuler98> 12 inches? You can divide twelve, one, four, six, three, two

[22:10] <VurtualRuler98> You're briiitiiish

[22:10] <Whiskerz> how so?
[22:10] <Zaneo> nah, just naming some weird units
[22:10] <Whiskerz> It makes the most real life sense to me
[22:10] <Zaneo> all the cook kids use K
[22:10] <VurtualRuler98> and F is so hillariously arbitrary for water temperatures
[22:10] <VurtualRuler98> that it makes me feel better

[22:10] <VurtualRuler98> when aliens come
[22:10] <Whiskerz> :P
[22:11] <VurtualRuler98> no, all the cool kids use that kelvin-like measurement system that uses F instead of C
[22:11] <TheCactusman> It's me, sorry sakuya.

[22:38] <Koakuma> Before she starts to die without her shot
[22:38] <Deages> yaaaaay

[22:46] <AzureAngelic> im trying to make a lighthouse
[22:46] <Flot> I remember when he was streaming on brocraft, there were only 200 people watching at first
[22:46] <Fordlover89> it would be like brocraft all over again
[22:46] <Azure|AFK> use lava
[22:46] <Flot> He announced it on twitter that he was, 1.3K people.
[22:46] * Azure|AFK is now known as Azure
[22:46] <Fordlover89> lol
[22:46] <AzureAngelic> yeah thats what i figured i had to do
[22:46] <Azure> :P
[22:46] <Kamila> AzureAngelic: i will use red torch
[22:47] <Flot> Also, DAMNIT NOTCH TILE TICKING.
[22:47] <Flot> Trees don't lose leaves again.
[22:47] <AzureAngelic> i noticed
[22:47] <AzureAngelic> time to burn them all down~
[22:47] <Kamila> now, i need to burn the tree instead
[22:47] <Allo1010> no the leaves are on rebellion
[22:47] <TotempaaltJ> Trees are ugly.
[22:47] <Allo1010> they dont need wood
[22:47] <TotempaaltJ> The new trees.
[22:47] <Allo1010> they can go without it!
[22:47] <Kamila> i like to make a tree house from trees
[22:47] <TotempaaltJ> They can also totally ignore gravity!
[22:47] <TotempaaltJ> :P
[22:47] <Flot> What's the use of megacool trees if they make these anti-immersive floating tufts of leaf!
[22:47] <TotempaaltJ> Just as earth, stone, and most of the other blocks.
[22:47] <TotempaaltJ> Oh, and water.
[22:48] <Flot> Also, I see that the desert biome is coming next.
[22:48] <Flot> Cacti!
[22:48] * sllide is setting up a livestrea
[22:49] <sllide> dunno what to use it for tho..
[22:49] <Flot> Weird how they spawn on beaches instead of... you know, actual desert.
[22:49] <TotempaaltJ> Cacti ftw.
[22:49] <Allo1010> use cactus for traps
[22:49] <Allo1010> you can put it in the ground
[22:49] <Allo1010> monsters walk over it
[22:49] <Allo1010> voila
[22:49] <sllide> walking on them kills you?
[22:49] <Allo1010> yup
[22:49] * sllide didnt notice that
[22:49] * EmpiresBane hasn't seen them...
[22:49] <Flot> Haha, reminds me of those ground spikes from Plants Versus Zombies.
[22:49] <Kamila> i can has wall of cactus?
[22:49] <TheCactusman> walking on snow ONTOP of cacti hurts you
[22:49] <Dysgalt> lol I made one of those
[22:50] <Whiskerz> does walking on cacti hurt mobs?
[22:50] <EmpiresBane> can you move it?
[22:50] <Dysgalt> I died 9 times while making the great cacti wall
[22:50] <underd0g> Cactusman is an EXPERT on cacti
[22:50] <Flot> Well yeah. Frosty cacti is still cacti.

[22:50] <Allo1010> btw guys use flint to get rid of the trees
[22:50] <TheCactusman> Cacti IS flammable
[22:50] <TheCactusman> I think
[22:50] <Whiskerz> Flot: no
[22:50] <Whiskerz> itll burn as long as dirt ya know
[22:50] <Whiskerz> then go out
[22:50] <TheCactusman> It's happened to me alot, so I think cacti are flammable.
[22:50] <Whiskerz> wont actually break
[22:51] <Flot> Does it have a distinctive sound?
[22:51] <Whiskerz> IDK, i dont play with sounds
[22:51] <TheCactusman> see what I did there?
[22:51] <Flot> Cacti are hard with a juicy center, you would think it does!

[23:10] <VurtualRuler98> snow being random

[23:11] <VurtualRuler98> or closer to a snowier area
[23:11] <Bodie> because theres no limit to how far north you are
[23:11] <Allo1010> maybe the higher up you are
[23:11] <tj505050> whats with not having powerred minecarts

[23:14] <Allo1010> uhm

[23:14] <VurtualRuler98> like, set your game to be open to some degree, in SP
[23:14] <Allo1010> not in alpha mate
[23:14] <VurtualRuler98> and people cna join in
[23:14] <Bodie> so... like multiplayer?
[23:14] <Bodie> :p
[23:14] <EmpiresBane> join and leave your game?
[23:14] <VurtualRuler98> yeah, but you host from sp directly
[23:14] <Bodie> more like MMO
[23:14] <VurtualRuler98> and you could set it so your friends could come in
[23:14] <Bodie> so everyone thats playing

[23:15] <Bodie> thats how it'll be Allo1010

[23:15] <VurtualRuler98> mc isn't going to be an mmo
[23:15] <Flot> Allo, notch said that there would be massive problems with more than just a few players playing on an infinite server at once. 120 people on an infinite server is pretty much impossible.
[23:15] <Allo1010> you never know
[23:16] <VurtualRuler98> but being able to host a simple server off of the client directly would be awesome
[23:16] <VurtualRuler98> say, like, how lots of other games have done.
[23:16] <VurtualRuler98> good ones
[23:16] <TheMilkMan> Lolol people spreading out in 120 directions xD
[23:16] <VurtualRuler98> Flot, there's no limit to maxplayers now
[23:16] <l2623113> maybe being able to make your SP maps MP
[23:16] <Gunmage> Are you implying coconuts migrate?
[23:16] <TheMilkMan> Walking for 2 miles, that'll crash the server xD
[23:16] <VurtualRuler98> 8585858/1000000 may be possible

[23:16] <Eagle> Gunmage, I don't know, maybe a bird carried it
[23:17] <Allo1010> How?
[23:17] <l2623113> maybe u were the bird eagle
[23:17] <Eagle> Maybe I was
[23:17] <Axaj> maybe it's an albatross
[23:17] <l2623113> mebeh
[23:17] <Allo1010> A bird cant carry a cocnut it wouldnt be able to fly!
[23:17] <Gunmage> boats break if you run into something?
[23:17] <Allo1010> gunmage thats a glitch, apparently
[23:17] <l2623113> yeah
[23:17] <TheMilkMan> Boats break if you tap them...
[23:17] <Gunmage> Maybe it was an african swallow
[23:17] <l2623113> poke [BOOM]
[23:17] <Flot> A glitch?
[23:17] <Allo1010> yeah
[23:17] <Bodie> i doubt it
[23:18] <Bodie> maybe
[23:18] <Bodie> who knows
[23:18] <Flot> If you ram into something on a boat made of wood IRL, wouldn't it break?
[23:18] <Allo1010> well a sheep can destroy a boat
[23:18] <l2623113> depends on how fast
[23:18] * TkTech|TF2 is now known as TkTech
[23:18] <Gunmage> Still though, boats
[23:18] <l2623113> tand how hard the surface
[23:18] <TheMilkMan> Not if you t ap it though.
[23:18] <Gunmage> We actually have transportation now
[23:18] <Bodie> boats are pretty fast
[23:18] <Allo1010> and you cant dock the boat
[23:18] <VurtualRuler98> I dunno if it's lack of detail or what
[23:18] <l2623113> you can dock boats

[23:18] <Gunmage> Just sad that I have a pretty bitchin ice map going and cant really use them >_>
[23:18] <VurtualRuler98> but I'm getting 40-50FPS in my little map with 4x AA

[23:18] <Allo1010> Gunmage make a new one
[23:18] <Allo1010> i did
[23:18] <l2623113> im getting 10 FPS
[23:19] <Gunmage> I know but I like the snow theme much more.
[23:19] <l2623113> usually i have around 30FPS
[23:19] <l2623113> snow maps arent even playable
[23:19] <l2623113> for me
[23:19] <Allo1010> Being able to get snowed in in those maps would be awesome.

[23:20] <l2623113> ITS A TRAP!
[23:20] <Gunmage> I will make a new map I suppose
[23:20] <Allo1010> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooo
[23:20] <Gunmage> I wish it was a trap
[23:20] <Jesse> Guys, when was the multiplayer button added to the alpha client? Someone I know is insisting it was added in this update.
[23:20] <Gunmage> Better than cleaning up dog crap.
[23:20] <l2623113> it is
[23:20] <l2623113> dog crap?
[23:20] <Allo1010> Jesse it was there when the client came out

[23:27] <VurtualRuler98> cave music http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYi3qT1rQzA

[23:27] <Tarvis> It's got to have the Theme for the menu too
[23:28] <Keralastic> You have to get the snow off first

[23:29] <Keralastic> They're working on Doom 4, silly
[23:29] <Bodie> doom was a letdown
[23:29] <Bodie> :(
[23:29] <VurtualRuler98> yeah we call it quake 2
[23:29] <VurtualRuler98> not that quite sequelly
[23:29] <Tarvis> they're going to show it in Quakecon I think
[23:29] <Bodie> the engine was cool, but the game was a little predictable
[23:29] <l2623113> doom 2 was kinda meh
[23:29] <Keralastic> Quake 2 isn't a sequel to the first Quake

[23:32] <Jat> then play it a lower difficulty level
[23:32] <VurtualRuler98> It had a bunker gun
[23:32] <VurtualRuler98> you had just reached the end of a track
[23:32] <Whiskerz> I found half life hard because i didnt want to play it, hard to keep on
[23:32] <VurtualRuler98> to continue, you had to hit a switch or something
[23:32] <VurtualRuler98> there were soldiers behind raised crates

[23:32] <VurtualRuler98> Every time I got there, I had only a few hp

[23:33] <VurtualRuler98> on the topic of half-life 2
[23:33] <Keralastic> Is that you were constantly stuck with low HP because the medkits are few, and the few you find aren't very effective
[23:33] <l2623113> pardon my russian
[23:33] <Keralastic> Especially if you played on hard
[23:33] <l2623113> i say tht instead of pardon my french

[23:33] <Jat> long ago
[23:34] <Keralastic> I made the mistake of playing Opposing Force on hard after beating the original
[23:34] <Keralastic> Headcrabs did like, 20 damage per attack
[23:34] <l2623113> dumbass XD

[23:34] <underd0g> Any survival streams up?
[23:34] <Keralastic> And healthkits only healed 15HP
[23:34] <geraldbrent> which should i get gmod or L4
[23:34] <Axaj> gmod
[23:34] <geraldbrent> dead 2
[23:34] <Axaj> definately
[23:34] <l2623113> opposing forces was one of the hardest Valve games ever
[23:34] <Jat> something that really bothers me about halflife is that for some reason running out of oxygen underwater decreases your health instead of an oxygen meter or something
[23:34] <geraldbrent> i see i will
[23:34] <Keralastic> I can get up a survival stream later today
[23:34] <VurtualRuler98> l4d2 sucks
[23:34] <VurtualRuler98> don't get it
[23:35] <VurtualRuler98> the first is much more fun somehow
[23:35] <Keralastic> The first one's better, but that's not saying much
[23:35] <VurtualRuler98> "opposing forces"?
[23:35] <VurtualRuler98> Firstly, "opposing force"
[23:35] <VurtualRuler98> and it wasn't even valve-made
[23:35] <Keralastic> I SAID Opposing Force
[23:35] <underd0g> Vurtual, I agree. L4D is way better than the sequel
[23:35] <Keralastic> It was made by Gearbox, yes
[23:35] <Koppis> geraldbreant I for one wouldn't recommend gmod, it has no replay value
[23:35] <VurtualRuler98> jat well what happens when it's empty?
[23:35] <VurtualRuler98> that oxygen bar
[23:35] <Keralastic> Both Left 4 Deads are fun

[23:35] <VurtualRuler98> Half-life games always took the concession that you can't visually see how much lung capacity you have
[23:36] <VurtualRuler98> and then you start choking and suffocating and drowning

[23:36] <VurtualRuler98> Keralastic I played the first, a lot.
[23:36] <l2623113> and asphyxiating
[23:36] <Imerican> I thought the whole point of gmod was replay value, koppis.
[23:36] <VurtualRuler98> and... garry's mod has no replay value, koppis?
[23:36] <Jat> i dont actually remember how it works but i still think its stupid that your oxygen level is attached to your health
[23:36] <Keralastic> VurtualRuler98 I played it for a week or so
[23:36] <l2623113> GMOD isnt a proper game
[23:36] <VurtualRuler98> Plenty of people play it often.
[23:36] <l2623113> its a mass mod
[23:36] <Keralastic> Gmod is like a toolset
[23:36] <VurtualRuler98> It's just you
[23:36] <Imerican> that's the point, isn't it?
[23:36] <geraldbrent> i need to get a better graphics card for my laptop
[23:36] <Imerican> It's multiplayer make whatever you want.
[23:36] <Jat> and also i dont know what youre talking about vurtual with not being able to see how much lung capacity you have
[23:37] <Jat> i can tell when im suffocating underwater
[23:37] <l2623113> its always funny Pwning the "pick up that can cop"
[23:37] <VurtualRuler98> well you can tell when it's gone
[23:37] <JoePRIMERIB> if you like minecraft, gmod will entertain you for ages. both l4ds are entertaining the first day or two you play them, then get really boring. plus l4d2s community is awful, so you need a clan to play on a proper server
[23:37] <VurtualRuler98> but before that point, you just get nothing, or in the first you get a warning where your o2 levels are extreemely low
[23:37] <Jat> vurtual halflife does show you how much you have left
[23:37] <VurtualRuler98> hl2 removed the blood o2 warning, but added the ability for aux power to regen your air
[23:37] <Jat> its reflected in your hp as you watch it go down
[23:38] <VurtualRuler98> no, once your air physically runs out, your hp goes down
[23:38] <VurtualRuler98> until you finally drown
[23:38] <Jat> no...

[23:38] <Jat> when you get back to the surface
[23:38] <Imerican> Who cares?
[23:38] <Jat> you see your hp come back
[23:38] <Jat> gradually

[23:38] <VurtualRuler98> and if you dive back in, your hp... doeeesn't move back down until your air runs out again
[23:39] <tj505050> omg i found gold apple in tresure room
[23:39] <VurtualRuler98> maybe it's you starting to strain from holding your breath for too long, unsafely, until your physical will gives out and you reflexively breathe in

[23:39] <Imerican> A...gold apple?
[23:39] <Jat> vurtual stop making stuff up its just a crappy game design decision
[23:39] <VurtualRuler98> but no
[23:39] <geraldbrent> Cop: Pick up that can. You: No!!!! *throws can at cop which then falls in the can* Cop
[23:39] <VurtualRuler98> your air isn't reflected in your hp
[23:39] <Jat> yes it is...
[23:39] <VurtualRuler98> you have a seperate amount of air when swimming
[23:39] <VurtualRuler98> drowning effect only kicks in after a bit
[23:39] <VurtualRuler98> in both hl games
[23:39] <Imerican> Is this really what we're arguing about?
[23:39] <VurtualRuler98> and in ep2, mysteriously, you don't run out of air if you don't have a suit
[23:39] <Jat> yeah but when you get back up to the surface it comes back
[23:40] <VurtualRuler98> that's quake's fault actually
[23:40] <Imerican> What does the golden apple do?
[23:40] <VurtualRuler98> figure out what id was thinking

[23:40] <VurtualRuler98> heal 10hp
[23:40] <VurtualRuler98> you can also use 8 gold ingots(blocks? Who knows) to make a golden apple from a normal, weak one
[23:40] <l2623113> golden apple completly heals health
[23:40] <Imerican> Sounds tasty.

[23:41] <Kizzycocoa> wouldn't that, like, break your teeth?
[23:41] <Axaj> nah
[23:41] <Whiskerz> also vurtual it heals 20hp, as each half heart is 1hp
[23:41] <Keralastic> I wasn't aware the apples were in yet
[23:41] <Axaj> it's just infused with gold
[23:41] <geraldbrent> yay Animator
[23:41] <VurtualRuler98> just call it 10
[23:41] <Whiskerz> k
[23:41] <Whiskerz> :P
[23:41] <VurtualRuler98> and having 2.5 hearts is 2.5hp
[23:41] <Whiskerz> 10 hearts
[23:41] <AndrewPH|School> Animator: you're here!
[23:41] <Whiskerz> i call em hearts anyway so its G
[23:41] <AndrewPH|School> a little too late for me :1

[23:46] <Keralastic> I've explored quite a bit in my boating adventures
[23:46] <Tarvis> ZzZGuy: It doesnt matter where you are really

[23:47] <geraldbrent> vemtrillo is ok but laggs my comp to hell

[23:48] <VurtualRuler98> You know, in the future, if I have some ultra-shiny laboratory like home
[23:48] <Keralastic> Didn't Notch say he just didn't have enough time to put disappearing leaves back in though?

[23:48] <Keralastic> No it is not
[23:48] <Keralastic> Well, for little isolated trees yeah
[23:48] <VurtualRuler98> If all else fails, use fire.

[23:49] <Allo1010> Hey Animator, you watched the mock documentary. out of curiosity did Notch see it?
[23:49] <Keralastic> But otherwise you'd just cause a mess
[23:49] <VurtualRuler98> aaa
[23:49] <Schaap> the burn the mess
[23:49] <Schaap> see
[23:49] <VurtualRuler98> I think I made the VRAD lighting algorithm freak out
[23:49] <Schaap> solution
[23:49] <Tarvis> TNT makes people happy
[23:49] <Keralastic> The mess IS the burning
[23:49] <Tarvis> If fire doesn't work
[23:49] <geraldbrent> hint light the trees near your wooden base on fire
[23:49] <Schaap> then wait

[23:50] <Tarvis> Or you can just do it with players

[23:51] <Keralastic> Or a stack of sand for a bunch of died cloth
[23:51] <Keralastic> Dyed cloth?
[23:51] <ZzZGuy> Any Canadians here?
[23:51] <l2623113> Canada...
[23:51] <Whiskerz> Probably
[23:51] <l2623113> DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUN
[23:51] <Kizzycocoa> if there is landclaim flags, I want a land-claim view
[23:52] <ZzZGuy> Would like to know how the billing worked out.
[23:52] <gdude2002|away> lol, thought Tarvis was Tardis
[23:52] <Tarvis> Then both players put what they want to trade so nobody skimps out, as what would happen if they did it by just dropping stuff
[23:52] <Kizzycocoa> where protected areas are outlined in green, and non-protected in red
[23:52] <l2623113> land claim flags are a crappy idea

[23:52] * Koko|chores is now known as Kokopure

[23:53] <VurtualRuler98> what's going on
[23:53] <VurtualRuler98> this ladder in my map
[23:53] <Tarvis> Let me guess
[23:53] <Tarvis> Water destroyed it?
[23:53] <VurtualRuler98> if I try to climb it, it climbs it automatically
[23:53] <l2623113> i broke your ladder vurtual
[23:53] <VurtualRuler98> no, hl2
[23:53] <Tarvis> oh

[23:53] <VurtualRuler98> ever

[23:53] <l2623113> lol
[23:53] <l2623113> sux2bu
[23:53] <geraldbrent> all you would see is all protected areas and you would have no fun
[23:54] <Whiskerz> I was thinking how Notch will make them work
[23:54] <Whiskerz> like
[23:54] <l2623113> grifer would make indestructible penises everywhere
[23:54] <Keralastic> I'd be cool with it if it just told you that "Hey, this place is owned by this player"
[23:54] <Whiskerz> whats stops me from claiming all
[23:54] <Keralastic> And doing anything would just alert the owner
[23:54] <l2623113> afk i have to go pop a swuat
