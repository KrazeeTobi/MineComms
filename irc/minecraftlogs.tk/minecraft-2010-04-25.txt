[1:02] <whaleboobs> cool.
[1:02] <ExDee> he quit developing, went to go work with activision on modern warfare 84
[1:02] <whaleboobs> Fuck.
[1:02] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[1:02] <Ten_Tacles> <.<
[1:03] <ZarroTsu> development of which is set 36 years ago
[1:03] <ExDee> if you preorder now you save 1% from the full-price, 100$
[1:03] <Ten_Tacles> I just tried to get my first fortress in DF into year 3.
[1:03] <whaleboobs> Ant tips of a game that i can play meanwhile?
[1:03] <whaleboobs> haha lma0

[1:03] <Fenix393> $99 that is insane

[1:03] <ExDee> No it's a great bargin
[1:03] <Fenix393> I know
[1:03] <ExDee> Kodak says so
[1:03] <fenixfurion> here comes the pingfest because of the name "fenix"
[1:03] <whaleboobs> DF has little graphics
[1:03] <ZarroTsu> Modern warefare sucks though
[1:03] <whaleboobs> xD
[1:03] <Ten_Tacles> Its 20 euro after beta
[1:04] <AndrewPH> If anybody here has MCTunnel's source, I need to look through it for some commands
[1:04] <Ten_Tacles> Whale, yes , yes it has.
[1:04] <AzureAngelic> finally hit lava in infdev, can't decide if i should be happy or pissed
[1:04] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[1:04] <ExDee> $26 US for those americans(Like me)
[1:04] <Ten_Tacles> Its teh bottom of the map
[1:04] <Mos> AzureAngelic: it's not really hard
[1:04] <ExDee> $13 with these savings
[1:04] <AzureAngelic> yeah, i built glass over the lava and i can see the sun under it >_>
[1:04] <Yourself> too bad you can't build magma forges like you can in dwarf fortress
[1:04] <Yourself> that'd be pretty badass
[1:04] <AzureAngelic> apparently the world is flat
[1:04] <Mos> yes it is
[1:04] <Ten_Tacles> This laptop is freaking slow
[1:05] <Mos> how did you manage to build glass over the lava?
[1:05] <Mos> i try but can't get it to connect anywhere
[1:05] <AzureAngelic> um
[1:05] <whaleboobs> Would be cool to make minecraft maps with authentic round earth
[1:05] <AzureAngelic> i just put glass on the lava lol
[1:05] <whaleboobs> wouldnt be impossible?
[1:05] <Ten_Tacles> Got attacked by 2 titans, in the second year of my fortress <.<
[1:05] <Mos> yeah how did you put glass on the lava
[1:05] <whaleboobs> Gravity would be hard though
[1:05] <AzureAngelic> i just dug away the stone above it and put glass where it was
[1:05] <Mos> v0v
[1:06] <AzureAngelic> i wasn't aware you shouldn't be able to do that D:
[1:06] <Yourself> gravity isn't the problem with a round world in minecraft
[1:06] <Yourself> the round world part is the problem
[1:06] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[1:06] <Mos> it wouldn't literally be round
[1:06] <Mos> it would just wrap around
[1:06] <Ten_Tacles> That
[1:06] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[1:06] <Yourself> that's different
[1:06] <Mos> but it would make the day/night cycles REALLY weird
[1:07] <Mos> so it will never happen
[1:07] <whaleboobs> Yourself, why? imageinge you remove everything except the last block in the middle. what happens if you go over it? do you fall to the side of it or straight down?
[1:07] <Ten_Tacles> I didn't even had a mayor when they attacked

[1:07] <AzureAngelic> they can if you have enough of them in a low enough resolution!
[1:08] <Yourself> you'll still run into problems at polar regions
[1:08] <Mos> it wouldn't really be a sphere then now would it
[1:08] <AzureAngelic> true D:

[1:11] <AzureAngelic> infdev apparently has no issues with me building an underwater base with no ceiling
[1:11] <Norend> lol same here
[1:11] <Ten_Tacles> Glass never breakes until you remove it.
[1:11] <Mos> infdev's flow physics are broken
[1:11] <Yourself> that's because water physics aren't inyet
[1:11] <AzureAngelic> i figured as much
[1:11] <Ten_Tacles> Azure infdev has no water physics
[1:11] <Yourself> not really broken so much as not implemented presently
[1:11] <Mos> not that indev's flow physics are much better xD
[1:12] <AzureAngelic> well at least indev HAS water physics
[1:12] <Ten_Tacles> Notch will work on them :p
[1:12] <Dman757> kinda
[1:12] <AnonymousDonald> Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeh bored

[1:14] <AzureAngelic> shouldn't it become glass O_o
[1:14] <AzureAngelic> logically speaking anyway
[1:14] <Mos> well
[1:14] <Mos> i tried attaching sand above lava
[1:14] <Mos> and the sand turns into lava without dropping

[1:15] <Fractal> Here is that taken to the extreme, Mos : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVmLOZLaYnE
[1:15] <rbos> that's a lot of blocks
[1:15] <Ten_Tacles> It does not turn into lava
[1:15] <Ten_Tacles> It replaces it.
[1:15] <Mos> Ten_Tacles: i just did it

[1:52] <ZomBuster> what was
[1:52] <Visiiri> Hey, Lord_Aidan.
[1:52] <Visiiri> I just did a four hour livestream
[1:52] <Visiiri> infdev
[1:53] <Lord_Aidan> Lol
[1:53] <ZomBuster> oh nice
[1:53] <Visiiri> Then I fell in the lava
[1:53] <Lord_Aidan> xD
[1:53] <Visiiri> and lost everything.
[1:53] <ZomBuster> haha
[1:53] <Visiiri> >.>
[1:53] <Lord_Aidan> Nicely done.
[1:53] <Visiiri> It wasn't bad, actually.
[1:53] <Lord_Aidan> I do believe tyou can save though.
[1:53] <Visiiri> I had a chest full of stuff, so I can pick up whenever.
[1:53] <Visiiri> But I lost all of my armor.. that's the sour part.
[1:53] <ZomBuster> you can't save, its autosaved
[1:53] <Visiiri> Iron is hard to find.
[1:53] <Lord_Aidan> lol
[1:53] <ClassiestMedic> bbl bye dinner
[1:53] <AzureAngelic> dude, i have at least 128 irons

[1:54] <Visiiri> what is your secret?

[1:57] <Lord_Aidan> my minecraft is messed up
[1:57] <Visiiri> It only needs a 7x7x7 for a tree to grow.

[1:57] <Yourself> what i want is more coal
[1:57] <Yourself> i used up all of mine
[1:57] <Lord_Aidan> It starts spinning all over!
[1:57] <Fractal> the trees don't grow through things in infdev, they just flow around
[1:57] <Lord_Aidan> you can control it at all
[1:57] <Visiiri> Lord_Aidan: Press alt
[1:58] <Lord_Aidan> What does that do?
[1:58] <Fractal> Visiiri: Mine's bigger than yours

[1:59] <Dman757> Have there been any speculation on how many people infdev multiplayer servers could handle?
[2:00] <Fractal> on linux, using xinerama, it will spin unless monitor 1 is right of monitor 0
[2:00] <AzureAngelic> just for kicks im gonna blockstack straight up from my lava chamber to the surface and figure out where i am
[2:00] <Lord_Aidan> I thought of a interesting thing
[2:00] <Lord_Aidan> for survival indev.
[2:01] <shapeshiftr> hey lord aidan
[2:01] <Lord_Aidan> When you get killed... you get banned from the server.
[2:01] <shapeshiftr> no D:
[2:01] <Lord_Aidan> Well, think of it
[2:01] <Jay0> i like that idea
[2:01] <Lord_Aidan> If you have two groups of guys battling
[2:01] <Lord_Aidan> You take casualties
[2:01] <Lord_Aidan> and they cant come on there anymore
[2:01] <shapeshiftr> actually, that's not a bad idea
[2:01] <Lord_Aidan> Of course, the server owner can always unban at their leisure.
[2:01] <shapeshiftr> yeah
[2:01] <Lord_Aidan> So, say with these clans.
[2:01] <Dman757> Temp ban "X" amount of time
[2:01] <shapeshiftr> so after a round, everyone would be unbanned
[2:02] <shapeshiftr> ^^
[2:02] <Lord_Aidan> Say a clan attacks another clans server
[2:02] <Fractal> Lord_Aidan: consider griefers, though, all the time
[2:02] <Lord_Aidan> They kill everyone on it
[2:02] <Lord_Aidan> And take over the server
[2:02] <shapeshiftr> ^^ i like
[2:02] <Lord_Aidan> Im gonna suggest it to Notch
[2:02] <Lord_Aidan> next time I see it.
[2:02] <shapeshiftr> sounds good.
[2:02] <Dman757> Well thats considering the people on the server have no gear or weapons
[2:02] <Lord_Aidan> Maybe a safe zone
[2:02] <Lord_Aidan> around spawn?
[2:02] <shapeshiftr> si
[2:03] <Lord_Aidan> And perhaps only bans you
[2:03] <Lord_Aidan> if killed by another player.
[2:03] <Lord_Aidan> So you can keep on fighting the monsters
[2:03] <shapeshiftr> sounds good, but that would create inconsistencies
[2:03] <Lord_Aidan> Like?
[2:03] <Caleo> I should play indev
[2:04] <shapeshiftr> you die for good when someone else kills you, but you just respawn when a monster kills you?
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> Fractal, what were you saying
[2:04] <Caleo> I only ran it for like a minute a few days ago
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> about griefers?
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> Hmm.. hey, consider this.
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> Lives.
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> When you get killed it uses up a life
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> As you kill monsters, you get a higher score
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> granting you more lives
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> Also, when people join a server

[2:04] <shapeshiftr> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=7225
[2:05] <Lord_Aidan> That way they have a chance of surviving
[2:05] <shapeshiftr> medics could heal during a monster raid
[2:05] <Fractal> well, the griefers could simply kill people, and stop them accessing their favourite things, that they built
[2:05] <shapeshiftr> how?
[2:05] <Lord_Aidan> Yeah
[2:05] <Lord_Aidan> But you fight them off
[2:05] <Lord_Aidan> Kill the griefer
[2:05] <Mirtrius> I would just make an underground base/creeper farm and tnt everybody elses stuff
[2:05] <shapeshiftr> monsters don't target anyone in particular
[2:05] <Lord_Aidan> Most griefers wouldnt take the tine
[2:05] <Lord_Aidan> *time
[2:05] <Lord_Aidan> to get all buffed up.
[2:05] <Mirtrius> My base would have a secret entrance
[2:05] <Lord_Aidan> What I want to see it a way
[2:06] <shapeshiftr> so you could keep your medics safe, healing eveyone.
[2:06] <Dman757> Yeah but the way I see it is griefers wouldn't be able to do something to a armored individual unless they bum rushed them. Or they would have to spend time making weapons
[2:06] <Lord_Aidan> to destroy pillar jumping in indev
[2:06] * SMP|MW2 is now known as SMP
[2:06] <Lord_Aidan> That way, walls would be useful
[2:06] <shapeshiftr> but during a PvP raid, good strategy would be to target the medics
[2:06] <Lord_Aidan> Yeah,
[2:06] <Mirtrius> You know how pillar jumping can be stopped?
[2:06] <Mirtrius> bow and arrow
[2:06] <Lord_Aidan> A team could work like this:
[2:06] <Mirtrius> shoot them off and watch them die
[2:06] <Lord_Aidan> A medic with bowls of soup
[2:06] <Lord_Aidan> bread and bacon
[2:06] <Lord_Aidan> a couple of guys in armor with swords
[2:06] <AzureAngelic> hah
[2:06] <shapeshiftr> archers with windows.
[2:06] <Lord_Aidan> And a archer of two to support them from behind
[2:06] <AzureAngelic> made it all the way up
[2:07] <shapeshiftr> good idea

[2:07] <Lord_Aidan> Hmm, I think Ill go make a topic
[2:07] <Eztuzt> Mind helping a little odl Eztuzt?
[2:07] <Lord_Aidan> about my death idea
[2:07] <Fractal> pillar jumping is easily solved. the problem is keeping stairs working
[2:07] <Dman757> I still see tunnel ambush as a very good possibility
[2:07] <Lord_Aidan> Yeah, sapping?
[2:07] <Eztuzt> Alright, thanks everyone
[2:07] <Lord_Aidan> What would be cool
[2:07] <Lord_Aidan> Is falling blocks.
[2:07] <Eztuzt> Now
[2:08] <Lord_Aidan> So you tunnel your way under a castle wall
[2:08] <Eztuzt> I want to laod a level that I just downloaded
[2:08] <Lord_Aidan> The wall collapses
[2:08] <Lord_Aidan> And you can attack whoevers inside
[2:08] <Fractal> Lord_Aidan: SAND+GRAVEL
[2:08] <Eztuzt> I havent even tried touching anything like this in months, because it didnt work last time either
[2:08] * Peerko (Peerko@cp541388-b.tilbu1.nb.home.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[2:08] <Lord_Aidan> Well, I mean like ALL blocks
[2:08] <Lord_Aidan> so falling stone
[2:08] <Lord_Aidan> So you make your castle out of stone
[2:08] <Eztuzt> So, I rename the level extension to .mclevel from .dat and it still doesn't show up in the load file browse menu
[2:08] <Lord_Aidan> And during a siege, a enemy could tunnel under
[2:08] <Lord_Aidan> And collapse the walls
[2:08] <Dman757> There is an inconsistency with roofs
[2:08] <Fractal> Lord_Aidan: How the hell would you make a roof?
[2:09] <Eztuzt> Thanks for listening, everyone ._.
[2:09] <AnonymousDonald> Oooh I just found gold in infdev
[2:09] <Lord_Aidan> Blocks wouldnt fall
[2:09] <Lord_Aidan> when connected to four posts.
[2:09] <Eztuzt> It doesnt matter that this problems been plagueing me for months.
[2:09] <Lord_Aidan> So you havea roof
[2:09] <Eztuzt> Ill jsut ramble on while no one listens.
[2:09] <Lord_Aidan> all connected together
[2:09] <Dman757> Triangle
[2:09] <Lord_Aidan> Fine then, a 6x6 area
[2:09] <Lord_Aidan> which if connected to a pillar
[2:09] <Dman757> That would really limit the creative posibilities
[2:09] <Fractal> Lord_Aidan: and if you allow connecting blocks to support others, then people would just build walls with supports
[2:09] <Lord_Aidan> does not fall.
[2:09] <Lord_Aidan> I dunno
[2:09] <Dman757> So like pillars
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> yeah
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> Makes it more realistic
[2:10] <Dman757> to support would be interesting
[2:10] <Fractal> Lord_Aidan: how do you START building a roof?
[2:10] <Eztuzt> Are you guys talking about gravity affecting all blocks?
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> you build the pillars
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> And then build from there
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> I think it would be really cool
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> It would increase the time needed to make a large building
[2:10] <Eztuzt> But still
[2:11] <Lord_Aidan> Just like IRL
[2:11] <Lord_Aidan> So you'd need a team of people.

[2:46] <ZomBuster> you could make a clocktower, put a clock in your house etc etc
[2:46] <Yourself> we've had spring driven clocks since the 1400s

[2:46] <Yourself> bullshit

[2:46] <Pl0x_1> it's the right file path
[2:46] <Yourself> water clocks for even longer
[2:46] <EmpiresBane> then there were those water based ones
[2:46] <Eagle> That is not the 1400s
[2:46] <Wervyn> TF is that, huh.
[2:46] <Eagle> Water clocks would work I GUESS
[2:46] <EmpiresBane> the egyptians had som
[2:47] <Fractal> you could set a pillar of trees burning, (enclosed on all sides with glass) and count the time for 1
[2:47] <Eagle> I'd say
[2:47] <Eagle> MAGIC POWERED CLOCKS
[2:47] <Yourself> the middle ages ended into the 1400s, artard
[2:47] <Wervyn> Anyway, I'd recommend putting that in the system path so that you don't have this problem in the future.

[2:47] <Visiiri> epic fail
[2:47] <Visiiri> I forgot the path
[2:47] <Yourself> the middle ages lasted for 1000 years, the setting could be fucking anything by those standards
[2:47] <Eagle> Yourself: Although
[2:47] <ZomBuster> also I think the ticking sound would give a nice ambience
[2:48] <Eagle> since there are tons of famous painting in the game
[2:48] <Wervyn> I mean, open up environment variables and add ;C:\windows32 to the path variable.
[2:48] <Eagle> it makes sense that it takes place near the end of medeival times/beginning of the renaissance

[3:32] <vurtual> I should write a program called "durr" that's like "dir", with typos.
[3:32] <Fleur> i haz swollen lymph node thingy

[3:44] <Visiiri> vurtual that's gay
[3:44] <Subhazard> Why would that EVER be in the l4d universe?
[3:44] <vurtual> It has a chaingun, rockets that can blast a huge amount of rockets, and has lasers.
[3:44] <vurtual> For a second, I thought quake 2 tank, but saw a l4d discussion
[3:44] <vurtual> So it got stuck in my mind
[3:44] <Subhazard> Vurtual, you've lost typing priveledges.
[3:45] <vurtual> You're just jealous that you never got to kill one of those using only a blaster. :|
[3:45] <Subhazard> I don't know, I've taken down plenty of things with ridiculously underpowered weapons.

[3:51] <AzureAngelic> i was considering steaming
[3:51] <Animator> I want to chop off my thumbs.
[3:51] <vurtual> You're sitting there, knowing there's so many better moves, some you could name, some you can't.
[3:51] <Animator> I cannot feel them.
[3:52] <vurtual> And they're all just being annoyingly dumb, but not all the way to funny-dumb.

[4:04] <kykaro> hey is the whole "leaves falling" thing not working in infdev
[4:04] <Subhazard> At first they idolized me for it, then it became resentment at around 6th grade, and I became an outcast.

[4:06] <vurtual> in fpses

[4:09] <FNugget> lol shit
[4:09] <vurtual> I'm 12 and what is this

[4:11] <vurtual> I was looking that up now
[4:11] <vurtual> :'(

[4:11] <Wervyn> I win then.
[4:11] <FNugget> eh, that was faster
[4:11] * FNugget is satisfied
[4:11] <vurtual> So I could do this:
[4:11] <TestDummy> Visiiri: A THOUGHT
[4:11] <Visiiri> TestDummy: Whut?
[4:11] <TestDummy> In regards to your #help issue.
[4:11] <Visiiri> :D Awesome
[4:12] <vurtual> "I don't hate half of you as well as I should like; and I have beaten the sense out of less than half of you, half as well as you deserve."
[4:12] <Visiiri> What is your thought?
[4:12] <TestDummy> Have you ever tried going off the 0.0.0.0 route?
[4:12] <Visiiri> Hmm, I haven't.
[4:12] <TestDummy> Its gateway is generally the outgoing router for the LAN.
[4:12] <Yourself> onestop.mid is so weird
[4:12] <TestDummy> Given it's the gateway of last resort.
[4:12] <Visiiri> Mhm.
[4:12] <vurtual> That sounds like a q3 map
[4:12] <vurtual> GATEWAY OF LAST RESORT

[4:12] <Visiiri> So you get the 196.whatever
[4:13] <TestDummy> 192, 196.* is an Internet address.
[4:13] <Legolord> rofl.
[4:13] <Visiiri> Yes, you're right.
[4:13] <Yourself> ninja'd
[4:13] <vurtual> 192.196, best of both worlds?
[4:13] <TestDummy> 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/24
[4:13] <TestDummy> Those are private.
[4:13] <Legolord> 192.168.x.x Is most common I believe
[4:13] <TrueWolves> Acording to my logs...
[4:13] <vurtual> what happens if you do 192.196.x.x
[4:13] <TestDummy> "Common" doesn't really matter.
[4:13] <vurtual> does the universe blow up?
[4:14] <TrueWolves> JellyGreen, it says your new, 3=
[4:14] <TestDummy> vurtual: You can assign it internally on your LAN, but it's supposed to be an Internet IP address.
[4:14] <Legolord> Oooh
[4:14] <Visiiri> TestDummy: Yes, they are. So, my batch there should be changed to what?
[4:14] <Yourself> also 10.0
[4:14] <Legolord> I'm 192.168.0.7!
[4:14] <Legolord> :D
[4:14] <Legolord> I mean...
[4:14] <TestDummy> Beats me, I was just giving you an idea of where you should find that information.
[4:14] <Legolord> I didnt say that
[4:14] <Legolord> FORGET THAT
[4:14] <Visiiri> Heh, sounds good.
[4:14] <TestDummy> Namely the 0.0.0.0 route.

[4:32] <vurtual> Hey you know what'd be a cool game
[4:32] <Legolord> Minecraft
[4:32] <vurtual> You know where it's like, some games area bout there being one "traitor" or "infected", out to get everyone else.
[4:33] <Legolord> mmhm?
[4:33] <commie> its called tag
[4:33] <vurtual> If nobody knew at all, and the "infected" was going insane
[4:33] <Legolord> SHHH
[4:33] <Legolord> oooh
[4:33] <Legolord> likey
[4:33] <Superwafflez> And the point of playing the game would be?
[4:33] <vurtual> So they'd slowly lose the ability to communicate with other players
[4:33] <vurtual> And they see other people as the "infected" crazy person, spreading
[4:33] <Legolord> and your the 'infected' but you dont realize it until 2/3 into the game
[4:33] <vurtual> Which, as they assume, makes you into a zombie.
[4:33] <vurtual> So they end up going paranoid and shooting defenseless people, who look zombied to them.
[4:34] <commie> this has what to do with Mc again
[4:34] <vurtual> We never talk about mc in here.
[4:34] <Legolord> Both are epic

[5:27] <Superwafflez> yeah but you cant prove or disprove it
[5:27] <Superwafflez> =D
[5:28] <Yourself> so the default position is that it's not true
[5:28] <PureAdrenallen> Current estimates of brain capacity range from 1 to 1000 terabytes! "Robert Birge (Syracuse University) who studies the storage of data in proteins, estimated in 1996 that the memory capacity of the brain was between one and ten terabytes, with a most likely value of 3 terabytes. Such estimates are generally based on counting neurons and assuming each neur
[5:28] <Fleur> Yourself: i doubt brains are endless internal harddrives and would have a maximum cababillty to remember data
[5:28] <PureAdrenallen> neuron holds 1 bit. Bear in mind that the brain has better algorithms for compressing certain types of information than computers do."
[5:28] <Caleo> that's different from shit I've heard before
[5:28] <Superwafflez> There you go.
[5:28] <Caleo> I've heard figures of 250MB of capacity
[5:28] <Caleo> granted, that seems a little low
[5:29] <Fleur> PureAdrenallen: link that article please
[5:29] <PureAdrenallen> Yeah I don't think so lol
[5:29] <PureAdrenallen> hold on

[5:29] <Yourself> i never said that they were
[5:29] <Yourself> there's obviously a limit
[5:29] <Yourself> there's absolutely no doubt about that
[5:29] <PureAdrenallen> 250 Mb is way to low
[5:29] <Caleo> but you have to think... for every word, smell, sound, there's dozens/hundreds of tidbits of information associated with that locked away in your brain
[5:29] * Fleur sneezes
[5:29] <Yourself> but trying to quantify it is an entirely different matter
[5:29] <PureAdrenallen> Thing is that we don't remember things in mb really
[5:29] <Fleur> the brain can only remember 0.4534megabits of data
[5:29] <PureAdrenallen> so it's not really possible to convert
[5:30] <Yourself> seeing as the way the brain stores information is fundamentally different from computers, it's stupid to measure some nebulous concept of capacity in bytes
[5:30] <Superwafflez> We remember things by associating things we see with memories.
[5:30] <Fleur> PureAdrenallen: ty
[5:30] <Caleo> Yourself: Agreed
[5:30] <PureAdrenallen> A picture could be easier to remember than a word document, but a picture is more data than a word document on a computer
[5:30] <Ladon> How do we know each neuron holds one bit? the article said it was assumed.
[5:30] <Caleo> tis what I was previously trying to say
[5:30] <PureAdrenallen> see what I mean
[5:30] <Fleur> Yourself: O.o it's stored in a similar manner...it has to recieve and store the data
[5:30] <Yourself> it's not stored in bits
[5:31] <Yourself> it's stored in proteins
[5:31] <PureAdrenallen> ^
[5:31] <Fleur> lol i know xD
[5:31] <Fleur> i was fucking around
[5:31] <Yourself> it is nothing like how we store information on machines

[5:31] <Fleur> its stored in BITS of protein
[5:31] <Yourself> sorry, it's hard to tell online
[5:31] <Superwafflez> Lol i love kick starting debates every day on here.
[5:31] <Yourself> there are some people that are really that stupid
[5:31] <PureAdrenallen> Yourself is basically saying exactly what I'm trying to
[5:31] <Caleo> except our brains procedures of storing & retrieving are infinitely different than a hard drive or other mechanical media
[5:31] <PureAdrenallen> ^
[5:32] <Superwafflez> Hard drives make exact copies, brains, not so much.
[5:32] <Caleo> the brain has a fascinating way of procedurally storing data
[5:32] <Caleo> I mean, "procedurally" probably isn't the best way to describe it but ti's the best way I can think of
[5:33] <Superwafflez> In a linear way?
[5:33] <AzureAngelic> i think it's safe to say that we're never gonna figure out how brains work
[5:33] <Superwafflez> Memories attatch themselves to others and start to form a web, in my opinion.

[5:44] <Ladon> Real low.
[5:44] <Fleur> Ladon: O.o it says very nearly two bits
[5:45] <Ladon> I know.
[5:45] <Ladon> About 2.
[5:45] <Fleur> it does seem low though but if your blond it might be 2
[5:45] <Fleur> lolol
[5:45] <Ladon> What?
[5:45] <Ladon> Oh.
[5:46] <Fleur> While this estimate is probably only accurate to within an order of magnitude, Landauer says "We need answers at this level of accuracy to think about such questions as: What sort of storage and retrieval capacities will computers need to mimic human performance?

[7:55] <ExDee> then complain how it doesn't work
[7:55] <Animator> What color would water be 3,000 years into the future?
[7:55] <Wervyn> What kind of water? Distilled water, or with impurities of some sort?
[7:55] <ExDee> depends on the sky, but water is naturally a bit blue, so regardless it's going to be a bit blue
[7:55] * Wildstyle (Wildstyle@CPE-124-176-89-93.lns6.ken.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[7:56] <Wervyn> Water isn't naturally a bit blue anyway, it's naturally clear.
[7:56] <TrueWolves> Nope
[7:56] <Wervyn> It's only blue in general understanding because of the sky.
[7:56] <TrueWolves> Water indeed absorbs red
[7:56] <TrueWolves> So it is naturally blue
[7:56] <TrueWolves> with a bit of green
[7:57] <AlexJS> Wervyn is right.
[7:57] <AlexJS> It's only blue because of the sky
[7:57] <AlexJS> Were the sky red, it would be such.
[7:57] <TrueWolves> It's also blue becuase it absorbs red in tiny amounts
[7:57] <Wervyn> Hmm, citation needed.

[7:58] <Caleo> I imagine for storing stuff but I don't see how
[7:58] <Notething> Right click it
[7:58] <quaxar> TrueWolves I wouldent trust a scizophrenic web design site
[7:58] <quaxar> thats like sourcing a Chemtrails site
[7:58] <Animator> But here's a more specific outline of my question.
[7:58] <Caleo> how do you store stuff in a chest? I'm right clicking but nothing's happening

[7:59] <Animator> What color would the water be 3,000 years into the future after humanity has raped it with impurities?
[7:59] <quaxar> Yeah but I wouldent trust it
[7:59] <quaxar> I would never trust a TIMECUBE style website
[7:59] <Naxza> Caleo, a second inventory-like window should pop up over your own inventory.

[7:59] <Notething> So as far as my question goes so I can get out of here, what's the differences in difficulty on indev? More specifically what does Paradise do?
[7:59] <Caleo> weird
[7:59] * TrueWolves chucks the http://library.thinkquest.org/28170/35.html link at quaxar
[7:59] <Caleo> I wonder if it was because it wasn't in the open
[7:59] <Caleo> tried to stick it in a wall
[7:59] <ExDee> paradise makes it so it's literally a paradise
[7:59] <Caleo> yep
[8:00] <Caleo> that's gotta be it
[8:00] <ExDee> there are no monsters
[8:00] <ExDee> it's always nice outside
[8:00] <Notething> Not the map type, the difficulty.
[8:00] <Wervyn> TrueWolves: Ah, so as an effect of wavelength in general over long distances.
[8:00] <Naxza> Peaceful?
[8:00] <AlexJS> I think Paradise should just be longer days

[8:00] <Notething> Yeah peaceful
[8:00] <ExDee> probably no monsters still
[8:00] <TrueWolves> Basicly
[8:00] <TrueWolves> water absorbs light slowly, it absorbs red faster then green, and green faster then blue
[8:00] <TrueWolves> deep water looks a darker blue

[8:01] <Animator> Always messing with me.
[8:01] <quaxar> TrueWolves all I wanted was science not dumb websites, I know water is blue due to spectrograms
[8:01] <vurtual> no as in a gun
[8:01] <vurtual> which was like, not in any way meant to be a real life gun
[8:02] <vurtual> and aws just a mix of various styles of weapons
[8:02] <TrueWolves> some one asked for a citation, so there.
[8:02] <TrueWolves> Vurtual, Iji
[8:02] <vurtual> I've heard people SAY it was like that in most games, but generally it's always a real life gun
[8:02] <Naxza> For the former, you essentially get one "gun" in Jak 2/3 but find different modifiers that act as different guns.
[8:02] <TrueWolves> you get a gun that shoots like... 8 diffrent projectiles becuase it absorbs diffrent guns
[8:02] <lastwill11> AHHH my infdev is slow there tooo meny pigs

[8:05] <Naxza> I know there were a number of threads about it on the forums, but I don't know if it applies to the current world generator.

[8:25] <LG_Legacy> Wish i could
[8:25] <Naxza> I think one has to understand the difference between grieifing and thievery.
[8:25] <Norend> What's your steam name?
[8:25] <ClassiestMedic> There is a difference
[8:25] <ClassiestMedic> Griefing is wanton destruction BY HAND

[8:25] <Naxza> Wanton is the key word here.
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> and robbery/stealing is taking someone's items usually from a chest
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[8:26] <ExDee> I'll steal too
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> Or will be
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> Me too
[8:26] <KodaichiZero> is it wrong to think your friend's mom is a very attractive woman?
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> We'd have to hide our chests
[8:26] <Naxza> There's a difference between burning down everything you see and digging up others' loot.
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> Yeah
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> And nothing's wrong with tht
[8:26] <Norend> We should be able to make locks
[8:26] <Norend> Or something
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> so long as she;s within 10 years of you
[8:26] <KodaichiZero> how about your own grandma?
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> Sick
[8:26] <ClassiestMedic> Just sick
[8:26] <KodaichiZero> lol
[8:26] <ExDee> my train of thought: I like you, so I'll help you. I hate you so I'll destroy you.
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> I'd be a robber
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> and an arsonist
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> and a murderer
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> :D
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> Snipe people with arrows
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> and then steal their items when they die
[8:27] <KodaichiZero> I'd be a hermit
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> and then loot their house
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> and burn it to the ground
[8:27] <KodaichiZero> living underground with a massive supply of towchez
[8:27] <ClassiestMedic> ^-^
[8:27] <KodaichiZero> nobody would ever be able to find me
[8:27] <Cial> will PKers be looked down on worse than griefers?
[8:27] <TrueWolves> I'll live in the massive maze under my monolith
[8:27] <ExDee> you do know eventually torches will be reprogrammed to run out right?
[8:28] <Naxza> SUNLIGHT, FOO! DAS RIGHT!
[8:28] <KodaichiZero> and when they did, Well I'll have diamond armor so they're screwed
[8:28] <ExDee> so they may or may not disappear
[8:28] <ClassiestMedic> Unfortunately
[8:28] <KodaichiZero> PK = grief
[8:28] <KodaichiZero> dummy
[8:28] <TrueWolves> my monolith uses magma for lighting.
[8:28] <Cial> lava lights
[8:28] <ClassiestMedic> :D
[8:28] <ExDee> PK = grief on a NON PVP server
[8:28] <ClassiestMedic> Unfortunately
[8:28] <ClassiestMedic> someone would delete the protective glass
[8:28] <Naxza> Cial- At this point, there's nothing one can lose that can't be regained pretty quickly, except maybe for diamond or chests full of glass.
[8:28] <ClassiestMedic> and lava would FLOOOD
[8:28] <KodaichiZero> Player Killer.
[8:29] <Cial> just a random thought i had
[8:29] <KodaichiZero> PVP and PK are two different things entirely
[8:29] <Griskard> KodaichiZero
[8:29] <Griskard> If your underground
[8:29] <Griskard> How do you get wood?
[8:29] <TrueWolves> there is no way lava can flood my monolith's lighting.
[8:29] <KodaichiZero> lol
[8:29] <AlexJS> Get a sprout
[8:29] <LG_Legacy> Anyways
[8:29] <Cial> trees underground
[8:29] <ExDee> here's a thought on how to do a team-based survival
[8:29] <AlexJS> Plant it underground
[8:29] <ClassiestMedic> there is
[8:29] <ClassiestMedic> trust me
[8:29] <KodaichiZero> a lot of frigging torches
[8:29] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[8:30] <ClassiestMedic> Disguised skylights!
[8:30] <ClassiestMedic> :D
[8:30] <ExDee> after a select amount of time, you are randomly put onto one of two teams
[8:30] <TrueWolves> hmm...
[8:30] <TrueWolves> My new quest!
[8:30] <KodaichiZero> besides
[8:30] <ClassiestMedic> But I'd come along with my cheat engine and my hax and flood everything with lava - jk
[8:30] <KodaichiZero> with 64 stumps
[8:30] <KodaichiZero> that's all the wood I will ever need
[8:30] <KodaichiZero> I'm not too needy
[8:30] <Caleo> do you have to go pretty far down in minecraft to get good minerals or can you generally find gold/diamonds anywhere?
[8:30] <ExDee> you gain a block you must place within 5 minutes
[8:30] <AlexJS> Not if you use it for firewood
[8:30] <TrueWolves> Is to build an underground magma and torch lighted forest after a kilometer long passage from my monolith!
[8:30] <ExDee> if you destory a block you LOSE
[8:30] <ClassiestMedic> anywhere
[8:31] <ClassiestMedic> but diamonds is rare
[8:31] <ExDee> if your block is destroyed*
[8:31] <ClassiestMedic> and gold is semi-rare
[8:31] <KodaichiZero> on Paradise indev, you can find loads of Iron on the surface. :3

[8:32] <Wervyn> Dig around the very bottom of the map for awhile.
[8:32] <ExDee> there is NOTHING ACTIVATELY TRYING TO KILL YOU
[8:32] <KodaichiZero> tires don exits
[8:32] <TrueWolves> So
[8:32] <ClassiestMedic> I found both
[8:32] <ClassiestMedic> in indev
[8:32] <ClassiestMedic> because
[8:32] <cynicalAlchemist> What setting are there? I noticed Hell, calm, and paradise so far. Is there any others?
[8:33] <ClassiestMedic> I have hax that let me see thru anything

[8:55] <TKoopa> efficient mining?
[8:55] <TKoopa> mine out big rooms
[8:55] <vurtual> no, he is notch
[8:56] <TKoopa> make yourself little underground sewers or homes
[8:56] <TKoopa> dont make yourself rooms
[8:56] <Yourself> that's not most efficient since it wastes a lot of time mining out blocks that don't need to be mined out
[8:56] <TKoopa> make your own rooms
[8:56] <Yourself> the most efficient layout is that which maximizes surface area and minimizes volume

[10:07] <vede> Nexuiz was pretty big in the open-source-arena-game community, then there was a big drama with the 'lead dev' licensing the entire project to some game company so they could make it non-GPL and then assrape the community.
[10:08] <ClassiestMedic> I have so much TNT in and under my base island on a floating map it pretty much blows the whole fucking thing up when I click a TNT
[10:08] <Caleo> lol........... hell?
[10:09] <ClassiestMedic> No
[10:09] <ClassiestMedic> Floating map
[10:09] <ClassiestMedic> But the whole thing - even my mines blows up
[10:09] <ClassiestMedic> and my pasture
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> They all have TNT under them and in them
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> >:D
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> including the mines
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> it's like, fucking Armageddon
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> ^_^
[10:10] <vurtual> Make a timebomb
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[10:10] <vurtual> that can only be defused by destroying a single block
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> I set a TNT on fire
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> then get my ass away
[10:10] <vurtual> which is in a locked control room
[10:10] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[10:10] <vurtual> light a fuse, which burns through the base
[10:10] <vurtual> through a halfblock
[10:11] <vurtual> then metroid escape music
[10:11] <ClassiestMedic> nono, I just light the tnt and GTFO
[10:11] <ClassiestMedic> Seriously
[10:11] <ClassiestMedic> It's epic
[10:11] <ClassiestMedic> There's a small smoking crater
[10:11] <vurtual> not slow enough
[10:11] <vurtual> or challengin enough
[10:11] <ClassiestMedic> and a tiny bit of rock
[10:11] <ClassiestMedic> left
[10:11] <ClassiestMedic> and the island's pretty damn big
[10:11] <ClassiestMedic> or, WAS
[10:12] <vurtual> I love escape sequences.
[10:12] <vurtual> I could do one in minecraft
[10:12] <ClassiestMedic> lol yeah
[10:12] <vurtual> Once you destroy a core in a base, which controls everything somehow
[10:12] <vurtual> It activates a magma timer
[10:13] <vurtual> I remember using omened sand to create an escape timer in minecraft
[10:13] <vurtual> You had to walk from a metroidy gunship, down a watervator, and then into an exact replica of the mother brain room from the original metroid
[10:13] <vurtual> Once MB was deleted, it would cause a sand thing to make magma flow
[10:14] <Superwafflez> no dev updates D=
[10:14] <vurtual> Then you had to go up a 3D jumping sequence, elevator, then use jumping platforms to get into a hallway, do a few jump puzzles, and evetnually reach a walkway around the temple you entered at
[10:15] <vurtual> If you weren't fast enough, sand would block you
[10:15] <vurtual> and you lose
[10:15] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[10:15] <vurtual> if youw ere fast enough, you could jump out at an unblocked point, and onto your gunship, then enter and leave the area
[10:15] <vurtual> The mechanism broke
[10:15] <vurtual> nobody knew, so it was hectic
[10:15] <vurtual> I did it for a friend's birthday at least partially
[10:15] <Subhazard> Installing quake live RIGHT NOW

[10:27] <vurtual> there's a floor so shiny it reflects the ceiling like a mirror
[10:28] <Marach-02> &?
[10:28] <TrueWolves> vurtual, the rest of the story was mostly a scramble of accusations with one person being caught and threatning to trigger TNT in an atempt to kill everyone in the court, even if he died with them
[10:28] <TrueWolves> It was creative so nothing happened though, =B
[10:28] <Darkfire002> whos looking forward to multiplayer :D
[10:29] <TrueWolves> a lot of people
[10:29] <Darkfire002> who here?
[10:29] <TrueWolves> Almost everyone.
[10:29] <vurtual> oh hey I found out that this map is also in two sections
[10:29] <vurtual> a lower and higher one, which I rarely found the elevator between
[10:29] <Darkfire002> if ur talking about a hyvebuild template
[10:29] <Darkfire002> there are 4 sections
[10:29] <Darkfire002> 1 ground 2 water 3 rocky place and 4 the core of the earth
[10:30] <vurtual> no
[10:30] <Darkfire002> oh, well thats a cool map 2
[10:30] <Darkfire002> :D
[10:30] <vurtual> cloud city
[10:30] <Darkfire002> ah
[10:30] <vurtual> There's an upper area, and then the lower half.
[10:30] <Darkfire002> i once made a hell
[10:30] <Darkfire002> and a heaven
[10:30] <Darkfire002> and the heaven was on clouds and stuff
[10:30] <Darkfire002> and if u fell off
[10:31] <Marach-02> vurtual: the best way to know the every single pixel of a map is to remake it in minecraft.
[10:31] <Darkfire002> below had portals
[10:31] <Darkfire002> and the portals leaded to the top of the hell world
[10:31] <vurtual> Marach-02, I can't exactly remake this map
[10:31] <Marach-02> trust me, you don't know anything yet.
[10:31] <vurtual> As it's firstly big
[10:31] <vurtual> And secondly big, thirdly, sci-fi, fourthly, big, and has a gigantic background.
[10:31] <Marach-02> vurtual: that's not an obstacle
[10:31] <vurtual> It wouldn't fit in mc

[11:01] <darkedone02> i think on the snes.
[11:01] <vurtual> Making deadly shrapnel fog, and a huge shockwave
[11:03] <vurtual> You know, I think the entirety of a quake 2 map unit could fit into one source map.
[11:03] <vurtual> It's like the whole thing where portal's entire game area can fit in one map
[11:04] <Visiiri> Creating a 3D image with 2 vanaishing points only works from one direction.
[11:04] <vurtual> vanaishing points?

[11:07] <underd0g> Hello Visiiri
[11:07] <Visiiri> Hi
[11:07] <Visiiri> The special thing abuot this
[11:08] <Visiiri> is that he draws it from a prespective that he isn't looking from.
[11:08] <Visiiri> Especially the ones that are "holes"
[11:08] <Visiiri> The prespective is much higher.
[11:08] <Visiiri> Maybe 10 feet up.
[11:09] <Visiiri> He's truly amazing.
[11:09] <Bodie> Visiiri, is your name icelandic?

[11:09] <darkedone02> I think i remember playing Treasure Mountain when i was at school...
[11:09] <darkedone02> during elemantary.
[11:09] <vurtual> Anyways, I want a 3D driver that works by having two viewports
[11:09] <vurtual> which are on glasses
[11:10] <Bodie> that exists
[11:10] <Bodie> i'm sure of it

[11:10] <Bodie> it would make the most pure 3d

[11:11] <Bodie> fair enough
[11:11] <vurtual> Maybe we're just to shy to say it
[11:11] <Visiiri> It's a very good thing, though.
[11:11] <Bodie> i was looking into getting a tattoo a while back, and was looking up different viking symbols and stuff
[11:11] <Visiiri> He was a troll in his time here.
[11:11] <vurtual> Iiii just wanna tell you the modes
[11:11] <vede> Yeah Ani has a thing for banning the same person numerous times.
[11:11] <Bodie> it sounded like one of those symbols
[11:11] <vurtual> Gotta make you, understand.
[11:11] <Roadcrosser> he regged to GLaDOS
[11:11] <vurtual> He's banned.

[11:12] <Marach-02> hardcore Visiiri.
[11:13] <Visiiri> I am a viking warrior, yes.
[11:13] <vurtual> Try to change the history books to say we were actually at war with eurasia.

[11:14] <vurtual> hl2dm, on a custom map
[11:14] <Marach-02> didnt you cheat for them before
[11:14] <Bodie> ah
[11:14] <vurtual> yea
[11:14] <vurtual> But I died
[11:14] <Bodie> i made my house in source
[11:14] <Bodie> played HL2DM in it
[11:14] <Bodie> fun stuff
[11:15] <vurtual> I made some cool stuff mapping once
[11:15] <vurtual> Mostly entity stuff, like a working combine sniper rifle for ep2
[11:15] <Visiiri> Is level generation possible in gmod or with source?
[11:15] <Visiiri> I know 100% sure that L4D2 does it
[11:15] <Bodie> no idea
[11:15] <vurtual> "level generation"?
[11:15] <Visiiri> Creates levels?
[11:15] <vurtual> no
[11:15] <Visiiri> with properties?
[11:15] <vurtual> l4d2 doesn't do it either
[11:15] <Visiiri> Yes, it does.
[11:15] <Bodie> are you sure it does level generation, doesnt it just randomly scatter the monsters and items?
[11:15] <vurtual> Where is this "creation"?
[11:15] <Bodie> Hellgate london did it
[11:15] <Bodie> and diablo
[11:16] <Visiiri> L4D2 - The Parish - Graveyard
[11:16] <Bodie> thats level generation
[11:16] <vurtual> That's the director randomly spawning and un-spawning stuff
[11:16] <vurtual> that's already defined in the map
[11:16] <Visiiri> So you cannot randomly spawn and unspawn room
[11:16] <Visiiri> s
[11:16] <Visiiri> and consider it generation?
[11:16] <vurtual> no
[11:16] <Visiiri> why
[11:16] <vurtual> It's just random numbers
[11:17] <vurtual> It's like opening and closing doors
[11:17] <Visiiri> open and close rooms
[11:17] <vurtual> not generation
[11:17] <vurtual> Manually pre-defining what can and can't exist

[11:17] <Subhazard> Fuck
[11:17] <vurtual> So BRICKS
[11:17] <Subhazard> My fingers hurt so bad from learning how to rocket jump
[11:18] <Visiiri> It could be a 10x10 grid of cubes
[11:18] <Subhazard> That was a work out.
[11:18] <vurtual> Subhazard, rocketjump training?
[11:18] <Subhazard> Hell yeah

[11:18] <Subhazard> I ran out of rockets :(
[11:18] <Visiiri> and passeges between them could appear/dissapear?
[11:18] <Subhazard> The last one I ran out of rockets.
[11:18] <Subhazard> They gave me 9999
[11:18] <Subhazard> 999*
[11:18] <vurtual> not generation, Visiiri
[11:18] <vurtual> Subhazard, I beat all 3 parts
[11:18] <vurtual> and then beat the secret part
[11:18] <Subhazard> I beat everything except for the last part.
[11:18] <Visiiri> vurtual: randomization works
[11:18] <vurtual> Then id aws like
[11:18] <Subhazard> Well, that was my first introduction to rocket jumping
[11:18] <vurtual> "you're my hero"

[11:19] <Subhazard> I can respect that
[11:19] <vurtual> On my first time
[11:19] <vurtual> Also, I easily beat quake 2 on hard on my first try
[11:19] <Subhazard> Okay now you're getting annoying.
[11:19] <vurtual> Yup.
[11:19] <Subhazard> You sound like me, except for real life shit.
[11:20] <vurtual> wait you do that for rl stuff
[11:20] <Subhazard> Although, rocket jumping is an excellent way to develop timing and hand eye coordination
[11:20] <Visiiri> Quake is stupid
[11:20] <Visiiri> everyone hates quake
[11:20] <Visiiri> because it's stupid
[11:20] <Marach-02> vurtual: did you ever try playing ut2004?

[11:20] <vurtual> The only way you could is by gifting me it or something
[11:20] <vurtual> then getting me to waste time downloading it

[11:22] <Subhazard> Strafe jumping is harder than rocket jumping right?
[11:22] <Subhazard> I'm scared.
[11:22] <Bodie> lol
[11:22] <Subhazard> Also, that fucking bot in the first one, I swear.. she gets harder the better you do.
[11:22] <Bodie> strafe jumping is ridiculous
[11:22] <vurtual> Yes.
[11:22] <vurtual> That's the point.
[11:22] <vurtual> She says that to you.
[11:22] <Subhazard> First you're all like 'haha, training bot, this is gonna be easy'
[11:22] <Bodie> when i was taught the ways of strafe jumping,i was amazed at how fast you can get
[11:22] <vurtual> Like, she says her skill will try to match yours.
[11:22] <Subhazard> But then she starts to kick your ass, so I clench my teeth and turn her into mulch

[11:43] <Visiiri> :)
[11:43] <TestDummy> I mean, with a single server, you wouldn't have those pesky netsplits.
[11:43] <Visiiri> You just want to get rid of us and our many problems.
[11:44] <Animator> I'm afraid that unless Notch does it, no one will.
[11:44] <Visiiri> INcluding that mcsharp asshole who randomspams ads D:
[11:44] <vurtual> I could run it.
[11:44] <mnjiman> I have a spherical keep, 12 radius 35 blocks high
[11:44] <Animator> Vurtual, you could.
[11:44] <mnjiman> Should i have the stairs inside of it going on the wall
[11:44] <vurtual> Well, I'd be running it off a laptop that'd be turnign off, and I can't even make it allow clients from other computers, but teechnically it's still running it
[11:44] <Animator> But keep in mind that the IRC belongs to Notch.
[11:44] <mnjiman> or spiral in the middle/

[11:46] * Marach-02 is now known as Marach-03
[11:46] <Visiiri> I feel that Minecraft is more of a problem for you guys.
[11:46] <TestDummy> It isn't.

[11:46] <TestDummy> You guys just have a lot of stupid newbies, that's all.
[11:46] <Visiiri> :P
[11:46] <Marach-03> yeah, we do :(
[11:46] <Animator> That comes with the popularity.
[11:46] <TestDummy> WHAT'S THIS #DRAGONWEYR THING. I SHOULD CLICK IT
[11:46] <TestDummy> (Don't click it.)
[11:46] <Marach-03> mainly because of the latest blogpost
[11:47] <Marach-03> Notch mentioned "IRC" and everyone came looking for beta invite
[11:47] <Visiiri> That damn blogpost.
[11:47] <Animator> Whoops.
[11:47] <Visiiri> Doubled the IRC's size.
[11:47] * Animator feels retarded now.

[11:49] <vurtual> You have to jump down one at one point
[11:49] <Marach-03> really?
[11:49] <Marach-03> but that blue beam thingy.
[11:49] <Visiiri> I'm not supposed to tell anyone
[11:49] <vurtual> the small platforms can go anywhere
[11:49] <Marach-03> look at how it stretches
[11:49] <tentacos> moving is a pretty dumb idea, unless you plan to move to some other large network or you find someone with an established network who knows how to run it properly
[11:49] <vurtual> but the testchamber locks are vertical
[11:49] <Animator> It is silly.
[11:49] <Marach-03> esper isn't bad.
[11:49] <TestDummy> What tentacos said.
[11:49] <Visiiri> but Notch sent me + other certain people the future link for multiplayer. It's a secret and he said it would be moved and we would be uninvited if we showed anyone.
[11:49] <Marach-03> netsplits are fun after all
[11:50] <Visiiri> We're going to have five hours without noobz
[11:50] <TestDummy> I wouldn't say we're perfect, but we're better managed than some networks out there.
[11:50] <Animator> You better not be lying, Visiiri.
[11:50] <Visiiri> Animator? Why not?
[11:50] <Visiiri> Is there a problem with lying here?
[11:50] <Animator> There's lying.
[11:50] <Animator> And then there's lying about multiplayer.

[11:51] <Visiiri> Well, if I am lying, you will find out soon.
[11:51] <Animator> I've gotten ridiculously tired of that joke.
[11:51] <vurtual> I'll hack his logs one sec
[11:51] <Visiiri> No but really, he invited me for reals.
[11:51] <Roadcrosser> aww
[11:51] <Marach-03> but i still don't understand. why esper and not anything bigger?
[11:51] <Roadcrosser> why didnt he invite ME
[11:51] <Visiiri> Roadcrosser: You're twelve.
[11:51] <Mr_Vegetable> yeah thats the reason were here

[11:52] <Mr_Vegetable> unless you wanna talk about stupid shit lol
[11:52] <UnknownX> Has Notch considered the timezone differences?
[11:52] <Visiiri> UnknownX: I think so.
[11:52] <Marach-03> there are networks that can't terminate the connection without providing a reason
[11:52] <Visiiri> I think he'll come in at about 10pm his time
[11:52] <Animator> Notch chose esper, I know not why.
[11:52] <TestDummy> Time compression! It'll solve everything.
[11:52] <Visiiri> and leave it on all night
[11:52] <Norend> Visiiri, pics
[11:52] <Visiiri> His closed server.
[11:52] <Animator> But it's been good here at esper.
[11:52] <Visiiri> Norend: Sure
[11:52] <TestDummy> Marach-03: We discard the reason if the connection hasn't been established for at least five minutes.
[11:52] <Visiiri> Shit
[11:53] <Visiiri> I can't
[11:53] <Visiiri> Lost my logs.
[11:53] <Yourself> <Visiiri> but Notch sent me + other certain people the future link for multiplayer. It's a secret and he said it would be moved and we would be uninvited if we showed anyone.
[11:53] <Visiiri> Whiped my computer today
[11:53] <Norend> It will be 10PM in Sweden in 7 min
[11:53] <Yourself> you know what would be really funny?
[11:53] <Yourself> is if some of those other people didn't like you
[11:53] <Marach-03> i don't like him enough to /ignore him
[11:53] <Visiiri> But Marach-03 isn't going to be one of those people.
[11:53] <Yourself> and i went to those people and told them to give me said link
[11:53] <tentacos> without providing the reason is great to stop quit spam
[11:53] <Yourself> and then give it to notch and say you gave it away
[11:54] <Yourself> that'd be hilarious
[11:54] <tentacos> I think unrealircd is configured to do the same by default
[11:54] <Norend> If you are not lying Visiiri, you get one million cookies
[11:54] <tentacos> on older bahamut networks I remember quit spam being a problem
[11:54] <Yourself> but then, none of it's real, so that'll never happen
[11:54] <TestDummy> Yeah, it kinda puts a damper on that given every time you reconnect, you have to wait five minutes.
[11:54] <Visiiri> Norend: No sir.
[11:54] <Visiiri> Not lying.
[11:54] <Visiiri> As I remember it,
[11:54] <Norend> We will see.
[11:54] <Norend> I mean I'm not doubting you
[11:54] <Norend> Or believing you
[11:55] <Visiiri> "<Notch> I do plan to invite "selected" people from irc"
[11:55] <Norend> I just want to see what happens
[11:55] <Visiiri> "<Visiiri> Select me?"
[11:55] <Visiiri> "<Notch> If you're online when I am, sure."
[11:55] <Norend> lol
[11:55] <Norend> Why would you be telling us this though?
[11:55] <Visiiri> "<Notch> You're definitely one of the people I want testing with me."
[11:55] <Visiiri> Norend: Just bragging.
[11:55] <TestDummy> Bragger.

[11:56] <Visiiri> Yourself is jealous
[11:56] <Yourself> not particularly

[11:56] <tentacos> Hehehehehhuauhhuahuahu
[11:56] <Visiiri> Yourself: Cool, then do them instead of calling me a douche.
[11:57] <Yourself> well one of those things is calling you a douche
[11:57] <TestDummy> LET'S HAVE AN INTERNET ARGUMENT
[11:57] <Visiiri> YESH
[11:57] <Norend> I want to be selected to playtest, same with the 166+ users
[11:57] <Visiiri> AWRAWRAWR
[11:57] <Norend> But it's nothing to beg about
[11:57] <Visiiri> Norend: No sir.

[11:59] <tentacos> no, it really does
[11:59] <vurtual> Why did someone have to come up with the concept of time travel?
[11:59] <UnknownX> Nobody can have my spot
[11:59] <vurtual> I just want to go into the past and casually use modern technology.
[11:59] <tentacos> I hate the game, everyone who plays it seems like they're retarded
[11:59] <Marach-03> everyone's opinoin about time travel is wrong.
[11:59] <Norend> Visiiri, now you are going to make people stay up all night
[11:59] <vurtual> Like, get a bluetooth ear thing and cellphone
[11:59] <The_Lurker> you know the fake subdomains trick on minecraft.net? survivalmultiplayer.minecraft.net

[11:59] <Norend> And waste valuable time

[12:00] <vurtual> Then, just casually use your laptop
[12:00] <Marach-03> we are the part of time, so we can't go forward 300 years and not age at the same time
[12:00] <The_Lurker> note: fake
[12:00] <vurtual> Read digg, watch videos, play some games.
[12:00] <AndrewPH> mk so I got a virus and I was too lazy to fix what it borked
[12:00] <AndrewPH> so I reformatted
[12:00] <AndrewPH> yay
[12:00] <vurtual> Imagine doing that in like, the 50s.
[12:00] <AndrewPH> now my start menu's fixed
[12:00] <Visiiri> I enjoy bathing in others' envy.
[12:00] <Marach-03> that also solves killing your parents paradox!
[12:00] <Norend> How did you get a virus>
[12:00] <Visiiri> I will work it as long as possible.
[12:00] <vurtual> going to like, 1950, with a modern car and computers and technology.
[12:00] <Yourself> which is why you're a douche
[12:00] <AndrewPH> Norend, rapelay keygen had a trojan
[12:00] <AndrewPH> (irony?)
[12:00] <vurtual> yay I gave AndrewPH a virus \o/
[12:01] <AndrewPH> vurtual, not you
[12:01] <Yourself> i'm hungry, but it's 3 am
[12:01] <AndrewPH> I was in a facepunch thread
[12:01] <AndrewPH> and they mentioned it
[12:01] <AndrewPH> so I googled it
[12:01] <vurtual> I suggested rapelay here
[12:01] <vurtual> which started it all, duh\
[12:01] <AndrewPH> and I was like "I APPROVE"
[12:01] <Yourself> and i don't like eating this late/early
[12:01] <Marach-03> because when you move in time backwards, you age backwards too!
[12:01] <vurtual> Oh man, if I had a time machine
[12:01] <vurtual> Like, maybe a time machine that undoes everything after a bit
[12:01] <Norend> What happened to Notch comming on at 10?
[12:01] <The_Lurker> a fetus flopping on the ground...
[12:01] <vurtual> So I don't blow up the universe, and can mess with people.
[12:01] <Marach-03> and all your memories are lost up to this point as they're just a part of the brain

[12:02] <TVC> Visiiri Pwns
[12:02] <Marach-03> conclusion? using a time machine creates an infinite loop.
[12:02] <Marach-03> don't do it.
[12:02] <Visiiri> TVC: whut
[12:03] <The_Lurker> and you implode?

[12:03] <Norend> No internet
[12:03] <Marach-03> because all your memories about previous travels are lost during them
[12:03] <vurtual> via my time machine wifi
[12:03] <Visiiri> If Tesla were to be born today
[12:03] <Norend> I want to go to the future
[12:03] <Visiiri> He would create an internet company
[12:03] <vurtual> also maybe some magical method for 1950 information
[12:03] <Yourself> hmm, looks like the new MP might be going UDP
[12:03] <Norend> Get a super computer and games
[12:04] <Visiiri> that would cover the world in high speed
[12:04] <Norend> Come back, then play them

[12:04] <Marach-03> impossibl
[12:04] <Marach-03> e
[12:04] <The_Lurker> and show the 1950's the porn-infested hellhole that is the internet?

[12:04] <vurtual> *it rains* "..."
[12:04] <Marach-03> you do you spell "..."?
[12:04] <Marach-03> how*

[12:04] <The_Lurker> with seven dots
[12:04] <vurtual> "Oh and it should end in a few minutes."

[12:06] <Yourself> which were really only meant to last 2 or 3 decades
[12:06] <darkedone02> sure, wait for your flying cars... I wait till I get a giant spaceship made by the blood ravens.
[12:06] <The_Lurker> I have teeth
[12:06] <Animator> Mmm, space elevator.
[12:07] <vurtual> btw I have a spaceship guys

[12:14] <The_Lurker> i'd get on with my life
[12:14] <Marach-03> nope. it's not my theory
[12:15] <Yourself> oh well, then i can't blame you for it not making any sense

[12:15] <Yourself> which you might be
[12:15] <Marach-03> to travel in time without aging along with it, you'd have to get "out" of the time dimension. which is impossible

[12:16] <Darnest> Do... do you guys ever talk about minecraft in here anymore?
[12:16] <Marach-03> what would be interesting if 2 time loops interfered together.
[12:16] <Yourself> yes
[12:16] <The_Lurker> not afaik
[12:16] <Marach-03> Darnest: lol
[12:16] <Yourself> wtf is a "time loop"?
[12:16] <mnjiman> lets do the time warp again?
[12:16] <Marach-03> again.
[12:16] <The_Lurker> a mobius strip in time?
[12:16] <Marach-03> imagine you move back in time.
[12:16] <UnknownX> Apparently when something happens over and over and over again
[12:17] <Marach-03> as you don't get out of time, but rather move along with it, you lose all the memories you had

[12:18] <Subhazard> Then all you would need to do is fold the third dimension in fourth dimension space to move through time.
[12:18] <Subhazard> But time travel is a paradox
[12:18] <Subhazard> And is impossible.
[12:19] <Hatred> Question, What's the best way to screencap in MC? Just printscreen then crop in paint?
[12:19] <Yourself> well, no, that's not accurate
[12:19] <Marach-03> with this theory, it produces no paradoxes
[12:19] <The_Lurker> i'm time travelling atm
[12:19] <Yourself> there's nothing that actually forbids time travel
[12:19] <Subhazard> If time travel IS possible, then everything and nothing would happen, all at once. Think about it, if time travel exists, than time is irrelevant.
[12:19] <The_Lurker> i just can't go backwards
[12:19] <Yourself> well, you can't do it how it's done in movies
[12:19] <Subhazard> As soon as you travel through time, you create a paradox.
[12:19] <Yourself> but movies almost always get everything wrong
[12:19] <The_Lurker> and I can't go faster
[12:20] <Norend> The_Lurker: Me too
[12:20] <Subhazard> Think about it.
[12:20] <Yourself> The_Lurker not in your own reference frame

[12:20] <Yourself> why would you say this?
[12:20] <Subhazard> And you go back in time with a revolver and shoot your doppleganger in the back of the head before he enters the time machine, what happens?
[12:20] <Yourself> you're assuming that time travel would come without restrictions
[12:20] <Norend> You die
[12:20] <Subhazard> Would you?
[12:20] <Marach-03> everyone else here is thinking that you can get "out" of time dimension.
[12:21] <Norend> I don't know
[12:21] <Norend> :V
[12:21] <Subhazard> It's a paradox
[12:21] <Subhazard> You use the time machine to travel back in time to shoot yourself.
[12:21] <Subhazard> Okay
[12:21] <Yourself> Subhazard, it's likely that if it were possible to create a time machine, you would never be able to go back before it was created
[12:21] <UnknownX> I'm moving through time
[12:21] <Yourself> like trying to call a telephone that doesn't exist
[12:21] <The_Lurker> teh government forbids you to travel before the time-machine was invented
[12:21] <Marach-03> to shoot someone, you have to remember you have to. and ayour brain state is reverted to the moment you moved to
[12:21] <Subhazard> So past you is dead, but past you needs to go back in time for you to exist. So it's not a time machine. Time travel can ONLY exist, if there are parallel dimensions.
[12:21] <Marach-03> Yourself: exactly
[12:22] <Subhazard> Meaning, every time we make a decision, reality splits into seperate dimensions. This is called the copenhagen (something)
[12:22] <The_Lurker> you're holding a gun. there's two people in the room. figure it out
[12:22] <Subhazard> Lurker, please shut up.
[12:22] <Marach-03> Subhazard: and that is my second theory. time travel creates a parallel universe
[12:22] <Yourself> you could try to go back in time and shoot yourself
[12:22] <Animator> WE HAVE TO GO 88 MILES AN HOUR, MARTY.
[12:22] <Yourself> but no matter what, something would stop you
[12:22] <Marach-03> Yourself: there is no second you!
[12:22] <Subhazard> No
[12:22] <Yourself> because you already know that you haven't shot yourself
[12:22] <Norend> Shoot both people, the_lurker
[12:22] <Subhazard> That would satisfy the paradox problem, however there's no reason why something would stop you.

[12:23] <The_Lurker> ah
[12:23] <Yourself> Subhazard, yes there is, the fact that you're there to do it is proof that something stopped you
[12:23] <techy> Hey I just had a guy get on my server and say he was a new owner of minecraft
[12:23] <Subhazard> If there are no variables that exist to stop you, then they won't. Something won't appear out of thin air to prevent the paradox.
[12:23] <The_Lurker> slow typing ftl
[12:23] <Marach-03> THERE IS NO PARADOX.

[12:53] <Marach-03> who said he did
[12:53] <Subhazard> If I stop talking
[12:53] <Subhazard> Millions of people die.
[12:53] <Speljohan__> and?
[12:53] <Marach-03> <Subhazard> Hitler had a 'great' idea.
[12:53] <Subhazard> .. I guess that's not a bad thing.
[12:53] <Marach-03> <Marach-03> who said he did
[12:53] <Subhazard> Marach
[12:53] <Merciless> lol
[12:53] <Speljohan__> xactly Subhazard
[12:53] <Speljohan__> loll
[12:53] <Subhazard> There's a reason why there's apostrophes
[12:53] <Subhazard> You dolt.
[12:53] <Subhazard> I don't think hitler is great.
[12:53] <Marach-03> then you can't compare
[12:54] <Marach-03> yourself and hitler
[12:54] <Merciless> he wasnt even aa good military stratagist
[12:54] <Merciless> i mean come on
[12:54] <Speljohan__> me either, stalin was cooler
[12:54] <Merciless> the mistakes that guy made
[12:54] <Speljohan__> way cooler
[12:54] <Speljohan__> and stalin killed more people
[12:54] <Hatred> Right... back to my project.
[12:54] <Speljohan__> so he is obviously cooler
[12:54] <Peerko> damn Marach-03 tell us your idea now
[12:54] <Merciless> stalin had a ballin moustache
[12:54] <Marach-03> it was "stfu"
[12:54] <Merciless> he wins
[12:54] <Speljohan__> ya
[12:54] <Peerko> that idea sucks
[12:54] <Speljohan__> i have underwear with stalin on me right now
[12:55] <Marach-03> i meant Subhazard you know

[15:08] <Subhazard> Well, there are occasionally a few good suggestions.
[15:08] <Vicrry> NOT RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T :P
[15:08] <Luraman> :D
[15:08] <vurtual> "U shud add this" "But...but... I poop from there!"
[15:08] <Subhazard> But I'm getting the feeling that Notch doesn't even look in that sub forum.
[15:09] <Snowman> I don't
[15:09] <vurtual> Subhazard, that's like saying there are good, good-intentioned, and worth-having-around rapists.
[15:09] <Snowman> I can't be assed to wade through heaps of shit to find that single diamond
[15:09] <Subhazard> No.
[15:09] <Subhazard> It's not.
[15:09] <vurtual> It's an uncomfortable truth that's already stretching the truth by admitting it.
[15:09] <Subhazard> At all.
[15:09] <Luraman> Thumps up, if you wanna have ragdoll like dieing animation, and if you die it will go to third person for awesome death

[15:13] <vurtual> From a time when that was proper grammar.
[15:13] <whatdoestha> This channel is currently a shining example of why minors should have restricted access to the internet.
[15:13] <vurtual> no no a shining example why stupid minors should.
[15:13] <vurtual> if you did it for minors, we'd lose half the ops and regulars.

[15:14] <Vicrry> o/ <- Crazy :)
[15:14] <chazbothegr8> what?
[15:14] <vurtual> Some of the mods are in their 20s/30s.
[15:14] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYi3qT1rQzA Am I the only person to like this song?
[15:14] <Subhazard> Which?
[15:14] <chazbothegr8> oh i know not everyone will get an invite
[15:14] <vurtual> I can't stop listening to it.
[15:14] <MC_fanatic> And two: It'll be released like a week after these trial things
[15:14] <MC_fanatic> :D
[15:14] <chazbothegr8> i imagine thoguh if he came now
[15:14] <Subhazard> You're really on a quake kick aren't you Vurtual
[15:15] <MC_fanatic> Yeah... Unlikely though :P
[15:15] <chazbothegr8> all the active people would get invites
[15:15] <vurtual> yes
[15:15] <chazbothegr8> only 9 people
[15:15] <vurtual> I haven't played or even remotely tried to go near any old games from when I was younger, at all.
[15:15] <Luraman|ImFunnYLOLZ> I miss Unreal Tournament :P Lost the Cds
[15:15] <chazbothegr8> that would be fine for a test
[15:15] <vurtual> It's shocking to notice that, despite what other people say, they were all awesome.
[15:15] <MC_fanatic> I'd probably be satisfied with like a 1 + 1 test
[15:15] <Subhazard> Vurtual
[15:15] <Subhazard> This isn't even music
[15:15] <Subhazard> It's ambience
[15:15] <vurtual> I DON'T CARE
[15:15] <MC_fanatic> Smashing pumpkins = awesome
[15:16] <vurtual> THE NOTES STICK INTO MY MIND OK.
[15:16] <Subhazard> 'THIS IS MY PARTICULAR FAVORITE KIND OF WHITE NOISE.... FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF'
[15:16] <vurtual> Okay, you got me there.
[15:16] <Subhazard> S'okay
[15:16] <Luraman|ImFunnYLOLZ> Notch has to choose some one he trust or it will be realeased into the great download sites
[15:16] <vurtual> But it's sorta music-y.
[15:16] <Subhazard> I'll show you some white noise.
[15:16] <Subhazard> Vurtual
[15:16] <vurtual> Enough for that it's stuck into my head.
[15:16] <Subhazard> HAve you got good headphones?
[15:16] <vurtual> I don't use headphones

[15:17] <Luraman|ImFunnYLOLZ> You can get high by it :D
[15:17] * Luraman|ImFunnYLOLZ is now known as Luraman
[15:17] <MC_fanatic> Lol
[15:17] <vurtual> You can't screw with the mind much using sound, if they're able to convince themselves it does nothing.
[15:18] <Luraman> They can, its some program called idoser or something...
[15:18] <chazbothegr8> im just trying to stay active
[15:18] <vurtual> it's not forcing you
[15:18] <chazbothegr8> need SMP invite
[15:18] <MC_fanatic> You can get two different sounds put into your ear which gradually lower, changing your brainwave frequencty and making you A) Energetic B0Sleepy etc
[15:18] <vurtual> You can just resist it by thinking hard against it.
[15:18] <Luraman> Yep exactly
[15:18] <MC_fanatic> Well yeah?
[15:18] <vurtual> Even the strongest ones can be wished away by thinking differently
[15:18] <MC_fanatic> But the point is you go with it

[15:19] <vurtual> Though a strong overpowering noise like those sonicy laser cannons can screw with you.
[15:19] <MC_fanatic> Don't know about getting high but it can change you r mood if *you let it*
[15:19] <chazbothegr8> ...
[15:19] <Subhazard> Okay
[15:19] <vurtual> You're not "letting it change you"
[15:19] <Subhazard> Vurtual
[15:19] <Subhazard> Here you go
[15:19] <vurtual> You're just believing it's changing you
[15:19] <Subhazard> These are binaural beats
[15:20] <MC_fanatic> placebo then
[15:20] <Subhazard> This is a theta level beat.
[15:20] <Subhazard> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKbNybhSDs8
[15:20] <vurtual> I'm not buying into your mindscrew
[15:20] <Subhazard> Sorry it took so long to post the link

[15:20] <vurtual> I avoid drinking too much caffeine just because of the disabling effects
[15:20] <Subhazard> Don't ever use binaural beats that have a stupid fucking name to them
[15:20] <Subhazard> DONT EVER listen to shit like iDoser or Mind whatever.
[15:20] <Subhazard> It's not supposed to be a 'drug'

[15:21] <MC_fanatic> lol
[15:21] <Subhazard> Binaural beats DO have an effect on the brain waves, but only when they're pure.
[15:21] <vurtual> Drugs are straight out not happening.
[15:21] <Subhazard> So, don't listen to shit that's got noise IN it
[15:21] <Subhazard> It's distracting.
[15:21] <Subhazard> Listen to just the white noise.
[15:21] <vurtual> Well I knew this guy, he was all monk-meditation-strong like.
[15:21] <Subhazard> And you'll find yourself in a VERY relaxed state of mind.
[15:21] <MC_fanatic> Tibetan?
[15:21] <vurtual> he was entirely resistant to all of it

[15:21] <chazbothegr8> wtf?
[15:21] <Subhazard> Well, it's not instant.
[15:22] <MC_fanatic> WEll yeah, it doesn;'t force itself on you, it washes over you
[15:22] <vurtual> even after hours of dealing with it
[15:22] <Subhazard> It is half placebo effect, half actual science.
[15:22] <vurtual> He was like "Well, what's meant to happen?"
[15:22] <MC_fanatic> Hes tibetan budhist probably
[15:22] <MC_fanatic> They're 100% aware of everything all the time
[15:22] <vurtual> nope
[15:22] <Subhazard> For one, you have to welcome the effect, if you resist, nothing will happen. If you accept it, and let yourself absorb the ambience, it'll start synching, and then eventually altering your brainwaves.
[15:22] <MC_fanatic> You just said hes a monk?
[15:22] <vurtual> You're just letting yourself feel different, Subhazard.
[15:22] <MC_fanatic> Exactly
[15:22] <Subhazard> I would think so.
[15:23] <vurtual> Maybe you're hearing some moer basic "be calm" word maybe
[15:23] <Subhazard> Because I'm very aware of 'the placebo effect'
[15:23] <chazbothegr8> dont you find it strange that althoguh there is no proof of placebos they are a pillar of medical science?
[15:23] <vurtual> Maybe it's the pattern
[15:23] <Subhazard> But if you sort of.. succumb to it.
[15:23] <vurtual> Like seeing a red wall, and evoking emotion from it
[15:23] <Subhazard> The effects are wonderful.
[15:23] <MC_fanatic> Vurtual there is neurological studies proving it does. You can't just say it doesn't and you're right
[15:23] <Subhazard> It's a bit more effective than that.
[15:23] <vurtual> but it has no fancy control or special magical effect.
[15:23] <Subhazard> It's nothing specific
[15:23] <MC_fanatic> Why would it?
[15:23] <Subhazard> It's states of brain activity, that's it.
[15:23] <vurtual> I learned to not trust studies when they started telling me how the laws of physics should work on me.
[15:23] <Subhazard> It's like a volume dial.
[15:23] <vurtual> "No, you can't do xyz, a study says so!"
[15:23] <Subhazard> It's a good way to FORCE yourself into deep sleep.
[15:24] <chazbothegr8> even if your aware of the placebo effect it can still occur
[15:24] <Subhazard> No it can't.
[15:24] <vurtual> *proceeds to do xyz, person outright refuses to believe it*
[15:24] <Subhazard> If you have no belief in the effect, then it does not work.
[15:24] <vurtual> It's worse than any kind of religious kind of that.
[15:24] <MC_fanatic> Well if a study tells you, you can't fly because of gravity, I'd believe it
[15:24] <chazbothegr8> subhazard it can
[15:24] <Subhazard> If you know that it is fake, and it effects you anyways, then it's not a placebo effect.
[15:24] <vurtual> I'll see who can and can't fly
[15:24] <Subhazard> What do you know, you're fucking 13.
[15:24] <MC_fanatic> Lol
[15:24] <chazbothegr8> like strepsils
[15:24] <vurtual> Sure sure, I'm 13 alright.
[15:24] <Subhazard> Not you vurtual.
[15:25] <Subhazard> You're just dumb :P
[15:25] <vurtual> oh
[15:25] <chazbothegr8> what me?
[15:25] <vurtual> he's 13 alright
[15:25] <chazbothegr8> no i arnt im 2
[15:25] <Subhazard> Yes, definately 13.
[15:25] <vurtual> I should file you trying force your crazy stuff on me as assault... that'd probably work in the US courts if I acted I-got-raped-y enough.
[15:25] <vurtual> then again someone might try to use common sense.
[15:25] <Subhazard> Forget it.
[15:25] <Mithril> Wtf minecraft suddelnly started to allocate 100% of the momry

[15:25] <Siiseli> the motto for this channel is "HURP-A-DERP DURP HURP HURR DURR"
[15:25] <chazbothegr8> what is it?
[15:25] <Subhazard> Indeed.
[15:26] <vurtual> Ooooh look, some people can get into that state where they can influence their dreams!
[15:26] <whatdoestha> That's an appropriate motto.

[15:26] <Subhazard> 'I don't have the time for lucid dreaming'
[15:26] <chazbothegr8> What is Lucid Dreaming?
[15:26] <Siiseli> chazbothegr8, google it
[15:26] <Subhazard> That's like saying you don't have time to shit.
[15:27] <chazbothegr8> okay brb
[15:27] <vurtual> Not the whole "even touching my neck makes me snap out at people, or jolt away" thing directly.
[15:27] <Subhazard> You lucid dream.. while... you're asleep.
[15:27] <MC_fanatic> 99.9 % iof people can't actively LD. Who'd slag you?
[15:27] <vurtual> The shockingly large amount of people who do, all the time.
[15:27] <vurtual> And then try to make fun of me for it.
[15:27] <Subhazard> MC_fanatic, where the fuck did you get that statistic from?
[15:27] <MC_fanatic> Subhazard, theres alot of waking effort too you know
[15:27] <Subhazard> Did you just pull that RIGHT out of your ass without lubrication?
[15:27] <vurtual> Jokes on them when they try to sneak by me or touch me, then I whirl around and stare them down.
[15:27] <Subhazard> No, answer me.
[15:27] <Subhazard> Where did you get that statistic?
[15:27] <chazbothegr8> im bk

[15:28] <Subhazard> So, out of 1000 people, one person you've asked can.
[15:28] <MC_fanatic> And i've spoken to well over 100 people
[15:28] <chazbothegr8> how does one go about lucid dreaming?
[15:28] <vurtual> You could jump down the empire state building, then halfway down, just get absorbed in the slow waterfalls of lube, and die there
[15:28] <MC_fanatic> 1000*
[15:28] <Subhazard> No, 99.9?
[15:28] <vurtual> perfectly clear, almost unseeable, lube.

[15:28] <Subhazard> MC_fanatic, I refuse to believe you've asked 1000 people about lucid dreaming.
[15:29] <MC_fanatic> No, im the only one whos even attempted it. And is till can't
[15:29] <MC_fanatic> DAMMIT SUBHAZARD!
[15:29] <vurtual> If I slap my thighs, it reminds me of tomatoes.
[15:29] <MC_fanatic> Stop taking what I say out of context
[15:29] <Subhazard> I'm not.
[15:29] <Vicrry> lolz Vurt :P
[15:29] <vurtual> now I want tomatoes
[15:29] <Subhazard> You said 99.9% of people can't lucid dream.
[15:29] <Subhazard> That means that you've spoken to AT LEAST 1000 people.
[15:29] <Siiseli> that's bullshit
[15:29] <MC_fanatic> I've had conversation with lots of people about Ldint, and tbh I can see it being fa\r more than 1 in 1000
[15:29] <vurtual> hmmm
[15:30] <vurtual> I don't think they taste like tomatoes.
[15:30] <Vicrry> The topic < - Notice the big gap? -> What Vurt is talking about.
[15:30] <Subhazard> lol vicrry
[15:30] <Subhazard> my hero
[15:30] <vurtual> It's called changing the topic.

[15:30] <Superwafflez> Lucid dreaming is quite possible.
[15:30] <vurtual> I was playing the super mario world overworld theme on my thighs, that gets all the chicks.
[15:30] <Subhazard> 'Guys! Cmon! Let's go play hide and seek! Guys, cmon, let's go dance in the street! Guys! cmon! Hello?'

[15:31] <vurtual> About... 50, AT MOST, irl.
[15:31] <chazbothegr8> im going to try and lucid dream tonight
[15:32] <vurtual> that's influenced by the number of waitresses I had to speak to for two seconds
[15:32] <MC_fanatic> Sub I'm not betting i've talked to over a thousand people, I'm betting my life that well over 1 in 100 wouldn't be able to LD
[15:32] <MC_fanatic> You're misinterpreting what i say
[15:32] <vurtual> MC_fanatic, nobody knows.
[15:32] <GoaLitiuM> chazbothegr8: good luck with that

[15:33] <Subhazard> See.
[15:33] <MC_fanatic> Well yes obviously. no one knows an exact statistic. If i had asked 1000 people that wouoldn't mean 1 in 1000 can LD. It would mean that 1 out of that 1000 could
[15:33] <Subhazard> That's such a waste of a lucid dream.

[15:34] <Subhazard> If I had the chance to lucid dream, I would create my own flying contraption made out of glowing marble slabs that floated weightlessly through the air based on my touch, they would hum a deep, resonant sound every time I changed the speed or direction. Boy that would be fun.
[15:34] <vurtual> 8 sorta-hot-chicks added in and bam

[15:43] <chazbothegr8> vurtual it doesnt matter
[15:43] <Subhazard> Or for that matter, how old do you want me to think you are.
[15:43] <vurtual> Gradually, as I got older, it developed into acting like people when I'm around them, or acting like a certain person in certain settings.
[15:43] <chazbothegr8> i mean subhazard not vurtual
[15:43] <Subhazard> I already know your opinion Chaz.

[15:49] <vurtual> get someone idolizing me to take one
[15:49] <vurtual> Not humor the request, mess around with the person more.
[15:49] <whatdoestha> You're trying to prove a logical point, while he's got his fingers in his ears dancing around like a fool. It doesn't work.
[15:49] <vurtual> Use fire.
[15:49] <vurtual> Hmm.
[15:49] <Subhazard> He'll slip.
[15:49] <Subhazard> And then he'll jam his finger.
[15:49] <vurtual> I've been doing this for at least a decade.
[15:49] <Subhazard> What, acting like an idiot?
[15:49] <vurtual> Not slipping.
[15:49] <vurtual> well very much at least
[15:49] <Subhazard> Congratts.
[15:49] <MC_fanatic> Hazard it doesn't matter cause you can't prove anything he gives you is genuine. So even if he does give you something your just going to be a spa and say thats not really can crawl back into you're whole of denial.
[15:50] <vurtual> okay I finished singing the jeapordy think music
[15:50] <whatdoestha> "you're whole"
[15:50] <Subhazard> He could take a picture of his ID (blacking out the private bits ofcourse)
[15:50] <MC_fanatic> Denial, about you're own stubborness and really just. Sadness
[15:50] <vurtual> While using fire is a good idea, screwing with you or not humoring your request at all is best.
[15:50] <MC_fanatic> Or he could not and get on with his fgucking life
[15:50] <Subhazard> You keep telling us that.
[15:50] <whatdoestha> "you are own stubborness"
[15:50] <vurtual> MC_fanatic, look up the use of "your", "you're", and "yore".

[16:51] <vurtual> Anyone who's not a horrible person gets one
[16:51] <Cintiq> or destroy
[16:51] <vurtual> no no Cintiq
[16:51] <vurtual> get out

[16:51] <whatdoestha> There is no griefing in survival.
[16:51] <vurtual> technically so is a taser
[16:51] <Nyght> And if they get interrupted half way through mining
[16:51] <Cintiq> derp.

[16:53] <Cintiq> Azathoth: That or it'll be a bigger problem, for the same reason.
[16:53] <whatdoestha> Besides, in creative mode, claiming territory is just as big of a griefing tool.

[16:54] <Cintiq> i think given enough tweaking that could work
[16:54] <Nyght> Omg that would be so hawt
[16:54] <Cintiq> although again griefing could be used
[16:54] <Cintiq> lmao
[16:54] <Nyght> Griefing would be the point
[16:54] <Nyght> Nation vs Nation
[16:54] <vurtual> Pillaging and raping
[16:54] <Nyght> Your wanting to obliterate the enemy

[16:54] <vurtual> *more ganon theme*
[16:54] <whatdoestha> I think the real balance changes to MP survival will generally consist of making things take longer and require more resources. It promotes teamwork, it provides some initial reason for competition, and balances things out a bit more.
[16:54] <blaster> YESH
[16:54] <Cintiq> building catapaults and such

[16:55] <chazbothegr8> VIRTUAL has notch given out invites yet?

[16:55] <Nyght> Just being on notches good side?
[16:55] <Nyght> =p
[16:55] <vurtual> FATAL says most males in the medieval peroid have taken part in a gangrape
[16:56] <whatdoestha> If resources are more difficult to obtain, looting and defending has a much greater purpose, which ties into blocks being hard to destroy. This encourages people to work together in small groups to be able to accomplish anything.
[16:56] <vurtual> WHO ARE YOU TO TELL THAT FACTUALLY CORRECT RPG IT IS WRONG
[16:56] <Azathoth> lol
[16:56] <Azathoth> <3 fatal
[16:56] <Cintiq> touch?
[16:56] <Cintiq> ^not sure if that shows up on other clients
[16:56] <chazbothegr8> i agree with whatdoestha
[16:56] <vurtual> it does
[16:56] <Azathoth> vurtual, do you have a copy of fatal?
[16:56] <chazbothegr8> thats why iv joined a survival mp clan
[16:56] <vurtual> Anywas yes raping should be a mechanic
[16:56] <vurtual> never tell anyone
[16:56] <vurtual> But, when someone's pinning someone, looting them/torturing them
[16:57] <whatdoestha> And if making tools requires more resources, it's harder to mount as much of an offense solo, hindering solo griefers. It also makes stealing/denying the enemies' tools more worthwhile.
[16:57] <vurtual> They should eventually notice the button
[16:57] <Nyght> adding on to whatdoestha i think it would be awesome if blocks had a quality level, like you can spend a certain amount of time placing a block instead of just placing it
[16:57] <vurtual> just placing is cool
[16:57] <Nyght> So High quality blocks= Harder to destroy
[16:57] <vurtual> building take slong enough
[16:57] <chazbothegr8> is ntoch still on his live stream
[16:57] <whatdoestha> Well, that can be solved with an expanded thing like converting cobblestone into solid stone now
[16:57] <Nesral> Yep Chaz
[16:57] <chazbothegr8> does anybody have a link?
[16:57] <Nesral> http://www.mojang.com/live/
[16:57] <Azathoth> i still think cobblestone > smooth stone should be done with a chisel
[16:58] <chazbothegr8> thankyou so much
[16:58] <Nyght> There needs to be a system that allows the character to strengthen his blocks
[16:58] <Azathoth> ->*
[16:58] <chazbothegr8> you sexy beast
[16:58] <vurtual> use better blocks
[16:58] <Nesral> :3
[16:58] <Nesral> No problem :b
[16:58] <whatdoestha> And again, goes back into "making things take longer" so that completely solo play is a bit weaker, but not impossible. You could still hide in a mountain for a long time, slowly accumulating wealth alone.
[16:58] <vurtual> chazbothegr8, anyone watching gets no invite
[16:58] <vurtual> Chances are if minecraft remotely had a rape mechanic, or a copulation mechanic
[16:58] <Azathoth> i always imagine mp survival as being more of a small team type of game
[16:58] <vurtual> when the grim open source day comes
[16:58] <Azathoth> and not one large enough for different factions
[16:58] <vurtual> Someone would make it into a simulator that makes RapeLay cry
[16:59] <Azathoth> more like a small close-knit group of people venturing out to build something epic
[16:59] <Azathoth> trying to make a living in the hostile world of minecraft
[16:59] <Nyght> Your going to have those
[16:59] <Nyght> and then you'll probably have Nation vs Nation as well
[16:59] <Darkflux> When we get levers and stuff, we should be able to make traps for griefers
[17:00] <whatdoestha> Also, if bricks take a longer time to destroy/mine/etc, it makes actively destroying a structure much less worthwhile. Just limit the amount of TNT and such that can be carried at a time.
[17:00] <Darkflux> I guess a door block would be handy too
[17:00] <Azathoth> isn't a door on the todo list?
[17:00] <vurtual> That'd be creepy, if someone made a minecraft upgrading project, to expand every feature
[17:00] <vurtual> Then someone anonymously slips in a rape sim
[17:00] <Daroh> *shrug* i dont see the use in TNT, a well placed creeper does the job better
[17:00] <Nyght> Perhaps with Solidiron It makes it almost impossible to delete it with a tool
[17:00] <Nyght> Unless you were the one that placed it
[17:00] <chazbothegr8> how does one go about chatting in livestream?

[17:02] <Darkflux> As far as I'm concerned, I'll get to play when the beta ships anyway
[17:02] <Darkflux> so what's the rush?
[17:02] <Azathoth> OMG OMG OMG INVITES
[17:02] <Nyght> Same
[17:02] <Azathoth> it's not fucking gmail
[17:02] <MC_fanatic> You were a 12 year old too you know

[17:03] <Nyght> LOLWUT

[17:03] <chazbothegr8> you can chat if you log in!
[17:03] <Cintiq> sure it'd be cool
[17:04] <Azathoth> japanese companies make dating sims for anything imaginable
[17:04] <chazbothegr8> how do i log in?
[17:04] <Cintiq> but it'd be buggy as hell
[17:04] <chazbothegr8> what with?
[17:04] <chazbothegr8> were od i sign up?
[17:04] <Cintiq> all you need is a handful of beta testers tbh.

[17:04] <Superwafflez> there was more than one? D=
[17:04] <Azathoth> and hardly even playable when he first makes it
[17:04] <vurtual> bugs rae funny

[17:04] <Azathoth> but everyone likes to jump the gun and they were all playing infdev before it was even playable
[17:04] <Nesral> Bugs are the best
[17:04] <Superwafflez> It was just Sim Girl as far as I know.
[17:04] <Azathoth> and then baaawwwing at the missing features
[17:04] * Fractal_ is now known as Fractal

[17:05] <Nesral> format
[17:05] <Azathoth> WHY CANT I SAVE!??!? OMG Y DID U REMOVE CRAFTING. OMG THE GAME CRASHES WEAR IS LIGHTING?!
[17:05] <MC_fanatic> Yeah, hope its in the bin
[17:05] <Cintiq> by bin i meant permanantly deleted
[17:05] <Cintiq> Superwafflez: I shift+del everything I delete.
[17:05] <MC_fanatic> woah

[17:06] <Cintiq> safe.
[17:06] <Azathoth> eww
[17:06] <vurtual> hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh always looks blue
[17:06] <MC_fanatic> Yum
[17:06] <Cintiq> it managed to get itself into a completely unrelated folder
[17:06] <vurtual> While |||||||||||||||||||||||||, in some fonts, looks green
[17:06] <RaidSoft> disabling the recycle bin in the first place ftw
[17:06] <MC_fanatic> Morally of the story, dont freak out
[17:06] <Azathoth> the biggest things my pussy kills are cockroaches
[17:06] <Nyght> So if multiplayer is going to be INF there needs to be mounts
[17:07] <Nyght> Of some sort
[17:07] <Superwafflez> no there doesnt
[17:07] <vurtual> so if I insert into you, I'll lose STDs, Azathoth?
[17:07] <Azathoth> yeah. it's really not necessary
[17:07] <Azathoth> O_O
[17:07] <Azathoth> yep
[17:07] <vurtual> yay
[17:07] <Azathoth> mounts + minecraft = meh
[17:07] <Superwafflez> omg take my herpes!
[17:07] <vurtual> Also yes on mounts
[17:07] <vurtual> any mob
[17:07] <Nyght> ^
[17:07] <RaidSoft> riding on creepers ftw :D
[17:07] <vurtual> Jump on it and hit it with weapon
[17:07] <vurtual> that's a harness
[17:07] <Nyght> Have a lasso tool
[17:07] <Nesral> Creeper + Mount
[17:07] <vurtual> Then, dependingo the mob, things happen
[17:07] <whatdoestha> ...no.
[17:07] <Nyght> Thats hard as hell to craft
[17:07] <Superwafflez> lol stick a pick into a pig and ride it
[17:07] <vurtual> Creepers moan, zombies die
[17:08] <vurtual> skeletons trap you in their bones
[17:08] <Nyght> Use the laso tool on a mod successfully and you train it
[17:08] <Azathoth> creepers do moan
[17:08] <Azathoth> right before they explode
[17:08] <vurtual> spiders zoom off quickly
[17:08] <Nyght> Thus making it "rideable"
[17:08] <Superwafflez> So uhh are weapons and items going to be visible from other players views?
[17:08] <vurtual> pigs just walk around, ignoring your movements partially
[17:08] <vurtual> and sheep are good mounts
[17:08] <Superwafflez> Or are we going to look like retards staring at walls...
[17:08] <Azathoth> he probalby hasn't planned that far ahead, wafflez
[17:08] * blaster (heliduels@89.241.97.14) has joined #minecraft
[17:08] <vurtual> Players, if hit, can moan, or try to break free, but not really.
[17:08] <whatdoestha> I don't see why they wouldn't be visible eventually.
[17:08] <blaster> Ok my PC is working now
[17:08] <Azathoth> congrats
[17:09] <vurtual> lots of moaning
[17:09] <blaster> It decided now would be a fun time to reinstall ALL VIDEO DRIVERS
[17:09] <Azathoth> and LAUNCH ALL NUKES
[17:09] <Superwafflez> Windows 7 makes it rather easy.
[17:09] <blaster> It restarted at one point with half of the video drivers needed
[17:09] <blaster> So it was running with a VRAM that could barely run vista
[17:09] <vurtual> btw notch do you know lailai's hanging out many times over in your channel?
[17:09] <Superwafflez> rofl

[17:10] <Azathoth> lol darkfux
[17:10] <Azathoth> random people would just be like "wait wtf?"
[17:10] <vurtual> heheh
[17:10] <MC_fanatic> I get a new one every 7 - 10 years
[17:10] <Azathoth> i get a new one every 2-3 years
[17:11] <MC_fanatic> Whenever it explodes
[17:11] <MC_fanatic> Y'know
[17:11] <blaster> I get a new one every never
[17:11] <Azathoth> 7 years is way too long... holy shit
[17:11] <Nesral> I had mine for .. 7 years now.
[17:11] <Nesral> Didn't bother to upgrade
[17:11] <blaster> And even when I do get a new one it is terrible
[17:11] <MC_fanatic> HP compact - intel core 2 duo or some bullshit i havent a clue
[17:11] <blaster> Because everything in the UK costs twice as much for some shitty reason
[17:12] <MC_fanatic> Trice in ireland :P
[17:12] <whatdoestha> Import taxes, enjoy your VAT
[17:13] <blaster> Stupid fucking communist government
[17:13] <MC_fanatic> 14% against 21 and a half. GB wins
[17:13] <MC_fanatic> Capitalism sucks Blaster, feel lucky
[17:13] <blaster> Paying people who don't work more than people who do work
[17:13] <whatdoestha> Huh? The tax is the opposite.
[17:13] <blaster> ?
[17:14] <MC_fanatic> Impossible blaster unless you're working minimum wage one day a week parttime
[17:14] <whatdoestha> You're paying the government more, as something of a "penalty" for buying foreign goods
[17:14] <MC_fanatic> LOl
[17:14] <MC_fanatic> And they're still cheaper than local shit
[17:14] <whatdoestha> Oh
[17:14] <whatdoestha> Wait
[17:14] <blaster> And local shit is... shit
[17:14] <whatdoestha> I misread what you said, haha. Shit.
[17:14] <MC_fanatic> Lol, the musical instrument industry is a rime example

[17:23] <Speljohan_> "TERRORISTS OMG"

[17:23] <MarkofBear> or just that mao zedon(typo?) killed more people than hitler
[17:23] <MarkofBear> and no im not a hitler fan
[17:24] <blaster> Hitler did not go around killing people personly
[17:24] <Speljohan_> "HMM THIS COUNTRY DISAGREES WITH US, THEY MUST BE COMMUNIST-MUSLIM-TERRORISTS!!21312"

[17:24] <blaster> I think anyone would struggle to kill more than a few thousand in their life
[17:24] <MarkofBear> i seriosly love how the US people look at guantamabo
[17:24] <Speljohan_> loll ye
[17:24] <Speljohan_> it wouldn't surprise if they start blaming cuba for it

[17:25] <MC_fanatic> Stalin was a real laugh though, lets kill -insert large figure here- of my own nationals
[17:25] <Speljohan_> truth is, usa is scared of the uprising leftism in south america MarkofBear
[17:25] <Speljohan_> cus it threaten their ideals
[17:25] <Speljohan_> threatens*
[17:25] <blaster> USA is scared of everything that can even touch them
[17:25] <Speljohan_> and econom9ical possibilities
[17:26] <MC_fanatic> Blaster: Thats cause it can threaten everything else with bombs
[17:26] <blaster> I touched the USA once, it has alot of tarmac on the ground. Good thing I didnt touch a cactus part of the USA

[17:27] <MarkofBear> my sis has lived in the US for 7 years
[17:27] <blaster> It does not have any affect though
[17:27] <MarkofBear> and she thinks it funny how they elect presidents
[17:27] <Speljohan_> awesome MarkofBear
[17:27] <blaster> just a little message and nothing happens
[17:27] <MarkofBear> for example a bush fucks the country up
[17:27] <blaster> I think other people are getting it as well
[17:27] <MarkofBear> another man fixes it but the people hate him for it
[17:27] <Speljohan_> they elects presidents based on their wealth MarkofBear
[17:27] <MarkofBear> cause he must raise taxes and so on
[17:27] <blaster> Because googling it shows others have the problem
[17:28] <MarkofBear> yeah but when someone fixes one of the bushes faults
[17:28] <MarkofBear> and when its fixed... they elect another bush that can fuck it up
[17:28] <Speljohan_> thing is, it doesn't matter how much anyone wants to "change" usa MarkofBear
[17:28] <Speljohan_> it's already too corrupted
[17:28] <MarkofBear> yeah
[17:28] <Speljohan_> it would take like 100 years to fix
[17:28] <Speljohan_> with slow chance
[17:28] <MarkofBear> i think obama is a good start though
[17:28] <Speljohan_> and that won't happen
[17:28] <Speljohan_> i am sceptical
[17:28] <Speljohan_> very sceptical
[17:29] <MarkofBear> but they will just elect bush again after that

[19:15] <Speljohan_> also i do not have my main pc

[19:16] <commie> played a lot of total war tho
[19:16] <vurtual> befriend everyone tactic
[19:16] <Speljohan_> and expand like a motherfucker
[19:16] <blaster> It blocks the opponents until alot later
[19:16] <vurtual> anyways blaster, you don't have BTS?
[19:16] <blaster> No
[19:16] <blaster> Its hard to find expantions on their own
[19:16] <vurtual> hmmm
[19:16] <Speljohan_> i disliked total war because of the terribad multiplayer
[19:16] <vurtual> There's a DEMO?
[19:16] <blaster> Usualy they are bundled with the original game
[19:17] <vurtual> on steam
[19:17] <vurtual> and they charge... 20 dollars for BTS on steam
[19:17] <blaster> Eh
[19:17] <blaster> I dont have it registered on steam
[19:17] <vurtual> yet the complete edition(the whole game, including bts and warlords)
[19:17] <blaster> It was a steamless instal
[19:17] <vurtual> civ iv keys don't work btw
[19:17] <vurtual> complete edition saves 39.97
[19:17] <vurtual> pay 20 on bts, or 30 on col, bts, warlords, and iv
[19:17] <Speljohan_> tbh, if a strategy games has shit multiplayer it is a shit game
[19:17] <blaster> I think I will wait til civ5
[19:17] <Speljohan_> with the exception of homm3
[19:17] <vurtual> civ v will suck

[19:18] <Speljohan_> no stacks is better imo
[19:18] <vurtual> I WANT CIV
[19:18] <vurtual> Maybe nerfed stacks
[19:18] <Speljohan_> because it will make combat more interesting

[19:19] <Speljohan_> civ5 will become more tactical no doubt

[19:21] <Speljohan_> 4 wasn't a bad game
[19:21] <Speljohan_> it could have been way better tho

[20:15] <Mithril> this is the 3rd time I died and the 2nd I fell in lava
[20:15] <Packman> im looking at worm online* is it simliar to minescraft?
[20:15] <SireTRM> In some aspects
[20:15] <Mithril> And as there is no opblock in infdev you cant get out of the lava
[20:15] <SireTRM> It's like a MUCH more complicated MC
[20:16] <Cue> Wurm has a giant spider.
[20:16] <Packman> i dont like the graphics of i
[20:16] <CanisUrsa> Giant spiders that kill you
[20:16] <Packman> why would he make his own game if hes a dev of wurm? aside from money
[20:16] <Cue> Packman: Minecraft's are deliberately poor, that's why they look good. :3
[20:16] <Cue> Also, why not?
[20:17] * Marafk-04 is now known as Marach-04
[20:17] <Cue> Wurm isn't the most popular games ever

[20:17] * Marach-04 attempts to understand Cue
[20:17] <Packman> thanks cue
[20:17] <Packman> no i mean, i like minecrafts graphics i dislike wurms
[20:17] <Ruska> i remember making a large city in wurm
[20:17] <Cue> Yeah, I know

[20:51] <Bodie> he probably wants to code
[20:51] <Norend> Because you touch yourself at night
[20:51] <Fleur> because you morons will bum rush him with questions
[20:51] <arxx> ...
[20:51] <Bodie> not answer questions which people could find out by reading eh news :P
[20:51] <Wervyn> They would come out of the ocean, with axes and fire, and pillage your house and rape all your sheep.

[20:52] <Norend> k
[20:52] <Ruska> If notch is online, why isnt there a god damn ham sandwich in game yet
[20:52] <Norend> Notch is probably making oen
[20:52] <Drewseph> I think all the food in the game is over powered
[20:52] <Malikat> pork chop sandwiches!
[20:52] <Codlike> Notch is NOLONGER online
[20:52] <Codlike> he dc'd
[20:52] <Fleur> if i see one more porkchop ill ie
[20:53] <Malikat> Drewseph: i kind of want to see pancakes put in game, as the only stackable food. :3
[20:53] <Bodie> dont you love beating pigs to dead with porkchops?
[20:53] <Drewseph> lol
[20:53] <Drewseph> mal, yeah that;d be fun
[20:53] <Dilt> Notch doesn't come here because he doesn't handle large crowds of people well :(
[20:53] <Fleur> Malikat: lol
[20:53] <Malikat> pancakes would take like, two wheat to make
[20:53] <Fleur> brb
[20:53] <Drewseph> I think the food though needs to have diff perks for everything
[20:53] <Dilt> Plus everyone swarms him the moment he talks
[20:53] <Malikat> and only heal half a heart
[20:53] <Malikat> or one heart at most!
[20:53] <Norend> If he talks
[20:53] <Codlike> Notch was on earlier
[20:53] <Norend> Everyone in the chat is going to go crazy
[20:54] <Wervyn> And if you eat too many at once you get a heart attack and lose 9 health.
[20:54] <Dilt> He should sneak in with an alias and talk about minecraft, that's usually where the best ideas are gotten
[20:54] <Dilt> from idle chatter
[20:54] <Malikat> i suspect notch is off doing other things, since he announced he would be back at 8 CET for more livestream
[20:54] <TerraSleet> that's what BananaBot is for :P
[20:54] <Fleur> babies are so moronic they need people to put the bottle in their mouth when its right next to them
[20:54] <Fleur> BABIES ARE LAZIER THEN ME
[20:54] <Dilt> i love how we helped buy notch his new home
[20:54] <Dilt> :D

[21:27] <Eagle> ... 1/6 what
[21:27] <Eagle> oh french
[21:27] <Bodie> 1/6 of canada is french
[21:27] <Eagle> yeah that's nothing to brag about
[21:27] <coladash> of candians are francophones
[21:27] <Norend> french canadians are dicks
[21:27] * Fleur can't think of a smartass comment
[21:27] <Bodie> there was some talk of changing our flag
[21:27] <coladash> Yeah I never really liked french
[21:27] <Bodie> australian flag that is
[21:28] <Bodie> i'm for it... the aussie flag isn't overly special
[21:28] <coladash> but hey I can't complain thier poutine is DELICIOUS!

[21:28] <Bodie> no idea
[21:28] <Eagle> oh wait canada does
[21:28] <Ruska> eagle, was it with american or canadian ketchup
[21:29] <Codlike> Merging the Aboriginal Flag and the Curren one with the Union Jack and southern cross was a bad Idea
[21:29] <Codlike> personal opinion
[21:29] <Eagle> they don't sell ketchup flavored chips in america
[21:29] <coladash> one of the things I hate about canada: Late night tv shows and candian comedy that trys to be funny
[21:29] <Fleur> im french :/
[21:29] <Bodie> its silly because only like, 2% of australians are aboriginal
[21:29] <Eagle> because it's a horrible flavor
[21:29] <Fleur> well a french irish mutt
[21:29] <Fleur> but w/e
[21:29] <Ruska> canadian ketchup is delicious
[21:29] <coladash> yes it is
[21:29] <coladash> and bacon

[21:31] <Bodie> a pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes
[21:31] <Flotsam> I'd prefer {igs.

[21:32] <Flotsam> Oh, and why can't anyone except a select few people talk in the stream?
[21:32] <Norend> I don't think notch is comming back into IRC
[21:32] <Flotsam> There is only around 15 people in, it doesn't matter all too much.
[21:32] <Flotsam> And of course he is, silly.
[21:33] <Flotsam> He said he'd let the people he meets in IRC test survival multiplayer.
[21:33] <Balok> Why does my arrow keep appearing in the cross hair in indev mode?
[21:33] <Eagle> Did you know that pigs apparently shoot out fully cut steaks when you punch them enough
[21:34] <Norend> I see
[21:34] <Zaneo> Is that what you are making fun of? I'm sure there 100 other unrealistic things other then that. Not that we care, because it's a good game.
[21:34] <Zaneo> there are*
[21:34] <Eagle> What? I'm joking.
[21:35] <Eagle> It's just that the new channel topic is pigs
[21:35] * Flotsam (Mibbit@adsl-80-144-153.mcn.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[21:35] <Balok> Only four types of monsters?
[21:35] <Balok> There should be monsters that slowly eat away at blocks
[21:35] <Eagle> Nighttime would be horrible then
[21:36] <Eagle> you wouldn't be able to do anything useful but watch for holes breaking in your house
[21:36] <Malikat> if monsters ate blocks, they'd have to be super slow and super loud
[21:36] <Bodie> they could say
[21:36] <Bodie> OM NOM NOM NOM
[21:36] <Malikat> and they'd only eat if they knew you were there
[21:36] <Megatron> They should be able to break dirt/stone, anything you place should be unbreakable
[21:36] <whatdoestha> Monsters absolutely need to be more of a threat than "hide in house, slash at monster feet" all night.

[21:37] <Eagle> creepers explode
[21:37] <chazbothegr8_2> maybe monsters can kick?
[21:37] <Codlike> eventually that'll be true
[21:37] <Malikat> you'd hear a horrible grinding of the monster worm chewing away at your base

[21:37] <whatdoestha> Some of that's going to have to come from breaking walls down, some of it from passing through/over/around walls.
[21:37] <Eagle> spiders can slip under your little punching hole
[21:37] <Malikat> and you'd have to fight your way out

[21:37] <Cial> i still think that blocks should have an HP of sorts so that away when mobs are beating on your walls they would break them eventually
[21:37] <Norend> lol
[21:37] <Fleur> blah
[21:37] <Malikat> i think he said slimes would climb walls
[21:38] <coladash> I designed a l4d zombie
[21:38] <Fleur> cat or code mobs to shoot at walls
[21:38] <Codlike> cial: like they already do?
[21:38] <chazbothegr8_2> meh
[21:38] <Malikat> cial, notch has said that he wants the game to be more about controlling your environment than having monsters control it
[21:38] <whatdoestha> At the same time, there has to be a point to the monsters

[21:38] <cynicalAlchemist> I'm not sure why I have it on peaceful mode on infdev. Don't you respawn if you die in that?

[21:39] <Basic> If slimes can climb walls, I'd like to be able to do it too!

[21:39] <Cial> yes Codlike just to where the mobs can attack it, and yes yes but what good is "survival mode" when you can hide in a hut
[21:39] <Zaneo> in infdev you respawn no matter what
[21:39] <Zaneo> maybe you can make slime gloves with a durability that let you climb walls?

[23:17] <commie> when 95% of all walls will be stone and sand

[23:17] <AfroSammy> Skeletons seem to miss a lot as long as you strafe though.
[23:17] <commie> sword is a backup or good for zombies and creepers
[23:17] <commie> sand walls though are the best
[23:17] <TrueWolves> An Axe does the same damage as a sword, but costs 1 more metel to make
[23:18] <TrueWolves> But it also doubles for tree chopping
[23:18] <commie> axes break if you use them on mobs though
[23:18] <TrueWolves> true
[23:18] <commie> incorrect usage
[23:18] <AfroSammy> Axe breaks faster
[23:18] <TrueWolves> they do break faster

[23:18] <ExDee> axes take 2 more metal to make bro
[23:18] <Chibiace> I usually just use wood axes because usually I am not dealing with a lot of trees.
[23:18] <TrueWolves> Swords are the most efficent way for melee combat, but an axe can be used as well
[23:18] <commie> you can cut down ten trees and be good for ages
[23:18] <TrueWolves> Sword = 1 stick 2 metal, axe = 2 stick 3 metal
[23:18] <AfroSammy> No, Swords are two metal, Axe is three.
[23:18] <Marach-05> nope, 1
[23:18] <TrueWolves> that's only 1 more metal.

[23:31] <ExDee> what does gravel do anyways
[23:31] <ExDee> I find it on islands alot
[23:31] <AfroSammy> You get Flint from it, it acts as sand otherwise

[23:37] <TrueWolves> You can't make string from wool yet
[23:37] <TrueWolves> yet
[23:38] <Chibiace> well....then what's good about wool atm
[23:38] <Qizi> wool can make armor
[23:38] <FNugget> Chibiace: strong is from spiders
[23:38] <Wervyn> Crappy armor.
[23:38] <ExDee> Bad armor but armor
[23:39] <ExDee> but it's easy to find
[23:39] <Qizi> yeah, that way you don't have to waste iron on it
[23:39] <TrueWolves> you can make paintings with it
[23:39] <FNugget> wool can also make paintings.
[23:39] <ExDee> so it makes good temp. armor for people who recently find iron
[23:39] <FNugget> Chibiace: string* is from spiders
[23:39] <Chibiace> yeah, but at the time I posted that, I have no spiders currently.
[23:39] <Caleo> meh
[23:39] <Caleo> damn iron, I found a nice chunk with about 75 blocks but I haven't found any since

[23:41] <FNugget> it takes a while, but i'm pretty sure u can find it
[23:41] <Caleo> what do you guys do for mining?

[23:42] <Wervyn> I should check how much iron I still have sitting around in store room. And that after I used a bunch of it for picks.
[23:42] <OnyxFantasy> What is the first thing you make with your diamonds?

[23:43] <Caleo> what I do is drill a long 2x1 tunnel and punch a 1x1 hole 4 blocks deep every here and there off to the sides and top
[23:43] <FNugget> diamond tools arent worth it
[23:43] <rbos> Caleo - I drive a long horizontal shaft, then just drill sideshafts off it, spaced 3 apart.

[23:45] <rbos> caleo - long 2x1 ones, usually 5 or six iron picks long
[23:46] <Caleo> heh
[23:46] <rbos> then I run back and collect the torches, seal off the shaft, move 3 spots further down
[23:46] <rbos> and drill another one
