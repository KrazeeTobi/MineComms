[0:13] <Yourself> for some reason they thought it'd be fun to not put the save right before the boss, so each time you screw up, which will be frequently, you have to go through this whole fucking annoying area again
[0:13] <bildramer> "And the smell...dear god, the smell. A baby's diaper after force feeding it Indian food would have been a welcomed scent by comparison."

[0:14] <bildramer> unfortunately
[0:14] <bildramer> few avoid that
[0:14] <vurtual> half-life 2, save anywhere
[0:14] <bildramer> are the devs stupid or something?
[0:14] <vurtual> they find it funny
[0:14] <vurtual> Also, obligotory note that the devs get better at their own game as they make ti
[0:15] <vurtual> One of those doom epxansions was made by a guy who beat doom, and who kept ramping up the difficulty until he found it hard.
[0:15] <vurtual> intentionally making it ridiculous
[0:15] <Yourself> thanks to youtube, i learned a trick that would come in really handy
[0:15] <Yourself> there are damn shortcut keys for the songs
[0:15] <Yourself> which the game never tells you
[0:15] <LG_Legacy> http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7018659007 Thats pretty fucked up

[0:19] <Shadaez> vurtual it's a source multiplayer game on the newest engine, it's not TF2. DOD:S has the same thing.
[0:19] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.40.122) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:19] <vurtual> I'm joking

[0:21] <Yourself> god damn this is still bullshit
[0:22] <vurtual> acheivements include: 25 kills, inflict total 2,500 damage, earn 125,000 total cash, dominate someone, kill the entire opposing team without losing someone on your team
[0:22] <vurtual> kill an opponet you are already dominating
[0:22] <Yourself> turns out toward the end the boss just starts spamming giant energy balls that you can't dodge or reflect and 4 hits kill you
[0:22] <vurtual> "Rickrolled" "Win a round in less than 30 seconds (against at least 5 enemy players)"
[0:22] <vurtual> wat.

[0:28] <CruelNoise> i'm like a ps3!
[0:28] <CruelNoise> well, i ahve a few games
[0:28] <Yourself> the problem is these fucking energy balls don't have any discernable pattern
[0:28] * Adura (Adura@bas4-toronto21-2925011204.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:28] <Yourself> and there's no room to maneuver
[0:28] <Yourself> because there's spikes all over the walls and the water level randomly drops so you're stuck at the bottom
[0:28] * quaxar (crackalack@c-76-104-190-132.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:28] <vurtual> You can always play nogames with other PS3 owners, CruelNoise.
[0:29] <Yourself> because if you jump out of the water it'll launch you at an uncontrollable angle and speed and inevitably into one of the wall spikes
[0:29] <CruelNoise> i don't even own a ps3
[0:30] <vurtual> You ARE one
[0:30] <Yourself> now i see the way most people beat the boss is to do some lame exploit
[0:31] * Eythor (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:31] <CruelNoise> oh, so ps3 owners can play nogaems ON me
[0:31] <CruelNoise> ew
[0:31] <Yourself> and i'm not swimming through this god damn area just to get to him again
[0:32] <AzureAngelic> wait
[0:32] <AzureAngelic> counter strike source beta?
[0:32] <AzureAngelic> isn't it already out? O_o
[0:32] <AzureAngelic> oh wait the update
[0:32] <AzureAngelic> nvm
[0:33] <vurtual> It's reminding me of AA3, with all the achievements and realism
[0:33] <vurtual> well it's ons team, I'm not putting out money to install it
[0:33] <vurtual> and it has achievements and a realistic-looking guy holding a gun.
[0:34] <AzureAngelic> i didnt even know there was a beta lol
[0:35] * Inside (Gary@cpe-68-203-187-210.satx.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:37] <Yourself> i like that google chrome loads fast
[0:37] <Yourself> but i can't stand its address bar
[0:37] <Yourself> because i can't seem to train it to do what i want
[0:38] <Yourself> because apparently it matches against the domain name first
[0:38] <Yourself> and there's no way to get it to identify a website by what comes after the domain name
[0:38] <Yourself> and it doesn't appear to sort by the number of visits
[0:38] <Yourself> firefox's address bar is definitely a hell of a lot better
[0:39] <Inside> anyone know what the technique is behind detecting the "cheat detected: distance" business?
[0:40] <AzureAngelic> huh?
[0:41] <Yourself> usually it's because you created or destroyed a block that's too far away from you
[0:41] <Inside> well, I'm trying to write a bot for minecraft that draws numbers (like.. say for a digitial watch) and then erases the tiles and redraws them every second or so
[0:41] <Inside> I'm just trying to figure out what the delay is before moving and destroying a block so that my bot doesn't get kicked D:
[0:42] <LG_Legacy> Why would you want to create one in the first place?
[0:42] <Inside> for fun?
[0:42] * Iguana (Iguana@CPE002191dd1c8e-CM00111ae61624.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:42] <Inside> why does anyone program recreationally.
[0:43] <Yourself> well, mnkrft has to limit itself to 10 blocks/second, but there's no delay between it sending its movement packet and placing a block
[0:43] <CruelNoise> usually for a purpouse
[0:43] <Inside> well, I'm doing it for knowledge. I want to write my own MORPG and so I wrote a dummy minecraft client and then I'm thinking of writing a minecraft server.
[0:44] <Inside> Yourself: Hmm, I see. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
[0:44] <Yourself> at least not that i know of
[0:44] <Yourself> you'd have to ask lep
[0:44] <Yourself> and then hope he's willing to tell you
[0:45] <Inside> okie doke.
[0:45] <Inside> lep lep lep
[0:45] <Inside> there, said it three times :D maybe he'll appear!
[0:45] * Inf3rnal (Mibbit@rrcs-97-78-127-198.se.biz.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:45] <Inside> who is lep? does he code for minecraft or..?
[0:46] <Yourself> he made the bot that runs on chariot's server
[0:46] <Inside> ah, I see.
[0:46] <Inside> that's...
[0:46] <Inf3rnal> Still waiting on premium membership...
[0:46] <Inf3rnal> D:
[0:47] <Inf3rnal> I bought it on paypal on the 2nd of May...
[0:47] <Inside> whoa
[0:47] <Inf3rnal> I have emailed Notch and also tweeted him but no response.
[0:48] <Inf3rnal> =\
[0:48] <bildramer> FUCK NO: "experts believe a blast of ultrasound to the testes can safely stop sperm production for six months."
[0:48] <bildramer> lol news
[0:48] <bildramer> we're screwed
[0:48] <Inf3rnal> LOL
[0:49] <CruelNoise> stops production, then you just have to fap three times a day for a week to get out what's already in there
[0:50] <Inf3rnal> xD
[0:50] * Bidoof_King (Bidoof_Kin@174-154-102-84.pools.spcsdns.net) Quit (Quit: Tending to the Bidoof War Issue.)
[0:50] <Inf3rnal> Pretty much

[0:51] <CruelNoise> how goes it?
[0:51] <CruelNoise> brb
[0:51] <CruelNoise> and why would jolly ranchers be contraband?
[0:53] <Inf3rnal> stupid shit as aways.
[0:53] <Yourself> because it's a link to fox news, bildramer
[0:53] <Inf3rnal> Schools are always like that. =D
[0:53] <bildramer> :/
[0:53] <bildramer> http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=360 lol at compression
[0:53] * Maart3h (m-m-s@86.92.114.65) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:54] <Yourself> But school officials are standing by the punishment. They say they have to be strict in order to enforce their no-gum, no-candy policy. Candy and gum, they say, can cause a mess.
[0:54] <Yourself> i wonder what they hire janitors for
[0:54] <Inf3rnal> ugh 12-tap interpolation

[0:56] <bildramer> so it's back up
[0:58] <Inside> dunking your junk in 115F water for 45 minutes renders you sterile for 5 months, I hear
[0:58] <Yourself> could just use a laptop
[0:58] <Inside> or that

[0:59] <bildramer> epic twitter bug
[0:59] <bildramer> I could e.g. tweet "accept bildramer"
[0:59] <bildramer> then everyone would follow me

[1:06] * Bomb_Spammer (chatzilla@S01060014bff3f045.ss.shawcable.net) has joined #minecraft
[1:07] <Visiiri> The only problem prime 2 has, IMO, is the open - ended style gameplay's mixture with the maze-like corrodors make it difficult to play, and that's not supposed to be the hard part.
[1:07] <vurtual> I can use the darkburst(30 rounds per shot), then pick up the light ammo I get, shoot some boxes, and have MORE DARK AMMO THAN BEFORE.
[1:07] <bildramer> I wonder how we'll convert to IPv6
[1:07] * gear1 (Administra@72.46.227.30) has left #minecraft
[1:08] <bildramer> for 10 minutes all the internet goes down, then back up?
[1:08] <bildramer> :l
[1:08] <Yourself> good question
[1:08] <bildramer> well, I wonder how a whole ISP could switch
[1:08] <vurtual> yes it is
[1:08] <vurtual> the maze-like metroid worlds are one of the things metroid games are known for!
[1:08] <Visiiri> Mine does that too sometimes
[1:09] <vurtual> It's why we complained about fusion!
[1:09] <Visiiri> Well, maze-like is fine
[1:09] <Visiiri> Prime is a good example.
[1:09] <CruelNoise> i cannot wait for the other m
[1:09] <Visiiri> The maze isn't supposed to be the hard part about the game, however.

[1:13] <Naserve> GTA4
[1:13] <Visiiri> K, first
[1:14] <Visiiri> I think that horses is actually a good idea.
[1:14] <Visiiri> If made correctly.
[1:14] <Visiiri> I think that while riding, your saddle should get damaged and at some point break, the horse bucks you off if you don't dismount first.
[1:14] <Visiiri> comma fail
[1:14] * TrueWolves writes up interview questions. @.@
[1:15] <Visiiri> Other than that, there's not much
[1:15] <TrueWolves> Dommys! ya there?

[1:15] <Dommys> Ayup

[1:49] <vurtual> interview question him about that

[1:49] <TrueWolves> If you want I can ask him about that
[1:50] <TrueWolves> What do you need to know?
[1:50] <Animator> Yes. In fact, ask him if he's gotten an e-mail from a man named Animator about certain IRC rules.
[1:50] <Animator> Preferably modifying them to a modern-day form.
[1:50] <TrueWolves> ... that be particularly suspific...

[3:11] <LuciferZ> Illustrator, lol.
[3:11] <LuciferZ> I know nothing about InDesign, but I have it.

[3:12] <LuciferZ> That's an amazing idea.
[3:12] <vurtual> Just get a big bin of basic shapes, and then a smaller bin, for overworlds. Quickly assemble together a layout of a map, then make more intricate models of a specific part if needed.
[3:14] <Animator> Get some lego people and you'll have a Machinima.

[3:20] <revenant> vurtual, that would be neat
[3:20] <Malikat> but my mouse was visible and moving and i could use it
[3:20] <revenant> I have a bunch of big grey floor panels for stuff like that
[3:21] <Naxza> Last week's planned Doom session on Friday. Did that ever get off the ground?
[3:21] <Malikat> and it wasn't the keyboard, because holding down the opposite directional look key just made it slower
[3:21] <Malikat> D:
[3:22] <Malikat> also has anyone noticed that google's search results have become more retarded lately?
[3:22] <vede> SDL's pissin' me off.
[3:23] <Malikat> google has been developing a tendency to completely ignore some of my search terms
[3:23] <Malikat> kind of like how bing always has
[3:23] <Shadaez> what are you talking about
[3:23] <Malikat> i searched for "apb camera won't stop spinning" and the top result is about a web cam that won't turn off
[3:24] <vede> Google's results page is all squished now. What the shit.
[3:24] <Malikat> it's like google was like "OH MY GOD CAMERA? IGNORE ALL THE OTHER TERMS"
[3:24] <vurtual> ok I have finished my design of a map.
[3:24] <Malikat> kind of like how bing always has done
[3:25] <vurtual> search all points bulletin
[3:26] <vurtual> It's of a valley, which has a hill, that has a two-level bunker(with metroidy elevators, that'll probably make NPC work hard), a small rail system for loading a tall rocket tower(at one end of the valley), helipad, second base you can reach.
[3:26] <vurtual> Now to make this.

[3:34] <vurtual> lung complications
[3:34] <Hunter712> lies
[3:34] <vurtual> someone says he got shot.
[3:34] <Hunter712> link
[3:34] <Hunter712> blatant lies
[3:34] <CrazySpai> vurtual is just a troll, ignore him
[3:34] <vurtual> revenant can confirm this
[3:34] <Hunter712> ./ignore
[3:34] <Malikat> i will say one thing about APB
[3:34] <CrazySpai> It's fracking awesome?
[3:34] <Hunter712> its going to fail
[3:35] <Hunter712> hardcore
[3:35] <revenant> Notch was shot in the lung, and upon removal of the bullet, it was discovered he had malignant lung cancer.
[3:35] <Miclee> It's going to fail at start because it's not ready to be released.
[3:35] <Malikat> i am proud that i managed to shoot a civilian at ~25 feet away while my camera refused to stop spinning
[3:35] <Miclee> Needs more polish.
[3:35] <Malikat> i'm trying not to feel sick
[3:35] <Malikat> i tried for five minutes to try to figure out why the camera would not fucking stop spinning
[3:36] <Malikat> the mouse responded, and the keyboard look only slowed it down
[3:36] <vurtual> are you holding a button down?
[3:36] <Hunter712> i like how in the beginning, they said there weren't going to be any subscriptions
[3:36] <Hunter712> but now
[3:36] <Malikat> vurtual: no
[3:36] <LuciferZ> Find out what key controls rotation, then try to change it to something else.
[3:36] <Hunter712> we're going to have to pay subs
[3:36] <vurtual> on your keyboard
[3:36] <vurtual> is there a jammed arrow/num?
[3:36] <Malikat> LuciferZ: first thing i tried
[3:36] <Malikat> vurtual: no
[3:36] <LuciferZ> And changing it didn't affect it?
[3:36] <Malikat> i tried pressing the opposite direction
[3:37] <Malikat> LuciferZ: correct
[3:37] <vurtual> unplug your keyboard
[3:37] <vurtual> and try again
[3:37] <Malikat> pressing the opposite direction, if it were a jammed key, would cancel out the spin
[3:37] <LuciferZ> Are you using a tablet mouse, or some kind of special mouse
[3:37] <LuciferZ> ?
[3:37] <vurtual> not all games do that
[3:37] <Malikat> i am using a trackball
[3:37] <LuciferZ> Try using something besides a trackball
[3:38] <Malikat> i don't have anything besides a trackball. :|
[3:38] <LuciferZ> Try unplugging/disconnecting it then
[3:38] <LuciferZ> See if it stops.
[3:38] <Malikat> it works completely fine for everything else
[3:38] <vurtual> TRY IT
[3:38] <vurtual> trackballs suck btw
[3:38] <Malikat> i was just playing TF2 with no errors
[3:38] <vurtual> They suck themselves.
[3:38] <LuciferZ> Ja, try it anyways
[3:38] <Malikat> not this kind, this kind is pretty nice

[3:39] <Malikat> i will.

[3:39] <Naxza> One can't instantly change their mouse, yeah.

[3:39] <vurtual> done

[5:23] <Dudebro> Lol
[5:23] <vurtual> However, there has to be a place for the tracks to fit, which is logically the wall opposite the one you came in.
[5:23] <AzureAngelic> on either side?
[5:23] <vurtual> So you have to... somehow phase through the wall or something, because the track is there.
[5:23] <AzureAngelic> above it?
[5:23] <Dudebro> Break it down
[5:23] <Calhoun> You still have 4 sides.
[5:24] <vurtual> Yeah, except it only touches on that one side.
[5:24] <Calhoun> Well then, You've got some bad design!
[5:24] <vurtual> and it's meant to be wide.
[5:24] <AzureAngelic> obviously there's a tame brontosaurus below it lifting it up
[5:24] <vurtual> there's only two sides to fit tracks, too.
[5:24] <vurtual> the other side has a partially outcropping part of floor, and a lowering security walkway, just so the walls can reach it.
[5:25] <Kodaichi> ww
[5:25] <Schettzofren> you still legoing?
[5:25] <vurtual> This is partially because of the lego design I have here.
[5:26] <Kodaichi> Notch's 3-day old blog post is so tl;dr and full of code that I don't even wat to touch it/
[5:26] <Kodaichi> Is it actually worth reading?
[5:26] <Calhoun> vurtual: Couldn't you just, narrow the door opening? Put the rails on the ends of the side.
[5:26] <Calhoun> Kodaichi: It's good read, if you know what he's talking about.
[5:27] <vurtual> Although that'd work, it'd be a bit different than how it is traditionally done in this setting, and the doorway is a big hall.

[5:27] <Smoo> why do people expect me to not be an asshole?
[5:28] <Calhoun> Smoo: Why are you being an asshole?
[5:28] <vurtual> Because Smoo is a friendly name.

[5:28] <Calhoun> It's not kind?
[5:28] <Rooster> It's so fun to say
[5:28] <Smoo> *owl9
[5:28] <Yourself> but it's fun
[5:28] <Rooster> Let's see the thread
[5:28] <Arrrmand> Uh, I have a problem - the minecraft site seems to have forgotten that I've paid for the game
[5:28] <Rooster> I want some internet drama
[5:28] <Calhoun> It's only fun to be an asshole to someone who was an asshole first
[5:28] <Smoo> oh hell, just look at nebbs post history
[5:29] <Calhoun> otherwise, it kinda makes you look like a dick
[5:29] <Rooster> He's probably like 10 years old
[5:29] <Rooster> This community seems to get a younger and younger fan base
[5:29] <Smoo> then he should shut up and lurk

[5:29] <Smoo> hell, i use long words when they mean what i want to say
[5:29] <Calhoun> this is why i don't go on the minecraft forums. it's like 80% kids.
[5:30] <Smoo> he can't even capitalize or proofread
[5:30] <Kodaichi> okay
[5:30] <vurtual> I rarely proofread.
[5:30] <Kodaichi> I read notch's blog post
[5:30] <Smoo> and even that, i could deal with
[5:30] <vurtual> I just type everything perfectly on the spot.
[5:30] <Arrrmand> ...any ideas?
[5:30] <Kodaichi> why the heck would he figure we would want to know that?!
[5:30] <vurtual> Arrrmand, do you have a skin?
[5:30] <Smoo> but he's incomprehensible, even if you correct the grammar

[5:30] <Kodaichi> sure its nice but it MEANS NOTHING TO US
[5:31] <Calhoun> Kodaichi: It means that he is working, and working for efficiency.
[5:31] <vurtual> I got this silly idea
[5:31] <Kodaichi> :/
[5:31] <vurtual> what if I put the rails OVER the entrance, as mounted rails?
[5:31] <Rooster> Fuck a goat?
[5:31] <Kodaichi> still.
[5:31] <AzureAngelic> god damnit tf2 keeps crashing
[5:31] * vurtual tries it
[5:31] <AzureAngelic> ugh
[5:31] <Calhoun> IF it works, it works.
[5:32] <Kodaichi> why release only small parts of your source code? T_T
[5:32] <Rooster> More words of wisdom from Calhoun
[5:32] <Arrrmand> vurtual: What does having a skin have to do with it though?
[5:32] <AzureAngelic> <Rooster>: Fuck a goat?
[5:32] <AzureAngelic> <vurtual> tries it
[5:32] <AzureAngelic> wat
[5:32] <Yourself> <Kodaichi> why the heck would he figure we would want to know that?!
[5:32] <Rooster> Yes
[5:32] <Yourself> it's more that that's a part he finds interesting and wanted to share
[5:33] <Kodaichi> I'm more annoyed just that he released a small chunk of his source code
[5:33] <Yourself> i still had a question about the particular design he chose, though
[5:33] * Smoo (Smoo@cpe-67-240-72-99.nycap.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[5:33] <Yourself> from what's in the post it seems like he could do better than what he posted
[5:33] <Yourself> at least that's the view i have coming from a C++ background
[5:33] * rcfighter (rcfighter@c-69-138-73-173.hsd1.md.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: (???_???)??? [x])
[5:33] <Kodaichi> yeah
[5:33] <Yourself> he's using java generics, which are the analog to C++'s templates
[5:34] <Yourself> which are an immensely powerful component of C++
[5:34] <Kodaichi> It kinda lookes like he'd be better off with a library structure, rather than a whole bunch of if statements
[5:34] <Yourself> and are capable of performing all sorts of neat compile-time optimizations that don't muddy up the design of the application
[5:34] <Visiiri> :D
[5:34] <Visiiri> I'm pleased
[5:34] <Visiiri> I was just at a group-meeting sort of deal for my school next year.
[5:34] <Yourself> well, my question is what the hash map is all about
[5:34] * DimJim (chatzilla@cpe-24-242-36-94.hot.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: no)
[5:34] <Yourself> these renderers don't seem to have any sort of persistent state
[5:34] <Rooster> Is Dwarf Fortress fun?
[5:35] <Visiiri> It's a very nice place, of course.
[5:35] <Visiiri> Probably the best tech school in the state.
[5:35] <Yourself> so it seems unnecessary to be using a hash map to do a runtim look up on these instances
[5:35] <Calhoun> Rooster: once you get past the Learning Cliff. Hell yes.
[5:35] <Rooster> I heard it's just ASCII
[5:35] <Yourself> runtime*
[5:35] <Calhoun> It is, but you can get tilesets.
[5:35] <Visiiri> Rooster: That made me not play it aswell
[5:35] <Yourself> in C++ this is where template specialization would come in
[5:35] <Annihilator> you must find losing fun
[5:35] <Yourself> then the look-up is done statically at compile rather than at runtime
[5:35] <Visiiri> everything web-design and application is what I"m going to be learning
[5:35] <Calhoun> In DF how can losing ever be not fun?
[5:35] <Rooster> Exactly, wait until it gets a good...afdsdfa....
[5:35] <vurtual> huuurrr, valve made an elevator facing the same issue
[5:35] <vurtual> so I can just look at that!
[5:35] <Visiiri> And then, me Senior year, I get to learn Java
[5:36] <Visiiri> ...all year long...
[5:36] <Visiiri> I met a guy there that's been programming quite a while too.
[5:36] <Yourself> it can reduce memory usage and increase speed since the proper classes are just inserted directly into the code as if you had written them that way
[5:36] <Visiiri> Quite good to know that it's not just a bunch of hardcore gamers
[5:36] <vurtual> I think I have a poor sense of bass-boom.
[5:36] <vurtual> that or I need more subwoof.
[5:36] <vurtual> trying to listen to a song, and like another earlier, it's too low-boomy
[5:37] <vurtual> so it doesn't feel loud or musicy at all
[5:37] <Calhoun> I have a killer Bass, but the actual sound quality from my speakers is piss-poor.
[5:37] * Arrrmand (Mibbit@dyn63-459.yok.fi) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[5:37] <vurtual> my laptop has a subwoof
[5:37] <Kodaichi> what I really want to ask notch is how he renders the water and lava.
[5:37] <Kodaichi> and why I can't seem to figure out how to change them
[5:39] <vede> Kodaichi, the water, lava, and fire textures are all procedurally generated.
[5:39] <Rooster> SubWOOOOOOFER
[5:39] <Kodaichi> THOUGHT SO.
[5:39] <Rooster> You have to say it like that
[5:39] <vurtual> it just... hovers on the arils
[5:40] <vede> The textures in terrain.png and such are unused, basically.
[5:40] <Rooster> Sub/WOOOOOOOFer/
[5:40] <Yourself> probably a straightforward perlin noise implementation
[5:40] * E- (Mibbit@c-68-33-53-25.hsd1.md.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[5:40] <Kodaichi> man. There's got to be some way to hex edit it :(
[5:40] <Yourself> well, there's always some sort of filter applied to perlin noise
[5:40] <vurtual> testing subwoof but lower quality speakers
[5:40] <Kodaichi> If he uses color values, we can change then
[5:40] <vurtual> it is awesome?
[5:41] <Yourself> or change how they're computed
[5:41] <Kodaichi> that's tougher
[5:41] <vede> Kodaichi, he's expressed interest in moving away from the proc-gen so all the texture-packs out there can actually be complete, since he really likes seeing what people can do with the textures.
[5:41] <Kodaichi> ._.
[5:41] <vede> Next time you see him you should badger him about it. :D
[5:42] <Kodaichi> vede: :D awesome
[5:42] <Yourself> maybe he should add hooks into the procedural generation so people can tap that too :P
[5:42] <Kodaichi> I already basically made my dreams come true with my Sunset Hills mod
[5:42] <Yourself> plugins would be pretty wild
[5:42] <Kodaichi> its just the damn water. ITs TOO BLUE
[5:42] <Yourself> i just really hope there will be server plugins

[5:43] <Kodaichi> yeah.
[5:43] <Yourself> as long as there's a decent plugin implementation most custom server projects will just stop
[5:43] <Yourself> because they won't be needed
[5:43] * Vgor (Clay@pool-96-231-133-237.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:43] <Kodaichi> Servers can send out 128KB png's no problem
[5:43] <Kodaichi> just look at TheOne's zombie server.
[5:44] <vurtual> server plugins that can make changes of the client
[5:44] <vurtual> new HUD, new low-res models being shown.
[5:44] <vurtual> firstperson weapon models.
[5:44] <vurtual> The ability to assign custom button presses, so you could essentially create counter-strike in minecraft.
[5:45] <Visiiri> K guize
[5:45] <Visiiri> I'm going to code a new autoclicker
[5:45] <Malikat> okay
[5:45] <Visiiri> Should I use C++, VB, or C#
[5:45] <vurtual> make it do burst clicking
[5:45] <LuciferZ> Please include right click as well this time.
[5:45] <vurtual> firemodes
[5:45] <Visiiri> Sure
[5:45] <vurtual> hit mouse3 to switch firemodes
[5:45] <Visiiri> no
[5:45] <Malikat> once i stopped spinning in circles, APB is an entertaining sort of thing
[5:45] <Visiiri> Insert
[5:45] <vurtual> semi-auto, full auto, and burst.
[5:45] <vurtual> and click-in-tune-with-midi
[5:46] <Visiiri> Err, semi-auto is normal, right?
[5:46] <Visiiri> And no midi, sorry
[5:46] <Malikat> it's totally not a game i'd be like "YEAH GREAT GAME" but it's fun to shoot people
[5:46] <Visiiri> Shouldn't be hard.
[5:46] <Visiiri> How many clicks for burst?
[5:46] <Lep> wasn't your like autoclicker made in autohotkey
[5:46] <Visiiri> Three or five?
[5:46] <vurtual> semi auto as in no matter how long you hold, it clicks.
[5:46] <vurtual> 3.
[5:46] <Lep> -ike+ast wtf
[5:46] <Visiiri> vurtual: Errm whut
[5:46] <Visiiri> What would automatic be then?
[5:46] <Visiiri> Without holding?
[5:47] <vurtual> hold and it clicks very rapidly.
[5:47] <Visiiri> Semi is slower paced?
[5:47] <Malikat> rofl
[5:47] <Malikat> no, semi is single shot
[5:47] <Visiiri> <vurtual> semi auto as in no matter how long you hold, it clicks.
[5:47] <Visiiri> 'clicks' is plural.
[5:47] <Malikat> it's sort of automatic in that you don't need to recock a hammer or clear a round
[5:47] <Visiiri> Yeah, that's what I though.
[5:47] <Visiiri> *thought
[5:47] <Visiiri> I just misread vurtual's line.
[5:47] <Malikat> automatic you don't even have to pull the trigger again
[5:47] <Visiiri> [I'm a dumbass :)]
[5:48] <Malikat> burst is limited automatic
[5:48] <Visiiri> Yeah, I know burst.
[5:48] <Visiiri> :P

[5:49] <Lep> you can decompile that?
[5:50] <vurtual> imagine having a computer-controlled machine gun with computerized firemodes
[5:50] <Lep> it's like one line
[5:50] <vurtual> then making it fire to the tune of a midi.
[5:50] <Visiiri> Can you?
[5:50] <Lep> I actually changed it for my mexicans

[6:04] <vurtual> taskbar sucks amirite
[6:04] <revenant> WHY THE F*** DIDN'T THEY DO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE :|
[6:04] <Calhoun> Taskbar kicks ASS once you get used to it.
[6:04] <revenant> (for most stuff)
[6:04] <vurtual> no it does not
[6:04] <revenant> I'm going to have to agree with Calhoun.
[6:04] <vurtual> it's like having too many tabs open
[6:05] <revenant> The draggy-up motion is fun
[6:05] <revenant> well vurtual, i'm a mac user, so its fine for me
[6:05] <vurtual> haha mac user
[6:05] <vurtual> I do not like these "intuitive" rubber-interfaces.
[6:05] <revenant> I just need to learn ALL RELEVANT KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
[6:05] <Rooster> Ok Justice League intro is bad, but Justice League Unlimited is the shit
[6:05] <revenant> I prefer to use the mouse as little as possible > >
[6:05] <revenant> But Calhoun
[6:05] <revenant> the drag up thing is fun :P
[6:06] <revenant> I need to install Boot Camp drivers and such now > >
[6:06] <revenant> I had a royal good time getting this installed without a disc drive :D
[6:06] <revenant> It involved Parallels, dd, boot sectors, and PAIN.
[6:06] <Calhoun> Hah
[6:06] <Calhoun> I'll bet
[6:06] <revenant> Since, I CANT BOOT FROM USB
[6:06] <vurtual> my favorite thing about ubuntu is that I could throw up all my important icons like processor use(which is getting high now), the extended time, the off/lock button, sound control and power and laptop brightness at the top-left
[6:06] <vurtual> er, top-right
[6:06] <revenant> So I had to do an install without USB, IEEE1394, CD/DVD
[6:06] <vurtual> the startmenu thingy at the top left, as well as any shortcuts if I REALLY need them
[6:06] <revenant> Yep, I like those two vurtual.
[6:06] <vurtual> then the windowy taskbar down at the bottom.
[6:07] <revenant> I was dual booter
[6:07] <revenant> now I'm triple
[6:07] <revenant> (for an internship I need windows)
[6:07] <revenant> I use Linux Mint
[6:07] <revenant> but hey, it's the same as ubuntu ;)
[6:07] <vurtual> I like simple interfaces.
[6:07] <revenant> ?
[6:07] <revenant> I like "interfaces that make sense"
[6:07] <revenant> for example, photoshops interface is by no means simple
[6:07] * Dae is now known as AFK|Dae
[6:07] <vurtual> no shiny, except maybe a shaded-effect maybe, everything conveyed through taskbar icon brightness/flashing/state, simple visual cues
[6:07] <revenant> but it still makes sense for the most part
[6:08] <revenant> one of those kind of things I really like
[6:08] <revenant> is in Mac OS X

[6:09] * vurtual gets angry
[6:09] <Zuggy> I haven't really run into many creepers.
[6:09] <Yourself> hey, lep, what do you think of minecraft clans?
[6:10] <revenant> >:D
[6:10] <vurtual> my favorite user interface, to this day, has been hammer's.
[6:10] <revenant> I CAUGHT JIRACHI IN POKEMON PINBALL RS
[6:10] <revenant> AAAAAAND THERE'S REGIROCK
[6:10] <Zuggy> I found a shit ton of skeleton archers in this cave I jsut finished cleaning out though.
[6:10] <revenant> Only a few more legendaries left > >
[6:10] <revenant> God damn rayquaza is a pain in the arse.
[6:10] <Zuggy> Cave right next to my starting house, went all the way down to the bottom, loads of lava pools.
[6:10] <Calhoun> Hammer has a pretty good interface. It's not overly clunky. Unlike so many other similar programs.
[6:10] <Zuggy> I found 15 diamonds.
[6:10] <vurtual> One vastly different, square icon for each tool on the left, a seperately-laid-out part of the right side for each function(entities, textures, visgroups, selection), and then a line of icons for things like grids and such.
[6:11] <Zuggy> Actually 18 diamionds.
[6:11] <revenant> I do like Mac OS X as an OS
[6:11] <revenant> beyond the computers (overpriced)
[6:11] <revenant> the operating system is much more solid
[6:11] <Dudebro> Same
[6:11] <revenant> Windows 7 is a definite improvement, like 2000->XP
[6:11] <revenant> but it's not quite as solid imo.
[6:11] <Dudebro> I just can't stand the lack of games.
[6:11] <revenant> So far at least.
[6:11] <Calhoun> revenant: I've had no issues with it.
[6:11] <revenant> besides, I have a long standing hatred towards DOS.
[6:12] <vurtual> I don't like new interfaces much, if only because I'm addicted to the subconscious actions I can do-WHY CAN'T I STOP BLINKING
[6:12] <vurtual> I AM BLINKING AT LEAST PARTIALLY IN TUNE WITH A SONG IN MY HEAD WHAT IS GOING ON FFFF
[6:12] <revenant> I need my smoothed mouse acceleration!
[6:12] <revenant> >:(
[6:12] <revenant> INSTALL FASTER DRIVERS
[6:12] <vurtual> I have to hold my eyes open
[6:12] <revenant> I NEED MY SMOOTHED MOUSE ACCELERATION AND GRAPHICS DRIVERS :\
[6:12] <vede> Okay, what the goddamn shit.
[6:12] * revenant is now known as vidi
[6:12] * vidi whistles innocently
[6:13] * vidi is now known as revenant
[6:13] <Calhoun> Smoothed mouse acceleration? I can't stand it.
[6:13] <vurtual> I know a guy called vidi
[6:13] <Calhoun> I always overshoot
[6:13] <vurtual> you do not want to be the guy
[6:13] <revenant> Well, I never overshoot
[6:13] <revenant> I need high sensitivity
[6:13] <vurtual> okay which thing is the
[6:13] <vurtual> tihs*
[6:13] <vurtual> where the faster your mouse moves in a distance, the farther the cursor goes, or the lack of that?
[6:13] <revenant> if it takes more than one movement to get anywhere on the screen...
[6:13] <revenant> its not good enough
[6:13] <vede> if(thisisabool){cout << "TRUE\n";}else{cout << "FALSE\n";}
[6:13] <revenant> vurtual, that but smoothed out and smart
[6:14] <revenant> so its on a curve, not just linear acceleration
[6:14] <vede> That should ALWAYS print either TRUE or FALSE, correct?
[6:14] <vurtual> I like my mice nice and linear.
[6:14] <vurtual> vede, what did it print?
[6:14] <revenant> vede
[6:14] <vede> Nothing at all.
[6:14] <revenant> what language
[6:14] <vede> C++
[6:14] <revenant> if thisisabool is NULL...
[6:14] <vurtual> it must be bad
[6:14] <revenant> well NULL in C++ is considered False
[6:14] <vede> Exactly.
[6:14] <revenant> odd
[6:14] <revenant> I don't like C++ much.
[6:14] <revenant> I love C
[6:14] <vede> I can't think of a case where that piece of code will not print anything.
[6:14] <vurtual> try doing the cout parts individually
[6:14] <revenant> dearly.
[6:14] <vurtual> outside of the IF
[6:14] <revenant> print the value of thisisabool
[6:14] <vede> vurtual, it worked outside of the if statements.
[6:14] <revenant> oh!
[6:14] <Yourself> paste more code
[6:14] <revenant> vede
[6:15] <revenant> lol
[6:15] <Yourself> like all of it
[6:15] <revenant> BOOL in c++ is a typedef'd enum or int?
[6:15] <revenant> if it was an int it could have a value like 3
[6:15] <Yourself> and shoot yourself for putting using namespace std; in
[6:15] * lighthazard (lighthazar@ool-4a58b681.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #minecraft
[6:15] <revenant> yes please do
[6:15] <vede> What's so wrong with that?
[6:15] <vurtual> using namespace kitty!
[6:15] <revenant> I actually like using std::string
[6:15] <Yourself> defeats the purpose of namespaces
[6:15] <revenant> it looks prettier
[6:15] <vede> I see people saying that all over, but I never see any reasoning behind it.
[6:16] <Yourself> do using std::cout;
[6:16] <Yourself> if you really don't want to type std::
[6:16] <vurtual> main?? { cout << "You're a kitty!"! return ":3"! }
[6:17] <Skillkills> C++ makes no god damn sense to me
[6:17] <Skillkills> I prefer java
[6:17] <Yourself> wow...that's backwards
[6:18] <revenant> Yeah.
[6:18] <revenant> Seriously?
[6:18] <revenant> I like Python, C, Obj-C, Ruby and occasionally Brainfuck.
[6:18] <vurtual> python is fun
[6:18] <vurtual> but the whole no-{} thing is jarring
[6:18] <vurtual> all my preconcieved notions about a programming language are always wrnog
[6:19] * Scrippy (Scrippy@129.2.141.1) has joined #minecraft
[6:19] <Yourself> anyway, vede, post more code on a pastebin or something
[6:19] <vurtual> C++ I always imagine code so rigid, that obscure things like << and >> and if() {} not being there.
[6:19] <revenant> C++ is just overcomplicated
[6:19] <revenant> Pure C is more fun.
[6:19] <vurtual> lua is the only thing that actually makes sense to me now
[6:19] <revenant> and >>, <<, and {} are not obscure!
[6:19] <vurtual> if() {}
[6:19] <revenant> << and >> are overloaded operators
[6:19] <vurtual> these things that seem to... defy a rigid pattern
[6:19] <Yourself> that if statement will always print something regardless of the value of the variable
[6:19] <revenant> if() only works for a single scope
[6:19] <vurtual> I don't want OPERATORS IN MY CODE DIRECTLY SIR
[6:19] <Yourself> unless something is broken somewhere else
[6:19] <revenant> using {} extends a scope to multiple lines.
[6:20] <vurtual> I want something like a KIND OF FUNCTION FOR EVERYTHING
[6:20] <Yourself> i've had memory leaks that have broken printing before
[6:20] <Yourself> in completely different parts of the code
[6:20] <revenant> argh
[6:20] <revenant> I cannot right click
[6:20] <revenant> I need ONE right click
[6:20] <vurtual> lol mac
[6:20] <Calhoun> Heh
[6:20] <vurtual> HIT COMMAND MOUSE
[6:20] <Scrippy> bluh bluh code bluh
[6:20] <revenant> nope, vurtual, no driver for that
[6:21] <revenant> I need my USB mouse > >...
[6:21] <vurtual> GET A PROPER MOUSE YEAH?
[6:21] <revenant> I have 3
[6:21] <vurtual> GO GET IT
[6:21] <revenant> THE WIRE IS TANGLED

[6:21] <vede> Herpderp I feel dumb.
[6:21] <revenant> I kid you not, my drawer is actually spaghetti
[6:21] <revenant> it looks like a giant black spaghetti mass
[6:22] <Visiiri> Lolwin
[6:22] <Yourself> what'd you do?
[6:22] <Visiiri> I made it burst
[6:22] <Visiiri> But it fucks up any batch files open
[6:22] <Calhoun> I could go for some spaghetti right now. I'm starving.
[6:22] <Visiiri> that means it's a no go
[6:22] <vurtual> if({foo<32},{printf("HURPHDURRRF");});
[6:22] <vurtual> how reasonable is this
[6:22] * Zuggy (Mibbit@c-98-215-153-178.hsd1.il.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[6:22] <Visiiri> What is 'foo' defining?
[6:23] <vurtual> foo is an integer
[6:23] <revenant> whee right clik
[6:23] <Visiiri> Where is the integer picked up from?
[6:23] <Visiiri> o.o
[6:23] <vede> That was in a for loop, that looked like this: "for(int i;i<323;i++){thatcode}"
[6:23] <vurtual> that's not the important part
[6:23] <Visiiri> :P
[6:23] <vurtual> earlier, foo was defined somewhere
[6:23] <vede> Forgot to set i to 0.
[6:23] <Yourself> ++i
[6:24] <Scrippy> Hey y'all does anybody know when notch is usually on?
[6:24] <revenant> god DAMMIT
[6:24] <Visiiri> if (owner():keyAttack2() == 1) {
[6:24] <Visiiri> ?
[6:24] <vurtual> Scrippy soon
[6:24] <vede> Why ++i in for loops?
[6:24] <Scrippy> I still want to pick his brain.
[6:24] <Visiiri> No, that's Expression 2 :P
[6:24] <Scrippy> For things.
[6:24] <revenant> I HAVE TYPED LS THREE GODDAMN TIMES IN THE CMD PROMPT
[6:24] <Visiiri> Don't know C++
[6:24] <Visiiri> Well, not much
[6:24] <revenant> Is there any way to have it convert any instance of 'ls' to 'DIR' > >?
[6:24] <vede> (I mean, I'm still pretty new to C++, so I'd like to know.)
[6:24] <revenant> vede
[6:24] <Yourself> for ints it won't make much of a difference, but for iterators it can be a significant impact
[6:24] <vurtual> my above if concept would take the first argument, check it, and then if it returns true, do the second argument.
[6:24] <revenant> C > Obj-C > C++
[6:24] <revenant> It's the truth.
[6:24] <TkTech> vede: There is an actual reason to use prefix increments instead of post-increments in a for() loop
[6:24] <Yourself> i++ creates a copy of the object in i
[6:24] <Scrippy> I guess I'll just play more dorffort in the meantime.
[6:24] <TkTech> vede: Although most people don't know what it actually does
[6:25] <vurtual> ifelse could take another argmuent for an else.
[6:25] <revenant> Yourself, it's not quite so simple
[6:25] <TkTech> Ahh Yourself does appear to know a bit at least
[6:25] <revenant> the postfix operators are weeiiiird
[6:25] <vurtual> now I'm thinking in code
[6:25] <revenant> they do things oddlty.
[6:25] <Yourself> since it has to increment and then return an old value
[6:25] <vurtual> and all my sentences are being parsed like code.
[6:25] * Golden (ghmorris15@ip72-193-89-211.lv.lv.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
[6:25] <Yourself> pre increment doesn't
[6:25] <vede> Okay, so why pre-increment instead of post-increment in a for loop?
[6:25] <TkTech> I think its going to be more entertaining to watch you guys discuss this instead of giving you the answers. lawl.
[6:26] <Yourself> it's good practice to always use pre-increment when you don't use the returned value
[6:26] <revenant> TkTech, i'm with you.
[6:26] <vurtual> and {ALL PERSON my OBJECT sentences ARE ACTION parsed SIMILE "code"}
[6:26] <vurtual> my thought process right now.
[6:26] <revenant> SELECT response FROM table?
[6:26] <revenant> are we talking in sequel now?
[6:26] <revenant> :\
[6:27] <revenant> fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", "I prefer this, it's nice and safe, though not asynch_sig safe...");
[6:27] <Yourself> one of C++'s biggest problems is its habit of making copies all over the place
[6:27] <Yourself> it can be avoided, though
[6:27] <revenant> well, it generally uses references.
[6:27] <revenant> Which are...
[6:27] <TkTech> revenant: You'd be fired if you worked for microsoft.
[6:27] <revenant> NOT COPIES >:O
[6:27] <revenant> TkTech, why?
[6:28] <TkTech> %s
[6:28] <revenant> > >?
[6:28] <Yourself> and the new standard will incorporate better copy semantics
[6:28] <revenant> %s is nice, what
[6:28] <vurtual> okay I'm in the wrong sense of thought
[6:28] <vurtual> I have to be in hammer entity mode
[6:28] <vurtual> I have TWO BUTTONS

[6:28] <TkTech> revenant: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb288454.aspx
[6:28] <vurtual> I need to have them independently toggle something, and when it's toggled on, it must do something, and off, it does something else

[6:29] <Visiiri> I've decided i am going to dump AutoHotKey
[6:29] <Visiiri> even though it's easy as fuck
[6:29] <TkTech> of course.
[6:29] <vurtual> So button1/button2 send TOGGLE to this entity, which then is either off or on, and if it's one, it becomes the either and does the off/on related output
[6:29] <TkTech> All functions that don't take a max-length are banned.
[6:29] <TkTech> because they're the #1 cause of buffer overflow attacks
[6:29] <revenant> Well, that's somewhat reasonable :\
[6:29] <TkTech> and the #1 cause of most windows exploits
[6:30] <Yourself> that's why you'll find strcpy_s
[6:30] <revenant> fnprintf(stdout, "%s\n", "I can do this too you know", 27);
[6:30] <revenant> I should have used len() :\
[6:30] <revenant> OH LET ME GUESS THEY BANNED LEN() TOO >:(
[6:30] <TkTech> ...you mean strlen?
[6:30] <TkTech> Of course.
[6:30] <revenant> D:
[6:30] <Yourself> actually, you shouldn't be formatting a static string into it in the first place
[6:31] <revenant> > > silence fool
[6:31] <Visiiri> What is this 'str' thing?
[6:31] <revenant> string literals are stack allocated anyhow.
[6:31] <revenant> it'd be the same if I stuck it in a variable.
[6:31] <Yourself> it'd be better if you just put it straight into the format string

[6:35] <vurtual> whenever I try mapping for half-life, I immediately get stuck on some arbitrary thing
[6:35] <vurtual> which doesn't work out right
[6:35] <Visiiri> fasil
[6:35] <vurtual> so I have to spend hours trying to make it work
[6:35] <vurtual> and by the time I DO GET ANYTHING REMOTELY CLOSE TO WORKING
[6:35] <vurtual> The entire map just seems... unfinishable, I can't go back to it, no matter how hard I try, and have to scrap everything associated with it.
[6:35] <vurtual> and then all my design time was wasted.
[6:35] <Calhoun> Not wasted
[6:36] <Calhoun> it was still a learning experience, no?
[6:36] <vurtual> not really
[6:36] <vurtual> spending a long time trying to shape out my game area?
[6:36] <vurtual> I mean thsis whole area design, these things often take weeks before one just hits me.

[6:51] <revenant> It's working out of the box (a very tricky box)
[6:51] <liq3> o.O
[6:51] <Konogan> What do you mean by unstable?
[6:51] <Bomb_Spammer> You know what I miss?
[6:51] <revenant> unstable as in prone to performance and usability issues, or crashing.
[6:51] <Calhoun> I've yet to have a blue screen on Win 7, and i've been using it since the Open Beta.
[6:51] <liq3> Konogan: Not locking up or slowing down after long use.
[6:51] <revenant> I've seen plenty of Blue Screens
[6:51] <revenant> One really fun one.
[6:51] <Calhoun> Though, compatibility in the earlier builds was an issue.
[6:51] <Bomb_Spammer> Updates
[6:52] <revenant> I was sitting at school in class
[6:52] <ZarroTsu> <liq3> It's only ever blue screened once. <- So has my experience with Vista, and I've had Vista longer than Windows 7 existed, soooooo
[6:52] <liq3> When I had windows 98 i'd often end up restarting the comp 3-4 times a day it was so unstable.
[6:52] <revenant> working in the comp lab.
[6:52] <Konogan> Every OS I used never slowed down after prolongued use.
[6:52] <revenant> And Word freezes up.
[6:52] <revenant> and I'm just like
[6:52] <revenant> DAMMIT
[6:52] <revenant> and I kick the box
[6:52] <revenant> BLUE SCREEN
[6:52] <liq3> ZarroTsu: IT only bluescreen'd because I was being naughty with it. :p
[6:52] <revenant> then I was like GOD FUCKING DAMN IT
[6:52] <revenant> and the teacher looked at me all cross...
[6:52] <ZarroTsu> And then you realize you're running Office Word when notepad is better
[6:52] <revenant> Precisely.
[6:52] <Konogan> Weird, I never had stability issue with 98 :P
[6:52] <revenant> And then I realise I could be using emacs!
[6:52] <revenant> Konogan
[6:53] <revenant> same for me, but with 2000
[6:53] <revenant> Never had any issues with good ol
[6:53] <ZarroTsu> you could be using zshell
[6:53] <revenant> 2000...
[6:53] * revenant memories...
[6:53] <liq3> vim... isn't that the one people love?
[6:53] <Calhoun> I remember Windows ME. Whoo that was FUN
[6:53] <liq3> that's ludicriously confusing. :(
[6:54] <ZarroTsu> Windows Media Edition: the beta version of current apple products
[6:54] <Konogan> I think your choice of OS depend on what you do with it.
[6:54] <Calhoun> Mostly
[6:55] <Konogan> Anyway, I can do anything the other OS do on windows, so why switch?
[6:55] <ZarroTsu> Honestly I'd be on my ubuntu partition if it had a broader variety of compatibility with games :(
[6:55] <liq3> i only use windows cause of games.
[6:55] <ZarroTsu> now it's just taking up HDD space
[6:55] <liq3> If Linux had games i'd be using that.
[6:55] <Konogan> Yup
[6:55] <ZarroTsu> Linux does have games (and Wine), but not a broad use
[6:55] <Konogan> What does Mac have?
[6:55] <ZarroTsu> Linux' games are horrid, trust me
[6:55] <Calhoun> Well, one day, WINE will be perfect! and then we will achieve the end times
[6:55] <ZarroTsu> or well
[6:55] <liq3> ZarroTsu: that's the problem. I have like 50+ games on steam, most of which won't work on windows.
[6:55] <ZarroTsu> the Ubuntu downloader's games are horrid
[6:55] * Dysgalt is now known as Dys|games
[6:55] <liq3> erm, Linux*
[6:56] <revenant> Konogan
[6:56] <revenant> as for Mac games.
[6:56] <revenant> tomorrow we get Steam :\
[6:56] <ZarroTsu> there's a freeware RPG for ubuntu that's clearly made in game maker, that litterally locks up if you get stuck in a wall
[6:56] <revenant> we'll see how that goes.
[6:56] <Konogan> revenant, not all the games :P
[6:56] <revenant> No, of course not but
[6:56] <Konogan> just steam.
[6:56] <revenant> it's an easy incentive
[6:56] <ZarroTsu> and it's the ONLY rpg on ubuntu
[6:56] <ZarroTsu> that's... really sad
[6:56] <Calhoun> No

[6:56] * Golden (ghmorris15@ip72-193-89-211.lv.lv.cox.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[6:56] <revenant> Actually, just the source ones for now.
[6:57] <revenant> devs have to put up Mac versions
[6:57] <revenant> but it gives an incentive for devs to write mac versions
[6:57] <revenant> (they can monetize a teeny bit of effort)
[6:57] <revenant> Assuming they wrote the original in OpenGL
[6:57] <revenant> if they did, then it's quite easy to port
[6:57] <Calhoun> If not, It's probably not worth it.
[6:57] <liq3> the problem is that people are using directX
[6:57] <ZarroTsu> I'd like if developers translated their games to all Gui mediums
[6:57] <liq3> anyone who uses OpenGL + SDL can easily port their app to Linux/Mac.
[6:58] <Konogan> That's a shame because most of the good games are DX
[6:58] <ZarroTsu> it's just the matter of how different the programming is between what's compatible :/
[6:58] <liq3> Konogan: eh?
[6:58] <revenant> liq3, even just OpenGL
[6:58] <Konogan> DirectX
[6:58] <liq3> revenant: wel lyeh.
[6:58] <revenant> if you define your drawing routines extenrally
[6:58] <liq3> I dunno how easy stuff like BSD sockets is to port.
[6:58] <revenant> changing your windowing system isn't too hard.
[6:58] <revenant> BSD Sockets is relatively not too bad.
[6:58] <liq3> or input/sound systems.
[6:58] <revenant> Winsock uses a lot of similar names
[6:58] <liq3> >.<
[6:58] <revenant> and the way it works is similar.
[6:58] <liq3> I mean.
[6:59] <revenant> so you can just do a shitton of #IFDEF _WIN32...
[6:59] <liq3> You could even just design your network to be extremely dynamic.
[6:59] <liq3> Have all your send/recvs external in single functions.
[6:59] <revenant> precisely.
[6:59] <liq3> so it's just 1-2 functions + connections you gotta edit.
[6:59] <liq3> Instead we get noobs like Xbox 360 ports that fail.
[6:59] <revenant> and then you have the code use precompiler directives to adapt to the OS
[6:59] <revenant> and now guys...
[6:59] <revenant> it's time for the crowning moment of all new OS tests.
[6:59] <liq3> The worst is people that use XNA. I will never understand that.

[7:00] <Konogan> But macc have bad driver support for gaming hardware.
[7:00] <Calhoun> THough, did you get a Codec pack yet?
[7:00] <revenant> Konogan
[7:00] <revenant> not really :|
[7:00] <Calhoun> Hmm
[7:00] <Konogan> yes :P
[7:00] <revenant> the OpenGL 3.1 drivers are top notch.
[7:00] <Konogan> I think
[7:00] <Konogan> Wow
[7:00] <revenant> they jsut don't have directX
[7:00] <Konogan> I said drivers for hardware
[7:00] <revenant> so they claim they're "bad"
[7:00] <vurtual> directX is pretty important
[7:00] <Konogan> I'm not talking about opengl or DirectX
[7:00] <vurtual> but hey wait
[7:00] <revenant> OpenGL 3.1 based hardware accelerating drivers*
[7:01] <vurtual> has anyone tried the mac versions of steam on linux?
[7:01] <liq3> DirectX is terrible.
[7:01] <revenant> the drivers for the graphics cards themselves are good.
[7:01] <revenant> vurtual
[7:01] <revenant> hold out on that
[7:01] * Darkflux (Darkflux@lister.csse.unimelb.edu.au) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[7:01] <revenant> DirectX 11 is actually a bit nicer.
[7:01] <revenant> but...
[7:01] <revenant> OpenGL 3.1
[7:01] <revenant> is quite beautiful.
[7:01] <liq3> OpenGL is just as good as Direct3d, but portable.
[7:01] <revenant> I must say.
[7:01] <revenant> Well, it wasnt always liq3
[7:01] <revenant> for a long time, up unti 2007/8 ish, it wasnt quite
[7:01] <liq3> The thing is... I just played Thief 2 yesterday, only first mission. It's better then 90% of the AAA games these days.
[7:01] <EmpiresBane> i finally got my new ohone activated
[7:01] <revenant> since it was dragging a lot of old compatibility extensions
[7:02] <liq3> And it's gfx are ancient by todays standards.
[7:02] <revenant> now we're finally deprecating all that crap.
[7:02] <liq3> So the whole "directX vs opengl" thing is moot anyway, since gameplay is more important. :P
[7:02] <revenant> of course
[7:02] <vurtual> Triple A?
[7:02] <vurtual> Everyone knows double A are bigger.
[7:02] <revenant> but it's a medium for that
[7:02] <vurtual> what about the one-A batteries!?
[7:02] <revenant> Most people don't like A's
[7:02] <Calhoun> liq3: What, MADNESS? GRAPHICAL QUALITY IS ALL THAT MATTERS /sarcasm

[7:19] <vurtual> Calhoun, you know how linux users are.
[7:19] <revenant> I downloaded the beta and checked...and the plist settings are in fact there.
[7:19] <Calhoun> I guess it's closer to possible now.
[7:19] <vurtual> They'll buy things just to make a point.
[7:19] <revenant> There are hints at a Linux steam in the files.
[7:19] <vurtual> JUST to make a point
[7:19] <revenant> evidence
[7:19] <vurtual> Now imagine if STEAM were on linux.
[7:19] <revenant> vurtual
[7:20] <revenant> look at the average contribution
[7:20] <revenant> http://www.wolfire.com/humble
[7:20] <revenant> scroll down
[7:20] <revenant> Windows: 7.99
[7:20] <vurtual> yeah yeah linux pays more
[7:20] <revenant> Mac: 10.20
[7:20] <revenant> Linux....
[7:20] <vurtual> Firstly there's like a bunch of games, they'll try to buy a lot.
[7:20] <revenant> 14.56
[7:20] <vurtual> linux users are loaded.
[7:20] <revenant> it's pay as much as you want.
[7:20] <vurtual> ironically.
[7:20] <Calhoun> I actually already had 3/5 of them
[7:21] <Calhoun> so i only chose to pay 7.50
[7:21] <revenant> I payed 20.00...

[7:21] * broknecho (1@199.126.13.185) has joined #minecraft

[7:22] <revenant> it is amusing tho
[7:22] <revenant> win users are cheap
[7:22] <revenant> linux users pay a lot.
[7:22] <Calhoun> Well, They made a million.
[7:22] <revenant> yeah, despite the MASSIVE amount of give aways
[7:22] <Calhoun> I'd call it a success
[7:22] <vurtual> We have to buy everything, guys.
[7:23] <revenant> For instance, I literally posted my humble indie game key on facebook
[7:23] <vurtual> and I just had an idea!
[7:23] <revenant> And about 12 people I know downloaded it

[7:24] <Calhoun> Wait
[7:24] <Calhoun> what?
[7:25] <vurtual> So you could say, have a linux folder that functioned like a linux install, running with windows, so if you want to run something linux-specific, you could just rightclick and go "run under DISTRO(ubuntu?)"
[7:25] <vurtual> Like Wine I guess, but a bit more welded in there.
[7:25] <Calhoun> I'm sure it exists.

[7:31] <Wervyn> I can't believe the immediate answer was not "have sex".
[7:31] <vurtual> it's funner with a real person
[7:31] <vurtual> because it is
[7:31] <Wervyn> You could take a real person with you.
[7:31] <Calhoun> How would you know?
[7:31] <PuyoDead> http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/c2ps1/what_the_fuck_zelda/
[7:31] <vurtual> A holodeck-in-a-holodeck type situation, where the holodeck entrance leads into a ship-style area, whcih contains a massive area of legos.
[7:31] <Calhoun> Have you tried the Holodeck?
[7:31] <revenant> ok vurtual
[7:31] <revenant> let me explain something
[7:31] <revenant> the correct response to
[7:32] <revenant> "What would you do with <new form of tech>?"
[7:32] <revenant> is, was, and always will be...
[7:32] <revenant> porn.
[7:32] * KEROLiUKAS (kp@c-24-7-220-190.hsd1.il.comcast.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[7:32] <vurtual> that's because you're all dirty
[7:32] <vurtual> But really you could like, enter the holodeck ,and you have a lego building room
[7:32] <vurtual> and then a glowing, laser-targeted entry block.
[7:33] <revenant> and then a naked woman appears.
[7:33] <vurtual> which, wherever snapped, is where the door in the room(not the entrance-to-holodeck) leads to, acting like you're carrying the room.
[7:33] <vurtual> Then you can build things with legos, make working objects, and so on.
[7:33] <vurtual> and then walk out, and it's like you walked out of that block
[7:33] <vurtual> you can look around, and your lego-world is real!
[7:33] <vurtual> build a lego house, then walk into it.
[7:34] <Calhoun> If i have a holo-deck i'm not playing with legos
[7:34] <vurtual> LEGOS THAT YOU CAN LIVE IN?
[7:34] <vurtual> LEGOS THAT CAN BECOME A REAL CITY!?
[7:34] <vurtual> Carry around a little handheld device that projects a "hologram" baseplate, showing your area, and you can zoom in/out, and place legos there too.
[7:34] <vurtual> and basically freely manipulate a world... of legos.
[7:34] <Calhoun> Yes but
[7:34] <Calhoun> Legos are so RESTRICTIVE
[7:34] <vurtual> Shiny, plasticy, smooth legos
[7:34] <vurtual> and objects, too
[7:34] <vurtual> holodeck can always seamlessly merge things
[7:35] <Calhoun> I mean, We're dealing with a Holodeck here, why can't we use normal materials?
[7:35] <vurtual> because the legos are fun
[7:35] <Calhoun> Only when you work with them on a manual level
[7:35] <vurtual> you do
[7:35] <vurtual> and then walk around in them
[7:35] <vurtual> you can place a block, and watch it float down.
[7:35] <Wervyn> Man legos are awesome stfu.
[7:36] <vurtual> you could start up a SECOND HOLODECK, which has a holodeck-style entrance in the lego-world, and hten it's a holodeck
[7:36] <vurtual> You could make another whole ship inside it.
[7:36] <Calhoun> To what end?

[7:37] <Calhoun> Infinite recursion! How would you know what was real and what was fake?
[7:37] <vurtual> as much as you can compute.
[7:37] <vurtual> generally holodeck things can be told to stop exist.
[7:37] <Calhoun> Yeah
[7:37] <Calhoun> but in true Sci-fi Fashion
[7:37] <Calhoun> Something has to break
[7:37] <vurtual> old star trek sci-fi doesn't
[7:38] <vurtual> also in b4 some guy(probably me) basically tells holopeople that they are inside a simulation, about our future technology
[7:38] <vurtual> shows them their holofamily fade out
[7:38] <vurtual> leave them to rot
[7:38] <vurtual> and then end them

[7:38] <FireRat> Hi
[7:38] <Calhoun> HI!
[7:39] <vurtual> is red+green yellow on RGB?
[7:39] <FireRat> I have a question about trees.... What is the limit for them to grow when u plant them?
[7:40] <Calhoun> Whoa
[7:40] <PuyoDead> Holy shit. http://www.wolfire.com/humble?reddit=yay
[7:40] <revenant> yes vurtual
[7:40] <Calhoun> What's with all the questions?
[7:40] <FireRat> like a radius they need around them clear stuff like that?
[7:40] <PuyoDead> (catching up on today)
[7:40] <vurtual> k

[7:47] <vurtual> You know what'd be a cool feature?
[7:47] <Naserve> Damn you legacy!
[7:47] <vurtual> if it had a globe, centered on your location

[7:50] <Keiya> Now I have to play it, damnit >_>
[7:50] <vurtual> yep
[7:50] <Keiya> That game sucks but I've gotten too large a dose of achievementwhoritis
[7:50] <vurtual> CSS is fun dude
[7:50] <vurtual> They're all injokes too
[7:51] <vurtual> "rickrolled" for winning in under 30 seconds.
[7:51] <vurtual> killing spree, someone set up us the bomb(win via a bombplant), and such
[7:51] <vurtual> anyways brb I AM NOW PLAYING IT
[7:53] <vurtual> resolution options include 720x480
[7:53] <vurtual> and 1680x1050(native)
[7:53] <Keiya> vurtual: It's annoying
[7:53] <Calhoun> 720X480? Oh yeah
[7:53] <Calhoun> Is there any other way to roll?
[7:53] <Keiya> It's excessively hardcore, and there's no sort of introduction
[7:53] <vurtual> no introduction yeah
[7:53] <vurtual> but it's not HARD
[7:53] <Keiya> Maybe if I'd been playing since the start
[7:54] <Keiya> But now it's "lol you're dead" two seconds in
[7:54] <vurtual> not really
[7:54] <Keiya> Kinda hard to learn the game that way >_>
[7:54] <vurtual> you can jump in if you play with easy bots
[7:54] <vurtual> then you figure out guns you like
[7:54] <Drakkar> urgh
[7:54] <Drakkar> i need me sum CS:S beta
[7:54] <vurtual> I'm in it, Drakkar.
[7:54] <vurtual> :D
[7:54] <vurtual> Join meee
[7:54] <Drakkar> i noticed
[7:54] <Drakkar> HOW WOULD I JOIN YOU
[7:55] <Drakkar> "Notice: Thanks for your interest. We've filled the available slots."
[7:55] <Calhoun> Huh
[7:55] <Calhoun> Wow
[7:55] * Bored (Bored@CPE002129684fe2-CM0017ee5515e0.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #minecraft
[7:55] <Calhoun> They must have had more demand then they thought
[7:56] <Drakkar> idiots need to make betas like these automatically opt-in for people who actually own the games
[7:56] <Drakkar> god damn
[7:57] <vurtual> Drakkar
[7:57] <vurtual> it's a seperate game entry
[7:57] <vurtual> you have to manually download it
[7:57] <vurtual> it's also big.
[7:57] <Keiya> Drakkar: Er?
[7:57] <Keiya> I can't even figure out how to join
[7:57] <Keiya> The only beta listed for me is the UI update
[7:57] <Drakkar> i'm aware
[7:58] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[7:58] <Drakkar> Keiya, you have to apply manually in their store entry
[7:58] <vede> Fud. I think I'm gonna have to try out Penumbra again.
[7:58] <Drakkar> and there's no slots left
[7:58] <vurtual> starting... beta server.
[7:58] <vurtual> about to play
[7:58] <Drakkar> lemme know how it is
[7:58] <Keiya> How... why...
[7:58] <Drakkar> exactly
[7:58] <Drakkar> if you own CS:S
[7:58] <Drakkar> you likely would apply for the beta
[7:58] <vede> First two times I played it I quit because I died. (That sounds dumb, but dying in horror games seriously just kills the hell out of the experience for me.)
[7:58] <Drakkar> right?
[7:58] <vurtual> new, more solid scoreboard
[7:58] <Drakkar> so why the fuck wouldn';t they make it automatic
[7:58] <Keiya> Why the hell do they have a 'beta program' selection thing if they're NOT GONNA USE IT
[7:59] <Drakkar> yeah that too
[7:59] <vurtual> mvp goes to aidan
[7:59] <Drakkar> they only use it for client betas
[7:59] <vurtual> radio voice nwo has avatar
[7:59] <vurtual> THIS IS AWESOME
[7:59] <Naserve> Your going to die a few times Vede, be it trial and error or just fucking something up
[7:59] <vurtual> ORIN KILLED YOU
[7:59] <Naserve> Turn the difficulty down to make those stupid dogs less of a factor. In Black Plague they got rid of combat because it was terrible
[8:00] <FireRat> Flat Map is goofy...
[8:01] <vurtual> you're a bit faster now.
[8:01] <vurtual> well, accelerate faster
[8:01] <vurtual> recoil is supposedly different, there's the MVP thing
[8:01] <vurtual> the solidyness looks out of place thoguh
[8:01] <Keiya> Drakkar: I've opted into CS:S betas through that before
[8:02] <Drakkar> really?
[8:02] <Keiya> Every time they update it I tend to try it a little and then give up 'cause there's no sense of reward for dying instantly
[8:02] <Drakkar> fucking lazy bastards
[8:02] <Calhoun> Keiya: Perhaps they removed it from the beta system because they filled all the slots?

[8:02] <Drakkar> no
[8:02] <Drakkar> the combat is still there
[8:03] <Drakkar> you just have no chance of winning
[8:03] <Drakkar> you don't have a weapon
[8:03] * arxx (Mibbit@tabasalu-gw.radionet.ee) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[8:03] <Drakkar> technically you shouldn't be fighting in the first either though
[8:03] <Drakkar> running tends to be a much better solution in all cases
[8:04] <Drakkar> or hiding
[8:04] <vurtual> joining public server.
[8:04] <Keiya> I gave up Penumbra
[8:04] <Drakkar> don't get me wrong though
[8:04] <Drakkar> i love the game
[8:05] <Keiya> Because I couldn't get the hatch thing open
[8:05] <Malikat> drakkar
[8:05] <Drakkar> i've beaten the series a couple of times
[8:05] <Malikat> it's you
[8:05] <Drakkar> wut
[8:05] <Keiya> Also
[8:05] <Drakkar> Keiya,
[8:05] <Drakkar> you have to pull on the edge of the hatch
[8:05] <Drakkar> after turning the wheel
[8:05] * Malikat peers intently at drakkar
[8:05] <Keiya> the menus are REALLY unusable if you turn the sensitivity up to the point that you can turn without lifting the mouse a few hundred times
[8:05] <Malikat> you're like the bartender from goats
[8:05] <Drakkar> o_O
[8:06] <Drakkar> that may be your own problem
[8:06] <Drakkar> i have sensitivity at max
[8:06] <Naserve> Drakkar I define getting rid of combat as not having a weapon to fight with. In Black Plague they turned down the quantity of enemies and placed them so that you have an easier time of sneaking past them or waiting them out. Regardless its an improvement on Overture
[8:07] <Drakkar> well yeah
[8:07] <Drakkar> thats absolutely true
[8:07] <Drakkar> mechanically its improved
[8:07] <Drakkar> though i think its less scary
[8:07] <Naserve> I suppose. Those spiders scared the piss out of me in Overture
[8:07] <Drakkar> yeah
[8:07] <Drakkar> fuck the spiders
[8:08] <Drakkar> i blame the sound effects though
[8:08] <Drakkar> hearing the scrabbling of spiders in areas you can't see shit messed with me pretty bad

[8:10] <Naserve> Yeah. I think they gave us a bit too much light though. At the end of the game I had 75% battery power, the glowstick, and 14 flares
[8:10] <Drakkar> the glowstick is all you need
[8:10] <Drakkar> really
[8:10] <Drakkar> unless you deal with spiders
[8:10] <Drakkar> i think they ignored the glowstick
[8:10] * TO-AFK (theone@ks-76-7-196-124.dhcp.embarqhsd.net) has joined #minecraft
[8:11] <Drakkar> but the glowstick was a really good light
[8:11] <Naserve> Yeah. I used the flashlight a decent bit though, to check maps and far away things
[8:11] <Marach-17> i can't wait for gish mods :D
[8:11] <Drakkar> yeah it was good for distance stuff
[8:12] <Drakkar> i can't wait for their next game
[8:12] <Drakkar> :D
[8:12] <Naserve> They're working on a new one?
[8:12] * Keiya shrugs
[8:12] <Drakkar> yeah
[8:12] <Drakkar> not part of penumbra though
[8:12] <Keiya> Aquaria is my favorite of the pack by far, either way
[8:12] <Drakkar> yeah its all good
[8:12] <Drakkar> different strokes and stuff
[8:12] <Marach-17> i didn't believe it will reach $1,000,000.
[8:13] <Calhoun> Of course it would
[8:13] <Drakkar> Naserve: since you liked the penumbra games, you should get pathologic when they retranslate it
[8:13] <Calhoun> It got wild publicity
[8:13] <EmpiresBane> Marach-17, you got some tense confliction there...
[8:13] <EmpiresBane> did it reach that?
[8:13] <Calhoun> Ohyeah
[8:13] <Drakkar> yes
[8:13] <Calhoun> it's almost 1.1 mil
[8:13] <EmpiresBane> holy shit
[8:13] <Marach-17> ?
[8:13] <Marach-17> why would i lie
[8:14] <EmpiresBane> Marach-17, you could have meant to say, "i don't believe it will reach $1,000,000."
[8:14] <Marach-17> but WoG won't go opensource >:(
[8:14] <Drakkar> its not a big deal
[8:15] <Drakkar> their technology isn't that impressive
[8:15] <Naserve> I take it the new game you were talking about is Amnesia Dark Deccent
[8:15] <Drakkar> i think gish's was probably the most interesting
[8:15] <Drakkar> yeah
[8:15] <Drakkar> because gish's was actually y'know
[8:15] <Drakkar> technically excellent

[8:15] <Marach-17> amazing what you can achieve without even a bit of drm.
[8:15] <Keiya> Heh.
[8:15] <Drakkar> yep
[8:16] <Keiya> Of course
[8:16] <Marach-17> big companies should learn from that.
[8:16] <Keiya> Wasn't the piracy rate for Goo something like 90%?
[8:16] <Drakkar> yeah that was bullshit by them

[8:16] <TrueWolves> EVERYONE DIED
[8:16] <Drakkar> yeah
[8:16] <TrueWolves> before year 200
[8:17] <Keiya> DF has a piracy rate of 100%
[8:17] <Calhoun> TrueWolves: What was teh START year?
[8:17] <Drakkar> a lot of other pay what you want sales have proved that they make a lot more money that way
[8:17] <TrueWolves> 1050
[8:17] <Drakkar> Keiya, realy
[8:17] <Drakkar> because it makes like
[8:17] <Drakkar> 10k a month
[8:17] <Drakkar> on donations
[8:17] <Keiya> Drakkar: No one buys it though!
[8:17] <Drakkar> this is true
[8:17] <Drakkar> and may no one ever
[8:17] <Marach-17> piracy is illegal
[8:17] <Keiya> (Yay definition twisting)
[8:17] <Drakkar> i'll donate the fuck out of it though
[8:17] <Calhoun> Drakkar: I went to a show not that long ago, It was whatever the hell you wanted to pay to get in. Andrew Jackson Jihad was the main even, it was a pretty small venue. I dropped a 50.
[8:17] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[8:17] <Marach-17> dl'ing df isn't
[8:17] <Keiya> I actually haven't donated >_>
[8:18] <Drakkar> yeah Calhoun
[8:18] <Drakkar> paying what you want usually encourages bigger spenders to be all ;D
[8:18] <Calhoun> So the model works in lots of places.
[8:18] <Drakkar> a lot of people will actually sit down and pay what they think it deserves
[8:18] <Keiya> Yeah, a lot of people get it for all sorts of prices
[8:18] <Drakkar> even if they're rampant pirates
[8:18] <Keiya> It winds up averaging out to being /better/ than normal
[8:18] <EmpiresBane> it works of that feeling of being cheap
[8:19] <Drakkar> i know people who just repeatedly bought the humble bundle to donate to charity
[8:19] <Drakkar> out of laziness
[8:19] <Keiya> Of course, there's, um.
[8:19] <Keiya> The problem that if you payed EA what you thought, say, Spore was worth....
[8:19] <Keiya> they'd probably go brok
[8:19] <Drakkar> i paid EA what I thought spore was worth
[8:19] <Drakkar> I don't own spore
[8:20] <EmpiresBane> Spore was fun for the first 8 hours
[8:20] <Yourself> spore had potential
[8:20] <EmpiresBane> then the space stage got boring
[8:20] <Calhoun> I Bought the Collectors Edition way before it released, and the DRM scheme was detailed. It's good, It wasn't what I had always hoped for.
[8:20] <EmpiresBane> Yourself, spore looked great before it got delayed
[8:20] <Calhoun> They spread themselves too thin.
[8:20] <Yourself> yeah the "sandbox" not a sandbox
[8:21] <EmpiresBane> i've been thinking of pirating the expansion, then buyong it if it's actually any good
[8:21] <Yourself> "you can do what you want...provided you fight of pirates or the grox every 5 minutes"
[8:22] <Calhoun> Yourself: I found a mod that changed that. It made things so much more bearable.
[8:22] <Calhoun> Pirate attacks were so damn annoying
[8:22] <Yourself> yeah, you don't have to worry about them once you get uber turrets
[8:22] <Yourself> uber turrets were hilarious
[8:22] <Yourself> but they'd attack allied colonies
[8:23] <EmpiresBane> they would?
[8:23] <Yourself> that or eco disasters or the grox
[8:23] <Yourself> and the combat was awful
[8:23] <Yourself> allied ships were totally worthless
[8:23] <Calhoun> They were good cannon fodder
[8:24] <EmpiresBane> i was always shooting my allies on accident because they would fly under my cursor
[8:24] <TrueWolves> I found allies to be very useful if annoying for one reason
[8:24] <Yourself> A and D should be strafe
[8:24] <TrueWolves> You could never bring your own ships.
[8:24] <Yourself> anyone who makes them yaw should be shot
[8:25] <TrueWolves> Also, why did Space have to take up 60% of the game o.e
[8:25] <Yourself> i figured at the space stage i'd actually be able to...i don't know, build a fleet
[8:25] <Yourself> like every god damn AI player could
[8:25] <TrueWolves> I wouldn't mind your flag ship being half as powerful if fleet building options were in.
[8:26] <TrueWolves> The shield is a bit of a game breaker if you ever finaly get it anyway
[8:26] <Yourself> let my fleet deal with defending my empire
[8:27] <Calhoun> Whenever i feel like playing space stage of spore, I just play Gallactic Civillizations.
[8:28] <Yourself> the other stages were way too short
[8:28] <Yourself> especially civ stage
[8:28] <Yourself> i remember the first time i got to that
[8:28] <Yourself> 20 minutes later i was in space
[8:28] <Calhoun> It's not so much the length, it's the length because of the lack of features.
[8:28] <TrueWolves> "Economic buy everyone out lul"
[8:28] <Yourself> yeah, because there was nothing to do
[8:29] <TrueWolves> The worst affender was Tribe stage
[8:29] <TrueWolves> cell lasted some time, creature could last a lot if you tried to unlock everything
[8:29] <TrueWolves> THEN POW
[8:29] <TrueWolves> 5 minute stage
[8:29] <Calhoun> Eugh
[8:29] <Calhoun> Tribes stage
[8:29] <Calhoun> was just
[8:29] <Calhoun> ANNOYING
[8:30] <Calhoun> Wow
[8:30] <Calhoun> Someone DOnated $3333.33

[8:31] <Yourself> i almost donated $250 to get on the top 10
[8:31] <Marach-17> lol
[8:31] <Yourself> i wouldn't be on it now
[8:31] <Marach-17> i thought $1000 is the max limit
[8:31] <Calhoun> Why woudl they put in a limit?
[8:31] <Yourself> almost wanted to get on the top 10 and put #minecraft sucks as the name or something

[8:32] <Yourself> i donated ended up doing $100, though
[8:32] <Calhoun> TrueWolves: Thats pretty much what i meant by annoying. It was either a walk in the park, or an excersize in frustration.

[8:52] <Vicrry> Fallout 3 isn't a bad game, just isn't great. It falls to the same problem as a lot of Bethesda's stuffs: bugs and a few poor design choices take too much away from the game

[9:41] <Naserve> I never noticed them coming back to life in my game
[9:41] <vede> Also, the obscure puzzles that apparently only have one solution.
[9:41] <Naserve> I just noticed a ton of them
[9:42] <vede> In the very beginning, Naserve, before you detonate the TNT, the first wolf you encounter.
[9:42] <vede> He comes back to life if you go to the office then go back to the mine.
[9:42] <Naserve> Thats because hes part of a cutscene later on. I suppose its a flaw in design, he should of come out of a locked room for that scene
[9:42] <bildramer> penumbra is a kind of shadow amirite
[9:42] <bildramer> bbl
[9:43] <vede> Anyway, detonating the TNT is apparently impossible by any mortally comprehensible means.
[9:43] <Naserve> How so
[9:43] <vede> I've got the TNT in the hole, got the fuse in it, but lighting the fuse... I've held two flares, flamey end up, at the fuse, and even tossed a stick of dynamite into the hole.
[9:43] <vede> No luck.
[9:44] <Naserve> Zippo lighter

[9:45] <vede> Yeah, I have the lighter fluid.
[9:46] <vede> I've also held a lit lantern up to the fuse and beat the fuck out of it with a pickaxe.
[9:46] <LuciferZ> Guys, I'm thinking about streaming, but I need good suggestions for what to draw.
[9:47] <Naserve> Well you need to get the zippo from the storage room, fill it with the fluid, and then light the fuse with it
[9:47] <Naserve> It can also be used to light lanterns
[9:47] <Yourself> man, it's irritating when some asks for help and then rejects the answers you give and insists on stubbornly trying to solve the problem in a way that won't
[9:47] <Yourself> work
[9:47] <Yourself> even after you explain why it won't work
[9:47] <LuciferZ> That is just about the worst.
[9:47] <vede> Yourself, surely you're not talking about me?
[9:47] <Yourself> although, because of this, I'll get to use WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY
[9:47] <Yourself> no
[9:47] <vede> Okay.
[9:47] <Yourself> i'm talking programming
[9:48] <Yourself> someone's asking about spatial hashing functions
[9:48] <Yourself> and they're doing it all wrong
[9:48] <vede> Because, uh, lit flare should light the fuse fuh-sho.
[9:48] <LuciferZ> But despite the fact they are asking you for help, they ignore all advice.
[9:48] <LuciferZ> And essentially continue being wrong.
[9:48] <Naserve> True, but I guess they wanted to make sure you had the zippo
[9:49] <Shadaez> umg ne1 wana play halo 3
[9:49] <Shadaez> my gamr tag is cloudstrife14421337
[9:49] <vede> We get people around here who ask questions, and ignore all the answers so they can call everyone dicks for not answering them. Then when they get banned for trolling, they can go to the forums and whine about how they "joined the channel, asked a question, and was banned immediately"
[9:49] <Yourself> they're trying to plug in the coordinates of a 3D object and expect that the hash value they get will put all objects in some order such that if i pick any hash all the objects nearby the point that generated that hash will generate nearby hashes
[9:49] <Yourself> it's all very stupid
[9:50] <vede> Why would you do that anyway?
[9:50] <LuciferZ> Nobody plays Halo 3 anymore, Shadaez, we're all playing the Reach beta
[9:50] <LuciferZ> Duh
[9:50] <Shadaez> well I have the reach beta too
[9:51] <Yourself> spatial hashing is meant to speed up collision detection
[9:51] <LuciferZ> Then why are you asking to play Halo 3? WHy play Halo 3 when you could play Invasion?
[9:51] <Yourself> by reducing the computational complexity
[9:51] <Yourself> naive collision detection is O(n?)
[9:52] <Yourself> since you just have each object check for a collision against each other object
[9:52] <Yourself> spatial hashing is a way of grouping objects by location so that you can use the naive method on a smaller set of objects
[9:52] <Shadaez> LuciferZ what's invasion?
[9:53] <Yourself> the simplest thing to do is to just break up the world into block shaped chunks and then have each chunk keep track of the objects inside it
[9:53] <Shadaez> I havn't actually played it, I just have it
[9:53] <Yourself> for a particular object, you can quickly cull objects that definitely can't be colliding with it
[9:53] <Yourself> without actually checking against individual objects
[9:54] <LuciferZ> Invasion is like escalating Territories. Elites try to capture zones deeper and deeper into the Spartan base. Last territory drops a core, which you then pick up and return to your dropship

[9:55] <LuciferZ> Can't :{
[9:55] <LuciferZ> Live expired yesterday, lol.
[9:55] <Shadaez> I feel like such a noob playing Halo
[9:55] <Shadaez> I just hate the console fanboys who love it
[9:56] <Yourself> aiming with your thumbs is for chumps
[9:56] <LuciferZ> There's not really that many console fanboys of it.
[9:56] <LuciferZ> Everyone complains about them but I've never actually met one.
[9:56] <liq3> Consoles are bad.
[9:56] <AndrewPH> LuciferZ, they're everywhere
[9:56] <Naserve> Vede, don't let the TNT thing turn you off of Overture. Its worth playing through and it sets up Black Plague nicely.
[9:56] <LuciferZ> Then I am graced.
[9:56] <Shadaez> LuciferZ how old are you? lol
[9:57] <AndrewPH> they're the ones that think halo is the best with no actual proof
[9:57] <LuciferZ> I'm twenty.
[9:57] <vede> Naserve, yeah, I'm going to try to continue it.
[9:57] <AndrewPH> they just reply with 'because itz the beatststs!11'
[9:57] <Shadaez> same, how did you not notice them during HS?
[9:57] <vede> Not tonight, though.
[9:57] <liq3> I remember Halo...
[9:57] <liq3> Blood Gulch was such a terrible map.
[9:57] <LuciferZ> I just didn't. I don't really pay attention to strangers on xbox live.
[9:57] <AndrewPH> I liked it
[9:58] <liq3> It's way too open.
[9:58] <AndrewPH> I don't see any problems with blood gulch
[9:58] <liq3> Snipers were so OP.
[9:58] <AndrewPH> I liked the openness tbh
[9:58] <LuciferZ> The thing that is worse than halo fanboys
[9:58] <AndrewPH> made it difficult
[9:58] <Shadaez> Yeah, blood gulch and other open maps are the best
[9:58] <LuciferZ> Is the people who hate halo for no reason.
[9:58] <liq3> ...
[9:58] <AndrewPH> sniper? no problem fire a rocket at them
[9:58] <Shadaez> I'm gonna go play
[9:58] <AndrewPH> or get in a tank and rape them
[9:58] <liq3> The campaigns are good.
[9:58] <Shadaez> AYAEFK
[9:58] <liq3> So much better then HL.
[9:58] <liq3> :]
[9:58] <Shadaez> get out fgt
[9:58] <LuciferZ> I mean, you could potentially argue that Halo is the best game. It's farfetched but at least somewhat possible.
[9:58] <vede> I don't much mind fanboys for anything. I mean, I'm sure most people (at least ninety percent) have a fanboyish love for *something*.
[9:58] <Yourself> was never interested in halo
[9:59] <Yourself> it was always just another generic shooter
[9:59] <LuciferZ> Whereas, a game as successful as Halo could never be the worst game.
[9:59] <liq3> Generic?
[9:59] <AndrewPH> yeah halo is p. generic tbh
[9:59] <liq3> It's like the SC of SP FPS games.
[9:59] <Yourself> yeah, generic
[9:59] <Shadaez> liq3 maeks me cry
[9:59] <Shadaez> make sure to add Console in there, then maybe.
[9:59] <LuciferZ> Yeah, it's pretty generic, but most shooter games are.

[10:01] <liq3> I found HL generic.
[10:01] <vede> What I hate is people who try to claim that, for instance, Bungie invented FPS games.
[10:01] <liq3> and boring.

[10:01] <LuciferZ> I probably would agree with you, having played both series.

[10:01] <liq3> Boooooooring.
[10:01] <LuciferZ> But until you have, you can't really make any comment.
[10:01] <Yourself> i've played some of one of the halos, but online
[10:02] <liq3> I actually never really played Halo online.
[10:02] <Yourself> does halo let me kill people with other people?
[10:02] <Yourself> by throwing the other people
[10:02] <AndrewPH> liq3, let's put it this way. Halo is stereotypical aliens on a giant fucking ring. Half life is a bunch of humanoid aliens and worms and giant ants and shit and a robotic dog thing.
[10:02] <AndrewPH> on earth
[10:02] <AndrewPH> and xen
[10:02] <liq3> And? It was _FUN_.
[10:02] <LuciferZ> Half life is Doom without Hell
[10:02] <liq3> Half Life was not FUN.

[10:04] <liq3> I've played and finished HL2 (every EP).
[10:04] <Yourself> oh, also the bug bait
[10:04] <AndrewPH> I somehow doubt that
[10:04] <liq3> Halo and Halo 2 were 10x more fun.
[10:04] <Yourself> that was fucking awesome
[10:04] <LuciferZ> Multiplayer? I disagree.
[10:04] <Yourself> breaking into nova prospekt with that shit was a blast
[10:04] <vede> Holy lag fuck.
[10:04] <LuciferZ> Both had some balancing issues.
[10:04] <AndrewPH> liq3, does halo have bugbait, a gravity gun, and a huge modding community?

[10:04] <liq3> AndrewPH: No. It didn't need gimmicks to be fun, it's that well done.
[10:04] <AndrewPH> liq3, they aren't gimmicks
[10:05] <AndrewPH> they're gameplay elements
[10:05] <Naserve> no but it haz lazurs and splosions! its tutally awesome n stuffs!
[10:05] <AndrewPH> of which halo has very few of
[10:05] <AndrewPH> :)
[10:05] <AndrewPH> <-- debate winner
[10:05] <liq3> o.O
[10:05] <LuciferZ> Not really, Andrew.
[10:05] <AndrewPH> LuciferZ, it's not a gimmick
[10:05] * quaxar (crackalack@c-76-104-190-132.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[10:05] <AndrewPH> no matter how you try to put it, the gravity gun is certainly not a gimmick
[10:05] <LuciferZ> I know you love your "Amiable troll who can argue well and is loved by community" self image
[10:06] <AndrewPH> the modding community isn't a gimmick either
[10:06] <Konogan> 3 possibilities here: 1- Liq3 think he's cool because he's different and don't like Half-Life 2- Liq 3 is a Halo fanboy 3- He is trolling.
[10:06] <LuciferZ> But Halo is not lacking in gameplay elements.
[10:06] <Yourself> i just really like the atmosphere of the whole half life series
[10:06] <AndrewPH> LuciferZ, oh ho ho yes it is
[10:06] <liq3> Konogan: No I really did find HL2 boring. I love teasing HL2 fanboys about it. :]
[10:06] <AndrewPH> it's the same thing over and over
[10:06] <Shadaez> ok nerds quit ragin
[10:06] <Yourself> taking out attack choppers just makes you feel epic
[10:06] <Konogan> :>
[10:06] <AndrewPH> Seriously, you'd think liq3 at least would look up the definition of gimmick
[10:06] <LuciferZ> Sky diving onto Scarabs from Hornets makes me feel epic.
[10:06] <Yourself> then there's the cutscenes and the whole story-telling component
[10:06] <Konogan> Anyway, I liked both :P
[10:06] <AndrewPH> a huge modding community is quite the opposite
[10:06] <LuciferZ> Splattering VIPs inside of bases feels epic.
[10:07] <AndrewPH> a gravity gun is also quite the opposite
[10:07] * Speljohan_Laptop (had07josjo@192.165.96.21) has joined #minecraft
[10:07] <Yourself> i remember that was the first thing that impressed me about the game
[10:07] <Yourself> was the lip synching
[10:07] <Konogan> We call that features.
[10:07] <AndrewPH> bugbait could have been done without but it was really fun and useful
[10:07] <Konogan> and gameplay elements.
[10:07] <AndrewPH> of which halo is lacking
[10:07] <liq3> Because Halo's core gameplay is fun.
[10:07] <LuciferZ> What is a gameplay element of Half Life 2 Andrew? One.
[10:08] <Konogan> Well, Halo is more standard, but that doesn't make it less fun.
[10:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> it is ridiculously overrated though
[10:08] <AndrewPH> I didn't say it wasn't fun
[10:08] <liq3> Like I said, Halo is the SC of SP FPS games.
[10:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> i remember the hype-train back in 1997
[10:08] <AndrewPH> It's just the same thing
[10:08] <Konogan> SC?
[10:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> "IT IS GOING TO REVOLUTIONIZE FPS'S"
[10:08] <LuciferZ> Andrew, for every element you name for HL, I'll name one for halo. Go.
[10:08] <liq3> Starcraft.
[10:08] <AndrewPH> I actually play halo 1 online all the time
[10:08] <Yourself> liq3, SC set the standard for RTS games

[10:37] <Speljohan_Laptop> i played once
[10:38] <Speljohan_Laptop> but i dislike non-traditional rts's
[10:38] <Speljohan_Laptop> i want intrigue, big maps where expansion is possible, procedurally generated maps, and all that

[10:41] <Speljohan_Laptop> rofl, sum guy wrote "how to impress a woman" thingie on the internet with lots of clich? shit right
[10:42] <Speljohan_Laptop> and a female friend of mine said "i'd be more impressed if he came to my home naked with a sixpack of beer and a judas priest record"
[10:43] <liq3> Anyone played AIwar?
[10:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> yeah, i've tried it
[10:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> quite interesting
[10:44] <liq3> I played it for a while but found it too predictable. :/
[10:45] <vede> If you play your cards right, Luci might draw nude chicks for you at http://www.livestream.com/blockcast
[10:45] <vede> So getcher asses over there.

[10:49] <Speljohan_Laptop> only problem i had with AIwar was that there's no normal multiplayer
[10:49] <Speljohan_Laptop> i find co-op boring and predictable
[10:49] <liq3> Speljohan_: there was no normal multi because it'd make balancing much much harder. :/
[10:49] <Speljohan_Laptop> seeing your opponent whine and qq about his losses is half the fun in an rts!
[10:49] <liq3> No it's not...
[10:49] <Speljohan_Laptop> yes it is :D
[10:50] <liq3> No, it's really not.
[10:50] <Speljohan_Laptop> it most definately is, very gratifying stuff!
[10:50] <liq3> Uh no?
[10:50] <Speljohan_Laptop> note however, it must be friends
[10:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> biggest reason i dont play online
[10:51] <liq3> Your friends must such at RTS games.
[10:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> too many 12 year old kids
[10:51] <liq3> suck*
[10:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> actually i have quite good friends
[10:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> who still qq
[10:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> :D
[10:51] <liq3> That's my point.
[10:51] <liq3> Most good players don't qq.
[10:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's part of the show when we play rts's
[10:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> kinda like poker-face
[10:51] <liq3> You play SC2 beta?
[10:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> nah
[10:52] <Speljohan_Laptop> i didnt like sc1
[10:52] <Speljohan_Laptop> doubt i'll like sc2
[10:52] <liq3> I see.

[10:53] <liq3> :P
[10:53] <Speljohan_Laptop> awesome*
[10:53] * Kom is now known as Kom|Gone
[10:54] <liq3> It has no idea how to do counters and combat.
[10:54] <Speljohan_Laptop> uhh what
[10:54] <Speljohan_Laptop> you do realize when i said aoe, i meant the whole series
[10:54] <Speljohan_Laptop> with aoe2 being my favourite obviously
[10:54] <liq3> I'm basing my experienc on 2.
[10:54] <liq3> so.
[10:54] <liq3> 2 was TERRIBLE.
[10:54] <Speljohan_Laptop> aoe2 has great balance
[10:54] <liq3> oh my god.
[10:54] <kwerty> WOLOLOO
[10:54] <kwerty> WOLOLOO
[10:54] <liq3> Speljohan_: it might be balanced, it's still got terrible combat and counters.
[10:54] <Speljohan_Laptop> nah, it's great fun
[10:55] <liq3> It took FOREVER for units to die.
[10:55] <liq3> HOLY SHIT.
[10:55] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol, no
[10:55] <kwerty> it's funny how the conversation always turns into aoe2 at this time of the day
[10:55] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's quite fast
[10:55] <kwerty> every day
[10:55] <Speljohan_Laptop> :D kwerty
[10:55] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's my hotspot moment kwerty
[10:55] <Kom|Gone> actually, what's funny is that someone's always arguing about something at this time of day.
[10:55] <Speljohan_Laptop> pfft
[10:55] <kwerty> Someone is always arguing here
[10:56] <Speljohan_Laptop> i argue on irc pretty much 24/7
[10:56] <Speljohan_Laptop> if not in here, in some other channel
[10:56] <liq3> Speljohan_: I have no idea how you could like AoE over SC.
[10:56] <Speljohan_Laptop> what else is there to do to pass ur time when you are broke and have nothing to do
[10:57] <liq3> Speljohan_: play free games.
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> because it's less micro
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> i barely play games
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> they bore me quickly
[10:57] <Yourself> i did like AoE
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> i've grown out of it pretty much
[10:57] <TrueWolves> Same things I do being broke online?
[10:57] <Kom|Gone> I'm broke, but I don't talk on IRC all day.
[10:57] <TrueWolves> Free online games like Iji and Cave Story
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> i do, because i live 20km from nearest town Kom|Gone
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> not much to do in that situation
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> and it's still too cold to go out fishing

[10:57] <TrueWolves> Learn from Minnesota
[10:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> !
[10:58] <TrueWolves> It is never to cold to go fishing
[10:58] <Yourself> speaking of which, hopefully my new video card will be here tomorrow
[10:58] <TrueWolves> too*
[10:58] <Kom|Gone> Well, as long as you enjoy yourself doing what you do.
[10:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> my "rich" year, i was on irc once a month for 10 minutes aproximately
[10:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> the rest of the time i was drunk
[10:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> and/or on a festival
[10:58] <Yourself> Kom|Gone, I definitely don't enjoy what i do
[10:58] <Kom|Gone> I couldn't stand being on IRC all the time though, I only talk occasionally.
[10:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's and old habit Kom|Gone
[10:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> been on irc for 10 years, i definately won't stop now
[10:58] <Yourself> yeah, i broke the IRC habit for a couple years
[10:59] <Yourself> then i came back
[10:59] <liq3> Speljohan_: http://www.gokgs.com/
[10:59] <Yourself> and now it's awful
[10:59] <Kom|Gone> Usually I work on programming or music or art and stuff.
[10:59] <liq3> What you program?
[10:59] <Speljohan_Laptop> i do music/programming too
[10:59] <Speljohan_Laptop> but i'm always on irc when i do
[10:59] <Speljohan_Laptop> :P
[10:59] <Kom|Gone> And if I'm not, I go play FPSes on Steam
[10:59] <kwerty> I hang around in irc pretty much all the time too
[10:59] <Yourself> i'd like to do more programming
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> then do it
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> nothing's stopping you
[11:00] <kwerty> I'd like to learn some programming
[11:00] <kwerty> But I'm too lazy :D
[11:00] <Kom|Gone> liq3: Yes, though I'm not professional or anything.
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> :P
[11:00] <Kom|Gone> Going to college next year for it though.
[11:00] <Yourself> Speljohan_, i program as a job
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> i am professional!
[11:00] <Yourself> and i get burned out on it
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> i will do that next fall Yourself
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> but it won't be that bad
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> i'll be working as a consult
[11:00] <Yourself> which is why i never wanted to ever program as a profession
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> so it will be more fun
[11:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> lots of different projects
[11:00] <Kom|Gone> I can spend hours just lost in code
[11:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> and i will focus more on design an implementation
[11:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> than actual programming
[11:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> eg my favourite part
[11:01] <liq3> Yourself: why don't you program indie then?
[11:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> ^
[11:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> indie can be quite profitable
[11:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> you just need the ideas
[11:01] <Kom|Gone> If you've got the ideas
[11:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> (something i lack)
[11:01] <Kom|Gone> Indeed
[11:01] <Kom|Gone> I do too.
[11:01] <Yourself> <Yourself> which is why i never wanted to ever program as a profession
[11:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> i have the experience to pretty much write anything handed to me
[11:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> but i never get handed ideas
[11:02] <Kom|Gone> Well, experience for me.
[11:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> :P
[11:02] <liq3> Speljohan_: so you could write a 3d RTS multiplayer engine from scratch?
[11:02] <Yourself> if i spend more than a couple hours at a time doing anything i'll get bored of it and not want to do it again
[11:02] <liq3> I mean use OpenGL and stuff.
[11:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> that's not hard liq3
[11:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> opengl is easy stuff
[11:02] <liq3> I know, I'm just inexperienced and can't.
[11:02] <liq3> xD
[11:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> :P
[11:03] <Kom|Gone> I've been working around with opengl, been having trouble kind of.
[11:03] <Yourself> there's one project i always wanted to finish
[11:03] <Speljohan_Laptop> i still remember rolf (from wurm) wanting me to work on the wurm client back in 2006
[11:03] <Yourself> and that was a little compiler for math expressions
[11:03] <Speljohan_Laptop> but i never signed the nda
[11:03] <Speljohan_Laptop> and never contacted him again
[11:03] <Speljohan_Laptop> lolol
[11:03] <Yourself> essentially a JIT compiler for lambda functions
[11:03] <Speljohan_Laptop> busy summer etc
[11:03] <liq3> Wurm is terrible.
[11:03] <liq3> It's just a giant time sink. :(
[11:03] <Speljohan_Laptop> great concept, shit performance
[11:04] <Speljohan_Laptop> if it weren't for the shit client and server i'd play
[11:04] <Yourself> i liked the idea of wurm and i got drawn in for a while
[11:04] <liq3> Same.
[11:04] <Speljohan_Laptop> seriously, the client is a complete pile of turd
[11:04] <Kom|Gone> I've never heard of it
[11:04] <liq3> I got drawn in for a few weeks.
[11:04] * Kom|Gone is now known as Kom
[11:04] <Speljohan_Laptop> i don't know what notch was thinkin'
[11:04] <liq3> Then I realised "fuck, this is wasting so much time".
[11:04] <Yourself> then after a week of standing at the end of a tunnel clicking on the wall every 23 seconds i thought "wtf am i doing?"
[11:04] <Speljohan_Laptop> it was probably one of notch's first big opengl projects tbh
[11:04] <liq3> Speljohan_Laptop: He wrote MC in Java... :P
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> because it is clear he didn't master it
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> yes i know liq3
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> he wrote the wurm client in java too
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> difference is, the wurm client is shit
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> in every way
[11:05] <Yourself> i was also turned off with the way the entire game economy workd
[11:05] <Yourself> worked*
[11:05] <liq3> I realised a few days ago, that writing MC in java is terribly stupid from a technical standpoint.
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> it really isn't
[11:05] <Yourself> the whole "all money in the game is real money"
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> people just have misconceptions about java
[11:05] <liq3> The only real boon is it runs in a browser.
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> as usual they drag arguments from 1998
[11:05] <Speljohan_Laptop> "IT IS TOO SLOW"
[11:05] <Yourself> so all the beginner island traders were totally and completely worthless because they had no money
[11:06] <liq3> Speljohan_: Nah I know something tipped it off for me.
[11:06] <liq3> I can't remember what tho.
[11:06] <liq3> OH RIGHT.
[11:06] <Yourself> so if you wanted to trade, you had to trade for exact value
[11:06] <liq3> Dwarf Fortress!~
[11:06] <Speljohan_Laptop> wat
[11:06] <Yourself> and you always needed to trade because animal spawns were broken
[11:06] <Speljohan_Laptop> elaborate liq3
[11:06] <Yourself> and it was the only way you could get animal pelts
[11:06] <Speljohan_Laptop> yeah, rolf is a shit programmer Yourself
[11:06] <Speljohan_Laptop> his server is complete turd
[11:06] <liq3> Dwarf Fortress is doing CRAZY amounts of calculations and shit, 100x more complex then MC, yet runs.
[11:06] <Yourself> which were inevitably the only way to up the quality to a decent quality
[11:06] * Mosslander (Mosslander@c-71-231-163-229.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[11:06] <Speljohan_Laptop> it has to do with implementation liq3
[11:06] <Yourself> to a decent level*
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> and programmer habit
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> you see
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> take this example
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> total annihilation was released in 1997
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> 1996*
[11:07] <Yourself> DF also isn't written in java
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> it had 3d engine
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> and
[11:07] <liq3> Yourself: that's my point. :p
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> required 16mb ram
[11:07] * Mosslander (Mosslander@c-71-231-163-229.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> if someone wrote the same thing today, exactly the same features, it would easily use 512mb ram or more
[11:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> because programmers have become lazy
[11:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> optimizations aren't as important anymore
[11:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> because of the powerful machines
[11:08] <liq3> :/
[11:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> they had to improvise ALOT during the 90's to make it run
[11:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> nomsayin'
[11:08] <Yourself> it's not cost effective to spend that kind of time optimizing
[11:08] <kwerty> I'd like to see MC as a stand-alone instead of running in a browser :(
[11:08] * Parthon (cheeeese@godsta.arach.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[11:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> exactly Yourself
[11:09] <liq3> I'd like to see MC C++ clients/servers.
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> that's the problem
[11:09] <Kom> optimization is important if you ask me
[11:09] <Yourself> why is that a problem?
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's all about money thesedays
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> i agree optimizations are important
[11:09] <Yourself> it's always been about money
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> many do not
[11:09] <Yourself> it's just that in order to make money your game has to run
[11:09] <liq3> FUck cost effective. If you go by big companies standpoints, it's not cost effective to make a "good" game.
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> it was more about passion in the 90's Yourself
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> because less of the casual market existed
[11:09] <Kom> especially if you program like me
[11:09] <Yourself> in the past, this required a lot of tricks because of hardware limitations
[11:09] <Yourself> now it doesn't
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> and less market revenue
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> etc
[11:09] <liq3> Companies like Ubisoft realising hand holding pieces of shit like Conviction.
[11:09] <liq3> >.<
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> <liq3> FUck cost effective. If you go by big companies standpoints, it's not cost effective to make a "good" game.
[11:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> exactly.
[11:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> the market has declined oldschool players
[11:10] <AndrewPH> bad companies are overserved good companies
[11:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> just like the music industry has declined oldschool music people
[11:10] <AndrewPH> afk
[11:10] <liq3> Yeh.
[11:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> and the movie industry has stopped making good movies
[11:10] <liq3> Classical music is epic.
[11:10] <liq3> I dunno why people don't like it.
[11:10] <Yourself> there are still plenty of good games
[11:10] <kwerty> Games were made for playing in the 90s, not for profit. Atleast it felt like that way :(
[11:10] <Yourself> there's always been crap
[11:10] <liq3> Shit like screamo and stuff coming out.
[11:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> indeed kwerty
[11:10] <Speljohan_Laptop> and yeah liq3
[11:10] <Yourself> it's just easier to find now with the internet and publishers
[11:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> dildocore is my term for it liq3
[11:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> :D
[11:11] <liq3> lol.
[11:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> the decline of talent
[11:11] <Kom> it's not even music if you ask me.
[11:11] <Yourself> you've got things like the mass effect series
[11:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> and the increase of college kids thinking they are musicians
[11:11] <Yourself> and the half life series
[11:11] <liq3> Yourself: It's not so much that... Aside from indie games, Barley ANY companies are making good games these days.
[11:11] <Yourself> bioware
[11:11] <Yourself> valve
[11:11] <liq3> It's basically Valve and Blizzard, that's it.
[11:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> 2 companies in an ocean of shit
[11:11] <Speljohan_Laptop> nice.

[11:12] <liq3> I never finished Bioshock, couldn't take it.

[11:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> i liked dragon age, that's about it
[11:13] <liq3> Speljohan_: Can't blame Blizzard for WoW. 99.99% of people who were in their poosition would milk it too.
[11:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> yeah well, i was disappointed on release already liq3
[11:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> because it was way too casual
[11:13] <liq3> It's the consumer's fault honestly.
[11:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> true
[11:13] <Speljohan_Laptop> casuals shouldn't be allowed to play games
[11:13] <liq3> :p
[11:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> just like they shouldn't be allowed to listen to music
[11:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> or rate movies
[11:14] <liq3> You know, this all comes back to school.
[11:14] <liq3> Oh my god.
[11:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> because it's their fault the entertainment industry is declining
[11:14] * liq3 facepalms.
[11:14] <Yourself> it's not declining, it's adapting to new tastes and markets
[11:14] <Yourself> you're just stuck in the past
[11:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> and it is stupid
[11:14] <kwerty> I really liked world of warcraft, although I stopped playing two years ago. Then again I'm a huge warcraft lorenerd :(
[11:14] <Speljohan_Laptop> i abolished it
[11:15] <Naserve> Come watch LuciferZ draw nude chicks http://www.livestream.com/blockcast
[11:15] <liq3> Yourself: I played Thief 2 yesterday. It's better then pretty much every SP game released in the past 5 years.
[11:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> thief 2 is epic
[11:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> and i agree
[11:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> thief 3 was really good too
[11:15] <liq3> Well, ok I'm pretty wrong...
[11:15] <liq3> I mean AAA games. :P
[11:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> :P
[11:15] <liq3> Not stuff like World of Goo or Aquaria.
[11:15] <Yourself> and you think there would be no one that would disagree with you?
[11:15] <liq3> I'm sure there would be.
[11:15] <Yourself> that's the whole point
[11:15] <Speljohan_Laptop> there's always tons of people who disagree
[11:15] <liq3> I extremely doubtful anyone could come up with a logical argumente against me though.
[11:15] <Yourself> you're trying to make it out as if it's objectively declining
[11:15] <Yourself> it's not
[11:16] <Speljohan_Laptop> problem is, the "true" gamers are being neglected by the market
[11:16] <liq3> It is...
[11:16] <Speljohan_Laptop> hence why we turned to indie
[11:16] <liq3> The big companies have gone to "pump out horse shit because it makes the most money".

[11:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> ^
[11:21] <liq3> It's also an Ad Hominem.
[11:21] <Yourself> an ad hominem would be "you're wrong because you're an absolute moron"
[11:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> MTV was awesome in the early 90's
[11:21] <LuciferZ> Good night all
[11:21] <whatdoesth> Now they show everything BUT music videos. Therefore, as a "Music Television" station, they are failing.
[11:21] <liq3> ...Hang on, link time.
[11:21] <Speljohan_Laptop> they actually played underground stuff in the 90's whatdoesth

[11:22] <Naserve> Smells Like Teen Spirit was played on MTV all the time when it came out. I wish they still played music
[11:22] <liq3> Generic music videos have no scenes that last longer then about 5 seconds.
[11:22] <whatdoesth> Games, likewise, have shifted away from being games, and onto being pretty, having cutscenes, and having graphics almost exclusively, leaving the actual purpose, PLAYING A GAME, behind.

[11:24] <whatdoesth> "Easy" and "Hand holding" partially comes from the shift in what people think a game is "supposed" to be. It's not about playing the game, it's about looking at that explosion, and feeling good that you won.
[11:24] <liq3> Yep.
[11:24] <Yourself> somehow this doesn't seem to be correct
[11:24] <liq3> That last one is pretty much the most important part...
[11:24] <liq3> Making the player think they "won".
[11:24] <kwerty> http://failblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/129177350041524683.jpg I guess the abortion laws are pretty loose over there?
[11:24] <Yourself> i never seem to have a shortage of games that i enjoy and think are good
[11:24] <liq3> Which works on every casual player. They don't realise the game is stupidly easy and they didn't achieve anything.
[11:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> you are lucky Yourself
[11:25] <Yourself> for example, i think each simcity in the series is an improvement over its predecessor
[11:25] <whatdoesth> Yeah. The impression of "winning" without actually doing or accomplishing anything can be described in a single word.
[11:25] <Shadaez> Halo Reach is terrible
[11:25] <whatdoesth> "Shallow"
[11:25] <Yourself> mass effect 2 was better than mass effect one
[11:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> same Yourself but when was the last simcity?
[11:25] <liq3> Yep.
[11:25] <Yourself> GTA IV is fucking amazing
[11:25] <liq3> Best example is WoW.
[11:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> exactly my point here.
[11:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> the past 5 years have been awful generally
[11:25] <liq3> People think hitting level 80 in WoW is some kind of achievement. It's not. ANYONE can do it.
[11:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> anyone with enough time/money

[11:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> i am an rts and rpg person
[11:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> well strategy overall
[11:26] <Yourself> naturally the half life series, though it's been a while
[11:26] <liq3> The terrible games like Conviction have almost no immersion.
[11:26] <Yourself> i enjoyed sins of a solar empire
[11:26] <Yourself> i liked dawn of discovery
[11:27] <Yourself> kind of had an AoE feel to it
[11:27] <Speljohan_Laptop> sins of a solar empire was pretty good
[11:27] <whatdoesth> Sins of a Solar Empire is pretty borderline indie though
[11:27] <Speljohan_Laptop> ^
[11:27] <Yourself> an AoE meets simcity kind of thing
[11:27] <Yourself> i've been enjoying Civ 4
[11:27] <Yourself> definitely improved upon Civ 3
[11:27] <liq3> Aquaria, World of Goo, Gish, Thief 2, SC2...
[11:27] <liq3> Frozen Synapse.
[11:27] <liq3> 4 out of 6 are indie. :P
[11:27] <Yourself> Torchlight was a nice modernized take on diablo
[11:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> i disliked torchlight
[11:28] <liq3> Same.
[11:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> i loved diablo though
[11:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> it lacked the dark gritty feeling
[11:28] <liq3> Diablo 2 is the only isometric RPG I've liked.
[11:28] <whatdoesth> Torchlight was a half-assed diablo clone trying to cash in on the Warcraft style.
[11:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> ^
[11:28] <Yourself> and i liked it
[11:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> my fav rpg is still baldur's gate 2

[11:29] <Speljohan_Laptop> will probably never change
[11:29] <Speljohan_Laptop> etc
[11:29] <Rithiur> Torchlight is great. It just lacks a bit of depth and multiplayer.

[11:33] <Yourself> wtf are you talking about?
[11:34] <Speljohan_Laptop> to prevent us from being mindless slaves to the system
[11:34] <Yourself> yeah, the educational system is going downhill
[11:34] <Yourself> it was designed for the industrial age
[11:34] <Speljohan_Laptop> they actually taught people to question everything

[11:34] <whatdoesth> I think denying the possibility that quality is deteriorating is just as bad as insisting it's happening where it is not.

[11:37] <Speljohan_Laptop> the US is too busy trying to be world police and leaders to think about the consequences of their actions
[11:37] <liq3> Speljohan_: Actually I think they very well know it's doing that, and they want it to.

[11:37] <Speljohan_Laptop> the education, no doubt liq3
[11:37] <liq3> And make the middle as low as possible.
[11:37] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's designed to not teach everything

[11:43] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol, the tax is probably higher here
[11:43] <darkedone02> I perfer politics and government learning stuff on my class and not economy, i'm not that good at math...
[11:43] <Yourself> <liq3> something like 90% of the wealthi in the US is owned by 10% of the population.
[11:43] <Yourself> that really isn't uncommon

[11:43] <liq3> mmmmmmm
[11:44] <Yourself> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> well, except for
[11:44] <liq3> optional?
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> books and stuff if ur 20+ yrs old
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> elementary school is mandatory
[11:44] <liq3> Yes.
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> then you can do as you wish
[11:44] <liq3> That's a problem. :]
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> but it's impossible to get a job if you don't
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> hence you'll be poor all ur life
[11:44] <liq3> That's also a problem.
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's the way the world works
[11:44] <liq3> The whole "if you don't have a diploma I won't ever check your resume" thing is stupid.
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> cannot change that without a massive reform
[11:44] <Speljohan_Laptop> uhh, it's usually not like that liq3
[11:45] <liq3> It's what everyone tells me.
[11:45] <Speljohan_Laptop> i was hired with no credentials shown
[11:45] <Yourself> <liq3> The whole "if you don't have a diploma I won't ever check your resume" thing is stupid.
[11:45] <Speljohan_Laptop> they just wanted to see my java skills
[11:45] <Speljohan_Laptop> that was it

[11:45] <liq3> Yourself: Not in Australia.
[11:45] <Yourself> oh, here it is
[11:45] <liq3> I know a GED is trivial.
[11:45] <Speljohan_Laptop> we have like 40-50 schools that are practical though liq3
[11:45] <Yourself> i did practically nothing in high school
[11:45] <Speljohan_Laptop> which lets you get a job without the theory stuff
[11:45] <Yourself> failed english twice
[11:45] <liq3> in Australia it's basically impossible without going thru school.
[11:45] <Yourself> still graduated
[11:45] <liq3> Me? I 'll probably NEVER have a diploma, ever.

[11:46] <Speljohan_Laptop> especially the programming courses
[11:46] <Speljohan_Laptop> 3 fucking courses in java

[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> and i finished them on an afternoon
[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> the "hardest" thing they had was oop
[11:47] <liq3> It was so goddamn easy I ended up dropping out because I wasn't showing up to due to boredem.
[11:47] <liq3> I even asked them if I could the course faster, and they said "no".
[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> mh, kinda what i did my last term liq3
[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> we can do it as fast as we want tho
[11:47] <liq3> I would have stayed and just turned out like 2 days a week.
[11:47] <liq3> And just done the homework.
[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> we dont have homework either
[11:47] <liq3> EXCEPT, they required me to turn up to pass.
[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> wee
[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> err
[11:47] <Speljohan_Laptop> did*
[11:48] <Speljohan_Laptop> cus
[11:48] <Speljohan_Laptop> our college focused on making it more like the working-market
[11:48] <Speljohan_Laptop> so we had 2x 3 hour lessons every day
[11:48] <Speljohan_Laptop> where we took breaks when we wanted to etc
[11:48] <liq3> Well our homework was mostly easy stuff, finishing stuff we didn't in class, and studying.
[11:48] <liq3> Not HS style homework.

[11:49] <liq3> lol.
[11:49] <liq3> Yeh.
[11:49] <liq3> I remember back in uh...
[11:49] <liq3> High School.
[11:49] <Speljohan_Laptop> the only subject i've ever put any effort into was mathematics
[11:49] <liq3> I was in this thing called "Adavanced math", basically doing math a year ahead of everyone else. This one test I barley studied for, and still came like 3rd out of the class.
[11:49] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[11:49] <liq3> oh I remember now.
[11:49] <liq3> In year 10, I was only showing up half the time.
[11:50] <liq3> Missed tons of math classes.
[11:50] <Speljohan_Laptop> heh
[11:50] <liq3> And didn't do ANY homework.... I still beat half the class.
[11:50] <liq3> I was like "wut?"
[11:50] <Speljohan_Laptop> i love how so many people think math is important for a programmer
[11:50] <liq3> It's not... You just need logical thinking. :/
[11:50] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's not important whatsoever
[11:50] <Speljohan_Laptop> a simple google search and bam, you have what you need
[11:50] <liq3> I mean stuff like vectors and vector projection is important for colision detection.
[11:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> buuut
[11:51] <liq3> yeh.
[11:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> you don't need to know the math
[11:51] <liq3> You can learn the stuff in a week or 2 easy.
[11:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> all you need is a simple google
[11:51] <liq3> When you need it.
[11:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> with a programmer's explanation
[11:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> and it's done
[11:51] <Rithiur> Math is very important in some fields of programming. And the solving skills required for mathematical problems are relevant in all programming.
[11:51] <kwerty> We don't have colleges here in Finland. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_form_college I guess that's pretty much the closest thing before university
[11:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> the solving part is true Rithiur
[11:51] <liq3> Rithiur: elementary math is problem solving.
[11:51] <Speljohan_Laptop> but actual calculations aren't
[11:51] <liq3> It's rote memorization.

[11:53] <Speljohan_Laptop> i prefer designing applications structure-wise, write frameworks etc
[11:53] <Speljohan_Laptop> hence why i'm perfect as a java consult :P
[11:53] <Rithiur> But it's not like you need more than some high school math for most programming problems. It's just that if you suck at math, you will most likely suck at programming too.

[11:57] <liq3> I didn't actually bother eading the code. :(
[11:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> god, that was terrible

[12:01] <liq3> I'd just make the corners more pretty.
[12:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> building the shape from pixels
[12:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> instead of quads
[12:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> it would generate a model based off the image

[12:01] <liq3> bah.
[12:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> this stores no permanent models though
[12:02] <liq3> There's some thing that uses PCD to render gfx and is well... supposed to be infinitely better then the current polygon model.
[12:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's all generated at runtime
[12:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> mario isn't even a model as such

[12:23] <Speljohan_Laptop> terrain deformation isn't that advanced either lol
[12:23] <liq3> I know...
[12:23] <liq3> I'd probably just use voxels.
[12:23] <Speljohan_Laptop> mh
[12:24] <liq3> you got a better idea/
[12:24] <liq3> ?
[12:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> depends on how you intend to do it
[12:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> i'd probably do it in a tile-based fashion
[12:24] <liq3> Well... Caves... and units walking on the walls/cielings of thosec aves.
[12:24] <liq3> The caves need to be carvable with units. :P
[12:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> yeah i understand that
[12:25] <liq3> I wouldn't have a clue how to do that without voxels...
[12:25] <liq3> I mean I guess something like a L4d nav mesh.
[12:25] <liq3> I have no idea how to make those tho.

[12:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> i'd probably just have the world in a tile-based fashion overall
[12:25] <liq3> what do you mean?
[12:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> minecraft-ish, perhaps with much smaller blocks representing the world
[12:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> or
[12:26] <liq3> Well that's what I mean by voxels.
[12:26] <liq3> :P
[12:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> oh ok
[12:26] <Mikel> Hey all, I just read the hacking thing on wiki. Does that work in Indev?? or just in like the free build single player??
[12:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[12:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> i'd probably optimize it something like
[12:26] <liq3> MC is basically voxels imo.
[12:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> all blocks are big in the beginning
[12:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> when you mine a block into a wall
[12:26] <liq3> Mikel: hacking?
[12:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> it transforms into several small blocks
[12:27] <liq3> hrm.
[12:27] <Speljohan_Laptop> and all surrounding blocks do that as well
[12:27] <Speljohan_Laptop> to save polycount etc
[12:27] <Mikel> The thing to change blocks into other blocks
[12:27] <liq3> Speljohan_: I wish I knew how to do that. :(
[12:27] <Speljohan_Laptop> that's not hard at all liq3
[12:27] <liq3> Mikel: it should.
[12:27] <Speljohan_Laptop> say, you have a square block that is 4x4x4 units large
[12:27] <liq3> Speljohan_: I dunno how to do stuff like pathfind etc with dynamic terrain.
[12:27] <Mikel> Hmmm alright... Cause i wouldnt mind getitng lots of tnt ^^
[12:27] <Speljohan_Laptop> chop it up to 2x2x2 and place several of them within the boundaries of that unit
[12:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> then 1x1x1
[12:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> etc
[12:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> down to size you want
[12:28] <liq3> Well ok...
[12:28] <liq3> What if we had a 10x10 and dug a 2x2 hole in the middle? :P
[12:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> no problem, only the chopped block is affected
[12:28] <liq3> wouldn't that need like 4 new blocks?
[12:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> and surrounding blocks if required
[12:28] <Speljohan_Laptop> it would
[12:29] <liq3> Oh Ok I get how you'd render that.
[12:29] <Speljohan_Laptop> but it would be more gpu/cpu friendly than having all blocks as voxels initially
[12:29] <liq3> A sorted list or something?
[12:29] <Speljohan_Laptop> probably not even required
[12:29] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[12:29] <Speljohan_Laptop> just have a basic lookup
[12:29] <liq3> I mean...
[12:29] <Speljohan_Laptop> getBlockAt(x, y, z)
[12:29] <liq3> You can't render the ENTIRE thing at once can you? :/
[12:29] <Speljohan_Laptop> of course you can :P
[12:29] <liq3> -_-
[12:30] <Speljohan_Laptop> hell, thanks for the idea
[12:30] <Speljohan_Laptop> brb setting up an example demo
[12:30] <liq3> :p
[12:30] <Speljohan_Laptop> i'll give you source when done
[12:30] <liq3> o.O
[12:30] <liq3> ETA?
[12:30] <Speljohan_Laptop> (note i have never done anything like this)
[12:30] <Speljohan_Laptop> will be an interesting experiment
[12:30] <Speljohan_Laptop> i duno
[12:30] <liq3> Oh right, that's why I fail at motivation.
[12:31] <Speljohan_Laptop> by the end of next weekend maybe?
[12:31] <liq3> Goddamn people...
[12:31] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[12:31] <Speljohan_Laptop> probably earlier
[12:31] <Speljohan_Laptop> but
[12:31] <liq3> I fail at motivation because I have no social support. :(
[12:31] <Speljohan_Laptop> i bet i'll lose motivation somewhere
[12:31] <Speljohan_Laptop> and stop work for a day or two
[12:31] <liq3> lol.
[12:31] <liq3> :P
[12:31] <liq3> My problem is stuff like.
[12:31] <liq3> How the hell do I do pathfinding on these broken blocks?
[12:32] <Speljohan_Laptop> perhaps
[12:32] <liq3> I suddenly have a tunnel a lot of units can problem pathfind over. :(
[12:32] <Speljohan_Laptop> have a "mask" block
[12:32] <Speljohan_Laptop> eg
[12:32] <Speljohan_Laptop> the initial block is a masked area
[12:32] <Speljohan_Laptop> when chopped down, blocks in masked area are adjusted
[12:32] <liq3> Oh I know how.
[12:32] <Speljohan_Laptop> then if the pathfinder gets there
[12:32] <Speljohan_Laptop> check flags on area
[12:32] <liq3> Use a nav mesh like L4D.
[12:32] <Speljohan_Laptop> what size blocks are
[12:33] <liq3> except it's a more 3d nav mesh.
[12:33] <Speljohan_Laptop> and adjust algo
[12:33] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[12:33] <liq3> When the bolck is broken, update it, and generate more into the tunnel.
[12:33] <Speljohan_Laptop> ps example will be in java when lwjgl
[12:33] <Speljohan_Laptop> with*
[12:33] <liq3> OH GODDAMN IT.

[13:23] <liq3> ...what's a display list? >.>
[13:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> similar to a function
[13:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> it stores a set of opengl calls
[13:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> which are compiled into the gpu memory
[13:24] <Speljohan_Laptop> to speed up rendering
[13:25] <liq3> k.
[13:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> in this case it stores a quad
[13:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol
[13:25] <Speljohan_Laptop> a box
[13:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> so basically in the current implementation it is used like:
[13:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> GL11.glTranslatef(position.getX(), position.getY(), position.getZ());
[13:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> GL11.glColor3f(255.0f, 255.0f, 255.0f);
[13:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> list.call();
[13:26] <Speljohan_Laptop> in the render function of Block class

[13:48] <Speljohan_Laptop> which from start is 2x2x2 units large
[13:48] <Speljohan_Laptop> then it will divide that size and create new blocks to make the spacing as large as the player is

[13:57] <Speljohan_Laptop> shouldn't be too hard in this system tbh
[13:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> just split blocks diagonally instead
[13:58] <liq3> yeh.
[13:58] <liq3> basically. :]
[13:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> get rotation of player and apply to calculation
[13:58] <liq3> Have stuff like 12 sided "spheres"
[13:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol no need
[13:58] <Speljohan_Laptop> it is all made up of blocks
[13:59] <Speljohan_Laptop> with a high enough resolution diagonal paths will look smooth
[13:59] <Speljohan_Laptop> although it's a terrible way to do it and it would eat cpu as hell
[13:59] <Speljohan_Laptop> lolol
[13:59] <Speljohan_Laptop> this is intended for low-res
[13:59] <Speljohan_Laptop> so that you can still see it is blocks
[13:59] <liq3> wel.l
[14:00] <liq3> Cutting blocks non-cubelike would be required. :P
[14:00] <liq3> altho not really.
[14:00] <liq3> Actually it'd be kinda interesting using a destruction system that is what you're doing, but has a max resolution.
[14:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> that will be for another rainy day
[14:00] <liq3> Intentionally low res. o.o
[14:00] <Speljohan_Laptop> lol

[14:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> yes
[14:01] <Speljohan_Laptop> it's not hard
[14:01] <liq3> Couldn't figure the damn thing out.

[14:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> in an rts it's almost 2d picking actually
[14:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> height is already defined by a height map
[14:02] <Speljohan_Laptop> then do project/unproject on mouse location

[14:05] <copyboy> okay, this might get me kicked/banned but it's to funny to not show around: http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=cb6a6904d88f1cf93dd6b3e96b0a4d9d
[14:06] <Speljohan_Laptop> i should totally make a pokemon rts liq3 !
[14:06] <Speljohan_Laptop> 150 different unit types omg
[14:06] <liq3> ROFL.
[14:06] <liq3> and you can just copy all the types. :P
[14:06] <Speljohan_Laptop> ya
[14:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> and catch pokemon in da world to get more units
[14:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> like gaia in aoe
[14:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> lolol
[14:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> pokecenter builds nurse joy's that heal
[14:07] <Speljohan_Laptop> !
[14:07] <liq3> >.> <.<
[14:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> i'd have quite a few balancing issues on my hands in such a situation though
[14:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> balance for 150 units? no thanks
[14:08] <Speljohan_Laptop> would definately be funny as hell though
[14:09] <Speljohan_Laptop> however, it would probably be an awesome game

[19:14] <Cat> <exe> real time strategies etc
[19:14] <Cat> and FPS
[19:14] <[JD]> made a castle with a 3 story building in it, and a huge amount of catacombs below

[19:14] <[JD]> with a tree farm :P
[19:14] <Quatroking> Right now I'm doing some pretty big stuff regarding a 14x30x20 room or something
[19:15] <Quatroking> shit's big
[19:15] <[JD]> i even seeded grass down to the tree farm
[19:15] <descention> [JD]: how about way to capture mobs and send the mto the lava depths?
[19:15] <[JD]> what you gonna make the room into?
[19:15] <[JD]> lol
[19:15] <[JD]> to your doom mobs!
[19:16] <descention> i used to trap them in a water moat

[19:20] <[JD]> notch needs to make it so when your picaxe and other tools wear out, that if you have a simular tool in your bag it takes its place, that way you don't loose whatever your mining
[19:20] <Quatroking> My current project: http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/5/13111224073-orig.jpg
[19:20] <[JD]> and make it easier to continously mine
[19:20] <[JD]> :o
[19:20] <[JD]> thats a very large room
[19:21] <descention> i could think of other improvements to the client i'd prefer
[19:21] <[JD]> yeah, but that one would be a simple if, then statement when a tool breaks :P
[19:21] <descention> probably
[19:21] <Quatroking> I think it would be really awesome if Notch added the UploadScreenshot API

[19:25] <[JD]> =D
[19:25] <Quatroking> I'll just dig a little further
[19:25] <Quatroking> You can't stack chests you see, so I build them in walls

[19:27] <[JD]> i think you would have had to move everything over by one
[19:27] <[JD]> to make it look alright
[19:27] <Quatroking> but then I'd need more space
[19:27] <Quatroking> to stock the extra rock

[21:25] <bildramer> you have seen nothing
[21:25] <bildramer> I got over 140 blocks from a coal vein once
[21:25] <Hackwode> wow! Not bad
[21:25] <Hackwode> are you guys on infdev?
[21:25] <Quatroking> Yeah
[21:25] <Quatroking> bildramer, coal stinks
[21:26] <bildramer> :l
[21:26] <Hackwode> infdev is amazing, except the day/night cycle
[21:26] <Quatroking> I can't use iron for equipment and shit
[21:26] <Quatroking> uh
[21:26] <Hackwode> and the limited water
[21:26] <Quatroking> *coal
[21:26] <Quatroking> derp
[21:26] <Hackwode> water should've remained infinite
[21:26] <Luingar> naw
[21:26] <Wervyn> You can use coal to make iron for equipment and shit, though.
[21:26] <Quatroking> oh hey this vein goes even further
[21:26] <Luingar> not infinate, but it definately needs physics
[21:26] <Quatroking> wervyn: true, but do you know how much stuff you can process using 64 coal?
[21:26] * Flowi (arcadiex@74.193.159.221) has joined #minecraft
[21:26] <Wervyn> I mean I guess you could cut down a forest too, but coal just seems much more efficient.
[21:27] <Quatroking> Really, its a lot
[21:27] <Wervyn> A fuckton, I know.
[21:27] <vurtual> 8*64
[21:27] <Wervyn> But I just dump coal into my furnace array and forget about it, so I can always pump out a ton of whatever really fast without having to worry about fuel.
[21:28] <Quatroking> alright, got me another 20 chunks
[21:28] * Cat (RazeGal@109.92.81.40) has joined #minecraft

[21:31] <Luingar> ...
[21:31] <Luingar> ya know what?
[21:31] <Quatroking> I bet all the minecraft animals have some kind of down syndrome
[21:31] <Quatroking> its not normal that they constantly run in circles and off cliffs
[21:31] <Wervyn> I remember when I used to just punch sheep to shear them for wool, because I thought the wool grew back later. And now it's like screw that, die sheep.
[21:32] <Quatroking> I don't use any wool
[21:32] <Wervyn> Neither do I, but I collect it anyway.
[21:32] <Hackwode> Is there grit in infdev yet?
[21:32] <Wervyn> Eventually there'll be dyes of some sort, and you'll be able to make art with it.
[21:32] <Hackwode> also, wool is REALLY good for making traps
[21:32] <Quatroking> "grit"?
[21:32] <Luingar> 9 dirt should equal condensed dirt, 9 condensed dirt should equal coal, 9 coal should equal condensed coal, 9 condensed coals should equal hyperconensed coal, 9 hypercondensed coal should equal crystal.
[21:33] <Luingar> anyone second the above?
[21:33] <Hackwode> you build wool across a cavern, and set fire to it
[21:33] <Hackwode> I disagree, Luingar
[21:33] <Quatroking> what the hell is grit
[21:33] <Hackwode> grit...where you get flint?
[21:33] <Hackwode> you know, shingle
[21:33] <Luingar> we need something to do with dirt
[21:33] <Wervyn> Gravel?
[21:33] <Quatroking> Oh you mean gravel
[21:33] <Hackwode> gravel
[21:33] <Luingar> squatro, gravel
[21:33] <Hackwode> that's the word
[21:33] <Quatroking> Yeah, there's gravel in infdev
[21:33] <Hackwode> I haven't found any yet
[21:33] <Quatroking> takes a while to find but its there
[21:33] <Hackwode> must look harder
[21:33] <Hackwode> near water, right?
[21:33] <Firetempest> near beaches often
[21:33] <Hackwode> right, right
[21:34] <Quatroking> Actually they are beaches of gravel
[21:34] <Quatroking> once you find it there's lots of the stuff tho
[21:34] <Marach-17> seriously, why is there a "portal 2" category in moddb
[21:34] <Quatroking> for the lulz
[21:35] <Hackwode> You know once you find one piece of gravel, it's pretty much a permanent source of flint?
