[0:01] <chrbarrol> maybe you should ask in the forum.
[0:01] <Pl0x> mmm I will later.
[0:01] <Pl0x> do you think it's a bug?
[0:01] <Pl0x> well if I change the size to Normal it works fine
[0:01] <LG_Legacy> What Pl0x?
[0:01] <Pl0x> <.<
[0:02] <LG_Legacy> Some maps are weird like that
[0:02] <Pl0x> Legacy: someone please explain to me, why I die when I create a map then I drop from the sky and get insta ko?
[0:02] <LG_Legacy> It spawns you in funny places.
[0:02] <Pl0x> this is after creating a map: Size = Small Theme = Paradise, Shape = Deep Type= Island
[0:02] <LG_Legacy> Just try again and again
[0:02] <Pl0x> no
[0:02] <Pl0x> ok
[0:02] <LG_Legacy> Also
[0:02] <Firetempest> only works with custom blocks that give proper speed boosts and jumps, but still impressive, like lining up a gym full of dominos
[0:02] <LG_Legacy> Pl0x
[0:02] <LG_Legacy> Since you've gotten a taste of Indev or Infdev...
[0:02] <Pl0x> yea?
[0:02] <LG_Legacy> Take a peek at this: http://lglegacy.tumblr.com/post/554451279/apparently-i-overdone-my-base Is my base overdone?
[0:02] <Marach-12> it's not hard to create an auto level
[0:03] <Marach-12> it's hard to make it MATCH THE MUSIC
[0:03] <Pl0x> No
[0:03] <Pl0x> It's awesome
[0:03] <Pl0x> :)
[0:03] <LG_Legacy> Take a look at the high res
[0:03] <Brett> mine is twice the size :P
[0:03] <LG_Legacy> People want me to make sky bridge.
[0:03] <mnjiman> Marach-12 holy shit... that's got to be the most awesome video i've ever seen. - -- -- - - -I love you
[0:03] <LG_Legacy> I might do so and connect it to the main
[0:03] <Pl0x> Do it
[0:03] <chrbarrol> The dumb thing about minecraft is that when you've made an OP fort there isn't much more to do.
[0:03] <Marach-12> :D
[0:03] <LG_Legacy> It'll take a while.
[0:04] <Brett> more than half of my base is an indoor farm, though
[0:04] <Marach-12> i have to watch it whole.
[0:04] <Pl0x> will be epic when finished
[0:04] <Marach-12> then once again
[0:04] <LG_Legacy> I have some crops growing inside, but i never use em.
[0:04] <LG_Legacy> Meat is a main source.
[0:04] <Pl0x> oh btw it spawned me in the sky again
[0:04] <mnjiman> Marach-12, will you marry me?

[0:04] <Marach-12> i wonder how is the music played.

[0:04] <Pl0x> ...and again
[0:05] <Pl0x> still in the sky but facing a different way this time :(

[0:35] <LG_Legacy> They help once they run out of puncs.
[0:35] <LG_Legacy> Puns*
[0:35] <Pl0x_1> Then someone like Legacy can along and my luck got better
[0:35] <LG_Legacy> Or until i ban one of them.

[0:36] <MC_fanatic> Marafk-12: Never have good expectations about anyone you've known fo0r under amount
[0:36] <LG_Legacy> Fleur is just a annoying 16 year old who has nothing better to do but bug me.
[0:37] <Pl0x_1> Lol
[0:37] <Marafk-12> in one of library computers, i replaced firefox shortcut with a message saying that the true firefox icon is on the right
[0:37] <LG_Legacy> TO THE MINECRAFT FORUMS
[0:37] <Pl0x_1> Do I bug you?
[0:37] <MC_fanatic> I'm listening :D
[0:37] <LG_Legacy> You don't ping me for stupid reasons.
[0:37] <LG_Legacy> So no.
[0:37] <Marafk-12> 8/10 people didn't even read it, they just tried 5 times to open the browser, then went to another computer.
[0:37] <Pl0x_1> LOL

[0:38] <LG_Legacy> Quatroking You can back me up here.
[0:38] <Pl0x_1> Ping you... he wants to find out where you live
[0:38] <KodaichiZero> zombies.
[0:38] <Marafk-12> 2nd remaining person had to ask a friend why it doesn't work, then they figured it out themselves
[0:38] <LG_Legacy> Yes he does.

[0:49] <eritz> should i do it?
[0:49] <Marafk-12> no
[0:49] <eritz> VC and SA were actually pretty fun games
[0:50] <eritz> probably the two best entries in the franchise
[0:50] <MC_fanatic> If they redid SA i would buy it. Better graphics like
[0:50] <MC_fanatic> Just plain FUN
[0:50] <Firetempest> i like the over the top comedic style of the older GTA games, not so much 4s.
[0:50] <LG_Legacy> Hm..
[0:50] <eritz> GTA4 wasn't that good
[0:50] <eritz> i loved GTA:VC's setting

[2:13] <darkedone02> but hey, THQ make some good games, they also made Dawn of War series, 1 and 2
[2:13] <AndrewPH> all of my weapons in D2L are penises

[2:14] <KodaichiZero> you know
[2:14] <Quatroking> AndrewPH, exactly
[2:14] <darkedone02> love them.... but don't know if i want to work with them.
[2:14] <AndrewPH> and the spaceship is a giant penis
[2:14] <Quatroking> also my D2L character is a walking butt
[2:14] <SpaceManiac> Hawaiian_Eskimo, put minecraft_server.jar in the same folder as OMEN, that ought to work
[2:14] <AndrewPH> my d2l character is a red bird with penises for legs

[2:14] <KodaichiZero> I bet that if Rochelle from L4D2 was slightly insane, so many more poeple would actually respect her as a playable character

[3:13] <Yourself> also there are tetrachromic females
[3:13] <FoxtrotZero> This entire room is shades of black and grey for me. Yay for custom skins!
[3:13] <Yourself> so, from their point of view, most people are color blind
[3:14] <FoxtrotZero> tetrachromic?
[3:14] <FoxtrotZero> And i can see colors fine
[3:14] <Yourself> most humans have only 3 types of cones
[3:14] <Yourself> each sensitive to some portion of the EM spectrum
[3:14] <Yourself> which is why all of our display technologies are based on the RGB colorspace
[3:14] <Eagle> and the one that's responsible for green or something is messed up for me
[3:14] <czahrien> I know my issue is with red. I definitely see it, I just don't see it as strongly as I should. This causes problems with identification of some greens, browns, yellows, oranges, and purples.
[3:14] <Eagle> Oh.

[3:15] <Eagle> and I was like D:
[3:15] <czahrien> What does grass look like to you, grey?

[3:15] <Yourself> making them sensitive to a 4th portion of the EM spectrum

[3:16] <czahrien> I've heard there are two variants of tetrachromc females: Ones that see more colors in the purple range and another type that see more colors in the yellow range.
[3:16] <Yourself> something like that
[3:17] <czahrien> I haven't heard of a fourth type of cone that sees a mystical color that is outside of the visible spectrum

[4:05] <FoxtrotZero> I have a friend, he gets those events all the times where you sieze up in a half-dream state. Usually freaky things happen, because people are scared shitless, but he's familiar enough with them that better things happen.
[4:05] <FoxtrotZero> I've hed it several times, but I managed to snap myself out quickly enough, and hallucinations just never came.
[4:05] <vurtual> I'm too alert to just fall asleep while awake.
[4:06] <FoxtrotZero> Just the same, i rarely remember dreams, and just the same I might just not sleep deep enough to dream, as I sleep pretty short amounts.
[4:06] <LG_Legacy> You and all of your friends are dead.
[4:06] <FoxtrotZero> I can run a full day on six hours of sleep, three times in a row
[4:06] <FoxtrotZero> Dead, are we now?
[4:06] <vurtual> LG_Legacy, you're dead?
[4:06] <vurtual> :(!?
[4:06] <vurtual> 6 hours is pretty good if you just sit around all day
[4:06] <FoxtrotZero> Well, thats true
[4:07] <vurtual> Not so good if you have to cross heavy thick terrain on foot.

[4:10] <FoxtrotZero> I've contemplated contemplating suicide, if that makes any sence, but only at the peak of my occasional depression. Which rarely just happens, it takes something to trigger it.

[4:10] <CruelNoise> heh
[4:11] <FoxtrotZero> You took that at face value?
[4:11] <vurtual> babbling, dropping all your clothes.
[4:11] <FoxtrotZero> Thats just because one has difficulty sleeping like that.
[4:11] <vurtual> That kind of stark raving mad happens when you try a 28-hour day
[4:11] <vurtual> no no it's because you can't pull it off alive
[4:11] <FoxtrotZero> Honestly, one of the few things I CANNOT do is go to sleep knowing the sun is out.
[4:11] <FoxtrotZero> Hence, i couldn't actually pull of a 28 hour day
[4:11] <Rooster> Good luck sleeping in Alaska
[4:11] <FoxtrotZero> But, given my way, i would have nothing comperable to a schedule
[4:11] <FoxtrotZero> Alaska, i could sleep in
[4:11] <Rooster> Don't they have like, 12 hour days?
[4:12] <Rooster> Full bright?
[4:12] <CruelNoise> in alaska, the sun shines all day for part of the year
[4:12] <CruelNoise> also, for a slightly shorter part of the year, the sun never shines
[4:13] <Rooster> Lol Alaska
[4:13] <CruelNoise> if i was forced to live anywhere in the united states, it would be alaska
[4:13] <CruelNoise> or vurtual's basement. they're probably about the same size

[4:26] <FoxtrotZero> I like reading and pictures
[4:26] <Rooster> agreed
[4:27] <FoxtrotZero> Anyway, i think I remain one of the intelligent people on the forum.
[4:27] <Rooster> This community is full of...stupid people
[4:27] <Beardbeard> Just make a post with a bunch of pictures of cats. The new people will look at that and not bother posting anywhere else.
[4:27] <Rooster> Nice job being humble
[4:27] <FoxtrotZero> We're not a dying breed, we're just outnumbered.
[4:27] <FoxtrotZero> I try to be humble, but theres no comparison here.

[4:30] <LG_Legacy> English gfuys
[4:30] <shapeshiftr> The game.
[4:30] <`Delta`> Never fail to freak me out.
[4:30] <Estust1> Atleast creepers dont launch other creepers at you. Yet.
[4:30] <Cial> that would be cool
[4:30] <`Delta`> DON'T SAY THAT!
[4:30] <SpaceManiac> That would be terrible
[4:30] <FoxtrotZero> It loses its ring in english
[4:30] <Beardbeard> I speak Engrishu vely gooda, mistel.
[4:30] <Estust1> Me and lego were talking about it theo ther day :3

[4:30] <LG_Legacy> Anyways
[4:31] <LG_Legacy> Do tell why you look highly FoxtrotZero
[4:31] <FoxtrotZero> I liked the artic look
[4:31] <Estust1> And you see on the cliff, about 20 blocks away from the tip of your tower
[4:31] <Cial> a giant creeper that when it explodes fires other creepers at you
[4:31] <Estust1> A group of creepers congregate
[4:31] <Estust1> You swear you see one making death trheats at you
[4:31] <`Delta`> I didn't even see it coming
[4:31] <Beardbeard> A giant creeper that fires creepers that fire creepers that fire skeletons.
[4:31] <`Delta`> I was crafting
[4:31] <`Delta`> in one of my mines
[4:31] <FoxtrotZero> I don't know, i see you as a semi-mature person who knows what they're doing and has been around for a while. Thats enough to get respect from me, and you've done nothing to lose it.
[4:31] <`Delta`> and all of a sudden..
[4:31] <Estust1> One creeper grabs hold of the other, aims it, and teh creeper is flung towards you. At the top of your castle.
[4:31] <`Delta`> SSSSSSS
[4:31] <LG_Legacy> Semi?
[4:31] <Estust1> And it exploders you
[4:31] <`Delta`> Yes
[4:31] <FoxtrotZero> THIS is why you close your doors
[4:31] <`Delta`> and my heart dies
[4:32] <Beardbeard> Skeletons that fire arrows that spawn skeletons.
[4:32] <`Delta`> ..
[4:32] <`Delta`> I have no doors.
[4:32] <`Delta`> :<
[4:32] <Estust1> I hated that
[4:32] <Estust1> xD
[4:32] <`Delta`> I should fix that
[4:32] <Estust1> Back when arrows spawned
[4:32] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[4:32] <ClassiestMedic> that'd be epic
[4:32] <FoxtrotZero> Delta, try a lava pump
[4:32] <FoxtrotZero> Wait, i'm getting ahead of the game again
[4:32] <Estust1> Have you tried using rope?
[4:32] <FoxtrotZero> You know
[4:32] <`Delta`> lava pump?
[4:32] * Varriount is now known as Meh
[4:32] <FoxtrotZero> If you had torches, they wouldn't spawn
[4:32] <Beardbeard> Lava pumps should only be makeable using wood.
[4:33] <Estust1> No beard
[4:33] <`Delta`> I did have torches!
[4:33] <Estust1> Wood is flammable
[4:33] <Estust1> We shoudl use cloth
[4:33] <FoxtrotZero> Yes, i came up with an idea that has doorway bridges rained with lava, but it takes pumps
[4:33] <Beardbeard> Ah, great idea.
[4:33] <FoxtrotZero> Do you have torches EVERYWHERE?
[4:33] <Beardbeard> Cloth is sturdy enough to support the weight.
[4:33] <`Delta`> No :<
[4:33] <Estust1> Indeed
[4:33] <FoxtrotZero> If theres a dark spot, they will spawn and find you
[4:33] <Estust1> There has to be atleast one black cloth you know
[4:33] <Estust1> For black power.
[4:33] <Beardbeard> I would love it if we could make little blocks of iron with lava inside.

[4:33] <Estust1> No
[4:33] <Estust1> Black.
[4:33] <`Delta`> TORCHES EVERYWHERE

[4:34] <Estust1> Gray only has half of the mitochlorians as a black cloth
[4:34] <Estust1> White cloths use electrolytes
[4:34] <`Delta`> so do creepers only spawn underground?
[4:34] <Estust1> Electrolytes are only good for pumping water
[4:34] <FoxtrotZero> Who knows what happens when you mix one part zinc with two parts hydrochloric acid
[4:34] <FoxtrotZero> They only spawn in the dark
[4:34] <Estust1> Creeper?

[4:35] <Estust1> I say we discuss our plans for multiplayer infinites
[4:35] <FoxtrotZero> Beard, stop trolling
[4:35] <LG_Legacy> Tf2 update
[4:35] <LG_Legacy> Beardbeard is not trolling, he's just being a twat.
[4:35] <Estust1> Listen everyone
[4:36] <Beardbeard> I am not trolling. The little bastards find you everywhere.
[4:36] <Estust1> I say we each build a spire
[4:36] <FoxtrotZero> For those who don't know, you get Hydrogen Gas and Zinc Chloride
[4:36] <Beardbeard> Then they blow up the ground and you fall into a cave
[4:36] <Estust1> 25x25 and rounded
[4:36] <Beardbeard> A cave full of skeletons
[4:36] <Estust1> Out of stone
[4:36] <Estust1> And connect them with roads
[4:36] <LG_Legacy> http://store.steampowered.com/news/3765/ No really TF2 fixes and crap
[4:36] <SpaceManiac> I build my homes out of gold
[4:36] <FoxtrotZero> Whats the point?
[4:36] <Estust1> To make a bunch of spires for no real reason
[4:36] <Beardbeard> I build my homes out of diamond.
[4:36] <SpaceManiac> iron usually works
[4:36] <Estust1> Or, we could construct towers in an octagonal pattern and fill in teh spaces between their tops
[4:36] <FoxtrotZero> I can't STAND gold. I HATE gold. Silver, i like, but gold, i can't stand the yellow sheen.
[4:37] * lobster_MB (michielbra@86.89.201.189) has joined #minecraft
[4:37] <SpaceManiac> it's iron
[4:37] <Beardbeard> That's not silver.
[4:37] <Estust1> And create an artificial piece of land up there using dirt and smelted rock
[4:37] <SpaceManiac> to quote notch
[4:37] <SpaceManiac> "No, really!"
[4:37] <FoxtrotZero> Anyone ever heard about real life?
[4:37] <SpaceManiac> :P
[4:37] <Estust1> I heard thatw as a good game
[4:37] <Estust1> Never tried it though, ratings are bad
[4:37] <FoxtrotZero> No, it really did suck
[4:37] <Estust1> Good, i didnt waste my money
[4:37] <Estust1> They charge you for food!
[4:37] <Estust1> Food!
[4:37] <Estust1> I honestly dont get that game at all
[4:37] <FoxtrotZero> But the multiplayer has connections like you wouldn't believe! There is no lag!
[4:37] <Estust1> Psh
[4:38] <Estust1> I heard about this one guy jesus
[4:38] <FoxtrotZero> And the campaign is so open ended
[4:38] <Estust1> He lagged so bad
[4:38] <Estust1> It took him 3 days to respawn
[4:38] <FoxtrotZero> Well, most people don't respawn. Server glitch.
[4:38] <Estust1> Damn
[4:38] <FoxtrotZero> Yea.
[4:38] <Estust1> Does it have any magic system?
[4:38] <FoxtrotZero> No, but they put in something called science, its sorta cool.
[4:38] <Estust1> Cool
[4:39] <Estust1> Magic got boring
[4:39] <FoxtrotZero> It did, kinda
[4:39] <Estust1> So whats this science
[4:39] <Beardbeard> Science is pretty much like hacking.
[4:39] <FoxtrotZero> Well, everything follows a set of rules, and everything is made of matter.
[4:39] <Estust1> So
[4:39] <Estust1> ..
[4:39] <FoxtrotZero> And matter interacts with other kinds of matter, and you can do all sorts of stuff with this./
[4:39] <Estust1> With science only!?
[4:39] <FoxtrotZero> Yep.
[4:39] <Beardbeard> Hacking, man.
[4:39] <Estust1> Holy shit
[4:39] <Estust1> Thats epic
[4:39] <LG_Legacy> FoxtrotZero Making pictures like those is my specialty
[4:39] <Estust1> So, can i turn other matter into other matter
[4:40] <Beardbeard> Yep.
[4:40] <Estust1> Like, if i got a piece of rock could i turn it into a sirloin steak?

[4:41] <Estust1> What happens then?
[4:41] <FoxtrotZero> Yea, but they're adding to the skill every twenty years or so
[4:41] <Beardbeard> then you fight these really tough mobs. A lot of people die shortly afterwards.
[4:41] <Estust1> Cool
[4:41] <Estust1> And what about the money
[4:41] <Estust1> How does it work?
[4:42] <Beardbeard> Depends on your country.
[4:42] <FoxtrotZero> Right
[4:42] <Estust1> If i shoot someone, will i get money?
[4:42] <Beardbeard> Yeah, you get money if you fuck bitches too.

[4:43] <FoxtrotZero> Well the game isn't designed for killing

[4:44] <Beardbeard> There's these weak players that like to hang around in the shops.
[4:44] <Beardbeard> If you bring a weapon in you can usually get em to fork over their cash and gear.
[4:44] <FoxtrotZero> You can also make your own money, but if you get caught, the OP's fuck you up

[4:44] <Estust1> Where do people get money
[4:44] <SpaceManiac> oh, and teamkilling is generally bad
[4:45] <Estust1> I mean, how do they get their money?
[4:45] <SpaceManiac> especially with zero respawning
[4:45] <Beardbeard> They farm for the rich asshats.
[4:45] <Estust1> So theres farming
[4:45] <Beardbeard> Then they give their mats to said asshats, who then price gouge it to hell
[4:45] <Estust1> Like grinding?
[4:45] <Beardbeard> Yeah.
[4:45] <Beardbeard> You get exp for EVERYTHING you do, though
[4:45] <Estust1> What sort of mobs do they kill?
[4:45] <Beardbeard> I hear some of em tame beasts and then kill em
[4:45] <Beardbeard> Then they sell the drops to people.
[4:45] <Estust1> For teh extra exp?
[4:46] <Beardbeard> Yep.
[4:46] <Estust1> So, thats all you can do?
[4:46] <Beardbeard> Nah man, the possibilities are endless.
[4:46] <FoxtrotZero> For the record, gentlemen, I am talking to you from in-game, and screenshotting.
[4:46] <setveen> moo
[4:46] <Beardbeard> After you hit level 18 you can choose which type of job you want.
[4:46] <Estust1> Cool
[4:46] <Estust1> Whats it liek before level 18, though?
[4:46] <FoxtrotZero> Pretty tought
[4:46] <Beardbeard> Boring as fuck.
[4:46] <FoxtrotZero> All a tutorial
[4:46] <Beardbeard> Yeah.
[4:46] <Estust1> Damn
[4:47] <Beardbeard> At 18 you can do advanced tutorials for your job
[4:47] <shapeshiftr> Is the game actually fun after level 18?
[4:47] <FoxtrotZero> Can be
[4:47] <setveen> what game you guys talking about?
[4:47] <Beardbeard> 4 years for easy ones, and 8 years for good ones
[4:47] <Estust1> Its something called real life
[4:47] <setveen> never played it
[4:47] <Estust1> I might try it, there just describing it
[4:47] <Estust1> Anyway
[4:47] <Estust1> Are there vehicles?
[4:47] <Beardbeard> So many vehicles.
[4:47] <Estust1> Spacejets?
[4:47] <Beardbeard> Some crazy bastards even have animal mounts.
[4:48] <Beardbeard> No one has the recipes for spacejets yet, but they're pretty close
[4:48] <Estust1> Oh
[4:48] <Estust1> So no one has a high enough science level?
[4:48] <GarryH> hey, is that a kind of game or something?
[4:48] <Beardbeard> They do, but there's different specializations
[4:48] <shapeshiftr> yeah, real life.
[4:48] <Estust1> Sounds fun
[4:48] <Beardbeard> For some reason people don't want the spec that gives you spacejets.
[4:48] <Estust1> Thats stupid
[4:48] <Beardbeard> I know.
[4:48] <Estust1> Well
[4:48] <Beardbeard> They'd rather study the bits of data in the game.

[4:49] <Estust1> About how many people play it?
[4:49] <GarryH> is that a game?
[4:49] <GarryH> an rpg or something
[4:49] <Estust1> Yeah
[4:49] <Beardbeard> Geez man, like, 3 trillion or so?
[4:49] <Estust1> Apparantly
[4:49] <shapeshiftr> I heard something about the SysOps being corrupted.
[4:49] <Estust1> Damn
[4:49] <GarryH> whats the naem
[4:49] <GarryH> ?
[4:49] <Estust1> And they all fit on one server?
[4:49] <Beardbeard> It's a pretty popular game.
[4:49] <Beardbeard> Yeah, but the server's divided into sections called countries
[4:49] <FoxtrotZero> Doesn't cost much, either
[4:49] <FoxtrotZero> Ohh, yea
[4:49] <FoxtrotZero> And you need to pick a class called race
[4:49] <Beardbeard> There's general personality types in different countries.
[4:50] <shapeshiftr> Dude, i heard one guy lost all his money because he played that game.
[4:50] <GarryH> guys?
[4:50] <Estust1> Its called Real Life garry
[4:50] <GarryH> wow
[4:50] <Estust1> So, beard. who made the game?
[4:50] <GarryH> i hate that game
[4:50] <shapeshiftr> And one of the countries, USA? The server is crashing ATM due to the economy system being hacked.
[4:50] <Beardbeard> No one's really sure. Some people think this God dude did, but others think it just sort of started existing.
[4:50] <Beardbeard> Yeah, the GMs need to fix that.
[4:51] <Estust1> Lol, thats stupid
[4:51] <FoxtrotZero> Some people say it was by some lead director called god, but others say it kind of grew into its own thing
[4:51] <Estust1> Any head GM then?
[4:51] <GarryH> do u ever playd minecraft on real life?
[4:51] <Beardbeard> There's head GMs for each different country.
[4:51] <shapeshiftr> Well, there are a few, called presidents. they don't do much, though.
[4:51] <GarryH> my avatar is doing thatright now
[4:51] <Estust1> So
[4:51] <FoxtrotZero> They used to have Kings, and you did what they said or you got banned.
[4:51] <`Delta`> Yaaay
[4:51] <Beardbeard> the one from the Poland place recently got killed by a Russian hacker though
[4:51] <`Delta`> I have armor
[4:51] <Estust1> How does the whole modding sstem work on server USA then?
[4:51] <`Delta`> :D
[4:52] <Beardbeard> Well, the players elect the head GM and his sub GMs. It's kind of nice really.
[4:52] <FoxtrotZero> But they're all electing asshats
[4:52] <Estust1> Lol
[4:52] <Beardbeard> But they're all bickering about how to fix the economy hack.
[4:52] <Beardbeard> They can't get shit done and all the players are getting pissed.
[4:52] <FoxtrotZero> And now in all this jackassery, they're fucking up and ruined the economy. Broke the game, they did.
[4:52] <Estust1> They should just shoot the people hacking it
[4:52] <Beardbeard> They're threatening to switch countries.
[4:52] <FoxtrotZero> I'm actually going to
[4:52] <shapeshiftr> I really liked USA server for a while, I had my own house.
[4:52] <Estust1> Oh yeah
[4:52] <FoxtrotZero> Everyone on the sever is a jackass, anyway
[4:52] <Animator> A majority of the players in U.S.A. are just bots with standard A.I.
[4:53] <Estust1> Any godpowers and stuff the mods have? Or is it just fair throughout
[4:53] <Animator> Well, supposedly there was this one guy named Jesus.
[4:53] <Estust1> I heard of him
[4:53] <FoxtrotZero> right, hell of a player
[4:53] <GarryH> guys.. i hate real life
[4:53] <GarryH> i preffer the sims
[4:53] <GarryH> XD
[4:53] <Animator> Said to be extreme uber-hacker elite. Walked on water and everything.
[4:53] <Estust1> He lagged teh shit out of the server, liek i said earlier
[4:53] <Beardbeard> Yeah, Jesus was some sort of amazingly skilled player.
[4:53] <GarryH> oh yeah
[4:53] <Beardbeard> A bunch of haters say he hacked.
[4:53] <GarryH> i heard of him
[4:53] <Estust1> Wasnt he the programmers son?
[4:53] <Beardbeard> I think so.
[4:53] <FoxtrotZero> Some guy said he was the only one to get around the no-respawn glitch
[4:54] <GarryH> did u know they made an fanclub 4 him?
[4:54] <Estust1> The programmer prolly just gave him some special things and whatnot
[4:54] <Beardbeard> Yeah.
[4:54] <Estust1> So whats this water stuff?
[4:54] <Beardbeard> He could also instantly cure debuffs.
[4:54] <GarryH> the admin probably know jesus
[4:54] <Animator> Some people think that respawning exists but your entire inventory is wiped and you start fresh.
[4:54] <Beardbeard> Well, he was able to treat the water terrain like it was land.
[4:54] <Estust1> Damn
[4:54] <Estust1> The respawn system sounds sucky
[4:54] <Malikat> yeah but i hear he dupes
[4:54] <FoxtrotZero> Yea, and some said he could do some uber science kinda like magic
[4:55] <GarryH> it sucks realy
[4:55] <Malikat> he had like 100 bread and duped it to get 900
[4:55] <Beardbeard> The people with the science profession are working on fixing the respawn.
[4:55] <Estust1> Any use to the water, btw?
[4:55] <GarryH> u dont actually know what happens if u lose an life
[4:55] <Beardbeard> Or at least trying to raise the level cap, to make people last longer.
[4:55] <Estust1> Heh
[4:55] <GarryH> some guys believe u respawn..
[4:55] <Estust1> So
[4:55] <Estust1> The higher your level
[4:55] <Estust1> The higher science level you can get?
[4:55] <GarryH> kinda
[4:55] <SpaceManiac> well, to an extent
[4:55] <IceFlinger> If you work at it
[4:55] <Beardbeard> Well, not always.
[4:55] <Estust1> ?
[4:55] <GarryH> im at level 14 now
[4:55] <Beardbeard> Some higher level players are really rude.
[4:55] <GarryH> it sucks
[4:56] <Animator> Others eblieve that there's some sort of higher-plane extra bonus level the programmer made just for the people who believe in him.
[4:56] <GarryH> oh yeah
[4:56] <Beardbeard> Like, if a level 87 sees a level 16 walk near him
[4:56] <IceFlinger> My character is crap on this game though
[4:56] <Beardbeard> He'll wave a shotgun at em
[4:56] <shapeshiftr> I heard Jesus_ had a Science skill of >9000, so that he could manipulate matter to his liking. He even replenshed the Hunger and Thirst bars of 1,000 players with just one fish!
[4:56] <IceFlinger> I really wanna start over
[4:56] <Estust1> Lol
[4:56] <GarryH> YEAH
[4:56] <GarryH> thats true
[4:56] <Estust1> Damn
[4:56] <Animator> Bahahahahaha.
[4:56] <Estust1> So
[4:56] <GarryH> he was a really fucking addicted
[4:56] <Estust1> What kind of mobs do they have!?
[4:56] <IceFlinger> Although I just got to lv 16
[4:56] <IceFlinger> which has a few awesome perks
[4:56] <Beardbeard> Man, they have everything.
[4:57] <Beardbeard> The water mobs are the worst, though. NEVER go there without a high level ship.
[4:57] <Animator> Normal mobs. Some speculate paranormal mobs.
[4:57] <GarryH> hey do u got the virginity loss perk?
[4:57] <FoxtrotZero> Level 14 here, i'll be Lvl 15 soon, though
[4:57] <Estust1> Grats
[4:57] <Animator> Others speculate the undead, or some mob named Bigfoot.
[4:57] <SpaceManiac> You know what bothers me
[4:57] * Smashing (Smashing@adsl-82-161-164.jax.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[4:57] <GarryH> i heard its awesome
[4:57] <SpaceManiac> no matter how hard you try
[4:57] <SpaceManiac> you always level up at the same rate
[4:57] <FoxtrotZero> Yea
[4:57] <AndrewPH> Beardbeard, so tell me, why did you spam penises on 2 D3 servers?
[4:57] <Estust1> Lol that sucks
[4:57] <GarryH> yeah!
[4:57] <Beardbeard> There's also this mob called "Bear"
[4:57] <FoxtrotZero> But you need to keep going or you never level
[4:57] <Estust1> So if I started playing right now I'd be level 0?
[4:57] <Beardbeard> Never go against one without high level gear.
[4:57] <GarryH> thats the worst part of the game
[4:58] <Beardbeard> Sadly yes, estust.
[4:58] <Beardbeard> You spawn in a hospital.
[4:58] <Estust1> O_o?
[4:58] <Estust1> Why?
[4:58] <Animator> If the spawn even works.
[4:58] <Estust1> So
[4:58] <Animator> Some spawns don't even make it that far.
[4:58] <GarryH> i can just win enough xp in the other year
[4:58] <Beardbeard> Yeah, it has a 5% chance to just kill you.
[4:58] <FoxtrotZero> Yea, and it takes two other players to create you, and two years later you get shoved out of a girl.
[4:58] <Estust1> When you signup theres a chance they wont let you in?
[4:58] <Beardbeard> Pretty much.
[4:58] <GarryH> yeah
[4:58] <Beardbeard> The servers are too crowded.
[4:58] <Estust1> Damn

[4:58] <GarryH> in some levels yeah
[4:58] <Estust1> So
[4:58] <Beardbeard> Especially the African one.
[4:58] <Animator> The Chinese servers are ridiculously crowded.
[4:59] <shapeshiftr> And there are these other mobs called aliens that cause major lag wherever they go, as the server can't process them yet. Only a few people with really great GPUs actually could stay at 1fps long enough to see them.
[4:59] <Estust1> After i get spawned, theres a tutorial till lvl 18
[4:59] <Beardbeard> Yeah, but china manages to make it work
[4:59] * LG_Legacy is now known as Afk_Legacy

[4:59] * AgentSmith is now known as Skynet
[4:59] <Beardbeard> The Sierra Leone server sucks the most.
[4:59] <GarryH> it sucks
[4:59] <`Delta`> BR!
[4:59] <Beardbeard> They live in tin shacks.
[4:59] <Estust1> Low science?
[4:59] <Animator> The Haiti server went down recently. So did the Chile server.
[4:59] <FoxtrotZero> Theres actually some players that try to prevent other players from getting in the game, trying to glitch the game mechanics with science
[4:59] <Beardbeard> Low science and economy.
[4:59] <GarryH> very low science
[4:59] <GarryH> yeah
[5:00] <SpaceManiac> Yeah

[5:06] <AndrewPH> steal from it
[5:06] <Estust1> Where?
[5:06] <GarryH> u need to get credits
[5:06] <shapeshiftr> It's really annoying game. It has this crazy learning curve, like Dwarf Fortress, but once you get the hang of it around level 18, it has its ups
[5:06] <Estust1> I mean, theres no other people around
[5:06] <GarryH> the polite way
[5:06] <Estust1> I see some weird hings over there. Theyre brown and have some horn thingys

[5:44] <Rooster> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3oAHDdWSos&feature=related
[5:44] <Eztuzt> So, when Kevin Bacon use pronouns, replace Kevin Bacon with Kevin Bacon?

[5:44] <LG_LEgacy> BRREEAAKKKFFAAASSSTTT
[5:44] <FoxtrotZero> indeed
[5:44] <vede> FoxtrotZero, I think we'd have to replace all first or second person verbs with their third-person counterpart.

[5:54] <LG_LEgacy> The word Faggot kind of .. Well, i disapprove of the word.

[5:54] <Iguana> Animator, they've been banned before, just show them proof, and they'll fuck off.
[5:54] <Darkebrz> But it's just a figure of speech
[5:54] <Darkebrz> I could say dickface then
[5:54] <Animator> Because when you piss them off, you piss of the Test of Dummy, and when you piss him off, you piss me off, and both of us start dishing out bans.

[6:01] <Fleur> 'lg O.o how's it okay to tell someoen to rape a baby
[6:01] <Fleur> lol
[6:01] <LG_LEgacy> No
[6:01] <LG_LEgacy> I meant
[6:01] <Iguana> Sounds almost as good as the Plains of Elsyrdfwhateverthehellitis.
[6:01] <Iguana> I want in.
[6:01] <LG_LEgacy> Don't tell someone to go into #furry and do that
[6:01] <Sord213> Of what?
[6:01] <LG_LEgacy> He got banned.
[6:01] <Sord213> :o
[6:01] <Fleur> ohh
[6:01] <Fleur> sorry
[6:01] <Fleur> lol
[6:01] <Fleur> LOL
[6:02] <Animator> Attacking another goddamned community after we just went though a story of not doing it.
[6:02] <Fleur> he actually did it?
[6:02] <LG_LEgacy> Yes he did it.
[6:02] <FoxtrotZero> Ahh, well, i'm banned from there, and its not something i do on a regular basis if it helps
[6:02] <EmpiresBane> who did?
[6:02] <Sord213> What happened when on then?
[6:02] <Fleur> thats like someone listening when you tell them to delete system32 cause its a virus
[6:02] <LG_LEgacy> I specifically said do not piss off #Furry
[6:02] * Fleur sigh
[6:02] <FoxtrotZero> Yea, unfortunately Dropbox is down, so i can't share my proof.
[6:02] <Darkebrz> I specifically yelled it
[6:02] <Darkebrz> FoxtrotZero, NOBODY CARES
[6:02] <LG_LEgacy> Fleur That is a differently channel
[6:02] <LG_LEgacy> Different rules
[6:02] <LG_LEgacy> He didn't know the rules
[6:02] <Darkebrz> Oh wow, you managed to fail troll a channel with a few furries!
[6:02] <LG_LEgacy> And i bet you didn't either or you purposely did
[6:02] <FoxtrotZero> I didn't care about the rules
[6:02] <Darkebrz> Everyone loves you now!
[6:03] * Jackomel (jck@host-146-088.consiagnet.it) has joined #minecraft
[6:03] <Fleur> i managed to troll a channel with someone else xd
[6:03] <FoxtrotZero> Dark, i didn't do it to be cool, i did it because I wanted to, so please shut the fuck up.
[6:03] <Fleur> i've only been in furry once
[6:03] <Darkebrz> So why do you have to prove it?
[6:03] <EmpiresBane> oh shit! i gotta turn of auto-reoin
[6:03] <vurtual> I should MAP THE INTERNET
[6:03] <Fleur> I don't remember reading anything other then something that scared me for life
[6:03] <Sord213> DO IT
[6:03] <FoxtrotZero> Bindun
[6:03] <FoxtrotZero> Why would autorejoin be worthy of a ban?
[6:03] <vurtual> Take every major internet location, down to semi-popular IRC channels I know.
[6:03] <FoxtrotZero> That makes NO sence.
[6:03] <Sord213> :o
[6:03] <Sord213> Do
[6:03] <Sord213> It
[6:04] <FoxtrotZero> Its been done
[6:04] * LG_LEgacy sets mode +b *!*@cpe-24-166-42-56.neo.res.rr.com
[6:04] <vurtual> Then map the relativel likelihood of someone being on one of the networks also being on some network, and then construct a massive network.
[6:04] <LG_LEgacy> BAN HAMMER
[6:04] <FoxtrotZero> By XKCD, twice
[6:04] <EmpiresBane> FoxtrotZero, because it's against the rules...?
[6:04] * Fleur was kicked from #minecraft by LG_LEgacy
[6:04] <vede> FoxtrotZero, because it completely defeats the purpose of kicking.
[6:04] <FoxtrotZero> Well, touche
[6:04] <tentacos> get out
[6:04] <LG_LEgacy> Anyways
[6:04] <Sord213> Pow, hahaha!
[6:04] <Animator> Or you do it.
[6:04] <Darkebrz> Kicks are basically meant as temporary bans
[6:04] <FoxtrotZero> What did Fleur do, then?
[6:04] <vurtual> THen, I can get a statistic probability of someone being x or y.
[6:04] <Darkebrz> Not for hours, but just a few minutes
[6:04] <Sord213> I like kicking stuff :o
[6:04] <vurtual> kicks are like slapping your hand, really hard
[6:04] <Sord213> That's a temporary ban?
[6:04] <vurtual> so your hand blows off and grows back, like in Men in Black.
[6:04] <whatdoesth> Actually, temporary bans are meant as temporary bans.
[6:04] <Darkebrz> vurtual, they are like kicking you actually
[6:04] <LG_LEgacy> Oh come on, Fleur technically attacked or tried to troll #Furry with another user.
[6:04] <FoxtrotZero> How would it keep you out for several minutes? You press rejoin and thats it.
[6:05] <vurtual> except instead of your head, it's your hand.
[6:05] <FoxtrotZero> LG, that I will submit to.
[6:05] <LG_LEgacy> I specifically told you guys not to piss off #Furry
[6:05] <vede> FoxtrotZero, that's also pretty stupid.
[6:05] <Sord213> Wait wait wait. What happened?
[6:05] <LG_LEgacy> And he went ahead and told FoxtrotZero that
[6:05] <vurtual> Except the users are like the de-flashed agent... J?
[6:05] <LG_LEgacy> Plus he was getting on my nerves and constantly annoying me.
[6:05] <vurtual> "How did you know my head would grow back?" "It grows back?"
[6:05] <FoxtrotZero> Vurt, it was K, not J
[6:05] <vede> If you get escorted out of a building, you don't just walk back in when you get pushed out the door, do you?
[6:05] <FoxtrotZero> J never got flashed
[6:05] <vurtual> Agent-not-will-smith
[6:05] <coladash> bye
[6:05] <LG_LEgacy> So overall: Trolling/Annoying an op/Puppeting our users.
[6:05] <FoxtrotZero> vede, i damn well do
[6:05] <coladash> hey vurtual
[6:05] <LG_LEgacy> I frown apon this
[6:05] <Sord213> Attention people. What is happening talk about? I hate not knowing convos.
[6:06] <FoxtrotZero> Oh, well, i trolled #furry
[6:06] <vurtual> Sord213, men in black and ethics of being kicked
[6:06] <whatdoesth> I'd walk right back in if they said "You can come back in whenever you want."
[6:06] <Sord213> Dang bro
[6:06] <Sord213> I hate trolls
[6:06] <Sord213> Except... When they are funny.
[6:06] <LG_LEgacy> Anyways
[6:06] <FoxtrotZero> Would someone like to go over there and tell them i'm sorry, or do I have to change my tag?
[6:06] <FoxtrotZero> No matter.
[6:06] <Animator> I really should call on Notch to restructure the IRC rules to fit these in.
[6:07] <vede> 4srs
[6:07] <Sord213> Wait, there's rules?!?!?!
[6:07] <Sord213> Lol jk
[6:07] <vurtual> Or make your own minecraftian network
[6:07] <FoxtrotZero> Which reminds me that i need to check the forum.

[6:07] <RaidSoft> it's 4:07 in Sweden atm :P
[6:07] <LG_LEgacy> Someone offered a network for minecraft
[6:07] <vurtual> Then I'd have no reason to be on esper though, and the network's relatively bearable compared to others.
[6:07] <Darkebrz> Wait RaidSoft said
[6:07] <RaidSoft> AM, that is
[6:07] <LG_LEgacy> Notch didn't give a response
[6:07] <Darkebrz> *What
[6:07] <Darkebrz> LG_LEgacy, ew no
[6:07] <Sord213> It's 9:07 PM where I am
[6:08] <Darkebrz> Minecraft doesn't need a network
[6:08] <FoxtrotZero> I load my wireless mouse like a shotgun
[6:08] <FoxtrotZero> 7PM in cali rite nao
[6:08] <Sord213> This discussion has changed to: Times

[6:08] <Sord213> :D
[6:08] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[6:08] <vurtual> This is the only network, I've ever been on
[6:08] <ClassiestMedic> and you deserve it :D
[6:08] <vurtual> Where using /list was a sane idea
[6:08] <vede> I'm on three networks right now.
[6:08] <Sord213> what does /list do?

[6:09] <Sord213> Ah
[6:09] <Sord213> k
[6:09] <vurtual> Now, for sanity reasons, I do not do that.
[6:09] <vurtual> Not code-sanity reasons, not because it'd be insane
[6:09] <Sord213> Why?
[6:09] <vurtual> But because I'd go insane.
[6:09] <Sord213> How so?
[6:09] <vurtual> Because some channels were never meant to be seen by human eyes.
[6:09] <Sord213> I trust your judgment :D
[6:10] <vurtual> esper's saner though
[6:10] * FoxtrotZero uses /list
[6:10] <vurtual> Hot off the massive-information-presses, runescape makes an easter egg reference to df.
[6:10] <FoxtrotZero> [INFO] List reply will appear on the ???irc.esper.net??? view.

[6:14] <Miclee> Guild Wars is awesome.
[6:14] <vurtual> then again getting addicted to guild wars makes you like Arzock.

[7:06] <vurtual> well, normal I guess
[7:06] <Darkebrz> vurtual, how do you play online with such a bad connection?
[7:06] <vurtual> I didn't notice, and I airblasted a pyro. It hit the rocket I didn't see straight into the pyro, gibbing him with a minicrit.
[7:06] <vurtual> "bad connection"?
[7:06] <vurtual> My pings are, normally, plazing fast.
[7:06] <vurtual> also
[7:06] <vurtual> "playing with bots"

[7:07] <Darkebrz> Yeah okay
[7:07] <vurtual> I have the higest ping rating on pingtest.
[7:07] <Firetempest> now i feel like i should reload tf2 again...
[7:07] <vurtual> Sentries are nerfed now.
[7:07] <vurtual> indirectly
[7:07] <vurtual> If you airblast their rockets back, it minicrits, and can kill someone at the sentry
[7:08] <Darkebrz> vurtual, wait you can airblast sentry rockets?
[7:08] <Darkebrz> OH MY JESUS I HAVE BEEN DOING IT WRONG FOR SOOOO LONG

[7:11] <vurtual> infact a chargin' demo cannot actually hurt you.
[7:11] <vurtual> They have no weapons capible of damaging anyone who can airblast
[7:11] <vurtual> Their charges are blasted back, and so are their grenades

[7:16] <Katnipz> you can't run right at it
[7:16] <vurtual> so?
[7:16] <vurtual> wait for level 3, use the minicrit deflefct to send the engie flying off again
[7:16] <Katnipz> so the pyro wouldn't be a god to them
[7:17] <Katnipz> he/she wouldn't be able to get very close rendering the flame thrower useless
[7:17] <Katnipz> the invincibleity would run off to fast
[7:17] <Katnipz> i think it would only last for like 1.5 seconds
[7:17] <Katnipz> any more and it would be to long
[7:18] <Katnipz> got to go
[7:19] <Katnipz> i leave you with my tweet to notch to ask you if you think it would be awesome
[7:19] <Katnipz> Catnipz @xnotch you should add epic Hand to Hand combat where you can snap necks in great detail! and smash monsters with your knees!
[7:19] <Katnipz> :P
[7:20] <EmpiresBane> that would be terrible
[7:20] <Katnipz> i know :P

[7:20] <Katnipz> nonoo
[7:20] <EmpiresBane> it feels like you're not doing anything

[8:11] <vurtual> operating the lever between shots, like in doom.
[8:11] <Konogan> Oh gosh, if I had the skill to make some adequate graphic...
[8:12] <vurtual> Having quakely speed and jumping, and a doom-like scout face in the bottom, that changes to your teamcolor version of the class face for the extra weapons.

[8:14] <vurtual> Then a quakey chaingun for the heavy weapon, grenadelauncher for the demo, rocket launcher for the soldier, hp-draining normal-looking needlegun for the medic, an engineer wrench that works like an impact hammer
[8:14] <FoxtrotZero> I interrupt.
[8:14] <FoxtrotZero> Violently.
[8:14] <FoxtrotZero> With shuriken.
[8:14] <FoxtrotZero> There were no survivors.

[8:15] <FoxtrotZero> Yes. Except for Konogan.
[8:15] <vurtual> and I

[8:15] <vurtual> even though I visibly died ifnront of everyone
[8:15] <vurtual> Like how Aragorn did.
[8:15] <pl0x> how long does a night last in minecraft, like in real time...
[8:15] <vurtual> 15min
[8:15] <FoxtrotZero> No, Vurt, I killed you first. I put three in your neck.
[8:15] <vurtual> but I came back
[8:16] <FoxtrotZero> No. Stop godmodding.

[8:17] <vurtual> me too
[8:17] <darkedone02> one time at 2fort, I got around 12 heads without dying
[8:18] <vurtual> After swinging the knife, your cloak-bar drains to 0, making you plainly visible, then after one second, it starts filling back up to whatever value it is. The bar percent is how invisible you are, and moving=lowers the max

[8:18] <Yourself> there was an update today
[8:18] <vurtual> That's 10 different weapons, it'd be a decent fps.
[8:18] <Yourself> which is what i'm sure spurred the conversation in that direction
[8:18] <darkedone02> yeah, there is an update that added a new map.
[8:18] <Yourself> they nerfed fire damage even more
[8:19] <darkedone02> ans did some fix and adjustments
[8:19] <Yourself> and buffed the airblast
[8:19] <vurtual> Yourself, airblast.
[8:19] <vurtual> Pyro is WAY buffed now.
[8:19] <Yourself> making anyone who's still using backburner look that much dumber
[8:19] <vurtual> pyro used to be questionably powerful
[8:19] <vurtual> Now he's unquestionably deadly.
[8:19] <vurtual> A good airblast can take out a sentry nest instantly
[8:19] <Yourself> they buffed the heavy, though

[8:19] <Yourself> and reduced the time it takes to spin up

[8:20] <vurtual> darkedone02, airblast.
[8:20] <vurtual> well yeah heavy's pretty chargable

[8:21] <FoxtrotZero> Alas, I cannot defend from anything.
[8:21] <FoxtrotZero> Of course, once i get the lavapump deal set in, i'll have my keep DEEP underground, with the enterance deep in my castle. The minecart network that goes around the castle will go to the elevator, which goes one hundred blocks down, surrounded entirely by lava. The switch is hidden in the enterance hall. The curtains of lava cease, and from the cart bay you descend into the rows after rows of...
[8:21] <FoxtrotZero> ...chests stocked with the castles supplies. Markers denote the contents. Your needs are collected, at which point you return to the cart bay, proceed through the hall (making sure to reactivate the lava defences), go BACK up the elevator, and proceed back into the cart network.
[8:21] <Yourself> except you almost never get behind people and you have to line it up fucking exactly
[8:21] <FoxtrotZero> Thats right.
[8:22] <vurtual> You mean the switch guards
[8:22] <vurtual> a secret area

[8:27] <darkedone02> this happen when it just came out.
[8:28] <darkedone02> I was pretty happy, I've been bottle and shield fighting till I get the eyelander.
[8:28] <Yourself> you still don't have the eyelander?
[8:29] <mnjiman> Minecraft and DF need to combine forces.. so DF can become 3d using minecraft engine
[8:29] <darkedone02> then I got the eyelander after completing most of the achievements... mostly all of them.
[8:29] <mnjiman> that would be sick
[8:30] <darkedone02> I think all of them... one thing that I was missing was my buff banner for my soldier, I got the pickaxe, the gunboats, and the new rocket launcher.... just need the gun boats and the new weapons and items out there.
[8:30] <Yourself> i only just got the gunboats last week

[8:31] <pl0x> do I still get night?
[8:32] <vede> pl0x, no. Paradise has no night time.
[8:32] <Konogan> DF in 3D = Easier Interface = Less Difficulty = Less Losing and as "Loosing is fun." = Less fun. So, DF in 3D = Less fun.
[8:32] <pl0x> oh ok.
[8:32] <Azathoth> do mobs still spawn in paradise?
[8:32] <vurtual> I wonder if I submitted JC2-style hats for TF2, they'd be put in without anyone noticing.
[8:32] <pl0x> Yea
[8:32] <vurtual> DF wouldn't be easier in 3D
[8:32] <pl0x> do mobs still spawn?

[9:11] <vurtual> Well then, fine sir, considering the harshness of your actions and your outlandish behaivor, I must label YOU the troll!
[9:11] <FoxtrotZero> Touche.
[9:11] <Marafk-12> you would be a troll if someone actually agreed with you
[9:11] <Azathoth> <vurtual> you is trollin!
[9:11] <Azathoth> <FoxtrotZero> i'm not trollin!
[9:12] <FoxtrotZero> Thats a false statement
[9:12] <Azathoth> your life is a false statement
[9:12] <FoxtrotZero> It is not.
[9:12] <vurtual> No Azathoth, you are the false statement.
[9:12] <vurtual> and then Azathoth was a lie.
[9:12] <Azathoth> :D
[9:12] <FoxtrotZero> You mean like the cake?
[9:13] <FoxtrotZero> Shit, I just lost the game.
[9:13] <Marafk-12> you know, killing you and giving you good advice aren't mutually exclusive.
[9:13] <Yourself> this is a false statement
[9:13] <FoxtrotZero> While that is true, the latter would nullify the former, where as the former might be able to nullify the latter.

[9:16] <vurtual> the update broke it

[9:16] <vurtual> In specific, the very specific update, just now, made the sdk broke.
[9:16] <Azathoth> i agree with vede
[9:16] <FoxtrotZero> Gentlemen, I refer you to the following http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/pix_plz.png
[9:16] <vurtual> Nothing before, an update today.
[9:17] <vurtual> Anyways, every dm game eventually gets ctf.

[9:20] <Azathoth> seriously though
[9:20] <Azathoth> i know people who talk like him in real life
[9:21] <vede> Also, FoxtrotZero, you can hardly claim 'superior speech patterns' when your messages contain some pretty noticeable grammatical errors.

[9:28] <Adura> They've explained it.

[9:28] <Azathoth> google can do things right

[9:28] <Nyarlathotep> Yes
[9:28] <Nyarlathotep> The most sucessful search engine of all time
[9:28] <Codlike> I was looking too far down on it
[9:28] <Azathoth> youtube just sucks cock because it's laggy as hell
[9:28] <Nyarlathotep> clearly cant do anything right
[9:28] <Codlike> didn't look up there
[9:28] <vede> Yes, he did. Tisk freaking tisk.
[9:28] <Azathoth> not because it's owned by google
[9:28] <FoxtrotZero> Its not even the lag, its the piece of shit interfaces.

[9:29] <vede> Nyarlathotep, I don't agree with FoxtrotZero, but that was a really bad argument.
[9:29] <Nyarlathotep> How so?
[9:29] <vede> Success doesn't necessarily mean you did anything right.
[9:29] <vede> Just look at Microsoft.
[9:29] <Nyarlathotep> I've yet to see a better search engine
[9:29] <Azathoth> looool
[9:29] <FoxtrotZero> Vede, Microsoft is the shining example of that.

[9:30] * Azathoth and Nyarlathotep unite!

[9:30] <Azathoth> advertisers toss money at google >_>
[9:30] <Yourself> what are we talking about?
[9:30] <Nyarlathotep> And thats doing something right

[9:30] <Nyarlathotep> even if you think i'ts just marketing
[9:30] <FoxtrotZero> Bush was HONESTLY just stupid. That was the only fault. He was stupid as fuck.
[9:31] <vede> Nyarlathotep, that's doing something right, sure, but not in the areas that the users actually care about.
[9:31] <Nyarlathotep> Ok, I care about getting good search results
[9:31] <Azathoth> so you're saying google isn't superior to the other search engines?
[9:31] <Nyarlathotep> I've yet to find anything better than google
[9:31] <Azathoth> like yahoo, msn, etc
[9:31] <vede> Azathoth, hell no, I love it.
[9:32] <Azathoth> so then you're really just arguing semantics?
[9:32] <vede> I was just noting that saying that they must be better because they're the most popular isn't a good way to defend anything.
[9:32] <FoxtrotZero> Yahoo and MSN are pretty much shit. I'll give google their search engine, but thats honestly it, and i'm apalled that they would attempt creating a browser, nevermind an OS
[9:32] <Azathoth> if he had said "advanced" or "awesome" instead of "successful" it would have been a valid argument?

[9:35] <vede> I mean, if you want to do the whole "Oh so one word could be change and that's all it needed?" bit then I may as well just start replacing random words in random sentences and assuming they're identical in meaning.
[9:35] <vurtual> which changes the argument
[9:35] <Azathoth> *sigh*
[9:35] <vurtual> oh hey
[9:35] <vede> "Which licks the argument."
[9:36] <Yourself> this thread is dildos
[9:36] <Adura> vede is going on still?
[9:36] <vurtual> "it" is a pronoun a bit like "he". OR
[9:36] <Azathoth> it just wasn't necessary to derail the whole discussion over some silly little word choice
[9:36] <vurtual> "it" is a pronoun a bit like "she".
[9:36] <vurtual> A word changed, argument the same.
[9:36] <vede> Azathoth, I didn't derail. Someone made a bad argument, I called them out on it. That's just how it works.
[9:36] <FoxtrotZero> If you don't shut up, i think i'm going to die inside
[9:36] <Azathoth> oh great. let's keep talking

[10:14] <vurtual> Firetempest, that is a cool idea.
[10:14] <Malikat> i prefer to think of it as coagulation
[10:15] <Firetempest> i like the original. better memories
[10:15] <vurtual> So, now how am I going to count scores in this map?
[10:15] <Malikat> i liked halo 2 better than halo or halo 3
[10:15] <vurtual> I don't have any halo.
[10:15] <vurtual> :(
[10:15] <vurtual> just half a life.
[10:15] <Firetempest> and i liked the original and 3 more then 2 heh

[10:16] <Firetempest> although i did like the dual needles in 2, ill give it that
[10:16] <Malikat> dual needles were nice
[10:16] <vurtual> Some dark forces must be conspiring against me
[10:16] <vurtual> (to steal my land I guess)
[10:16] <Malikat> i liked ninjanaut
[10:16] <vurtual> And they've left me for dead.
[10:17] <Malikat> and it felt like weapon combos were better in halo 2
[10:17] <Firetempest> still don't like the teleport jumps with sword
[10:17] <vurtual> Now I'm stuck at my own battlefront, fighting off every strike and counter-strike.
[10:17] <Malikat> the what?

[11:02] <darkedone02> most people actually aiming to colonize Mars
[11:02] <Yourself> the surface of venus is a long way off
[11:02] <Yourself> but it turns out colonizing the atmosphere of venus would be considerably easier
[11:02] <Yourself> and there's less of an issue about gravity since venus is much closer in size to earth than mars is
[11:02] <Malikat> rofl
[11:03] <Yourself> the useful part of venus is that it's atmosphere is so damn dense
[11:03] <Malikat> unless the moon has a lot more water than is thought, the moon is not a likely place to colonize
[11:03] <vurtual> moon has LOTS of water.
[11:03] <vurtual> ice caps.
[11:03] <vurtual> apparently.
[11:03] <Yourself> at the surface, the pressure is some 92 atmospheres
[11:03] <Malikat> uh
[11:03] <Yourself> it's ridiculous
[11:03] <vurtual> not like lots lots
[11:03] <vurtual> but it's more than nothing

[11:03] <darkedone02> probably in the far future, not the near future but the far future, we research alot about terraformation to be able to turn most of our non-gas planets into earth like planets, and other planets that we have yet to explore in space.

[11:03] <Yourself> but at 50 km up, you've got about 1 atm and temperatures close to what they are on earth
[11:04] <Yourself> and the atmosphere is denser than human breathable atmosphere
[11:04] <Yourself> so technically you could making a floating colony
[11:04] <vurtual> not really
[11:04] <vurtual> It's far too gradual
[11:04] <darkedone02> like the jetson's
[11:04] <vurtual> and you'd bob around way too much
[11:04] <vurtual> Using the atmosphere, at least.
[11:04] <vurtual> The jetsons has cities on massive stilts
[11:04] <Yourself> except for being able to go outside
[11:04] <vurtual> There's times when the ground itself is featured.
[11:05] <vurtual> Also, I'm a bit skeptical of floating cities

[11:05] <vurtual> Slip, fall, or even get pushed, or have the gronud shift a bit?
[11:05] <vurtual> FALL FOR HOURS AND DIE
[11:05] <Yourself> the other nice thing is that since the pressure at that altitude matches the pressure inside the habitat, damage to the skin won't be catastrophic
[11:05] <vurtual> not exactly the most calming terrain

[11:05] <Yourself> and you'd have enough time to repair it
[11:05] <vurtual> Except the part that breathing the atmosphere would kill you.
[11:06] <vurtual> Very kill you
[11:06] <Yourself> in terms of industrial applications venus is far more useful than mars or the moon
[11:06] <vurtual> A leak would be safer in a no-air environment
[11:06] <vurtual> The only reason we don't just BUILD OUR OWN PLANET is because we're used to having very natural looking planets.
[11:06] <vurtual> and it'd be a bit expensive
[11:06] <Yourself> also at that altitude there are some pretty constant high winds, which circle the planet about once every 4 days
[11:06] <Yourself> so that'd solve the problem of the venusian day being longer than its year
[11:07] <vurtual> What about the poisonous atmosphere and extreme heat?
[11:07] <vurtual> It's not like it's a planet sorta-dusty air
[11:07] <darkedone02> Actually, I think after we have succussfully made cities in mars, we work on our first space station that can be used for trade.... and might make our first space gate to our first new galaxy exploration... like alpha centauri
[11:08] <Yourself> not until we actually find something in the star system
[11:09] <Yourself> we've yet to find a planet in the system
[11:09] <vurtual> Space gates are a pretty lame idea.
[11:09] <vurtual> They'd go out of tech before they're done.
[11:09] <Malikat> a planet with UNOBTAINIUM
[11:10] <vurtual> That's how most things are on earth already.
[11:10] <Yourself> and even if we did, it would take a remarkable amount of time to get there
[11:10] <vurtual> Not with ftl travel.
[11:10] <vurtual> or l travel
[11:10] <vurtual> or ftl because we already sorta figured that out

[15:17] <Iguana> I'm sure some people will have an attack and defend server.
[15:17] <Trapiki> I couldnt code my way out of a cardboard box

[16:39] <Theodore> multiplayer that is
[16:39] <Luingar> likely multiple spawns
[16:40] <Rupertofly> I donno
[16:40] <Luingar> 'cause he said that you'd be able to insert indev and infdev maps into the game
[16:40] <Theodore> becaus inf. is fairly big
[16:40] <Luingar> so what i think is it'll slap yer map into an unloaded section
[16:40] <Luingar> and that will be taht
[16:40] <Rupertofly> I think that ppl can place spawn blocks
[16:40] <Theodore> hmm sounds big an empty

[16:41] <Luingar> no, 'cause shit would expire or sommat
[16:41] <Theodore> how?

[16:44] <Luingar> so the chances are high

[16:44] <Lmaoboats> So I found out that messing with the Religion spheres in Dwarf Fortress makes it so temples are built out of random materials instead of the local stone
[16:44] <Theodore> nice idea
[16:45] <Lmaoboats> Including a 7 story temple of solid platinum
[16:45] <Luingar> blow it up and rob it

[17:03] <Darkfire002> He is 11 hours behind me
[17:03] <vurtual> Simple shapes, random misc model bits, the ability to snap them to the skeletons of various models, and then set special animations for generic things like "casting"
[17:04] <Darkfire002> good idea
[17:04] <gear> what are you talking about
[17:04] <vurtual> Or the ability to use your favorite weapon, and add a simple step-by-step, melded together animations just for it.
[17:04] <Darkfire002> mabye minecraft could do it

[20:36] <firetempest> public school transport, bigger ew
[20:37] <rbos> I like living in a city where the bus and train system aren't the exclusive domain of society's detritus. :P
[20:37] <firetempest> im my day we walked to school, naked, in the winter, uphill, both ways.
[20:38] <firetempest> chased by mountain lions too
[20:40] <XenoXilus> I take it the list on the right, only the names in bold are actually capable of chatting, yes
[20:40] <XenoXilus> Or at least active.
[20:40] <XenoXilus> lol
[20:40] <XenoXilus> wah, my broadband just freaked out
[20:40] <XenoXilus> Well, might discon every now and again, but my laptop seems to hover at 6%
[20:40] <XenoXilus> err, what
[20:40] <XenoXilus> hehe
[20:40] <XenoXilus> I'm half expecting my laptop to conk out soon
[20:40] <XenoXilus> SO here's a goodbye while I still have the chance. =P
[20:40] <XenoXilus> but then again, I'm almost at my stop. so, once I get back mebbe I can pop back and chat with you guys
[20:40] <XenoXilus> I wanna try infdev too, so is it basically exactly like indev, but with more land?
[20:41] <rbos> basically. No caves.
[20:41] <XenoXilus> caves?
[20:41] <rbos> more pigs. :P
[20:41] <firetempest> no cave generation in inf yet
[20:41] <XenoXilus> so, you have to dig caves out yourself?
[20:42] <firetempest> yeah, so finind ore is a bigger pain
[20:42] <XenoXilus> hmm. Is there a material that's creeper proof? might use it as doors
[20:42] <rbos> furnaces are pretty strong
[20:43] <rbos> bit tricky to build with
[20:43] <Codlike> Water is the strongest
[20:43] <rbos> oh good call
[20:43] <firetempest> reforged rock
[20:43] <Codlike> Having creepers blow up in water stops them from destroying blocks
[20:43] <XenoXilus> how do you go about building a house out of furnaces? XD
[20:43] <Codlike> Depends
[20:44] <Codlike> 1) If you want them all facing a certain way
[20:44] <Codlike> 2) Lots of Stone
[20:44] <Codlike> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOTS of stone
[20:44] <XenoXilus> do creepers have to be completely submerged to have that effect, or just standing one tile deep, so halfway up?
[20:44] * TkTech (TkTech@b07s48le.corenetworks.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:44] <Codlike> Not sure
[20:44] <firetempest> water wont move in inf right now also
[20:44] <Codlike> never experienced many creepers exploding in water
[20:44] <XenoXilus> hmm
[20:45] <XenoXilus> Just came up with the best idea over...
[20:45] <XenoXilus> brb, at stop
[20:45] <rbos> creepers will explode in water, but if they do they won't destroy blocks
[20:45] <rbos> they STILL hurt you
[20:46] <firetempest> i hear if you put sand on the lava layer in inf it turns it to lava, so make a lava tube to your base then a lava moat. just kill the buggers before they hiss
[20:46] * Kapow (kapox@c-24-0-74-91.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[20:47] <Codlike> yeah
[20:47] <Codlike> since lava doesn't move
[20:47] <Codlike> you can even place sand on a wall, so it
[20:47] <Codlike> 'falls' into the lava
[20:47] * Kapow (kapox@c-24-0-74-91.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:47] <Codlike> and where you put the sand, the be, it will
[20:48] <Codlike> the lava be*
[20:48] * arxx is now known as arxx-Probably
[20:48] <firetempest> so just equip about 4 picks. dig tell you die in lava, then fill with sand
[20:48] <Codlike> kinda
[20:48] * arxx-Probably is now known as arxx-Sleeping
[20:48] <Codlike> you should put dirt above the lava
[20:48] <Codlike> then pile sand on that
[20:48] <Codlike> then break the dirt
[20:49] <Codlike> the place sand where the dirt was
[20:49] <Codlike> then you have a full pillar of lava
[20:50] <firetempest> so placing sand one at a time above wont propagate the lava?

[20:51] <Drewseph> dude
[20:51] <Drewseph> I just had the best hunting night ever

[20:51] <Drewseph> 50 gunpoweder
[20:51] <Codlike> http://tweetphoto.com/20215306
[20:51] <Codlike> there's an exaple
[20:51] <Codlike> and then there's my room: http://yfrog.com/j3a6fgrj
[20:52] <Codlike> (Any chance I fall into the lava near one of those patches, I can climb out)
[20:52] <Drewseph> at one point 5 creepers spawned surrounding me. I managed to not explode a single one. on top of that right while I was hunting those 5 a group of about 5 skelly's started shooting at me, as I trifed around them another group of 5 or more spawned behind me!
[20:52] <firetempest> yeah i keep a single block above my open lava in the deep mine also
[20:53] <Drewseph> by the time the battle was over, and somehow I didn't get killed, the ground was filled with arrows from the skelly
[20:53] <firetempest> easier then torches
[20:53] <Codlike> yeah, use sand to raise the lava, and then it looks alot better
[20:53] <Codlike> of course, you could just put glass over it
[20:54] <Codlike> but it lights slightly brighter if you raise it
[20:54] <firetempest> true. i hope the sand to lava thing sticks around even after flowing is reimplemented
[20:54] <Codlike> by like, one block more light
[20:55] <Codlike> Probably not
[20:55] <Codlike> but there'll be something to make it happen anyway
[20:55] <Codlike> I'm hoping people can build down into the lava
[20:55] <Codlike> and then not have the room reset to lava when they save+load
[20:56] <Codlike> or
[20:56] <Codlike> exit and load
[20:56] <Drewseph> that lava glitch makes no sense
[20:56] <Codlike> anyway
[20:56] <Drewseph> I hope it gets fixed soon
[20:56] <Codlike> fixed? aw
[20:56] <Drewseph> its a bug
[20:56] <firetempest> well if you reforged your rock back into stone, the lava wont eat it would it?
[20:56] <Codlike> it is, but it's a helpful
[20:56] <Drewseph> it clearly has no logic
[20:56] <Codlike> there is logic

[20:57] <Codlike> it's trying to do a simple 'switch'
[20:57] <Drewseph> i know
[20:57] <Drewseph> but from a programmer perspective its sloppy code
[20:57] <Codlike> since the lava doesn't flow once it's switched, it floats
[20:57] <Drewseph> the sand should fall into the lava
[20:57] <Codlike> it's not sloppy code
[20:57] <Drewseph> not bring the lava to the sand

[20:59] <Codlike> it's not beta
[20:59] <Codlike> it wont be for a long time
[20:59] <Drewseph> you don't seem to understand how game development works
[20:59] <Drewseph> alpha is getting the game running
[20:59] <Drewseph> beta is fixing bugs
[20:59] <Codlike> I understand how MINECRAFT is working
[20:59] <Drewseph> gold is shipping the game
[20:59] <XenoXilus> Hai gaiz, I'm back =D
[21:00] <Drewseph> but my point is
[21:00] <Drewseph> he's in alpha now
[21:00] <Drewseph> which is where sloopy code gets made, beta is the optimization and bug fixing pass
[21:00] <Drewseph> we're not there yet, as you said and I agree
[21:00] <XenoXilus> sloppy? If this is alpha, I'd love it when it finally reaches Gold
[21:01] <Drewseph> ^ this
[21:01] <XenoXilus> mmm.
[21:01] <XenoXilus> I think that eventually, Notch should make one big server and host a giant MP survival
[21:02] <XenoXilus> and charge like, 5 euros a month for access
[21:02] * PyroPyro (PyroPyro@109.93.215.234) has joined #minecraft
[21:02] <Codlike> Doubt it'd happen due to hardware-software limits

[21:02] <XenoXilus> oh well
[21:02] <Codlike> PPM? No thanks Xeno
[21:02] <XenoXilus> aww poot.
[21:02] * Hell_Fire (hellfire@123-243-155-184.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft

[21:02] * PyroPyro (PyroPyro@109.93.215.234) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[21:02] <rbos> That said, charging for access to a giant MP survival could be fun.
[21:02] <XenoXilus> oh wait nvm
[21:02] <XenoXilus> pay per month.
[21:02] <Codlike> Pay-Per_Month
[21:02] <rbos> hmm
[21:02] <Quatroking> XenoXilus, I doubt it, Notch doesn't want to deal with hosting and such
[21:03] <Quatroking> thats why the forums aren't under his direct control
[21:03] <rbos> I on the other hand have computer hardware and a billing system all ready to go
[21:03] <Quatroking> why would we need a billing system?
[21:04] <XenoXilus> access for a giant MP survival server
[21:04] <rbos> because computers aren't free and anything more than 20 or so simultaneous users would require nontrivial upkeep

[21:04] <MarkofBear> yeah i have thought about that too
[21:04] <Quatroking> you want players to pay to play on a multiplayer server?
[21:04] <Quatroking> pfft, good luck with that

[21:04] <rbos> I think it could be done, if the price is kept reasonable and you can market it right.
[21:05] <XenoXilus> otherwise, you have access to whatever you have now
[21:05] * causticLagomorph_ is now known as causticLagomorph
[21:05] <Quatroking> Also I doubt Notch would allow people to make money off minecraft
[21:06] <XenoXilus> no, I mean Notch hosts his own server
[21:06] <XenoXilus> As in, his own giant server that he charges 5 euros a month for access
[21:06] <rbos> I don't see why he wouldn't, if I hosted a pay server, that would motivate people to purchase the client software from N.
[21:06] <XenoXilus> mmm.
[21:07] <rbos> and hell, you could cut him in for 5% or something
[21:07] <Quatroking> xenoxilus, major flaw in there
[21:07] <XenoXilus> hum?
[21:07] <Quatroking> Notch said he wouldn't charge players more than they already paid
[21:07] <Quatroking> also, Notch doesn't like to deal with hosting
[21:07] <Quatroking> again, the forums
[21:07] <XenoXilus> hmm...
[21:07] <XenoXilus> like I said, it's a nice idea

[21:09] <XenoXilus> I found out about Minecraft from guys chatting on Wurm.
[21:10] <XenoXilus> I was excited when I found out it was made by Notch, so I scurried over and insta-purchased.

[22:41] <bildramer> I mean that the CPU shouldn't be overheating at all

[22:41] <Speljohan_> bildramer, what cpu
[22:41] <Dragonshadow> What cpu
[22:41] <Dragonshadow> What heatsink
[22:41] <Speljohan_> cus
[22:41] <bildramer> -___-
[22:41] <Speljohan_> old amd cpu's tend to overhead
[22:41] <Speljohan_> very easily
[22:41] <KodaichiZero> get better fan
[22:41] <Speljohan_> overheat*

[22:42] <KodaichiZero> the temp of my PC has gone down a lot

[22:42] <KodaichiZero> darn bro.
[22:42] <TestDummy> I'm sorry.
[22:42] <bildramer> :l
[22:42] <KodaichiZero> i just love it
[22:42] <bildramer> well
[22:42] <Speljohan_> i very much preferred vista on this pc
[22:42] <Speljohan_> ran way better
[22:42] <Marach-13> Speljohan_: LOL
[22:42] <bildramer> if it's factory default to overheat

[22:43] <KodaichiZero> but 7 seemed only to make it better
[22:43] <TestDummy> I don't understand why Vista would run better on a given machine than 7.
[22:43] <Dragonshadow> ^
[22:43] <Speljohan_> i didnt notice any performance difference between vista and win7 tho KodaichiZero

[22:43] <Dragonshadow> 7 always runs better unless urdoinitrong
[22:43] <TestDummy> In all honesty.
[22:43] <TestDummy> The cut out the fat.
[22:43] <Speljohan_> TestDummy, because the win7 drivers are shite
[22:43] <KodaichiZero> lol
[22:43] <Speljohan_> sound card drivers are bullshit
[22:43] <KodaichiZero> guess so.
[22:43] <Speljohan_> gfx drivers fuck up a lot
[22:43] <pontusedberg> #pontusedberg
[22:44] <TestDummy> Is that Microsoft's fault?
[22:44] <Speljohan_> no
[22:44] <bildramer> I wonder if I can edit the temperature thingy at all
[22:44] <TestDummy> They don't make the hardware.
[22:44] <Speljohan_> i never said that
[22:44] <Speljohan_> at all
[22:44] <ClassiestMedic> Pontus?!?!
[22:44] <Dragonshadow> spel drivers are just fine (now anyway)
[22:44] <ClassiestMedic> No fucking way!
[22:44] <TestDummy> Also, Vista drivers should work in a pinch.
[22:44] <ClassiestMedic> It's me!
[22:44] <ClassiestMedic> Silver shadow!
[22:44] <pontusedberg> ClassiestMedic! =O
[22:44] <Speljohan_> apparently they do not TestDummy
[22:44] <Speljohan_> lol
[22:44] <TestDummy> But if it's 64-bit, you need the signed 64-bit drivers.

[22:44] <Speljohan_> with a graphics card related problem
[22:44] <Speljohan_> never happened in vista
[22:44] <Speljohan_> lel
[22:44] <bildramer> wat
[22:44] <bildramer> there are signed and unsigned drivers?
[22:44] <TestDummy> Then go back to it, silly.
[22:44] <TestDummy> Yes.
[22:45] <bildramer> lol
[22:45] <TestDummy> 32-bit can use either.
[22:45] <LG_Legacy> Hm..
[22:45] <TestDummy> 64-bit is intolerant.
[22:45] <bildramer> also I wonder if my temperature will go to -128 if it gets so hot
[22:45] <Dragonshadow> 64bit is better anyway

[22:46] <Speljohan_> anyways, i couldn't use a 32-bit version of windows
[22:46] <Speljohan_> ever
[22:46] <KodaichiZero> the current topic takes so much fun out of everything
[22:46] <TestDummy> So um, have we established what kind of video card you have?
[22:46] <bildramer> lol
[22:46] <bildramer> why not?
[22:46] <Speljohan_> would be a complete waste of my ram
[22:46] <Speljohan_> would render 4gb useless
[22:46] <KodaichiZero> I remember when we used to RP about /multidev
[22:46] <KodaichiZero> it was funny
[22:46] <bildramer> 64-bit is 2 times more than 32-bit so it's 2 times better nub
[22:46] <TestDummy> PAE LOL
[22:46] <bildramer> -_-
[22:47] <bildramer> well, 64-bit sucks
[22:47] <Speljohan_> nah
[22:47] <Dragonshadow> PAE has overhead
[22:47] <bildramer> I always assume an "int" to be 32 bits
[22:47] <Dragonshadow> and isn't worth it
[22:47] <Speljohan_> i've had no trouble with 64-bit
[22:47] <bildramer> it sucks
[22:47] <Speljohan_> noob
[22:47] <KodaichiZero> 64-bit just has a different instruction set right?
[22:47] <Speljohan_> just cos ur a bad programmer
[22:47] <Speljohan_> noob
[22:47] <bildramer> lol
[22:47] <KodaichiZero> and a larger memory word size?
[22:47] <Speljohan_> ye KodaichiZero
[22:47] <TestDummy> Speljohan_: So um, what sort of video card was it that's giving you trouble?]
[22:47] <bildramer> a bad programmer who won't care about size_of
[22:47] <Yourself> <bildramer> 64-bit is 2 times more than 32-bit so it's 2 times better nub
[22:47] <bildramer> sizeof()*

[22:48] <bildramer> Yourself: was a joke
[22:48] <bildramer> duh
[22:48] <TestDummy> lol nvidia
[22:48] <Speljohan_> running latest drivers
[22:48] <Speljohan_> nobody else has reported problems
[22:48] <KodaichiZero> it's potentially better
[22:48] <bildramer> I should update my drivers
[22:48] * MisterX (MisterX@p5DDE77A9.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft

[22:48] <bildramer> ...
[22:48] <Speljohan_> nah TestDummy
[22:48] <Speljohan_> it's fine cus
[22:48] <Speljohan_> everything works just fine
[22:48] <KodaichiZero> it only is in certain situations
[22:48] <Speljohan_> but it restarts twice a day
[22:48] <bildramer> no
[22:48] <Speljohan_> well
[22:48] <Speljohan_> often twice a day
[22:49] <bildramer> it never is >=2 times better
[22:49] <Speljohan_> when i do gpu-heavy stuff
[22:49] <KodaichiZero> guys
[22:49] <Speljohan_> but temperature never exceeds 50c
[22:49] <bildramer> guy
[22:49] <KodaichiZero> do you know any TF2 servers that allow mic spam?
[22:49] <Speljohan_> so it's not a heating problem
[22:49] <bildramer> lol
[22:49] <Speljohan_> clearly a driver problem
[22:49] <TestDummy> Speljohan_: You mean cooling.
[22:49] <bildramer> Speljohan_: check your memory
[22:49] <TestDummy> Not heating. :)

[22:50] <Speljohan_> i have done debugging before
[22:50] <Speljohan_> on the gpu
[22:50] <Speljohan_> lol
[22:50] <bildramer> alright then
[22:50] <bildramer> :/

[22:50] <Speljohan_> haha
[22:50] <bildramer> lol
[22:50] <bildramer> how?
[22:50] <TestDummy> I'd put the computer to sleep at night, and it'd turn itself on in the middle of the night.
[22:50] <Yourself> <bildramer> Yourself: was a joke
[22:50] <Commandhat> KodaichiZero: I want to know of a popular Gmod server that allows mic spam.
[22:50] <Commandhat> D:
[22:50] <bildramer> lololol
[22:50] <Yourself> i know
[22:50] <KodaichiZero> yeah
[22:50] <Speljohan_> yeah i had that problem on my old rig
[22:50] <Yourself> i got distracted by the meeting i was in so i didn't get a chance to reply
[22:50] <Speljohan_> but that was because
[22:50] <bildramer> Turn on by itself?
[22:50] <bildramer> wat
[22:51] <TestDummy> As it turns out, there's a setting buried deep in the power options or whatever to carry out scheduled tasks at like, 3:00am
[22:51] <Speljohan_> i had 2x ati hd 4850
[22:51] <Speljohan_> and they got massively overheated
[22:51] <TestDummy> Even if it means turning it back on to do so.
[22:51] <bildramer> I need some cooling here
[22:51] <Speljohan_> cus it was the release-models

[23:00] <Speljohan_> and should also be eliminated
[23:00] <Commandhat> Are you saying Minecraft graphics suck?!
[23:00] <bildramer> I don't use goto
[23:00] <Marach-13> Speljohan_ is right
[23:00] <Speljohan_> like i said, it's a faggot habit bildramer
[23:00] <bildramer> but others do and it's fucking trolling

[23:04] <bildramer> it's just an unconditional jump
[23:04] <Mithril> <Slash-Caps> No programs should EVER use goto. - Goto makes code horrible unreadable

[23:14] <Speljohan_> might as well just write a bytecode engineering tool that can automate the process on each new release of desired java application

[23:16] * laCour is now known as Jesus
[23:17] <ichiman> movement schould be on serverside

[23:17] <Marach-13> ichiman: it can be only verified serverside.
[23:17] <Speljohan_> movement is usually not server-side
[23:17] <Marach-13> always*
[23:17] <Speljohan_> not in mmo's
[23:17] <Speljohan_> would use too much bandwidth
[23:17] <Speljohan_> lol
[23:18] <Speljohan_> well, with a few exceptions
[23:18] <Speljohan_> like runescape
[23:18] <Speljohan_> since it is just click move
[23:18] <Marach-13> hm. commenting THAT out should disable hacks

[23:19] <Marach-13> i mean not being able to move at all
[23:19] <Drewseph> he's usually on when he works on minecraft
[23:19] <firetempest> gta vc for only 3$ heh.
[23:20] <Marach-13> so i can reimplement it for clear custom movement
[23:20] <ichiman> player send 1 packet -> server chek "it is valid movement?" -> anything
