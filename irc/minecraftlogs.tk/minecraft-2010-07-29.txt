[0:24] <Flot> God, I hate Brocraft. Vinecraft was much better from what I saw. Smaller community, more friendly admins, less people from /v/.
[0:25] <RaidSoft> anyway, most of the time buying a retail box is quite a bit cheaper then buying a game on steam for me (unless it's on a deal)

[0:25] <sonime> and brocraft uses chatango
[0:25] <polan> for me it's usually better to buy via steam, local stores are crappy and price are mostly similar..

[0:26] <Flot> "anyway, most of the time buying a retail box is quite a bit cheaper then buying a game on steam for me (unless it's on a deal)"
[0:26] <Flot> AHAHAHAHAHA
[0:26] <polan> and in most cases you will loose game
[0:26] <Flot> That is the biggest lie I've seen in a long time.
[0:27] <Flot> Retail on average costs ten dollars more, and stays at that price for twice as long.
[0:27] <Kawa> Flot: uh it's sometimes true actually
[0:27] <polan> sometimes.
[0:27] <RaidSoft> not compared to steam Flot
[0:27] <Snake_Logan> ^^
[0:27] <Snake_Logan> Depends on the game
[0:27] <RaidSoft> let me do a comparison

[0:34] <RaidSoft> now let me also add, the prices of online stores are highly competitive because they compete with everyone in the country for the cheapest price, retail local stores are different
[0:34] <RaidSoft> those are quite a bit higher because they don't have the same competition

[0:42] <RavenBurga> Df maps aren't that big IMO
[0:42] <polan> + you can import part :)
[0:43] <RavenBurga> Compared to mc
[0:43] <Risugami> btw, we're missing most of the DF blocks too heh

[1:23] <Budda> In the last 24 hours, 3497 people registered, and 831 people bought the game.
[1:23] <True|Away> I'm going to ask esper.net to install the M-kick command
[1:23] <Budda> heh
[1:23] <CyborgDragon> i think esper would crash before we reach 4 digits
[1:23] <True|Away> So I can try it out once with over 1000 people.
[1:23] <Budda> mkick?
[1:23] <True|Away> and watch as chanserv struggles to kick everyone from the room as fast as possible
[1:23] <True|Away> M-kick = kick everyone from channel
[1:23] <CyborgDragon> mass kick
[1:24] <DoctorMonch> Just wondering, has Notch made any response toward the whole TF2 blog update? I just got up.
[1:24] <True|Away> yeah
[1:24] <True|Away> the responce was lolzy
[1:24] <WolfY> Was a bit happy :P
[1:24] <CyborgDragon> doctor, he nearly pissed himself
[1:24] <Budda> just +b *!*@*
[1:25] <Zerim> how about just add a script for it?
[1:25] <DoctorMonch> Oh wow
[1:25] <DoctorMonch> I just read it
[1:25] <copyboy> True|Away: isn't there a limit of 350 or something?
[1:26] <DatOneGuy> Why the hell would there be?
[1:26] <CyborgDragon> it's official
[1:26] <CyborgDragon> my wheat farm has grown too big
[1:26] <CyborgDragon> i now have a large chest full of seeds

[1:28] <DoctorMonch> I always decide to delete my maps JUST as they're getting good.
[1:28] <Banger> ive never started a fire yet
[1:28] <DoctorMonch> I think that's why I can't wait for multiplayer. When I'm hosting a server, I won't have that option.
[1:28] <WolfY> Haha, since I bought the game, I've played one map, which is on 25mb
[1:29] <DoctorMonch> Wow :o
[1:29] <Glendening> O.o; i think my biggest map so far is 3.6meg O.o;;;;;;;;
[1:29] <Banger> i only started recently and im up to like 5mb
[1:29] <WolfY> Haha
[1:29] <WolfY> boat helped with that
[1:29] <Glendening> rather hard to find iron, though i did find my first redstone and diamond deep under my little home.
[1:29] <WolfY> just hop in the boat, and go in a straight line for a bit :P
[1:29] <Banger> boat helped?
[1:29] <CyborgDragon> my largest is 10mb
[1:29] <Azu|zzz> mine was at 4.5mb until I got lost and went in the wrong direction home

[1:32] <Roadcrosser> TF2?
[1:32] <CyborgDragon> i remember when it wasnt called classic, and there was creative multiplayer, singleplayer, survivaltest, indev, and infdev
[1:32] <CyborgDragon> before the ladders and doors update
[1:32] <Roadcrosser> me too
[1:32] <Banger> already got 9 redstone
[1:32] <DoctorMonch> I was playing before indev :X
[1:32] <Cheeseum> I have this damn cool mine
[1:32] <Banger> still no dimonds...
[1:32] <Roadcrosser> me too
[1:33] <CyborgDragon> i was gifted the game about a week before that the ladder/door update
[1:33] <Mithril> Wut, I look at the logs, notch had an email from bungie yesterday and now from valve?
[1:33] <buttcrabs> I don't understand how people complain about not finding iron
[1:33] <Cheeseum> under this little cave like formation
[1:33] <CyborgDragon> but i had been playing creative for two months prior
[1:33] <buttcrabs> I easily clear a stack or two per cave
[1:33] <DoctorMonch> I was like "OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS LIKE MULTIPLAYER LEGOS"
[1:33] <Banger> i got gifted the game a couple hours ago lol

[1:33] <Cheeseum> in a chest
[1:33] <buttcrabs> Ahkay
[1:33] <CyborgDragon> buttcrabs it depends
[1:34] <CyborgDragon> if my mine is as far down as it can go
[1:34] <buttcrabs> how long do diamonds picks last again?..
[1:34] <DoctorMonch> diamond bucket *trollface*
[1:34] <Molybdenim> 1025 uses
[1:34] <CyborgDragon> diamond pickaxe would be first
[1:34] <buttcrabs> roughly 1000 was it?
[1:34] <Banger> i have issue finding a lot of iron, i mean i find it a bit but i want more
[1:34] <buttcrabs> ah ok
[1:34] <buttcrabs> thought so
[1:34] <CyborgDragon> otherwise it'd be a sword, then armor
[1:34] <buttcrabs> how much is a lot, in your opinion?

[1:34] <DoctorMonch> a large chest full

[1:35] <buttcrabs> when I returned to my castle about half an hour later
[1:35] <buttcrabs> I'd found 2/3 of the floor was caved in

[1:38] <Banger> olleman i dunno i just got gifted the game
[1:38] <WolfY> around 3:56
[1:38] <olleman> hehe
[1:38] <WolfY> seems notch got offers from Valve?
[1:38] <Banger> valve is known for buying up people with interesting game ideas
[1:38] <WolfY> Yeh
[1:38] <WolfY> but also screwing them up
[1:39] <WolfY> and we ALL dont want that
[1:39] <Mithril> What?
[1:39] <Banger> if i recall portal was like that
[1:39] <Mithril> Where does it say notch turned down the offer of valve?
[1:39] <CyborgDragon> banger, good examples are counter strike and alien swarm
[1:39] <CyborgDragon> no, portal wasnt like that
[1:39] <DoctorMonch> Have you seen the original portal?
[1:39] <Banger> and recently i believe they bought up the people who made "tad"
[1:39] <olleman> heh, you think they expect him to make a minecraft version in the source engine? now that would be something
[1:39] <WolfY> Somewhere in that log, maybe I misread
[1:39] <WolfY> around 3:56
[1:39] <Banger> alien swarm was made by people who were part of the mod community at one time i believe
[1:40] <DoctorMonch> Minecraft is too far along to be changed, since it's well known in the public eye
[1:40] <WolfY> Yes, Alien Swarm devs were bought up
[1:40] <Mithril> Wolfy, he just says if someone would offer me that
[1:40] <CyborgDragon> banger, so was counter strike
[1:40] <CyborgDragon> they were mod devs, who joined valve
[1:40] <noq> anyone know what time the interview with notch is going to be?
[1:40] <WolfY> Ohh, my bad, I skim read =/
[1:40] <Banger> but countrer strike wasnt free was it?
[1:40] <DoctorMonch> I'd love for valve to provide notch with the tools he needs to be able to do whatever he wants

[2:23] <Kodaichi> Although the game deserves tons of publicity, it certainly doesn't NEED it.
[2:23] <WolfY> Whys that a bad thing?
[2:23] <Shugo> publicity on a large scale = notch gets more sales = speedier deveopment and higher quality product
[2:23] <WolfY> This game would be so much bigger if more people new about it
[2:23] <Voltron> Because I hate newfags
[2:23] <Kodaichi> The game was cool when it was barely known. Now, everyone on the fucking internet is goign to be playing it
[2:23] <Voltron> They are all 12 year olds
[2:23] <Voltron> and piss me off

[2:24] <WolfY> fuck that
[2:24] <Shugo> minecraft is already full of kids, just join any random server in creative
[2:24] <WolfY> Put minecraft on steam on release i say
[2:24] <Kodaichi> dont much play creative.
[2:24] <Voltron> Just troll them and make them kill themselves
[2:24] <Voltron> easy fix
[2:24] <Shugo> new creative will be much better, because all the kiddies don't have 10 euros to drop

[2:27] <DBN> im 12 and what is this
[2:27] <TheCactusman> The hats was a joke. Haha. Fat chance.
[2:27] <CyborgDragon> i'm also tired of people complaining about features notch puts in
[2:27] <CyborgDragon> shugo, yes, it is a joke, a semi-joke
[2:27] <Glendening> so anyone played haven and hearth?
[2:27] <CyborgDragon> notch has said he might add skinnable hats though
[2:27] <Voltron> I hate jokes/
[2:27] <Voltron> Its true, you can make hats in minecraft
[2:27] <Voltron> if you close your eyes
[2:27] <Voltron> and focus really, really hard.
[2:28] <DBN> "It also somewhat convinced me to add texture streaming from the servers."
[2:28] <DBN> notch is reversing his decision?
[2:28] <CyborgDragon> when did he ever decide otherwise?
[2:28] <CyborgDragon> i personally love the idea of servers having texture packs
[2:28] <DBN> he was very clear on wanting to keep the look of minecraft constant
[2:28] <buttcrabs> How do I go about opening iron doors?
[2:28] <CyborgDragon> or maybe even: certain worlds
[2:28] <Shugo> texture streaming? inb4 porn worlds with porn hats
[2:29] <CyborgDragon> buttcrabs, redstone, switches, pressure plates, buttons
[2:29] <CyborgDragon> any of the above
[2:29] <WolfY> Or clicking?
[2:29] <Shugo> steel doors don't open by hand
[2:29] <buttcrabs> Oh okay, thanks Cyborg
[2:29] <Shugo> that's their point :V

[2:44] <Mattk50> oh, that sucks
[2:44] <CyborgDragon> and minecraft is actually very ram intensive
[2:44] <doomkid> i think i have to make my path down deeper add more water or lower floor?
[2:44] <Mattk50> yeah it is, ram that is
[2:44] <TheCactusman> I have less than 1 gig.
[2:44] <Kodaichi> Notch is gonna have to start working on that tutorial level soon, because although it is really fun, Alpha is not at all noob friendly
[2:44] <Mattk50> how?
[2:44] <Mattk50> how do you run a computer with less than a gig
[2:44] <olleman> Kodaichi, you said it man.
[2:44] <Mattk50> is that even possible?
[2:44] <doomkid> matt old computers have half a gig
[2:44] <Roadcrosser> Info block!
[2:45] <Roadcrosser> Or signs
[2:45] <Roadcrosser> :/
[2:45] <Roadcrosser> Yeah
[2:45] <Kodaichi> torches are one of the most important things to have

[2:46] <doomkid> iron is pretty easy to get
[2:46] <doomkid> i have a few stacks of 64
[2:46] <TheCactusman> Somehow I don't even have half a gig. I have 446MB according to my computer.
[2:46] <doomkid> stone is like so annoying
[2:46] <CyborgDragon> thecactusman, you may have a dead stick
[2:46] <olleman> rock huh... how do I know which one is rock? I prolly need a pick to loot rock hmm
[2:46] <CyborgDragon> i actually have two 512 sticks

[3:44] <DrakeHiggins> It's not even most. )=
[3:44] <Traviskolber> From my experience it is.
[3:44] <Mithril> so we found out whats in the new update already?
[3:44] <Traviskolber> Maybe bad luck on my part.
[3:44] <CyborgDragon> mithril, wut
[3:44] <Traviskolber> Mithril, it isn't Friday yet...
[3:44] <DrakeHiggins> 50% of the face of a group can be defined by the 5% most crazy
[3:44] <RavenBurgler> An update?
[3:44] <Mattk50> maybe you shouldnt steriotype at all?
[3:45] <Mattk50> that works too travis
[3:45] <CyborgDragon> ignore mithril, he's being silly
[3:45] <Mithril> 1.0.13_01
[3:45] <Viral> i'll ask in 4 hours
[3:45] <Mithril> Im not lieing
[3:45] <CyborgDragon> stereotypes are bad, but the sad fact is that they're based in some truth
[3:45] <Traviskolber> I'll stop stereotyping when I started meeting less stereotypes.
[3:45] <DrakeHiggins> It's not bad luck, you just don't notice the ones that don't fit the sterotype becuase they don't contribute to it.
[3:45] * CyborgDragon points at blacks
[3:45] <Mithril> Play Alpha now
[3:45] <Viral> what the friday update is
[3:45] <sorre> the problem is, as with any representation, the loud ones are the only ones that count
[3:45] <Mithril> there really is 1.0.13_01
[3:45] <Viral> tbh notch should work to GMT +9.5 :(
[3:45] <Mattk50> yep sorre
[3:45] <CyborgDragon> mithril, if it says _01 it's a bugfix
[3:45] <bfzzzz> there really is?
[3:45] <Traviskolber> Mithril, it must be bug fixes.
[3:45] <Banger> what is in _01?
[3:45] <Helar> its updating
[3:45] <Mithril> but what is fixed
[3:45] <Mithril> thats what I want to know
[3:45] <CyborgDragon> who knows
[3:45] <Viral> something tiny
[3:45] <Helar> _01 are usually bugfixes
[3:45] <RavenBurgler> Seecret Thursday update
[3:46] <Mattk50> douchebaggery everywhere
[3:46] <RavenBurgler> OoOoooOOoO
[3:46] <Mithril> I know Helar,but as there is no blog post....
[3:46] <Traviskolber> Man, I'm having a blast running around AC2, randomly killing guards.
[3:46] <DrakeHiggins> That's the biggest problem with sterotypes, people ignore those who don't contribute to the sterotype becuase often enough they are not bringing it up and there for are ignored from the contribution.
[3:46] <muddtusk> RavenBurgler, did you get your server working?
[3:46] <olleman> grah can't find any iron ore
[3:46] <Viral> first number = major update, second number is a minor update, and the other two are bugfixes (or something similar to that). generally anyway
[3:46] <Traviskolber> I've gotten stuck in the main storyline, so I've just given up on it for now.
[3:46] <Tjalnar> Depends how you version your application
[3:46] <Traviskolber> Damn trailing missions -.-
[3:46] <Traviskolber> Gotta hate them.
[3:46] <CyborgDragon> as i said, stereotypes are bad, but sadly they are based in truth

[3:58] <DrakeHiggins> Trust me, if I could kick half the channel I would.

[4:24] <RavenBurgler> I am a sperg but idc lol

[4:27] <Flot> Eeeh.
[4:27] <paradoxplus> yeeh
[4:27] <sorre> well, some wiki editors were sperging about redstone's name, because it had no official name
[4:27] <Flot> Aspergite doesn't fit that well.
[4:27] <RavenBurgler> I am already a sperg so it doesn't matter
[4:27] <Flot> Redstone is smooth.
[4:27] <AndrewPH> Spergus Oxide also sounds cool.

[4:29] <TrueWolves|JobSearching> he shouldn't ban, he should kick as a warning first.
[4:29] <CyborgDragon> notch calls it redstone, it is redstone
[4:29] <AndrewPH> Flot, it's because he bans about it
[4:29] <Flot> ... Haha.
[4:29] <CyborgDragon> notch calls them reeds, they are reeds
[4:29] <sorre> well, i'm an autist, i love minecraft
[4:29] <CyborgDragon> the name arguments are done

[4:41] <CyborgDragon> notch, just one question on my part, will you fix the bug where hitting the coast at even 1 degree while at full speed causes the boat to break?
[4:41] <vede> Notch. I suggested something to you yesterday while you were idling, and I'd really like to know what you think of it. I suggested that text on signs should scale to fit the sign, so a sign whose only text is "->" will end up having a BIG "->" on it.

[5:49] <CyborgDragon> mithril, he most likely will do a seecret update
[5:49] <RavenBurgler> I don't know

[5:58] <citricsquid> visiON: not from minecraft
[5:58] <Codlike> If the sales reaches 1000, I say Notch should release the current version of SMP server software
[5:58] <commandhat> Games started in the last 24 hours:
[5:58] <Kokopure> goodness gracious.
[5:58] <commandhat> Minecraft Classic: 100061

[5:59] <Nesral> Notch, it rained A LOT here in Denmark for a few hours ago
[5:59] <Phil> Oh I wan read intervieW!!
[5:59] <visiON> no, I WANT RAIN
[5:59] <Drakkar> I'd like to congratulation you on the TF2 and infinity ward mention bro
[5:59] <Codlike> Even if you release the server software Notch, we couldn't connect to it!
[5:59] <CyborgDragon> so notch, about the two issues and one suggestion i mentioned to you?
[5:59] <Drakkar> -ion
[5:59] <visiON> 99 luft balloons
[5:59] <Drakkar> it's extremely impressive
[6:00] <zeroZshadow> visiON, share some with me !
[6:00] <Notch> yeah, raining money too :-O
[6:00] <RavenBurgler> NOTCH: is it snowing in this photo? http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2010/07/notch-interview-portrait.jpg

[6:00] <visiON> you want balloons?
[6:00] <visiON> o.O
[6:00] <Notch> 925!?
[6:00] <Notch> :-O
[6:00] <Iguana> Notch, tonight, go out to dinner
[6:00] <Iguana> In a very fancy restaurant
[6:00] <SmokestormX> Yes very good publicity
[6:00] <RavenBurgler> With ez
[6:00] <Notch> not tonight! Tomorrow!
[6:00] <Shrub> Notch what's snow feel like?
[6:00] <Kizzycocoa> n0tch, do you sensibly save all your money, or do you blow it all at the pub? X3
[6:00] <Zelik> and 926 people bought the game.
[6:00] <visiON> Shrub: shit
[6:00] <Notch> cold and wet after a while
[6:00] <Shrub> :(
[6:00] <visiON> seriously
[6:00] <visiON> you dont want snow
[6:00] <Notch> i save it all
[6:00] <citricsquid> Notch: I've been logging the sales, I'll make a funky graph soon. Unless you're doing the same yourself... :P
[6:00] <Notch> almost all, that is
[6:00] <RavenBurgler> Omg I want snoow
[6:00] <CyborgDragon> lag spikes near slimes, hitting a shore ever so slightly while going full speed in a boat breaks it, and would we ever get toggleable floodgates/trap doors?
[6:00] <Notch> i've been too lazy to do a graph, haha
[6:00] <visiON> Snow sucks
[6:00] <Kizzycocoa> ah, ok. ^^ must have a small fortune by now :3
[6:00] <RavenBurgler> No it doesn't
[6:01] <Nesral> Graph would be really cool
[6:01] <visiON> Yeah it does
[6:01] <SmokestormX> I'm one of the new people having bought it like 2 days ago when FourZeroTwo mentioned it on his twitter, and I can say in the time just seeing word of mouth explode and the publicity makes me smile
[6:01] <Notch> slimes are getting nerfed, I might fix the boat, maybe, yes floodgates and trap doors
[6:01] <zeroZshadow> what about a location graph :P ?
[6:01] <visiON> -30C , will you be playing outside in the snow?
[6:01] <visiON> No, you wouldnt

[6:02] <RavenBurgler> Nerfed as in?
[6:02] * Merciless never noticed anything wrong with boats
[6:02] <Iguana> Less damage?
[6:02] * visiON doesn't use boats
[6:02] <Nerdy> Like they won't hurt as much I guess.
[6:02] <Iguana> Maybe attack slower
[6:02] <citricsquid> Notch: so, spill the beans, what did brandon want? I jokingly mentioned how valve were going to buy mojang and people on Facepunch got angry and said they'd never play minecraft again if that happened.
[6:02] <vede> Notch, make slimes even more challenging, but make them a lot rarer. Minecraft really lacks heavy-hitter mobs like that. Just has lots of mooks right now.

[6:02] <visiON> ha
[6:02] <Merciless> dragon i had always thought that intentional
[6:02] <RaidSoft> CyborgDragon: I guess you weren't around when boats self-destructed by touching ANYTHING at any speed? :P
[6:03] <zeroZshadow> would be awesome to see howmany people actualy roam and howmany hog one spot
[6:03] <ez> back
[6:03] <Iguana> I want to craft a bicycle
[6:03] <RavenBurgler> I think water creepers would be cool: they suck up water springs and when they die they spit it everywhere

[6:05] <CyborgDragon> slimes are getting nerfed, which apparently includes fixing their lagspike-inducing ai
[6:05] <Drakkar> but i know a lot of people like infinity ward
[6:05] <visiON> Notch should gift everyone here a free minecraft when it hits 1k :)
[6:05] <CyborgDragon> boats may get fixed
[6:05] <visiON> That would be <3
[6:05] <Shrub> Yes!
[6:05] <CyborgDragon> and we will get trap doors and flood gates
[6:05] <commandhat> CyborgDragon, the nerf is probably an ever louder sound
[6:05] <CyborgDragon> toggleable trap doors and flood gates :D
[6:05] <visiON> I wanna play SMP with Shrub :P
[6:05] <Drakkar> 300 people with free minecraft?
[6:05] <Drakkar> I think not
[6:05] <Drakkar> shrub should get it though
[6:05] <Drakkar> shrub is a bro
[6:05] <Drakkar> ;]
[6:06] <ZomBuster> slime nerf is probably reduced spawn rate
[6:06] <visiON> :(
[6:06] <Shrub> I have it...
[6:06] <visiON> I don't
[6:06] <Shrub> vis have mine
[6:06] <Drakkar> wait what
[6:06] <CyborgDragon> not just that, but apparently fixing their lag incducing ai
[6:06] <CyborgDragon> as i said
[6:06] <ZomBuster> my world had 324 slimes stored but I never saw one
[6:06] <visiON> heh
[6:06] * muddtusk has never seen spawn :`(
[6:06] <zeroZshadow> Notch, will the serverside scripting work from the start ?
[6:06] <Iguana> And tomorrow, Minecraft will be sold in a box at your local game provider
[6:06] <Drakkar> wait did you buy it since we last talked
[6:06] <Merciless> how can i check how many are in my map

[6:06] <visiON> OH NO
[6:06] <Drakkar> it was a month or so ago i think
[6:06] <visiON> its dropping
[6:06] <Drakkar> anyway
[6:07] <Zelik> I know..
[6:07] <CyborgDragon> even a single small babby slime causes a little drop in framerate
[6:07] <visiON> Everyone hurry up and buy minecraft
[6:07] <CyborgDragon> during each logic tick
[6:07] <Drakkar> another christmas event would cause the internet to explode
[6:07] <Zelik> Good idea
[6:07] <CyborgDragon> when im around other mobs that doesnt happen
[6:07] <Zelik> Oh god not the internet!
[6:07] <Shrub> Everytime somebody buys minecraft, Notch writes a line of code in SMP
[6:07] <Phil> FUCK U CMYK
[6:07] <Shrub> fuck you phil
[6:07] <Nerdy> O jesus shrub
[6:07] <Shrub> CMYK rocks.
[6:07] <CyborgDragon> and when i get at least 3 slimes, it's a very noticeable drop in framerate during logic ticks
[6:07] <visiON> 926
[6:07] <Drakkar> man
[6:07] <Nesral> RGB FTW
[6:07] <Phil> yes but not in my case
[6:07] <Drakkar> i wish i had starcraft 2
[6:07] <Drakkar> fucksake
[6:07] <Shrub> RGB is cool
[6:07] <visiON> I have SC2 beta
[6:07] <visiON> derp
[6:07] <Shrub> but CMYK is classic
[6:07] <Drakkar> that editor is so fucking arousing
[6:07] <commandhat> Shrub, according to that, half a million people bought minecraft then... lol

[6:24] <Bodie_> fo rizzle

[6:24] <OpalMist> Notch: I wasn't aware it was a book.
[6:24] <Cat> hahah
[6:24] <Horrible> THat brings up the question
[6:25] <Notch> the minecraft alpha counter counts online plays, and when the client updater checks for a new version
[6:25] <Traviskolber> It isn't WILL Minecraft have them.
[6:25] <Horrible> are creepers egg-laying?
[6:25] <Nerdy> Snake. You login to play the game each time. So he gets the info that way.
[6:25] <Genemos> Koramei: indeed
[6:25] <Traviskolber> It is WHEN.
[6:25] <Cat> creeper babies. there is no god.
[6:25] <Notch> so it doesn't count offline play

[6:50] <Phil> I want
[6:50] <commandhat> SMP
[6:51] <Fisheatsbear> cheese puffs?
[6:51] <Kizzycocoa> for miyamoto to like minecraft, it would have to have been redone over five times

[6:51] <lifeless> apprantly Minecraft 3d is really cool lol.. i havent got the stuff for it tho
[6:51] <Mithril> Miyamoto likes low-res stuff though (Its a wii and DS, so low res) so he will like minecraft too

[6:51] <Koramei> Notch, this is just a suggestion but maybe you should put like "FREE" next to the minecraft classic links on the main website. Several of my friends followed the blog post and clicked on the alpha, saw it wasn't free and then left.
[6:51] <kdyg> Minecraft is not based on Miyamoto's experience with Megablocks Dragon set
[6:51] <Nerdy> http://tinyurl.com/gabetv Just think MC on this tv
[6:51] <kdyg> All Miyamoto games must be based off of his experience with something
[6:51] <Phil> Nootch make sure the creeper lushies look good
[6:51] <Merciless> n3x15, inadvertantly yes. homebrew. but i think the 3ds sdk would be plenty easy to use
[6:51] <Mithril> Notch: I agree with Koramei
[6:52] <Phil> not like retarded marshmellos
[6:52] <Zelik> It was on Troldesprjlet
[6:52] <Furyhunter> I love that he's playing WoW in that shot.

[7:03] <Mithril> TF2 blog
[7:03] <CyborgDragon> a developer at infinity ward mentioned it on his twitter
[7:03] <Nerdy> Bungie but we don't know the link
[7:03] <WolfY> Garrys Mod is only top 10 cos tbh, your running out of decent valve games after say the top 5/6
[7:03] <commandhat> Ctrl Alt Del I think
[7:03] <CyborgDragon> bungie didnt mention it, they contacted notch
[7:03] <Mithril> Fourzerotwo mentioned it
[7:03] <commandhat> But I'm definitely not sure
[7:03] <Mithril> Bungie emailed notch
[7:03] <Nerdy> Ahh
[7:03] <Fisheatsbear> for all we know, bungie was an email
[7:03] <CyborgDragon> same for google
[7:03] <Fisheatsbear> ya

[7:03] <Leiche> bungie sucks.

[7:06] <Zelik> 972
[7:06] <CyborgDragon> -.-
[7:06] <Nerdy> For some Wisp it is friday
[7:06] <lifeless> but its thursday...
[7:06] <commandhat> -_-
[7:06] <kdyg> Why does Bungie suck again?
[7:06] <Phil> YOU LIAR
[7:06] <Phil> there is no UPDATE
[7:06] <Merciless> friday as of 6 minutes ago hurr
[7:06] <CyborgDragon> kdyg: for making the age of empire devs fail at halo wars
[7:06] <lifeless> while hes probably working on secret friday 7... its noy friday
[7:06] <Fisheatsbear> http://www.myspace.com/missingno100 <<missingno.
[7:06] <kdyg> That wasn't their fault
[7:06] <lifeless> ok friday for SOME
[7:06] <Sanky> Friday for 16 hours.
[7:06] <lifeless> lol
[7:06] <CyborgDragon> kdyg: they made them fail
[7:06] <kdyg> Microsoft owns Halo, not Bungie
[7:06] <Wisp> Ensemble studios disbanded after halo wars
[7:06] <kdyg> Blame Microsoft instead
[7:07] <kdyg> For forcing a developer to do something they probably didn't want to do
[7:07] <CyborgDragon> kdyg: they all wanted to retire, and bungie made them screw up developing halo wars
[7:07] <Furyhunter> age of empires is DEAD

[7:07] <CyborgDragon> fury, i said DEVELOPERS OF
[7:07] <Rooster> I loved Age of Mythology
[7:07] <kdyg> Age of Empires died because AoE3 was shit
[7:07] <Furyhunter> yeah
[7:07] <Rooster> It was fucking awesome.
[7:07] <CyborgDragon> the last game those devs ever made was halo wars
[7:07] <Furyhunter> aoe2 >>>>>> aoe3
[7:07] <Nerdy> AOE was fun but Rise of Nations is the best
[7:07] <Wisp> AOE2 TC was the best
[7:07] <Nerdy> RON > AOE2 + 3
[7:07] <Quatroking> AoE 2 was the best in the series
[7:07] <CyborgDragon> and it was bad because bungie and microsoft pressured them
[7:07] <Quatroking> I still have all the original CD's :D
[7:08] <Wisp> The third one confused me
[7:08] <kdyg> Everyone is saying Bungie sucks but it seems they only hate them because they are popular
[7:08] <Nerdy> Or because they made halo
[7:08] <Wisp> no resource points? aww
[7:08] <Quatroking> in fact, AoE 1 was the first game I bought for my pc
[7:08] <CyborgDragon> kdyg: generic story+generic fps
[7:08] <kdyg> Every game is generic
[7:08] <Furyhunter> let's streamline the concept of expansions in to "capture a point on the map for free resources"
[7:08] <kdyg> No game has a good plot
[7:08] <Quatroking> half-life
[7:08] <CyborgDragon> that go popular just because it was the launch title for the xbox
[7:08] <kdyg> Half-Life has a shit plot
[7:08] <Fisheatsbear> minecraft has a good plot
[7:08] <Wisp> "Thought I'd shoot my way out. Mix things up a little."
[7:08] <Nerdy> kdyg: No
[7:08] <kdyg> I love Valve, but they don't have good stories
[7:08] <Zelik> Punch those blocks
[7:08] <Quatroking> then again there's obviously stephen king influence in half-life
[7:08] <kdyg> Maybe compared to other video games
[7:08] <commandhat> Furyhunter: King of the resource hill
[7:08] <kdyg> But overall, the stories suck
[7:09] <WolfY> HL stories arnt that bad
[7:09] <Wisp> Fun > Story
[7:09] <WolfY> I mean they're dragging the fucked out
[7:09] <kdyg> For video games yeah
[7:09] <Furyhunter> but you see in starcraft
[7:09] * Shisno is now known as Hy\csts\
[7:09] <CyborgDragon> kdyg: i told you the reason people hated bungie
[7:09] <Leiche> I smell a troll.
[7:09] <Furyhunter> defending your resources is pivotal to your success
[7:09] <Fisheatsbear> lol, shisno
[7:09] <kdyg> Wisp obviously
[7:09] <kdyg> But that's not what we're arguing
[7:09] <Hy\csts\> what, Fisheatsbear.
[7:09] <CyborgDragon> they made three generic fps's with generic stories that were so popular it just made every real gamer rage at all the casuals
[7:09] <Merciless> autist
[7:09] <Furyhunter> in halo wars defending your resources is defending your base
[7:09] <Hy\csts\> CSTS stands for crying self to sleep
[7:09] <Furyhunter> is massive the same type of unit
[7:10] <Furyhunter> massing*
[7:10] <Merciless> sorry i couldnt be more of a help
[7:10] <Sanky> Why every time Minecraft crashes, I lose all map changes but keep my location and blocks ? I hate when I build something, it crashes and I lose what I used to build it
[7:10] <Merciless> i wish you luck though hy
[7:10] <kdyg> CyborgDragon, are you 12 years old or a 4chan poster?
[7:10] <Nerdy> Sanky. Save often
[7:10] <kdyg> Or both?
[7:10] <CyborgDragon> niether, kdyg
[7:10] <Sanky> I guess that's a good idea.
[7:10] <Furyhunter> minecraft only saves the map data when you pause and exit

[7:11] <Furyhunter> that's why I said
[7:11] <CyborgDragon> if you leave the pause menu up long enough
[7:11] <Furyhunter> > when you pause and exit
[7:11] <CyborgDragon> it saves the entire world

[7:23] <Kyto> null char as color code? :D
[7:23] <gear1> and its nbsp
[7:23] <Drakkar> altcode+0160
[7:23] <Kyto> ctrl+o in mirc does that
[7:23] <polan> ,,lol``
[7:23] <copyboy> yeah, that'd be more useful
[7:23] <geraldbrent> XD
[7:23] <Kyto>
[7:23] <CyborgDragon> kyto, ?? isn't fine because not everyone has ?? on their keyboard
[7:23] <Kyto>
[7:23] <CyborgDragon> and alt codes dont work in minecraft
[7:23] <Drakkar> i don't
[7:23] <geraldbrent> test
[7:23] <Kyto> well how about null char? and make ctrl+o print it
[7:23] <Drakkar> that's depressing
[7:23] <Kyto> like in mirc
[7:23] <Drakkar> altcodes are pretty boss
[7:24] <polan> ctrl+o = shortcut to open in most programms
[7:24] <Merciless> bM??????89Uf??lI
[7:24] <Drakkar> the only one i've memorized is 0160 though
[7:24] <Kyto> polan: not in mc
[7:24] <commandhat> That said, Ctrl+c should be "color combo"
[7:24] <commandhat> because derp
[7:24] <geraldbrent> copy
[7:24] <vede> Also, alt-codes are Windows-only, as far as I know.

[7:24] <Zelik> ??
[7:24] <Drakkar> (and you need a numpad)
[7:24] <lifeless> ??
[7:24] <Merciless> ??.??

[7:25] <CyborgDragon> SUCCESS
[7:25] <vede> CyborgDragon, well, he could force all non-Windows users to try to find some obscure software like that, or he can use a symbol available easily on nearly every keyboard in existence.

[7:46] <vede> Notch, I think you should use a video that better represents the full gameplay of Minecraft.
[7:46] <Banger> needs more centering
[7:46] <Notch> yeah, I need a better video
[7:46] <Ted> Cool, Notch is online :)
[7:46] <Notch> I want to use my own, though
[7:46] <gear1> its aight
[7:46] <Banger> video is far to much left
[7:46] <gear1> eventually you should set up a media page
[7:47] <Notch> center it?
[7:47] <Notch> oh yeah, with screenshots
[7:47] <gear1> and maybe a more prominent link to the wiki
[7:47] <commandhat> Notch, I can create a video showing off a few of the features in Alpha up to 1.0.13
[7:47] <vede> Or! Have four or so "Featured Minecraft Videos" in a horizontal line where that video is right now, from various sources, so you can have a little group of videos that represents Minecraft-as-it-is-right-now.

[7:49] <Notch> When I was employed, I earned about 36k SEK before taxes
[7:49] <SireTRM> It's papyrus.
[7:49] <geraldbrent> yay
[7:49] <splitz> heard its bamboo
[7:49] <Kokopure> it should be named Bambyrus, dammit!
[7:49] <Banger> Codlike do you know what that was orginally from?
[7:49] <Quatroking> SireTRM, too bad Notch called it reeds, eh
[7:49] <OpalMist> I suppose at least with such high taxes, you'd get pretty good public services.
[7:49] <Kyto> does anyone know what all the values mean if show fps is enabled?
[7:49] <WolfY> vede, say today has made Notch around 5000 euros
[7:49] <OpalMist> At least, so goes the idea...
[7:49] <SireTRM> E: Is entities, Kyto
[7:49] <sppt> Notch, is it not possible to invest the money to avoid taxes?
[7:49] <Codlike> @Banger, nope
[7:49] <Notch> yeah, we've got almost free healthcare
[7:49] <Mos> neticome from minecraft is higher than the average income of everyone ever
[7:49] <Cintiq> Notch, I'd put the video at the bottom, as opposed to the top.
[7:49] <Prime_Intellect> oh hey notch is on
[7:49] <Notch> I could invest, but it's not like the taxes are making be broke..
[7:50] <sppt> yeah, but losing half the money you made does suck
[7:50] <TheCactusman> 991 D:
[7:50] <SireTRM> Another update. . .
[7:50] <Mos> what would be the point of investing it
[7:50] <Mos> you'd still havet o pay taxes
[7:50] <vede> Notch, to better illustrate what I'm thinking of for the front page, it's like the image-scroller thing on this page (http://www.redeclipse.net/) except with links to videos and displaying thumbnails of the videos.
[7:50] <Skyl3lazer> its freakin bamboo its obvious...
[7:50] <JamesK89> oh god not this debate again
[7:50] <Skyl3lazer> i mean papryus doesnt even look like it
[7:50] <Cintiq> i've not even found any papyrus
[7:50] <Prime_Intellect> O_o
[7:50] <Quatroking> Skyl3lazer, its reeds, Notch confirmed it
[7:50] <ZomBuster> vede or like the new youtube bar
[7:50] <Cintiq> so i won't comment.
[7:50] <Banger> Codlike was from a recent drug bust, they cloned an offical texas something or other and somehow got caught, with a lot of drugs plus the money was confiscated aswell during the bust. that is all the money :D
[7:50] <Skyl3lazer> uh guess what is a reed
[7:51] <Skyl3lazer> bamboo is a reed
[7:51] <SireTRM> Kyto, E: number/number is the entity counter. C: number/number is the rendered block count.
[7:51] <Quatroking> yup :)
[7:51] <gear1> its blockboo
[7:51] <vede> And Notch, you should go the good-guy route and, say, donate it to some organization close to the gaming community.
[7:51] <Ted> I think the whole webpage design need to be improven..
[7:51] <Skyl3lazer> so its bamboo
[7:51] <Kyto> SireTRM: thanks
[7:51] <vede> Skyl3lazer, it's OFFICIALLY called "reeds"
[7:51] <SireTRM> T: All: is the total entity count, also.
[7:51] <JamesK89> Notch almighty said LET THERE BE GENERIC REEDS, and there were generic reeds and he saw that it was good.
[7:51] <Quatroking> it COULD be bamboo
[7:51] <TheCactusman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4ON97-bqrc
[7:51] <Prime_Intellect> JamesK89: lol
[7:51] <Skyl3lazer> bamboo is a reed so if its a reed its bamboo
[7:51] <Merciless> notch, i assume you make that tax back at the end of the finincial year...right?

[7:51] <Notch> make tax back?
[7:51] <vede> Skyl3lazer, that logic so absurdly flawed that I suspect you're just trolling.
[7:51] <Diablodoct0r> Please guys, stop the ass-kissing and say something constructive?
[7:51] <SireTRM> Notch, do you want to tell us what all the status outputs of the "Show FPS" data means?
[7:51] <Diablodoct0r> =/
[7:51] <Skyl3lazer> wtf how is it flawed
[7:51] <Drakkar> psst
[7:52] <Quatroking> Skyl3lazer, western digital makes harddrives so if its a harddrive its made by western digital
[7:52] <Notch> i barely remember myself
[7:52] <Drakkar> you can't make paper out of bamboo
[7:52] <gear1> in minecraft you can
[7:52] <Cintiq> Notch - http://pastebin.org/428087
[7:52] <Drakkar> psst
[7:52] <Quatroking> Drakkar, actually you can
[7:52] <gear1> IN MINECRAFT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
[7:52] <Skyl3lazer> no but if its between papryus and bamboo and its a reed then it has to be bamboo
[7:52] <Drakkar> papyrus are reeds
[7:52] <Skyl3lazer> and no, the chinese made paper out of bamboo years before papryus paper
[7:52] <Drakkar> psst
[7:52] <Cintiq> not sure if it's new / just a rare bug

[7:52] <Diablodoct0r> There are more bugs, Cintiq
[7:52] <Diablodoct0r> :)
[7:52] <Cintiq> yeh
[7:52] <Quatroking> it can be bamboo, and you're free to call it that way, but its easier to refer to it as reeds in minepedia.
[7:52] <Diablodoct0r> Snow for example
[7:52] <Notch> being had to be cut out of space issues
[7:52] <JamesK89> Papyrus paper was something the Egyptians invented I think
[7:52] <Diablodoct0r> Snow adds ontop of Signs
[7:53] <Notch> the glass thing sounds.. weird. :-O
[7:53] <Quatroking> that way, everyone is happy because its BOTH
[7:53] <Diablodoct0r> And, on top of half-blocks, snow lays too high
[7:53] <Quatroking> BAMBYRUS
[7:53] <SireTRM> JamesK89, yes.
[7:53] <Cintiq> one of my fav songs nexto hiphopopotomus v rhymenocerous
[7:53] <Prime_Intellect> there's the floating picture bug
[7:53] <Raws> Cintiq: do you actually have a Cintiq? :O

[7:53] <Prime_Intellect> which i think is awesome
[7:53] <Cintiq> i have no idea how they spell that
[7:53] <Skyl3lazer> why dont u just refer to every rock as "rock" then why say granite or gravel or whatever theyre all just rocks
[7:53] <SireTRM> Quatroking, it's a Bambyrus reed.
[7:53] <Diablodoct0r> And, in water, you can add blocks through yourself from below
[7:53] <Notch> no, no idea :D
[7:53] <Kizzycocoa> <not asking about them>
[7:53] <Kizzycocoa> ah, ok :3
[7:53] <Cintiq> Raws, unfortunately not. I've got a bamboo a4.
[7:53] <JamesK89> I made a huge reed farm and I pretend its a corn field
[7:53] <Kokopure> Quatroking, it's Bambyrus :x
[7:53] <Kizzycocoa> (books)
[7:53] <JamesK89> I expect UFOs any day now

[7:53] <Prime_Intellect> oh god no
[7:53] <Raws> Cintiq: aww, I wanted to be jealous. I'm rockin' my 6x8 intuos
[7:53] <Diablodoct0r> Rare, tiny bats
[7:53] <Kizzycocoa> it called "reeds" :P
[7:53] <Kyto> :D
[7:53] <Skyl3lazer> but they're both rocks! and bamboo is a reed and you call it that!

[7:54] <Zelik> Cmon some1 buy the game!
[7:54] <Kokopure> wait
[7:54] <Outpost> On sales?
[7:54] <Diablodoct0r> Notch: Just use Ajax to make it dynamically update on-page
[7:54] <Kizzycocoa> it was mentioned on a livestream. even if I had got there, I wouldn't have heard it.
[7:54] <SireTRM> *refreshrefresh*
[7:54] <Kokopure> how many are there?
[7:54] <vede> Donating any Minecraft income that's ridiculously above the average income level in your location goes a long way to making it clear that you're not an evil bastard who's only in it for the cash.

[7:54] <Kokopure> fff
[7:54] <Sturmeh> yo

[7:54] <lifeless> complete chat rush there
[7:54] <Prime_Intellect> wow
[7:54] <Kokopure> if it were like down to 998, I'd buy another one
[7:54] <Notch> that's cheating!
[7:54] <Kizzycocoa> it's like if notch comes on here. no-one will really be able to look it up
[7:54] <Outpost> Screw that, keep all the money and put it towards developement!
[7:54] <lifeless> lol
[7:54] <ylt> i feel like making something to graph stats page :p
[7:54] <SireTRM> vede, life savings thing?

[7:54] <Sturmeh> http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/2788/screencap.png whats this about Notch?
[7:54] <Wisp> main page updated when?
[7:54] <GMP> 992
[7:55] <Kokopure> I'd buy two for my friends, if it came down to it.
[7:55] <Sturmeh> D:
[7:55] <GMP> woop
[7:55] <Merciless> ??Let your Minecraft flow.??
[7:55] <zagabar> Notch: How about a gamemode where you build villages for npcs that spawns that you have to protect? More houses = more npcs = more score
[7:55] <GMP> and it went down
[7:55] <Kizzycocoa> painting doors are hard to make now :C gotta do map editing
[7:55] <SireTRM> 991 :/
[7:55] <Notch> they wanted to talk to me, I gave them my number. =)
[7:55] <Kokopure> ff

[7:55] <JamesK89> I wish doors would allow fluid to flow through when open
[7:55] <Prime_Intellect> the tf2 blog helped a lot, id imagine
[7:55] <Prime_Intellect> lol
[7:55] <Notch> nooo, don't tell me it peaked at 993, haha
[7:55] <SireTRM> Notch: He wears has.
[7:55] <Kizzycocoa> wha? did you? O.o
[7:55] <JamesK89> Its kind of derp that they don't
[7:55] <Quatroking> you could've, you know, checked the changelog and asked me
[7:55] <Notch> that's just annoyingly close
[7:55] <Prime_Intellect> JamesK89: i dont
[7:55] <Kizzycocoa> I didn't see :S
[7:55] <SireTRM> Hats*
[7:55] <Sturmeh> Notch: want me to buy it 7 times? :P
[7:55] <Notch> no cheating!
[7:55] <Prime_Intellect> JamesK89: my watervator system operates based on that rule
[7:55] <rcfighter> When it gets to 1000, someone should host a server to celebrate.
[7:55] <Nahob> Do people who bought the game have a number for their registration? Something we can compare like SteamIDs on steam?
[7:55] <Kokopure> is it cheating if we buy it for our friends??
[7:55] <Outpost> Valve might want to take his project like they did with the original idea behind Portal and turn it into something of theirs with his help.

[7:56] <TheCactusman> It's going up and down D:
[7:56] <Kizzycocoa> sorry. I slipped up. I was sorta not myself around then.
[7:56] <Kokopure> I can buy two copies for my friends, if it comes down to that
[7:56] <lifeless> 991 :(
[7:56] <Cintiq> Outpost, I think it needs to be a one man project, honestly.
[7:56] <Wisp> oh noes its like the rollercoaster on the main page 0.0
[7:56] <Prime_Intellect> wait what
[7:56] <Sturmeh> Outpost: i doubt Valve will want to keep it Java though
[7:56] <Cintiq> Keeps it exactly as intended.
[7:56] <Quatroking> Just spend some more time in research, its worth it and necessary in cases like this
[7:56] <Sturmeh> D:
[7:56] <Diablodoct0r> Notch: Careful about Steam, Valve takes more than 50% of the money. It might not be worth it at all.
[7:56] <Cintiq> though i must confess, valve + notch would be nothing short of god tier
[7:56] <Fisheatsbear> omg i refreshed and it said 693
[7:56] <Drakkar> Minecraft: Source
[7:56] <ColdFusion> Getting your game on steam store is something else then getting support from valve
[7:56] <Outpost> Cintiq: Yeah, but they can work with his ideas. The other case is they want hats and TF2 weapons.
[7:56] * Ted (Mibbit@90-231-155-55-no21.tbcn.telia.com) has joined #minecraft
[7:56] <Diablodoct0r> And, they have strict policies afaik
[7:56] <Drakkar> its not more than 50%
[7:56] <GMP> Drakkar: only prob, is that source is mad limited in ent count :p
[7:56] <Kizzycocoa> oh, wait? I didn't see that :S I wouldn't move a whole page. but I did revert the reed naming
[7:57] <Cintiq> Diablodoct0r, disregard the MASSIVE amount of revenue it'd haul in.
[7:57] <Diablodoct0r> Drakkar: garry pays about that sum
[7:57] <Banger> Diablodoct0r yea but the exposer of it aswell
[7:57] <vede> I also doubt Valve will support Notch's intent to open-source the game later.
[7:57] * terribletriojoe (terribletr@interface.vsl.cua.edu) has joined #minecraft
[7:57] <Wisp> Someone should make all the blocks notch and rename the game notchcraft.
[7:57] <Prime_Intellect> yeah
[7:57] <Drakkar> it varies on contract
[7:57] <GMP> Diablodoct0r: its 50% w/ garry
[7:57] <ColdFusion> Steam only takes 50% for Garrysmod not for every game
[7:57] <Skyl3lazer> idc if u named the page reeds its bamboo
[7:57] <Fisheatsbear> D: its 989
[7:57] <lifeless> 989..
[7:57] <lifeless> its going down
[7:57] <Kokopure> D:
[7:57] <Nerdy> Noooo
[7:57] <Diablodoct0r> 50% of 50% of Minecraft
[7:57] <Kizzycocoa> tbh, it was another aspergite. there was bound to be confusion, even for moderators
[7:57] <Drakkar> you have to set up a deal with them to put it on steam
[7:57] <Outpost> And Steam only does that because Garrysmod is basically Valve's work + some coding.
[7:57] <Prime_Intellect> haha
[7:57] <Diablodoct0r> IS what he'll have left
[7:57] <Miclee> Diablodoct0r, it's different with indie games.
[7:57] <ColdFusion> Garrysmod is based on there engine. Without steams help garry woulden't be allowed to sell it. Thats why its about 50%
[7:57] <Banger> chances the extra exposer would be great
[7:57] <Codlike> 989, we're decending
[7:57] <Diablodoct0r> How so, Miclee?
[7:57] <Fisheatsbear> quick, start buying
[7:57] <commandhat> Notch, is there an exact date for SMP server software?
[7:57] <Quatroking> Kizzycocoa, except it wasn't a troll article
[7:57] <Wisp> Aspergite?
[7:57] <Miclee> They try helping them instead of taking them over.
[7:57] <Drakkar> eversion HD pays something like
[7:57] <Drakkar> 20-30%
[7:57] <Cintiq> commandhat, when it's ready
[7:57] <Merciless> wisp redstuff
[7:57] <Banger> indie games im pretty sure the folks get a nice chunk
[7:57] <Wisp> ah
[7:58] <commandhat> Cintiq: that's not exact
[7:58] <Outpost> 20=30% isn't bad either, considering how well it sold.
[7:58] <Kizzycocoa> but, the redstone had several people renaming the article constantly
[7:58] <Cintiq> :)
[7:58] <Kizzycocoa> same as reeds/bamboo
[7:58] <Nerdy> Seems exact enough to me. :D
[7:58] <Banger> and just based on how huge steam is the extra games he is likely to sell
[7:58] <Sturmeh> commandhat: done when it's done?
[7:58] <Cintiq> i still don't understand everesion on steam
[7:58] <Quatroking> True, true
[7:58] <lifeless> In the last 24 hours, 789 people registered, and 178 people bought the game.
[7:58] <Cintiq> it's free officially
[7:58] <lifeless> WTH?
[7:58] <Prime_Intellect> anyone had a chance to get into the smp server yet?
[7:58] <lifeless> must of bugged
[7:58] <Hyst> anyone know how to trick megavideo's video cooldown?
[7:58] <SireTRM> 993 ^.^
[7:58] <Diablodoct0r> well I wrote the final articles on Redstone, Redstone_(dust) and Redstone_(ore)
[7:58] <TheCactusman> 993!!!!!!!!
[7:58] <Fisheatsbear> :D it went up 993
[7:58] <Diablodoct0r> they're fine now
[7:58] <Cintiq> i'd just donate as opposed to buying it from steam
[7:58] <Wisp> I hope secret friday update has cake :D
[7:58] <Zelik> YAESH!
[7:58] <lifeless> 993 now lol
[7:58] <Quatroking> Prime_Intellect, I did when there was actual testing going on
[7:58] <CompuHacker> So Notch is basically rolling in dough right now? :D
[7:58] <Codlike> ooh, 993
[7:58] <Drakkar> Cintiq, it's different
[7:58] <Kizzycocoa> I just thought "ok, we need to just keep it as it is now, and wait for an official confirmation link"
[7:58] <lifeless> 994
[7:58] <JamesK89> ITS OVER NINE HUUUNNDRRREEEDD
[7:58] <GMP> lol
[7:58] <Cintiq> Prime_Intellect, no, as there are 8 connections / sec going to it
[7:58] <Fisheatsbear> this is like watching the stock market
[7:58] <SireTRM> Ninjas ninja'd.
[7:58] <Zelik> Notch, will update has cakes?
[7:58] <rcfighter> 6 more!
[7:58] <Prime_Intellect> Quatroking: i mean since the leak
[7:58] <GMP> we need companion cubes

[7:58] <commandhat> 994!
[7:58] <Outpost> Secret Friday Update needs portals.
[7:58] <Kizzycocoa> livestream meant that never came
[7:58] <Quatroking> Prime_Intellect, of course not
[7:58] <Diablodoct0r> Also Notch, make obsidian immune to explosives in Secret Friday >_>
[7:58] <sppt> Hyst, i wish i did
[7:59] <Diablodoct0r> I'd be happy
[7:59] <Kizzycocoa> and notch, PLEASE clearly name stuff in future please? pleeeeeeeeease?
[7:59] <GMP> craft a compaion cube
[7:59] <Hyst> sppt
[7:59] <Prime_Intellect> Quatroking: how buggy was it for you?
[7:59] <Outpost> Then we can make giant portal hubs.
[7:59] <GMP> out of steel
[7:59] <Cintiq> there is a portal game type
[7:59] <GMP> and pork
[7:59] <SireTRM> Whole pages of chat in under a minute. . .

[7:59] <Hyst> did you try setting your own time forward?
[7:59] <Merciless> Also Notch, make obsidian immune to explosives in Secret Friday >_>
[7:59] <Merciless> this
[7:59] <Diablodoct0r> Or, just a today-Update!
[7:59] <Cintiq> was playing it, was pretty awesome
[7:59] <Banger> looks like ur going to break 1000 sold in a single day Notch :D
[7:59] <Sturmeh> game needs tooltips :P
[7:59] <Hyst> or deleting cookies?
[7:59] <Prime_Intellect> oh god what a flood
[7:59] <Quatroking> occasional sinkholes, things acting weird
[7:59] <Kizzycocoa> cookies. yes
[7:59] <ColdFusion> Notch notch notch. Because saying his name as much as you can. Will make him answere
[7:59] <Fisheatsbear> 6 more O_O
[7:59] <Kizzycocoa> we must have them in MC
[7:59] <Sturmeh> 1000 sold = 10,000 euros, zomg D:
[7:59] <Diablodoct0r> ColdFusion -_-
[7:59] <Prime_Intellect> in one day
[7:59] <Wisp> - paypal
[7:59] <Prime_Intellect> looool
[7:59] <vede> Can't express how strongly I think Notch becoming a "company" in the generic "We're doing all we can to make our customers happy <canned responses> <emotionless announcements> <we really only care about money>" sense would be one of the worst things to happen to the entirety of independed gaming in general.
[7:59] <SireTRM> 99,500*
[7:59] <Drakkar> Sturmeh, you're forgetting tax
[7:59] <Quatroking> Sturmeh, minus tax
[7:59] <Kokopure> Fisheatsbear, what's the count now?
[7:59] <Sturmeh> ah
[7:59] <Fisheatsbear> its 994
[7:59] <Sturmeh> whats the tax like
[7:59] <Kizzycocoa> ?10,000. wow. I could build half a house with that
[7:59] <Nerdy> Speaking of pay-pal. it sucks. We need google checkout
[7:59] <Drakkar> remember he's swedish
[7:59] <Kokopure> O_O
[7:59] <Leiche> still quite a lot.
[7:59] <OpalMist> ColdFusion: You've got to do it in front of a mirror.
[7:59] <Drakkar> so its pretty obscene
[7:59] <Quatroking> and the total tax is what, Notch, 60%?
[8:00] <Kokopure> if someone else buys one, I'll buy one
[8:00] <Kizzycocoa> if I could build houses on my own
[8:00] <Diablodoct0r> He earnes almost 5,000 Euros a day
[8:00] <Diablodoct0r> happy?
[8:00] <Quatroking> still, 4K for just one day

[8:00] <Kizzycocoa> %60? O-O

[8:00] <Prime_Intellect> that's pretty crazy
[8:00] <Kizzycocoa> WAY to high!
[8:00] <Diablodoct0r> Quatroking: tax is 50-55% he said

[8:19] <Kizzycocoa> no, he should spend it on his house, or to pay off stuff. like a sensible person would :3
[8:19] <commandhat> I think Nonoba will rent their huge-ass servers for cheap... perhaps a 80 slot server XD?
[8:19] <Fisheatsbear> "Everyone" wisp?

[8:33] <Jest3r> Notch: I'm sure Valve would be glad to help you out.
[8:33] <Notch> Cat: No, I don't hate him. Clones are good for the industry.
[8:33] <Notch> and for the customer
[8:33] <Flamester> Notch is here?!?
[8:33] <ZarroTsu> No
[8:33] <TheCactusman> Like Tetris clones, notch.
[8:33] <CompuHacker> Of course.

[8:33] <Jest3r> And indeed. A currency system would be great for when SMP comes out.
[8:33] <lifeless> Hay notch have u seen inception?
[8:33] <SmokestormX> So the server gets 3 connects attems per second , How many requests for new features do you get per second Notch?
[8:34] <CompuHacker> Notch! Go read the suggestions forum, heading "Display Cases"
[8:34] <Prime_Intellect> man i feel sorry for him; he must be getting so many alerts
[8:34] <lifeless> If you have
[8:34] <Demki> jest3r, I don't think it would be needed
[8:34] <ZarroTsu> I'm specific to the spinning-coin-while-on-ground bit :[
[8:34] <lifeless> YOUR IN A DREAM
[8:34] <CompuHacker> I demand it.
[8:34] <lifeless> lol
[8:34] <tons0phun> I must say, it is remarkable what Notch has done with this concept since he played Infiniminer.
[8:34] <Prime_Intellect> SmokestormX: ROFL
[8:34] <Mithril> 1009
[8:34] <tons0phun> anybody else here play infiniminer when it came around?
[8:34] <Jest3r> Demki: Having a certain currency would be pretty good, though.
[8:34] <Prime_Intellect> no
[8:34] <vede> Jest3r, one of the awesome things about Minecraft is that you can make your own currency system. There's no need for the game to explicitly say "Okay, this is currency."
[8:34] <Jest3r> As an optional feature for servers.

[8:35] <CompuHacker> :D
[8:35] <Demki> miclee: the cookie isn't a lie.
[8:35] <CompuHacker> If some empire decides to use half-blocks for currency, they would only have 1 story buildings.
[8:35] <Prime_Intellect> Flamester: he's talked about that somewhere
[8:35] <Kokopure> ...
[8:35] <Jest3r> And the government employees of that server would look for that lab to take it down
[8:35] <ZarroTsu> :|
[8:35] <tons0phun> I'm hoping that in time, Notch will make the levels generate as they do in Dwarf Fortress
[8:35] <CompuHacker> or a lot of ladders.
[8:35] <Prime_Intellect> i think in the latest update

[8:36] <Jest3r> Minus taxes, sadly.
[8:37] <tons0phun> does anybody know if Notch is considering adding Human AI characters or dialogue boxes?
[8:37] <HiiragiTsukasa> Actually Jest3r
[8:37] <HiiragiTsukasa> That's AFTER taxes
[8:37] <CompuHacker> Oh yes, I want a craftable equalizer.
[8:37] <ZarroTsu> <SmokestormX> And what do you do with these coins? collect 99 for an extra life? <- trade for goods, recombine for gold bars for gold blocks for storage
[8:37] <Jest3r> Ah, right.
[8:37] <CompuHacker> As a weapon, of course.

[8:37] <Jest3r> Exactly ZarroTsu, I like the idea of coins. They could be crafted optionally
[8:37] <HiiragiTsukasa> Geeze Foshie
[8:37] <Jest3r> Like a simple extraction of Gold Ore
[8:38] <ZarroTsu> Reguardless of if ANYONE uses it, minecraft would profit (yuk yuk yuk) from currency

It might be buggy, but I promise to fix it when I get back. It will be missing mobs. Mobs will come later on, and when they?re in, the game will officially be in beta, and the price will go up to 14.95 euro.
[9:35] <HiiragiTsukasa> Oh hell yes
[9:35] <Hunter712> I expect to see Minecraft on steam in the future
[9:35] <Dark207> alpha people should get a star next to their name
[9:35] <Dark207> so people know we're leet
[9:35] <CyanRyan> if the tf2 community starts pouring in here, we should remove the 375 user limit
[9:35] <Inverness> Yes
[9:35] <Hunter712> The TF2 blog post does more than justice for Minecraft
[9:36] <HiiragiTsukasa> Meh
[9:36] <Hunter712> It sounds more like they want to be in contact with Notch.
[9:36] <CyanRyan> not even Valve can resist Minecraft's awesomeness
[9:36] <HiiragiTsukasa> I don't really have a fancy for Valve's fans
[9:36] <Inverness> I've read TF2 forum, noticed a lot of people turned off because they don't know what alpha is all about

[9:38] <JacobR248> I'm not either.
[9:38] <Dark207> it's bullcrap

[9:39] <Kitoari> Steam is ok.
[9:39] <Dark207> No it's horrible
[9:39] <JacobR248> They make you get a new map pack if you want to play any game mode each time a new one comes out.
[9:39] <Dark207> there's loads of users having problems patching
[9:39] <Inverness> Why do you say that?
[9:39] <Kitoari> hmm
[9:39] <Dark207> which may pose a big problem if notch puts minecraft on steam

[9:41] <Dark207> it constantly crashes for me and such

[9:41] <HiiragiTsukasa> Only Valve game
[9:41] <commandhat> Hunter712: even with absolutely everyones' friends list being cleared a few months back?

[9:47] <Hunter712> You didn't read that
[9:47] <Hunter712> Did you?
[9:47] <Hunter712> There was a fix

[9:49] <Hunter712> Not to mention, at the very end of that thread, valve is giving progress stats on how far they are in the fix
[9:49] <bza> weird!
[9:49] <Hunter712> Most dev groups fix problems like these within three or four days, maybe even weeks.
[9:50] <Hunter712> Groups controlled by EA and Activision, which is 80% of the PC gaming developer group
[9:51] <Hunter712> Now Commandhat is spamming me with logs I don't care about
[9:51] <Inverness> I remember the days when EA was the evil overlord, and now its Activision which is even worse
[9:51] <Hunter712> It's as if I don't believe him about the bug

[9:53] <Hunter712> There was one bug
[9:53] <Hunter712> Boo hoo
[9:53] <Hunter712> it was fixed in a day
[9:53] <commandhat> more then one
[9:53] <commandhat> that was just a tiny example
[9:53] <Budda> [04:51:58] <Inverness> if EA is Grindelwald, then Activision is Voldemort
[9:53] <commandhat> google "steam bug"
[9:53] <Hunter712> Oh god, Steam doesn't work for me
[9:53] <Budda> wow good timing
[9:53] <Budda> i just watched the hp7 trailer
[9:53] <Budda> lol
[9:54] <commandhat> anyway we should probably take this topic into another chat before Quatro boots us
[9:54] <Hunter712> It's funny that you're the only one here that has had these issues Command, and are taking them to a higher offense
[9:54] <Inverness> TRAILER
[9:54] <bza> would people get pissed if minecraft were on steam?
[9:54] <bza> just curious

[9:54] <memzak> Hi
[9:54] <Hunter712> I wouldn't
[9:54] <commandhat> Some.
[9:54] <Raws> I love Steam so much, but I'm totally disappointed by cruftiness of the Mac version :(
[9:54] <Mithril> wow its up to 1073 already
[9:54] <commandhat> Definitely not all.
[9:54] <Raws> +the
[9:54] <Hunter712> I could just imagine achievements, and official playtime recording
[9:54] <memzak> Hi? :s
[9:54] <bza> cause there are a good chunk of indie games on it
[9:54] <Inverness> I don't know about achievements
[9:54] <Raws> 'lo memzak
[9:54] <bza> haha
[9:55] <memzak> :D
[9:55] <Hunter712> Alot of indie devs depend on steam
[9:55] <Inverness> steamworks doesn't work on linux, does it?
[9:55] <bza> Achievement Unlocked: Group Hug!
[9:55] <memzak> Could someone do me a favor
[9:55] <Hunter712> Not yet
[9:55] <commandhat> Nope inverness
[9:55] <bza> killed by 3+ creepers
[9:55] <commandhat> Not yet anyway
[9:55] <Hunter712> They're working on it :T
[9:55] <Inverness> Would need to wait for stuff like that, then
[9:55] <commandhat> But steam will eventually make their stuff work on linux
[9:55] <bza> yeah they need to work on steamplay more
[9:55] <bza> but also, a lot of the gaming performance stuff falls on apple
[9:55] <commandhat> it's just a matter of time until they decide to add linux support
[9:56] <memzak> Anyone willing to do so?
[9:56] <commandhat> or they're working on it and I'm out of the news loop :@
[9:56] <bza> people poking around in GCFs found linux related stuff
[9:56] <bza> so they're definitely working on it
[9:56] <pontusedberg> i now have a pet creeper :D
[9:56] <commandhat> ^ exactly
[9:56] <pontusedberg> he is so cute :D
[9:56] <memzak> Anyone want to do me a small favor?

[10:17] <Hyst> can you expand the limit by 10 people?
[10:17] <Keiya_> HiiragiTsukasa: Lucky
[10:17] <Keiya_> Gold is useless
[10:17] <HiiragiTsukasa> I had found at least 50 diamonds
[10:17] <Quatroking> Idea: what if we can place ore chunks?
[10:17] <HiiragiTsukasa> One cave even gave me 17 in one visit
[10:17] <Foshie> 1100 sales in 24 hours.. :P
[10:17] <HiiragiTsukasa> But gold is like
[10:17] <HiiragiTsukasa> Rare for me
[10:17] <HiiragiTsukasa> Thankfully though
[10:17] <Quatroking> but instead of a big block, small blocks suitable for decoration?
[10:17] <HiiragiTsukasa> Gold is so useless..
[10:17] <CompuHacker> I spawned on a snowy map directly on top of a sand filled dungeon
[10:18] <CompuHacker> there was two diamonds in the chest.
[10:18] <CompuHacker> what a day.

[10:19] <HiiragiTsukasa> At least that's what these stupid slimes seem like they'd do
[10:19] <HiiragiTsukasa> I hate slimes
[10:19] <Scoth> hehe
[10:19] <Fantafuzz> Theyll probably spawn in my strip mine though

It might be buggy, but I promise to fix it when I get back. It will be missing mobs. Mobs will come later on, and when they?re in, the game will officially be in beta, and the price will go up to 14.95 euro.

[10:35] <Lisimba> Bigjam starts august 6, which is friday next week. I don't know when notch leaves but I'd guess he has some more dev time early next week, so no smp server tomorrow.
[10:35] <Drakkar> not me
[10:35] <pontusedberg> and about 90 art creatures from ib!
[10:35] <Hyst> so what exactly has been updated from Infdev?

[10:38] <Quatroking> hahaha
[10:38] <wolf_alex> idk
[10:38] <Drakkar> I think I may go for an HTC model
[10:38] <wolf_alex> somtime
[10:38] <Quatroking> you mean "if"
[10:38] <Drakkar> its hard to decide though
[10:38] <Nerdy> SSC it is for everybody
[10:38] <Drakkar> because there's already a fully functional, smooth running, psx emulator for android phones
[10:38] <SnowmanHTC> HTC Desire is almost unique to the Nexus One
[10:38] <SSC> ok ^^
[10:38] <wolf_alex> true quatro
[10:38] <SnowmanHTC> Which I originally wantes
[10:38] <wolf_alex> may I ask whats the connection between l4d1 and l4d2
[10:39] <mib_1zh0if> looks like quatroking doesn't know how the internet works
[10:39] <JamesK89> Both have zombies
[10:39] <JamesK89> That is all.
[10:39] <Tukiko> wolf_alex: There's a level in L4D2 DLC that crosses the two groups.
[10:39] <Tukiko> in a*
[10:39] <JamesK89> Its pretty lame given all the hype about it
[10:39] <SnowmanHTC> wolf_alex, L4D2 takes place a week after L4D1

[10:39] <SnowmanHTC> Same zombie wave, different locations
[10:39] <Tukiko> Hell, each level of L4D doesn't even connect with the other besides the fact that it has the same characters.
[10:40] <wolf_alex> tukiko fan dlc or official dlc
[10:40] <Tukiko> official
[10:40] <Drakkar> yeah SnowmanHTC I'm sort of quibbling
[10:40] <wolf_alex> free?
[10:40] <JamesK89> Of course!
[10:40] <Scoth> There's the one "the passing" level or something
[10:40] <JamesK89> Its Valve, not Activision
[10:40] <Keiya_> wolf_alex: Depends. Are you a PC gamer?
[10:40] <Tukiko> I dunno, I didn't buy L4D2
[10:40] * tarpsocks (tarpdocks@216.26.96.116) has joined #minecraft
[10:40] <wolf_alex> keiya yeah
[10:40] <Keiya_> It's free on the PC. You have to pay on the 360
[10:40] <wolf_alex> lol
[10:40] <Keiya_> Microsoft doesn't like free stuff aparently :P
[10:40] <SnowmanHTC> Drakkar, I got this one because Google kept delaying the Nexus One here and I got sick of it
[10:40] <JamesK89> The only reason you have to pay on the 360 was because Microsoft insisted all DLCs have a minimum price
[10:40] <wolf_alex> yet another reason valve sucks on the 360
[10:40] <Drakkar> haha
[10:41] <Drakkar> yeah I feel you on that
[10:41] <Tukiko> Keiya_: There are plenty of free DLCs on XBL. :P
[10:41] <bza> i'm curious about portal 2 on ps3
[10:41] <bza> what sort of steam stuff will be involved
[10:41] <SnowmanHTC> It's basically the same anyway, some minor differences

[10:42] <bioComputist> So
[10:42] <bioComputist> I'm playing Alpha
[10:42] <bioComputist> How the screw do I get some rock when I break it down?
[10:42] <Tukiko> Keiya_: That's because the devs decided to charge for it. Microsoft already gets paid to develop games for the xbox and to just use the XBL service, so they don't require charging money for DLCs
[10:42] <commandhat> pickaxe
[10:42] <vede> bioComputist, make a pickaxe first.

[10:46] <Quatroking> or are you not manly enough?
[10:47] <JamesK89> L4D2 looks better, but I prefer the night time of L4D1
[10:47] <Bodie_> wolf_alex: only if you're from australia
[10:47] <JamesK89> L4D2 is mostly day time
[10:47] <Bodie_> because the gore is removed :p
[10:47] <Bodie_> it looks stupid
[10:47] <underd0g> L4D is better than the sequel imho. I don't know why, but I got bored with L4D2 very quickly.
[10:47] <vede> C418, if you do lots of drum and bass stuff, might you be willing to contribute some work for an open source FPS project? I know they're looking for music like what you have on that page you linked, C418.
[10:47] <Ominus> yes l4d1 felt more eerie than l4d2
[10:47] <JamesK89> L4D2's multiplayer is way better though
[10:47] <Ominus> underd0g same here
[10:47] <JamesK89> I like the scavange game mode
[10:48] <Ominus> i still prefer l4d1 over l4d2

[11:18] <Brotagonist> Well then let me just get right the fouck out of that conversation.
[11:18] <Randomnation> well, SMP doesn't seem like it'd be that fun without monsters or killing eachother
[11:18] <bioComputist> Spiiider
[11:18] <EmpiresBane> you can normally only attack adjacent squares
[11:18] <Brotagonist> Because my entire basis doesn't matter int hat game.
[11:18] <bioComputist> Make a bow Doctoor!

[11:25] <Heinami> I thought it went beta when Notch says it's beta.
[11:25] <Fisheatsbear> notch said this
[11:25] <commandhat> "In more concrete news, I noticed that BIGJam starts next week. I will release the SMP server before I leave for that. It might be buggy, but I promise to fix it when I get back. It will be missing mobs. Mobs will come later on, and when they???re in, the game will officially be in beta, and the price will go up to 14.95 euro."

[11:29] <So_Useless> Like a toilet.
[11:29] <So_Useless> There we go, I guess... but a broken toilet that doesn't flush.
[11:29] <Jevon> Its mostly CSS and TF2
[11:29] <wolf_alex> css is not fun

[11:30] <wolf_alex> I never found a normal assault server
[11:30] <Firetempest> thats a simile
[11:30] <So_Useless> Right, because those are popular. Valve doesn't attract shit intrinsicaly, Shitpeople are attracted to competitive, online fps games, and valve just happens to make good ones.
[11:30] <wolf_alex> 2 teams attacking from a base like in tf2
[11:30] <wolf_alex> regular maps
[11:30] <Brotagonist> I buy things from amazon whan I am bore

[11:30] <Jevon> They arent good games
[11:30] <Jevon> they are mediocre at best
[11:31] <So_Useless> Well, I can't argue for CSS, I haven't played it, but I think tf2 is very fun when you find good people to play with.

[12:02] <NMLittle> Because it is a thinking game.
[12:02] <Brotagonist> Why are so many people obese?
[12:02] <Snuggletummy> Too complicated.
[12:02] <NMLittle> Unlike many of the games out there, DF requires thought and planning.
[12:02] <Snuggletummy> Because obese people like food.
[12:02] <Krysonian> I can't wait until SMP, seriously. I will be playing it all the time.
[12:02] <Krysonian> How about an SMP discussion in here, #MineCraft?

[12:03] <DEElekgolo> lol what
[12:03] <DEElekgolo> ascii to 3d?
[12:03] <NMLittle> Yup
[12:03] <NMLittle> ascii with x-y and z axis

[12:04] <DEElekgolo> reading
[12:04] <DEElekgolo> in 3d.
[12:04] <Brotagonist> MENUS
[12:04] <NMLittle> But you can take the top sheet off to see what is under it, or add a sheet to see what is on top.

[12:04] <TheCactusman> Hi everyone.
[12:04] <DEElekgolo> oh
[12:04] <Brotagonist> Like the books you read in school with them pictures of the human body, and each clear sheet had a set of organs or something on it.
[12:04] <Brotagonist> and all that was left was the bottom, skeleton

[12:05] <Skyl3lazer> of a cliff.
[12:05] <uwlb> love the minecraft music
[12:05] <NMLittle> Yes, But the sheet isn't clear.
[12:05] <DEElekgolo> so since the menus are ascii, lots of people exploit that to make it more "pretty"
[12:05] <DEElekgolo> ic ic
[12:05] <Skyl3lazer> Imagine four balls on the edge of a cliff.
[12:05] <NMLittle> But they overlay on each other exactly
[12:05] <Skyl3lazer> Say a direct copy of the ball nearest the cliff is sent to the back of the line of balls and takes the place of the first ball.
[12:05] <Skyl3lazer> he formerly first ball becomes the second, the second becomes the third, and the fourth falls off the cliff. Time works the same way.

[12:28] <Phil> It's rather humorous the difference between Notch to gamers experience versus AAA company to gamers experience, and the games they provide. Minecraft is more fun than any AAA title ive played, probably all year and longer
[12:28] <Crodor> god, while i'm killing the ones in front of me, even more spawn behind me T.T
[12:28] <Clannad> does anybody have experience with modding minecraft?
[12:28] <sonime> i meant to type it as the command

[12:50] <bioComputist> It seems the download links are not linked to accounts, so someone could share the game download link and unregistered users could download it
[12:51] <bioComputist> INTERESTING
[12:51] <Christoph> It's just like the shrubs.
[12:51] <Snowman> It was just done with torches and flowers and shrooms
[12:51] <Snowman> And shrubs
[12:51] <Christoph> But you can actually place these in survival.
[12:51] <Merkurlicht> Genemos, you can do a circuit with red torches to let them switch automatically
[12:51] <Kitoari> bio: you still need to login from the client though, iirc
[12:51] <bioComputist> Ah yeah
[12:51] <Genemos> know how?
[12:51] <Jevon> kek
[12:51] <bioComputist> Just noticed that now
[12:51] <Spuddy> Okay quick unrelated question
[12:51] <Genemos> got rails, and I got redstone
[12:51] <Spuddy> what does iirc mean
[12:51] <Christoph> The difference, of course, is that shrubs, torches, and shrooms don't work that way anymore.
[12:51] <bioComputist> If i Remember correctly
[12:51] <Kitoari> if I recall correctly, iirc
[12:51] <bioComputist> Hmmm, actually

[13:21] <Phil> Sire: why?
[13:21] <Phil> oh Isee, so coal is way better
[13:21] <SireTRM> You use two sticks per piece of meat, no waste.
[13:22] <Snowman> Back in the old days, when coal gave stair blocks :D
[13:22] <Lisimba> Coal lasts longer but is harder to get than wood.
[13:22] <SireTRM> Ah, yes.
[13:22] <Snowman> Coal was useful back then

[13:23] <Phil> just smack it until it pops loose
[13:23] <Phil> lol
[13:23] <Phil> like everything in this game
[13:23] <Lisimba> Two wood gives four sticks, so two sticks is one wood. Two sticks lasts 10 seconds, one wood lasts 15 seconds. You may as well use wood then.
[13:23] <GreyMaria> "smack it untiul it pops loose"
[13:23] <Hippie_McHippyson> You need a good enough pickaxe for better materials though
[13:23] <ChJees> Shovel = Anything that isn't rock or a Tree

[13:23] <Hippie_McHippyson> just get a shovel or hit it
[13:23] <Hippie_McHippyson> for stone
[13:23] <Phil> Snugg: thats how I deliver everything
[13:23] <Hippie_McHippyson> you need a pickaxe

[14:01] <GreenHoopla> It's just sometimes I can't conncet to servers
[14:01] <GreenHoopla> No idea why.

[14:01] <vede> He should use cobblestone walls and smooth stone because your mother is a slut, Krysonian.
[14:01] <Guard> and omg she was hilarious.... :P

[14:03] <GreenHoopla> nevermind.
[14:03] <GreenHoopla> Bah, Garry's mod has failed me :(
[14:04] <Christoph> I'm not sure.
[14:04] <GreenHoopla> 280 hours put into it, and now it's not working.
[14:04] <GreenHoopla> And no, Krys
[14:04] <Neoboy80> Greenhoopla, doesn't it always do that?
[14:04] <GreenHoopla> Sometimes, but usually it works.
[14:04] <Christoph> I sent a picture to MY mother, and she suggested smooth walls with cobble flooring.

[14:05] <LoKiPP> how do you grow trees?
[14:05] <Snowman> Well, I say Snow walls and Snow floors
[14:05] <Neoboy80> Oh
[14:05] <Christoph> Basically, I want it to look sort of spartan.
[14:05] <Krysonian> FULL BAMBOO.

[14:05] <GreenHoopla> Ah I know the problem
[14:05] <Neoboy80> Then walls out of cobble
[14:05] <GreenHoopla> for some reason the game started without updating all the way
[14:05] <GreenHoopla> :P
[14:05] <Zerim> In the last 24 hours, 5656 people registered, and 1289 people bought the game.
[14:05] <Zerim> ohmygod
[14:05] <Christoph> Oh man, I have so much papyrus I have absolutely no use for.
[14:05] <Neoboy80> Maybe put some mossy cobblestone in places if you have it
[14:06] <Neoboy80> I have a papyrus farm
[14:06] <ChR1S> Cant join that one snow :(
[14:06] <Neoboy80> It looks nice

[14:06] <Neoboy80> ish
[14:06] <Christoph> I made a multi story generator for it.
[14:06] <Christoph> And it is so useless.
[14:06] <Christoph> Because I don't need any more bookshelves.
[14:06] <Snowman> :/
[14:06] <Snowman> Crashed for me as well
[14:06] <GreenHoopla> Odd.
[14:06] <LoKiPP> does anyone know how to grow trees?
[14:06] <Christoph> Is there a craft recipe for mosstone?
[14:06] <GreenHoopla> But yeah, my game hadn't updated all the way before starting
[14:07] <Neoboy80> We need a better use for papyrus
[14:07] <ChR1S> Place them on the grounf
[14:07] <Snuggletummy> The fire alarm just went off in my dorm.
[14:07] <Neoboy80> Since it's so easy to farm
[14:07] <ChR1S> and pray to the Notch god for rain
[14:07] <Snuggletummy> I go outside expecting a giant fire.
[14:07] <Snuggletummy> What do I get?
[14:07] <ChR1S> Fire?
[14:07] <Neoboy80> No, christoph
[14:07] <Snuggletummy> 5 fire trucks, 3 police cars.
[14:07] <LoKiPP> this game has rain?
[14:07] <Neoboy80> You must find it in dungeons or cheat it into your inventory
[14:07] <underd0g> Someone tell me why TF2 is unique and more fun than other FPSes. It's cel shading, sure, but what else?
[14:07] <Neoboy80> Although notch took out the dungeons didn't he
[14:07] <Christoph> Man, what a pain.
[14:07] <GreenHoopla> Snow, found one
[14:07] <GreenHoopla> 81.19.212.130:27015
[14:07] <GreenHoopla> its loading for me atm
[14:07] <Snowman> K
[14:07] <Snuggletummy> An army of fire fighters all rushed in to save the day.
[14:07] <Christoph> No.
[14:08] <Hippie_McHippyson> TF2 is a great FPS because of it's humor, setting and class-based gameplay.
[14:08] <Snuggletummy> What did they find?
[14:08] <Christoph> They're still in the game.
[14:08] <Snuggletummy> A burnt piece of bacon.
[14:08] <Neoboy80> "Gentlemen."
[14:08] <Snuggletummy> Retards.

[14:08] <Christoph> I have a path leading to my spider dungeon right now.
[14:08] <Neoboy80> TF2 is (probably) the only FPS that you can throw jars of piss at people in
[14:08] <underd0g> Is it imbalanced? Are there inferior classes?
[14:08] <Snuggletummy> ^ So true
[14:08] <Snuggletummy> No.
[14:08] <Snuggletummy> Not unbalanced at all.
[14:08] * konrr (omfgconnor@91.109.100.10) has joined #minecraft
[14:08] <Christoph> The classes are all fairly well balanced.
[14:08] <Hippie_McHippyson> no, but the forums will make you think there are
[14:08] <Snuggletummy> Or, imbalanced*
[14:09] <Christoph> Ok.
[14:09] * duckson (mb@ip4da6dc53.direct-adsl.nl) Quit (Quit: duckson)
[14:09] <Hippie_McHippyson> because the forum people are mostly whiny bitches that want to nerf every class they don't play
[14:09] <Christoph> So I have two votes for cobblestone walls with smooth stone floors.
[14:09] <Raijouta> obsidian walls with obsidian floors
[14:09] <Raijouta> DO IT
[14:09] <Christoph> I think I'll go with that, since the smoothstone is a brighter color.
[14:09] <Neoboy80> So I just started up minecraft and instead of the menu saying minecraft it says "1k IN 24H"
[14:09] <Christoph> Oh man.
[14:09] <Neoboy80> I giggled at notches happiness
[14:09] <underd0g> Like in APB then. "nerf sniper", "nerf N-TEC", "nerf LTL", "nerf OCAs"

[14:09] <Hippie_McHippyson> there are inferior classes to others, it's called counters. Like, a pyro is a counter to spy because he can blow his cover easily
[14:09] <Raijouta> So?
[14:10] <Raijouta> MORE OBSIDIAN FOR THE OBSIDIAN GOD
[14:10] <Neoboy80> Christoph, one bucket of water, go deep into the earth

[14:10] <Neoboy80> Drop bucket

[14:10] <Neoboy80> And then I hope you have a diamond pick. :D
[14:10] <Raijouta> ...so I just started up the game and the yellow text quoted a Vanilla Ice song
[14:10] <Raijouta> :|
[14:10] <Hippie_McHippyson> that makes the players have to play as a team, which makes it a great game
[14:10] <Snowman> GreenHoopla, the server you're trying to conenct is running an older version of the game
[14:11] <Hippie_McHippyson> well... most of the times. There are these games, then there are 24/7 2fort servers with instaspawn.
[14:11] <GreenHoopla> Bah
[14:11] <Christoph> I don't have a diamond pick, so making obsidian down there would be a bad idea.

[14:11] <GreenHoopla> :(
[14:11] <Snowman> Yes
[14:11] <Neoboy80> Well, obsidian is a bad idea then
[14:11] <GreenHoopla> I get all the updates and stuff though.
[14:11] <Christoph> Crap.
[14:12] <Neoboy80> I wish TNT wouldn't blow up EVERYTHING
[14:12] <Christoph> I can't decide.
[14:12] <Snowman> Oh well, I'll just play some MW2
[14:12] <Neoboy80> so you could use it for fast mining
[14:12] <GreenHoopla> alright then
[14:12] <GreenHoopla> I'll actually play minecraft
[14:12] <Christoph> I even made small models of each of the different designs to see which one I like.

[14:13] <Christoph> That's probably a good idea, Neo...
[14:13] <Neoboy80> Yeah
[14:13] <Inverness> that I can plant in the ceiling of tunnels under sand and make a collapsing tunnel or something
[14:13] <Neoboy80> Never make a building all smooth stone first if you're planning on having variation

[14:15] <HiiragiTsukasa> But I'm wondering if the higher the pitch the smaller the cave

[14:15] <Neoboy80> Interesting theory
[14:15] <Christoph> Nnn. I don't know. When I've been in large caves, I've heard various sounds play.
[14:16] * Azure (Azure@pool-74-96-10-198.washdc.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[14:16] <Hippie_McHippyson> they do give you an idea of where caves are
[14:16] <Hippie_McHippyson> they are not truly ambient
[14:16] <Raijouta> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[14:16] <Hippie_McHippyson> they are directional
[14:16] <HiiragiTsukasa> Yes
[14:16] <Hippie_McHippyson> so you will hear them more clearly if you are nearer
[14:16] <HiiragiTsukasa> But what I'm wondering is if certain sounds are used for certain cave sizes
[14:16] * paradoxplus (ashleyhear@cpc1-lanc4-0-0-cust807.brig.cable.ntl.com) has left #minecraft
[14:16] <HiiragiTsukasa> Like the big, deep, booming sound = large cave

[14:17] <Hippie_McHippyson> I have a big cave under my base and so far I only heard thunders and other low pitched sounds

[14:47] <Visiiri> And, well, now I'm here.
[14:47] <bioComputist> Because our sex is inditerminate until a late stage in pregnancy, so the body forms nipples even though the male will never use them
[14:47] <Wisp> Because gender isnt decided until later in pregnancy
[14:47] <Wisp> ^that
[14:47] <bioComputist> Visiiri, your uncle was going to have you charged with Grand Theft Auto? REALLY?

[15:15] <amz181> what i find really annoying, is that you have to start a new world to get most of the updates >:-(
[15:15] <Rooster> http://filesmelt.com/dl/1337sales.bmp
[15:15] <wibbles> you can with start snow with NBTedit btw
[15:15] <Hippie_McHippyson> actually only for a few of them
[15:15] <blackosprey> that's what I thought amz, but apparently only new materials.
[15:15] <Hippie_McHippyson> for snow and for redstone
[15:15] <blackosprey> Snow, redstone, and probably clay too.
[15:15] <blackosprey> Err.
[15:15] <amz181> i swear its happened for nearly every friday update
[15:15] <Neoboy80> Even with redstone, couldn't you just walk into a new chunk and it would have a chance to spawn in it?
[15:15] <bleak> amz181 i haven't had to restart my world for anything, just generate new chunks
[15:15] <blackosprey> That's true.
[15:16] <amz181> :O
[15:16] <bleak> a.k.a. pick a direction and walk for 5 minutes
[15:16] <Neoboy80> It's just snow that you really have to generate a new world for

[15:21] <EmpiresBane> and now you're gonna suggest Chrome
[15:21] <Snowman> Nope, opera
[15:21] <Zaneo> Firefox
[15:21] <Hippie_McHippyson> Firefox actually
[15:21] <amz181> chrome is crap
[15:21] <wibbles> I suggest firefox actually
[15:21] <Cheeseum> tax is 25%
[15:22] <Hippie_McHippyson> or Safari
[15:22] <amz181> and so is opera
[15:22] <Cheeseum> fees are like 3% or something
[15:22] <EmpiresBane> firefox is kinda slow...
[15:22] <wibbles> I like opera, but ithas some compatability issues
[15:22] <Zaneo> 3.6.4, the 4.0 beta is meh
[15:22] <Snowman> EmpiresBane, use Opera
[15:22] <Snowman> Blazing fast
[15:22] <Quatroking> I suggest not caring about what everyone says and just try various browsers out and stick to what works best
[15:22] <Horrible> Well
[15:22] <bleak> chrome
[15:22] <EmpiresBane> i was thinking of downloading that
[15:22] <Hippie_McHippyson> firefox is one of the fastest browsers
[15:22] <EmpiresBane> Chrome is just fail
[15:22] <wibbles> Er, a lot of speed is based on your internet connection
[15:22] <EmpiresBane> ...
[15:22] <Horrible> Use Midori, it's faster than Opera. :3
[15:22] <Snowman> Agreed
[15:22] <Hippie_McHippyson> definitely more than IE
[15:22] <amz181> dont listen to quat, he knows nusing
[15:22] <EmpiresBane> somebody needs to mack you wibbles
[15:22] <Quatroking> use windows explorer
[15:22] <Snowman> And Firefox is more like FireSlow
[15:22] <bleak> guys use safari for windows :V
[15:22] <Snowman> So I use Opera
[15:22] <amz181> opera doesnt work for anything
[15:23] <dreamparacite> ANYTHING is better than IE, thats all you need to know
[15:23] <Hippie_McHippyson> use DOS
[15:23] <bioComputist> Even with taxes
[15:23] <bleak> use SeaMonkey
[15:23] <amz181> i concur with dream
[15:23] <wibbles> IE is actually les secure than other browsers
[15:23] <Horrible> Owait, you'd need to install Linux to use Midori. :3
[15:23] <Zaneo> IE doesn't even work for me
[15:23] <dreamparacite> A rock is better than IE for surfing the internet
[15:23] <Zaneo> it can't connect to webpages
[15:23] <bioComputist> Nook has made 288682.5 Euros
[15:23] <Snowman> amz181, Opera has 100/100 on Acid3 test

[15:23] <bleak> i use rocks made of computers
[15:23] <Quatroking> bioComputist, nah

[15:23] <Zaneo> Quatro what's your os?
[15:23] <EmpiresBane> IE works for most stuff
[15:23] <Quatroking> he pays about 50%-55% tax
[15:23] <wibbles> I deleted the shortcut to IE to delete it

[16:00] <Mopquill> You mentioned discussing it on here
[16:00] <Quatroking> Yeah
[16:00] <Rikachu> I'm just saying, it needs more information.
[16:00] <Quatroking> well
[16:00] * Scrippy (runs_with_@pool-71-191-176-121.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has left #minecraft
[16:00] <Mopquill> and at this point, it's gotten to where we really just need to enforce what you decide.
[16:00] <Quatroking> I got lazy?
[16:00] <Visiiri> Rikachu: Add it, you so selfish
[16:00] * Scrippy (runs_with_@pool-71-191-176-121.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[16:00] <Mopquill> Well, no, that's okay.
[16:01] <Zaneo> They have a point about the Ocean Flatgrass server being there
[16:01] <Mopquill> I'm just asking for your call on it
[16:01] <Zaneo> if one goes they both should
[16:01] <Mopquill> Well, I don't think either should be there.
[16:01] <GreyMaria> iI have 511 units of rough stone, and that's just this chest!
[16:01] <Quatroking> Lemme edit the rules a bit
[16:01] <Mopquill> I mean, it's a wiki
[16:01] <Rikachu> It truly does need more information.

[16:01] <Mopquill> To me though, it seems like it's a minecraft wiki
[16:01] * AndrewPH is now known as AndrewPH|AFK
[16:01] <Mopquill> so, it should be about minecraft, as in, Notch's minecraft
[16:01] <Mopquill> So, stuff he makes or has something to do with
[16:02] <Mopquill> people hosting private servers shouldn't have their servers on there
[16:02] <splitz> Visiiri that shirt is too big
[16:02] <Mopquill> it seems out of the scope of a wiki
[16:02] <Zaneo> so then all the circuits shouldn't be there?
[16:02] <Zaneo> notch did make those.
[16:02] <Guard> SO QUATROKING
[16:02] <Zaneo> didn't*
[16:02] <Guard> you there?
[16:02] <Mopquill> not to mention, it seems to promote the idea that one person's server somehow deserves better recognition over another in the server.jsp list for some reason.
[16:02] <Visiiri> splitz: It's a large...
[16:02] <splitz> too big

[16:04] <Visiiri> :(
[16:04] <Mopquill> with?
[16:04] <Visiiri> Why don't I have a page in the wiki
[16:04] <Visiiri> I totally deserve one
[16:04] <Visiiri> someone make me one
[16:04] <Lantris> lol
[16:04] <Mopquill> If I did
[16:04] <Mopquill> it'd be

[16:05] <Scrippy> It's not working
[16:05] <Mopquill> Well, that client works pretty well.
[16:05] <Scrippy> I've been trying to find out why for weeks
[16:05] <Mopquill> Chances are, if it's working in teh first place, you're fine
[16:05] <Scrippy> Problem is
[16:05] <Mopquill> and jqs just makes java available ever so slightly quicker
[16:05] <Mopquill> I have it disabled.
[16:05] <Scrippy> I can stand around just fine when using that client

[16:40] <Stenlay> GreyMaria, Infdev is now Minecraft alpha
[16:40] <Tekimeki> agreed with Koko
[16:40] <Koko|IGFapparently> so if you want to be able to explore "the entire world"
[16:41] <Koko|IGFapparently> go with indev
[16:41] <SireTRM> Having floating islands over a massive pit could be awesome in Alpha.

[17:47] <Visiiri> I'm so mature that everyone thinks that I'm immature.
[17:47] <JamesK89> Oh sorry
[17:47] <Visiiri> I win
[17:47] <JamesK89> I see now
[17:47] <JamesK89> My parents said I was born at 30
[17:47] <JamesK89> I guess I was unusually mature growing up
[17:47] <Phil> wow like that button freak
[17:48] <ZarroTsu> yo uwere born 16 minutes ago?
[17:48] <Animator> Oh.
[17:48] <Animator> Then forgive me.
[17:48] <EmpiresBane> don't you think an arguement over who's more mature is kinda pointless?
[17:48] <JamesK89> Its kind of ironic really
[17:48] * Batman_ is now known as [Brandon]
[17:48] <EmpiresBane> does arguying about it show youo're less mature?
[17:49] <JamesK89> A "My dad could beat up your dad" type of argument
[17:49] <WateryHell> Yea, it does.
[17:49] <Visiiri> EmpiresBane, of course. That's why you do it.

[18:08] <GreyMaria> I built one on my house
[18:08] <GreyMaria> I love dirt
[18:08] <GreyMaria> It's so easy to work with
[18:08] <Scrippy> I have a minecart expressway out of mine.
[18:08] <Scrippy> In the event of a magma flood.
[18:08] <GreyMaria> I haven't even found enough iron to build an iron pickaxe
[18:08] <Scrippy> You're gotta plan for these things, you know.
[18:08] <Scrippy> Err, you've.
[18:08] <bleak> Dirt is fucking ugly. However, since my house is made almost entirely out of cobblestone, I did put in a third floor diving board to the pool in the front yard.
[18:08] <shairn> greymaria I found enough iron to build myself a small hut out of it
[18:08] <shairn> no joke

[18:09] <TsukasaFanatic> bleak: Why is it a mistake to build a house using planks?
[18:10] <shairn> yeah, I've also got like 8 blocks of gold. spelunking gives a lot of ore.
[18:10] <Scrippy> TsukasaFanatic: Because in multiplayer, planks burn.
[18:10] <bleak> TsukasaFanatic: creeper destroys the whole first floor
[18:10] <Helar> yeah i found like 30 gold in a huuuuuuge cavesystem
[18:10] <Scrippy> Burn baby burn, disco inferno.
[18:10] <Helar> also 2 stacks of iron ;P
[18:10] <TsukasaFanatic> Scrippy: I only plan to play with friends I know on a server one of us hosts
[18:10] <bleak> What's the lowest common denominator between 9 and 64?
[18:10] <GreyMaria> I had a cow and a sheep wedged in the exit to my house once
[18:10] <Scrippy> I wish there were caves under the ocean.
[18:11] <TsukasaFanatic> bleak: I thought they did a 4x4 damage radius dispite the material

[18:11] <GreyMaria> Well, multiply 64 * 2 and 64 * 3

[18:53] <GreyMaria> Must be the perfect spot to rest!
[18:53] <Banger> i need to start using tnt
[18:53] <TsukasaFanatic> But honestly I think it's just a HUGE annoyance
[18:53] <Cheeseum> when you die
[18:53] <Sketchy> so you could use redstone and a button and detonate from farther away
[18:53] <Cheeseum> you can enjoy a nice leisurely train ride back home

[19:22] <KodaichiZerq> aka, 8 hours
[19:22] <Lisimba> Roy: preferably not together.
[19:22] <bleak> the milk fix would be easy as hell to implement I reckon
[19:23] <KodaichiZerq> nope sorry 16 hours to go
[19:23] <Roy> Of course not :P
[19:23] <bleak> and depending on what the slime balls would be used for (slime blocks?) also easy as hell

[19:45] <Banger> roy may i ask why u tend to not leave torches laying around?
[19:45] <Quatroking> Best thing is, I bought the entire thinclient for only 50 euros
[19:45] <ac1d> well the real question is, what do you torrent with it?
[19:45] <Roy> In case I need a large number of them later
[19:45] <Quatroking> this SSD is worht more than 100 at least
[19:45] <Quatroking> worth*
[19:45] <Roy> Plus I have this bad habit of leaving some areas "untouched"
[19:45] <Banger> oh i just have all the stuff i need to build a very large number of them
[19:45] <Roy> So it doesn't look like I've been there

[20:14] <ac1d> Useful because most of my time is spent on one map I made when infdev first allowed maps to be saved

[21:23] <hassifa> too short
[21:23] <TsukasaFanatic> But it's one of the most overrated games of all time

But when I press the button which is linked to the tnt. The tnt doesn't light. I checked and saw that the even through the dust was connected. The end dust wasn't lighting up.

[22:12] <Kokopure> GreyMaria, what universe do you live in where gravel looks nice
[22:12] <Phil> thats more than enough to beacon to the gods
[22:12] <Kokopure> and flint is great
[22:12] <GreyMaria> Then build an island above the clouds!
[22:12] <Kokopure> but it's only useful for flint and steel
[22:12] <GreyMaria> And watch as the zombies spawn on top of them and walk off to their doom!
