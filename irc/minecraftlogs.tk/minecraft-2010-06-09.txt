[3:44] <vurtual> parallel dimensions from quake, though open areas seem to weaken it
[3:44] <Super_Llama> if you go slowly
[3:44] <DragoonEnRegalia> As is his scary stuff with Genesis.
[3:44] <revenant> I know
[3:44] <revenant> but one mistep

[3:55] <revenant> Oh my god yes.
[3:55] <revenant> You can build above the clouds
[3:55] <DragoonEnRegalia> I could never stomach it.
[3:55] <Iguana> Who knows?
[3:55] <revenant> >:D
[3:56] <DragoonEnRegalia> Being swallowed by the flood was more admirable.
[3:56] <revenant> I am going to enjoy having a fortress about the cloud layer.
[3:56] <DragoonEnRegalia> I perished in urine. Dandy.
[3:56] <Darkebrz> Swallow the piss

[3:56] <revenant> in Infdev you can go above it.
[3:56] <vurtual> :D
[3:56] <vurtual> I found 65 iron
[3:56] <ZaxKellens> I wouldn't do that

[4:00] <vurtual> an IRC D&D game? Good idea.

[4:01] <DragoonEnRegalia> Traveller: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_%28role-playing_game%29
[4:01] <Animator> Funny. That's still not stopping me.
[4:01] <vurtual> I can certainly stop you, because not only am I a fighter pilot, I also have the reflexes of one.

[4:03] <vurtual> out|, can you fly an F/A-18?
[4:03] <DragoonEnRegalia> So hah/
[4:03] <Animator> Yeah, laziness isn't stopping me.
[4:03] <ZaxKellens> I pilot an X-Wing, which defeats your berserker (Whatever that is)
[4:03] <out|> M$ flight-sim says I can.
[4:03] <vurtual> I can also fly an X-Wing, at that.
[4:03] <Visiiri> There was that one time where I hijacked a hot air baloon.

[4:04] <Visiiri> I can now be in the IRC even LONGER

[4:04] <out|> Oh yeah? Well
[4:04] <Visiiri> Because my school year just ended!
[4:04] <Visiiri> Woo!

[4:05] <Animator> Hey guys.
[4:06] <Animator> As much as I like to see you compare e-penii with each other.
[4:06] <Animator> It's getting annoying. And obnoxious.
[4:06] <Animator> So knock it off before I start neutering you.

[4:06] <Miclee> ^^^^^
[4:06] <Visiiri> Me and ZaxKellens?
[4:06] <out|> Okay.
[4:06] <ZaxKellens> D&D is a crazy game
[4:06] <vurtual> We are a society of inherently annoying, obnoxious and elitist people, every last one of us. Me, you, that guy who is idling.
[4:06] <out|> Esper needs specific-person mutes.
[4:07] <Animator> Then I'll ban you all.
[4:07] <vurtual> It's the only thing we have common.
[4:07] <DragoonEnRegalia> Well shit.
[4:07] <Animator> Any questions, vurtual, or shall you shut up now?
[4:07] <vurtual> That's not nice :'(
[4:07] <DragoonEnRegalia> ...
[4:07] <Visiiri> I'm not elitist.
[4:07] <DragoonEnRegalia> But it's necessary.
[4:07] <Kodaichi> Most of the internet is a really hostile place
[4:07] <Visiiri> I swear.
[4:07] <out|> Sooo everyone as in even the people who aren't participating?
[4:07] <Visiiri> LKA is god...
[4:07] <Kodaichi> but sometimes people can be really kind.
[4:07] <LKA> omg.....
[4:07] <Miclee> Yes.
[4:07] <Visiiri> Hehehehe :)
[4:07] <Visiiri> <3 you baby
[4:07] <vurtual> Yes. Even that guy who is behind you, breathing down your neck. Stop breathing down my neck, guy. I just want to make a point, not get my neck breathed down.
[4:07] <Miclee> You just have to be nice and people will be nice back.
[4:08] <out|> Eventually
[4:08] <Miclee> The thing is, one person is mean, and it starts a chain.
[4:08] <Visiiri> Miclee: Your chain theory is dumb.
[4:08] <Visiiri> Therefore, you must be mean now.
[4:08] <DragoonEnRegalia> ...
[4:08] <Kodaichi> I don't believe in people breathing down my neck. That sort of thing only happens in nightmares.
[4:08] <Miclee> -_-
[4:08] <vurtual> No, you are the dumb. And then visirii took INT damage.
[4:08] <ZaxKellens> Uh oh...
[4:08] <Visiiri> Dammit, again.
[4:08] <DragoonEnRegalia> Just shish.
[4:08] <ZaxKellens> I throw a javelin at Vurtual!
[4:08] <Kodaichi> more specifically, zombies breathing down my neck, which happened once
[4:08] <Miclee> vurtual, make a channel for D&D
[4:09] <Visiiri> Yesterday, the channel hit 33 people
[4:09] <Miclee> I wanna plai
[4:09] <DragoonEnRegalia> It' annnnnnooooOOOOOOYING!
[4:09] <Visiiri> and that's STILL too many.
[4:09] <out|> Whomever's breathing down my neck needs to back off of my mouth.
[4:09] <out|> m2m dnw
[4:09] <DragoonEnRegalia> Let alone Anno...
[4:09] <Visiiri> guys, don't buy alpha protocol
[4:09] <Visiiri> I rate it a 5/10
[4:09] <ZaxKellens> Never heard of it
[4:09] <Miclee> Alpha Protocol sucked
[4:09] <Visiiri> it sucked big time.
[4:09] <DragoonEnRegalia> I was never too excited about it.
[4:09] <Visiiri> It wanted to be ME2 really bad
[4:10] <Visiiri> but it couldn't pull that off
[4:10] <Malikat> hahaha oh wow
[4:10] <vurtual> I made one Miclee
[4:10] <Miclee> Nothing can pull off a ME2.
[4:10] <Visiiri> Nope.
[4:10] <vurtual> It's +s right now and I can't even DM properly if I tried because I have no books for it.
[4:10] <DragoonEnRegalia> SEGA is so desperate to find experienced developers that it's getting to the point of sheer desperation.
[4:10] <vurtual> so I just read the SRD and try to convey vague stuff
[4:10] <ZaxKellens> Oh noes
[4:10] <Kodaichi> Me2?
[4:10] <vurtual> desperate
[4:10] <vurtual> Your turn
[4:11] <Visiiri> Mass Effect 2
[4:11] <Kodaichi> oh. k
[4:11] <Visiiri> Get that game.
[4:11] <vurtual> anwyays this concludes my EIGHT HOUR NONSTOP MINECRAFT MARATHON
[4:11] <Miclee> Play the first, though, first.
[4:11] <vurtual> donate to charity
[4:11] <ZaxKellens> I don't believe in charity
[4:11] <vurtual> donate to me, for my birthday, then.
[4:11] <Visiiri> ZaxKellens, I don't either.

[4:11] <DragoonEnRegalia> Charity is for the suicidal.
[4:11] <Visiiri> I belive in fund raising for scientific research
[4:11] <Visiiri> That's pretty fair
[4:12] <ZaxKellens> If anyone needs charity, it's me, I have no home of my own
[4:12] <out|> No, you'd most likely be donating to the wrong charity, as there is likely another charity out there that is more deserving and would probably put the money to better use.
[4:12] <Visiiri> but charity is terrible.
[4:12] <DragoonEnRegalia> If it gets me a Gundam, it's cool.
[4:12] <ZaxKellens> Gundam...
[4:12] <Visiiri> Everyone rushed to save Haiti.
[4:12] <Visiiri> I disagree.
[4:12] <ZaxKellens> I didn't
[4:12] <ZaxKellens> I hate-ee =O
[4:12] <DragoonEnRegalia> Well, a mobile suit of some kind.
[4:12] <ZaxKellens> Haiti? Hate-ee? XD
[4:12] <Visiiri> I mean, they live in a location where earthquakes are common.
[4:12] <Visiiri> They CHOSE to live there.
[4:12] <out|> If people in the general populace had ????????????s, then the world would be a horrific place.
[4:12] <Visiiri> And it's not my fault they're dirt-ass-poor.
[4:13] <ZaxKellens> That's like giving to an illinois trailer park that keeps getting hit by tornados
[4:13] <Super_Llama> http://i47.tinypic.com/2mnkwsy.jpg
[4:13] <Visiiri> Yeah
[4:13] <ZaxKellens> Don't like what the earth's throwin at you? MOVE
[4:13] <Super_Llama> that's what happens when people have connection problems
[4:13] <Visiiri> Exactly.
[4:13] <Super_Llama> (that's piderman btw)
[4:13] <Visiiri> And then there's 'hobos'
[4:13] <Visiiri> that pisses me off
[4:13] <Visiiri> EVERYONE ELSE has to get a job
[4:13] <ZaxKellens> Homos? That's mean
[4:13] <ZaxKellens> Lol
[4:13] <out|> Nice skin there llama.
[4:13] <DragoonEnRegalia> Haiti is the international equivalent of that vegetative guy in the hospital, seeping away at our resources.
[4:13] <Visiiri> but they just sit around and get paid.
[4:13] <ZaxKellens> Anyways, yeah,
[4:13] <ZaxKellens> Pull the plug and kick it out
[4:13] <Super_Llama> mine is Baman
[4:13] <Super_Llama> his is Piderman
[4:13] <Super_Llama> I made both of them though
[4:14] <vurtual> ZaxKellens, I know the tornado feeling
[4:14] <DragoonEnRegalia> Just get the citizens to other countries, so that they can have decent lives.
[4:14] <vurtual> one year or two
[4:14] <vurtual> TORNADOTORNADOTORNADOTORNADOTORNADOTORNADOTORNADO, nonstop
[4:14] <Visiiri> Yeah.
[4:14] <vurtual> I used to sing the song of storms a lot
[4:14] <vurtual> now I don't.
[4:14] <ZaxKellens> Sweet, tornados look awesome
[4:14] <Visiiri> I actually agree with that.
[4:14] <vurtual> sun's song is much nicer don't you agree.
[4:14] <ZaxKellens> The windmill song?
[4:14] <vurtual> tornados do not look awesome
[4:14] <ZaxKellens> I like the windmill song more
[4:14] <Visiiri> However, I got enough Haitians in GTA:VCS
[4:14] <vurtual> their mere presence can wreck your house
[4:14] <vurtual> By the time you can SEE them, you're in their path.
[4:14] <ZaxKellens> If you look at it from a scientific perspective, though, they're awesome
[4:15] <vurtual> not that either
[4:15] <ZaxKellens> I'm a scientist by heart, so I love things like that
[4:15] <vurtual> they're random and unpredictable
[4:15] <ZaxKellens> Waterspouts are amazing

[4:15] <Visiiri> COMPLETELY predictable.
[4:15] <out|> "Diglett used Magnitude!"
[4:15] <ZaxKellens> Super effective! Haiti was defeated!
[4:15] <vurtual> Why do they randomly shift?
[4:15] <Visiiri> Tornadoes happen.
[4:15] <ZaxKellens> vurtual : Shifts in air currents
[4:15] <vurtual> randomly go miles up hills
[4:15] <Visiiri> Why would you live there.
[4:15] <vurtual> no warning
[4:16] <vurtual> just death
[4:16] <DragoonEnRegalia> Family ties, I guess.
[4:16] <Visiiri> There's not been a natural disaster in Idaho in over 45 years
[4:16] <DragoonEnRegalia> That, and they have nowhere else to immigrate to.
[4:16] <Visiiri> I think the last one was just alot of snow
[4:16] <ZaxKellens> The destruction of humans or human property id horrible, I agree
[4:16] <Visiiri> where a dog died.
[4:16] <DragoonEnRegalia> Nice.
[4:16] <Visiiri> I mean, good place to live.

[4:18] <vurtual> ZaxKellens, you can harness tornadoes easily
[4:18] <DragoonEnRegalia> ...is Bomberman.
[4:18] <Iguana> DragoonEnRegalia, is it me, or do you act a lot more serious on the forums? :/
[4:18] <DragoonEnRegalia> Now I need to play it.
[4:18] <vurtual> the main problem with harnessing them is that if they were to suddenly become outside
[4:18] <DragoonEnRegalia> Yes I do.
[4:18] <vurtual> they'd become a whole tornado
[4:18] <ZaxKellens> Khuzdul
[4:18] <vurtual> and kill many people
[4:18] <Visiiri> It's understandable.
[4:18] <Visiiri> I mean, he has to be respected.

[4:57] <Kodaichi> I only started talking on IRC back in feb
[4:57] <ZaxKellens> When one of the creatures was a little fat man
[4:57] <Visiiri> My first time in IRC
[4:57] <Visiiri> Mai kept calling people trashhhh
[4:57] <ZaxKellens> Lol
[4:57] <Kodaichi> haha
[4:57] <Visiiri> and Annihilator_Beta kept insulting me
[4:58] <Visiiri> Then ez told him to be nice
[4:58] <Visiiri> o.o
[4:58] <Visiiri> then I left
[4:58] <Kodaichi> hmm

[4:59] <ZaxKellens> Oh
[4:59] <ZaxKellens> Notch married? o.o How old he3?
[4:59] <Miclee> People who missed what?
[4:59] <Visiiri> 31 I think
[4:59] <Shadaez> i don't think they're married yet
[4:59] <vurtual> As you enter the channel, you are suddenly aware of a large amount of people, some conversing, some relaxing. The walls are mostly white and clean, and the sound of chatter is overpowered by the calm, quiet whirr of machinery.
[4:59] <Kodaichi> vurtual and bildramer are the guys I know most. One has a habit of rapidly spouting random ideas, the other has a habit of rapidly posting random links.
[4:59] <ZaxKellens> At least he older than me
[4:59] <Cheeseyx> Getting Infdev Multiplayer
[5:00] <Cheeseyx> I didn't get it
[5:00] <Kodaichi> guess which is which
[5:00] <Miclee> Errr
[5:00] <Visiiri> Eagle: remember that one server that you invited me to that one time
[5:00] <Visiiri> and I was walking out of the spawn
[5:00] <Miclee> Nobody did.
[5:00] <Cheeseyx> Oh
[5:00] <Visiiri> and fell in a pit to the bottom of the map D:
[5:00] <Zaneo> sounds like shadowgate 64 kodaichi
[5:00] <Kodaichi> what
[5:00] <Cheeseyx> I knew pontus was a liar but...
[5:00] <Visiiri> (the one YOU dug.)
[5:00] <Eagle> Was it my server? I don't know.
[5:00] <Eagle> WAIT HAHA
[5:00] <Zaneo> except happy
[5:00] <Visiiri> I think it was.
[5:00] <Kodaichi> What does
[5:00] <Cheeseyx> Well, that makes me feel better
[5:00] <Eagle> I remember that
[5:00] <Eagle> ahahahaha
[5:00] <ZaxKellens> Ok, I gotta go
[5:00] <Visiiri> hahahaha
[5:00] <ZaxKellens> Night all, have fun
[5:00] <Kodaichi> I love that game, but what?
[5:00] <Visiiri> That was so long ago.l
[5:00] <Zaneo> oh it was vurtual, i though you had said it
[5:00] <ZaxKellens> Don't die in a creeper attack

[5:01] <vurtual> zaneo I make epic entrances when I can.
[5:01] <Visiiri> Without hacks though
[5:01] <Visiiri> :(
[5:01] <vurtual> I rarely enter.
[5:01] <Zaneo> xD
[5:01] <vurtual> If I could time travel, I'd go visit all the cool people.
[5:01] <Eagle> Without hax and without servermods?
[5:02] <vurtual> Like, Gary Gygax, Gabe Newell back in the 90s.
[5:02] <vurtual> Gene Roddenberry, Voltaire, Lyndon B Johnson.
[5:02] <Kodaichi> as you enter consciousness, you find that you are trapped in a cell and a guard has given you some disgusting greasy meat to eat as your last meal. Wat do?\
[5:02] <vurtual> Examine my surroundings.
[5:02] <Miclee> I break out.
[5:02] <Eagle> > xyzzy
[5:02] * Miclee rolls dice.
[5:02] * Miclee rolls a natural 20.
[5:02] <Kodaichi> there is hay on the ground
[5:02] <vurtual> Especially the bars of the cell, if any, the make of the stone.
[5:02] * Miclee escapes.
[5:02] <Miclee> iWin
[5:02] <Kodaichi> the meat sits there steaming
[5:03] <Kodaichi> you cannot open the door
[5:03] <Miclee> I alread won.
[5:03] <vurtual> What is the door?
[5:03] <Miclee> already*
[5:03] <Kodaichi> the prison has walls of solid rock, its underground
[5:03] <vurtual> Is it a solid metal door? bars? Do I have concealment when directly infront of it?
[5:03] <vurtual> What kind of rock? Roughly hewn?
[5:03] <vurtual> Is it dry, or moist?
[5:03] <Kodaichi> the door is solid metal with a small grate
[5:03] <Kodaichi> to see out of
[5:03] <vurtual> Half-grate? Upper half? Lower half?
[5:03] <Kodaichi> dry rock.
[5:03] <Kodaichi> upper half
[5:04] <vurtual> What is the lock type?
[5:04] <vurtual> Does it swing, or slide?
[5:04] <Miclee> I thought you made a channel for this?
[5:04] <Kodaichi> the lock can only be reached from the outside
[5:04] <vurtual> In or out?
[5:04] <Kodaichi> door =/= able to open.
[5:04] <vurtual> is it discernable?
[5:04] <Kodaichi> it is a swinging door
[5:05] <Miclee> You hear a faint growl.
[5:05] <vurtual> Does it appear to swing in or out?
[5:05] <Kodaichi> just eat the meat
[5:05] <Miclee> A gnoll breaks down the door and kills you.
[5:05] <Kodaichi> already
[5:05] <vurtual> I already have a plan.
[5:05] <Miclee> The gnoll eats the meat isntead of you.
[5:06] * Miclee has tons of D&D 3.5 books on his PC.
[5:06] <Kodaichi> bleh, it's too hard to describe
[5:06] <vurtual> I prepare wizard lock, knock, open/close, magic missile, magic missile, burning hands, charm monster, force cage, magic missile.
[5:06] <Zaneo> shadow gate was like " As you converse the perilous bridge adjoining the corridor, you misplace your foot and slide into the murky water. You gasp for air, water filling your lungs, as the burning sensation sets in you realize that you have drawn your last breath." "You are dead, Game Over"

[5:06] <Shadaez> anyone here a good DM? We should get some DND going on OpenRPG
[5:06] <Kodaichi> epic game over screens
[5:06] <Miclee> In that situation, you'd have to roll for a slip/fall.
[5:06] <vurtual> IRC works better
[5:07] <Shadaez> irc + openrpg
[5:07] <vurtual> Then I crouch at the side of the door which opens to, cast knock and then open on the door, and wait for a guard.
[5:07] <Miclee> I can DM somewhat, not incredibly well, though.
[5:07] <Zaneo> Or the one random door you open, then a troll comes out and kills you
[5:07] <Zaneo> no warning
[5:07] <vurtual> Does a guard show up, Kodaichi?
[5:07] <Miclee> Zaneo, you'd have to roll for hits/dmg/etc.
[5:07] <Kodaichi> he showed up at first, but then left
[5:07] <vurtual> the door is unlocked and open
[5:07] <vurtual> no guard?
[5:07] <Kodaichi> oh dammit i missed something
[5:08] <Kodaichi> darn it i forgot to describe YOU
[5:08] <Budda> I cast Niac's Cold ray on the Guard while his back is turned and hit him for 105. Guard is dead.
[5:08] <Shadaez> either way, I want to play dnd
[5:08] <Shadaez> I have physical books
[5:08] <vurtual> I'm a wizard,a nd niac's cold ray is a DDO-only spell shoo
[5:08] <Budda> :(:(:(
[5:08] <Kodaichi> You're a peasant with no special skills whatsoever, but you can read
[5:08] <vurtual> no, I am a wizard, you are too late.
[5:08] <Shadaez> I'm a scout
[5:08] <Zaneo> I cast escape to alternate dimension
[5:08] <Kodaichi> okay fine
[5:09] <Miclee> I have books on my PC.
[5:09] <Miclee> Tons.
[5:09] <Shadaez> not really hard to find
[5:09] <Kodaichi> if you can open the door, then you can certainly kill any of these guards
[5:09] <Budda> I cast Otto's Resistable Dance on vurtual. Vurtual is now dancing.
[5:09] <vurtual> I used knock.
[5:09] <vurtual> which opens the door for me
[5:09] <Budda> NO YOU'RE DANCING
[5:09] <Miclee> Guys, I'm gonna be hosting a D&D game tomorrow sometime.
[5:09] <Miclee> If you're interested, let me know tomorraw.
[5:09] <Kodaichi> you escape flawlessly and your name becomes known all throughout the land
[5:10] <Shadaez> over IRC or ?
[5:10] <Miclee> Yeah
[5:10] <Kodaichi> a winner is you
[5:10] <vurtual> I could run D&D right now as long as you don't ask for unique starting hit dice and lots of special abilities.
[5:10] <vurtual> or anything I can't glean from the SRD or make up
[5:10] <Budda> or
[5:10] <Budda> we all go play ddo
[5:10] <Miclee> DDO... eh
[5:10] <vurtual> yeah but we can't use our imagination :(
[5:11] <Kodaichi> I don't really want to take the time to customise anything. Can you make me a generic cleric?
[5:11] <Visiiri> Is it possible to take a good picture??
[5:11] <vurtual> Kodaichi ok
[5:11] <Miclee> DDO isn't the same as playing D&D 3.5.
[5:11] <Visiiri> I've got doubts.
[5:11] <Kodaichi> cool
[5:12] <Kodaichi> watch out I've seen her type before, that creeper's so DANGEROUS
[5:12] <Kodaichi> that creeper's a BAAAD GIRRRLLLL

[5:13] <vurtual> no that's like

[5:14] <Miclee> You know what sucks? When 3 wyrmlings attack you on a road while you're defending a caravan.
[5:14] <vurtual> but it got sold in a yard sale
[5:14] <vurtual> Then someone goes "There's plenty of other RPGs in the sea", then hands you some final fantasy tactics
[5:14] <vurtual> You'll be like "no, screw that, I want secret of mana."
[5:14] <Miclee> vurtual, what version of D&D do you play?
[5:14] <vurtual> then the sad theme kicks in, playing in your mind
[5:14] <Shadaez> I can get all these http://img151.imageshack.us/img151/6004/dndsourcerl8.png
[5:15] <Miclee> Shadaez, I have all those, pretty much.
[5:15] <vurtual> The real secret to D&D, is that you don't even need any rules.
[5:15] <Miclee> I know, vurtual, but what version?
[5:15] <vurtual> 3.5 I guess, vaguely
[5:16] <Miclee> Gud
[5:16] <Budda> what version of no rules
[5:16] <vurtual> Want kobolds to live in a post-apocalyptic city's bunker, capible of speaking common fluently? That's okay. Don't want classes? Go for that. Guns inexplicably? Do that. Suddenly make grid bugs be an enemy? That's okay too.

[5:16] <Budda> what if i want a flying scorpion that shoots lasers from its nipples?
[5:16] <vurtual> Let a guy avoid a coupe de grace by sheer will? Why not?
[5:16] <Miclee> I just use 3.5 rules as a base and modify them to what I want.
[5:17] <TecmagDiams> Never join in a dull moment <.<
[5:17] <TecmagDiams> Budda's comment was the first I saw....
[5:17] <Budda> awesome
[5:17] <vurtual> We're talking about D&D
[5:18] <TecmagDiams> Again
[5:18] <TecmagDiams> Sweet
[5:18] <vurtual> and about how rules aren't that important
[5:18] <TecmagDiams> Getting used to new OS....again...
[5:18] <Animator> How about having a penis that can shift size and act as a rope to strangle people?
[5:18] <vurtual> yep!
[5:18] <TecmagDiams> Last time I was here I was running Ubuntu, now it's Mint.
[5:18] <TecmagDiams> >.>
[5:18] <vurtual> Suddenly have a pokemon battle? Okay.
[5:18] <Miclee> rofl
[5:18] <Budda> wait, so I can have my scorpion? awesome
[5:18] <Animator> That sounds pretty damn fun, actually.
[5:18] <vurtual> Wild ODDISH appears!
[5:18] <vurtual> Or pokemon fighting with 3.5 combat rules
[5:18] <Miclee> What's fun is when you have a centaur and a dwarf both in your party.
[5:19] <vurtual> just don't let them go to -10
[5:19] <Miclee> The dwarf rides the centaur and you're an epic battle machine.
[5:19] <vurtual> dwarftuar: It's half dwarf, half pony.
[5:19] <Miclee> lol
[5:19] <Miclee> I should make one of those
[5:19] <vurtual> dwarf has the appearance of a mongol rider.
[5:19] <vurtual> has proficiency with all bows, and pulls locks of hair that grow back to form arrows.
[5:19] <Miclee> I want to make a polar centaur, though(Polar bear/centaur).
[5:20] <vurtual> Does it just have a half horse, half man, except the neck meets with a polar bear neck?
[5:20] <vurtual> brb drawing that
[5:20] <Miclee> Dunno, it's an odd thing.

[5:33] <TecmagDiams> I love it, totally worth buying.
[5:33] <Dezerus> Infdev Multiplayer?
[5:33] <vurtual> and a super-high sky to go with it
[5:33] <vurtual> also, monster spawns are fixed, so now combat doesn't suck!
[5:34] <Dezerus> Excellent. I'll buy it as soon as possible.
[5:35] <Dezerus> Any tips for Infdev, anything to look forward to?
[5:35] <vurtual> you can make a hobbit hole
[5:35] <vurtual> they're an awesome kind of home
[5:35] <vurtual> just find a big hill, dig a room, and add a double door lined with wood. Instant hobbit.

[5:45] <Cheeseyx> Ladders are useful
[5:45] <Visiiri> DID YOU KNOW
[5:45] <Dezerus> Why do ladders suck?
[5:45] <Visiiri> if you put ladders around a 1x1

[5:45] <Visiiri> like, around the square

[5:47] <Dezerus> Why was it dreaded again?
[5:48] <vurtual> spending ages just climbing down a ladder
[5:48] <Dezerus> Ah, right...
[5:48] <vurtual> sure, it got accross that the fire temple is really deep inside the volcano
[5:48] <TecmagDiams> (rats, didn't back up my infdev map)
[5:48] <vurtual> But couldn't have an elevator worked?
[5:48] <TecmagDiams> I hated that ladder

[5:56] <AndrewPH> vurtual, most advanced is a better term
[5:56] <vurtual> yeah I'm not the one making the cliam here
[5:56] <Dezerus> But I meant in terms of graphics and such. Advanced is what I'm looking for.
[5:56] <Dezerus> Thank you, Andrew.
[5:56] <vurtual> they make me throw up :(
[5:56] <vurtual> anyways back to something not runescape
[5:56] <Dezerus> Hey, if you can do better, by all means.
[5:57] <vurtual> I my polarbearcentaur is better than their graphical technology.
[5:57] <AndrewPH> vurtual, your polarbearcentaur isn't in java
[5:57] <vurtual> It will be if I replace MC paintings with it
[5:57] <AndrewPH> that's just a bunch of pixels derpdeprpe
[5:57] <vurtual> still better
[5:57] <AndrewPH> the painting may be
[5:57] <vurtual> anyways, can we please stop talking about something I was raped into playing?
[5:58] <AndrewPH> but the polarbearcentaur isn't coded in java
[5:58] <AndrewPH> it's coded in penisscript

[6:00] <Dezerus> These are actually good, though. They got rid of the crappy graphics.
[6:00] <vurtual> Mostly by at least partially force, by "people". I do not like "people" anymore.
[6:01] <Budda> rs graphics are still fairly bad
[6:01] <AndrewPH> Dezerus, btw don't bother having a srs discussion with vurtual
[6:01] <Dezerus> I was figuring that out myself, Andrew. By the way, what are your opinions on the graphics in that video?
[6:01] <Budda> if they cbf and made a stand-alone client, and implement proper downloading etc, they could up it all a fuckton
[6:02] <Dezerus> They do have a stand-alone client. They made a new one.
[6:02] <Budda> but they keep the graphics shit so 99999999999999999999 people can play
[6:02] <vurtual> is it IE still?
[6:02] <Dezerus> Nope.
[6:02] <Dezerus> Custom client.
[6:02] <AndrewPH> Dezerus, Haven't checked the video
[6:02] <vurtual> "here's our client! It's an IE launcher without the taskbar!"
[6:02] <Dezerus> Uses DirectX.
[6:02] <Dezerus> It's Open Source. I can give you the link.
[6:02] <Dezerus> It is NOT IE.

[6:03] <vurtual> I got yelled at for being able to notice the nipples.
[6:03] <Budda> i lol'd when they brought out dungeoneering, the weeks before they hyped it up saying 'no other game has ever had anything like what we are about to add!!!!' then they bought dungeoneering...
[6:03] <vurtual> Why, I do not know.
[6:03] <LuciferZ> At the request of Visiiri, we are making a fancy minecraft logo
[6:03] <Budda> its like 'what, you've never played ANY OTHER mmorpg ever?
[6:03] <Dezerus> http://www.runescape.com/downloads/runescape.msi?100604
[6:03] <Dezerus> That's the new client.
[6:03] <AndrewPH> Budda, there aren't many that DO have randomized dungeons
[6:04] <vurtual> runescape is a horrible, horrible thing, and you should be ashamed of it.
[6:04] <Dezerus> Okay. That's your opinion.
[6:04] <Budda> AndrewPH: the point is, it has been done before
[6:04] <Budda> many times
[6:04] <vurtual> No, it's what it is.
[6:04] <vurtual> Do you want fun? Get out of here! You're going to click on things, for 4xp!
[6:04] <Dezerus> Wow, you are ignorant.
[6:04] <vurtual> You reached level 92! You're halfway!
[6:04] <Budda> it takes thousands of hours in rs to get anyhere near max level
[6:05] <Dezerus> Something is telling me in the back of my mind that this Vurtual guy is a troll...
[6:05] <vurtual> Congradulations, you're a member! Here's more quests that are basically free quests, but with their own areas!
[6:05] <Dezerus> Okay. Tell me how that's any different than any number of other MMORPGs.
[6:05] <vurtual> Our few redeeming qualities are story-driven quests, and bothering to make a unique design for every item!
[6:05] <Dezerus> Once you figure that out, come back to me.

[6:07] <vurtual> Compared it to many other MMOs, of similar stature.

[6:07] <vurtual> age groups, community, game design.
[6:07] <Dezerus> Touche.
[6:08] <vurtual> runescape scored bad.
[6:08] <Budda> i too spent a long while playing rs
[6:08] <Budda> and then it got shit after the first level, and i scammed people out of accounts instead

[10:33] <Plinky> More or less
[10:34] <Plinky> Out of 147 or so people, there are 10-17 people who are intelligent
[10:34] <Visiiri> Why is purple a royal colour?
[10:34] <Visiiri> Because blue rarely occurs in nature.
[10:34] <Visiiri> Name one organic product that is blue.
[10:34] <Plinky> Some berries
[10:34] <Visiiri> Yes, blueberries and blackberries.
[10:34] <Visiiri> Others, of course.
[10:35] <Visiiri> But other than berries, there's very little.
[10:35] <Visiiri> (Blue corn is kinda brown-blue.)
[10:35] <Plinky> Some leaves during some seasons
[10:35] <Plinky> They turn a bluey purple.
[10:35] <Visiiri> Leaves don't count, however, as they would mold in a dye.
[10:35] <Plinky> Some fruits and veggies.
[10:35] <Visiiri> No veggies, no fruit.
[10:36] <Plinky> Berries are a fruit
[10:36] <Plinky> :P
[10:36] <Visiiri> Well, other than the forementioned berries.
[10:36] <Visiiri> And I think there's a blue potato.

[10:37] <Plinky> http://www.disabled-world.com/artman/publish/fruits-vegetables.shtml
[10:37] <Visiiri> As the objective IS purple, in the end.
[10:37] <Plinky> Not many, but there is a list on that page
[10:37] <Plinky> Eggplant is another
[10:38] <Plinky> Raisins
[10:38] <Visiiri> It's not about the amount, as I"m sure there's a lot.
[10:38] <Visiiri> However, these aren't things I've ever eaten (for the most part) and I don't believe they're abundant.
[10:38] <Plinky> Most of those don't seem extremely common though.
[10:38] <Plinky> Exactly.
[10:38] <Visiiri> Yeah.
[10:39] <Visiiri> Wearing purple -> I can afford grapes. Hah.
[10:39] <Liam> Um. How come i can't set "max-connections" in server.properties to a number larger than three?
[10:39] <Plinky> Other than fruits and veggies there is very little.

[10:41] <Plinky> It was made form a marine snail
[10:42] <Visiiri> Hmm
[10:42] <Plinky> So to answer your original question Visiiri, purple was a royal colour because it is rare.
[10:42] <Visiiri> some of those must be in Minecraft now.
[10:43] <Visiiri> I want purple clothes.
[10:43] <Visiiri> Big time.
[10:43] <Plinky> When Notch implements dyes, I think he should implement proper ways to get them, relating to how they were originally obtained.
[10:43] <Plinky> I want a purple hoodie.
[10:43] <Visiiri> That'd be really cool, actually.
[10:43] <Visiiri> (I wear purple shoes IRL.)
[10:43] <Liam> Srs. Why can't i set max-connectiosn to a number larger than three.
[10:43] <Liam> xD
[10:43] <Plinky> I where black irl.
[10:43] <Plinky> wear*
[10:44] <Visiiri> I would really like that idea, Plinky.
[10:44] <Liam> Are you two just ignoring me?
[10:44] <Plinky> Visiiri, being able to dye your clothe armour would be even better.
[10:44] <Liam> Probably
[10:44] <Liam> Everyone hates me.
[10:44] <Plinky> cloth*
[10:44] <Visiiri> Yeah
[10:45] <Plinky> Sorry Liam, not ignoring you, is it max connections per ip?
[10:45] <Visiiri> It'd be cool to be able to powder things and then just press q and drop it in water
[10:45] <Liam> yeah.
[10:45] <Visiiri> and in a few seconds, it becomes a dye
[10:45] <Plinky> You don't need any more than that Liam.
[10:45] <Liam> Well when i'm <material i can't discuss in #minecraft>, yes i do.
[10:46] <Plinky> Visiiri, agreed, maybe someone should suggest a dye system like that to notch?
[10:46] <Visiiri> I want buckets, too.
[10:46] <Plinky> That would only need to be suggested during beta though
[10:47] <Visiiri> Notch wont work on MP for a while.
[10:47] <Plinky> Suggest it after he implements buckets.
[10:47] <Visiiri> Yay, buckets
[10:47] <Visiiri> I want to be a tailor now :(
[10:47] <Plinky> Lol
[10:48] <Plinky> Being a tailor would be a good experience, you would need a lot of creativity.
[10:49] <Plinky> Also Visiiri, woad can be used to make purple dye.
[10:49] <Plinky> Tyrian purple to be specific.
[10:50] <Plinky> Only recently (12 years ago) an english engineer discovered the secrets behind the tyrian purple dye. Which is pretty cool.

[12:01] <Sparky20> the change to night in MC is a scary exprience.
[12:02] <Roadcrosser> in peaceful monsters should still appear
[12:02] <Roadcrosser> but not as scary
[12:02] <Roadcrosser> and when they touch YOU
[12:02] <Roadcrosser> they die
[12:02] <cardgame> lol
[12:03] <Roadcrosser> and still drop items
[12:03] <Roadcrosser> so spider jumps at you
[12:03] <Roadcrosser> he dies
[12:03] <Sparky20> lol
[12:04] <Sparky20> any tips on finding iron?
[12:04] <Sparky20> all I can find is coal in cliffs
[12:09] <Visiiri> dig straight down.
[12:09] <Visiiri> As deep as you can
[12:12] <Plinky> Visiiri that is a mean suggestion
[12:13] <Plinky> Just dig down in a diagonal line Sparky.
[12:13] <Sparky20> Tryed that.
[12:13] <Sparky20> didnt really find any.
[12:17] <Plinky> Look harder?
[12:19] <cardgame> I dug two 2x3 shafts
[12:19] <cardgame> horizontally
[12:20] <cardgame> through a hill
[12:20] <Visiiri> Normal trees are back in infdev...
[12:20] <cardgame> results: 50 iron ore
[12:20] <cardgame> out of like 300-400 stone
[12:20] <cardgame> found ALL OF THEM on the bottom right of my tunnels, for some reason
[12:21] <Visiiri> Most people dont' realize that Minecraft uses procedural generation.
[12:21] <Visiiri> Nobody has simply 'cracked' the pattern yet
[12:21] <Plinky> Visiiri, I wouldn't mind trying, but it would take a while.
[12:21] <cardgame> digging straight down in diag lines is bad way to do it
[12:21] <Visiiri> ^
[12:22] * glaxtar (Poopoopee@c-76-104-190-132.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:22] <Visiiri> If you find iron ore, dig horizontally
[12:23] <Plinky> If you find the ore then yes, if you are looking, dig diag then make "hallways" off it.
[12:23] <Plinky> Covers a lot of ground imo
[12:23] <Plinky> But then again, I don't exactly have the ability to test.
[12:23] <cardgame> not very easy to traverse diag mines
[12:23] <Visiiri> I mine with TNT...
[12:24] <cardgame> I made one that took 4 mins to get to the end
[12:24] <cardgame> still not much ores.
[12:24] <Visiiri> It's very efficient
[12:24] <cardgame> I bet lol
[12:24] <Visiiri> to do a 10x1 line
[12:24] <cardgame> I play on Peaceful so no TNT for me
[12:24] <Visiiri> with a perpendicular 10x1
[12:24] <Visiiri> and another one
[12:24] <Visiiri> so it makes a +
[12:24] <Visiiri> ...with another one, you know
[12:25] <Visiiri> That mines 1000 blocks in a few seconds
[12:25] <Visiiri> (easily)
[12:25] <Visiiri> I actually tried to tunnle through the biggest mountain I could find with just TNT
[12:25] <Plinky> That is clever Visiiri
[12:25] <Plinky> Record said explosion please?
[12:25] <Visiiri> Hehehe

[12:30] <Visiiri> Not a way to replicate
[12:31] <Visiiri> Just general average standards
[12:31] <Visiiri> Most Iron is found x far underground
[12:31] <Visiiri> would be a 'crack' to his sequencing, even though it's not nearly close.
[12:31] <Visiiri> Enemy mobs spawn in the dark.
[12:32] <Visiiri> That's a sure way to know where enemy mobs spawn
[12:33] <Visiiri> Ores, I'm sure, have a defined pattern
[12:33] <Visiiri> It's probably A LOT more advanced than that.

[14:12] <Speljohan_> they just want shit to be free
[14:12] <Speljohan_> populistic party
[14:12] <sppt> so voting for them is like not voting at all, or voting blank

[14:12] <Speljohan_> besides, if in theory they took over ur country sppt
[14:12] <sppt> i mean, it's a good issue which they're raising, but srsly, it's the only thing they talk about
[14:12] <Speljohan_> or even mine
[14:12] <Speljohan_> it would destroy the economy
[14:12] <Speljohan_> completely
[14:12] <Budda> wat issue

[14:13] <Budda> we have like 2 parties in nz that take up 90% of the seats
[14:13] <Speljohan_> luckily we have more serious parties that have a bigger chance of getting into government

[14:16] <Speljohan_> assimilate the ones currently in country
[14:16] <Budda> ours is limited =D
[14:16] <Speljohan_> then have strict rules for future

[14:28] <quaxar> I get death threats on youtube
[14:28] <sorre> somehow, some people don't understand why the former inhabitants of the land now known as israel would be angry about the way things turned out
[14:28] <quaxar> because I tell people to quit celebrating death
[14:28] <quaxar> and then they tell me they are going to stab me and see how I want to have armed guards around me
[14:28] <Speljohan_> yes yes, let's spend tax money on waging wars, let's ignore education and welfare
[14:28] <quaxar> or something paranoid scizophrenic like that
[14:29] <sorre> they're suggesting that they're not aggressing
[14:29] <quaxar> I just see people think security is just how much swords and arrows you have

[14:34] <quaxar> people get all depressed
[14:34] <quaxar> I don't think its depressing, its just a fact of reality of our surroundings
[14:34] <Speljohan_> people who hate muslims generally don't have a clue though
[14:34] <Speljohan_> "MEDIA SAID MUSLIMS R BAD THEN IT MUST BE TRUE"
[14:34] <quaxar> its not like hating people its just that "hey, we gotta get our shit together guys, or are we lazy stupids?"
[14:34] <quaxar> and they can only respond with anger to otherpeople about warming temperatures
[14:35] <quaxar> I really dont care who is to blame, just make it so we dont all suffer
[14:35] <quaxar> And blaming people is a waste of time
[14:35] <quaxar> "bah the arctic passage is open, im so angry!"

[14:37] <quaxar> "I HEAR HE HAD SEX WITH WOMEN!"
[14:37] <quaxar> *crowd gasps*
[14:38] <Speljohan_> yeah, sex scandals are ridiculous
[14:38] <quaxar> not all, but most
[14:38] <Speljohan_> the federal ones are fun read though
[14:38] <sorre> only the democrats have sex scandals with women
[14:38] <sorre> the republicans have scandals involving sex with MEN
[14:39] <quaxar> only after n sync existed
[14:39] <quaxar> (wich was created by a gay pedophile who worked at disney)
[14:39] <quaxar> no kidding
[14:39] <Speljohan_> one of my favourites
[14:39] <Speljohan_> "Iran-Contra Affair (1985?1986); A plan conceived by CIA head William Casey (R) and Oliver North (R) of the National Security Counsel to sell TOW missiles to Iran for the return of US hostages and then use part of the money received to fund Contra rebels trying to overthrow the left wing government of Nicaragua, which was in direct violation of Congress' Boland Amendment.[98] Ronald Reagan appeared on TV stating there was no "arms for hostages"
[14:39] <Speljohan_> deal, but was later forced to admit, also on TV, that yes, there indeed had been"
[14:40] <sorre> conspiracy theories are always 100% untrue, the media told me so
[14:40] <Budda> lol
[14:40] <quaxar> Calling them theories mean they are true though
[14:40] <quaxar> SCIENCE!
[14:40] <Speljohan_> except this was no conspiracy theory
[14:40] <sorre> yes, i know
[14:40] <sorre> it's conspiracy fact

[14:41] <sorre> watergate, the tuskeegee experiments, and mk-ultra were also conspiracy fact

[14:41] <Speljohan_> ya
[14:41] <quaxar> Like the conspiricy of patt tillman
[14:41] <quaxar> wich was that he was shot with american soldiers bullets
[14:42] <quaxar> and they at first said it was some iraqi soldiers working with americans
[14:42] <quaxar> And then 3 years later said "whoops, it was US solder ammunition"
[14:42] <Plinky> Is mcafee bad?
[14:42] <quaxar> yeah
[14:42] <sorre> but, if you tell someone that the US government has drugged people in an attempt to create a brainwashed supersoldier, they probably wouldn't believe you

[14:45] <quaxar> when she was 6
[14:45] <quaxar> because natives dont have rights
[14:45] <Speljohan_> not surprising
[14:45] <quaxar> That was before they forced her to learn english instead of her native language and be bilingual
[14:46] <quaxar> instead they beat the native language out of her
[14:46] <Speljohan_> bunch of imperalist scumbags
[14:46] <quaxar> My mom was the last native speaker of my indigenous language
[14:46] <sorre> similarly to my earlier statement, try telling someone that government scientists gave a bunch of black people a fake syphilis vaccine, just so they could study the people as syphilis destroyed their bodies and minds
[14:46] <sorre> they'll look at you like you're from fucking MARS
[14:46] <quaxar> Whenever I hear the english is the langauge of the USA laws
[14:46] <quaxar> I just think of whitey using that law

[14:49] <Speljohan_> <sorre> oh wait, that's right...
[14:49] <Speljohan_> good one
[14:49] <quaxar> Because to them athiesm is communism
[14:50] <quaxar> and communism is the only thing that kills people
[14:50] <Speljohan_> yeah
[14:50] <Speljohan_> and nazism
[14:50] <Speljohan_> communism and nazism
[14:50] <Speljohan_> !
[14:50] <Speljohan_> they are eviiiilllllL!!!
[14:50] <Marach> no u.
[14:50] <quaxar> yeah, I asked people what the #1 threat to humanity is that is a not human beleif based
[14:50] <Speljohan_> [/foxbroadcast]
[14:50] <quaxar> and they said athiest communism
[14:50] <quaxar> and I was like, uh
[14:50] <Speljohan_> rifk
[14:50] <quaxar> lol
[14:51] <Speljohan_> it's funny how they can indoctrinate the people so badly
[14:51] <Speljohan_> and get away with it
[14:51] <sorre> it's more funny that some people never notice how much bullshit it all is
[14:51] <Speljohan_> usa will probably find an excuse to attack south america soon
[14:51] <Speljohan_> seeing how they are uniting more and more
[14:51] <Speljohan_> and getting more and more left-wing all the time
[14:52] <sorre> and they always hated venezuela
[14:52] <Speljohan_> yep
[14:52] <Speljohan_> despite being an awesome country in every way thesedays!
[14:52] <Speljohan_> i mean, just look at what mr hugo chav?z accomplished in 10 years
[14:53] <Marach> brb, something mindless
[14:53] <Azathoth> we should just elect god to be president alreadty
[14:53] <Azathoth> already*
[14:53] <Speljohan_> we should just elect richard stallman
[14:53] <Speljohan_> !
[14:54] <Plinky> Or we could force all the head people in each country to form a council and unite the world? :D
[14:54] <quaxar> yeah
[14:54] <Plinky> It wouldn't work.
[14:54] <quaxar> I think autistics should run the government
[14:54] <Plinky> But it would be interesting.
[14:54] <Speljohan_> actually it is working Plinky
[14:54] <sorre> >implying richard stallman isn't even better at finding ENEMIES OF YOUR FREEDOM
[14:54] <Azathoth> i think computers should run the country
[14:54] <Speljohan_> but not in our favour
[14:54] <quaxar> Richard Stallman is so pro freedom that he would free everyone
[14:54] <Speljohan_> as in, a world government is inevitable
[14:55] <sorre> he would attempt to free everyone, whether they like it or not
[14:55] <Speljohan_> it's called totalitarianism and it will be the end of all freedom
[14:55] <Plinky> Speljohan_: Ofcourse it will happen in the end.
[14:55] <sorre> just like some of our presidents have done
[14:55] <quaxar> Well at least a real world government wouldent have random countries having veto power
[14:55] <quaxar> instead of the shitty one we have now
[14:55] <Azathoth> freedom is slavery
[14:55] <Speljohan_> buuut, it would become oppression of the people quaxar
[14:55] <Plinky> Won't end all freedom in the world.
[14:55] <quaxar> lol
[14:55] <Plinky> We will just have to become rebels.
[14:55] <quaxar> I only care for the end of freedom
[14:55] <quaxar> the end of the freedom to be ad ick
[14:55] <sorre> oh lord http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/washington-whispers/2010/06/08/cnbc-host-says-obama-sullied-office-with-ass-to-kick-line.html
[14:55] <quaxar> The end of the freedom to be fat
[14:55] <quaxar> I hate freedom!
[14:55] <sorre> and here i thought 'decency' complaints couldn't get any more retarded
[14:56] <Speljohan_> loll
[14:56] <Azathoth> omg
[14:56] <quaxar> I HATE BUTTS
[14:56] <Azathoth> president can't even say ass?
[14:56] <Speljohan_> pfft
[14:56] <Plinky> I wouldn't mind if all the governments of the world united and we started colonising other planets :D
[14:56] <Speljohan_> where did you read butt quaxar ?
[14:56] <Speljohan_> all i saw was a mule
[14:56] <quaxar> Speljohan_ I make fun of people afraid of bodily functions
[14:56] <Speljohan_> oh
[14:56] <quaxar> but everybody poops
[14:57] <quaxar> who fucking cares
[14:57] <quaxar> its not disgusting
[14:57] <Speljohan_> then you can make fun of this whole channel
[14:57] <Plinky> It is natural.
[14:57] <sorre> if all the governments of the world united, they'd better form a super robot
[14:57] <quaxar> I wont play with poop
[14:57] <Azathoth> it would be so cool if obama spoke like a real black person
[14:57] <Speljohan_> cus apparently nudity is dangerous to kids
[14:57] <Speljohan_> but violence isn't
[14:57] <quaxar> he should of said, cut off their head
[14:57] <quaxar> and spit down their throats
[14:57] <Azathoth> he'd be all like "YO ALL MY NIGGAS OF DA UNITED STATES. WUT UP"
[14:57] <quaxar> while drinking the blood of innocents
[14:57] <sorre> "Using the A word when you are on the Today Show talking with Matt Lauer, yeah, that disturbs me."
[14:57] <Plinky> Sex has a higher rating than some violence. Doesn't make much sense.
[14:57] <sorre> herp derp
[14:57] <quaxar> and he would of got less complaints than saying "ass butt
[14:57] <Speljohan_> sounds awesome uax
[14:58] <Speljohan_> quaxar*
[14:58] <quaxar> A persons aying ass butt would get less complaints than explaining how to murder people
[14:58] <quaxar> I mean more complaints
[14:58] <quaxar> bah
[14:58] <Speljohan_> ya
[14:58] <Plinky> OH NO
[14:58] <Speljohan_> cus that's the morals of usa you see
[14:58] <Plinky> HE SAID DONKEY
[14:58] <quaxar> Yah I did that on MMO's to annoy people
[14:58] <Speljohan_> it doesn't apply in sweden
[14:58] <Azathoth> i'd fucking give him a fist bump if he publically said fuck
[14:58] <quaxar> without violating the anti cussing filters
[14:58] <Speljohan_> we have old comedies from like the 70's with full frontal nudity
[14:58] <quaxar> I would just talk about dissecting people so they leave the area
[14:58] <Plinky> Fuck wasn't originally a swear word though.
[14:58] <quaxar> fuck is just what poor people say
[14:58] <Speljohan_> what pansies quaxar
[14:58] <Azathoth> america, the land of hypocrasy and contradiction
[14:58] <quaxar> thats why its wrong
[14:59] <Speljohan_> hypocrisy*
[14:59] <Azathoth> fuck you
[14:59] <quaxar> Fuck originated as a gaelic word "to hit hard"
[14:59] <Speljohan_> :D
[14:59] <quaxar> and people would fuck everything

[15:03] <Plinky> Yeah.
[15:03] <Plinky> Or To breed
[15:03] <sorre> but, like 'fag', words can only have one meaning in modern america
[15:03] <sppt> yes, royal family is stupid
[15:03] <sorre> wouldn't want to confuse the retards
[15:04] <quaxar> It was pretty much looked down on because of "its the poor people talk, nobles talk thike THIS"

[15:05] <quaxar> Im just illiterate
[15:05] <vurtual> Do take note, for thou are confuseth the speech of thy common peasantry, and the speech of thine extremely out of touch noble.
[15:06] <Plinky> Basically, it shouldn't be as offensive as it it is.
[15:06] <vurtual> peasants talk like this, maybe using "ye olde" on signs for things like taverns
[15:06] <Plinky> Ye olde 'eadless nick.
[15:06] <quaxar> peasents didnt know how to write
[15:06] <vurtual> which is pronounced "the old"
[15:06] <sorre> wasn't there a character called a 'thorne', that resembled 'y', but was pronounced 'th'?
[15:06] <quaxar> only rich people were allowed to, because peasents are not worthy
[15:06] <vurtual> Using the letter thorn, yeah.
[15:07] <Plinky> The letter thorn?
[15:07] <vurtual> and peasants could probably write and read fairly fine. Probably not good enough to spend their whole life reading to do everything, but it's not exactly a "forbidden art"
[15:07] <Plinky> I must see it.
[15:07] <vurtual> y
[15:07] <vurtual> there it is
[15:07] <vurtual> Hurry, catch it! It's gonna run away!

[15:10] <KodaichiZerp> hey got some time to kill before worl begins
[15:10] <Plinky> LOL
[15:10] <sppt> :??
[15:10] <sppt> gee, that looks stupid
[15:10] <Plinky> LOL
[15:10] <KodaichiZerp> haha, yea
[15:10] <Plinky> I love Thorns.
[15:11] <vurtual> They don't work on a flower though. They just look like... herpes, or something
[15:11] <vurtual> "Hey, I got you a rose! It has an STD!"
[15:11] <sppt> hm, the irc protocol doesnt allow unicode in nicknames right?
[15:11] <KodaichiZerp> so notch added doors; they are surprisingly simple imo.
[15:11] <Azathoth> it doesn't allow unicycles in nicknames
[15:11] <Azathoth> how are they surprisingly simple?
[15:11] <vurtual> It's a door
[15:11] <Budda> ?
[15:11] <sppt> i love doors in mc
[15:11] <Azathoth> they open.... i don't see how much more complex it gets
[15:11] <vurtual> They can open, and close. They swing.

[15:11] <sppt> you punch them to open it
[15:12] <Azathoth> you can also use right click
[15:12] <KodaichiZerp> i rpobably wouldn't have done it the same if i was him, and it wouldn't have been as good
[15:12] <Azathoth> which is the use key for everything
[15:12] <Plinky> I haven't seen doors yet.
[15:12] <sppt> yes but punching is more fun
[15:12] <vurtual> kick them open and slam them, like an action movie star.
[15:12] <sppt> exactly vurtual :D
[15:12] <Plinky> Speaking of which, I asked my dad if I could get premium. First one to guess his answer wins?
[15:12] <vurtual> What WOULD you have done, kodaichizerth?
[15:12] <KodaichiZerp> yeah its just that they aren't animated
[15:12] <vurtual> "how about no"
[15:12] <Plinky> Vurtual, yep
[15:13] <vurtual> how about you go get one o them preeeepaaaid cards
[15:13] <Plinky> But it was more like "No, the news is on, be quiet."
[15:13] <Budda> Plinky: "what the fuck is minecraft? is that some faggot game boy? go outside and play with the cars in the street!"
[15:13] <Plinky> I don't have a job.
[15:13] <Plinky> Yet.
[15:13] <vurtual> No, it's ANIME, it's FOREIGN.
[15:13] <Plinky> Don't actually have the time for a job sadly.
[15:13] <vurtual> translators note: "kawaii" means "cute"
[15:13] <KodaichiZerp> i like the instant doors better, just easier to work with
[15:13] <Plinky> I'm busy almost every day after school and I am meant to do homework on saturday and sunday.
[15:14] <vurtual> That is mean.

[16:08] <Takos360> xD
[16:08] <vurtual> Because the alternative is letting someone get beat up, and that is bad.
[16:08] <Takos360> you are bad :P
[16:09] <vurtual> You'd let someone just get beat up?
[16:09] <vurtual> and you'd just walk on by
[16:09] <Takos360> i dunno
[16:09] <Takos360> if its a criminal
[16:09] <Takos360> then maybe
[16:10] <vurtual> It's still wrong, man.
[16:10] <vurtual> Jail is one thing.
[16:10] <vurtual> But letting someone get beat up is a whole nother.
[16:10] <thechris> they were talking about letting people carry 1 gram of weed in Detroit o.O not sure if it passed tho
[16:10] <vurtual> What if it was a doctor?
[16:10] <Takos360> stopping violence with more violence only leads to well, more violence
[16:10] <vurtual> Rushing to the hospital, to deliver a baby?
[16:10] <Takos360> do it Ghandi style :D
[16:10] <vurtual> Yes, and in the end, Takos360, someone has won.
[16:10] <vurtual> Do you want them to win? Or you?
[16:11] <thechris> thats why we use gu--- i mean words
[16:11] <vurtual> It only leads to enough violence if you don't use the proper amount of violence.
[16:11] <Takos360> now your talking as someone trying to make a mob
[16:11] <vurtual> gunwords
[16:11] <vurtual> words almost unkown, but if spoken, are as powerful as a gun.

[16:15] <vurtual> Then you can be like "Hey, you there! Cop! What are you doing!? That's against the law!"
[16:15] <Codlike> Having the doors has gven me the motive to create a 'quick hatch' down one floor
[16:15] <TrueWolves> Well, the fact sign's main function works is grand
[16:16] <Drakkar> i think i remember protosigns that were just like
[16:16] <TrueWolves> I'm just saying that the ability to rotate was a nice surprise sub-feature
[16:16] <vurtual> "I said, that's against the law." *taps him on the shoulder, probably ignored* "LISTEN." *elbow to face*
[16:16] <Drakkar> masses of pixel fake words
[16:16] <Drakkar> and you'd look at it
[16:16] <Drakkar> and you'd get a floaty text box
[16:16] <vurtual> save the elbow to face when he's like, beating up someone though.
[16:16] <Drakkar> or something
[16:16] <TrueWolves> ... Was there ever proto-signs?
[16:16] <Drakkar> yeah
[16:16] <Drakkar> i think so
[16:16] <TrueWolves> I don't remember them.
[16:16] <Drakkar> i may be remembering the initial multiplayer test's chat
[16:16] <vurtual> what about old survival signs?
[16:16] <thechris> i hate games were the signs are just a bunch of pixels on the signs
[16:16] <TrueWolves> old survival signs were never added in saddly.
[16:17] <Takos360> its spelled where*

[17:27] <TrueWolves> Notch was none of these 19 people. =D
[17:27] <TrueWolves> XD
[17:27] <vurtual> He's like my girlfriend, I guess.
[17:27] <TrueWolves> He said, and I quote:
[17:27] <vurtual> except instead of work ethic, my girlfriend's stamina is in bed.
[17:27] <TrueWolves> It's pretty horrible.. But I'm fast, so I tell my self it evens out.
[17:27] <TrueWolves> I recently freaked out a bit and had to take a three week break after I had kept getting more and more delayed while working on multiplayer, telling myself I'd "catch up" soon. I guess the lesson here is to be open about my development, even when it's slow.

[19:37] <Ominus> i concur
[19:37] <TrueWolves> Accualy...
[19:37] <TrueWolves> About water physics...
[19:37] <TrueWolves> Notch said that's the hardest part for him in the code in the whole game, so he's really trying to think of a way to just get it working before daring to touch it again.

[19:39] <TrueWolves> the whole "spreads a few blocks" is a lot harder to code then it sounds.

[20:54] <SnowmanHTC> I have a dream.
[20:54] <vurtual> k
[20:54] <Malikat> there are no quick answers
[20:54] <NEIC112> Can I rune minecraft without a video card?
[20:54] <shairn> shoot
[20:54] <shairn> yes
[20:54] <SnowmanHTC> Nope.
[20:54] <shairn> it's just very slow
[20:54] * Saiko (saaaaiko@the-suites-4855-boulder.sites.intello.com) has joined #minecraft
[20:54] <NEIC112> Any idea how?
[20:54] <vurtual> no you'll have to letter it
[20:54] <shairn> I have a computer using only integrated graphics
[20:54] <Malikat> not unless you mean an onboard video card
[20:54] <vurtual> how would you not have a video card
[20:54] <shairn> and it functions
[20:54] <vurtual> it's the part that draws the screen
[20:54] <SnowmanHTC> It needs pixel shader afaik
[20:54] <vurtual> without it you could not physically see stuff
[20:54] <vurtual> it'd be like playing without a monitor
[20:54] <vurtual> but worse
[20:55] <Malikat> ^
[20:55] <SnowmanHTC> Integrated works
[20:55] <Malikat> so he could run a server
[20:55] <NEIC112> Yeah...
[20:55] <SnowmanHTC> Since it's bscly still a graphics card
[20:55] <NEIC112> But.. How? c.c
[20:55] <vurtual> you play the game
[20:55] <Malikat> NEIC112: if you have an integrated graphics card, you'll be okay
[20:55] <SnowmanHTC> Just a shitty one
[20:55] <NEIC112> I'm not sure I have.
[20:56] <SnowmanHTC> Open start
[20:56] <Malikat> if you have literally no graphics card, then you don't have any way to output video to the monitor
[20:56] <SnowmanHTC> Press run
[20:56] <SnowmanHTC> Type dxdiag
[20:56] <Malikat> SnowmanHTC
[20:56] <SnowmanHTC> Go to the display 1 tab
[20:56] <Malikat> he has a graphics card
[20:56] <Malikat> he is just a hardware noob
[20:56] <NEIC112> Yeah, I am.
[20:57] <NEIC112> Sec, while I do this.
[20:57] <Malikat> have you ah
[20:57] <Malikat> tried just running minecraft and seeing if it works?
[20:57] <shairn> :P
[20:57] * smn is now known as smn`off
[20:57] <NEIC112> Yeah, I get an error.
[20:57] <Malikat> which error
[20:58] <SnowmanHTC> What one?
[20:58] <NEIC112> I checked the forums and it's related to video card drivers
[20:58] <NEIC112> But I don't have a video card.
[20:58] <SnowmanHTC> Update them
[20:58] <Malikat> NEIC112: just because you don't have an actual video card in your system doesn't mean your motherboard doesn't have a video card integrated into it
[20:59] <SnowmanHTC> You don't have graphics card, but you do have a gpu
[20:59] <Malikat> if your motherboard didn't have a video card integrated into it, you would have no way of plugging in the monitor
[20:59] <SnowmanHTC> afk
[20:59] <NEIC112> Okay...
[20:59] <Malikat> therefore, you need to update the graphics drivers for your onboard video card

[21:03] <Plinky> Yes. And don't mine diamond with a pick that is about to break.
[21:03] <NEIC112> So... How can I make sure which intergrated graphics card do I have so I can update it's drivers?
[21:03] <shairn> why not
[21:03] <Plinky> Iron digs the second fastest
[21:04] <Plinky> Gold is the same "tier" as wood.
[21:04] <Malikat> NEIC112: snowman was going to have you use dxdiag to find what graphics card you have
[21:04] <Naxza> Gold is just fun to look at.
[21:04] <AcidMan> Oh
[21:04] <AcidMan> That sux
[21:04] <shairn> shinyyyy
[21:04] <AcidMan> xD
[21:05] <Dragoon> Did anyone else notice the door sound effect?
[21:05] <shairn> makes sense since there are no practical uses of gold at minecraft's level of technology
[21:05] <shairn> yeah

[21:05] <AcidMan> :C
[21:05] <AcidMan> Yeah
[21:05] <shairn> I can't find spiders even on hard
[21:05] <Malikat> NEIC112: do you have directx diagnostic tool running?
[21:05] <shairn> :c
[21:05] <AcidMan> Anyways guys thanks for teh help
[21:06] * AcidMan goes off to play some more infdev
[21:06] <Ten_Tacles> Where is it?
[21:06] <Sade> I found plenty waiting on top of my tunnel between two mountains
[21:06] <Sade> I walked outside and all of the sudden I was being shot at by around 4 skeletons
[21:06] <AcidMan> Oh and why isnt water flooding?
[21:06] <AcidMan> D:
[21:06] <shairn> used to get 10+ of em at the same time
[21:06] <Sade> Ouch. xD
[21:06] <shairn> disabled water phys
[21:06] <Naxza> I've found a number of spiders on my latest infdev file. No skeletons, but I really can't complain about that.
[21:06] <AcidMan> On indev
[21:06] * Cial (Cial@68.170.96.228) has joined #minecraft

[21:07] <vurtual> craft octopi
[21:07] <Malikat> drink it first
[21:07] <shairn> you could empty huge lakes
[21:07] <AcidMan> xD
[21:07] <vurtual> throw them at mobs
[21:07] <Malikat> let it mix naturally
[21:07] <AcidMan> I suppose

[21:10] <ClassiestMedic> hi
[21:10] <Naxza> Y'know, Infdev is a LOT more fun when you actually dedicate time to building an outdoors construction instead of making the perfect cave home.
[21:10] <ClassiestMedic> That's what I did
[21:10] <Naxza> With that, quarries are also kinda fun, now that we have ladders.
[21:10] <vurtual> I went very far away.
[21:10] <vurtual> and farther
[21:10] <ClassiestMedic> Made a little wood house nestled against the side of a cliff
[21:10] <Marach> infdev is too limited for me :/
[21:10] <vurtual> and farther
[21:11] <vurtual> and farther.
[21:11] <shairn> I made roads
[21:11] <ClassiestMedic> with a nearby lake right at the door
[21:11] <Naxza> Infdev is limited?
[21:11] <vurtual> I travelled two ingame days, made a camp each night.
[21:11] <shairn> with lit torches all over them
[21:11] <ClassiestMedic> :D
[21:11] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[21:11] <shairn> a lighthouse
[21:11] <Marach> yeah
[21:11] <shairn> a cottage on a hill
[21:11] <ClassiestMedic> :D
[21:11] <Quatroking> Notch should add this to Minecraft: http://4gifs.com/gallery/d/87096-4/Screw_tank.gif
[21:11] <Marach> there's like 3 times less blocks obtainable
[21:11] <shairn> an artificial island
[21:11] <Quatroking> It'd make the game so much better
[21:11] <vurtual> with a tall signal tower every two days.
[21:11] <vurtual> then I got killed
[21:12] <Naxza> Infdev has infinite blocks.
[21:12] <shairn> no
[21:12] <Quatroking> naxza, its not infinite
[21:12] <shairn> it has 8 times the surface of the earth
[21:12] <Malikat> screw tank is basically like SCREW THIS SCREW YOU SCREW EVERYTHING
[21:12] <shairn> literally
[21:12] <shairn> :P
[21:12] <Quatroking> once you exceed the 42 gazillion or something the client crashes
[21:12] <Naxza> For all frikkin' intents and purposes, it's infinite.
[21:12] <vurtual> x*8*128 m^3 blocks
[21:12] <vurtual> where x is the surface of the earth
[21:12] <Marach> Quatroking: it crashes? i thought the generatop fucks up

[21:14] <ClassiestMedic> heh
[21:14] <ClassiestMedic> I wonder how long it'd take to reach the end of the map in infdev
[21:14] <ClassiestMedic> and, if you ever attained that, what it would look like
[21:15] <vurtual> fractal knows the latter
[21:15] <ClassiestMedic> Someone should do that
[21:15] <vurtual> seek his thread
[21:15] <ClassiestMedic> oh?
[21:15] <ClassiestMedic> I'm on it
[21:16] <Naxza> Aye. Check the forums, there's a youtube video about the edge of the universe.
[21:16] <ClassiestMedic> wow
[21:16] <ClassiestMedic> I must search that

[21:18] <gear1> mmm
[21:18] <Ten_Tacles> Duh
[21:18] <gear1> i hope that ores become less distributed
[21:18] <Ten_Tacles> Why does the moon follow the sun?
[21:18] <ClassiestMedic> it was made damn recently, too
[21:18] <ClassiestMedic> after the door update
[21:18] <gear1> and more clumped
[21:18] <Ten_Tacles> Thats not real life like.
[21:18] <Malikat> because the sky is just projected on a huge dome
[21:19] <Naxza> Huh. So you can make about 73 ladders out of a stack of logs.
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> yeah it is
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> I used up the equivalent of about 400 ladders
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> I did a ladder every other block
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> and i still ran out :D
[21:19] <Naxza> Wait. Infdev's sky is 800 blocks high?
[21:20] <ClassiestMedic> no
[21:20] <ClassiestMedic> i went down, too
[21:20] <Malikat> Naxza: 65 ladders
[21:20] <Malikat> er
[21:20] <Malikat> 75*
[21:20] <gear1> lol
[21:20] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[21:20] <ClassiestMedic> There's a sea of lava under the map :D
[21:20] <gear1> you know what i'd like to see?
[21:20] <Naxza> (64 x 4 x 2 )/7
[21:20] <ClassiestMedic> I was like *mine mine mine mine mine* *SPLOOSH* *SIZZLE* *SUGGH*
[21:20] <gear1> instead of ores being evenly distributed everywhere
[21:21] <Malikat> which they're not
[21:21] <gear1> to have areas with large concentrations
[21:21] <Naxza> That's 73.14285714 ladders. =P
[21:21] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[21:21] <gear1> they are mostly evenly distributed
[21:21] <ClassiestMedic> use the infdev ore mapper
[21:21] <ClassiestMedic> lol naxzai used up a whole lot more than that
[21:21] <ClassiestMedic> i did
[21:21] <Malikat> 1 log = 1 ladder with 1 leftover pole
[21:21] <Naxza> I was just saying in a stack of logs.
[21:21] <Malikat> therefore 64 logs = 64 ladders, 64 poles
[21:21] <Adam01> Is there any other way to make fire without a lighter?
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> hnurr, my computer is lagggging
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> yes
[21:22] <Malikat> 64 poles = 9 ladders, 1 leftover
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> it's called NBTedit
[21:22] <Adam01> -_-
[21:22] <Adam01> infdev ...
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> chandge the dec number to 51
[21:22] <PyroPyro> indev...
[21:22] <Malikat> nbtedit works on infdev...
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> and voila
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> yeah it does
[21:22] <Malikat> ^
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> how do you think I built all those damn ladders?
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> magic?

[21:24] <Marach> i'm getting bored with firefox.
[21:24] <Naxza> Adding it to the stack on hand instead of having to put it in the inventory.

[21:37] <Madtoaster> You want to.
[21:37] <Naxza> YAY.
[21:37] <Madtoaster> MAKE DIAMOND ARMOR NOAW
[21:37] <outsomnia> i want diamond
[21:37] <Mosslander> found dimond in infdev?
[21:37] <AcidMan> Why mad
[21:37] <Madtoaster> Its good
[21:37] <Mosslander> Diamond sword is best.
[21:37] * outsomnia is now known as outsomnia|
[21:37] <Naxza> Fifteen of them.
[21:38] <Naxza> On Infdev, yeah.
[21:38] <outsomnia|> dowant
[21:38] <Naxza> First time, though.
[21:38] <outsomnia|> did you find it while digging downwards or into cliffs?
[21:38] <AcidMan> Does diamond run out?
[21:38] <Mosslander> Yesh. I have a hard finding a reasonable amount of iron. I don't think I've found gold or diamond in infdev.
[21:38] <AcidMan> Like after you've crafted a sword for instance
[21:39] <Mosslander> Yeah it wears down.
[21:39] <AcidMan> But after a shit load of killing I'm guessing
[21:39] <AcidMan> ?
[21:39] <shairn> 128 blocks IIRC
[21:39] <Mosslander> but diamond sword kills in two hits, rather then the three of iron.
[21:39] <shairn> or 128 hits on enemies
[21:39] <Madtoaster> Acid, I killed 200 odd sheep with the diamond sword.
[21:39] <vurtual> a webcomic with only 117 comics
[21:39] <vurtual> howboutthat
[21:39] <Madtoaster> Its quite resistant.
[21:39] <AcidMan> Awesome
[21:40] <Madtoaster> Anyone here played Hydorah?
[21:40] <Naxza> Nope. Whuzzat?
[21:40] <Madtoaster> Cool Free game.
[21:40] <Madtoaster> FREE
[21:40] <Madtoaster> FREEEEEE
[21:40] <TkTech> Mosslander: strip mine a 40-50 block long area 6 deep (after dirt)
[21:40] <vurtual> no
[21:40] <vurtual> go away
[21:40] <Madtoaster> Its like, a side scroller.
[21:40] <shairn> well that says a lot
[21:40] <TkTech> Mosslander: Almost guaranteed to find some iron (or at least coal)
[21:40] <Madtoaster> 80's style.
[21:40] <Madtoaster> FUN.
[21:40] <Madtoaster> HARD*
[21:40] <Naxza> I actually found sixteen diamonds, but I think I lost when when my pick broke on it.
[21:40] <Madtoaster> But thats why it its fun.
[21:40] <Naxza> lose one*

[21:43] <shairn> I fell in it not long after finding my first diamonds
[21:43] <shairn> all 14 of them
[21:43] <Madtoaster> Hey, Mosslander.
[21:44] <Madtoaster> I heard you shower NAKED.
[21:44] <shairn> it was the happiest 5 seconds of my life
[21:44] <shairn> before being utterly crushed by the pain of losing all those diamonds :
[21:44] <Madtoaster> Ok, I shouldnt try to trick people on the internet.
[21:44] <shairn> :c
[21:44] <Madtoaster> It doesnt work.
[21:44] <shairn> mine craft life*

[21:45] <Mosslander> It you can take the land from the monsters, and start a farm, the land is yours.

[21:46] <Madtoaster> There needs to be some way of stopping monsters spawing.
[21:46] <Madtoaster> Save safe ones*
[21:46] <Madtoaster> Like, If you kill enough enemies in one place, they stop spawinging.
[21:46] <Madtoaster> For a while*
[21:46] <Mosslander> Like them not spawning on certain floor-types.
[21:46] <Madtoaster> Then, at the edges, they start spawing again,
[21:46] <Madtoaster> And if you dont kill them, they spread.
[21:46] <Madtoaster> Its like, you make a fort. Its invincible.
[21:46] <Madtoaster> You make another one,
[21:46] <Madtoaster> Live there for 2 ingame weeks.;
[21:47] <Mosslander> Floor-types would be less code and processor intensive...
[21:47] <Madtoaster> Then comeback,
[21:47] <Madtoaster> And its got enemies there.
[21:47] <Madtoaster> Good point.
[21:47] <vurtual> Madtoaster, you need to make longer sentences.
[21:47] <vurtual> Consciously think about it.
[21:47] <Mosslander> Good idea on the whole, though.
[21:47] <Madtoaster> I know, It has been said.
[21:47] <Madtoaster> Maybe, with tiles instead, and you have to keep in a limited range, or a timer starts up.
[21:47] <Madtoaster> If the timer runs out, the tile dies.
[21:47] <vurtual> How about mobs travel?
[21:48] <Madtoaster> No, that may be too PC intensive.
[21:48] <vurtual> no it would not
[21:48] <vurtual> they quickly travel wherever an infdev map isn't modified.
[21:48] <vurtual> so unless you maintain a barricade around somewhere, mobs will be rampant.
[21:48] <vurtual> great wall of china to hold off mobol hordes.
[21:49] <Mosslander> Nah. just tile types that friendly mobs don't spawn on. Like wood glass and processed stone or somethign.
[21:49] <vurtual> no, my idea is cool :(
[21:49] <vurtual> You could build WALLS to keep out most mobs.
[21:49] <Madtoaster> It is.

[22:19] <ZaxKellens> It's a myth
[22:19] <Marach> ?
[22:19] <Mosslander> With the amount of time it takes to find ore in infdev (since there are no caverns), it seems like I should just look for surface ore.
[22:19] <ZaxKellens> The Mythbusters checked it out, and it's true, no females on the interwebz
[22:19] <Snowman> Just because they don't talk to you doesn't mean they don't exist
[22:19] <ZaxKellens> Mosslander : Agreed, but I get lucky with my ore
[22:19] <Marach> yay, minecraft crashewd
[22:20] <ZaxKellens> Snowman : It's a joke, so many people get all anal about that joke o.o
[22:20] <Quatroking> Does anyone have a few nice design ideas for a vent?
[22:20] <Mosslander> Of all the things that could be implemented in infdev, I want caverns the most.
[22:20] <Snowman> Fucking jokes, how do they work?
[22:20] <ZaxKellens> I don't care about caverns myself
[22:20] <ZaxKellens> So blah

[23:11] <Marach> do trees have a separate underground?
[23:11] <Marach> that doesn't make sense
[23:11] <vurtual> yes, but going back for trees
[23:12] <vurtual> would be basically going back for wood
[23:12] <rob`> trees only need 6 vertical blocks, and a torch right next to the sapling
[23:12] <rob`> at least, new-style trees
[23:12] <bildramer> well
[23:12] <vurtual> the point of action that madden would be drawing around is constantly moving
[23:12] <Malikat> rob`: i prefer to put the trees on a block and add a torch on that block
[23:12] <bildramer> my solution would work
[23:12] <vurtual> this annoys madden

[23:15] <vurtual> nobody wants to watch me dig an endless thin tunnel, do they?
[23:15] <bildramer> yay
[23:15] <TkTech> rob`: Or new types of trees (like one that grows apples)
[23:15] <rob`> tk - yeah, there are certainly better things to do
[23:15] <rob`> I'm just saying, it'd be neat, not that he should do it RIGHT NOW

[23:40] <Malikat> ZomBuster had the balls to write a program that renders and aerial view of your entire infdev map
[23:40] <Visiiri> Isn't a cartogram a map where the landmasses are distorted due to statistics?
[23:40] <aporetic> whoa. :o
[23:40] <ZaxKellens> As I said though, is the cartographer link fixed now?
[23:40] <Malikat> an aerial*
[23:40] <ZomBuster> cartographing is map making
[23:40] <Malikat> there's a working mirror

[23:47] <Visiiri> but /tp and /say are
[23:47] <rob`> also it's /banip, not /ipban
[23:47] <rob`> i think
[23:47] <Icenisse> /broadcast is the same as /say
[23:47] <gdude2002> ohk
[23:47] <Visiiri> You're right.
[23:47] <Visiiri> I've not been on a vanilla server in ages
[23:47] <gdude2002> me to

[23:48] <gdude2002> wonder if I kept the maps
[23:48] <gdude2002> hmm
[23:48] <Dankirk> + it seems i can use /tp on invisible ops aswell
[23:48] <Icenisse> yeah
[23:48] <Naxza> What's different on custom servers?
[23:48] <Icenisse> its funni
[23:49] <gdude2002> Naxza: A lot.
[23:49] <gdude2002> :P
[23:49] <Marach> omg custom servers ban
[23:49] <Marach> Naxza: almost always, nophysics
[23:49] <gdude2002> Adam01's server can ban by hostname
[23:49] <gdude2002> lol
[23:49] <Naxza> I never was much into creative multiplayer.
[23:49] <Marach> me neither
[23:49] <gdude2002> I was
[23:49] <gdude2002> :D
[23:49] <Marach> i prefer building alone
[23:49] <Naxza> Multiplayer survival is another story, though.
[23:49] <Naxza> XD
[23:49] <gdude2002> Adam still has some of our old maps, acutally
[23:49] <Naxza> Can't wait for it.
[23:49] <Adam01> (not yet) But its soon to be implemented
[23:49] <Marach> survival is even worse :/
[23:50] <gdude2002> anyway brb
[23:50] <Marach> maybe multiplayer will fix it.
[23:50] <Icenisse> FalleMs server can ban and in the same time ban all ips in your hometown so you just cant get a new ip
[23:50] <Icenisse> >.3
[23:51] <vurtual> hmmm
[23:51] <vurtual> Why can i only place righthand doors?
[23:51] <Icenisse> uh
[23:51] <Ten_Tacles> Because you cam'tz place them.
[23:51] <Ten_Tacles> But everyone else can.
[23:51] <Icenisse> cause it would be hard to make so you get what you want
[23:51] <gdude2002> back
[23:51] <Zaneo> Icenisse that wouldn't always work
[23:51] <ZomBuster> try placing them at an angle
[23:51] <Icenisse> hmm
[23:51] <vurtual> doors can normally mirror themselves, right?
[23:51] <gdude2002> Adam01: Up for some css?
[23:51] <Icenisse> yeah
[23:52] <Adam01> Hmm
[23:52] <Adam01> After I install knome
[23:52] <Zaneo> some people have are in ip pools that are 2^24 large
[23:52] <vurtual> no matter WHERE or HOW I place them
[23:52] <vurtual> they're always right hand.
[23:52] <Adam01> (it uninstalled itself)
[23:52] <gdude2002> mk
[23:52] <Zaneo> you can't ban that lol
[23:52] <Adam01> *gnome
[23:52] <vurtual> even if there's no criteria to be mirrored, or just in the middle of nowhere
[23:52] <Icenisse> question;
[23:52] <vurtual> it's always right hand
[23:52] <Icenisse> vurtual
[23:52] <Icenisse> are you left handed?
[23:52] <vurtual> yes
[23:52] <gdude2002> alright
[23:52] <vurtual> doubledoors are impossible
[23:52] <Icenisse> hmm
[23:53] <ZomBuster> double doors are easy
[23:53] <vurtual> okay, placed it funny
[23:53] <Ten_Tacles> I can't wait for the moon to go down....
[23:53] <vurtual> and now it works
[23:53] <vurtual> it wouldn't let me
[23:53] <Icenisse> look
[23:53] <Icenisse> its easy
[23:53] <Icenisse> place it from the other waty
[23:53] <gdude2002> WDDW
[23:53] <Icenisse> way*
[23:53] <gdude2002> Wall door door wall
[23:53] <vurtual> I had to place it on the tile I was on
[23:53] <Malikat> TkTech: i delete it pretty regularly, but i load from backups
[23:53] <vurtual> gdude2002, doing that would result in two righthand doors
[23:53] <vurtual> I have no idea why.
[23:53] <gdude2002> hmm
[23:53] <Icenisse> uh
[23:53] <Icenisse> you dont have to

[23:53] <gdude2002> then
[23:54] <Icenisse> so it opens out
