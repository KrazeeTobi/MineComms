[0:08] <bearz> i can't wait to build my own secret agenda which is going to steal everyones stuff and go hide somewhere
[0:08] <Plinky> Bearz, my secret agenda is the best.
[0:08] <Plinky> I plan to cause minecraft world war 1...
[0:09] <Plinky> oh crap.
[0:09] <Plinky> In all seriousness, that is my public agenda :D
[0:09] <TrueWolves> I plan to use TNT cannons to seige custom servers that use a land-claim flag system.
[0:09] <Plinky> TW. I plan on supporting you.
[0:09] <Plinky> If you agree with SHA or SPA though.
[0:10] <bearz> i hope that notch builds some kind of a "masking" system what doesn't show your name to other people >:I
[0:10] <TrueWolves> SHA? SPA?
[0:10] <Plinky> Slime Hunting Association
[0:11] <TrueWolves> bearz, it never do that for greifer related reasons.
[0:11] <Plinky> Slime Protection Agency
[0:11] * TrueWolves doesn't join clan deals >.>
[0:11] <bearz> 1-3 man clans are wawesome
[0:11] <bearz> they work the best
[0:11] <Plinky> These are secondary clans.
[0:11] * Draco12 (Draco@dsl-trebrasgw1-fea5fa00-179.dhcp.inet.fi) has joined #minecraft
[0:11] <Plinky> Not a primary clan.

[0:12] <Cat> Plinky also that logo i made says MineChan
[0:12] <Cat> ;P
[0:12] <Plinky> So they are more like groups or a bunch of people/clans with similar viewpoints.
[0:12] <Plinky> I know Cat.
[0:12] * Draco12 (Draco@dsl-trebrasgw1-fea5fa00-179.dhcp.inet.fi) has left #minecraft
[0:12] <Plinky> So it is advertising minechan, minechan is good fun though.

[0:14] <bearz> >:I
[0:14] <Shadaez> clans are stupid
[0:14] <RavenBurga> Read
[0:14] <Plinky> My groups are people with different points of view on slimes.
[0:14] <TrueWolves> The thing about TNT cannons is that they don't work effecently (4~5 TNT for 1 explosion) but they are CANNONS, they have range, range that may bypass the range of a land claim flag.

[0:16] <bearz> >:I
[0:16] <bearz> and few main places
[0:16] <RavenBurga> H/m members?
[0:16] * TheCameraWorks has played minecraft for a Year 2 months and 12 hours D:
[0:16] <bearz> me and friend
[0:16] <bearz> and other friend
[0:16] <Plinky> TrueWolves, join a group of likeminded individuals then?
[0:16] <bearz> three people actually
[0:16] <RavenBurga> I has 2 member
[0:16] * tophus (tophus@115-64-128-226.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[0:16] <RavenBurga> :D
[0:17] <TrueWolves> I'd rather not care for titles
[0:17] <TheCameraWorks> Dr Who = insane?
[0:17] <TrueWolves> I just want to have fun. ^.^
[0:17] <sorre> me and a few real-life friends are likely going to coordinate our activities
[0:17] <Plinky> You don't need titles
[0:17] <sorre> but i wouldn't call it a 'clan'
[0:17] <Plinky> Clans are more than attachments
[0:17] * TrueWolves is a mimamilist.
[0:17] <TrueWolves> I'll have friends, but I won't attach my self to a clan, I perfer to be neutral.
[0:17] * vede has played Minecraft for six years and is going to start a clan called "The Nonclansmen"
[0:17] <Plinky> They are a bunch of people that want to follow some goal, you will get no where being a loner in SMP.
[0:17] <Plinky> :D
[0:17] <Cat> http://fragmer.net/minechan/banners/banner9.gif
[0:18] <TrueWolves> vede, you've only played a few days longer then me. X3
[0:18] <Cat> cant stop loving that banner.
[0:18] <TrueWolves> Who says I'll be a loner?
[0:18] <vede> Only requirement to join The Nonclansmen is to never join any clan.
[0:18] <TrueWolves> This is the biggest reason I won't join a clan, to prove you don't need to be in one just to work with others.
[0:18] <vede> Even The Nonclansmen. You have to not join it to be in it.
[0:18] * evaldusia (nnscript@lan70-973.elekta.lt) has joined #minecraft
[0:18] <Cat> i SMP i will lead my fellow cats to vicory.

[0:20] * Link2006 (alloatous2@modemcable242.204-21-96.mc.videotron.ca) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:20] <Plinky> No.
[0:20] <RavenBurga> In smp I will steal stuff and mess with peoples mind
[0:20] <Plinky> But a clan allows for a lagre number of people to achieve one goal.
[0:21] * SumWon (someonerul@99-189-118-70.lightspeed.snmtca.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:21] <bearz> everybody thinks that there will be like 1000 people servers and stuff
[0:21] <bearz> i hink .(
[0:21] <bearz> but i think that every server will be 2-10 players only ;o
[0:21] * RavenBurga (Trolol@CPE-124-190-25-219.obcz1.win.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Quit: RavenBurga)
[0:21] <sorre> correction
[0:21] <sorre> 2-10 at a time
[0:22] * CyanRyan (ColourCyan@c-69-244-188-76.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Nope.)
[0:22] <sorre> there's a big difference here
[0:22] <bearz> yes
[0:22] <bearz> it's quite hard to build some kind of a ABUN LCAN ww1 stuff in 10 player server s:d
[0:22] <Plinky> TheOne's and WoM will probably have quite large servers.
[0:23] * RavenBurga (Trolol@CPE-124-190-25-219.obcz1.win.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[0:23] <bearz> yeah maybe
[0:23] <RavenBurga> Buuut seriously please go post on this topic
[0:23] <bearz> but they suck.. ;(
[0:23] <RavenBurga> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=20271
[0:23] <Plinky> No they don't.
[0:23] <TrueWolves> 64 person servers will be possible in 2 years, that number will double every 2.5 yearsish
[0:23] <bearz> i prefer private server with friends
[0:23] <Plinky> I'm an op on TO's lava and build :P
[0:24] <Darkfire002> !seenlast ez
[0:24] <Cat> im a cat
[0:24] <bearz> it will have about 6-12 players
[0:24] <RavenBurga> GO THERE
[0:24] <Plinky> TrueWolves: It could be fast depending on how the code is implemented.
[0:24] <RavenBurga> Ich bin ravenburga
[0:24] <TrueWolves> Plinky, I'm looking at it from a RAM limit.
[0:25] <Cat> http://fragmer.net/minechan/m/src/127913205393.png
[0:25] <Cat> :3
[0:25] <Plinky> True, but the amount of ram per player isn't high, just the map generation and which chunks are active at once, non?
[0:25] <RavenBurga> How.
[0:25] <Cat> >custom servers
[0:25] <Cat> ;)
[0:25] <RavenBurga> Tell me.
[0:25] <Plinky> Even more true Cat.
[0:26] <TrueWolves> According to notch, it's about 64 RAM per player if everyone is in a diffrent spot at once.
[0:26] <Plinky> Who did that Cat?
[0:26] <TrueWolves> So I follow a 32 people per 3 gig's of RAM worst case senario deal.
[0:26] <Plinky> Reduced if they are in the same chunk, like a clan mining op might be in.
[0:26] * crom_cruach (Mibbit@86.17.86.223) has joined #minecraft
[0:26] <Plinky> Now, servers generally have a large amount of ram
[0:26] <TrueWolves> with 12 gigs of RAM, you could hold up to 128 people if your willing to be very slightly risky.
[0:26] <Plinky> Making more players possible.
[0:26] <crom_cruach> hey so who bought the creeper shirt?
[0:26] * RavenBurga (Trolol@CPE-124-190-25-219.obcz1.win.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:27] <TrueWolves> The biggest problem is memory leakage, there will always be a tiny bit.
[0:27] <sorre> also, what about the possibility of a network hack?
[0:27] <TrueWolves> So I'll cut that number in half.
[0:27] <sorre> multiple servers working together to connect players to the same world?
[0:27] <bearz> im gonna makes millions of tnt's and put them everywhere
[0:27] <TrueWolves> 12 gigs of RAM = 64 people safely.
[0:27] * Kizzycocoa (kizzycocoa@78.150.83.0) has joined #minecraft
[0:27] * Kitoari (luke@75-13-90-135.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:27] <Plinky> True. But Notch will fix stuff like that ASAP, will he not?
[0:27] <Cat> sorre thats not simple
[0:27] <TrueWolves> sure, you can easily hold more then that (particurarly if people stick togeather) but 64 is a good safe limit.
[0:28] <Cat> and probbably too buggy
[0:28] <sorre> no, it's not simple
[0:28] <sorre> but who knows what people are going to come up with?
[0:28] * HoJoey (HoJoey@p5B075C75.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:28] <Cat> servers wuld need to exchange alot of data
[0:28] <Plinky> Sorre, people will probably try that on the release of multiplayer.
[0:28] <TheCameraWorks> ?
[0:28] <Cat> so its not possible
[0:28] <HoJoey> hi again
[0:28] <TrueWolves> 20 gigs of RAM you could have a 200 person server and holycrap would that be awesome.
[0:28] * Kitoari (luke@75-13-90-135.lightspeed.austtx.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:28] <Plinky> Cat, servers don't need to be a long distance a part.
[0:28] <HoJoey> in singleplayer, is it possible to give my character some additional iron?
[0:28] <Cat> :/
[0:29] <sorre> yeah, they could be right next to each other
[0:29] * crom_cruach (Mibbit@86.17.86.223) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:29] <Plinky> Could be right next to each other.
[0:29] <sorre> in which case, it may be possible
[0:29] <Plinky> Like EVE onlines servers.
[0:29] <TrueWolves> HoJoey, you can cheat with InvEdit.
[0:29] <Cat> oh you mean local
[0:29] <HoJoey> thx
[0:29] * Blackthorn (Blackthorn@bas1-kitchener06-1096647827.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Quit: sleep)
[0:30] <Plinky> Someone will probably try a two server setup at one stage, but who knows.
[0:30] <Plinky> Could always devote a server to the players and another to
[0:30] <bearz> yeah that might be true
[0:30] <Plinky> Wait scrap that.
[0:30] <Cat> i jsut wish notch updates creative ;_;
[0:30] <bearz> if someone makes custom server software which runs in.. three or four comnputer
[0:30] <TrueWolves> Cat, he's making InvCreative later.
[0:30] * iKJames (james@cblmdm72-241-129-156.buckeyecom.net) Quit (Quit: iCraft my Life. http://hlmc.net/)
[0:30] <TrueWolves> err
[0:30] <TrueWolves> inf*
[0:30] <bearz> \o/
[0:30] <TrueWolves> InfCreative (for payed users only)
[0:30] <Plinky> TrueWolves: In that case, a server with 200 people would be possible.
[0:30] <bearz> and that will be only premium players?
[0:31] <bearz> yeaaah
[0:31] <nannal_> by paid you mean pro
[0:31] <Cat> TrueWolves classic creative will be for paid only :/
[0:31] <TrueWolves> classic creative will always be free
[0:31] * Evicous (chatzilla@c-69-244-48-242.hsd1.az.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.6.8/20100722155716])
[0:31] <TrueWolves> notch said so.
[0:31] <Plinky> By paid he means premiun nannal_.
[0:31] <nannal_> also meaning pro
[0:31] <nannal_> as in we premium members are pro
[0:32] <TrueWolves> ... eh
[0:32] <Cat> TrueWolves nop he sad it will not be free
[0:32] <nannal_> to the chatlogs?
[0:32] <Cat> thats why he alowed custom servers
[0:32] <TrueWolves> I've met some awesome free users and some crapy premium members, I don't want to find the corlation between 'pro' and 'paid'
[0:32] <Rooster> It's a definite fact, if you bought it, your better.
[0:32] <Plinky> TrueWolves: I might talk to some people about the idea of using multiple nodes and stuff like that.
[0:32] * Rooster sarcastic me.
[0:32] <TrueWolves> He said all further updates won't be free, which is why he doesn't care for custom servers on classic creative becuase he's not updating it anymore.
[0:33] <Cat> well tbh
[0:33] <Rooster> Anyway, guess where I went?
[0:33] <Kitoari> he's openly making features to aid smp custom servers too
[0:33] <Rooster> JOHNNY RAMONE TRIBUTE.
[0:33] <Kitoari> which is nice
[0:33] <Cat> i know people that have hacks that crash creative
[0:33] <Rooster> FUCK YEAH
[0:33] <Cat> even on custom servers
[0:33] <TrueWolves> Classic Creative isn't getting any more updates (though he's making creative for the full game that takes advantage of inf maps)
[0:33] <Cat> so updates are needed
[0:33] <Cat> inf maps in creative?
[0:33] <Cat> tottaly usles
[0:33] <Kitoari> cat: have you emailed him?
[0:34] <Cat> he probbably knows
[0:34] <Cat> stuff like MCtunnel
[0:34] <Cat> and other hacks
[0:34] <Cat> that kill server software
[0:34] <Cat> i tested like 4-5 tools
[0:34] <Cat> all work good
[0:34] * Chris220 (Chris@cpc3-farn7-2-0-cust104.know.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:35] <TrueWolves> You'll have to talk to Notch about that, he doesn't sound intrested working on the old creative software currently.
[0:35] * Twangy (Roger@dsl-124-150-102-114.vic.westnet.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[0:35] <TrueWolves> So you'll proubly have to wait for him to release the source code, but he won't do that for a few years.
[0:35] <Cat> so we creative palyers are screwd?
[0:35] <Cat> ;_;
[0:35] <Cat> well nvm

[2:24] <Traviskolber> Even when you saw Johnson die? ;(
[2:24] <Phil> good job cat
[2:24] <Shrub> Johnson ;-;
[2:24] <Shrub> Johnson was the best
[2:24] <Shrub> but no the gameplay is really happy
[2:24] <Traviskolber> Oh.
[2:24] <arkides> I never played halo past the first game.
[2:24] <Traviskolber> The gameplay itself?
[2:24] <Traviskolber> Sure.
[2:24] <Shrub> Yeah.
[2:24] <arkides> I played a little of 2 and it got stale.
[2:24] <Traviskolber> Not very gorey, etc.
[2:24] <Shrub> gore has nothing to do with it
[2:25] <Traviskolber> But the story, if you actually do a bit of research, isn't very happy.
[2:25] <arkides> hey guys, do you know what game is happy?
[2:25] <arkides> minecraft!
[2:25] <Shrub> Team Fortress 2 is somewhat gorey, but that's damn happy
[2:25] <Traviskolber> Uh, sure, Arkides...
[2:25] <Slam> what the hell Cat dont link me to such filth ever again
[2:25] <arkides> TF2 is comical gore though
[2:25] <Shrub> The story is very happy
[2:25] <Shrub> in halo
[2:25] <Traviskolber> Yea, but TF2 has no story and is all about comedy XD
[2:25] <Shrub> because the good guys win
[2:25] <Traviskolber> You have giant Russian men with mini-guns running around killing people while saying "Sandvich".
[2:25] <ChJees> Cat, wtf
[2:25] <Shrub> also the final scene of GoW2 made me cry in win
[2:26] <Shrub> man I fuckin' love TF2
[2:26] <Traviskolber> You first call the games gay, then you say you love shooters? o.o
[2:26] <Traviskolber> You confuse me.
[2:26] <Traviskolber> Mind = blown.
[2:26] <Shrub> I never said I love shooters
[2:26] <TrueWolves> Traviskolber, they made a story for it... they made a short comic called "loose canon" and it's just as awesome as the game dispite being very short.

[2:26] <Shrub> But I do.
[2:26] <Traviskolber> TrueWolves, make look into that, then.
[2:26] <arkides> I don't consider GoW and Halo to be on the same line as most shooters.
[2:26] <Shrub> And I was only joking about them being gay
[2:27] <Shrub> but I find them overrated
[2:27] <Traviskolber> Arkides, why?
[2:27] <arkides> GoW and Halo to me are just games people played because they didn't know how to use computers at the time.
[2:27] <Shrub> They're rather fun

[2:28] <Shrub> and MW2 is fun
[2:28] <lifeless> MW2 MP has just pissed me off now lol
[2:28] <Traviskolber> But I like other shooters as well.
[2:28] <BATLORD> eh
[2:28] <Shrub> I loved CoD2
[2:28] <BATLORD> I don't want to play STRAWBERRY JELLY: THE GAME

[2:29] <Traviskolber> Just saying, I'm not one of the fanboys that follows one series or only the 'big three'.
[2:29] <BATLORD> halo 1
[2:29] <lifeless> time to carry on with my bridge in minecraft
[2:29] <arkides> goldeneye started FPSes on console

[2:29] <Shrub> 97 i think
[2:29] <Traviskolber> Mm.
[2:29] <Shrub> or was it 95
[2:29] <arkides> hell no
[2:29] <Traviskolber> Fine.
[2:29] <BATLORD> 1997
[2:29] <arkides> 96 is when the 64 came out
[2:29] <Shrub> yeah 97
[2:29] <Shrub> Man the 64 was late O.o
[2:30] <Shrub> but god GE was so pro
[2:30] <arkides> has anyone here actually gotten into the invite only multiplayer?
[2:30] <Shrub> It was so simple

[2:31] <BATLORD> Goldeneye
[2:31] <arkides> !
[2:31] <Traviskolber> xD
[2:31] <Shrub> N64 had the best games of all time :D
[2:31] <BATLORD> both of their LoZ's
[2:31] <Traviskolber> A beta inside an alpha.
[2:31] <Shrub> Banjo, Donkey Kong
[2:31] <Shrub> SM64
[2:31] <arkides> god.
[2:31] <BATLORD> Doom 64
[2:31] <Traviskolber> I can't say I care much for old games.
[2:31] <arkides> I LOVED ocarina of time so much
[2:31] <Shrub> Doom 64 <3
[2:31] <BATLORD> yeah
[2:31] <Shrub> also Travis go away you're not part of this
[2:31] <Traviskolber> The only one I can think of that I really loved is Red Alert 2.
[2:31] <BATLORD> best doom ever
[2:31] <arkides> old doom is better but god damn doom 64 was an amazing tribute
[2:31] <Shrub> Ocarina ;-;
[2:31] <Shrub> That game was so...
[2:31] <BATLORD> DUAL BLADE CHAINSAW FTW
[2:31] <Shrub> fantastic
[2:32] <Bodie> best game soundtrack... the monkey island series
[2:32] <Shrub> spectacular?
[2:32] <BATLORD> MM > OOT
[2:32] <Bodie> or quake
[2:32] <BATLORD> imo
[2:32] <arkides> I'm looking forward to the 3DS remake

[2:32] <DatOneGuy> Does obsidian have a use?
[2:32] <BATLORD> walls

[2:33] <BATLORD> MM was more immersive
[2:33] <BATLORD> I think
[2:33] <Traviskolber> Shitstorm...
[2:33] <BATLORD> and it had a better story
[2:33] <arkides> MM had a better plot
[2:33] <arkides> I agree

[2:41] <arkides> and spending a period of days with a few people clearing dirt trees and stones to just have this huge sealed city
[2:41] <arkides> and assign people jobs, sort of an RP kind of thing
[2:41] <bleak> i made an igloo in the snow level ^-^

[2:42] <TrueWolves> hide a city in a mountain dwarf styled.

It's not as detailed as I would have liked, the inner walls are mostly dirt, but I didn't know if my initial idea would even work so I didn't want to put all that time into it. Oh well, I guess I can always redo it in some other location.

[2:52] <epaGamer> no
[2:52] <arkides> but it's a little more complicated with infdev
[2:52] <epaGamer> i have saves from single player in indev
[2:52] <epaGamer> im talking about indev not infdeb
[2:52] <epaGamer> infdev*
[2:52] <epaGamer> ahhh sry
[2:52] <Traviskolber> Why does anyone play indev?
[2:52] <epaGamer> didnt read you all
[2:52] <epaGamer> im just curious
[2:52] <Traviskolber> Just download the damn client and play to stop confusion.
[2:52] <arkides> I like indev a little more sometimes
[2:52] <epaGamer> online saving works in single player but not in indev
[2:53] <epaGamer> it have cool level generator

[2:54] <epaGamer> im talking about SP for free users
[2:54] <Plinky> Vede
[2:54] <epaGamer> i mean creative mode
[2:54] <TrueWolves> That's creative.
[2:54] <Traviskolber> Imo, everyone should just download the damn client from the front page and play it.
[2:54] <arkides> OH
[2:54] <arkides> I'm sorry.
[2:54] <Traviskolber> That solves EVERYTHING.
[2:54] <vede> epaGamer, you can't just say "SP" and expect people to be able to read your mind.

[2:54] <petern> huh.. infdev saves are not online
[2:55] <Traviskolber> Petern, wakey wakey, we are talking about classic, not infdev.

[2:55] * TrueWolves wonders how long it take him to partly BS a 1600 word essay...

[2:58] <Traviskolber> Not enjoyable.
[2:58] <TrueWolves> This is an overnight thing.
[2:58] <Traviskolber> Just stating a VERY strange fact.
[2:58] <Traviskolber> So is ours x.x
[2:58] <TrueWolves> ... huh
[2:58] <Plinky> Traviskolber: How older are you?
[2:58] <TrueWolves> That's odd.
[2:58] <Traviskolber> Our teacher is the old style.
[2:58] <Traviskolber> He thinks we spend 24/7 on homework and shit.

[2:59] <TrueWolves> Yeaa- that's already proven not to work >.>
[2:59] <Plinky> Becuase in my grade 9, (around the age of 15) we have a max limit of 2500 words on essays
[2:59] <Plinky> old*
[2:59] <Traviskolber> o.o
[2:59] * Pelum|Sleep is now known as Pelum
[2:59] <TrueWolves> want to hear a funny story I don't advice you doing?
[2:59] <Traviskolber> I'm 13, (14 when I reach 8th grade, which is in Sep.) and we are expected to write 2500 words.
[2:59] <Pelum> evening minecraftians
[2:59] <Plinky> This is because otherwise we write over 4000 words.

[2:59] <Traviskolber> :)
[3:00] <Willox> Itd be so funny
[3:00] <Cat> MC needs cats
[3:00] <Traviskolber> It'd be so annoying.
[3:00] <Cat> and wulfs
[3:00] <Plinky> We had to do student directed inquiries and most of the essay writers tried to write well over the limit.
[3:00] <Traviskolber> Cat, YES.
[3:00] <Willox> My lovely saef ba- i built it into a volcano
[3:00] <TrueWolves> alright, nevermind then.
[3:00] <OpalMist> Willox: Volcanoes...yes. Yes. Yes.
[3:00] <Traviskolber> TrueWolves, I have great advice for you.
[3:00] <Traviskolber> Stop talking on IRC, it'll make the essay take half the time :D
[3:00] <Traviskolber> xD
[3:01] <TrueWolves> I already have it half written. =P
[3:01] <TrueWolves> It's not hard yo.
[3:01] <Traviskolber> So just BS the second part.
[3:01] <Willox> Maybe they wont erupt, they will just have lava in them
[3:01] <Traviskolber> "DA ECOEMYZ IS DA SHIZ YO"
[3:01] <Willox> thats sounds fair enough
[3:01] <Traviskolber> Over and over until you reach 1600 words.
[3:01] <Traviskolber> :D
[3:01] <Willox> Oh look at all that lava *tear* Ohshi a big
[3:01] <Willox> nuuuuuuuu
[3:01] <TrueWolves> I went throught my whole 11th grade not doing a single bit of homework in a class that was 80% homework
[3:01] <TrueWolves> I passed with a B
[3:01] <TrueWolves> guess how.
[3:01] <TrueWolves> 11th grade english class*
[3:02] <Traviskolber> Tests.
[3:02] <Traviskolber> :D
[3:02] <TrueWolves> But the tests were only 20%
[3:02] <Traviskolber> Hmm.
[3:02] <Traviskolber> Sucking up to the teacher?
[3:02] <TrueWolves> Nope.
[3:02] <Plinky> How?
[3:02] <Plinky> Being sick?
[3:02] <Willox> Drawing a frog?
[3:02] <Traviskolber> I give up.
[3:02] <Traviskolber> Tell us.
[3:03] <Traviskolber> I want to know how to do this, so I can stop doing my science homework x.x
[3:03] <Traviskolber> *Poke* TrueWolves?
[3:03] <TrueWolves> I didn't do the work, but proved I was learning. when my teacher realised I was accualy learning everything being tought rather then picking it up for a test and forgetting it (1 page required notes for each test, I didn't take notes, the requirement was dropped for me. XD)
[3:03] <DatOneGuy> Wow
[3:03] <DatOneGuy> Making a floating fortress is SUPER easy with a boat if you want it over water :)
[3:04] <TrueWolves> My teacher yelled at me a ton at the end of the class at the end of the year.
[3:04] <Traviskolber> So...
[3:04] <Traviskolber> You proved you were learning.
[3:04] <TrueWolves> then offered me an assignment to apply everything I learned to 2 books, huckleberry finn and moby dick.
[3:04] <Traviskolber> And you got a B
[3:04] <TrueWolves> Isn't school naught but to learn?
[3:04] <Traviskolber> Ah...
[3:04] <Traviskolber> Random question.
[3:04] <Traviskolber> Are you 'gifted'?
[3:04] <TrueWolves> the essay on both books was only 400 words a peice.
[3:04] <TrueWolves> gifted? Are you paying attention to my spelling?
[3:04] <Traviskolber> ROFL, you lucky bastard.
[3:05] <Traviskolber> Your spelling is fine.
[3:05] <Plinky> Exactly.
[3:05] <Plinky> He isn't gifted.
[3:05] <Plinky> Well
[3:05] <TrueWolves> I'll send you the essays, they were short, beacuse they contained no filler.
[3:05] <Plinky> 'gifted'
[3:05] <Traviskolber> What? So if you have spelling that is fine, you aren't gifted?
[3:05] <TrueWolves> The trick is that your memory can be improved if it's used.
[3:05] <TrueWolves> What you got to do is make use of your memory, make things fun.

[3:06] <TrueWolves> By giving an effort to remember what you read and write, you make implant what you are doing in your memory.
[3:06] <TrueWolves> You learn. =D
[3:06] <Plinky> TrueWolves: true.
[3:07] <Traviskolber> Do you?
[3:07] <TrueWolves> my teacher only wanted the essays so she was sure that I truely was learning and not just cheating or something.
[3:07] <Traviskolber> Well, it worked out well, TrueWolves.
[3:07] <TrueWolves> I proved to her I learned everything she was teaching, so she gave me a B, an A wouldn't be fair for those who did all the menial work just trying to pass a class after all.
[3:07] <Traviskolber> Plinky, you didn't answer my question.

[3:08] <Traviskolber> Proving he may be gifted.

[3:09] * ecrider is now known as ecrider|away
[3:09] <Plinky> OpalMist: Did it end up meaning they are fools?
[3:09] <TrueWolves> The tip is, try to prove to your teacher something with the essays, perhaps offer 2 essays, a really nice 3000 word one, and another one that's a lot smaller that cuts to the facts but is still easy on the eyes.
[3:10] <Pelum> i knew an autistic person once, i lost at the casino so i took him back. I think he was broken
[3:10] <Traviskolber> I didn't boast, Opal, I just used a fact to shove it may be possible that TrueWolves is gifted.

[3:27] <Plinky> You don't have to tell them that it is important.
[3:27] <Traviskolber> But even if you aren't paranoid, people will work harder under judgement.
[3:28] <Plinky> Should we measure intelligence by a test which is in worse conditions than my idea, or something that is just being judged.
[3:28] <Traviskolber> Did I say the test was good?
[3:28] <Plinky> Or even, if you do it at a young age, most won't worry about the judgement.
[3:29] <Traviskolber> But then you have to factor in brain development because of puberty, etc.
[3:29] <Sgt_C_Alpha> Its very hard to measure intelligence - even IQ tests dont give you an accurate picture.
[3:29] <Plinky> Children learn faster.
[3:29] <Traviskolber> But they aren't fully developed.
[3:29] <Plinky> However, they are also very creative.
[3:30] <Traviskolber> They learn faster because their head is empty (Not literally, of course).
[3:30] <Traviskolber> That, and I have another theory.

[3:34] <Traviskolber> Except creepers.
[3:34] <pontusedberg> it sprays fire!

[3:36] <Traviskolber> Oh yes, slimes too.
[3:36] <Plinky> Although cows, pigs and sheep do not attack.
[3:36] <Kizzycocoa> oh, 8 then
[3:36] <Traviskolber> Cows, pigs, and sheep are neutral.
[3:36] <Plinky> And slimes just want a hug.

[3:49] <Diablodoct0r> Cause I'm gonna implement my Livestream, but the page ain't wide enough.
[3:49] <SumWon> Oh cool
[3:49] <Diablodoct0r> Livestream video windows is too large
[3:50] <Diablodoct0r> So I have to make the borders of the images wider and shit
[3:50] <SumWon> It needs to be customizable..
[3:50] <Diablodoct0r> Yeah, it does
[3:50] <Diablodoct0r> But once you're above 500 pixels in width, all objects are resized
[3:50] <Diablodoct0r> Instead of the page itself
[3:50] <Plinky> Trolling people on facebook is funny
[3:50] <Diablodoct0r> And the video can't, so it cuts through the borders

[4:02] <quaxar> sorre you confuse things that factually happened with opinions
[4:02] <quaxar> like, I pooped today
[4:02] <merculiv> mp is in testing mode last I heard and isnt finished until support is done
[4:02] <Sgt_C_Alpha> i think it would be awesome if there was one mega server
[4:02] <muddtusk> waaaat?
[4:03] <Sgt_C_Alpha> and chat depended on which area you were in
[4:03] <TotempaaltJ> Sgt_C_Alpha: Yes. Someone should hire a supercomputer and set up a humongous server.
[4:03] <Sgt_C_Alpha> yes. yes they should.
[4:03] <quaxar> "I cannot take your statement of pooping today as a factual statement unless it is signed and notorized by the proper authorities, but then again, who am I to trust the notarizers?"
[4:03] <merculiv> clustering servers would be nice
[4:04] <quaxar> yeah we need to replace folding at home with minecraft server at home
[4:04] <rafasr> why not make a creeper siege? just for fun? :D
[4:04] <Sgt_C_Alpha> well if admins+ can spawn mob armies
[4:04] <nannal_> because .. oh god that would be awesome
[4:04] <Sgt_C_Alpha> that could be possible
[4:04] <sorre> well, i don't think it's necessarily a problem for the opinions of certain groups to be chronicled alongside the facts of the matter
[4:04] <Quatroking> what the hell
[4:04] <Quatroking> now the BP guys is quitting
[4:04] <Quatroking> and he's receiving 14 million euros
[4:04] <Raws> As in the CEO?
[4:05] <quaxar> he is "quitting" as a billionaire
[4:05] <TotempaaltJ> sorre: what are you TALKING about?
[4:05] <Quatroking> Raws, yes
[4:05] <quaxar> "farewell work, now pay me!"
[4:05] <Raws> welp
[4:05] <merculiv> p2p server action would be more appropriate
[4:05] <sorre> perspective is important
[4:05] <Sgt_C_Alpha> "I have to admit ive done terribly. Have 14 million euros!"
[4:05] <sorre> as long as it's obvious that it's someone's perspective, i see little problem
[4:05] <TotempaaltJ> And then, the megaserver should, obviously, have infinite terrain.
[4:05] <Sgt_C_Alpha> yes
[4:05] <sorre> also, provided that the perspective does not replace the facts of the matter
[4:06] <TotempaaltJ> Or at least so that the size of the terrain is only limited by the memory of the server.
[4:06] <Sgt_C_Alpha> and maybe multiworld
[4:06] <Pilk> Gee I'd hate to retire on a guaranteed 14 million euros
[4:06] <quaxar> yes, but thats whats happening

[4:06] <TotempaaltJ> With a lot of islands. And everyone spawing on a different island.
[4:06] <quaxar> aparently, but he will probably just work for a sister company or something
[4:06] <Sgt_C_Alpha> also id like to see an all ocean one
[4:06] <Shrub> hahaha
[4:06] <Shrub> BP
[4:06] <TotempaaltJ> *spawning
[4:07] <Sgt_C_Alpha> where everyone starts with a full invetory of dirt
[4:07] <quaxar> I took a picture of my local bp station
[4:07] <Sgt_C_Alpha> some tree
[4:07] <Sgt_C_Alpha> s
[4:07] <Sgt_C_Alpha> etc.
[4:07] <Shrub> An all ocean one would rock
[4:07] <Shrub> but with a couple small islands
[4:07] <Sgt_C_Alpha> dead far apart
[4:07] <Shrub> so you could have tiny settlements
[4:07] <Shrub> and sail for a day
[4:07] <Sgt_C_Alpha> or build your own islands
[4:07] <TotempaaltJ> Notch said he's going to make the server programmable, right?
[4:07] <Shrub> and trade and diplomacy
[4:07] <TotempaaltJ> So we could make mods for it.
[4:07] <Raws> Quatroking: wait, where did you hear about the final decision on Hayward?
[4:07] <Sgt_C_Alpha> well, thats going to be there anyway
[4:07] <Helar> this game is too scary D:

[4:08] <Sgt_C_Alpha> imagine this game on release date XD
[4:08] <TotempaaltJ> Let's spam his mailbox with Cluster Server mails :P
[4:08] <sorre> would explain his lack of empathy

[5:07] <Fiskie> Problem is
[5:07] <Fiskie> Slimes only spawn deep underground
[5:07] <Sgt_C_Alpha> nuuke the ground!
[5:08] <Fiskie> I had to close off my road to the underground because they kept jumping out from there :(
[5:08] <DatOneGuy> I'll have a floating air fortress
[5:08] <DatOneGuy> And cannons EVERYWHERE
[5:08] <DatOneGuy> Every hour I strike the earth
[5:08] <Plinky> Do you strike it by firing TNT into it?

[5:16] <RavenBurga> Lol
[5:16] <RavenBurga> Why?
[5:17] <Kizzycocoa> notch is testing MP again. he won't hand out invites, but that won't stop them
[5:17] <Rawer> i have Minecraft blocks on my Garry's Mod server
[5:17] <Sgt_C_Alpha> raven i dont think you can advertise clans here

[5:18] <RavenBurga> In relation to smp
[5:18] <DatOneGuy> Advertising clans pointlessly is stupid :/

[5:19] <Plinky> Anyone in SHA or SPA gets a gold star and a rank up if they raid and loot RotA's hq in minecraft.
[5:19] <DatOneGuy> Griefing is causing pain to others for the sole reason of doing it.
[5:20] <DatOneGuy> If you're actually attacking someone (however you go about it) for a reason, it's not griefing
[5:20] <RavenBurga> Lol plummy
[5:20] <Sgt_C_Alpha> :D
[5:20] <RavenBurga> Plinky*
[5:20] <DatOneGuy> That looks fun as hell Rawer xD
[5:20] <DatOneGuy> but I don't have Garry's Mod :/
[5:20] <DatOneGuy> Plinky, I'll get on that :P
[5:20] <Plinky> RavenBurga: It wasn't a joke.
[5:20] <Rawer> It's cool
[5:20] <DatOneGuy> Raven tell me what server you join when you start
[5:20] <RavenBurga> Why :(
[5:20] <RavenBurga> Ok syure
[5:21] <Rawer> but it's hard to build, it isn't that exact as Minecraft haha
[5:21] <Plinky> Because, I want the SPA to summon slimes and the SHA to coat your base in slime balls.
[5:21] <DatOneGuy> Yeah but the zombie looks hilarious
[5:21] <DatOneGuy> Pigs everywhere
[5:21] <Plinky> Or atleast replace all the diamond with slime balls.
[5:21] <Rjmint> Hay Guys Has Anyone Seen That Notch Hasnt Posted in 2 days :(

[5:22] <ColdFusion> Does notch has a normal job ?

[5:25] <Plinky> You said you would tell us the server.
[5:25] <Rjmint> i want to take the pig skin and delete it and put in the slime :P
[5:25] <DatOneGuy> All that matters is knowing what server you're on
[5:25] <DatOneGuy> The rest is trivial

[6:20] <Fiskie> And I'm sure flooding someones base with water/lava is griefing
[6:20] <DatOneGuy> Griefing is hurting someone for the sole reason of enjoying their suffering.
[6:20] <Onflol> I know that you dont have to do hax for greifing. But there exists no such thing in SMP
[6:20] <DatOneGuy> Whether it be breaking someones virtual wall or killing their puppy
[6:21] <Willox> :D
[6:21] <TheCactusman> Would destroying someones base in SMP be griefing, or part of the game?
[6:21] <Fiskie> Onflol: you don't even know yet
[6:21] <Malarkey> i want to play through the legacy of kain series again but i've sold them all except for soul reaver :(

[6:21] <DatOneGuy> Spend more than one summer on /v/ and you might learn some terminology
[6:21] <Fiskie> I'll be pleased if wom makes hax for smp
[6:21] <RavenBurga> Wom*
[6:22] <RavenBurga> Why.
[6:22] <DatOneGuy> Hacks for SMP would be fun, sure
[6:22] <Onflol> Oh for fucks sake, i dont want to be banned for being a swashbuckling adventurer. If you dont like that its possible to get killed then play by yourself on peacful mode.
[6:22] <RavenBurga> Not really
[6:22] <Fiskie> Crying 12 year olds, crying 12 year olds everywhere
[6:22] <ColdFusion> there is a serside anti-cheat now. Notch has checks for "Placing block to far away from player/going true blocks/flying/going faster then normal walk speed"
[6:22] <DatOneGuy> Onflol : We're not crying about griefers

[6:22] <DatOneGuy> We're saying that you're stupid and don't know what the term means
[6:23] <Fiskie> I always get into trouble
[6:23] <DatOneGuy> Who's paranoid about griefers and trolls?
[6:23] <TheCactusman> If the server says "No destroying other peoples stuff, no killing, Build stuff only" then it's griefing, but what is the point of not playing the game normally? Building stuff only belongs in Classic mode, not SMP.
[6:23] <Fiskie> The reason I leave some communities is because I get b& a lot lol
[6:24] <Naxza> You and Fiskie, looks like.
[6:24] <Sgt_C_Busy> cactusman yeah but if its against the rules you're going to get banned

[6:25] <DDRJake> you can't rely on server rules
[6:25] <Onflol> Oh for fucks sake, you cant read. Do i have to spell out everything? What i said was that doing anything possible ingame, to cause harm to other, for personal gain and not for amusement is not greifing, thats winning, according to game theory. Though cheating to get 120 pieces of tnt or making a obsidian spawn cage is.
[6:25] <DDRJake> you need options
[6:25] <TheCactusman> What is the point of building only in SMP? Why not go to creative mode? Notch is making a SMP creative mode with unlimited blocks. Why not build there?
[6:25] <Fiskie> "What i said was that doing anything possible ingame, to cause harm to other, for personal gain and not for amusement is not greifing"

[6:26] <Fiskie> You have -no idea- what griefing is
[6:26] <Cypher100> Griefing is fun
[6:26] <Onflol> Its not greifing if you stole/bought/made the tnt

[6:27] <Sgt_C_Busy> people who own the game though are less likely to grief
[6:27] <TnTfag> SSSSSSSSSSSSS
[6:27] <Cypher100> It would be cool if you could play as a creeper XD
[6:27] <Onflol> Yeah, maybe through magic
[6:27] <Sgt_C_Busy> kinda short though :P
[6:27] <TheCactusman> What is the point of having a server for building only on SMP?

[6:28] <DatOneGuy> Turn someone into a creeper
[6:28] <DatOneGuy> >Instantly regret decision
[6:28] <Sgt_C_Busy> then have your skin as a terrorist
[6:28] <TheCactusman> That's like having a Team Fortress 2 server with no killing.
[6:28] <Sgt_C_Busy> :P
[6:28] <WolfY> Saddle on a creeper, sorted
[6:28] <DatOneGuy> There is no point TheCactusman
[6:28] <Naxza> I know I'm not going to be the only one who's going to get into a bit of trouble in SMP. Doesn't mean I'm lolgrieftrolololl.
[6:28] <Fiskie> Notch better add customizable server variables
[6:28] <Onflol> AfuckGREEE
[6:28] <Sgt_C_Busy> saddle on a creeper would blow it up instantly
[6:28] <TheCactusman> Exactly.
[6:28] <Fiskie> So we can just have every man for theirselves servers
[6:28] <DatOneGuy> No one here is whining about griefing
[6:28] <Fiskie> No land flags or anything
[6:28] <Fiskie> Just proper play
[6:28] <DatOneGuy> Who the hell is in here saying no fighting?
[6:28] <DatOneGuy> Or rather I should say
[6:28] <Mithril> Notch better release SMP soon

[6:43] <TheCactusman> He's kicked then.

[6:43] <Skyl3lazer> get
[6:43] <SireTRM> And that code requires Notch to have a server up. . . So don't worry.

[6:44] <Quatroking> twitter: Facinus: @Quatroking Wow you're a huge faggot
[6:44] <ColdFusion> Quatroking has no humor but i think we all allready knew that
[6:44] <Stealez> Quatro isn't a total douchebag.
[6:44] <revenant> I never said that D:
[6:44] <Quatroking> I'm going to reply with "yeh"
[6:44] <revenant> He's just... Quatro.
[6:44] <revenant> You know what I mean.
[6:44] <vede> xRDVx, it's impossible because for anyone but the person who placed the boat, the boat doesn't exist.
[6:44] <Quatroking> okay I just replied with "lol k"
[6:44] <xRDVx> vede: oohh
[6:44] <Stealez> and he is somewhat humorous
[6:44] <vede> The boat-rider just glides along on top of the water.
[6:44] <Ominus> LOL
[6:44] <xRDVx> That'd be fun!
[6:44] <WolfY> Quatroking , little less SMP related, are powered minecart tracks going to be ready for SMP release?
[6:44] * xRDVx glides along on top of water
[6:44] <revenant> Has anyone else tried riding a pig across ice?
[6:45] <Sgt_C_Busy> no
[6:45] <revenant> It's... surprisingly fast.
[6:45] <Quatroking> WolfY, I don't know for sure, but I'm assuming so
[6:45] <Sgt_C_Busy> :P
[6:45] <WolfY> Yays
[6:45] <Stealez> yay.
[6:45] <WolfY> Yeh pigs zoooom on ice
[6:45] <Quatroking> Notch already got boats working, so powered carts should be easy
[6:45] <sorre> is there any content in the closed SMP test that isn't in the alpha at the moment?
[6:45] <Stealez> wolfy
[6:45] * Sgt_C_Busy is now known as Sgt_C_Alpha
[6:45] <Stealez> that didnt work for me:(
[6:45] <Quatroking> sorre: multiplayer
[6:45] <Fiskie> Oh it would be fun to hijack someone's minecraft track and route it into a pit of lava
[6:45] <sorre> besides that, duh

[6:45] <Sgt_C_Alpha> fiskie i think theyd notice and get out
[6:46] <Sgt_C_Alpha> :P
[6:46] <Quatroking> also, SMP has beachball compatibility
[6:46] <vede> sorre, no. But around 60% of the features in alpha at the moment are almost completely broken or nonexistent in SMP.
[6:46] <Fiskie> Sgt_C_Alpha: you can be sneaky about it
[6:46] <Nekogirl> just pour a bucket of lava infront of them
[6:46] <Fiskie> Say it's through a tunnel
[6:46] <Stealez> PvP isnt implanted yet
[6:46] <revenant> Minecraft needs Soliton radar.
[6:46] <Sgt_C_Alpha> ah

[6:50] <Quatroking> including paypal and shit, he pays about 70% tax
[6:50] <merculiv> better yet multiplayer/beta

[7:05] <Stealez> Camera?
[7:05] <janger> well if you take the amount of games that are brought and devide it by how many days there are you get the average per day
[7:05] <Stealez> What would two SD cards do?
[7:06] <Shrub> Be awesome.
[7:06] <Quatroking> I don't want to use adapters
[7:06] <Naxza> Right, bac.
[7:06] <Stealez> janger

[7:06] <Stealez> Why quatro
[7:06] <xRDVx> 70% is too much <.<
[7:06] <Stealez> 70% tax is bad

[7:07] <Stealez> just sayin
[7:07] <Quatroking> 70% tax is overkill, but I figure 10% goes to the server

[7:31] <sorre> leave torches
[7:32] <Shrub> ouch quattyt
[7:32] <xRDVx> MAKE SIGN TOWERS!
[7:32] <Shrub> Light beams would be cool
[7:32] <Genemos> If I've encountered a bug, can I submit the save file to Notch somehow?
[7:32] <hassifa> build a tower into the sky
[7:32] <Shrub> well guys
[7:32] <Shrub> goodnight
[7:32] <sorre> protip: leave three torches in the shape of a crude arrow
[7:32] <sorre> pointing back in the direction of your base
[7:32] <lobster> but the view thing isn't far enough
[7:32] <xRDVx> lol
[7:32] <hassifa> night
[7:32] <xRDVx> sorre: I love building towers from time to time
[7:32] <xRDVx> so I can just follow them
[7:32] <Genemos> It's not a gamebreaker, but it is kinda big anyway, anyone that knows how I do to report it?
[7:32] <xRDVx> and is more stylish
[7:32] <sorre> i'm building entirely underground
[7:33] <sorre> it's fucking badass, and no one would ever find it, if i didn't let them
[7:33] <Quatroking> :O
[7:33] <OpalMist> I build a tall tower, then a "pointer" tower a few steps away at the base.
[7:33] <Quatroking> I just thought of a way to enable water switches!

[8:07] <SireTRM> Slime spawning code needs a ton of work.
[8:07] <Darke> It's impossible when they come from 3 directions, taking away 4 hearts with each hit

[8:08] <sorre> notch should add the SkiFree yeti as a rare mob

[8:13] <Zaneo> that is to prevent you from falling off the map
[8:13] <PetiePal> Ahh that's what I thought
[8:13] <Zaneo> though there are holes that you can find
[8:13] <PetiePal> I kept trying to dig "around" it and go up and over

[8:14] <PetiePal> It gets tough bc after awhile you amass so much stone that you have to build boxes to drop it all in so it doesn't keep popping in your inventory lol
[8:14] <Peerko> there can be nice ores between the unbreakable blocks

[8:24] <Pilk> You die eventually

[8:25] <sLayed> but i found this one path made of diamond and i got like 15 in one vein...until i fell into the abyss

[9:03] <Cheeseyx> Sorry about using Mibbit, the internet at my house is down so I had to get online on a different computer
[9:03] <vede> I don't think it's that many, Iguana.
[9:03] <Iguana> Or 20
[9:03] <vede> Weren't you in it, Iguana? I might be thinking of Visiiri. :/
[9:03] <citricsquid> about 15 I think
[9:03] <nannal_> if you dont mind my prying, are the maps standard or infdev sized?
[9:04] <cheezychicken> infdev
[9:04] <citricsquid> nannal_: infinite
[9:04] <nannal_> oh lawdy lawds
[9:04] <Iguana> vede, yeh
[9:04] <Zaneo> they will have the option of both later though?

[9:05] <Iguana> Oh, lol
[9:05] <nannal_> I assume the map is issued each time the player joins, although for a large map that is heavily populated that could be X meg every few minutes

[12:00] <Lu-Mi> unf unf unf
[12:00] <bearz> invite lots of chinese people x---D
[12:00] <Macha_theShamanMouse> Lu-Mi, i knew it
[12:00] <Tuner> now why would it get DDoS'd?
[12:00] <Conde> The slime's attack is too fast IMO
[12:00] <Macha_theShamanMouse> you would do anything for it
[12:00] <Lu-Mi> nah... not 'anything'
[12:00] <Allezk> Why can't he just release an early test version of smp :(
[12:00] <Macha_theShamanMouse> orly?

[12:01] <CyberXZT> Do you have recommended server specs?
[12:01] <CyanRyan> Oh look, a Notch.
[12:01] <Notch> yes, kizzococoa. But they will be regional
[12:01] <Schaap> but snowman insulted the dutch :)
[12:01] <Moleman> Would mean a few weeks?
[12:01] <Kizzycocoa> need to know for the wiki

[12:03] <Macha_theShamanMouse> ok
[12:03] <Lu-Mi> for epicness
[12:03] <rob`> ChJees: the ability to distribute a minecraft store across multiple servers, for one, and abstracting away some of the fiddly details

[12:04] <Moleman> cactis
[12:04] <Allezk> lawl what a name
[12:04] <bearz> mwahahh
[12:04] <rob`> if minecraft used an SQL backend it would dramatically simplify having multiple minecraft "servers" all working off the same backend database
[12:04] <bearz> he just walked into cacti =)
[12:04] <AI> I wonder why you would find a cactus in the snow
[12:04] <Moleman> Cactus
[12:04] <Moleman> cactusi
[12:04] <Allezk> I saw it :D
[12:04] <khashai> Are fake ninjas like ruber ninjas, or are they more like cardboard cutout ninjas that you stick your head in and take a photo?
[12:04] <CyanRyan> Aww, tiny slimes still spawn on peaceful? :D
[12:04] <CyberXZT> rob that seems like it could be slow though
[12:04] <Firetempest> because it can snow in the desert too
[12:04] <_Sata_> um
[12:04] <Diablodoct0r|away> erm
[12:04] <Diablodoct0r|away> back for a bit
[12:04] <_Sata_> cactus grow?

[12:05] <AI> but "cactuses" will always suffice
[12:05] <_Sata_> I might make a little farm for cacti
[12:05] <rob`> CyberXZT: nah, that's just a question of DB optimization. It can be faster than filesystem access with the right indexes
[12:05] <Conde> what a waste of coal
[12:05] <TheCactusman> cacti is a highlight to D:

[12:08] <Xini> ^
[12:08] <Helar> dreams never come true.. you ahve to take action

[12:23] <Lu-Mi> i asked if they had BattleToads...
[12:24] <redic> is sc2 not working on xp?
[12:24] <Arsonide> Forums are tricky.
[12:24] <LG_Legacy> Because people can offer another free of charge for him.

[12:29] <Ranavalona> No, guys. What we NEED is a SLIME PLUSHIE.
[12:29] <N3X15> Allezk: Notch sometimes streams.
[12:29] <Cypher100> The theme I made for the forum was the hardest part :P
[12:29] <Firetempest> i hope that when slimes get transparency, then have a glowing core you can see in the dark
[12:29] <Cheeseyx> Creeper plushie
[12:29] <Allezk> But not right now :/
[12:29] <Ominus> oh well, time to continue working on this http://ScrnSht.com/tatnnv

[12:29] <Chezhead> Oh no! Notch is here! Barricade the doors!
[12:29] <Chezhead> !topic
[12:29] <Cial> Ranavalona, a slime pillow
[12:29] <TotempaaltJ> Notch!! Rename the Slime to a Blob or something. Slimes should be slimy, the current mob is more blobby.
[12:29] <TotempaaltJ> Or cuby.

[12:30] <Lu-Mi> i hope notch implements semi-transparency overall
[12:30] <LG_Legacy> Ahem
[12:30] <ColdFusion> For the rare times he is here he doesn't react/talk anyway
[12:30] <AI> I couldnt stand if the slime was called a blob
[12:30] <Chezhead> AI! I haven't seen you in a while
[12:30] <Ranavalona> Oh, I would so buy a slime pillow, Cial.
[12:30] <ColdFusion> maybe with the OP but thats it
[12:30] <Lu-Mi> would be neat for glass and leaves
[12:30] <Evil-Ville> the current slime is actually a gelatinous cube, hope this helps
[12:30] <Notch> i can't reply to everything!

[12:31] <ColdFusion> Very similar
[12:31] <Reluix> notch have you considered adding zip lines? if at all possible though open space?
[12:31] <LanternGhost> C++ is not really similar to java

[12:31] <Notch> stealth might come, yes
[12:31] <Chezhead> I really need to try learning to code, but I'm not sure which. Any ideas (this questions is directed to everyone)
[12:31] <Zerim> love red text
[12:31] <Cypher100> you will see it
[12:31] <Notch> I do know C++
[12:31] <LanternGhost> I have not used Java to much I am mainly a C++ Person

[12:31] <_Sata_> Cat that's how notch recorded it
[12:31] <Kizzycocoa> that slimes leave behind
[12:31] <Cypher100> :D
[12:31] <ColdFusion> Java is closer to C++ then any other language
[12:31] <Cheeseyx> Al, it could with semi-transparency
[12:31] <Notch> i haven't considered adding ziplines
[12:31] <ColdFusion> Other then C maybe

[12:32] <LanternGhost> Hey Notch do you have any idea when you will release a public version of SMP? Still a Month / 2 weeks?
[12:32] <Evil-Ville> too bad

[12:35] <Cheeseyx> Additionally, will SMP be available to free members at all once the game is fully released?
[12:35] <EmpiresBane> normally when this channel is flooded or is a little drama queen
[12:35] <TotempaaltJ> Notch: make the change of papyrus ... growing somewhere random higher! I've never ever ever seen papyrus.
[12:35] <Reluix> redic its just that your map has to generate more area so the new stuff can spawn
[12:35] <Conde> i lasted like 3 seconds
[12:35] <LanternGhost> Cheeseyx I don't think so
[12:35] <Allezk> anyone stil lsteaming ? :(

[12:38] <Epsilon1> lol'
[12:38] <Zerim> You're stalking him.
[12:38] <Conde> well, maybe not complex, just too dull
[12:38] <Arsonide> He should add tooltips so people can stop freaking out about what things are called... >:|
[12:38] <TotempaaltJ> Helar: More like, we're stalking Notch.
[12:38] <Lu-Mi> red stuff = mana
[12:38] <Cheeseyx> Hi Zerim
[12:38] <nannal_> the multiplayer server still up and who's streaming?
[12:38] <Allezk> Nuh hes ignoring !
[12:38] <Zerim> Cheeseyx, you just now noticed me? :<
[12:38] <tssguy123> Notch isn't replying because his name has been said 125 times within the past hour.
[12:38] <Zerim> hai
[12:38] <Cheeseyx> lol
[12:38] <Christoph> The wiki says it grows on soil next to water, but I've been roaming the map and have yet to find any coast lines with it.
[12:38] <Cheeseyx> Yes
[12:38] <Moleman> mana is blue silly
[12:38] <mib_gkl2z6> So much message that it looks like spamming
[12:38] <TheCameraWorks> When you make Notch a OP he kicks himself D:

[12:39] <Reluix> nannal_ they finished a little bit ago
[12:39] <nazgutek> christoph: damn, you found the wiki out, it was lying
[12:39] <Christoph> Yeah, I gathered from the description.
[12:39] <Cheeseyx> I used all my reeds
[12:39] <zerocool> if he had his client notify on highlight, then he's very naive
[12:39] <Cypher100> Is notch a retired as a game programmer?
[12:39] <AI> It's inexplicably-power-transferring-redstone-mined-magic-dust
[12:39] <Christoph> Since it grows quickly.
[12:39] <Conde> I'm gonna play some DF
[12:39] <Crix> the stuff triples about every 5-10 minutes
[12:39] <Cheeseyx> Not knowing you could farm them
[12:39] <Cypher100> is retired*
[12:39] <Lu-Mi> Moleman: most common, i've seen other variations though
[12:39] <Helar> he's not retired..
[12:39] <AI> Iptrmmd for short
[12:39] <zerocool> [12:38:47] <Cypher100> Is notch a retired as a game programmer?

[13:00] <LG_Legacy> Fucking lol

[13:00] <Kianon> i need some help with starting a server
[13:00] <Cheeseyx> You counter it with lots of torches
[13:00] <AzureAngelic> oh hey
[13:00] <Kael_> muddtusk: Don't stripmine! That's a bad tactic imo. Find caves, go spelunking! The deeper the caves, the more likely they are to have diamond. To be honest, there arent really any tips or tricks to finding diamond, other than using Cartographer or something, which I don't use. (Makes me feel like im cheating!)
[13:00] <TheCameraWorks> I want every material to be craft able :D

[13:01] <Cheeseyx> It's at 218 I think
[13:01] <Christoph> I know that, SireTRM.
[13:01] <Cheeseyx> 219
[13:01] <AI> Strip-mining is good if you can't find caves, or plan on using a ton of rock
[13:01] <Christoph> I have been looking.
[13:01] <Wirtualnosc> k thx
[13:01] <AzureAngelic> strip mining sucks
[13:01] <Christoph> But i've yet to find any bamboo on them.
[13:01] <sppt> so is DF2010 actually playable without all those really annoying bugs?
[13:01] <AzureAngelic> tnt mining is what the cool kids do

[13:03] <redic> ah question, is ther Rain in the alpha? cause in classic it is
[13:03] <rob`> the most efficient mining I've found is to do horizontal shafts 3 spaces apart - spelunking takes too long, stripmining is inefficient
[13:03] <TotempaaltJ> muddtusk: there was, but Notch fixed it, I think.
[13:03] <Wirtualnosc> 221
[13:03] <Cheeseyx> 221
[13:03] <Kael_> redic: no rain in alpha, yet. It may be coming when he implements biomes, though!
[13:03] <Cypher100> Totempaalt what should I put there?
[13:03] <SireTRM> Kael_, water spring/flow block next to any block of dirt, plant on the dirt
[13:03] <AI> @ Rob: two spaces apart lets you see everything between them
[13:03] <Kirsten> spelunking terrifies me...
[13:03] <Guno> Huh
[13:03] <AI> whereas three spaces hides a layer
[13:03] <Guno> my game RANDOMLY closed
[13:03] <redic> Kael: sad, but thank you :)
[13:04] <Guno> and almost killed me because while it saved my locations
[13:04] <muddtusk> Totempaaltj, what do you speak of?
[13:04] <Cheeseyx> Vertical veins could be missed
[13:04] <Kael_> SireTRM: I'll give it a shot!
[13:04] <Guno> it didnt save the enemeis i just killed

[13:04] <Christoph> Does the soil bamboo grows on have to have grass?
[13:04] <Cypher100> Totempaalt, what should I replace the stove with?
[13:04] <lawlpirates> Hi there Everyone
[13:04] <SireTRM> Christoph, no, just dirt next to water.
[13:05] <Rooster> So I heard C418 streamed MP.
[13:05] <TotempaaltJ> Cypher100: Hearts? I don't know!
[13:05] <Christoph> Hrmm...
[13:05] <Wirtualnosc> Yes.
[13:05] <LanternGhost> Yes he did
[13:05] <Kirsten> the reed plants just require to be within one water block, grass or dirt
[13:05] <AI> @ Rob: It's easy for one tile to be the difference between hit and miss if it is mostly above or below you
[13:05] <Cypher100> lol
[13:05] <Rooster> Anything exciting happen?
[13:05] <LanternGhost> Nope
[13:05] <LanternGhost> It was cool to see
[13:05] <AI> because there's a chance that just one block could be sticking down or up
[13:05] <Rooster> Anything informationy?
[13:05] <Drury> Everything is very buggy yet
[13:05] <AI> from the main mass of the vein
[13:05] <LanternGhost> but to tell you the truth all they did was stand around a lot and talk
[13:05] <Kael_> Rooster: He sure did.
[13:05] <Cheeseyx> Al, that's why you hit one block in the pillar
[13:05] <Drury> SMP will come in two weeks or more... And it's very buggy
[13:05] <Drury> Thats all
[13:05] <rob`> AI - oh, for sure. But I don't really care about missing the occasional one, the goal is to expose as many as possible, not to cover the territory 100%.
[13:05] <Guno> Lovely
[13:06] <Guno> theres a giant slimeblocking my path
[13:06] <LanternGhost> I did not see to many bugs
[13:06] <Guno> and he has no hitbox
[13:06] <Epsilon1> Aww i miss spawnable mobs
[13:06] <Guno> i cannot hit him
[13:06] <AI> What a shame

[14:29] <TheCameraWorks> Crashing is a reason I don't really care about playing SMP

[14:29] <DDRJake> then my cup of care is empty
[14:29] <Snowman> Can I invite Truewolves?
[14:29] <Cosmic_Fool> TheCameraWorks: he's talking about Alpha, not SMP
[14:29] <MathBuster> Crashing is the main reason to get the bugs out, I'd say. Thus; rather important
[14:30] <Rooster> Snowman: I think he's away right now.

[14:31] <Billen> Can you make chicken?
[14:31] <rcfighter> I'm serious here. If I die on any of my Alpha saves, the game crashes. Trying to reload the save so I can respawn causes a crash, too.
[14:31] <LanternGhost> What about the items?
[14:31] <LG_Legacy> Armor works fine
[14:31] <LG_Legacy> You can see other players with armor

[14:37] <Billen> it will be in there in at least some rudimentary form I suppose
[14:37] <LanternGhost> It would be a nice touch but not needed really soon
[14:37] <Snake_> It'd be hard to make an animation for mining without joints.
[14:37] <MathBuster> I'm sure it'll come soon enough

[14:39] <LG_Legacy> Half of the items given were randomly thrown by Notch
[14:39] <LG_Legacy> Notch could easily make us puke out items.

[14:39] <LanternGhost> That would be cool to see

[14:39] <LG_Legacy> Thats redstone

[14:40] <GarryH> he is minegod ??nuffsaid
[14:40] <LG_Legacy> Unknown if redstone works.
[14:40] <MathBuster> That sounds harmful for your digestive tract
[14:40] <rcfighter> Suddenly, I picture a bunch of players puking out diamond blocks, with Notch laughing in the background.
[14:40] <LanternGhost> Yea same here rcfighter
[14:40] <DeandreT> I want in so bad, I would pay 39$ to get in. It looks so fun
[14:40] <GarryH> you never tried using redstone?

[14:59] <MathBuster> And awful physics
[14:59] <Brotagonist> Here's an idea I had. Have the gravity to where if a block is in the air by itself, it falls. If it's connected to something else, it stays.

[15:01] <LG_Legacy> I'm trying to kill my mic
[15:01] <Rizyq> Didn't Notch already say he's considering making Obsidian a "floating" block, and if there's a floating island (not attached to the ground) it will fall without obsidian?
[15:01] <Baphomet> are slimes fixed yet? when I opened my client it said it was updating, but there were still slimes in the cave I was in on peaceful mode, but maybe they are leftover from before?
[15:01] <MathBuster> And magic is in Minecraft

[15:01] <Baphomet> no
[15:01] <Brotagonist> Oh sweet. Then you'd have floating power, basically.
[15:01] <Rizyq> I dunno :/
[15:02] <poke41> Obsidian + Red Shroom + Brown Shroom = Floating Obsidian block! :D

[15:09] <Soviet> wait
[15:09] <Baphomet> that would be such a processor strain. you'd have to have a flag on a block determining if it's OK or not, starting with the adminium on the bottom, and then check every single other block
[15:09] <Soviet> how i hook TNT with red wire?
[15:09] <Baphomet> to see if it's touching an OK'd block, and OKing it if so
[15:09] <Rehevkor> I see blocks in natural caves connected diagonally all the time, so I would assume that would prevent collapse as well
[15:09] <LG_Legacy> What the hell?
[15:09] <Brotagonist> no, just any block
[15:10] <MathBuster> I don't think it would. Sand needs checks like that - does it strain your processor?
[15:10] <LG_Legacy> Huh. Rooster you want to 'try' it?
[15:10] <Dark_Kostas> just put TNT together and then red wire
[15:10] <Rehevkor> otherwise the cave generation would have to avoid generating those diagonal connections in empty space
[15:10] <Dark_Kostas> when you use the red torch, boom!

[15:10] <Sonaclov> legacy have u posted a link yet <3 :>?

[15:10] <MathBuster> It could check on break
[15:10] <Risugami> btw falling sand is different from standard blocks

[15:11] <Rehevkor> yay, new stream!
[15:11] <Baphomet> yea and I've had maps with sand in impossible places and it doesn't fall until I break something on the stack

[15:11] <Risugami> also i've had indev floating maps with islands made of sand lol

[15:12] <MathBuster> @ snova & Baphomet I think it checks at the creation of a new chunk
[15:12] <Rehevkor> hey, I watch limewax's survival stream on justin.tv a lot
[15:12] <MathBuster> It could easily do that

[15:12] <MathBuster> Make a check on creation of a new chunk and upon break
[15:12] <Baphomet> I promise you it doesn't, I've found lots of sand ceilings in caves
[15:12] <LanternGhost> Ahh
[15:12] * Scelestic (Mibbit@ip72-200-97-149.tc.ph.cox.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[15:12] <MathBuster> true, but like Snova, I've also seen it fall down sometimes
[15:12] <Risugami> just don't touch it lol
[15:12] <LanternGhost> Which stream do I go to!
[15:12] <MathBuster> without intervention
[15:12] * konr (konr@91.108.17.129) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[15:12] <MathBuster> I don't know what the exact trigger is... but the trigger could be on break and upon creation of chunk
[15:12] <Baphomet> besides, implementing a floating block system that keeps structures afloat is immensely more complex than implementing a block that drops with gravity
[15:13] <MathBuster> Or it should be, anyway?

[15:13] <Baphomet> I am sure about that
[15:13] <MathBuster> I think coding wise it shouldn't be any harder than sand itself
[15:13] <MathBuster> I could try my hand at it
[15:13] <Baphomet> yes it would
[15:13] <MathBuster> Are you a coder?
[15:13] * tssguy123 (tssguy123@c-98-251-5-43.hsd1.ga.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[15:14] <Baphomet> if you can make a floating block system that keeps entire structures floating
[15:14] <Baphomet> yes
[15:14] <MathBuster> You have to think in simple steps
[15:14] <Baphomet> and you can also keep it from collapsing caves
[15:14] <Baphomet> and you can make it run smoothly
[15:14] <Baphomet> I will be impressed
[15:14] <MathBuster> Basically, blocks would stay in place as normal
[15:14] <MathBuster> However, like sand - it does a check upon break
[15:14] * evaldusia (nnscript@lan70-973.elekta.lt) Quit (Quit: ( www.nnscript.com :: NoNameScript 4.2 :: www.regroup-esports.com ))
[15:14] <Baphomet> no, no-- I'm not talking something like sand
[15:14] <MathBuster> The check is as follows: Block below or above? Block left or right? yes/no
[15:14] * mnjiman (Mibbit@d24-57-104-173.home.cgocable.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[15:15] <EmpiresBane> it's not impossible to do, just would take awhile
[15:15] <Baphomet> then you'd be collapsing whole caves by breaking the ceiling
[15:15] <MathBuster> If the check is no, the block falls and triggers a check for the blocks next to it

[15:15] <Baphomet> I'm talking about like
[15:15] <MathBuster> No you wouldn't. Because the other blocks are still connected

[15:15] <Baphomet> you have one block of obsidian in the center of a sphere, the whole sphere stays up
[15:15] <MathBuster> Indeed
[15:16] * _Sata_ (no@186.207.70.140) Quit (Quit: :tiuQ)
[15:16] <Axaj> it should work like the system for leaves
[15:16] <Brotagonist> anywhere touchign the sphere too.
[15:16] <MathBuster> That would work automatically, Baphomet
[15:16] <MathBuster> No checks needed for that
[15:16] <Brotagonist> Yeah, leaves is good.
[15:16] * Lutin` (Sam@c-76-106-200-142.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[15:16] <Axaj> but instead of leaves, any block but obsidian or adminstone
[15:16] <Risugami> lol we need gravity blocks, so we can have planets
[15:16] <Baphomet> okay but with your method if you make a tower
[15:16] <Axaj> also diagonally connected
[15:16] <Baphomet> and then another tower next to it
[15:17] <revenant> MathBuster: I agree.
[15:17] <Baphomet> then break the bottom blocks of both
[15:17] <revenant> Though the CPU usage would be... significant.
[15:17] <revenant> but
[15:17] <MathBuster> Both towers would fall one block, yes
[15:17] <Baphomet> they would both check, see they are next to blocks, and stay afloat
[15:17] <revenant> if you make it ONLY triggered by delete/builds, as you said.
[15:17] <revenant> then it would be fine.
[15:17] <Baphomet> why
[15:17] <MathBuster> Ah, you got me
[15:17] <MathBuster> Didn't think of that possibility
[15:17] <revenant> wait Baphomet
[15:17] <revenant> I have a solution to that.
[15:17] <Link2006> lol fakeholes
[15:18] <revenant> when you delete a block, it should check if theres a non air block above it
[15:18] <revenant> if there is, it falls.
[15:18] <revenant> and then checks recursively..
[15:18] <Baphomet> then you collapse caves by breaking the ceiling
[15:18] * gdude2002 (colesgaret@109.78.139.25) Quit (Quit: When life gives you lemons, throw them at people with expensive cars.)
[15:18] <revenant> no no,

[15:18] <revenant> agh dammit you're right :P

[15:18] * Azure (Azure@pool-173-73-131-141.washdc.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[15:18] <rob`> yeah, try deleting sand above you in a cave and see what happens
[15:18] <MathBuster> Hmmm. It could do a quick connector check for obsidian
[15:18] <revenant> hey Cat ^_^
[15:18] <revenant> what's up?
[15:18] * wareya (wareya@cpe-74-70-142-220.nycap.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[15:18] <Cat> why did u get banned from #mcc ?
[15:18] <Cat> what did u do?
[15:18] <Brotagonist> caves aren't just floating blocks.
[15:19] <revenant> I told TkTech it's silly to be overconfident :P.
[15:19] * DeandreT (Mibbit@76.178.191.51) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[15:19] <Baphomet> yeah but then you'd have to build the entire base of your floating thing out of obsidian
[15:19] <EmpiresBane> it should act like leaves
[15:19] <Cat> lol
[15:19] <Brotagonist> No.
[15:19] <Risugami> a block should check if it should fall by seeing if there is a block directly beside it in any direction except diag
[15:19] <Brotagonist> It would all just have to connect to one peice
[15:19] <revenant> I insulted the royal highnesses infinite knowledge.
[15:19] <MathBuster> Well. Not directly. Basically, it would check all linking blocks
[15:19] <Cat> revenant will u be unbanned?
[15:19] <rob`> there'd have to be complex rules about cave roofs, like "if there's another supporting block within 2 blocks diagonally, then you're fine" or something
[15:19] <revenant> I hope so.
[15:19] <rob`> but the short version: lag
[15:19] <revenant> TkTech is the only one against me being in there :\
[15:19] * wareya (wareya@cpe-74-70-142-220.nycap.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[15:19] <MathBuster> The only check would be obsidian yes/no and if no, flag it as checked and move on to the next one
[15:19] <revenant> as far as I know.
[15:19] <Baphomet> risugami, then you build two towers adjacent to one another and break the bottom and they float
[15:19] <Brotagonist> Yep
[15:19] <LanternGhost> Seems like a lot of people are getting invited to SMP
[15:19] <Brotagonist> Two peices or block woudl float
[15:20] * Boyofcheese (Mibbit@modemcable101.249-178-173.mc.videotron.ca) has joined #minecraft
[15:20] <MathBuster> If it reaches adminium, the check would be a definite no

[15:20] <revenant> OH SNAP NEW SCREENIE
[15:20] <revenant> http://i27.tinypic.com/35852jd.png
[15:20] <Risugami> hmm in that sense, there needs to be a world seed somewhere
[15:20] <revenant> palette is nearing completion :O
[15:20] <Baphomet> face it, you'd have to check every block starting with the adminium or obsidian, every time you broke a block. there's just too much to it
[15:20] <Risugami> a point that all blocks should try to path to
[15:20] <Mizser> revenant: do want~
[15:20] <Brotagonist> No.

[15:21] <revenant> I'm leaving for greece in 2 days D:
[15:21] <Brotagonist> Five blocks floating in the sky.
[15:21] <Cat> revenant you are using copybots source?
[15:21] <Brotagonist> One ont he end is obsidian
[15:21] <revenant> ah, no Cat
[15:21] <MathBuster> If we do get a working system... Even if
[15:21] <Brotagonist> If you break the block int he middle...
[15:21] <revenant> separate language entirely
[15:21] <Mizser> Well darn
[15:21] <revenant> but I am stealing his resource files >:D

[15:21] <revenant> Cat, I modeled the interface after his

[15:22] <MathBuster> No no, Baphomet is right
[15:22] <Dark_Kostas> which place are you going to stay?
[15:22] <LanternGhost> Man seems like SMP is coming together really well
[15:22] <Brotagonist> build a giant pillar of sand.
[15:22] <Baphomet> I still say A) it's going to cause a lot of lag and B) I don't know what's wrong with floating stuff in the first place
[15:22] <Brotagonist> Delete the bottom point
[15:22] <Axaj> how about the only things with mass are entities, sand, and gravel
[15:23] <Axaj> bam
[15:23] <Axaj> done

[15:35] <Helar> its almost public...
[15:35] <MathBuster> When it does arrive most of the annoying bugs have been sifted out
[15:35] <LanternGhost> Well watching it now it does not seem like there is a lot of bugs
[15:35] <LanternGhost> yea a few things that need adding in
[15:35] <Helar> furnaces doesnt work
[15:35] <Brotagonist> Dude. It's an Alpha.
[15:35] <LanternGhost> Smelting and mobs and stuff
[15:35] <MathBuster> @zuriki: Is there a chance? I haven't heard any such reports
[15:35] <Helar> thats the worst bug
[15:35] <Helar> dont*
[15:35] <Zuriki> MathBuster, yes.
[15:35] <EmpiresBane> MathBuster, a lot do

[15:36] <Rooster> ^
[15:36] <Brotagonist> ^
[15:36] <Zuriki> But to not buy the game because of that bug.
[15:36] <Helar> and if you wait for stable it's gonna cost you 2x
[15:36] <MathBuster> Just make a back-up and you'll be fine
[15:36] <Helar> soo your call..

[17:07] <Crix> the world will not accept us

[17:07] <Tesla> guys, do the SMP invitees get invites
[17:07] <Kokopure> it's still really easy to just break down the door.
[17:07] <Darkebrz> I'm going to not play SMP even though I have an invite
[17:08] <ActualDC> Because it's destroyed all my worlds up until this point.
[17:08] <Mattie2009> Personally, I'd make an obsidian wall, then lava, then more obsidian
[17:08] <Darkebrz> There is only 1 code for the SMP test

[17:08] <ActualDC> Dark, can I have your code? ;_;

[17:33] <shairn> sparta like?
[17:33] <csc> someone give an idiot an invite and he started inviting people?
[17:33] <JamesK89> Why don't you guys do a succession game? Those are crazy fun while waiting for SMP.
[17:33] <Snowman> Fatalis, Fatality
[17:33] <LG_Legacy> I'll kick em anyone.
[17:33] <Zerim> If 10 originals each invited 5 people, that's 50 people, and you KNOW they're all gonna want to play a lot

[17:33] <Dommys> Read the damned motd..

[17:34] <Stenlay> Who is inviting people?
[17:34] <ConflagratedCanine> I'm still waiting on a reply for the blackmail idea. :p
[17:34] <LG_Legacy> Why would id o that?
[17:34] <Mattie2009> People who ask for SMP codes are just butthurt they didn't get one
[17:34] <Kokopure> how many people do you think would jump in?

[17:34] <Snowman> WE BUILT THIS CITY
[17:34] <Zerim> caps
[17:34] <Kokopure> so, Notch's server is the ONLY SMP server, right?
[17:34] <ConflagratedCanine> And I can burn it to the ground.
[17:34] <Snowman> WE BUILT THIS CITY ON ROCK AND ROLL
[17:34] <shairn> personally I'm dying to play with other people on SMP but I know better than to ask for codes
[17:34] <csc> succession = dwarf fortess stuff?
[17:34] <JamesK89> We found that 30 minute intervals work the best and everybody gets to play serveral times a day.
[17:34] <Kokopure> and it's a max cap of 20?
[17:35] <Rooster> ya
[17:35] <Dommys> It's not just df
[17:35] <Fatalis> I'm pretty sure if someone just hands out a random code, the person who logs on will not do any sort of bug testing
[17:35] <Quatroking> sometimes the SMP client tends to not load a chunk at all, generating a black void
[17:35] <kaos86> Snowman, that song is old.
[17:35] <shairn> seriously how did all those beggars' parents raise them
[17:35] <JamesK89> Minecraft succession, DF style
[17:35] <Zerim> Fatalis, Of course not!
[17:35] <Dommys> But yeah, you might be familair with the concept due to it's popularity from df

[17:50] <Chomp> but guys ONLY Quatroking is allowed to play
[17:50] <Quatroking> the pass didn't get on /v/ yet.
[17:50] <Stealez> leaked the pw
[17:50] <AzureAngel> i will if i get in

[17:50] <Snowman> It was fucked

[17:51] <_Horrible> It came from the WoM channel, not the WoM people.
[17:51] <Nate_> it's not like anyone can do harm to the SMP build or server at all

[18:10] <Quatroking> I was listening to this jamaican song about a guy who farts on a bus
[18:11] <Lutin`> THey decompiled the code

[18:11] <mantam> Well, the people who had access
[18:11] <Agarrett> i would happily play

[18:11] <AzureAngel> pass leaked and everybody acts like it's the end of the universe
[18:11] <Agarrett> just PM me
[18:11] <AzureAngel> thats about it
[18:11] <Rooster> I had access
[18:11] <Quatroking> then all of the sudden a rapists comes and everybody complains about having a big mouth
[18:11] <Rooster> Now I can't play
[18:11] <Quatroking> Its... interesting.
[18:11] <Rooster> I got to play for like 45 minutes
[18:11] <mantam> Now the servers gonna be really crowded
[18:11] <Agarrett> hmm

[18:12] <rcfighter> That's why I'm still screwing around in singleplayer.
[18:12] <AzureAngel> notch doesnt care about the code because
[18:12] <AzureAngel> tomorrow
[18:12] <AzureAngel> everybody'll be playing starcraft
[18:12] <Agarrett> the game is going public?

[18:12] <Agarrett> haha
[18:12] <BurgaRaven> im pissed now
[18:12] <mib_e8wb10> i doubt it
[18:12] <Mattie2009> The server will probably be full until the release
[18:12] <Conundrumer> gg burgaraven
[18:12] <mantam> Weren't people allowed to give the code to trusted friends?

[18:19] <Killinkyle464> over 9000 trolls
[18:20] <Lantris> Yes Rooster if you got invited you think that
[18:20] <AzureAngel> password leaked
[18:20] <Drury> Xerdies, indeed, but some nerds are more foolish than others :D
[18:20] <AzureAngel> smp is public
[18:20] <Mattie2009> Anyone who gets this excited about buggy unfinished SMP is a douche
[18:20] <AzureAngel> nobody cares
[18:20] <shairn> Kom that couldve happened to any game
[18:20] <Lantris> Not to sound like an ass to you
[18:20] <Xerdies> ah not true
[18:20] <Rooster> I would accept not getting in.
[18:20] <Lantris> but the people who didn't get invited feel left out
[18:20] <FNugget> yay! server full
[18:20] <Xerdies> nerds are always the good one
[18:20] <Golden> Oh hope you guys get kicked from the server -.-.
[18:20] <Chezhead> It's so nice saying the password without people yelling at you.
[18:20] <AzureAngel> stop having such a seziure over it please
[18:20] <Zerim> troll griefers in SMP are gonna be like limp nodes in tiberium sun
[18:20] <Kom> Other games might be more secure in their methods too.

[18:21] <Rooster> Lantris: I was blessed enough to be invited by Legacy, and then some ass leaks it, now barely anyone who got invited can't play.
[18:21] <Lantris> But again comes the problem of only x amount of people got invited out of the thousands who wanted to get an invite
[18:21] <Drury> Oh crap, LG is serious now
[18:21] <mantam> On a topic not related to SMP, is creative multi down too?
[18:21] <Agarrett> you have as much a chance of getting into the SMP before the pass was leaked. Maybe you even have less a chance
[18:21] <Rooster> I don't think so.
[18:21] <Kom> It's not an MMO server or something
[18:21] <Mattie2009> It's sad because it's true
[18:21] <Zerim> mantam, no
[18:21] <Lantris> It's a two way street
[18:21] <Jacob_> minecraft.net isn't loading
[18:21] <mantam> Weird
[18:21] <realg> oh shit
[18:21] <Agarrett> seriously
[18:21] <mantam> Because I can't connect
[18:21] <Zerim> ah shit
[18:21] <Agarrett> just wait until night
[18:21] <Zerim> it isn't loading
[18:21] <Rooster> I have less chance now, Notch probably won't let people who got invited invite others
[18:21] <Drury> forums down, mainpage down...
[18:22] <Agarrett> then maybe there will be spaces
[18:22] <Drury> oh crap
[18:22] <Zerim> actually
[18:22] <Lutin`> Uh
[18:22] <Golden> I wonder of Notch did something XD
[18:22] <Zerim> nevermind it is
[18:22] <Lutin`> It's up for me
[18:22] <Lantris> it's morning were Notch Lives
[18:22] <Kom> The amount of people trying to get on compared to the amount of people who actually should be on has got to be at least 20:1
[18:22] <Drury> Twitter was down :/
[18:22] <lifeless> the page is up..
[18:22] <Lutin`> You guys are stupid
[18:22] <Black> I wouldn't worry so much about whats going on.
[18:22] <Mattie2009> Probably ddos'd from the password leak

[18:23] <Killinkyle464> notch should ban everyone on the game now, and get a fresh set of testers/code :D
[18:23] <Skorchy> Guys, someone on the livestream wants to know how he w=knows if the video is live or not?
[18:23] <Lapsus> Also, this is probably the best way of stress testing the server's connection limit :D
[18:23] <Lantris> Turn it off?

[18:24] <Agarrett> if notch didnt put a limit on the server
[18:24] <Kom> What would be better is if notch hosted multiple servers

[18:24] <Agarrett> it would crash

[18:26] <Lantris> The server notch is hosting will not be up 24/7
[18:26] <AzureAngel> i don't lol
[18:26] <Darkebrz> If you download the executable
[18:26] <RyMan> Drury: I have that but I have to log in, will that matter?
[18:26] <Darkebrz> Then you can play it offline

[18:49] <N3X15> Playing MP on a 20-slot server with 1000 people banging on the doors isn't my idea of fun.
[18:49] <Darktooth> There's no way dedicated servers are going to made for a while.
[18:49] <Fatalis> silly server
[18:49] <TrueWolves> I'm loving this.
[18:49] <Darktooth> And a while = 2 weeks.
[18:49] <Codlike> anyone here currently playing SMP on Notches server?
[18:49] <Killinkyle464> Update: Iv been trapped under rock
[18:49] <TrueWolves> You see
[18:49] <Fatalis> I should just come back in a few hours
[18:49] <TrueWolves> if you die on SMP right now
[18:49] <Killinkyle464> A sand cave collapsed on me
[18:49] <TrueWolves> you have to Disconnect
[18:49] <Fatalis> will prolly be empty
[18:49] <TrueWolves> so murder is a /real thing/ in the game.
[18:49] <Fatalis> or less people
[18:49] <extacy> I think everyone in there is probably really damn careful about dying/taking damage
[18:49] <Fiskie> Ok I crashed
[18:49] <TrueWolves> And someone is trying to kill the others.
[18:49] <Killinkyle464> Im... trapped underground
[18:50] <LG_Legacy> Heres a fun little thing for you guys.
[18:50] <Killinkyle464> I see a light...
[18:50] <Chezhead> Is anyone on here on SMP?
[18:50] <Killinkyle464> Is it..
[18:50] <Killinkyle464> its fire.
[18:50] <Killinkyle464> Oh god.

[18:52] <Darktooth> I'mma roll on here at 4 am
[18:52] <Darktooth> just to get dissappointed.
[18:52] <Fatalis> lol
[18:52] <Darktooth> then go to sleep.
[18:53] <Darktooth> ;-;
[18:53] <Outpost> Hay guyz
[18:53] <Aaerox> So... I'm sure this was asked like a million times already but, what's the player cap on the server?
[18:53] <Jacob_> It will be morning in Sweden then, Notch might shut it down
[18:53] <Outpost> Someone use logic gates and make pong in Minecraft.
[18:53] <Jacob_> 20
[18:53] <LG_Legacy> At the time of then, we didn't have the /iron command so we had to find other methods of getting iron. Iron is not smeltable even as of now in SMPB. http://filesmelt.com/dl/java_2010-07-26_16-33-17-60.png So notch made everyone start puking out iron bars.
[18:53] <Darktooth> Isn't it like 20?
[18:53] <Kokopure> is there griefing already?
[18:53] <Fatalis> I bet someone made a bot of some sort to bot to constantly try using the pass
[18:53] <Aaerox> Is anyone streaming it?

[18:54] <Fatalis> each time it takes a few seconds to log on, I get hopeful
[18:54] <cynicalAlchemist> Damn I suck at designing cannons.
[18:54] <Jacob_> If I get in, I will attempt to light all griefers on fire
[18:54] <extacy> Fatalis, try all of /v/ making a bot
[18:54] <Fiskie> Idiots building everything with fire
[18:54] <Fatalis> lol

[18:54] <Killinkyle464> its not...
[18:54] <Darktooth> I heard it spread on /v/
[18:55] <Jacob_> Someone said it in the WoM stream chat
[18:55] <Jacob_> then it got on /v/
[18:55] <extacy> and from /v/ to internet
[18:55] <Darktooth> I wish I was there.
[18:55] <LG_Legacy> First someone spread it on the WoM Stream, after constant baiting of hints and shit. Then it got on /v/ and then notch just revealed.
[18:55] <Iguana> Who spread it on /v/ though
[18:55] <Iguana> D:
[18:55] <Lantris> Who knows
[18:55] <extacy> Iguana, someone from the WoM chat probably
[18:55] <Lantris> It was going to get there anyway

[18:56] <Chezhead> I burned a tower down
[18:56] <extacy> Don't worry, if the original testers are lucky, notch probably will remake the server with a new code

[20:16] <Crix> The starcraft 2 campaign is going to be so baller
[20:16] <Lantris> Lol
[20:16] <satanmaster> jc, what is Starcraft 2 gameply like?
[20:16] <Lantris> 15 minutes for each mission
[20:16] <Crix> I love how you can buy upgrades/new tech/ mercenaries in the campaign

[20:16] <Therusher> see the Ghosts of the past trailer? :O
[20:16] <Mattie2009> Did you play the beta crix
[20:16] <Crix> lantris you don't even know what you talking about ><
[20:16] <Crix> and yes i did play the beta
[20:16] <Lantris> Oh yes I do
[20:16] <Crix> multiplayer is awesome
[20:16] <Mattie2009> Lucky bastard
[20:16] <Lantris> Also that one person is uninfected
[20:16] <Crix> and the map editor is CRAZY
[20:16] <Mattie2009> :(
[20:17] <Mattie2009> Wut
[20:17] <Crix> so custom maps will be off the hook awesome
[20:17] <satanmaster> Is Starcraft like Warcraft III? or WoW?
[20:17] <Therusher> custom maps were already awesome in beta
[20:17] <Lantris> It's like WoW
[20:17] <Crix> basically I would pay the full price for the campaign alone, multiplayer alone, or custom maps alone
[20:17] <Therusher> warcraft III but better
[20:17] <Crix> Starcraft is like WC3
[20:17] <Therusher> and in space
[20:17] <Crix> it's nothing like wow
[20:17] <Crix> lantris is trolling
[20:17] <Crix> It's an RTS with 3 races
[20:17] <Crix> pretty much the best rts ever
[20:17] <Lantris> Eh
[20:18] <Lantris> Age of Mythology or Warcraft is better imo
[20:18] <Therusher> nope, it only has 1 race, zerg. The others just don't know they're infested yet.

[20:18] <Canebrake> terran is very... flexible.
[20:18] <Therusher> worst race ever Crix
[20:18] <gordenfreechmen> no just kidding
[20:18] <Mattie2009> Toss n terr all the way
[20:19] <Crix> there is no worst race
[20:19] <Therusher> more like terran is very "I'mma lift off my buildings"
[20:19] <Cup> yeah but zerg's just badass. when i pick anything in a game i go with the most badass
[20:19] <Krysonian> Goodnight, all.

[20:23] <Rehevkor> protoss cannon rush. even if it fails you force your opponent to waste time and resources dealing with your one probe
[20:23] <Canebrake> humph.

[20:37] <TrueWolves> ConflagratedCanine, this channel has been around scense the game was but a week old.
[20:37] <Therusher> Scrippy, there will always be private servers where all the idiots get banned
[20:37] <LG_Legacy> I'm thinking about making this placem ore stricter and turning it into a no bullshit zone
[20:37] <ConflagratedCanine> That's not the point I was making
[20:37] <Scrippy> And thank god for that.
[20:37] <lex> starcraft in a few hours :3
[20:37] <Scrippy> Honestly
[20:37] <TrueWolves> I can make a hopefull request, I don't expect it to be good, but I can make the request.
[20:37] <GardenGnome> To anyone who has the invite code, I envy you greatly.
[20:37] <Scrippy> I'd rather be part of a non-private server

[22:30] <TehButter> Woah, what?
[22:30] <Peerko> in a few weeks SMP will be finished anyway ..
[22:30] <Cup> how does that work lol
[22:30] <DatOneGuy> Makes sense
[22:30] <General_ike> yeah
[22:31] <Bodie> DrakeHiggins: yeah notch mentioned that
[22:31] <Cup> OH yea
[22:31] <Bodie> because the processing becomes server side for some things
[22:31] <Cup> cuz no map generaton
[22:31] <General_ike> the last time I was this excited for something to come out was SSBB probably
[22:31] <DatOneGuy> Seems circumstantial though
[22:31] <Cup> same. and ssbb was kind of a let down
[22:31] <DatOneGuy> Same here Geeral xD
[22:31] <DatOneGuy> I loved ssbb :)
[22:31] <TehButter> let down, what
[22:31] <General_ike> yeah it was good but could've been better
[22:31] <TehButter> Meh.
[22:31] <TehButter> I loved it.
[22:32] <Cup> i liked the original two a lot better
[22:32] <DatOneGuy> Same here
[22:32] <DatOneGuy> Only reason I don't still play it is I never turn on my wii or tv
[22:32] <Cup> story mode was a bore in SSBB, you cant argue with that

[22:33] <Cup> true
[22:33] <General_ike> nope
[22:33] <General_ike> no dlc
[22:33] <Rikachu> cuz they should add new charactors...

[22:34] <Rikachu> aww why not unless they make a new one.
[22:34] <Cup> def
[22:34] <General_ike> lol I bet the next one will be for 3ds
[22:34] <General_ike> imagine a portable SSB... on second thought

[22:38] <Skorchy> Yes norton, I realize you take this as a serious threat to my computer. It edits the texture packs of rome total war to make the spartans not look gay, it kind of has to attach itself to something.
[22:38] <TehButter> Aurion: private testing; pw got leaked
[22:38] <Aurion> wat.
[22:38] <General_ike> yup
[22:39] <TehButter> ...#smp

[22:39] <Zerim> It's over 90,000... /crai

[22:40] <Skorchy> Why is it blocking youtube?
[22:40] <GARY_M_9> <Aurion> There's actually a legitimate SMP server running? <-- yep !!Thomas!!
[22:40] <Skorchy> Butter
[22:40] <Skorchy> Its using power abuse.
[22:40] <General_ike> because there's porn on youtube skorchy
[22:40] <Rikachu> Why Notch have to support meme?
[22:40] <TehButter> Skorchy: what
[22:40] <ConflagratedCanine> I'm surprised nobody cracked the client and hosted thier own
[22:40] <ConflagratedCanine> I mean... it's java
[22:40] <ConflagratedCanine> Not the most secure thing in the world.
[22:40] <Skorchy> MSN.com is blocked : reason: =D
[22:41] <Zaneo> erm the client isn't the problem
[22:41] <ConflagratedCanine> Lack of a server?
[22:41] <Zerim> It either really hates or really loves you, skorch
[22:41] <Zaneo> there is a seperate program running the server
[22:41] <General_ike> because it would be pretty hard to do and would take some time
[22:41] <Skorchy> Im going to rape it.
[22:41] <Skorchy> Anally.
[22:41] <Skorchy> And hard.
[22:41] <Rikachu> okay.
[22:41] <Skorchy> Then see if it'll work.
[22:41] <Zaneo> you can only see what it sends back to you
[22:41] <ConflagratedCanine> Of course, but--- actually yeah you're right.
[22:41] <General_ike> wouldnt be worth it because A)they would kick their butt kicked if caught
[22:41] <General_ike> and B)not worth the time it would take
[22:41] <Rikachu> banned off minecraft
[22:41] <General_ike> because SMP would be already out by then
[22:41] <Rikachu> If thats possible.
[22:41] <Zerim> shhhh, there are sssppiieesss
[22:41] <Skorchy> Youd hack it, then youd have 5 seconds, then notch would ban your ass, say, good job, go outside, and laugh.
[22:42] <ConflagratedCanine> I doubt that.
[22:42] <Zerim> hard
[22:42] <Skorchy> I don't.
[22:42] <Rikachu> Notch would destory everything in your server
[22:42] * Wafflez (jbrand@CPE-124-185-192-52.lns6.cha.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[22:42] <Rikachu> than the server itself.
[22:42] <ConflagratedCanine> He explained awhile ago why he doesn't like banning accounts
[22:42] <ConflagratedCanine> Since there's money involved.
[22:42] <Zaneo> what would it matter if you were banned, you would have the server
[22:42] * Chris (chatzilla@pool-68-163-255-62.bos.east.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[22:42] <Rikachu> yeah.
[22:42] <Rikachu> Valve has a van ban though.
[22:42] <Rikachu> But it works a bit different.
[22:42] <ConflagratedCanine> And just like the pass leak, he'd probably laugh and ignore it.
[22:42] <Rikachu> vac*
[22:43] <ConflagratedCanine> Knowing it would have no effect on his work at all

[22:43] <ph34r> wai?
[22:43] <General_ike> go to gamestop and do tag mode with some people
[22:43] <Draqo> He could just of closed the server
[22:43] <General_ike> for DQ9
[22:43] <DatOneGuy> >July 31st
[22:43] <Zaneo> he could have realeased an update that changed the pass, and done so on his client
[22:43] <Zerim> IMO the client needs more protection.. Bastards that haven't paid for MC logging in? What the hell I dont even
[22:43] * [JD] (fyzzy_nave@bb-205-209-95-76.gwi.net) has joined #minecraft

[22:43] <Rikachu> Hes one guy
[22:43] <ConflagratedCanine> Well there you go.
[22:43] <Bodie> i bet people are staying logged in when they finish playing
[22:43] <Rikachu> working on a game
[22:43] <Bodie> so they can play when they come back
[22:43] <Skorchy> I've never seen notch. Haven't talked to him. Haven't met him.
[22:43] <Rikachu> yep those bastards.
[22:43] <kaos86> we need shields in mine craft
[22:43] <Zerim> Skorchy, you have bad timing
[22:43] <kaos86> or a blocking system
[22:44] <Zerim> get up at, what, 11:00 your time
[22:44] <Skorchy> All I know is hes the one making me never see diamonds >=[

[22:44] <Zerim> 11 AM
[22:44] <General_ike> and spells for conjuring mine related stuff
[22:44] <Skorchy> And I get up at 7-8 am everyday.
[22:44] <Rikachu> You have to earn your MP Bar...
[22:44] <General_ike> and launching it at your enemies
[22:44] <Zerim> get on irc then, then

[22:47] <Rikachu> Oh gawd no.
[22:47] <Rikachu> Hats made the community bloodhtirsty

[22:47] <Zerim> Quiltlike mass of capes
[22:47] <Zerim> Smelt for scrap metal?
[22:48] <Chris> Multiplayer only. 64 blocks of Steel for one cape
[22:48] <DatOneGuy> Did someone say HATS?
[22:48] <Chris> BLOCKS of steel. Not bars
[22:48] <Azu> would capes work via floating slightly above the back like the head textures do
[22:48] <Rikachu> Blocks?!!
[22:48] <Zerim> steel, not iron?
[22:48] <Azu> that would be pretty fantastic
[22:48] <DatOneGuy> That sounds fair enough for status
[22:48] <Azu> especially if you couldn't make your own
[22:48] <Azu> er
[22:48] <Rikachu> So some guy would be flailing his cape around and laughing how awesome he is.
[22:48] <Azu> if it wasn't part of the skin
[22:48] <Chris> Steel, which requires coal and 2 iron bars to make
[22:48] <Zerim> capemaker ftw
[22:49] <DatOneGuy> Drop lava on him :)
[22:49] <Rikachu> then the other guys who used their iron to make weapons and iron murder him for the cape.
[22:49] <ConflagratedCanine> <Chris>Steel, which requires coal and 2 iron bars to make
[22:49] <Rikachu> weapons anr armor
[22:49] <Zerim> Did someone say batman?

[22:54] <Zerim> Rikachu, I envy you
[22:54] <Azu> I want something craftable that takes iron blocks
[22:54] <ConflagratedCanine> I think coal should create a nicer burn effect when thrown in lava
[22:54] <Azu> or diamond blocks, or obsidian blocks
[22:54] <Rikachu> But I dont even know what to do with the iron.
[22:54] <Rikachu> At least coal is useful >.>

[23:16] <Rikachu> Notch released the pass on his twitter.
[23:16] <General_ike> notch released it himself after the leak
[23:16] <Rikachu> Maybe he was testing how the server would hold..
[23:16] <MrBohica> So far so good
[23:16] <DrakeHiggins> the server was mostly full on legit people before the leak.
[23:16] <ConflagratedCanine> Here's to hoping Notch decided to release the buggy server software. :)
[23:16] <Rikachu> Of course becase those people who probably trusted by Notch.
[23:17] <General_ike> wish I would've actually gone to the forums and stuff
[23:17] <General_ike> when I bought the game months ago
[23:17] <DrakeHiggins> Really, Notch is one of the nicest people I've ever met.
