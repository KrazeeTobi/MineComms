[1:14] <Kodaichi> it might be more fun to be able to just poke fun at him from a distance.

[3:28] <Miclee> visiON, long-term use of snus can 'white patches to appear on the lining of the mouth and erosion of the gum where it is placed, and decades of use may increase risks of pancreatic cancer and cardiovascular disease (e.g. stroke and heart attacks)'

[7:56] <EmpiresBane> how do you do that on accident?
[7:56] <VurtualRuler98> yeah, I know
[7:57] <VurtualRuler98> This is a problem
[7:57] <VurtualRuler98> I always know about this normally!
[7:57] <VurtualRuler98> EmpiresBane, she meant to send them to her boyfriend.
[7:57] <EmpiresBane> ...over twitter?
[7:57] <VurtualRuler98> no
[7:57] <VurtualRuler98> she accidentally tweeted it instead

[7:58] <VurtualRuler98> I've done stuff like that before.
[7:58] <visiON> so umm.. how exactly can i unflood a dungeon?
[7:58] <EmpiresBane> i'm agreeing with TrueWolves
[7:58] <VurtualRuler98> Good thing the pictures didn't end up too popular.
[7:58] <VurtualRuler98> visiON, sponge
[7:58] <visiON> in indev, how to make one?
[7:58] <VurtualRuler98> you don't
[7:58] <VurtualRuler98> do it by hand
[7:58] <TrueWolves> well
[7:58] <VurtualRuler98> widh dirt
[7:58] <VurtualRuler98> slowly, dirt-ify the room
[7:58] <TrueWolves> unflooding isn't that hard in indev
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> you've put naked pictures of yourself on twitter?
[7:59] <TrueWolves> you don't need to dirtifi everything
[7:59] <eZek0> How do you do it then TW?
[7:59] <visiON> im like, at the most bottom
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> oh
[7:59] <TrueWolves> Just place a single block of dirt at the highest point of the flood
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> and ther's the bug
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> wher eyou cut the source
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> add a block at the top layer, then remove
[7:59] <VurtualRuler98> and wait for it to fizzle away
[7:59] <TrueWolves> remove the dirt
[7:59] <TrueWolves> and it will slowly go away
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> not a bug
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> it's a feature
[8:00] <TrueWolves> keep placing dirt and removing it to speed it up, but never move on to the next layer until the one above it is gone
[8:00] <TrueWolves> And yeah, that's not a bug
[8:00] <EmpiresBane> that was close.
[8:00] <VurtualRuler98> it was never intended for silly things to happen like that
[8:00] <EmpiresBane> almost had a scan running while playing
[8:01] <VurtualRuler98> anyways I will state now that redheads(fake or not) can pull off any breast size.
[8:01] <EmpiresBane> it works perfectly

[8:15] <Dommys> They're all pretty limiting.
[8:15] <Dommys> They should take the Champions Online and make Champions Offline.. and buff your player.

[8:16] <eZek0> If you had a PS3 I'd tell you to go play Infamous

[8:41] <Azathoth> congraduations vicrry
[8:41] <Azathoth> :D
[8:41] <eZek0> Vicrry im on mi wey 2 doin dat lollol
[8:41] <Navineous> I guess it can only detect 5 inches and lower.
[8:41] <vede> So, I've been starting to feel a bit inadequate because I haven't read any of the Discworld books. Like I'm just not the man I could be.
[8:41] <vede> But I don't know where I should start.
[8:41] <vede> Should I read the first one before the others, and just go in order? Or are they the type that you can just read any or all in no particular order and be fine?
[8:41] <eZek0> Start at the first book.
[8:41] <Azathoth> i can't help you there, vede
[8:41] <Vicrry> also
[8:41] <Vicrry> I hasn't read them
[8:41] <eZek0> Yeah, I haven't read any of 'em, but usually you should start at the beginning.
[8:42] <vede> I also feel as if my e-peen isn't quite as monstrous as it could be due to the fact that I also have not read any of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books.
[8:42] <Azathoth> lol
[8:42] <vede> So that's an alternative.
[8:42] <eZek0> Then you goddamn suck.
[8:42] <eZek0> Read the guide first.
[8:42] <Azathoth> i haven't read it either :[
[8:42] <Vicrry> WTF
[8:42] <Vicrry> READS GUIDE

[8:42] <vede> Okay.
[8:42] <eZek0> it's just an electronic pen, don't worry Roadcrosser
[8:43] <vede> Downloadin' dat guide noa.
[8:43] <liq3> Azathoth; why would any guy have an electronic penis?
[8:43] <liq3> Sounds like the kinda thing girls use to masturbate.
[8:43] <Roadcrosser> iunno
[8:43] <Azathoth> it's a measure of your internet badassery
[8:43] <Roadcrosser> but does epen exert any liquid?
[8:43] <eZek0> Damnit Azathoth, stop being serious.
[8:43] <vede> It won't be ruined by the fact that I watched that film, will it?
[8:43] <Roadcrosser> if it does e
[8:43] <Roadcrosser> w
[8:43] <liq3> lol i'm gonna start callin anyone with an epeen gay. :D
[8:43] <eZek0> The film is a tiny portion of the books.

[8:44] <Visiiri> Oh, is it?
[8:44] <Visiiri> Well,
[8:44] <Navineous> atleast I think it is..
[8:44] <eZek0> The movie or the game, Visiiri?
[8:44] <Visiiri> The movie, ofc
[8:44] <Visiiri> The game was nice.
[8:44] <Azathoth> it's going to suck because uwe boll didn't make it
[8:44] <Visiiri> They picked a game with little to no plot
[8:44] <Visiiri> and it's in the middle of the story
[8:44] <Navineous> Visiiri, do you still go on The Archives?
[8:44] <Vicrry> The first PS2 Persia game was pretty funs
[8:44] <Visiiri> :\
[8:44] <Navineous> Btw the movie will suck, the game was fun.
[8:44] <Visiiri> Warrior Within was my fav
[8:44] <liq3> Warrior within and Sands of Time are the only good ones.
[8:44] <liq3> ALl the others suck.
[8:45] <Azathoth> penis within
[8:45] <Visiiri> The original one was epic
[8:45] <eZek0> WHAT
[8:45] <Visiiri> Like, on the SNES
[8:45] <eZek0> Warrior Within was good?
[8:45] <eZek0> TT was better.
[8:45] <liq3> Visiiri: i well i mean out of 3d ones.
[8:45] <Visiiri> Sands of Time = TT
[8:45] <Visiiri> :P
[8:45] <eZek0> Two Thrones?
[8:45] <Vicrry> The latest PS3 game was alright, but there's glaring problems with it - like any time you got out your sword :P
[8:45] <Visiiri> Yes
[8:45] <Visiiri> One was the Wii version
[8:45] <Visiiri> the other wasn't
[8:45] <Visiiri> but it was the same game
[8:45] <eZek0> Hey, Vicrry, stop being a sony fanboy
[8:45] <Navineous> Time to go look at tigsource.

[8:47] <Navineous> Everyday I got here http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?board=6.0
[8:47] <eZek0> The one that just came out is called The Forgotten Sands.
[8:47] <Navineous> and why would that be Rooster?
[8:47] <Rooster> You skin animals
[8:47] <Rooster> And kill people
[8:47] <Navineous> Red Dead Redemption is a GTA western clone. (same company duh.) but still.
[8:47] <Navineous> Meh...
[8:47] <Azathoth> rofl
[8:47] <Navineous> skinning animals happen in real life...
[8:47] <Rooster> I don't know why, it's seems bad
[8:47] <eZek0> The 3D ones on the consoles have been called Sands of Time, Warrior Within, Two Thrones, PoP (no subtitle) and finally Forgotten Sands..
[8:47] <Azathoth> one of those posts is titled PEN15 EXTEN51ON

[8:48] <Rooster> I know why, it;s the saving and "fast travel"
[8:49] <Rooster> Such shit
[8:50] <Vicrry> Saving is a bit of a *pbbt* but I rarely use the fast travel thing
[8:51] <Visiiri> All that Rockstar really exceeded at was GTA
[8:51] <Visiiri> And the very original and creative graphics engine
[8:53] <Visiiri> It's unfortunate that Rockstar and Ubisoft engines aren't compatable.
[8:54] <Visiiri> By the way, if you didn't notice
[8:54] <Visiiri> Running up a slightly slanted wall in Assassins Creed 2, like \
[8:54] <Visiiri> has the EXACT SAME animation structure as running up a wall in Prince of Persia, TT or Sands of TIme
[8:54] <Vicrry> lol
[8:54] <Vicrry> Didn't notice
[8:54] <Visiiri> (The guy is different, but the animation is the same)
[8:55] <Vicrry> Cause I was too busy looking for random archers to stab in the neck
[8:55] <Visiiri> Well, there's not a bunch of slanted walls in AC2

[8:55] <Visiiri> That makes sense

[8:55] <Visiiri> Free running is different than sprinting
[8:55] <Visiiri> :\
[8:55] <Rooster> And the NPC companions are fucking annoying
[8:56] <Rooster> They keep screaming at me to do shit
[8:56] <Vicrry> That won't get a complaint from me
[8:56] <Visiiri> I really liked that
[8:56] <Rooster> I'm probably just tired
[8:56] <Visiiri> Only they walked just a little too slow for you
[8:56] <Visiiri> if they walked at an equal or greater speed, I'd be pleased.
[8:57] <Rooster> No, I had to constantly press the A button during a mission because I couldn't hold fucking auto-run
[8:57] <Vicrry> NPC AI is terrible usually - recent games have fixed this by leaving 'friendlies' mostly on the sidelines :P

[8:58] <Navineous> I agree.
[8:58] <Rooster> Does Best Buy let you return games if they are already opened?
[8:58] <Visiiri> No
[8:58] <Navineous> Western is boring. Quite uninteresting if you ask me.

[9:00] <Visiiri> And that broad dagger was the fastest
[9:00] <VurtualRuler98> and the few survivors are taken to a camp, but actually machinegunned down!
[9:00] <VurtualRuler98> So positive and cheery!
[9:01] <Vicrry> One thing I do like about RDR is that as soon as you get a lever-action rifle, why in the frakking world would you use the revolver? :P
[9:01] <Rooster> I know what you mean
[9:01] <Rooster> God why the fuck did I buy this game
[9:01] <Rooster> FML
[9:01] <Visiiri> Go fucking cry
[9:01] <Vicrry> I like it
[9:01] <Visiiri> at most it was $60
[9:01] <Visiiri> lrn2pirate first
[9:02] <Rooster> That's a lot of fucking money
[9:02] <Visiiri> What, one day of work?
[9:02] <Vicrry> And if auto-run is your only problem, I guess you need to go play every other game R* has done. They're all the same
[9:02] <Rooster> Whatever rich kid

[9:03] <Vicrry> Currently using a Winchester 1874 I think it was
[9:03] <Rooster> I don't feel like gambling my money for game that MIGHT be good

[9:03] <Navineous> Gamestop has a used return policy
[9:03] <Rooster> God dammit
[9:04] <VurtualRuler98> There is no such thing as that!
[9:04] <Visiiri> It lets you see major flaws and if you never play it again, you aren't out of money
[9:04] * VurtualRuler98 fires bullets
[9:04] <Navineous> Or atleast went to gamestop bought it used
[9:04] <Navineous> and then return it
[9:04] <Navineous> within a week
[9:04] <Vicrry> Used PS3 = $55. New PS3 = $60. >.> <.<
[9:04] <Navineous> Yes?
[9:04] <eZek0> Rooster: or you could get a job.
[9:04] <Navineous> You can return it
[9:04] <Navineous> xD
[9:04] <eZek0> Also, whales are better than you.

[9:05] <Navineous> Well
[9:05] <Navineous> you need to have the money
[9:05] <Visiiri> lrn2pirate
[9:05] <Dommys> Where are you getting a ps3 for 60 bucks at?
[9:05] <Navineous> just you get it back
[9:05] * VurtualRuler98 henry rifles you
[9:05] <Visiiri> why does nobody like pirates
[9:06] <eZek0> I agree with Visiiri.
[9:06] <Navineous> if you can bring the reciept and game back.
[9:06] <Visiiri> I buy the game if I spend more than six hours playing it
[9:06] <Vicrry> OMGZIHASTOPUSHABUTTONTORUN! WAAAAAAH!
[9:06] <eZek0> Dommys: he's probably ignoring tax
[9:06] <Visiiri> Otherwise it's not worth money
[9:06] <Dommys> I'll buy a ps3 for 60 bucks :D
[9:06] <Navineous> I agree Vis.
[9:06] <Navineous> I've saved so much money trying them out from gamestop
[9:06] <Navineous> I was trying Halo 2 didn't like it
[9:06] <Navineous> returned it
[9:06] <eZek0> Visiiri: Shouldn't it be more like 12 hours? I think of it the same as a money, about 5$/hour of fun worth.
[9:06] <Dommys> "trying" lol
[9:06] <Vicrry> Point of clarifiaction. PS3 GAMES
[9:07] <Navineous> pretty much.
[9:07] <Navineous> You give them money as insurance
[9:07] <Visiiri> Well, it should, I suppose
[9:07] <Dommys> Boo.
[9:07] <Navineous> and if you return it with the reciept within the week
[9:07] <Visiiri> But six hours is a long time
[9:07] <Dommys> I want a ps3 console for 60 bucks.
[9:07] <eZek0> Same as a money? I mean movie.
[9:07] <Navineous> you get your money back.
[9:07] <Dommys> lol
[9:07] <Visiiri> WHY ARE THERE NO PERFECT GAMES
[9:07] <eZek0> Vicrry: even 60$ for a PS3 game is good... With taxes usually isn't it around 80$?
[9:08] <Visiiri> I want a game with a world like Just Cause 2
[9:08] <Vicrry> no
[9:08] <Visiiri> Combat like Assassin's creed AND CoD
[9:08] <eZek0> That's impossible.
[9:08] <Vicrry> It's usually like $66 or so
[9:08] <eZek0> Fuck your low taxes.
[9:08] <Visiiri> Massively Multiplayer
[9:08] <Visiiri> ME2 cover system
[9:08] <eZek0> :|
[9:08] <Vicrry> Where you living with a 33% sales tax?
[9:08] <eZek0> You think ME2's cover was good?
[9:08] <Visiiri> completely dynamic plot line
[9:08] <Visiiri> I loved it
[9:09] <Visiiri> For once there was a reason to do more than rush as fast as you can and punch them in the face
[9:09] <Visiiri> (like timeshift)
[9:09] <Dommys> Doritos, Pizza/Ranch
[9:09] <Dommys> Yes.

[9:28] <EmpiresBane> what are you doing?

[9:28] <EmpiresBane> yeah
[9:29] <EmpiresBane> you'd just have to fugure the input

[9:29] <Azathoth> i don't know. it would probably require some really low level programming though
[9:29] <Azathoth> :S

[9:46] <Azathoth> i hope she likes it
[9:46] <EmpiresBane> be careful

[10:17] <Azathoth> he probably means actively conversing in this channel
[10:18] <Vicrry> which there were few of
[10:18] <Vicrry> And now there's more
[10:18] <Vicrry> But not him
[10:18] <Azathoth> :P

[10:31] <Kodaichi> haha, so Newgrounds made their own shitty flash-based version of IRC
[10:31] <Kodaichi> it's utterly horrible and so easy to troll on
[10:31] <Vicrry> there's 0 mods on it
[10:31] <Kodaichi> and it's still being developed, so half of the people don't even know wht a /me is
[10:32] <Dommys> MODS ARE ASLEEP
[10:32] <Vicrry> And Newgrounds has the finest collection of 10yr old idiots, so combined with no mods...

[10:36] <EmpiresBane> is EVE online good?
[10:36] <Vicrry> ...
[10:36] <Vicrry> Difficult question EmpiresBane
[10:37] <Vicrry> I dislike it now, zero challenge and there's nobody I want to play with
[10:37] <Vicrry> When I first started, it was the fraggin business
[10:38] <EmpiresBane> doesn't sound like something i want then
[10:38] <Vicrry> Also, it's not something you can do for an hour or so a day or every other, it does need some commitment
[10:39] <EmpiresBane> what does that mean?
[10:39] <EmpiresBane> every day?
[10:39] <EmpiresBane> multiple hours?
[10:39] <Vicrry> Depends on who you find as corpmates
[10:39] <EmpiresBane> i can't do that
[10:39] <Vicrry> An hour or two daily usually
[10:39] <EmpiresBane> i can only play on weekends
[10:40] <Vicrry> It's a world that changes with or without you, so you best be keeping up. If you don't have the time I'd suggest something else
[10:41] <VurtualRuler98> additionally, my sound system can make my desk properly follow with the sound
[10:41] <VurtualRuler98> result?
[10:41] <VurtualRuler98> Heartbeat physically felt inside my desk
[10:41] <VurtualRuler98> very disturbing
[10:41] <VurtualRuler98> EmpiresBane, I know people who really like eve.
[10:41] <VurtualRuler98> I'd like eve if I could fly a fighter in first person :(
[10:42] <Vicrry> That's one big thing I dislike about Eve. You're not so much as piloting/driving the ship as playing coach from sidelines
[10:44] <VurtualRuler98> Infinity looks fun, I can FLY THINGS
[10:44] <VurtualRuler98> :D
[10:44] <VurtualRuler98> 3999 tank damage :D
[10:44] <Vicrry> Infinity looks like the OMFGWIN
[10:44] <VurtualRuler98> okay guys, GL+exploding ammo
[10:44] <VurtualRuler98> WHICH DO I DROP
[10:45] <Vicrry> ?

[10:45] <VurtualRuler98> Looking at a wide inventory of weapons here.
[10:45] <Vicrry> Still VERY alpha
[10:45] <VurtualRuler98> Primaries: GL, M16, SPAS
[10:45] <Vicrry> ? what game?
[10:45] <VurtualRuler98> left 4 dead 2
[10:45] <VurtualRuler98> mutations make it fun again
[10:45] <Vicrry> oh
[10:46] <Vicrry> I'd stay away from the GL
[10:46] <EmpiresBane> mutations?
[10:46] <VurtualRuler98> I like the GL
[10:46] <VurtualRuler98> secondaries include single and double pistols, DEAGLE BRAND DEAGLE, crowbar, and golf club.
[10:46] <Vicrry> M16/SPAS, depending on the situation
[10:46] <Vicrry> And I personally like the deagles
[10:46] <VurtualRuler98> backup is either exploding ammo, or health.
[10:47] <Vicrry> HP
[10:47] <VurtualRuler98> the only real question here is wether I want to roll with the GL, or the M16.
[10:47] <Vicrry> M16
[10:47] <VurtualRuler98> and you are silly
[10:47] * Moocman (Moocman@191.a.001.gld.iprimus.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[10:47] <VurtualRuler98> picking the SPAS as a viable option! Silly you!
[10:47] <Vicrry> GL is too situational for me
[10:47] <VurtualRuler98> I am not you.
[10:47] <Vicrry> SPAS is very handy for my playstyle
[10:47] <VurtualRuler98> I have years of experience with everything, ever. I can hit anything. :D
[10:47] <VurtualRuler98> or drop my doubles and go with a crowbar because crowbars are awesome.
[10:48] <VurtualRuler98> meh, there's always guns at the end, and everywhere inbetween
[10:48] <VurtualRuler98> and I'm fighting SI here.
[10:48] <VurtualRuler98> I guess I'll leave the frag rounds.

[10:48] <Vicrry> I usually playing co-op, so everyone else has hunting/m16's to deal with special/common hordes, however when the tank shows they're suddenly glad there's a SPAS on the team
[10:48] <Dommys> I've never liked L4D
[10:49] <VurtualRuler98> boom, :D
[10:49] <Vicrry> Nothing has the damage dump capabilities of the shotty's :P
[10:49] <VurtualRuler98> I can kill the tank with anything, also.
[10:49] <VurtualRuler98> including gravity if it hurts him
[10:50] <VurtualRuler98> down the crevase, mr tank.
[10:50] <VurtualRuler98> I've even had hardcore tank killing moments in the first left 4 dead.
[10:50] <Vicrry> I'm generally terrible on my own with AI survivors, I tend to play support for others :P
[10:50] <Vicrry> Also, I don't FPS much so :P
[10:50] <VurtualRuler98> I'm playing without bots right now
[10:51] <VurtualRuler98> so you suck at shooting, no wonder you take the SPAS
[10:51] <VurtualRuler98> Gunning one down, mostly myself, running backwards through the area before the sewers map, backed into a wall...
[10:51] <VurtualRuler98> and jump out the back of a window, still shooting, tank jumps out with me, I'm backing accross thes treet, out of ammo, reloading, and he's almost pinned me to a wall
[10:51] <VurtualRuler98> and then he dies at my feet.
[10:52] <VurtualRuler98> Tank in the elevator shaft at the last map, he then falls down, and runs around for ages, making smoke, revealing his outline.
[10:52] <VurtualRuler98> then I waited a while, threw down a molotov.

[10:56] <darkedone02> listen to all of these orchestrated music.
[10:56] <Vicrry> Anyway, the shotguns tend to be epic support weapons. They're not really meant to stand on their own, just when it's time to clear a hallway, drop the tank in a fraggin hurry or dump on a startled witch there's not much else to compare
[10:57] <VurtualRuler98> ...
[10:57] <VurtualRuler98> have you even played the game?

[11:40] <vede> Vurt, you'd be a judge.

[11:40] <vede> Because otherwise it'd be unfair.
[11:40] <VurtualRuler98> no no no
[11:40] <VurtualRuler98> I'd come on under another name
[11:40] <vede> We could have a rapid deletion contest immediately following the build compo.

[11:42] <VurtualRuler98> I win many large mazes.

[11:47] <VurtualRuler98> kicking the bots

[11:48] <Visiiri> Anyways, the point is this -> .
[11:48] <TrueWolves> mostly becuase it sounds better then suttering.
[11:48] <Visiiri> The new mutation sucks because they took out common infected and left special infected

[14:53] <Azathoth> and it should be possible to completely sever limbs from people, but the person doesn't have to be dead
[14:53] <Azathoth> and if it happens to you, you can only use pistol
[14:53] <Azathoth> or crawl, depending on the limb

[16:22] <VurtualRuler98> what games were out before half-life
[16:22] <Azathoth> really the best thing about half-life and half-life 2 are the modding communities
[16:22] <VurtualRuler98> quake, doom, other generic shooters where the point was KILL EVERYTHING, NEXT MAP
[16:23] <Azathoth> so? that doesn't make half-life the perfect game ever
[16:23] <VurtualRuler98> then half-life was like sup, and people who may have expected ye olde level-by-level shooting
[16:23] <VurtualRuler98> suddenly were on a tram, going to work.
[16:23] <Azathoth> most perfect*
[16:23] <VurtualRuler98> then something went bad, and they were fighting for their life, in what was actually a location, and not just random levels.

[16:24] <VurtualRuler98> hahahahah
[16:24] <VurtualRuler98> anyways

[16:25] <Speljohan_> not like anyone cares
[16:25] <VurtualRuler98> Then half-life 2 ran in, doubly flipping the bird, and did everything, having even more advances.
[16:25] <Speljohan_> lol
[16:25] <Azathoth> getting my ass kicked is not fun for me
[16:25] <Azathoth> i don't give a flying cock if anyone else cares
[16:25] <Speljohan_> that's the only way to learn Azathoth
[16:25] <VurtualRuler98> Every proper valve game ends up having a few major massive innovations.
[16:25] <Speljohan_> applies to everything
[16:25] <Azathoth> half-life 2 wasn't really that special
[16:25] <Speljohan_> a defeat is usually more valuable than a victory
[16:26] <VurtualRuler98> Sure, now
[16:26] <VurtualRuler98> but back in 2004?

[16:26] <bildramer> Azathoth, I can't rape you
[16:26] <Speljohan_> to go from an awesome action/strategy/rpg hybrid
[16:26] <Speljohan_> into a fucking fps
[16:27] <Speljohan_> it's blasphemy

[16:28] <Azathoth> it's rpg eating rts's cock
[16:28] <VurtualRuler98> tick tick tick tick tick tick FINALLY I CAN ATTACK
[16:28] <VurtualRuler98> 2 dmg :(
[16:29] <Azathoth> wow. this battle system is pretty good
[16:29] <Azathoth> even though jrpgs fucking suck
[16:29] <VurtualRuler98> tick tick tick ENEMY'S TURN, buttrape^(pi*i) damage!
[16:29] <VurtualRuler98> tick tick tick IS IT MY TURN NO IT'S ENEMY'S TURN, game over!
[16:29] <Speljohan_> <Azathoth> even though jrpgs fucking suck
[16:29] <Speljohan_> this
[16:29] <bildramer> rearrange the letters of "one door" to make one word
[16:29] <Speljohan_> except the first ff games for nes/snes were awesome
[16:29] <bildramer> lol
[16:30] <Speljohan_> when it turned 3d everything about it sucked
[16:30] <VurtualRuler98> one of the many reasons I hate turn based RPGs, except maybe where people realize FAST GUY ATTACKS, THEN SECOND FAST, AND SO ON is a sane idea.
[16:30] <VurtualRuler98> dooorne?
[16:30] <Speljohan_> i prefer realtime rpg's
[16:30] <Speljohan_> like baldur's gate
[16:30] <VurtualRuler98> dooorne sounds like a dark type pokemon.
[16:30] <VurtualRuler98> an evil... door
[16:30] <Speljohan_> where you can also pause
[16:30] <Speljohan_> and plan out tactics

[16:32] <Azathoth> man, xcom was great
[16:32] <Speljohan_> dink smallwood is the best pc action rpg evar
[16:32] <Azathoth> but sooooo hard
[16:32] <Speljohan_> "The game centers on Dink, a pig farmer-turned-hero who embarks on various quests throughout his world. The game features isometric, Zelda-like gameplay, including weapons, items, and magic. The game has a satirical off-color slant, including everything from a fiercely abusive uncle to a town that worships ducks. Dink is never freed from the grievances of being a pig farmer, a fact he is far too often reminded of by his nemesis, Milder Flatstomp."
[16:32] <bildramer> omg a destruction of cats
[16:32] <Speljohan_> that's one of the reasons it was awesome Azathoth
[16:32] <Azathoth> i hated it when my doods died
[16:33] <Azathoth> and the dead xcom member sprite was so ugly, it just made it worse
[16:33] <Speljohan_> the difficulty makes it more fun tho Azathoth
[16:33] <Speljohan_> if it was easy i'm sure it would suck
[16:33] <Azathoth> yeah
[16:33] <Azathoth> like most of the modern remakes
[16:33] <Azathoth> they're too easy
[16:33] <Speljohan_> ye
[16:33] <Azathoth> all the UFO: games
[16:33] <Speljohan_> i liked first UFO game best
[16:34] <Azathoth> UFO: alien invasion is pretty good though
[16:34] <Azathoth> and freeware
[16:34] <Speljohan_> i mean, making the new one an fps is blasphemy
[16:34] <Speljohan_> way to ruin the whole concept

[17:20] <Jenxas> the only solution is to completely get rid of it.
[17:21] <Jenxas> Also
[17:21] <Jenxas> Why Diamond?
[17:22] <sllide> diamond is hard to find :3
[17:22] <Jenxas> No, but he is using diamond tools in that picture.

[17:23] <Jenxas> Steel and Stone tools are much more effective because you can make bunches and still have them left over
[17:23] * devilKing is now known as King
[17:23] <Jenxas> but then again that goes through a bunch of sticks
[17:23] <Quatroking> To be honest I hacked the diamond into my savegame
[17:23] <fizix> hey, I'm hollowing out a huge cavern in indev and it's taking hours and hours without tnt, but when I go creeper hunting at night for ash I come across about 4 creepers per night... is there anyway to spawn or duplicate items through bug explots or anything like that?
[17:24] <Jenxas> As expected.
[17:24] <Quatroking> I just want to build amazing stuff
[17:24] * Marach (Marach@188-93-163-103.home.aster.pl) has joined #minecraft

[17:24] <Quatroking> and its tiresome to constantly run back to my supply room to get some new gear because the old gear broke
[17:24] <Quatroking> Marach: You don't have one?
[17:25] <Marach> but there's that damn blocker i have no idea how to get it out
[17:25] <Quatroking> that blocker is the IDE cable idiot
[17:25] <Quatroking> or ata
[17:25] <Marach> stfu qk
[17:25] <Quatroking> sata*
[17:25] <Jenxas> Quatroking, I would build amazing stuff like that toooo
[17:25] <Marach> on the front
[17:25] <Quatroking> Seriously though, what kind of blocker?
[17:25] * Roadcrosser is now known as RoALTcrosser
[17:25] <Jenxas> but I never spawn in a good location, and I'm picky about mine. D:
[17:25] <Quatroking> frontpanel?
[17:25] <Marach> yeah
[17:25] <Marach> ...
[17:25] <fizix> poke it out from the other side
[17:26] <Jenxas> I also want to spawn in a place where I don't have to go hiking to my kingdom
[17:26] <Marach>
[17:26] <Quatroking> Yeah, get flathead screwdriver and squish it out
[17:26] <Jenxas> every time I die if I do die.
[17:26] <Quatroking> works fine.
[17:26] <Marach> ?
[17:26] <Marach> it will probably break.
[17:26] <Quatroking> not really
[17:27] <Quatroking> at least not if you somehow manage to fuck up
[17:27] <Quatroking> I mean, shit, you put your screwdriver between the plate and your frontpanel frame and woop it plops out
[17:27] <pontusedberg> so any how...
[17:27] <Marach> i won't come out either way
[17:27] <Marach> looks locked

[17:31] <VurtualRuler98> Also, a mysterious spot in my driveway, which, despite a shiny rock neraby(gold-like, but obviously not gold, as gold does not become gravel), cannot have the source of metal removed.
[17:31] <VurtualRuler98> just... mystery beep
[17:32] <Marach> the panels extend to the sides.
[17:32] <sllide> wait

[17:32] <sllide> if my pc can play borderlands and dark messiah then why not minecraft? xD
[17:32] <VurtualRuler98> because minecraft requires java
[17:33] <Marach> WHAT THE FUCK
[17:33] <sllide> yeah i noticed that..
[17:33] <VurtualRuler98> Now where do I store this metal detector anyways.
[17:33] <Marach> i'm going to break it in half
[17:33] <sllide> stupid light weight gaming lib thing
[17:33] <Adurah> Have you tried opening it instead of removing it?

[17:34] <sllide> with a hamer
[17:34] <VurtualRuler98> Why was smoeone poledancing like a drunk on TV
[17:34] <sllide> heat a paperclip
[17:34] <sllide> and cut it
[17:34] <sllide> thats what i do :)
[17:34] <Marach> ...
[17:34] <VurtualRuler98> heat a paperclip hot enough and it'll cut through anythign.
[17:35] <VurtualRuler98> make plasma

[19:03] <fizix> are you seriously proud of your country?
[19:03] <VurtualRuler98> America isn't some kind of blood-derived quality you get just because nobody can remember your family migrating
[19:03] <VurtualRuler98> It's something you are.
[19:03] <thechris> and im pretty sure they never lost a war either
[19:03] <VurtualRuler98> You know how you be American? You start going "Hey, that's seriously screwed up, and I am not okay with that!" when something is screwed up, and you are not okay with that.
[19:04] <fizix> there's not a nation on the planet that should have proud people. everyone has at one time or another fucked over of even killed another peoples, and in this modern time there's not a single forn of government that is working right

[19:13] <fizix> if britland introduced conscription again to ramp up the fight I'll tell my local recruitment branch to fuck themselves
[19:13] <VurtualRuler98> some do it for teamwork and other stuff like that

[20:01] <AndrewPH> probably
[20:01] <VurtualRuler98> and then a micro-to-normal game link cable, and trade with myself. :D
[20:01] <KodaichiZerp> cool
[20:01] <VurtualRuler98> then beat one of my few IRL friends in pokemons by out trading myself ing
[20:02] <KodaichiZerp> never was interested in anything beyond silver though
[20:02] <AndrewPH> get soul silver
[20:02] <VurtualRuler98> that can't tradew ith gen 3.
[20:02] <AndrewPH> best remake evar
[20:02] <KodaichiZerp> until of course they came out with gardevoir and lopunny lol
[20:02] <VurtualRuler98> no it is lame
[20:02] <VurtualRuler98> gold/silver are pwn
[20:02] <KodaichiZerp> i have soulsilver :P
[20:02] <AndrewPH> VurtualRuler98, read: remake
[20:03] <VurtualRuler98> the remakes always suck
[20:03] <KodaichiZerp> nah!
[20:03] <KodaichiZerp> i like ss
[20:03] <VurtualRuler98> but I cannot combine a technician scyther+aerial ace+choice band or whatever+STAB bonus in gold or red.
[20:04] <KodaichiZerp> heh. i am so behind on the advenced choices
[20:04] <VurtualRuler98> basically the technician ability buffs the power of aerial ace
[20:04] <VurtualRuler98> so does STAB, and the choice band.
[20:04] <KodaichiZerp> i just wanna maybe catch raikou or something.
[20:04] <VurtualRuler98> resulting in a very powerful move
[20:04] <VurtualRuler98> which would be a funny thing, like the whole "rattata-level-1"
[20:05] <VurtualRuler98> I SHOULD DO THAT IN RUBY TO MESS WITH MY FRIEND SOMETIME
[20:05] <KodaichiZerp> by the way, the best way to go about it is to weaken it a ton, sleep it, and from then on use fast balls
[20:05] <VurtualRuler98> raikou fled
[20:05] <AndrewPH> fast balls get worse as the match goes on

[20:05] <VurtualRuler98> use ultra ball

[20:06] <VurtualRuler98> there's only one.
[20:06] <KodaichiZerp> i know. but fast balls give 4X chance, while ultra balls only give 2X
[20:06] <VurtualRuler98> it is hitler powerful
[20:06] <AndrewPH> isn't that only on the first few turns?
[20:06] <KodaichiZerp> by the way, its only on the first

[20:07] <VurtualRuler98> what move was that
[20:08] <KodaichiZerp> hehe. theres also faint attack
[20:08] <KodaichiZerp> less touble, more rubble
[20:08] <VurtualRuler98> It'd be so funny to take his leet team that has no meta coherence
[20:08] <VurtualRuler98> and wipe the floor... with rattata
[20:09] <KodaichiZerp> yeah
[20:10] <VurtualRuler98> focus sash

[21:15] <Visiiri> Wait- do transparencies work in the skins now?
[21:15] <Jat> you need to make the 3d preview show the extra head layer
[21:15] <TrueWolves> ... do they?

[21:16] <Jat> i like how the arthas skin looks like something but looks nothing like arthas
[21:16] <Visiiri> Erm, can't link
[21:16] <TkTech> Visiiri: Transparency worked in Notch's official 3D preview
[21:16] <TkTech> Visiiri: So I allow it in the flash version
[21:16] <Visiiri> Does it work in MP?
[21:17] <TkTech> Visiiri: Nope
[21:17] <Visiiri> :(
[21:17] <TkTech> People still like making them tho'
[21:17] <TkTech> There are a bunch of semi-invis skins
[21:17] <Jat> also gentleman in the buff looks like an awesome skin
[21:17] <TkTech> Jat: The extra layers are more complicated then they should be, but it'll be up shortly as well
[21:18] <TkTech> You need to have a compatibility layer for older skins
[21:18] <TkTech> That filled the skin with something other then a transparent color
[21:18] <TkTech> say, black
[21:18] <TkTech> (which a lot did)

[21:18] <Visiiri> Alrighto
[21:18] <TkTech> you need to analyze the image to determine if another color was used to flood and then turn that into the new alpha for that layer
[21:18] <Visiiri> Are you planning to add ratings?
[21:19] <Visiiri> Number of times used?
[21:19] <TkTech> Visiiri: Ratings already exists, buttons just missing :P
[21:19] <Visiiri> :P
[21:19] <TkTech> there are 1532 votes for skins
[21:19] <Visiiri> TBH, I really like the site
[21:19] <Visiiri> It should be the official one ftw
[21:19] <TkTech> Note this is the Alpha version, I'm just looking for community input right now before going to beta

[21:24] <Visiiri> (I don't know how it would work, but it would be slick)

[21:25] <Visiiri> sweet
[21:25] <Jat> it needs a search function and maybe categories
[21:25] <Jat> the current system kind of sucks
[21:25] <Jat> i mean ist good as a general skin browser
[21:26] <Visiiri> "There's a search button, there's just no icon for it" ??
[21:26] <Jat> but it needs categories and a search
[21:26] <Jat> what??
[21:26] <TkTech> I'll hopefully have time to redo the skin editor I previewed on the forums eons ago and get it in before release
[21:26] <Visiiri> Just guessing
[21:26] <TkTech> Jat: If you look at the underlying API calls it has a &s= parameter for doing searches :P
[21:26] <TkTech> Just no UI for it
[21:26] <Jat> what?
[21:26] <Jat> what does?
[21:26] <Visiiri> BFMV ftw
