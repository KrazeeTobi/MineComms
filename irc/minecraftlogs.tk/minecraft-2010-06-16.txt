[0:06] <Kokopure> but it's just not brilliant
[0:06] <ZaxKellens> Something wrong with my infdev

[0:07] <furrot> i'm on a mac for christs sake
[0:07] <ZaxKellens> furrot : It was working, it wasn't, I'm not complaining about it, it's probably something with my java or computer
[0:07] <ZaxKellens> But I dunno wtf coulda caused it to start goin in the crapper
[0:07] <furrot> my problem is really big spikes when the game realizes it needs to learn something new
[0:07] <zeroZshadow> so, anyone made something cool yet with the water ?
[0:07] <furrot> like first time I break a water block or kill a creeper <- real fun
[0:07] <Azathoth> my problem is really big penises

[0:09] <outsomnia|> hmm

[0:21] <Azathoth> medal of horror!
[0:21] * outsomnia| uses dynamite to mine coal
[0:21] <LordQuorad> I prefer the natural look, to an extent
[0:21] <Kokopure> in my current world, though
[0:21] <Kokopure> it's very scarce.
[0:21] <ZaxKellens> Crazy AWESOME <.<
[0:21] <Azathoth> fuck it. i'm going to make a WW2 fps where you play as a german soldier
[0:21] <Kokopure> haha
[0:21] <outsomnia|> How about you just make an FPS, but not of the WW2 era?
[0:21] <Kokopure> screw that, make a Gulf War FPS
[0:21] <Azathoth> NOPE
[0:21] <outsomnia|> It'll be new and original.
[0:22] <Vicrry> Is it normal to have plenty of stone/cobblestone, be crazy short on wood, and building outside but still out of space? :P
[0:22] <Kokopure> where you play as an insurgent
[0:22] <bildramer> needs more WWIII FPSs
[0:22] <sppt> Azathoth, make a fps, with MW2's airport stage, only difference being that the map takes place in america
[0:22] <sppt> do it for lulz
[0:22] <Snowman> Let's make a Cold War FPS
[0:22] <Azathoth> will do
[0:22] <ZaxKellens> D&D
[0:22] <ZaxKellens> .. vurtual must be dead
[0:22] <outsomnia|> Make an FPS where you play as a normal everyday traffic cop.
[0:22] <Azathoth> lol
[0:22] <Azathoth> a cold war fps?
[0:22] <gdude2002|away> wtf is this world coming to
[0:22] <gdude2002|away> http://www.independent.ie/national-news/playground-shag-bands-spark-fears-over-early-sexualisation-2219003.html
[0:23] <Azathoth> that would be exciting. you spend the entire game training for a war that will never happen
[0:23] <bildramer> "Do you think North Korea will edit the world cup and tell the population that they won?"
[0:23] <outsomnia|> Haven't people been complaining about such things since the dark ages?
[0:23] <bildramer> lol
[0:23] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.71.225) has joined #minecraft

[0:23] <outsomnia|> No, just a traffic cop.
[0:23] <bildramer> make a WWIV one
[0:23] <bildramer> :D
[0:23] <Azathoth> and it isn't your everyday shooter where you just kill all the bad guys. it would focus a lot on ROE, saving hostages, taking bad guys alive, etc.
[0:23] <bildramer> sticks and stones etc.

[0:38] <vurtual> But still nogames
[0:38] <Azathoth> i bet GT5 is exactly the same as 4, but with better graphics and some more licensed cars
[0:38] <revenant> GT5 can NEVER be finished.
[0:38] <sppt> bildramer, golden sun was pretty much like those old snes games
[0:38] <Azathoth> how exciting
[0:38] <ZaxKellens|Away> Yeah, I look straight down and I get 35+ FPS, but I look up or horizontal and I get 2-7, any clue WHY?
[0:38] <bildramer> really, wtf
[0:38] <revenant> golden sun was pretty much the best RPG we've gotten in... 10 years.
[0:39] <TkTech> ZaxKellens|Away: a lot of tree's around?
[0:39] * Cial (chatzilla@209-42-181-47.wispnet.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:39] <sppt> ZaxKellens|Away, did you set graphics to fast
[0:39] <revenant> It had an amazing plot, great gameplay
[0:39] <Gunmage> Zax, your fps is down, then up, then down again, like an altihmers patient on a stair lift.
[0:39] <Vicrry> GT5 - there hasn't been a more fail development process ever. If you have to release the demo/preview as it's own game to fund the rest of development, you has a issue

[0:39] <sppt> revenant, i agree, it had EVERYTHING

[0:39] <sppt> i loved it so much
[0:39] <revenant> Same.
[0:39] <revenant> I still have the catridges.
[0:39] <bildramer> that's too fast
[0:39] <ZaxKellens|Away> No trees, graphics fast, render tiny
[0:39] <sppt> the music, the animation, the story, everything
[0:39] <revenant> Took 10 hours writing in the passwords.
[0:39] <revenant> I know.
[0:39] <vurtual> now too bad these aren't the graphics
[0:39] <TkTech> ZaxKellens|Away: odd
[0:39] <revenant> Alex was sadly downplayed

[0:41] <sppt> bildramer, why dont you go play golden sun 1 and 2
[0:41] <revenant> I'm so dead.
[0:41] <Drewseph> Sony wins this e3 at showing off new games

[0:41] <revenant> def
[0:42] <revenant> but Nintendo is winning overall.
[0:42] <Drewseph> but they are all sequels of the same kind of gameplay
[0:42] <bildramer> lol...
[0:42] <Drewseph> STALE
[0:42] <revenant> If they show a PSP2 tho
[0:42] <Drewseph> boring

[0:42] <bildramer> holy shit
[0:42] <TkTech|Busy> bildramer: No, there were C compilers
[0:42] <TkTech|Busy> but most things like effects were pure assembly
[0:42] <ZaxKellens|Away> You stink, you were supposed to flip out
[0:43] <Kodaichi> okay. Who here wanted buckets so badly that Notch had to psychically pick up on it?
[0:43] <TkTech|Busy> lots of titles were pure asm
[0:43] <Dragoon> Not me
[0:43] <revenant> Most early 3D games were asm
[0:43] <Drewseph> i was hpoing the last guardian would have been the surprise

[0:48] <LordQuorad> looks awesome
[0:49] <LordQuorad> i need to find myself some lava too
[0:49] <TkTech|Busy> bildramer: because at the time no compiler was smart enough to produce code as compact or efficient as a human could
[0:49] <Kokopure> :3
[0:49] <TkTech|Busy> remember the resources on the SNES were very limited
[0:49] <Kokopure> I am so happy with this liquid physics

[0:50] <TkTech|Busy> ....no
[0:50] <Gunmage> Wow you know I take back what I said
[0:50] <sppt> snes was cartridge based
[0:50] <TkTech|Busy> ^
[0:50] <Gunmage> This new twisted metal looks ok
[0:50] <revenant> yeah.
[0:50] <TkTech|Busy> The cartridges were custom built
[0:50] <bildramer> no shit sherlock
[0:50] <TkTech|Busy> they included the hardware needed to run the game
[0:50] <revenant> Oh, so devs could put stuff in there.
[0:50] <revenant> mmk.
[0:50] <TkTech|Busy> Most cartridges included custom effect chips and such
[0:50] <revenant> heh
[0:50] <sppt> i love cartridge based consoles, since you can expand the console by using custom cartridges
[0:50] <bildramer> heh
[0:50] <TkTech|Busy> ^
[0:50] <revenant> yeah :\

[2:51] <Kokopure> it's not... just dig down >.>
[2:51] <Kokopure> ... forever
[2:51] <AotC> Kokopure, 10 stone pickaxes later >_>
[2:51] <Kokopure> haha
[2:51] <Kokopure> seriously?
[2:51] <AotC> 4-5
[2:51] <Kokopure> I get to the center of the earth after about five
[2:51] <Kokopure> okay
[2:51] <Dman757> I don't like this water
[2:51] <Kokopure> oh
[2:51] <Kokopure> and make sure
[2:51] <Kokopure> you're going two at a time.
[2:51] <AotC> two at a time?
[2:52] <Kokopure> like...
[2:52] <Kokopure> you're standing on one brick while breaking another.
[2:52] <AotC> yeah :D
[2:52] <Kokopure> it's no good finding the center of the earth if you fry yourself once you get there ~_~
[2:52] * Kokopure learned this the hard way.
[2:52] <Kokopure> lost 64 torches and ladders.
[2:53] <AotC> and there it is
[2:53] <AotC> not using ladders :(
[2:53] <AotC> not enough wood for a ladder to the center
[2:53] <AotC> 3 buckets of lava :D
[2:53] <Kokopure> ...
[2:53] <Kokopure> AotC
[2:53] <Kokopure> how are you getting back up
[2:53] <AotC> ?
[2:53] <Kokopure> pillar jumping?
[2:53] <AotC> i didn't dig straight down :p
[2:53] <Kokopure> ahhhh
[2:54] <wolf_alex> ladders?
[2:54] <Kokopure> well that's why it took you so long!
[2:54] <Kokopure> S = stick, A = air
[2:54] <Kokopure> SAS
[2:54] <Kokopure> SSS
[2:54] <Kokopure> SAS
[2:54] <Kokopure> to give you an idea of how many ladders you can make...
[2:55] <Kokopure> 64 Wood pieces will eventually craft you 64 ladders with 64 sticks left over.
[2:55] <Kokopure> so cut down those trees.
[2:55] <Kokopure> one piece of wood is enough to make one ladder with one stick left over.
[2:55] <AotC> o_O
[2:55] <Kokopure> one piece of wood = four planks
[2:55] <Kokopure> four planks = eight sticks
[2:56] <Kokopure> and a ladder requires seven sticks.

[3:11] <darkedone02> i think only the maker of wurm online will do something like that.
[3:11] <Shadox> why would anyone like that update :(
[3:11] <Varriount> ... Perry Lanterns?
[3:11] <Perry> The point of torches is to give light in places you NEED LIGHT

[3:57] <Cyrex> I hated those trees
[3:57] <emp> i could upload the save if anyone wants it
[3:57] <Pure> Yeah my main save has those lol. I agree they looked bad.
[3:57] <Cyrex> so hard to get those branches
[3:57] <emp> not much explored tho
[3:57] <Cyrex> so what's the infdev editor called
[3:57] <emp> the branches dont look good without the thick trunks
[3:57] <Pure> How big is everyone's save?
[3:57] <emp> 2-4mb

[3:58] <SireTRM> I might have passed 1.5MB
[3:58] <Kokopure> I explored the whole island.
[3:58] <cynicalAlchemist> I find it strange that water disappears once you get rid of the original source.
[3:58] <Pure> Mine is 6
[3:58] <Pure> yeah
[3:58] <Kokopure> Cynical, why?
[3:58] <SireTRM> cynicalAlchemist, it flows away.
[3:58] <Kokopure> if you stop a stream, the rest doesn't keep going.
[3:58] <Kokopure> if all the water is coming from that one block, it makes sense that when the block is gone the water stops flowing.
[3:58] <cynicalAlchemist> Also checking mine. 3.68 gbs
[3:58] <Pure> I can really kinda see both arguments
[3:58] <cynicalAlchemist> I guess so.
[3:58] <Kokopure> however, Lava doesn't work the same way
[3:58] <Kokopure> which is frustrating to no end
[3:58] <Kokopure> :|
[3:59] <Pure> lol I know you gotta just cover it
[3:59] <Kokopure> well
[3:59] <Kokopure> you can cover every other tile
[3:59] <Kokopure> and it'll still go away

[5:00] <Masshuu> so in a sence, water makes sence if you apply minecraft logic to it
[5:00] <AA> I did make an awesome waterfall though
[5:00] <Naxza> Hurray for glass towers.
[5:01] <vede> Augh overuse of the word "sense" misspelled too!
[5:01] * vede raeg
[5:01] <Kokopure> I carry two buckets of water and two buckets of lava everywhere I go
[5:01] <Masshuu> i love driving people nuts with my spelling
[5:01] <Kokopure> so I have infinite lava and water :3
[5:01] <Masshuu> how "bugged" is lava
[5:01] <LG_Legacy> Bugged
[5:01] <Kokopure> well
[5:02] <vede> "bugged"
[5:02] <Kokopure> it's not unusably bugged, but there are some definite bugs.
[5:02] <Masshuu> like, it just sits there and doesn't moove buged
[5:02] <Kokopure> eh?
[5:02] <Kokopure> since when doesn't it move?
[5:02] <Masshuu> or ir will kill us all buged
[5:02] <vede> I'm just gonna go back to coding. I can tell me being here will just result in me shouting at people.
[5:02] <Kokopure> neither, Masshuu
[5:02] <Kokopure> like
[5:02] <Kokopure> example
[5:02] <Kokopure> it doesn't behave like water behaves.
[5:02] <Kokopure> with water, all extra water flows from the base block.
[5:02] <Kokopure> so when you remove the base water block, the rest of the water drains away and is gone.
[5:03] <Naxza> Is anyone else surprised how well water works for its first day out?
[5:03] <Kokopure> with lava, if you remove the base lava...
[5:03] <Kokopure> the rest of the lava still sticks around.
[5:03] <Masshuu> you die
[5:03] <Kokopure> Naxza, I am
[5:03] <Kokopure> I'm in love with the system
[5:03] <Kokopure> really all it needs is tweaks
[5:03] <Kokopure> I think water putting out torches is fine
[5:03] <Kokopure> I'm less enthused about it putting out ladders
[5:03] <Naxza> And the stuff is just so darn handy.
[5:03] <Kokopure> oh yes.

[5:16] <slowriot> who the fuck said it's bad
[5:16] <slowriot> it's an excellent game
[5:16] <slowriot> but it's nothing to daggerfall, in depth and feel
[5:16] <Visiiri> <slowriot> morrowind was for sissies who like polygons and shit
[5:16] <Shadox> Pure
[5:16] <slowriot> game size is not even comparable

[5:16] <Naxza> /rabidfan
[5:16] <slowriot> sigh
[5:16] <sorre> 'game size' doesn't mean a whole lot when most of the game is completely flat and featureless
[5:16] <vurtual> 10:18 now
[5:16] <slowriot> it's well featureful!
[5:17] <slowriot> but yeah, i agree... they both have merits and demerits
[5:17] <slowriot> but visiiri has obviously never played daggerfall at all
[5:17] <Visiiri> sorre: Except for the amazing amount of quests, deep lore, content focus, and intense scenes?
[5:17] <slowriot> or he wouldn't be coming out with stupid stuff like that
[5:17] <Naxza> Morrowind has an engrossing story that envelops you in lore, something neither Daggerfall or Oblivion did for me.
[5:17] <liq3> Visiiri: Don't forget the crazy fast mages of doom.
[5:17] <slowriot> oblivion had that missing for sure
[5:17] <Visiiri> Naxza is right.
[5:17] <slowriot> but daggerfall had massive depth
[5:17] <vurtual> I'm at the target house, "woodton residence"
[5:18] <slowriot> all the subtle hidden stuff you wouldn't come across til months of play time
[5:18] <Visiiri> How to have fun in oblivion: Soul trap a mage and sell the gem to the mages guild.
[5:18] <vurtual> I spent 3 more hours
[5:18] <liq3> Visiiri: LOL.
[5:18] <vurtual> still locked
[5:18] <slowriot> vurtual: is there an upstairs door?
[5:18] * vurtual scans for doors
[5:18] <vurtual> "upstairs"?
[5:18] <Naxza> Bash bash bash bash.
[5:18] <slowriot> some houes are kind of stairs shaped with a balcony
[5:18] <Kokopure> I just aqueduct'd myself some ham from like a hill away
[5:18] <Kokopure> O_O
[5:18] <Naxza> As long as you don't get attacked by a guard, the crime doesn't stick.
[5:18] <slowriot> omg, aqueducts...
[5:18] <slowriot> conveyor belts
[5:18] <Kokopure> it just floats right to me!
[5:18] <slowriot> that's a marvellous idea
[5:18] <vurtual> no, just one door
[5:18] <Kokopure> I know!
[5:18] <Kokopure> you could mine far far away
[5:18] <Kokopure> and flot the stuff back to town
[5:19] <Kokopure> float*
[5:19] <Visiiri> There was a major flaw with oblivion.
[5:19] <Naxza> Bash bash bash the door.
[5:19] <slowriot> need lifts though

[5:19] <slowriot> or a fountain \o/
[5:19] <Kokopure> but
[5:19] <Visiiri> All you had to do was TALK to a guard and you'd be caught with stolen goods
[5:19] <vurtual> THIS IS THE FIGHTER'S GUILD WE ARE GOING TO SLAY YOU GRIZZLY BEAR
[5:19] <Kokopure> it only needs to slope 1 block down every four.
[5:19] <Visiiri> I was the theives guild master and had completed all of the dark brotherhood quests
[5:19] <Visiiri> Doesn't mean I don't need to ask for directions sometimes :|
[5:19] <Naxza> Yeah. Nothing says Oblivion like being forced to turn over stolen goods when you so much as look at a guar.
[5:19] <Naxza> And get this.
[5:20] <Visiiri> And it doesn't have the "Since you turned yourself in..."
[5:20] * LG_Legacy uploads
[5:20] <Visiiri> I really liked that
[5:20] <Naxza> I snuck into someone's house, nobody saw me, and a guard pops up from out of nowhere and fries me for trespassing when he's trespassing RIGHT THERE WITH ME.
[5:20] <Annihilator> your stolen goods are telepathically transferred to the guard standing 10 feet below you
[5:20] <liq3> He's allowed to...

[5:20] <Visiiri> hahaha, Naxza, i hate that

[5:20] <LG_Legacy> http://img1.uploadscreenshot.com/images/orig/6/16521201216-orig.jpg
[5:20] <Naxza> And then he arrests you, makes you pay the fine, steals your goods, wastes your time, and sticks you in front of the Imperial Palace.
[5:20] <Naxza> =|
[5:21] <Visiiri> I'd punch the guy in the cells
[5:21] <Visiiri> Then the guard attacks HIM
[5:21] <Visiiri> opens the door for you
[5:21] <Annihilator> the guards are criminal, admit it
[5:21] <Visiiri> you walk out
[5:21] <liq3> lol erally?
[5:21] <Annihilator> they hoard the stolen goods for themselves
[5:21] <Visiiri> mhm
[5:21] <maushu> Guards don't trespass. They hunt trespassers by any means necessary. TO THE DEATH.
[5:21] <Visiiri> and you only have to pick the 'confenscated stuffs' chest once
[5:21] <Naxza> They have a chest marked "evidence" with all of YOUR stolen stolen stuff in it.
[5:21] <Annihilator> and then they take it all away
[5:21] <Visiiri> ^ that chest
[5:22] <liq3> Oblivion never had anything good to steal. :(
[5:22] <maushu> LG_Legacy, oooh man, I so wanted that place.
[5:22] <Annihilator> melons are a good steal
[5:22] <Visiiri> liq3: Morrowind owned it there, too
[5:22] <Visiiri> I sucked at morrowind because of the puzzle box quest
[5:22] <liq3> Morrowind has those vaults in Vivic... the house ones. Which had TONS of shit to steal.
[5:22] <Visiiri> I gave up
[5:22] <Naxza> On my last playthrough of Morrowind, I wasn't even aware guards were taking stuff from me until I picked open the Evidence box and saw a ton of stuff.
[5:22] <Visiiri> so I walked around stealing stuf
[5:22] <vurtual> anyways
[5:22] <Visiiri> I even stole a slave one time
[5:22] <vurtual> I launched the bear into the netherverse
[5:22] <vurtual> ...
[5:22] <vurtual> so I can't attack the bear
[5:22] <AA> If Notch logs in some one be sure to tell him about the water killing ladders
[5:22] <vurtual> and I can't leave, there are guards
[5:22] <Visiiri> took him to balmora
[5:22] <Visiiri> and killed him
[5:22] <AA> Bye!
[5:22] <vurtual> I can't rest, the bear is nearby
[5:23] <Naxza> Vurt- reload.

[5:24] <LG_Legacy> Ah
[5:24] <LG_Legacy> Wow the endgame music for MW2 really fits KF
[5:24] <vurtual> so guys
[5:24] <vurtual> without tryign to reload
[5:24] <vurtual> should I try running out
[5:24] <vurtual> then back in?
[5:24] <vurtual> Or will the guards catch me by automatic
[5:24] <vurtual> can I resist then jump back in?
[5:25] <gear> finally preordered my iphone
[5:25] <gear> WOOP
[5:25] <vurtual> well I'll reload EITHER WAY
[5:25] <Naxza> Vurt, I think the bear was really, really stuck down there.
[5:25] <vurtual> AHAHAHAHA
[5:25] <vurtual> THE BEAR
[5:25] <Naxza> The void eats all.
[5:25] <vurtual> IS IN THE CEILING
[5:26] <vurtual> THE BEAR IS IN THE CEILING
[5:26] <vurtual> I CAN SEE THE FEET
[5:26] <Naxza> HACK HACK HACKANDSLASH.
[5:26] <slowriot> vurtual: try the attic...
[5:26] <slowriot> you ascend ladders/trap doors by clicking them istr, it's non-obvious
[5:26] <liq3> wow... I'm like 5km (yes, 5000 blocks), from the start point in my current world.
[5:26] <Visiiri> Hey, are there any good skin makers here?
[5:27] <liq3> and that's assuming a straight line. o.o
[5:27] <vurtual> shot him in the bow
[5:27] <Naxza> Note to self- Iron can usually be found under sandpits, it seems.
[5:27] <vurtual> no, I was in the attic
[5:27] <vurtual> I had knocked the bear up literally into the ceiling
[5:27] <vurtual> the angled ceiling
[5:27] <slowriot> oh...
[5:27] <slowriot> yeah the angled bits... they... bug a bit
[5:27] <vurtual> so I shot him with my elven longbow and succeeded
[5:27] <slowriot> be careful with those, you can get stuck in places like that
[5:27] <vurtual> TIME TO FLEE PAST GUARDS AND HIDE IN THE FIGHTER GUILD
[5:27] <vurtual> THEN RUN BACK OUT AND CRY
[5:27] <slowriot> lulz
[5:28] <vurtual> almost made a void ranger out of that bear
[5:28] <vurtual> but now he's.. a ceiling corpse

[5:46] <Kodaichi> hello.
[5:46] <Cyrex> then you can see if you're on the right layer
[5:46] <Visiiri> Play L4D2 with me and dysgalt
[5:46] <Kodaichi> is this urgent?
[5:46] <Visiiri> Iguana, you too.
[5:46] <Naxza> Visiiri- What're you planning on doing?

[5:46] <Kodaichi> oh FINE
[5:46] <Visiiri> Versus
[5:46] <Naxza> I meant campaign/st00f
[5:46] <Masshuu> thats what i'm doing, and so i'm sure im looking at the wrong chunk or layer

[5:50] <Naxza> That's only if you've got really high speed/athletics.

[5:50] <Naxza> Besides, a horse costs 1K.
[5:51] <vurtual> and iron plate sells for a lot
[5:52] <Cyrex> I has a bucket of lava
[5:52] <Logarith> Heck yes.
[5:52] <Cyrex> what should I do with it that isn't just destroy random stuff
[5:52] <Logarith> Actually, lava sources are pretty annoying I've found.
[5:52] <Cyrex> thinking of making a lava waterfall
[5:52] <Logarith> Once you take away the source, the rest of the lava doesn't go away like with water.
[5:52] <Cyrex> ohshit
[5:52] <Cyrex> really?
[5:52] <Logarith> Yeah.
[5:52] <Cyrex> how do you get rid of it then
[5:52] <Logarith> Really friggin' annoying.
[5:53] <LuciferZ> Omg what if eventually
[5:53] <Logarith> You can't. You have to build over it to remove the lava.
[5:53] <Logarith> >.<
[5:53] <LuciferZ> That remaining lava hardens
[5:53] <vurtual> is lava genned into the map?
[5:53] <LuciferZ> Into sloped stone
[5:53] <vurtual> Or do you have to seek the mapbottoms?
[5:53] <Logarith> :O
[5:53] <Logarith> Seek the bottom.
[5:53] <vurtual> ok
[5:53] <LuciferZ> Smooth. Minecraft. Holy shit.

[5:53] <Logarith> I doubt it.

[5:53] <Logarith> Sloped stone...
[5:53] <Cyrex> lava already spews fireballs

[5:54] <Logarith> The new system is quite buggy, but still really fun.
[5:54] <vurtual> Sometimes the inventory pane doesn't have items aligned properly
[5:54] <Logarith> Have you made a water tree yet?
[5:54] <IDTL> Woo flowing water
[5:54] <vurtual> like mysteriously nipple-revealing clothing, or having encompassing armor have clothing poking out
[5:54] <Cial> water tree?
[5:54] <outsomnia> I love water trees
[5:55] <vurtual> or something going over your chin
[5:55] <vede> The current system makes absolutely no sense at all, but it's workable.
[5:55] <Cyrex> how do you people do airlocks after the patch
[5:55] <IDTL> i didn't even know his engine was capable of doors and water stuff like this
[5:55] <Cial> what is water tree?
[5:55] <outsomnia> The old-fashioned way.
[5:55] <Cyrex> since it's sometimes really low and doesn't hit the thing
[5:55] <Logarith> Yups.
[5:55] <vede> The biggest problem is that water doesn't flow over water.
[5:55] <Logarith> Water source on top of tree == water tree.
[5:55] <Logarith> Looks really cool.
[5:55] <vede> Which means that you can pretty much make big hills and mountains of water that do nothing.
[5:55] <Cial> oh
[5:55] <Dragoon> With the addition of buckets, I just thought of a good idea: Wells
[5:55] <Logarith> Oh, and water doesn't extinguish fire anymore.
[5:55] <outsomnia> They're awesome to look at and good markers.
[5:56] <Logarith> So you can make a water tree and set it on fire and it stays that way. O.o
[5:56] <outsomnia> Wells don't really seem so neccessary though.
[5:56] <LuciferZ> whoaaaaa
[5:56] <Logarith> I've heard of people making wells already.
[5:56] <Cyrex> damnit I have three furnaces working overtime and it's still slow as hell
[5:56] <LuciferZ> Actually guys what you should be considering
[5:56] <Dragoon> Just so you could get water easier
[5:56] <LuciferZ> It conveyor belts
[5:56] <Logarith> I have a floating island that I put a waterfall on. :)
[5:56] <outsomnia> [W][h][W]
[5:56] <outsomnia> w= filled water, h= half-filled water
[5:56] <outsomnia> the middle block will fill and refill each time you remove it
[5:57] <Logarith> You can't remove half-water, can you?
[5:57] <outsomnia> Nope
[5:57] <LuciferZ> Water pushes things downhill, so make a waterblock that pushes things uphill.
[5:57] * cynicalAlchemist is now known as cA|Knaelidos
[5:57] <LuciferZ> Skin it to look like a conveyor belt.
[5:57] <Dragoon> Like, you'd set up the well, like...a well, and have the water come in the ocean from underground
[5:57] <Logarith> Hahaha. Dont think that's natural.
[5:57] <Logarith> And you can't skin water.
[5:57] <Logarith> :(
[5:57] <Naxza> CCCCRRRRAAAAAAAAA
[5:57] <Dragoon> Also we should be able to place bukkits
[5:57] <LuciferZ> No I mean Notch should, lol
[5:57] <Logarith> Why?
[5:57] <Naxza> There goes my watervator.
[5:57] * Varriount (varriount@pool-96-255-204-117.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:57] <Cyrex> so how do you make your airlocks
[5:57] <outsomnia> I don't think notch has implemented water pressure yet dragoon.
[5:57] <Logarith> Watervators still work.
[5:58] <vurtual> this horse isn't much faster than me running :|
[5:58] <LuciferZ> Placing a bucket of lava would be an awesome light.
[5:58] <Naxza> Good thing I had an extra blob of water. Dx
[5:58] <Logarith> Just swim up a vertical waterfall.
[5:58] <Naxza> Vurt, you assumed I knew your speed.
[5:58] <Logarith> I was thinking bucket of lava == holdable light source?
[5:58] <Logarith> Lantern?
[5:58] <Budda> whats the combo for bucket
[5:58] <Dragoon> No, leesen, The water flow in from an underground aqueduct to the well
[5:58] <LG_Legacy> Wouldn't the lava melt through the bucket?
[5:58] <LuciferZ> Bowl of iron ingots, Budda
[5:58] <Logarith> Same as bowl, but with iron bars.
[5:58] <Logarith> Yah.
[5:58] <Budda> ...
[5:58] <outsomnia> what
[5:58] <LuciferZ> Not through iron, LG
[5:59] <Budda> i want wooden buckets
[5:59] <outsomnia> if it's a MAGIC bucket?
[5:59] <LG_Legacy> It's fucking lava
[5:59] <Cyrex> omnomnom tasty lava
[5:59] <Logarith> They have those. They're called bowls.
[5:59] <LG_Legacy> It's extremely high tempatures
[5:59] <Dragoon> GAME
[5:59] <outsomnia> Better yet @ the elevators, situate yourself halfway in the vertical water stream and swim up, you'll still be able to breath.
[5:59] <Logarith> FDSFJDSLKS
[5:59] <LuciferZ> Can't they make crucibles out of iron?
[5:59] <vurtual> but it is faster than me strafing
[5:59] <Logarith> I just lost the game...
[5:59] <Dragoon> GAME > REALITY.
[5:59] <vurtual> and I'm not exhausting myself
[5:59] <vurtual> so there
[5:59] <LG_Legacy> In our minds

[5:59] <Logarith> Also, lava isn't nearly as deadly anymore, anyone notice that?
[6:00] <vurtual> how do you make "spring" blocks exactly
[6:00] <Logarith> Every time you touch it, only half a heart gets taken off.
[6:00] <vurtual> yes that's how lava works
[6:00] <LuciferZ> Nice house, EMP
[6:00] <vurtual> but it touches you a lot
[6:00] <LuciferZ> I like the chimney.

[6:00] <vurtual> Another upside of horse: Unlike cart-horse who won't shut up, this one is relatively quiet
[6:00] <vurtual> "ocean"
[6:00] <Logarith> I want to make a lava-based fireplace.
[6:01] <vurtual> There are OCEANS now?
[6:01] <Logarith> Sooo much cooler than torches.
[6:01] <cA|Knaelidos> That would be pretty cool
[6:01] <outsomnia> [18:59] <Logarith> bucket >> pick up ocean
[6:01] <Logarith> Yeah, islands and oceans.
[6:01] <outsomnia> ARE YOU POSEIDON?!

[6:01] <LG_Legacy> RELEASE THE KRAKEN
[6:01] <outsomnia> All hail Poseidon!!
[6:01] <Logarith> And no. The kraken is mine.

[6:01] <emp> streaman it if anyone wants to see lava fireplace
[6:01] <outsomnia> u ded
[6:01] <Dragoon> Does the smoke from the fireplace float out of the chimeny? :D
[6:02] <emp> yes
[6:02] <Dragoon> Link, kthx
[6:02] <emp> but my chimney is rlly tall
[6:02] <Logarith> Yups.
[6:02] <emp> not sure if it does anymore
[6:02] <emp> i needa check
[6:02] <Logarith> About smoke: depends on height.
[6:02] <vurtual> the game crashed on save ;_;
[6:02] <Dragoon> I have a small house with a small fireplace, but it has an awesome mantle
[6:02] <Naxza> Your horse is quiet? I get three neighs all at the same time or in rapid succession at regular intervals on Daggerfall. X_x
[6:02] <vurtual> I do too, naxza
[6:02] <vurtual> just with the cart
[6:03] <LuciferZ> Oops forgot to quit before closing infdev

[6:03] <outsomnia> D&D
[6:03] <vurtual> minecrafft mob duh
[6:03] <outsomnia> OR that
[6:03] <emp> notch just implemented horses
[6:03] <vurtual> Daggerfall
[6:03] <vurtual> the playable world in minecraft
[6:03] <Dragoon> :P
[6:03] <vurtual> you have to craft a way to get there, but then it acts as an extra save slot
[6:04] <outsomnia> Just watch out for Dwemers.

[6:04] <Shadox> Pure
[6:04] <Logarith> Oh... Fun.
[6:04] <Masshuu> So i might be wrong about this, but i figured the infdev map files work like this, they are placed in the world based on their xPos and zPos,
[6:04] <Shadox> its gamingstream, right?
[6:04] <vurtual> there are towns, cities, and guards and stuff
[6:04] <emp> just went to bottom of my cave to mine for lava and i forgot my torches...
[6:04] <Logarith> XD
[6:04] <Dragoon> The guards go "HALT HALT HALT HALT"
[6:04] <outsomnia> Grab some lava, use that for lighting.
[6:04] <vurtual> I am deeply unsettled at the normal mc though
[6:04] <vurtual> the run speed is slow
[6:04] <vurtual> and I can't sprint
[6:04] <Logarith> It's intense
[6:04] <outsomnia> The normal MC?
[6:05] <outsomnia> The MC of P4 or P3?
[6:05] <Logarith> Why do you play old MC?
[6:05] <vurtual> as in infde
[6:05] <vurtual> v
[6:05] <Masshuu> So a player at 100, 100, 50, would be on chunk 6, 6, at tile 4, 4, 50 on that chunk
[6:05] <outsomnia> Ah
[6:05] <vurtual> outside of the daggerfall bonus world
[6:05] <outsomnia> P5 then.
[6:05] <outsomnia> How do you have a 3DS already?
[6:05] <Logarith> Aaaaah. Gots it.
[6:06] <IDTL> indev is pretty solid as far as gameplay goes
[6:06] <IDTL> but infdev has the features
[6:06] <IDTL> doors, buckets, signs, etc
[6:06] <liq3> lol...
[6:06] <liq3> what's funny is that MC'ers are constantly running at 14km/ph.
[6:06] <liq3> :P

[6:06] <IDTL> 2/3 day 1/3 night
[6:06] <Logarith> I think it's 2:1
[6:06] <liq3> still 7m30s for both afiak.
[6:06] <liq3> what?
[6:07] <Logarith> Day is twice as long.
[6:07] * Predobear (DickNipple@dsl-217-155-16-102.zen.co.uk) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[6:07] <Logarith> as night.
[6:07] <Logarith> PREDOBEAR!
[6:07] <outsomnia> Delicious updates.
[6:07] <liq3> when did this happen?
[6:07] <outsomnia> Check the 'site.
[6:07] <liq3> what site?
[6:07] <Bucashi> I liked night.
[6:07] <Bucashi> why is everyone so excited about the new water?
[6:07] <emp> aww yea, bucket full of lava
[6:08] <LuciferZ> Because it's fucking ballin'
[6:08] <Bucashi> It's terrible.
[6:08] <Dragoon> Someone should really make a house of doors
[6:08] <Bucashi> I liked the old indev water better.
[6:08] <LuciferZ> The infite/evaporating water?
[6:08] <Bucashi> yes.
[6:08] <LuciferZ> Why?
[6:08] <Bucashi> it's better than puddles.
[6:08] <Bucashi> it works like real water.
[6:08] <Logarith> It's friggin' amazing.
[6:08] <Logarith> Well, kinda.
[6:08] <LuciferZ> Except giant cubic meters of it
[6:08] <Logarith> It's still a wee bit glitchy.
[6:08] <LuciferZ> That magically disappear
[6:08] <Logarith> But isn't everything. :P
[6:08] <LuciferZ> Sometimes
[6:09] <Bucashi> it's not in any way like a real fluid.
[6:09] <outsomnia> liq3 http://notch.tumblr.com/
[6:09] <LuciferZ> Neither way the old stuff
[6:09] <Bucashi> notch should just make water work like it does in dorf fort.
[6:09] <Budda> yeah...i made a line of water from the sea into land...and it gets lower...
[6:09] <Budda> that shouldnt happen
[6:09] <liq3> could swear that wasn't there before!
[6:09] * Varriount (varriount@pool-96-255-204-117.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[6:09] <Logarith> It really isn't like real water....
[6:09] <LuciferZ> Before, though, if you did that in infdev, water wouldn't flow.
[6:09] <emp> i now have a lava fire place
[6:09] <Bucashi> water basically works like a torch illuminates.
[6:09] <emp> awwwwww yeaaaaaaa
[6:09] <LuciferZ> If you did that in indev the ocean would evaporate
[6:09] <Logarith> That's true.
[6:09] <outsomnia> What should happen then?
[6:09] <Logarith> @emp - Nice!
[6:10] <Bucashi> I rather have buggy water that I can flood things with.
[6:10] <Logarith> It should fill up completely like in indev.
[6:10] <Budda> if its from the sea, it shouldnt go down
[6:10] <Budda> its that simple
[6:10] <Bucashi> instead of pseudo flows.
[6:10] <LuciferZ> I'd rather have waterfalls that work.
[6:10] <Logarith> I don't mind the indev water scheme.
[6:10] * atung323 (Mibbit@cpe-76-88-39-233.san.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[6:10] <LuciferZ> And beaches that push me to shore
[6:10] <vurtual> I liked the old indev water
[6:10] <atung323> i has a question really quick
[6:10] <vurtual> that flowed properly
[6:10] <Bucashi> yeah.
[6:10] <LuciferZ> And a water slide to the bottom of the map
[6:10] <vurtual> and could make waterfalls
[6:10] <outsomnia> Infinite water sure is cool, but screw y'all I want my buckets.
[6:10] <Bucashi> I'd have been happy with the killer infinite water vortices that notch mentioned.
[6:10] <Logarith> @atung323 What?
[6:10] <Bucashi> these just seem a cop out.
[6:10] <atung323> My friend's on the client, but he can't see the fps or chunk updates
[6:11] <vurtual> it's an option

[6:16] <Logarith> a.k.a 7
[6:16] <IDTL> There should be an option in the menu just for clouds

[6:17] <Cial> yea i think i would get better FPS with the old ones
[6:17] <IDTL> I know the current graphics option does that

[6:19] <IDTL> I know
[6:19] <IDTL> I had a sky base
[6:19] <IDTL> and I couldn't see shit
[6:19] <Wervyn> Heh, the new water is kind of hilarious.
[6:19] <LuciferZ> I haven't tested, but do new clouds go through walls too?
[6:19] <IDTL> probably
[6:19] <Logarith> I bet that having the low graphics turn off lava animation would really help.
[6:20] <LuciferZ> If he can get them to not do that
[6:20] <Logarith> In some situations, that is.
[6:20] <LuciferZ> I will love those clouds.
[6:20] <IDTL> I always thought very rare meteors would be cool
[6:20] <Wervyn> Pretty, but not very useful. Though you'll never have to worry about flooding again this way..
[6:20] <IDTL> They crash making the screen shake and make a big pit
[6:20] <IDTL> and they could have some very rare glowing material that's better than diamond
[6:20] <IDTL> or something
[6:20] <vurtual> so now Daggerfall has inspired me to create a house in the style of its homes
[6:21] <Logarith> Ooooh. That'd be sweet.
[6:21] <vurtual> I was gonna make it one floor and an attic, but now I think I could make a second floor....
[6:21] <vurtual> How many floors!?
[6:21] <vurtual> or have a second entrance into my attic
[6:21] <LuciferZ> Two floors and attic, Vurt.
[6:21] <vurtual> the attic is a floor-sized room though

[6:22] <Naxza> Noo.
[6:22] <Naxza> No hats.
[6:23] <LuciferZ> We have helmets though
[6:23] <LuciferZ> It makes sense.
[6:23] <vurtual> tailoring workshop-block, which lets you craft clothing items using various materials, depending on the pattern it producs a different item, and each bit of material you use in it gives you so much of a base color for the drawn design
[6:23] <vurtual> then use dyes to change the colors of it

[6:24] <IDTL> or paintings you can paint
[6:24] <Kokopure> I would like paintable signs :3
[6:24] <LuciferZ> I think there's a suggestion thread for that
[6:24] <Logarith> Paintable signs +1
[6:24] <vurtual> there should be little pouches, that act as really small chests.

[6:25] <Logarith> Oooh, another use for cloth. Pouches.
[6:25] <Logarith> Nice!
[6:25] <vurtual> and when a monster dies, they might drop a handful of items in one
[6:25] <Naxza> I want dragons and horses and machine guns and spaceships and the moon and aliens and dwarves and magic and science and computers and iPods.
[6:25] <Kokopure> I think some form of expandable backpack would be good
[6:25] <Kokopure> or
[6:25] <Kokopure> I would at least..
[6:25] <IDTL> I don't think there should really be currency
[6:25] <Kokopure> like some way of carting a full chest from one base to another.
[6:25] <Logarith> No money, I agree.
[6:25] <Kokopure> because that's a pain in the ass.
[6:25] <LuciferZ> Carts are "on his list" or something
[6:25] <Logarith> I agree about the backpack.
[6:25] <LuciferZ> Mobile chests
[6:25] <Duane> Currency will ruin itself unless there's more than one kind.
[6:25] <Kokopure> like
[6:25] <Duane> Hey, guys, quick question.
[6:26] <Logarith> To craft one, same arrangement as furnace, but with cloth?
[6:26] <Kokopure> maybe a backpack you can't open until you set it down
[6:26] <Naxza> There shouldn't be currency, since it'll have no real use.
[6:26] <Kokopure> that I would be fine with
[6:26] <Logarith> Duane: Yes?
[6:26] <Duane> Am I the only one who can't play Minecraft right now?
[6:26] <Naxza> Bartering makes more sense.
[6:26] <LG_Legacy> Yes
[6:26] <Wervyn> Yes.
[6:26] <Zaneo> Yeah
[6:26] <Logarith> No, I can play it fine.
[6:26] <LuciferZ> I actually play better now.
[6:26] <Logarith> Likewise.
[6:26] <IDTL> In wurm all I do is barter
[6:26] <IDTL> and it works great
[6:26] <LuciferZ> Not sure what changed
[6:26] <Kokopure> yeah
[6:26] <Duane> Yeah, It won't load for me. :\
[6:26] <vurtual> enemies with substantial amoutns of gear should leave a crumpled corpse made from their texture, containing all their items. So if a heavily armored skeleton were to die, you could loot their body of pouches of things, and any of their armor or equipment
[6:26] <Kokopure> if a currency emerges, let it emerge on its own.
[6:26] <LuciferZ> No way vurtual
[6:26] <LuciferZ> No looting
[6:26] <Wervyn> I'm not even sure there's going to be much place for bartering in the game, at this stage.
[6:26] <Kokopure> it's entirely possible we'll do the majority of our trading in smelted iron.
[6:26] <Logarith> I'm thinking diamonds would be used as currency if anything.
[6:26] <LuciferZ> Looting is such a cliche
[6:27] <Logarith> It's non-renewable.
[6:27] <Duane> Looting would be neat for like, random tombs and stuff.
[6:27] * TkTech|Busy is now known as TkTech
[6:27] <Kokopure> I think iron would be the currency
[6:27] <LuciferZ> Yeah, but not bodies
[6:27] <Duane> Like what Dwarf Fortress did with the Demon Fortresses underground.
[6:27] <Kokopure> because it's semi-rare and useful.
[6:27] <Logarith> Any metal theoretically.
[6:27] <LuciferZ> Finding chests in procedurally generated dungeons = awesome
[6:27] <Logarith> But not gold. God's idiotic.
[6:27] <Duane> You can't tell me you wouldn't like to mine into a smooth structure with bodies lying around.
[6:27] <Logarith> >.< GOLD is idiotic.
[6:27] <Kokopure> <Logarith> But not gold. God's idiotic. <-- haha
[6:27] <Logarith> My bad.
[6:27] <vurtual> I want to tame sheep and make them baa music.
[6:27] <Kokopure> I want to ride mobs :3
[6:27] <Logarith> That would be interesting...?
[6:27] <Kokopure> oh
[6:27] <vurtual> looting is "cliche" because it's so logical.
[6:27] <Kokopure> and
[6:27] <vurtual> A guy has died
[6:28] <vurtual> LET'S TAKE HIS STUFF
[6:28] <Logarith> And riding pigs would be great.
[6:28] <Kokopure> I made an aqueduct
[6:28] <Kokopure> and it works
[6:28] <Kokopure> :3
[6:28] <Naxza> Once gold has a real use, it won't be idiotic.
[6:28] <Duane> Really wish I could play. ;_;
[6:28] <vurtual> gold would end up being currency probably, for any large-scale trades
[6:28] <LuciferZ> It means more menus
[6:28] <Naxza> To disregard it now because it doesn't have a use yet is silly.
[6:28] <Duane> Anyone got a video of how the dynamic water looks?
[6:28] <Logarith> Right now it is simply because it has no use.
[6:28] <LuciferZ> And Notch hates menus apparently.
[6:28] <vurtual> You want 3000 chests of stone? gimme some gold for that
[6:28] <Logarith> No thank you.
[6:28] <Wervyn> The logistics of moving 3000 chests of stone aside...
[6:28] <Logarith> Oh can I bring up a big topic?
[6:28] <Duane> Notch should take something from Haven and Hearth and let us carry Chests, or at least Half-Chests, and walk at half-speed.
[6:29] <Kokopure> Logarith, what?
[6:29] <Duane> Go for it, Logarith.
[6:29] <Logarith> When Multiplayer comes out... NBTedit will have to die.
[6:29] <Kokopure> ?
[6:29] <Duane> YES.
[6:29] <IDTL> What could be some good uses for gold?
[6:29] <Kokopure> what's NBTedit?
[6:29] <Logarith> It will be pointless if people can cheat with that in multiplayer.
[6:29] <LuciferZ> Not really, Logarith
[6:29] <IDTL> Crowns?
[6:29] <Logarith> Lets you edit your inventory.
[6:29] <Naxza> Logarith- The map would be serverside, unmoddable by participants.
[6:29] <Kokopure> ahh
[6:29] <LuciferZ> The multiplayer save file will only be editable by the admin
[6:29] <Kokopure> there we go
[6:29] <Kokopure> I agree with that, Naxza
[6:29] <LuciferZ> And if the admin wants to cheat, that's his choice.
[6:29] <Logarith> Ah, good call. That makes sense.
[6:30] <Duane> Anyone know how I could get Minecraft to work?
[6:30] <vurtual> Notch should take something from <game I like> because <minecraft has almost no definign good features beyond "place blocks and pick them up">
[6:30] <Logarith> I forgot you can't keep a shared map on a local disk. ^__^;
[6:30] <Naxza> It's not a matter of agreement, it's how servers work.
[6:30] <Visiiri> LOL SHIT
[6:30] <Visiiri> I'M OUT OF COMPUTER MEMORY
[6:30] <Visiiri> I HAVE TO DUMP LOADS OF SHIT
[6:30] <Duane> I've tried two browsers and reinstalled Java a FEW times.
[6:30] <Logarith> Sorry, Duane.
[6:30] <Logarith> What is the problem precisely?
[6:30] <LuciferZ> Viiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis
[6:30] <Naxza> Duane, have you updated your display drivers?
[6:30] <Duane> Just a day or so ago.
[6:31] <Duane> I upgraded so I could play Haven and Hearth.
[6:31] <LuciferZ> veeseereee
[6:31] <Duane> I could play Minecraft fine before.
[6:31] <Duane> And after.
[6:31] <Duane> And now it goes to "Lighting" then crashes.
[6:31] <Kokopure> try emptying your cache
[6:31] <Logarith> ? That's strange.
[6:31] <Kokopure> or restarting your computer.
[6:32] <Logarith> You could try deleting all of your minecraft appdata too.
[6:32] <Kokopure> the .jar might have downloaded incorrectly.
[6:32] <Visiiri> win
[6:32] <IDTL> What about mining helmets?
[6:32] <Logarith> You are on infdev, right?
[6:32] <Duane> Yeah.
[6:32] <Logarith> Mining helmets would be great.
[6:32] <Duane> Oh god yes.

[6:32] <Visiiri> Recycling 7888 items (237 gigs)
[6:32] <Miclee> Mining helmets with lights on them
[6:32] <Duane> Turning around and suddenly lighting up a creeper's face.
[6:32] <IDTL> imagine flying around
[6:32] <IDTL> making your own runways
[6:32] <Visiiri> That's probably the most epic thing ever

[6:32] <Logarith> Torch above normal helmet in crafting table.
[6:32] <Logarith> :D
[6:32] <Kokopure> I want a diving suit :x
[6:32] <IDTL> ooh diving suit
[6:32] <Logarith> o2 tanks would be great.

[6:33] <Logarith> Or just air bladders insted of a whole suit.
[6:33] <Kokopure> :|
[6:33] <Duane> Why give us all this water if we can't explore it?
[6:33] <IDTL> with underwater caves and stuff to explore
[6:33] <Kokopure> I want, like, a metal helmet.
[6:33] <Kokopure> like...
[6:33] <Visiiri> I want an enchanted helm.
[6:33] <Logarith> Air bladders would be best.

[6:33] <Visiiri> Enchanting for water breathing!
[6:33] <Logarith> Enchantment is probably coming, Notch said.
[6:33] <Kokopure> ^ I think one of those would suffice.
[6:33] <Duane> But it would need to provide light or something.

[6:35] <Duane> Windows XP
[6:35] <Duane> Service Pack 3.
[6:35] <LuciferZ> My arts, Outsomnia
[6:35] <IDTL> I might be the only person who thinks oceans should be even deeper
[6:35] <Duane> They should be deeper, but only if we can explore them.
[6:35] <Logarith> A'ight. I think Infdev saves are in...
[6:35] <vurtual> SP3 should be called "Service Pack Why Aren't I using Vista or Seven Yet?"
[6:35] <outsomnia> Bronze-casting or marble-sculpting?
[6:36] <LuciferZ> Digital painting
[6:36] <outsomnia> Okay
[6:36] <Duane> Vista bites di-
[6:36] <Naxza> Plenty of reasons not to use vista or seven.
[6:36] <Duane> I'd go to Windows 7, but that's it.
[6:36] <vurtual> Vista is fine.
[6:36] <vurtual> Only a fool would insult it.
[6:36] <outsomnia> Also because Vista and 7 aren't as ?????? as XP.
[6:36] <Duane> Vista is NOT fine.
[6:36] <vurtual> Because only a fool could fail to use it.
[6:36] <Logarith> C:\Users\[name]\Appdata\.minecraft
[6:36] <Naxza> I'm a fool, then.
[6:36] <outsomnia> :3
[6:36] <vurtual> What's your problem with vista?
[6:36] <Logarith> Just find that folder and delete it.
[6:36] <vurtual> It starts up fairly quickly
[6:36] <Logarith> I don't mind vista as an external OS.
[6:36] <vurtual> It supports new things, it can handle 32-bit programs
[6:36] <vurtual> WHILE being 64-bit
[6:37] <Shadaez> Duane bandwagon more without any experience with the os
[6:37] <Logarith> But it's fileshitstom is... Well...
[6:37] <IDTL> When you die
[6:37] * Kokopure is a W7 user :x
[6:37] <Logarith> Oops, freudian slip. ^___^;
[6:37] <vurtual> NTFS isn't going to kill you, and XP and 7 use that both
[6:37] <IDTL> it should say how many days/nights you've been alive
[6:37] <Calhoun> Vista has only been fine since SP 2. And even then it's still not too great. Windows 7 surpasses it, and there is no reason to get vista, at this point in time.
[6:37] <Naxza> "Program X has crashed. Windows is checking for a solution to the problem." "This program is not responding. Windows is checking for a solution to this problem."
[6:37] <IDTL> and then you could have some personal high-score thing
[6:37] <Naxza> And you know what?
[6:37] <Naxza> Windows NEVER FINDS A SOLUTION.
[6:37] <Logarith> I would LOVE a clock.
[6:37] <Kokopure> Naxza, hahaha
[6:37] <Kokopure> that's absolutely true
[6:37] <IDTL> With animated textures :D
[6:37] <Logarith> You can keep a calendar yourself.
[6:38] <vede> I have this theory that if you look hard enough on the internet, then you can find someone saying that x is somehow evil, specifically in a religious context, where x is anything that exists. As a result, I loooove this website: http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/ because they cover pretty much everything you can think of.
[6:38] <Kokopure> but I won't :3
[6:38] <Naxza> "Sys32 needs administrator permission to run!"
[6:38] <Naxza> Okay, that one didn't happen.
[6:38] <vede> Really, just follow that link, close your eyes, and click two or three times in random places.
[6:38] <vede> Then read whatever you're at. It'll be hilarious.
[6:38] <vurtual> I don't find depressing religious people funny
[6:38] <vurtual> just depressing
[6:39] <outsomnia> I'd find depressing religious people religious
[6:39] <Duane> Yeah, I can't find the Appdata.
[6:39] <Duane> >_>
[6:39] <outsomnia> if I could find any
[6:39] <outsomnia> Duane, did you check hidden folders?
[6:39] <Duane> No idea how to do that. >_>
[6:39] <Naxza> I'm gonna shoot some zombies in L4D2 while the night is still young.
[6:40] <Duane> The sad part being that I consider myself good with computers.
[6:40] <Naxza> Take care, folks.
[6:40] <vurtual> wait
[6:40] <vurtual> did duane insult vista?
[6:40] <IDTL> I use so much sand in MC, the coast guard would arrest me
[6:40] <outsomnia> vrry gud
[6:40] <vurtual> and then not know how to see hidden folders?
[6:40] <Duane> Yeah.
[6:40] <outsomnia> It's Duane.
[6:40] * Kokopure pat pats Duane
[6:40] <Duane> But that's just because Vista can't play games.
[6:40] <vurtual> it can't?
[6:40] <IDTL> most of my buildings are like 30% cobblestone 70% glass
[6:40] <Duane> Vista has no games.
[6:40] <Naxza> That reminds me.
[6:40] <Naxza> "
[6:40] <vurtual> It doesn't?
[6:40] <outsomnia> Well, it's got more games than the 360 at this point :D.
[6:40] <Duane> It doesn't.
[6:40] <vurtual> ArmA 2 is just here... not existing?
[6:40] <Duane> Yeah.
[6:40] <vurtual> And half-life 2 is some figment of imagination?>
[6:41] <Duane> ArmA 2 sucks.
[6:41] <vurtual> FSX is some falsity?
[6:41] <Duane> HL2 isn't Vista Exclusive.
[6:41] <vurtual> it doesn't have to be "vista exclusive"
[6:41] <Duane> FSX is something I am not familiar with.

[7:46] <EagleYS> Hai
[7:46] <vurtual> the terrain goes from "believably barren" to "splotches of stone for no good reason"
[7:46] <rcfighter> But we won't fall through floors.
[7:46] <vurtual> falling through floors is a feature :(
[7:46] <Vicrry> My problem with Daggerfall is that it's HUGE. And to do it that big, they used the copy/paste brush. Everywhere. All the time. Constantly.
[7:47] <rcfighter> The only feature that I dislike about Daggerfall, at that.
[7:47] <rcfighter> Aside from the fact the guards shout HALT every two seconds when you do something wrong.
[7:47] <rcfighter> Then again, you can do something about the guards.
[7:47] <Vicrry> Murder them in the face?
[7:47] <Vicrry> That's my second choice in Morrowind
[7:48] <rcfighter> Exatcly.
[7:48] <vurtual> It was generated
[7:48] <Vicrry> Especially with Ordinators
[7:48] <vurtual> "copy-paste" isn't that unrealistic you know

[7:48] <IDTL> Oh man vurtual
[7:48] <IDTL> someone should put infdev in there
[7:49] <rcfighter> Yeah. I saw a few of the textures from daggerfall in Doom.
[7:49] <SireTRM> Minecraft: we have, what? Under 200 textures?
[7:49] <IDTL> Not even 100
[7:49] <IDTL> Like 50 or so
[7:49] <IDTL> holy tits
[7:50] <outsomnia> ITT: Holy Tits.
[7:50] <vurtual> infdev isn't exactly comparable
[7:50] <IDTL> I'm digging a ton of stone to make an underwater city
[7:50] <vurtual> since it's entirely randomly generated ground
[7:50] <vurtual> without any kind of map
[7:50] <IDTL> and my torches in my mineshaft make a chain
[7:50] <IDTL> bioshock, the great chain
[7:50] <rcfighter> When Infdev gets biomes, I'm going to make Hammerfell.
[7:50] <SireTRM> Yea, I count just over 80 on this .30 skin
[7:50] <Vicrry> anyway, my big problem with Daggerfell isn't that it looks the same - Morrowind had buildings that were exactly alike. But that some of the entire towns WERE the same. :P
[7:51] <IDTL> hammerfell?
[7:51] <rcfighter> A place in Daggerfall.
[7:51] <rcfighter> If I remember correctly, it was snowy there.
[7:51] <vurtual> did you emerge in that location?
[7:51] <rcfighter> say Nope.
[7:52] <vurtual> this new medal of honor game looks horrible
[7:52] <vurtual> it saddens me
[7:52] <Vicrry> it does
[7:52] <rcfighter> agh. I keep accidentally putting 'say' before what i mean to say
[7:52] <rcfighter> These text based games are rotting my mind.
[7:52] <SireTRM> XD
[7:52] <vurtual> talk rcfighter
[7:52] <vurtual> say "me too"
[7:52] <Vicrry> Most of the E3 OMFG LOOKITTHIS! games I was just like *sigh*

[7:57] <Vicrry> Metal Gears have gone downhill. Ever since the writers decided to hire 1st graders and make a plotline that makes a plate of spagetti look untangled, the games have been getting lamer
[7:57] <rcfighter> Zombies? More like a full formation of skeletons, each in the perfect position to shoot at you.

[15:57] <Kokopure> :x
[15:57] <gdude2002> Visiiri: X-Ray specs
[15:57] <Visiiri> and be able to enchant them to see certain things better
[15:57] <gdude2002> anyway
[15:57] <gdude2002> workworkwork tiem
[15:57] <Visiiri> Maybe fiberoptics

[15:59] <Visiiri> He hasn't gone into much detail other than it's not throwing fireballs at people or jedi mind trick
[15:59] <Shrub> I see
[15:59] <Shrub> so fire arrows?
[15:59] <Visiiri> i think he's just adding enchanting.
[15:59] <Visiiri> No, I would assume underwater breathing hats
[15:59] <Visiiri> boots of speed
[15:59] <Visiiri> Boots of reduced fall damage
[15:59] <Visiiri> fire sword
[16:00] <Visiiri> Maybe increased armor values

[16:01] <Visiiri> I never do.
[16:01] <Visiiri> I just find the nearest large lake.
[16:01] <Kokopure> haha

[16:20] <ZaxKellens|Work> Why not 3?

[16:23] <ZaxKellens|Work> Spiders and Creepers are immune to sunlight
[16:23] <KV44HaV> so you gotta make som kind of roof over the most of it Vis{Swimmin} ?
[16:23] <Vis{Swimmin}> Yeah
[16:23] <KV44HaV> so they'll spawn
[16:23] <Vis{Swimmin}> it's got to be dark enough for them to spawn in the back
[16:23] <ZaxKellens|Work> So make it like a tube
[16:23] <KV44HaV> how dark is that?
[16:24] <Vis{Swimmin}> pretty dark
[16:24] <ZaxKellens|Work> Thta hsa the water/lava push the spawned mobs in the back out into the sun in a pit?

[16:24] <Vis{Swimmin}> ZaxKellens|Work: exactly
[16:24] <KV44HaV> okay :D, going to go tryk that :)

[16:24] <ZaxKellens|Work> Ok, it makes more sense nao

[16:24] <Vis{Swimmin}> and a checkerboard of stuff for spawn space
[16:24] <Vis{Swimmin}> inside of a large cave
[16:24] <KV44HaV> do the creepers also drops when killed by sin Vis{Swimmin} ?

[16:27] <ZaxKellens|Work> You could have a boat "road"

[16:29] <ZaxKellens|Work> Yes?
[16:30] <TrueWolves> If we make mines near the top of artifical rivers, miners can deposite blocks in to the river and let the river act as a convair belt back to the town on MP servers
[16:30] <ZaxKellens|Work> Yep
[16:30] <ZaxKellens|Work> But that would only work on MP
[16:30] <ZaxKellens|Work> Because SP the blocks would disappear before you could get to them probably
[16:31] <Shrub> As I have said, I moved in on 16 July 1923. My household consisted of seven servants and nine cats, of which latter species I am particularly fond.

[16:38] <Xybjj> Oh my god I'm so friggin' pissed
[16:38] <Xybjj> I mined out a huge bit 1 level above lava
[16:38] <Xybjj> NOTHING.
[16:38] <Xybjj> No coal, no iron, no gold, no diamond.
[16:39] <TrueWolves> The new 64x64x128 chuncks although will use 1/3rd of the RAM, will proubly use about 50% more cpu

[16:40] <Xybjj> I've been relying on lava to light up my place
[16:40] <TrueWolves> I do that too.
[16:40] <TrueWolves> tempted to go look for sand so as too make glass covers for my lava lights
[16:40] <Xybjj> Cial, I dug up around 50 by 50 by 2
[16:40] <TrueWolves> Xybjj
[16:40] <TrueWolves> I had to dig about 300 blocks worth before I ran in to Iron once, that's not uncommon
[16:41] <TrueWolves> It's a lot based on luck
[16:41] <Xybjj> 50 by 50 by 2 is 5000 blocks.
[16:41] <TrueWolves> (after finding said Iron, I quickly found a ton of coal >.>)
[16:41] <TrueWolves> ...
[16:41] <Krnau-> also based on mining technique

[16:42] <Xybjj> Fine ):
[16:42] <TrueWolves> It's all luck
[16:42] <TrueWolves> I've dug 35k blocks now with no diamond, only gold/iron/coal
[16:43] <LordQuorad> my infdev map is only 64 deep
[16:43] <TrueWolves> and yet snowman once found some diamond right away
[16:43] <Xybjj> Diamond is like a luxury, all my tools have been made of stone
[16:43] <LordQuorad> anyone have a deper one?
[16:43] <Cial> snow is evil
[16:43] <TrueWolves> Lord, it may be only 64 deep, but it's 128 tall
[16:43] <TrueWolves> ALL infdev maps are 128 tall from bottom to sky
[16:43] <LordQuorad> It needs to be INFINITE
[16:43] <TrueWolves> Lord, go read the blog
[16:43] <TrueWolves> =/
[16:43] <Xybjj> Dig deeper!
[16:43] <TrueWolves> You'll understand why he can't do infinite yet
[16:43] <LordQuorad> Isn't he making it bigger?
[16:43] <TrueWolves> He's trying to find a way to do that.
[16:44] <LordQuorad> not infinite, just really really large

[16:52] <TrueWolves> ...
[16:52] <TrueWolves> yeah, 1 second though
[16:52] <Xybjj> Why do you have +v on #furry?
[16:52] <TrueWolves> Simple, anyone who's proved not to be a troll has a +v there
[16:53] <Xybjj> Ah.
[16:53] <TrueWolves> 90% of the channel does, furry or not.
[16:53] <Xybjj> I see.
[16:53] <LordQuorad> +v?
[16:53] <TrueWolves> And there is a surprising amount of non-furrys there becuase the channel isn't a bunch of idiots.
[16:53] <Xybjj> Congratulations on proving yourself otherwise
[16:53] <Xybjj> Quorad - +v does nothing except allow you to talk when the entire channel is muted
[16:54] <Xybjj> Otherwise it's just a plus infront of your name
[16:54] <TrueWolves> Anyhow, someone on Notch's blog posted that he was disapointed by Notch's "Dynamic Water" as it was still very buggy and limited
[16:54] <TrueWolves> The next post was this:
[16:54] <TrueWolves> "It doesn't work just right yet, but be confident Notch knows, and it will.

[19:32] <Xybjj> What about astronauts?
[19:32] <ZaxKellens|Work> That's why when you get closer to a black hole, time slows way down while it goes by quickly from outside
[19:32] <Xybjj> Like those that stay in space stations
[19:32] <ZaxKellens|Work> They age slower than us
[19:33] <Shrub> what dicks
[19:33] <Xybjj> Ohh.
[19:33] <Marach> slower for us
[19:33] <ZaxKellens|Work> No, slower than us
[19:33] <Marach> they're aging normal speed for themselves
[19:33] <LordQuorad> My shadow's the only one that walks beside me!
[19:33] <Xybjj> I read somewhere that because blackholes suck in everything, including light, as you near the blackhole, time starts to stop
[19:33] <Marach> starts to stop = slows down
[19:33] <LordQuorad> and i walk alone.
[19:33] <ZaxKellens|Work> Yep
[19:33] <Xybjj> So if someone else is watching you walk into the blackhole, it'd take an infinite amount of time for them to see me walk into the blackhole
[19:34] <ZaxKellens|Work> Thta's why scifi blackholes are bullshit
[19:34] <Marach> yeah
[19:34] <ZaxKellens|Work> Kinda
[19:34] <ZaxKellens|Work> Watch Stargate
[19:34] <ZaxKellens|Work> They had a blackhole episode that was correct
[19:34] <Marach> i love minecraft :D
[19:34] <LordQuorad> Zax
[19:34] * Boodlings (boodlings@c-98-243-241-46.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[19:34] <ZaxKellens|Work> Yes?
[19:34] <Roadcrosser> If you traveled at the speed of light, time would stand still, frozen in time. As you start to slow down, time would begin moving again. The tricky part here is, as you leave the speed of light where time is frozen, when you start to slow down, time begins to move forward again and the slower you get from the speed of light, the more time itself begins to move faster.
[19:34] <LordQuorad> that's not how black holes work.
[19:35] <Marach> i wonder if notch will create a gamemode i'd enjoy
[19:35] <Roadcrosser> another zax
[19:35] * Boodlings (boodlings@c-98-243-241-46.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
[19:35] <KrimZon> i don't think you can get stuff with mass to reach the speed of light
[19:35] <ZaxKellens|Work> Hn, you actually know how it works Roadcrosser, do you read Hawking?
[19:35] <Marach> you can't
[19:35] <Roadcrosser> ...
[19:35] <Marach> if you want to travel faster than light...
[19:35] <Roadcrosser> maaaaaybe?
[19:35] <Marach> you need to find out how to move without gaining velocity
[19:35] <Xybjj> How old are you guys?
[19:35] <ZaxKellens|Work> If a tree falls in the woods and nobody hears it, does it make a sound?
[19:36] <LordQuorad> I appreciate you dumbing the concept down to get it to laymans terms, but you don't have to talk like time is an actual thing.
[19:36] <Marach> ZaxKellens|Work: depends where
[19:36] <Roadcrosser> yea
[19:36] <Roadcrosser> It does
[19:36] <Marach> in what reality o_O
[19:36] <Roadcrosser> if it's in a vacuum
[19:36] <Roadcrosser> no
[19:36] <Xybjj> It does not make any sound
[19:36] <Marach> if you want an answer, read 1/0
[19:36] <Xybjj> Sound is basically vibrations in the air intepreted by us
[19:36] <Marach> btw, falling doesn't make much of a sound
[19:36] <KrimZon> if it makes compression waves in air within human audible frequencies, i'd consider it to have made a sound even if noone ever heard the sound
[19:36] <Marach> :D
[19:37] <KrimZon> say if it got viewed on an oscilloscope or something
[19:37] <LordQuorad> No use talking about it through text, you can't get information across fast enough.
[19:37] <Xybjj> If noone is there to inteprete those vibrations in the air, then no sound is made?
[19:37] <Xybjj> At least, that's what I think
[19:37] <Marach> i said, read 1/0
[19:37] <Takos360> Will Notch update something today?
[19:37] <Vicrry> o/
[19:37] <Roadcrosser> The answer depends upon the particular definition of sound, whether it is the scientific (created vibrations) or the pragmatic (sound is the interpretation of these vibrations). There is no argument that a vibration occurs which will generate sound under any set of normal circumstances
[19:38] <Vicrry> Someone brings me breakfasts and a cookie!
[19:38] <Marach> how many breakfasts?
[19:38] <Roadcrosser> For example, if a Deaf person was in the woods and a tree fell, would it make a sound? No, because their auditory system would not pick up the vibrations that make sound. They may feel the lower vibrations in their body, but not the sound.
[19:38] <Vicrry> 2 would be nice
[19:38] <Roadcrosser> Zax, another?

[20:52] <liq3> ...
[20:52] <Vicrry> But if you have a fun game, don't mess with it. Sure you can do further development versions, and tinker with the formula, but at the end of the day when it's time to go mess about, bring out the stable and fun version :)
[20:53] <liq3> There is no stable and fun version. :/

[20:54] <Vicrry> eh
[20:54] <Vicrry> says you
[20:54] <Vicrry> I think indev, as is, is quite nice
[20:55] <Vicrry> Some ladders, doors, etc. from infdev would be nice, but is a solid game without
[20:55] <Mosslander> I'm so happy about the update (though I still would love caves, and wish he would break our saves sooner).
[20:55] <aphistic> i like infdev because you can go out and explore and you'll never really run out of resources

[20:58] <Xybjj> How would infdev in multiplayer work?
[20:58] <Vicrry> Also, who said I was testing?
[20:58] <Xybjj> If I played with a couple of people, and one of us went out to explore, it'd generate the terrain and everyone would have to download the new terrain
[20:58] <Xybjj> Wouldn't that build up a lot?
[20:59] <aphistic> that's one of the problems notch is trying to solve :)
[20:59] <aphistic> i personally can't wait for multiplayer infdev
[20:59] <Xybjj> not to mention if you spawn at this particular area, while everyone else is about 4 gigabytes of terrain away
[20:59] <aphistic> i can imagine huge villages and fortresses going up
[20:59] <aphistic> it'd be so cool to see
[21:00] <Vicrry> I would think multiplayer would be fun to see
[21:00] <Vicrry> Also, wouldn't mind it getting backburnered or turned into a longer-term project
[21:00] <Xybjj> what
[21:00] <Xybjj> you don't mind having to waitg 98435930845438 years for multiplayer?
[21:00] <Vicrry> sure
[21:01] <Vicrry> As long as the other projects are as kickarse as dynamic water
[21:01] <aphistic> at some point i hope for some mode of faster transportation
[21:01] <Nyghtshade> Maybe as the players move out an explore, all the information is saved on the Extremely unlucky server, and when/if the server reaches its limitIt stops generating terrain and walls up like a normal map
[21:01] <Xybjj> A faster mode of transport - mine carts?
[21:01] <Vicrry> Aircraft would be sweet
[21:01] <Nyghtshade> Boats
[21:01] <aphistic> that or little rafts that you could float on down a current
[21:01] <Nyghtshade> im waiting for them
[21:02] <Vicrry> Something to get a bird's eye view for scouting about without building a 1x1 sand tower :P
[21:02] <Nyghtshade> " (Oh, and also, with plenty of water.. boats?)" Qouted from notches blog
[21:02] <aphistic> coordinates would be nice
[21:02] <Nyghtshade> Cannot wait
[21:02] <Xybjj> maybe someone can make a mod for minecraft
[21:02] <Xybjj> to make it modern
[21:03] <Xybjj> add stuff like guns
[21:03] <Nyghtshade> Need Spyglass
[21:03] <aphistic> notch said he might open it up sometime down the line
[21:03] <aphistic> but no guns ><
[21:03] <Xybjj> texture back
[21:03] <Xybjj> bows = guns

[22:34] <ZomBuster> I'm lagging too
[22:34] <ZomBuster> like every few seconds it freezes

[23:45] <EmpiresBane> Obtuse_goose, we know what it means
[23:45] <Obtuse_goose> the place is a shittorm of caves
[23:45] <nlittle> Right, why is that such a big deal?

[23:49] <vurtual> turns out someone had put a disney CD in a CD player for no apparent reason
[23:49] <IDTL> It won't seem to grow
[23:49] <Darkebrz> I'm really starting to get mad at datarealms
[23:49] <bildramer> don't publicly post this without spoilers, fucktard
[23:49] <IDTL> does it need another block above the wheat?
[23:49] <Darkebrz> I bought their game a few months ago
[23:49] <LordQuorad> guys I found gold
[23:49] <bildramer> now who is gestahl
[23:49] <vurtual> it became semi-apparent once another disney theme played, and got lame around "under the sea"
[23:49] <LordQuorad> except it's on layer number 1
[23:49] <vurtual> which was next
[23:49] <bildramer> and in which FF game is Kefka?
[23:49] <LordQuorad> meaning it's on magma
[23:49] <Darkebrz> And they havn't updated the blog in a month
[23:49] <Darkebrz> It's really pissing me off
[23:49] <LordQuorad> fml, can't get it!
[23:49] <Darkebrz> I want to play the damn game not just wait
[23:49] <vurtual> Didn't know we had a CD player
[23:50] <Darkebrz> I WANT CORTEX COMMAND D:
[23:50] <Liam> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/226266/ Yay, debug. The /infdev/ client prints up to line 38 initializing, then it shows the main menu. When i try and generate, line 39+ is printed, and java dies.
[23:50] <vurtual> java just fainted
[23:51] <vurtual> take it to a pokemon center

[23:56] <Quatroking> you're starting the game
[23:56] <Darkebrz> What?
[23:56] <leBMD> obtuse, could I silently cry now that I've read that?
[23:56] <lolcat> i will poke it today and see what happens
[23:56] <Quatroking> yeah, I have so much addons too that it takes a whopping 4 minutes to start cortex command
[23:56] <cryzed> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/tqGGqVm21lbscFMLvmdw/ -> This is what happens to my JVM
[23:56] <Darkebrz> I have quite a few and it takes a while
[23:56] <nlittle> I am on Mac trying the new infdev
[23:56] <leBMD> Iv'e yet to find any realy caves on my map. Only small overhangs on the tops of mountains.
[23:56] <Darkebrz> But seriously, the next build better absolutely fucking massive
[23:57] <Quatroking> yes
[23:57] <EmpiresBane> leBMD, is it a new map?

[23:59] <Darkebrz> At this rate the game will never be finished

[23:59] <Kokopure> yoshibot, is it an obvious one?
[23:59] <outsomnia> Lava, for when you really need to get rid of that skeleton/creeper headed towards you.
[23:59] <yoshibot> a cave got generated a bit under some water
