[0:07] <MC_fanatic> It was jokingly, you uptight condescending mofo
[0:07] <Miclee> Why do we have OPs that are AFK 24/7?

[0:09] <Siiseli> besides watching irc

[0:10] <Konogan> Good idea.
[0:10] <outsomnia|Clinton> OPs or Hops, etc.
[0:10] <Quatroking> people discriminate those who discriminate therefore discriminators discriminate

[0:10] * Talmanaze (chatzilla@cpe-173-095-168-207.nc.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:10] <Marach> hops are pointless
[0:10] <Zuriki> Nobody will get to play it
[0:10] <rcfighter> Most of the IRC channels I'm on have at least 1 or 2 HalfOps.
[0:10] <Marach> you either trust someone or don't
[0:11] <Marach> you can't halftrust.
[0:11] <Quatroking> I should probably start making something notcheriffic so I get a pass
[0:11] <Quatroking> maybe finish that minecraft flash I was working on
[0:11] <mnjiman> i think halfops is good for having more respectable users to look up to on how to behave in a channel
[0:11] <outsomnia|Clinton> So all op'sll have chanserv access?
[0:11] <mnjiman> vs someone who is activly moding it
[0:11] <lemon> hey guys!

[0:43] <Nova> Red Dead Redemption just looks like a wild-west version of GTA.

[1:30] <ThomasBags> i wonder what it would be like then if he put them back in
[1:30] <mnjiman> ya but that is without caves
[1:30] <Juraka> oo maybe optimizing cave rendering, not generation?
[1:30] <ThomasBags> i like them
[1:30] <GreenHoopla> What I do is dig a staircase down until I find the lava at the end of the world, and dig around there
[1:31] <Zaneo> yeah but he didn't add the cave system because he knew it would be a bitch

[1:31] <ThomasBags> i've build a castle with 2 towers and a giant spiral dirt tower
[1:31] <Konogan> It's cubic in fact.
[1:31] <Zaneo> in indev you oculd technically run out of resources
[1:31] <ThomasBags> one big farm, sub basement
[1:31] <liq3> Konogan: yes, flat.
[1:31] <ThomasBags> living room
[1:31] <GreenHoopla> But with Huge, it would take many many many days/weeks
[1:31] <Konogan> Cubic.
[1:31] <Zaneo> in inf it is impossible
[1:32] <liq3> Zaneo: nope...
[1:32] <liq3> :P
[1:32] <mnjiman> not impossible
[1:32] <mnjiman> just not feasible
[1:32] <GreenHoopla> So who all here is actually planning on hosting an Infinite survival server? :)
[1:32] <ThomasBags> resources can become hard to get

[1:32] <mnjiman> If i knew how to i would
[1:32] <liq3> You'd also need a REALLY BIG harddrive.
[1:32] <GreenHoopla> I bought a 2tb external harddrive
[1:32] <ThomasBags> theere should be re-generating areas
[1:32] <GreenHoopla> INF servers are part of the reason
[1:32] <CrazySpai> I sent an email to notch asking him to be the first offer them

[1:33] <ThomasBags> 2 to the what
[1:33] <CrazySpai> 200ish PB
[1:33] <mnjiman> Crazy how many people will be able to be on your server?
[1:33] <Zaneo> as much "impossible" as one can get
[1:33] <ThomasBags> so what is that, 2^128 or something
[1:33] <CrazySpai> mnjiman: I'm not sure. It's whatever he allows per server.

[1:33] <mnjiman> can i have a home on your server? :P
[1:33] <GreenHoopla> I have awesome internet and an awesome PC, so it'll be fun :D
[1:34] <ThomasBags> but seriously there should be regenerating areas

[1:34] * shinD (leuka@otitsun.oulu.fi) has joined #minecraft
[1:34] <Juraka> well yeah, but as random as you can get
[1:34] <ThomasBags> >random
[1:34] <ThomasBags> >java
[1:34] <ThomasBags> lol
[1:35] <Zaneo> there is no random lol
[1:35] <Zaneo> only close
[1:35] <Juraka> I know
[1:35] <ThomasBags> what random gen do you think notch uses
[1:35] <mnjiman> Incoming Gaint Indev Castle (walls and Towers)
[1:35] <ThomasBags> based on clock?
[1:35] <ThomasBags> those suck
[1:35] <Zaneo> You guys corrected me on "impossible" i'll correct on "random"
[1:35] <Juraka> anyways, why re-generate a desert if you don't like it? there's like a billion other places to go, and maybe someone likes the desert?
[1:35] <ThomasBags> well then you'd need a teleporting system
[1:35] <GreenHoopla> If land randomly re-generated I would lose my stuff too fast :(
[1:36] <Zaneo> ifyou put a random from a clock with another random then it works fine
[1:36] <ThomasBags> well if you build somewhere
[1:36] <ThomasBags> say it restricts for filling in
[1:36] <ThomasBags> only regenerating areas no one has visited for forever
[1:36] <ThomasBags> have trees grow on their own too
[1:36] <ThomasBags> that'd be nice
[1:36] <Juraka> hmm... yeah I agree with trees
[1:36] <ThomasBags> have some sort of town system

[2:32] <LanternGhost> 3 weeks?
[2:32] <ClassiestMedic> e_e
[2:32] <Murgy> If he waits on a Mac before testing Multiplayer, then we may see a screenshot or two by 2013.
[2:32] <Malikat> notch's email: markus@mojang.com
[2:32] <SpaceManiac> Lots of talk, I can barely concentrate :P

[2:33] <LanternGhost> I am say 6 months
[2:33] <MC_fanatic> Word thomas has some interesting ideas usually!
[2:33] <MC_fanatic> Wod *COMMA*
[2:33] <Theodore> meh
[2:33] <ClassiestMedic> Nice! It got released! OH SHI-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
[2:33] <Theodore> night all
[2:33] <KodaichiZero> naw

[2:33] <MC_fanatic> Ni
[2:33] <KodaichiZero> it's probably going to be two weeks at max
[2:33] <LanternGhost> I say 6 months and a half!

[2:33] <Malikat> ClassiestMedic: no, the release CAUSES the armageddon!
[2:33] <Snowman> He isn't gonna work on the MBP, he's just gonna use it to test it for macs
[2:33] <Law> I say tomorrow. Multiplayer infdev will be released tomorrow
[2:33] <Corvak> lol
[2:34] <SpaceManiac> Interestignly, I've never had a problem with creepers
[2:34] <LanternGhost> He is going to work on Multiplayer surival
[2:34] <Murgy> Hell, Law has a point.
[2:34] <Malikat> SpaceManiac: have you played infdev much?
[2:34] <SpaceManiac> Just accidentally exploding my own TNT
[2:34] <Snowman> Why would he work on a MBP if he has a beast of a computer with 4 monitors?
[2:34] <MC_fanatic> Me too i usually save :P
[2:34] <LanternGhost> He is doing it now, he is buying a mac so he can test it on that mac.
[2:34] <Malikat> Creepers used to spawn like retarded hyena packs
[2:34] <SpaceManiac> Malikat: well, not that much since the enemies got added
[2:34] <KodaichiZero> He's already done creative multiplayer, so that experience will probably make it a lot easier for him
[2:34] <LanternGhost> He isn't stopping development in till he gets the game.
[2:34] * Qboll (pontus_lan@h194n3-j-d3.ias.bredband.telia.com) has joined #minecraft
[2:34] <Murgy> He will test it on a Mac, find no way of fixing it, and then release.
[2:34] <LanternGhost> You are right Kodaichi
[2:34] <KodaichiZero> not looking forward to downloading 5MB maps
[2:34] <Malikat> and the spawning code was bugged, so sometimes they'd spawn IN LIGHT. fuckedville.
[2:34] <DC_> OH OH
[2:34] <MC_fanatic> It shouldn't be long. Even 2 person MP for a while would be interesting
[2:34] <SpaceManiac> Yeah, I heard about that
[2:35] <DC_> I know what Notch could do.
[2:35] <LanternGhost> He is still going to work on it even though he doesn't have a mac.
[2:35] <DC_> He could give a link to five different people to give out to friends.

[2:35] <SpaceManiac> I kind of liked it without any enemies, it was easier to do things
[2:35] <KodaichiZero> Chain mail! lol
[2:35] <Law> theres always peaceful mode
[2:35] <Malikat> KodaichiZero: i suspect you will probably just have to download a 256*256*128 area upon server join
[2:35] <Wervyn> Google invite strategy.
[2:35] <DC_> bye all.
[2:35] * DC_ (halothreeg@pool-71-171-143-42.chi01.dsl-w.verizon.net) has left #minecraft

[2:35] <Fractal> and then stream
[2:35] <KodaichiZero> yeah
[2:35] <Murgy> I Have Got It!!!
[2:35] <MC_fanatic> MEh Good day to all of you

[2:36] <Steel> i'll be making traps
[2:36] <Law> well steel with the map being 8 times the size of earth theres no reason you can't carve one out yourself
[2:36] <Schaap> il make a spawn island in the center of LAVA
[2:36] <LanternGhost> So..
[2:36] <Malikat> If i get invited to the pre-testing of multiplayer, be assured that i will stream like crazy unless notch specifically forbids it.
[2:36] <LanternGhost> No caves in infdev yet right?
[2:36] <Steel> It's going to take age
[2:36] <Law> traps are bloody amazing now that I've worked out how to make them
[2:36] <LanternGhost> Same here Malikat
[2:36] <Wervyn> Yes to traps. Not because they're actually likely to accomplish anything, just because they're fun to make.
[2:36] <liq3> KodaichiZero: lol i'd probably mine your server and run off with it. <3
[2:36] <Steel> but it would be so epic
[2:36] <Murgy> Post A Link up of the fourms that leads to the test server. That server have one map that is 128*128*128
[2:36] <LanternGhost> I will be all over that like flies on poop

[2:37] <LanternGhost> What do you mean schaap?

[2:37] <LanternGhost> I really want those ;_;
[2:37] <Malikat> Eztuzt: I was on creative the day before last, trying to make a fourth iteration menger-sierpinski sponge

[2:37] <Astroman> I never played creative
[2:37] <Eztuzt> Does anyone know what happened to that minas tirith WoM was making?
[2:37] <Schaap> I stopped my server because no one joined and the server software sucked
[2:37] <KodaichiZero> not if you can't get out of the jail :/
[2:37] <LanternGhost> I am not sure if I want multiplayer survival more then caves...
[2:37] <Malikat> the external surface was 81*81*81

[2:38] <LanternGhost> No longer alpha?
[2:38] <ClassiestMedic> ^O^
[2:38] <SlashCaps> no
[2:38] <Malikat> LanternGhost: it's pretty fucking close to beta, yeah
[2:38] <Murgy> No
[2:38] <LanternGhost> Alright
[2:38] * ClassiestMedic is fucking ecstatic
[2:38] <Zoronian> He said we'd be seeing beta this week.
[2:38] <Malikat> it'll be a little bit of bug squashing, then beta, i would assume.
[2:38] <LanternGhost> So I should tell all my friends to buy it before it goes to beta then.
[2:38] <Malikat> Zoronian: you crazy?
[2:38] <Wervyn> Did he now?
[2:38] <Zoronian> No.
[2:39] <Zoronian> I just wouldn't mind being able to play Multiplayer.
[2:39] <LanternGhost> God
[2:39] <Malikat> Zoronian: this article needs citations
[2:39] <LanternGhost> All i can think about now is minecraft
[2:39] <LanternGhost> hopefully I can get some work done
[2:39] <Law> I've got secret insider information that he's actually releasing it within the hour
[2:39] <Zoronian> I really don't care about bugs.
[2:39] <LanternGhost> Lol
[2:39] <Murgy> 1. Start work on multiplayer, and use the MacBook Pro I ordered last week to test how well it works. (this also means mac support should get better)
[2:39] <Murgy> 2. Invite people from IRC to help test multiplayer
[2:39] <bildramer> fffff
[2:39] <Murgy> 3. Release test multiplayer server software
[2:39] <Murgy> 4. Implement the missing features from indev into infdev (item shadows, flowers, caves, mushrooms)
[2:39] <Murgy> 5. Make a level loader for infdev, that loads old maps (creative, survival mode test) and indev maps
[2:39] <Snowman> Law, and who might you be?
[2:39] <Murgy> 6. Replace indev with infdev
[2:39] <Murgy> 7. Wait until it works
[2:39] <Murgy> 8. Replace all public versions with indev/infdev
[2:39] <Murgy> 9. BETA
[2:39] <LanternGhost> Snowman he trollin

[2:48] <Eagle> how do you not know this
[2:48] <Malikat> since his brain exploded on a plane?
[2:48] <Eztuzt> It was an accident involving magic putty and blue balls...
[2:48] <Malikat> Azathoth: put a joke cigar inside a papercraft creeper with a fuse attached to the inside of the drawer
[2:49] <Snowman> Billy Mays died the saturday after Michael Jackson died
[2:49] <Snowman> They were both 50

[2:49] <Eagle> and then somebody else died

[2:51] <CrazySpai> 50 year old meat between 10 year old buns
[2:51] <Eztuzt> He names his children Prince Michael Jackson and called the other Blanket..
[2:51] <Pi_Master> cause he died...and was famous...everybody forgot about what happened.

[2:58] <k96spy> i hate when they spawn in my house or base though
[2:58] <Eztuzt> Thats because they forgot how to eat grass
[2:58] <Eagle> There's Animator!
[2:58] <Konogan> Notch's gonna implement breeding later or sooner.

[2:59] <LanternGhost> So I can have kinky animal breeding?
[2:59] <Steel> never stand near a tall cliff
[2:59] <Pi_Master> no...the kinkiest it gets is despawning
[2:59] <Steel> because a sheep will be there, and then !
[2:59] <LuciferZ> Hey, do you guys like minecraft streams for the swearing at creepers? And the dying by skeleton?

[2:59] <Yourself> "sitting around with your thumb up your ass"
[2:59] <Steel> yep

[2:59] <Yourself> cracks me up every time

[3:02] <Zoronian> I've been a member since the first month of minecraft and I wanna play MP indev/infdev
[3:02] <Eagle> "O"?
[3:02] <Gyro> You ooohhh me quite a bit of money Iguana.
[3:02] <Iguana> Orly.
[3:02] <Pi_Master> yarly
[3:03] <Fractal> indev only has the edge really on water physics, thusly logic machines
[3:03] <Gyro> yarly
[3:03] <k96spy> im going to make lots of tnt and rig up my house and wait for people to come by
[3:03] <Iguana> And Animator, if you need an extra chanOP...*cough*
[3:03] <Zoronian> LMFAO
[3:03] <Zoronian> k96 that would kick butt.
[3:03] <Steel> the new water physic is bad
[3:03] <Eztuzt> Ive been a member since early august
[3:03] <k96spy> then when there just out of range im gona blow it up
[3:03] <Zoronian> You can always modify physics steel.
[3:03] <Wervyn> And then blow up your house. Haha you sure showed them.
[3:03] <Eztuzt> Been playing*
[3:03] <Gyro> Zoronian, the multiplayer survival isn't going to come out for a while yet.
[3:03] <Steel> how ?
[3:03] * TtD (Mibbit@nowhere.uat.edu) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[3:03] <Zoronian> Whats the multiplayer going to be then?
[3:03] <Eztuzt> Hey
[3:03] <Zoronian> Death match?
[3:03] <Eztuzt> Does anyone
[3:03] <Iguana> No.
[3:03] <Iguana> Like indev, except with people.
[3:03] <Eztuzt> Want to make plans for multiplayer?
[3:03] <Steel> how i can modify water physic ?
[3:03] <Iguana> It CAN be deathmatch.
[3:03] <Zoronian> Thats what I wanted Iguana.
[3:03] <k96spy> then im gona run up to them and yell at them and say "why did you blow up my house"
[3:03] <Iguana> If you made it like that.
[3:03] <Eztuzt> I say we make a giant group of towers
[3:04] <Zoronian> Execpt they can still ur money right?
[3:04] <Eagle> Build an Arena
[3:04] <Iguana> What is money?
[3:04] <Zoronian> *steal
[3:04] <Zoronian> -_-
[3:04] <Iguana> In minecraft, there is no currency.
[3:04] <Eztuzt> With bridges connected near the top
[3:04] <Zoronian> \facepalm
[3:04] <Eztuzt> Onl pain
[3:04] <Iguana> But I'm assuming people will use gold bars.
[3:04] <Zoronian> Yes.
[3:04] <Zoronian> Ima build a bank, bro.
[3:04] <Iguana> Seeing as how gold armor = Stupid
[3:04] <Gyro> Zoronian, he's going to be working on multiplayer /indev/ for at least a week before he starts inviting people in for testing.
[3:04] <Steel> gold should have a use
[3:04] <Astroman> I'm gonna rob your bank, bro
[3:04] <Zoronian> I know Gryo.
[3:04] <Zoronian> *Gyro.
[3:04] <k96spy> also i just listened to that MJ song you told me to listen to
[3:04] <Iguana> If I run a server, gold will most likely be the currency
[3:04] <Zoronian> I'm just sayin'.
[3:04] <Wervyn> That's always bothered me, the gold armor thing.
[3:04] <Eztuzt> Currency will be useful only if NPC shops come out, which i dont think will happen anytime soon if at all
[3:05] <Iguana> Has anyone ever thought about setting up a bazaar in indev?
[3:05] <Wervyn> You need iron to mine gold because it's too hard for stone picks.
[3:05] <Zoronian> Plaer shops.
[3:05] <Iguana> I would LOVE to just sell bread.
[3:05] <Wervyn> But once you get it, it's basically worthless.
[3:05] <Gyro> I'm thinking that iron bars will become the currency.
[3:05] <Zoronian> We could create a system where money makes you a higher rank in the server.
[3:05] <Eztuzt> Bread ftw
[3:05] <Eagle> The only reason gold was a useful material in real life was because it look pretty, and it was/is a good conductor.
[3:05] <Eztuzt> Nyahhhaaa....
[3:05] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[3:05] <Iguana> Sit at the edge of the bazaar..."BREAD FOR 1 GOLD. HEALS LITERALLY NOTHING"
[3:05] <Eagle> Minecraft doesn't really have asthetics or electricity soooo
[3:05] <Eztuzt> Gold also isnt affected by water and stuff like that
[3:05] <Zoronian> I
[3:05] <Iguana> And the meat vendor adjacent to me, stealin' my customers.
[3:05] <Yourself> <Eagle> The only reason gold was a useful material in real life was because it look pretty, and it was/is a good conductor.
[3:05] <Wervyn> Minecraft has aesthetics, what are you talking about?
[3:05] <Zoronian> I'd make gold the ranking system.
[3:05] <Yourself> don't forget corrosion
[3:05] <Eztuzt> Iguana
[3:05] <Zoronian> if you have like 1000 gold your rank 1
[3:05] <Gyro> Iron is both useful and plentiful - but not too plentiful. It'll probably become the currency.
[3:05] <Eagle> Yeah Eztuzt said that
[3:05] <Eztuzt> you make the bread
[3:05] <Iguana> I'd get so fed up, I'd run over there, and stab his ass with my diamond blde.
[3:05] <Eztuzt> ill make the sammiches
[3:05] <Zoronian> 500 gold is rank 2
[3:05] <Eagle> I forgot about that.
[3:06] <Iguana> Eztuzt, kay.
[3:06] <Yourself> so he did
[3:06] <Iguana> *high fives*
[3:06] <Zoronian> and you use gold to buy stuff from other players
[3:06] <Zoronian> It would be fun.
[3:06] <Eagle> Minecraft doesn't have corrosion either

[3:06] <Eztuzt> Well start a chain monopoly with this

[3:06] <Eagle> Waterpig
[3:06] <Iguana> It'll...be...awesome.
[3:06] <Gyro> Everybody does apparently Iguana.
[3:06] <Eztuzt> All while raping your wife
[3:06] <k96spy> oh what would be fun is to make a long line of tnt right under the ground and have it branch out in all directions
[3:06] <Iguana> Yeh.
[3:06] <SlashCaps> Gold will be useless in currency unless forced via server rules.
[3:06] <Eztuzt> But lets be serious, everyone
[3:06] <Wervyn> Spawn rules, that's another thing. I would like a rule where livestock can't spawn without a direct line of sight to the sky.
[3:06] <Eztuzt> We need to gather a massive amount of stone
[3:06] <k96spy> then if someone is about to kill you take everyone out with you
[3:07] <Eztuzt> All toghether
[3:07] <Zoronian> SlashCaps I'm going to make gold currecny and the ranking system.
[3:07] <Eztuzt> And erect about 15 towers
[3:07] <Eztuzt> Past the clouds

[3:07] <Zoronian> and I'm going to add the ability to kill others.
[3:07] <Eztuzt> Fill in the spaces
[3:07] <Eztuzt> And build a city
[3:07] <Eztuzt> In the air
[3:07] <Gyro> Hell yeah we do
[3:07] <Gyro> Sounds good to me
[3:07] <Eagle> Currency: Coal > Iron > Gold > Diamond?
[3:07] <LanternGhost> O.o

[3:07] <LanternGhost> So any news?
[3:07] <Gyro> Coal would be a bad currency, it's too common.
[3:07] <Eztuzt> None at all
[3:07] <ClassiestMedic> yes
[3:07] <Eagle> It'd be like pennies.
[3:07] <Eagle> :P
[3:08] <LanternGhost> No currency please
[3:08] <Gyro> You also don't need as much of it as iron.
[3:08] <Zoronian> CURRECNY PLZ
[3:08] <LanternGhost> We just need to trade
[3:08] <Zoronian> make gold currency
[3:08] <ClassiestMedic> yeah

[3:08] <ClassiestMedic> Lol
[3:08] <Zoronian> GOLD = RANK, CURRENCY, AND POWER!
[3:08] <Eztuzt> Im assuming the trade process will go like this..
[3:08] <LanternGhost> Say if you want gold and I want iron
[3:08] <Zoronian> Samething irl.
[3:08] <Eztuzt> "You got the iron?"
[3:08] <Gyro> Gold is useless
[3:08] <ClassiestMedic> yes
[3:08] <LanternGhost> We could trade gold for iron
[3:08] <Eztuzt> Hell yeah I do. I don disrespect, man"
[3:08] <LanternGhost> Or iron for coal
[3:08] <Eztuzt> "You got the coal?
[3:08] <Zoronian> Who would trade gold for iron..
[3:08] <Wervyn> See, the problem with currency and any of this crap is that you can trivially mine the stuff yourself to begin with. The only things in the game that are particularly rare are diamonds.
[3:08] <Zoronian> o-o
[3:08] <ClassiestMedic> or gold for a massive amount of sand
[3:08] <k96spy> i accidently ignited 5 tnt blocks in the middle of my house in the middle of the night
[3:08] <Iguana> I'd totally be a blacksmith.
[3:08] <Eztuzt> And then they throw things at eachother

[3:09] <ClassiestMedic> Or steal from shests
[3:09] <Zoronian> then I'd steal it and be like "OH YEAH, BITCH!"
[3:09] <LanternGhost> We will trade materials
[3:09] <ClassiestMedic> chests

[3:09] <Iguana> Dude.
[3:09] <Eztuzt> How will trading happen anyway
[3:09] <Iguana> We need drug dealers.
[3:09] <Eztuzt> Will we throw it at eachother
[3:09] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[3:09] <LanternGhost> I drop something Eztuzt
[3:09] <ClassiestMedic> press q
[3:09] <Malikat> are there any spoiler tags for the minecraft forum?
[3:09] <Zoronian> LMFAO
[3:09] <Iguana> Shrubs is my substitute for weed.
[3:09] <LanternGhost> and you drop it
[3:09] <Eztuzt> I think we should right click on them and it opens up the menu
[3:09] <Astroman> Minecraft RP
[3:09] <Eztuzt> Or something like that
[3:09] <LanternGhost> Nah
[3:09] <Eagle> EAGLE initiated trade with EZTUZT
[3:09] <Astroman> Got that's going to suck
[3:09] <LanternGhost> Its about trust
[3:10] <Iguana> 420 - NOW WITH MORE MINECRAFT.
[3:10] <Zoronian> I want to have ass holes running around stealing everyones shit
[3:10] <k96spy> i would just stalk people and pop up randomly on their path
[3:10] <Astroman> God*
[3:10] <Zoronian> when they trade/log off.
[3:10] <ClassiestMedic> I will!
[3:10] <LanternGhost> if you don't trust them lock them in a room and do the trade
[3:10] <k96spy> then dissapear
[3:10] <LanternGhost> They try to run just kill them
[3:10] <ClassiestMedic> ^_^
[3:10] <eritz> i want to see people come up with creative ways to protect their stockpiles
[3:10] <Iguana> Just have an indestructable room.
[3:10] <Eztuzt> Heh
[3:10] <Eztuzt> Trade rooms
[3:10] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[3:10] <Eztuzt> Solid diamond
[3:10] <ClassiestMedic> Armored rooms
[3:10] <Iguana> With a 1 block, and half block ontop of that
[3:10] <Malikat> Could a forum dork answer me if there's spoiler tags on the main minecraft forums?
[3:10] <Eztuzt> Holes in the wall
[3:10] <Zoronian> MP = GOOOOD
[3:10] <LanternGhost> Have a friend near you for a trade so if they try to scam you have him step in
[3:10] <Eztuzt> Someone walls both in
[3:10] <Zoronian> Or.
[3:10] <Iguana> And you drop thru the half a block slit.
[3:10] <Zoronian> Make a clan
[3:10] <Eztuzt> With the ceiling open
[3:10] <Zoronian> get the clan to raid people
[3:10] <Eztuzt> AQrchers waiting above
[3:10] <Zoronian> make a clan bank
[3:10] <LanternGhost> Really all of this trading and clan things just require you to be smart
[3:10] <Zoronian> hire guards
[3:10] <Eztuzt> A hole between two 3x3 rooms
[3:10] <eritz> i'm partial to underwater vaults
[3:10] <LanternGhost> think about a good way to do it
[3:10] <Zoronian> then be like OHYEAH!
[3:10] <Animator> Zoronian, you're late on that idea.
[3:11] <LanternGhost> same goes for hiding chests
[3:11] <Iguana> GOOD THING I'M ON A TS3 CHANNEL.
[3:11] <Zoronian> I know..
[3:11] <Animator> We have an entire forum dedicated to that.
[3:11] <LanternGhost> also trade room would be amazing
[3:11] <eritz> hard to find, even harder to get to
[3:11] <Iguana> I should make a TS3 channel dedicated to indev.
[3:11] <Zoronian> I've been thinking of this idea since this game came out..
[3:11] <Iguana> :D
[3:11] <LanternGhost> Glass for windows
[3:11] <LanternGhost> And have a body guard
[3:11] <Eztuzt> Nah
[3:11] <Eztuzt> Trade room:
[3:11] <Eztuzt> Shs
[3:11] <Eztuzt> Ima ASCII it
[3:11] <LanternGhost> Go for it
[3:11] <ylt> wonder how long it'll take for d3 to do new mp xD
[3:11] <Eztuzt> DDD
[3:11] <Malikat> i think the best way to trade is to leave what you don't want on his cold dead corpse
[3:11] <Eztuzt> D D
[3:11] <Eztuzt> Or not.
[3:11] <Zoronian> I don't want infdev thought.
[3:11] <LanternGhost> DDD
[3:11] <LanternGhost> D D
[3:11] <LanternGhost> DDD
[3:11] <Zoronian> it takes up too many resources.
[3:11] <LanternGhost> D D
[3:11] <LanternGhost> DDD
[3:11] <Zoronian> and the fog doesn't work correctly.
[3:11] <Eztuzt> Well
[3:11] <LanternGhost> D D
[3:12] <LanternGhost> lol
[3:12] <k96spy> i would build traps for people
[3:12] <Malikat> Zoronian: infinite will be a map size.
[3:12] <Eztuzt> a 5x3 diamond-plated building
[3:12] <Zoronian> I know..
[3:12] <LanternGhost> lol
[3:12] <Eztuzt> With a single hole inbetween two rooms
[3:12] <Zoronian> But it takes up too many resources and the fog does not work.
[3:12] <Eagle> Moat of lava surrounding a 3x3 block of adamantine with a chest inside of it
[3:12] <Eztuzt> And two entrances, blocked ff by diamond
[3:12] <k96spy> i mean for them not to kill them mind you
[3:12] <Steel> i'll try to create the Mordor
[3:12] <Steel> in infinite
[3:12] <Iguana> I so totally just registered #tradehouse
[3:12] <Eztuzt> Someone monitors teh trade
[3:12] <Malikat> Zoronian: then don't play on infinite servers.
[3:12] <Zoronian> Thats why you should stick to the multiworld system.
[3:12] <Eztuzt> And two people trade
[3:12] <Eagle> surrounded by infinite amounts of spiders
[3:12] <Wervyn> Eztuzt: I'm actually thinking of a complicated lock system.
[3:12] <Zoronian> Don't do a lock system..
[3:12] <Zoronian> god that would suck
[3:12] <Eztuzt> Something liek I thought of
[3:13] <Wervyn> Two separated rooms with a window between them.
[3:13] <Zoronian> it would defeat the purpose of the game.
[3:13] <Eagle> OR: The server just saves the inventory of whoever plays on it
[3:13] <Eztuzt> Was thinking of*
[3:13] <Malikat> Zoronian: it /is/ a multiworld system
[3:13] <Zoronian> I know..
[3:13] <Zoronian> but I want to loot players
[3:13] <Malikat> it's just that each world is centered on the players
[3:13] <Zoronian> who hide there stuff
[3:13] <Eztuzt> The monitoring guy/guard locks them in
[3:13] <Wervyn> And boxes, where you throw in the item you want to trade, so each player can see it.
[3:13] <Malikat> instead of being predefined borders.
[3:13] * Roujo|Away is now known as Roujo
[3:13] <Zoronian> Make it like an option in the config
[3:13] <Eztuzt> And they dont get out until trade is good
[3:13] <Zoronian> like allow locks = false or true
[3:13] <Iguana> Seriously though, a TS3 would be pretty helpful for indev.
[3:13] <Iguana> On the fly communications = ftw
[3:13] <Zoronian> or admin locks = false or true
[3:13] <k96spy> im not looking forward to when torches only last a set amount of time
[3:13] <Wervyn> And Zoronian, this is using current indev physics, not a new lock entity.
[3:13] <k96spy> before going out
[3:13] <Zoronian> I don't want any locks.
[3:14] <Fractal> Blocks can only be destroyed by the creator,
[3:14] <Vis{AFK}> Alright
[3:14] * Vis{AFK} is now known as Vis{ME2}
[3:14] <Zoronian> unless admins make a bank
[3:14] <Eztuzt> Never fractal!
[3:14] <Vis{ME2}> I need some help here.
[3:14] <Fractal> but that doesnt have to apply to allservers Eztuzt
[3:14] <Iguana> Maybe locks, and a f ew hits to break it open.
[3:14] <Wervyn> Anyway, water driven trigger that drops your item down into a containing room, and then to a receiving room when both triggers have been pulled.
[3:14] <Vis{ME2}> I'm about to go into the Omega 4 Relay
[3:14] <Zoronian> and instead of full server chat
[3:14] <Vis{ME2}> I have all of my crew loyal
[3:14] <Zoronian> it should be like runescape
[3:14] <Juraka> uh Fractal, what happens if I encase your house in my blocks then?
[3:14] <Wervyn> Then you go down the stairs and pick up your trade item.
[3:14] <Zoronian> and have in location chat.
[3:14] <Vis{ME2}> I have my ship's shields 100%
[3:14] <Vis{ME2}> Who do I send where?
[3:14] <Zoronian> and a /yell command
[3:14] <Malikat> Zoronian: it's not going to be an MMO
[3:14] <Vis{ME2}> And, like, who is my team?
[3:14] <k96spy> i need to join a clan is what i need
[3:15] <Eztuzt> Malikat, that would be pretty good
[3:15] <Malikat> the server that can handle more than 30 players will be very rare.
[3:15] <Eagle> The chest is surrounded by a maze of tnt blocks, only one of them is a fake with a chest behind it, you have to destroy the right tnt to find the chest behind it
[3:15] <Iguana> Asiekierka made a Minecraft mod for speaking within walls. Messages don't transmit thru walls.
[3:15] <Fractal> Juraka: true dat. Whatever happens, MP is going to be mental
[3:15] <Eztuzt> Have your chat only visible in a certain radius
[3:15] <eritz> 30 players -at one time-
[3:15] <Iguana> I hope indev will be like that. :D

[3:15] <Malikat> eritz: quite right.
[3:15] <Konogan> Yeah, local chat.
[3:15] <Zoronian> I have a VPS that can handle atleast 50-60 players.

[3:16] <Iguana> I thought you guys cleared the rules.
[3:16] <Eztuzt> Still
[3:16] <Fractal> Juraka: nevertheless, locked chests are needed, if players can die, but how prevent a similar thing?
[3:16] <Iguana> But if it's still there, then I got it.

[3:16] <Vis{ME2}> I mean, large maps cause server lag with alot of people on
[3:16] <k96spy> i think that server creators should make it so that everyone has to have fog set to a certain level

[3:16] <eritz> honestly, i can't wait to see what minecraft's magic system looks like
[3:17] <Eztuzt> Im not expecting magic
[3:17] <Juraka> Fractal: Locked chests are indeed needed... but then you could use chests as unbreakable walls? hmm...
[3:17] <Vis{ME2}> Infinite maps and people being far away will be hella laggy.
[3:17] <Iguana> k96, what about laggy people?
[3:17] <Iguana> Like me?
[3:17] <eritz> magic is going to happen
[3:17] <Juraka> my first idea is to just make chests take a super long time to mine away
[3:17] * charrr is now known as charrr|AFK
[3:17] <Success> I thought there was going to be rituals not magic
[3:17] <eritz> notch said so
[3:17] <Malikat> Vis: not laggy at all
[3:17] <Juraka> but that doesn't help a whole lot

[3:17] * William_Owen is now known as Leoru
[3:17] <Vis{ME2}> Having people be far apart on the infinite maps will make the server very laggy.
[3:17] <Malikat> Vis: the issue won't be that the processor won't be able to handle it, it will be that the system will run out of memory to store the world sections that are being accessed
[3:17] <Leoru> Hey
[3:17] <eritz> i want to see versatile enchanting
[3:17] <Malikat> Vis{ME2}: therefore it won't lag, it will just CRASH.
[3:18] <Iguana> I've vowed not to use infinite maps on my servers. :D
[3:18] <eritz> i want to be able to do many, many things
[3:18] <Vis{ME2}> Erm, no.
[3:18] <Malikat> unless the server is limited to available memory (ie 6gb) divided by max memory per player (32mb) max players
[3:18] <Eztuzt> I say we need to add more end-game material before we deal with magic

[3:18] <Success> This game made me want to learn java
[3:18] <Malikat> 6 gb / 32 mb = 192 players
[3:18] <eritz> end-game?
[3:18] <eritz> end-game?!
[3:18] <Iguana> 25 KILL STREAK?!
[3:18] <Eztuzt> As in once your set up and stable
[3:18] <eritz> what exactly does end-game look like in minecraft?

[3:19] <Juraka> RUNNING RIOT
[3:19] <Eztuzt> And equipped with diamonds
[3:19] <k96spy> i realy think there should be able to be a set fog level and people can make it fogier but not less foggy
[3:19] <Zoronian> Is notch going to charge for expansions?
[3:19] <Snowman> No
[3:19] <Iguana> ^Nope.
[3:19] <Eztuzt> Have a 200-block how castle
[3:19] <Iguana> Ohshit, ninja'd
[3:19] <Vis{ME2}> Zoronian: No sir.
[3:19] <Zoronian> Okay :D
[3:19] <Leoru> @Success: same here
[3:19] <Malikat> Vis{ME2}: current creative multiplayer only ever needs to load one section of map into memory. that map is not often more than 512x512x128
[3:19] <Snowman> You pay once and only once
[3:19] <Vis{ME2}> Actually
[3:19] <Vis{ME2}> In the future, I suppose it's possible.
[3:19] <Iguana> Notch is awesome like that.
[3:19] <Zoronian> Hopefully he doesn't.
[3:19] <Vis{ME2}> No, not for you
[3:19] <Eztuzt> If you buy now, you get all future expansions
[3:19] <eritz> he promised he wouldn't
[3:19] <Vis{ME2}> for people that buy in the future
[3:19] <Iguana> Where do I see Minecraft in 2010...OHWAIT
[3:19] <Zoronian> He might become greedy :(
[3:19] <eritz> people would get mega-pissed if he did
[3:19] <Eztuzt> Nah
[3:19] <eritz> so he probably won't
[3:19] <Vis{ME2}> Zoronian: By purchasing the game you are bound in a contract.
[3:19] <Eztuzt> He wont get greedy

[3:19] <Malikat> Vis{ME2}: a 512x512x128 static map will take the same amount of memory as FOUR players that are completely seperated on a dynamic map.
[3:19] <Iguana> Where do I see Minecraft in 2012...
[3:19] <Zoronian> Hey runescape used to be a one time charge.
[3:19] <Vis{ME2}> It's not as simple as changing.
[3:20] <Zoronian> Now look..
[3:20] <Iguana> Lies.
[3:20] <Iguana> Give me proof.
[3:20] <Yourself> that's at least 64 MB with lighting
[3:20] <Eztuzt> Notch is a nice guy, he wouldnt do that
[3:20] <Zoronian> $5 a month and they don't listen to the players.
[3:20] <Vis{ME2}> Malikat: You realize that the level has to handle more than just players?
[3:20] <Zoronian> SURE IS CHANGE AROUND HERE
[3:20] <Vis{ME2}> Malikat: And, on top of that, generation?
[3:20] <Vis{ME2}> Malikat: Block changes?
[3:20] <Malikat> Vis: those are not memory issues, those are processor issues.
[3:20] <Zoronian> I hope it doesn't change.
[3:20] <Success> I really think that if everyone plays on one map on infdev, it should be divided into sub sections, when you move so many chunks out of range of server one, you have to wait to connect to another server so it doesn't make massive lag rape
[3:20] <k96spy> does anyone here actualy believe in 2012
[3:20] <Malikat> my point is that maximum players will be limited by memory allocated to the server.
[3:20] <Eztuzt> Nah
[3:20] <DimJim> i believe in 2012
[3:21] <eritz> i believe 2012 is going to happen
[3:21] <eritz> right after 2011
[3:21] <Eztuzt> 2012 has nothign to do with the end of the world
[3:21] <Animator> http://www.livestream.com/blockcast Always by Erasure is playing. THERE WILL BE NO SHAME.
[3:21] <Zoronian> I like this game I just can't wait to see a multiplayer system that is based on currecny, building, cooking, drinking, and stuff.
[3:21] <DimJim> there has to be something between 2011 and 2013
[3:21] <DimJim> DAMN YOU ERITZ

[3:21] <Eztuzt> I dont even think 2012 will happen
[3:21] <Juraka> lol 2012
[3:21] <Malikat> if you cannot allocate more than 1gb of memory to the server, you CANNOT EVER have more than 32 players.
[3:21] <Eztuzt> Well skip from 2011 to 2013
[3:21] <Success> My idea is better
[3:21] <Snowman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymZPPCLQaTc
[3:21] <Success> Then you can have tons of players

[3:21] <Malikat> software won't change it.
[3:21] <Vis{ME2}> Malikat: He's talked about it, K?
[3:22] <Malikat> no amount of optimization will trim down MEMORY usage for storing the MAP.
[3:22] <LanternGhost> Any news?
[3:22] <Gyro> >runescape used to be false
[3:22] <LanternGhost> Lol
[3:22] <Malikat> unless he trims the size of the local world by limiting the max fog distance.
[3:22] <Gyro> Wrong.
[3:22] <Animator> J is before this, K?
[3:22] <Success> Thats why you divide it into parts
[3:22] <Gyro> om
[3:22] <Gyro> well I meant to greentext "runescape used to be fun"
[3:22] <Gyro> and that is false
[3:22] <Malikat> optimization will make the server less /processor/ heavy

[3:22] <Success> Kind link in the old animal crossing where there are acres
[3:22] <Vis{ME2}> Malikat: Sure, memory is a problem, and what Notch is planning to do for that is only storing the areas that were recently changed or frequented. Spawns, near distance, and the closest things to users.
[3:22] <Success> like*
[3:22] <k96spy> actualy he said hes going to make it act like a fog of war so that only the tings around your charcter exists
[3:22] <Gyro> I played it in... what was it, 2002? 2003? and it was *terrible*
[3:23] <Vis{ME2}> Otherwise it overwrites them.
[3:23] <Vis{ME2}> He's said that in the blog, too.
[3:23] <Malikat> Vis{ME2} that is HARD DRIVE.
[3:23] <Vis{ME2}> :\
[3:23] <Wervyn> Vis: I think Malikat is talking about the memory space required for that active area.
[3:23] <Malikat> i am talking about random access memory, RAM, DIMMs

[3:23] <Success> NO THIS IS PATRICK
[3:23] * smn is now known as smn`off
[3:23] <Yourself> will the server necessarily have to keep the entire local area that the client can see in memory?
[3:24] <Malikat> Yourself: i believe, yes.
[3:24] <Gyro> Actually
[3:24] <k96spy> no this is BANANAAAAAAAAAAAA

[3:24] <Yourself> but for what purpose?
[3:24] * AndrewPH|Morrowind is now known as AndrewPH
[3:24] <Vis{ME2}> Wervyn: That's aweful specific for our converstation: after all, the server will be laggy without optimization.
[3:24] <Yourself> oh, physics
[3:24] <Gyro> You could read from and write to swap
[3:24] <Wervyn> I wonder if there's a practical way to do a distributed model instead.
[3:24] <eritz> fuck yeah, morrowind
[3:24] <Gyro> it'd be slow as fuck though
[3:24] <Malikat> physics, haxchecking, etc
[3:24] <Vis{ME2}> Physics are client side.
[3:24] <Success> Is there any word on how to MP Infdev will work, one huge server, or player hosted servers?
[3:24] <LanternGhost> player
[3:24] <Gyro> Player hosted servers, Success. This is old news.

[3:25] <LanternGhost> I don't want MC to be an MMO
[3:25] <Malikat> Vis{ME2}: yeah, if you want to get totally hacked. And the server needs to keep the local area in the memory to recieve the client's reports of what the physics did.
[3:25] <k96spy> and the things within claim flag
[3:25] <LanternGhost> although having 32 player servers would be cool
[3:25] <LanternGhost> or 64
[3:25] <RocketSquid> I was wondering how that would work. I'm hoping to host an infdev server when it comes out

[3:25] <Vis{ME2}> Yourself: Ah, Ok.
[3:25] <AndrewPH> Candlejack is a pretty cool gu
[3:25] <Gyro> 128 player servers might even be possible.
[3:25] <Success> I dont want to play on someones server and gett attached to it
[3:25] <simplejack> anyone could host a perma server
[3:25] <Malikat> Yourself: i'm going to stop responding to Vis now, i recommend you do too. any time he gets in an argument, he goes absolutely batshit and starts insulting everyone who disagrees.

[3:26] <Yourself> i was the one that wrote up the nice wiki article on the network protocol after all :P
[3:26] <Vis{ME2}> Yourself: Spacebuilds, no water, whatever could all be in the .properties.
[3:26] <Malikat> Wervyn: i think distributed serving would be great
[3:26] <Success> When are slimes coming lol, That will be funny
[3:26] <Wervyn> Yeah, I'm not sure of a good way to do it though.
[3:26] <Gyro> Yourself, what?
[3:26] <simplejack> spacebuilds? like floating maps?
[3:26] <Gyro> That sounds
[3:27] <k96spy> i think a taller chair would be nice
[3:27] <Vis{ME2}> simplejack: No gravity?
[3:27] <simplejack> oh
[3:27] <Gyro> That sounds slow as hell
[3:27] <Gyro> god damnit Notch
[3:27] <simplejack> damn that would be...interesting
[3:27] <Wervyn> And there's the hacking issue as well. Anything you trust to the client is, simply put, untrustworthy.
[3:27] <k96spy> my chair is like a foot off the ground
[3:27] <simplejack> you'd have to be able to place blocks anywhere though

[3:27] <Vis{ME2}> Well, I would hope it would be like valve: variables for gravity and stuff
[3:27] <Malikat> Wervyn: just have a primary server that keeps track of what node servers there are, and tracks the map changes. the player connects to the primary server, and is handed off to the node server that has the local area containing the spawn in active memory

[3:27] <Gyro> Sending each player's new position to the server every few frames must be a huge network resource hog.

[3:28] <Yourself> Malikat's idea is interesting, but i wonder how well that'd work near node boundaries
[3:28] <Wervyn> Malikat: Mm, and then communicate with the server using deltas.
[3:28] <Malikat> As he defines a new local area, he is either defined as a new local area on that node, or he is handed off to the node containing his new local area
[3:28] <Yourself> i mean, you could make something that works
[3:28] <Yourself> i just wonder about the logistics there
[3:28] <Malikat> Yourself: yeah, that's what i was thinking would be odd.

[3:30] <Wervyn> Yeah. What I'm trying to get my head around is how you can do this so that the server doesn't have to maintain each player's local area in its own active memory. And what happens with players in intersecting areas.
[3:30] <k96spy> yah have bases
[3:30] <LanternGhost> Gmod time
[3:30] <Malikat> and nodes could be ranked on bandwidth so that the more populated areas go to the nodes on the FIOS network and the one way out in bumblefuck tennesee goes to the guy who is on DSL
[3:30] <LanternGhost> TTT
[3:30] <Yourself> thechris, that's completely irrelevant and stupid, but his tongue could just be really smooth

[3:31] <Success> Would that work well?
[3:31] <LG_Legacy> See this is why i'm not going to ask
[3:31] <Malikat> you wouldn't have visual or anything across the world boundaries, same issues that make me h8 multiworld

[3:31] <Malikat> true
[3:32] <k96spy> what is this MAG?
[3:32] <Yourself> separated by enough ocean
[3:32] <Malikat> but you could still have combat exploits on the border
[3:32] <Yourself> and not allow players to build close to the borders
[3:32] <LG_Legacy> Because i am going to just go ahead and wait till the public version
[3:32] <thechris> a epic game thats to epic for the xbox360
[3:32] <Malikat> have that dickweed that dodges arrows and attacks by skipping across the border

[3:33] <Malikat> Yourself: oh man, i just had an image of that sort of ocean
[3:33] <Wervyn> I'm hoping and expecting to see different terrain types in general.
[3:33] <Steel> and attacker would use creeper catapult
[3:33] <Malikat> and working and building on the shore for days
[3:34] <Wervyn> So oceans are of course one of them.
[3:34] <Yourself> Malikat, i had an idea for that that i relayed to notch a few days ago
[3:34] <Malikat> and suddenly seeing a bridge slowly building towards you
[3:34] <Yourself> the map height
[3:34] <mcbackstory> I want to make Blade Runner Los Angeles in Infdev, no lie
[3:34] * Lickpost (Here@82.198.103.15) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[3:34] <k96spy> Steel:that would be epic
[3:34] <ylt> occean full of creepers? xD
[3:34] <Yourself> each map chunk would only be 128 blocks in height
[3:34] <mcbackstory> Too much to ask for flying cars? :D
[3:34] <Yourself> but could be adjusted by some offset
[3:34] <Steel> creeper are adapting
[3:34] <Steel> there changing
[3:34] <Success> Deserts would be cool
[3:34] <Yourself> so a neighboring block could have its base a few blocks higher
[3:34] <Wervyn> Doesn't seem that hard though, DF style worldmap generator for overall terrain, and then generate each block as you encounter it.
[3:34] <Steel> they have the ability to be deep-charges
[3:34] <Malikat> oh, i see
[3:34] <Yourself> so you could actually get really tall mountains
[3:34] <k96spy> soon creepers will be flying
[3:34] <mcbackstory> Has Notch said anything about changing the max map height? That way we can get some really epic mnts?
[3:35] <thechris> i want land mines, but that might be to much...
[3:35] * Tamsyn (Mibbit@76.177.107.60) has joined #minecraft
[3:35] <Malikat> the map is never taller than 128 from top limit to bottom limit
[3:35] <Yourself> the one problem is that it's kind of counterintuitive building tall things
[3:35] <Malikat> but the z coordinate of the limit is dynamic
[3:35] <Wervyn> Don't know about matching up the borders but that's also workable.
[3:35] <Yourself> since you could be building horizontally and run into an invisible wall

[3:35] <thechris> thats smart
[3:35] <Malikat> you could try to write exception codes for that
[3:35] <IDTL> haha he says he's gonna ask people from IRC to test
[3:36] * Bobo (Bobo@ool-18b9e38f.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:36] <Yourself> but if it came down to it, that would avoid all the technical issues with map depth and still allow dynamic height
[3:36] <Emperor> >invite people from IRC to help test software
[3:36] <IDTL> and the number of people in here almost doubles
[3:36] <Emperor> oh, hello
[3:36] <Steel> it would be cool to create creeper fashionned mine
[3:36] <Malikat> since you already have code into place to adjust the limits
[3:36] <k96spy> then when someone walks over him they blow up
[3:36] <keret> ya lol
[3:36] <Steel> you step on them and BOOm
[3:36] <Malikat> you could have the limit adjust again if that issue is coming into play
[3:36] <keret> we all want to mp
[3:36] <Yourself> for the most part
[3:36] <Malikat> as you approach a border, the adjacent height max could pop up to meet you
[3:37] <Wervyn> Unless the minimum height is low enough in that chunk that that doesn't work.
[3:37] <thechris> stupid timezones makes my ealiest time on would be his 10pm
[3:37] <k96spy> who ever makes a creeper mine gets me as a slave in multiplayer

[3:37] <Malikat> sorry.
[3:37] <Emperor> yeah i REALLY wanna make a sky scrapper
[3:37] <Yourself> since it would make the game way cooler, since 128 isn't a lot to work with

[3:38] <k96spy> and ill do whatever im told to do even if it means jumping off cliffs

[3:38] <Wervyn> Yeah, I thought that was the current implementation plan, did it change?
[3:38] <Yourself> i don't know enough about what's actually going on in the code to make any better suggestions
[3:38] <Yourself> like whether it'd be possible to dynamically resize a chunk's height
[3:38] <Malikat> i feel like the code whisperer sometimes
[3:38] <k96spy> when does notch get on anyways?
[3:39] <Emperor> i dont see how raising the height limit would effect anything at all
[3:39] <Emperor> considering it can be so deep on deep levels
[3:39] <Malikat> k96spy: it's about 2 in the morning for notch right now
[3:39] <Emperor> and how the height wont be filled unless you fill it
[3:39] <k96spy> wow realy were he live
[3:39] <Malikat> expect him in like, 8 or 10 hours
[3:39] <Malikat> sweden?
[3:39] <Steel> in sweden

[4:41] <Darke> Eox, there would be a VERY small number of people
[4:41] <UnknownX> What if you can't find any?
[4:41] <rcfighter> The more people there are in the multiplayer beta, the more there are to find/report bugs.
[4:41] <k96spy> beat you again
[4:41] <Zelitor> Hello
[4:41] <Solece> Wait wait
[4:41] <Darke> Im betting that Notch would pick people he trusts, not random people

[4:41] <Kaizo> 15450 people have bought the game
[4:41] <NotEagle> ...
[4:42] <Keltros> hey when you guys test multiplayer make sure someone records it id like to see it in action. since my comp cant handle infinite maps yet
[4:42] <Darke> Why Malikat?
[4:42] <Solece> Keltros
[4:42] <Dark_Force> did chariot get the MP beta?
[4:42] <rcfighter> If malik gets it, hes probably going to livestream it
[4:42] <Kokopure> because he's linked to Mali from his personal blog
[4:42] <Dark_Force> hes awesome
[4:42] <Solece> Its not gonna be much different...
[4:42] <Kokopure> and yeah
[4:42] <Kokopure> the livestreaks
[4:42] <CrazySpai> NO ONE HAS BETA YET
[4:42] <Darke> So?
[4:42] <Kokopure> livestreams
[4:42] <Keltros> ah awsome!
[4:42] <Vis{ME2}> UnknownX fo sho, Puyo and Siise*li, Darke, eagle, LG_Legacy Iguana, LKA, Redshift, Snowman.. underd0g, and he's already invited me.
[4:42] <Darke> CrazySpai, we know

[4:42] <CrazySpai> SHUIOUT
[4:42] <Kokopure> Malikat. never livestreak.
[4:42] <Dark_Force> Sorry man
[4:42] <Kokopure> promise me.
[4:42] <Vis{ME2}> Just as a little wrap up
[4:42] <Vis{ME2}> of all the sure-ins
[4:42] <LKA> oh it was vis that set off my notify
[4:42] <Darke> Vis{ME2}, why would he pick me?
[4:42] <LG_Legacy> Wut
[4:42] <Darke> He doesn't know me
[4:42] <Konogan> We got lucky that everyone who bought the game didn't come to the IRC >_<
[4:42] <Eagle> We've been here the longest.
[4:42] <LG_Legacy> I didn't get anything
[4:42] <Vis{ME2}> No, but you've been a member of the community for a very long time.
[4:42] <rcfighter> People are guessing who will get it.
[4:42] <Darke> Well yeah
[4:42] <Eagle> :P
[4:42] <Kaizo> i used to come here
[4:43] <Kokopure> anyway I would be really surprised if everyone on IRC got to test it.
[4:43] <LG_Legacy> And?
[4:43] <k96spy> who is going to have a live video feed of MP survival
[4:43] <LKA> what's going on down here
[4:43] <Kokopure> really pleasantly surprised, sure.
[4:43] <rcfighter> Mass highlights follow.
[4:43] <Darke> Kokopure, they won't
[4:43] <Redshift> what what?
[4:43] <Vis{ME2}> I only talked to notch about the beta before he started publicising it: that's why he invited me.
[4:43] <Solece> Of course the hard-core fans are going to read notch's blog everyday then come ot the IRC
[4:43] <Snowman> Vis{ME2}, I hear my name?
[4:43] <underd0g> Wait, what? Me?
[4:43] <Vis{ME2}> Sorry, redk95
[4:43] <Kokopure> don't you crush my dreams Darke D:
[4:43] <Eagle> Kokopure, he did that with the initial creative mode multiplayer
[4:43] <Vis{ME2}> Yes, underd0g D: Snowman
[4:43] <Darke> Anyways, do half of you mibbiters realize that it is 12PM in wherever the hell Notch lives?
[4:43] <Kokopure> he did, Eagle??
[4:43] <Vis{ME2}> You've been here for the longest times
[4:43] <Kokopure> ooooh :3
[4:43] <k96spy> i want the link to that livestream
[4:43] <Eagle> of course there was only like 20 people on the channel
[4:43] <Eagle> back then
[4:43] <Snowman> AH yeah
[4:43] <Darke> And that multiplayer probably won't even be tested for a few days
[4:43] <Kokopure> ahh.
[4:43] <Kokopure> right right.
[4:43] <Vis{ME2}> Hahaha, my first time through there was eighteen
[4:43] <Darke> And you are all wasting your time
[4:43] <LG_Legacy> Wait i'm invited?
[4:43] <Vis{ME2}> And annihilatorbeta harassed me :(
[4:43] <LanternGhost> ...

[4:43] <Darke> Eagle, those were the days
[4:43] <LanternGhost> Any news?
[4:43] <Vis{ME2}> LG_Legacy: Not for sure, don't take my word
[4:43] <Eagle> Yup.
[4:44] <Dark_Force> notch works fast
[4:44] <Kokopure> Notch doesn't work fast.
[4:44] <Vis{ME2}> But Notch would choose you over me, I hope.
[4:44] <Dark_Force> like, really fast
[4:44] <Dark_Force> kinda
[4:44] <Darke> Back before the channel and the forums were a spamfest... :)
[4:44] <Kokopure> there needs to be a new word for how fast he works.
[4:44] <Keltros> catch u guys later!
[4:44] <Kokopure> Notch works ... Notch.

[4:44] <Eagle> I remember back when the forums were horrible
[4:44] <Vis{ME2}> heh, when conversations could be had without flames
[4:44] <Vis{ME2}> And the forums were shitts
[4:44] <Kokopure> were those people really only here for MP testing?
[4:44] <Kokopure> seriously, what losers
[4:44] <Eagle> Like
[4:44] <Darke> Eagle, they were the best before Minecraft got really popular
[4:44] <Eagle> really horrible
[4:44] <UnknownX> I still remember being number 693 to buy the game :P
[4:44] * Varriount is now known as FlistBot
[4:44] <Eagle> Yup
[4:44] <k96spy> uhh again i heard mention of a livestream of MP is this true if so give me link
[4:44] <Eagle> I was number like
[4:44] <Darke> Back in the first 5 months or so of the game
[4:44] <Kokopure> I was definitely some thousandth :<
[4:45] <Kokopure> I was probably 13 or 14 thousandish.
[4:45] <Darke> I bought the game in its second month
[4:45] <Eagle> 200 something to buy the game, because I had problems with paypal
[4:45] <LKA> I dunno what number I was
[4:45] <Darke> I found Minecraft while looking for interesting physics engines
[4:45] <LKA> but it was before half blocks iirc

[4:45] <Eagle> Oh hey look NotEagle left
[4:45] <UnknownX> I could have been 400 something but i didn't want to buy the game yet
[4:45] <redk95> Vis its fine, but is there some requirement that you have to meet to be chosen or is it just luck
[4:45] <Eagle> that guy sure is attractive
[4:45] <Darke> redk95, he won't just be picking random people
[4:45] * revenant is now known as Fragshift
[4:45] <Dark_Force> open beta MP will be out VERY soon, if notch works at the speed of Notch
[4:45] <Darke> He will be picking people that he recognizes/knows from IRC
[4:45] * Fragshift is now known as Redmer
[4:46] * Redmer is now known as Fragshift
[4:46] <Vis{ME2}> redk95: I'd assume that the requirement is being part of the community? Being around for ~1 year?

[4:46] <Kokopure> I was in here when he was in here, once.
[4:46] <Darke> Also the new forums have brought in an influx of people obsessed with Notch
[4:46] <k96spy> me too
[4:46] * Fragshift is now known as revenant
[4:46] <Kokopure> I don't remember if I talked to him or not.
[4:46] <Vis{ME2}> I joined in May, myself, within 10 days of the game's big day
[4:46] <redk95> Ive been around for a little over that
[4:46] <Kaizo> It's 2:45 in Sweden
[4:46] <Kokopure> but, yeah, if he's not releasing it to everyone, I don't expect he'll release it to me
[4:46] <Kaizo> AM
[4:46] <Vis{ME2}> redk95: Liar. the game hasnt' been around for a year.

[4:47] <Vis{ME2}> Actually, it's surprising.
[4:47] <redk95> sometimes around then start of last summer
[4:47] <Kokopure> I BOUGHT THE GAME EIGHT YEARS AGO BEFORE IT WAS COOL
[4:47] <Darke> I joined in June I think
[4:47] <Vis{ME2}> When notch is on, he really does read what you say.
[4:47] <redk95> June I guess
[4:47] <Darke> Lemme check

[4:47] <Kaizo> 2:47 AM in Sweden

[4:47] <Darke> oh oops
[4:47] <Darke> Sorry
[4:47] <Eox> Switched from Carima.
[4:47] <LKA> I got this really cool dunce cap
[4:47] <k96spy> i made the universe just to join this game so there
[4:47] <UnknownX> I signed up for the forums around June 30th
[4:48] <Solece> Am I the only one that is playing minecraft right now? :3
[4:48] <Kaizo> LKA, idling is no longer effective
[4:48] <LKA> I just never have anything to say
[4:48] <LKA> Yeah I saw that update
[4:48] <LKA> But I can still joke about it >:
[4:48] <Vis{ME2}> I actually didn't purchase the game for like three months
[4:48] <Darke> Same
[4:48] <redk95> I wonder if he will do something awesome for the games firsat birthday
[4:48] <Vis{ME2}> because I still had the green card shit ringing in my head
[4:48] <LG_Legacy> I can has invite?
[4:48] <Solece> I purchased the day after i found out about it
[4:48] <Solece> Too much win to pass up
[4:48] <underd0g> I think I purchased the game after like 2 weeks
[4:48] <Darke> And I don't play Minecraft anymore for reasons that I am not allowed to discuss in this channel
[4:48] <Darke> Multiplayer that is
[4:48] <Vis{ME2}> LG_Legacy: If he invites me and not you, I will give you my position.
[4:48] <underd0g> Or less than that
[4:48] <LG_Legacy> Lol
[4:48] <LanternGhost> Hey guys
[4:48] <Lukisod> howdy all
[4:48] <LanternGhost> Heres how inviting will work
[4:48] <Vis{ME2}> And I would head to anal surgery, as I would shit a house
[4:48] <Eagle> I stopped playing multiplayer once hax ruined it for me. :/
[4:48] <LKA> pretty much everybody in my circle of bros bought/had the game gifted to them so we could play survival together
[4:49] <Darke> Eagle, hacks and custom servers
[4:49] <LanternGhost> notch comes in and says "Hey guys anyone want to test multi survival"?
[4:49] <AndrewPH> Eagle, we should play on my vanilla server
[4:49] <LanternGhost> People say yea
[4:49] <Eagle> Yup
[4:49] <Kaizo> I hope to get in as a Squid clan ambassador
[4:49] <LanternGhost> he says X amount of people are selected
[4:49] <PixelEater> i have a question
[4:49] <LanternGhost> sorry for the rest
[4:49] <Vis{ME2}> Hah, it's amazing
[4:49] <Darke> LanternGhost, doubt it
[4:49] <UnknownX> Everyone guesses a number and everyone close to it gets to play
[4:49] <LanternGhost> those X amount of people just join Notchs server
[4:49] <Vis{ME2}> Custom Servers and hacks are a completely different game
[4:49] <Vis{ME2}> I remember one map
[4:49] <PixelEater> when infdev becomes indev, will infinite maps be an OPTION?
[4:49] <Darke> Yup
[4:49] <LanternGhost> No special invites
[4:49] <LanternGhost> nothing
[4:49] <Vis{ME2}> I built this bridge to a hill
[4:49] <Vis{ME2}> and there were trees
[4:49] <LanternGhost> Its just who ever he feels like testing with
[4:49] <Vis{ME2}> and a clearing and I built a castle:
[4:49] <Darke> PixelEater, you will be able to limit the map dementions
[4:49] <Steel> i wonder what the tutorial will be
[4:49] <PixelEater> oh thank god
[4:49] <Steel> and what it will explain
[4:49] <Vis{ME2}> The big thing, people said "Good find" because nobody had flown there before.
[4:49] <redk95> Laternghost how do you knlow this?
[4:49] <Eagle> the first 10 people he sees on the userlist
[4:49] <LanternGhost> So if you don't get to test the first time don't worry as he will probably do more.
[4:50] <Kaizo> A game of guess a number decides beta testing?
[4:50] <LanternGhost> Because I bet that's how he will do it
[4:50] <LKA> it'll obviously be like when he did the last creative multi update
[4:50] <LKA> where we were still able to "kill" each other
[4:50] <Steel> eagle, then we should put a "a" in our names
[4:50] <LanternGhost> He is not going to randomly draw names from a hat and give out beta codes
[4:50] <LKA> and cause invisible griefers (lol)
[4:50] <LanternGhost> just select some people
[4:50] <Kaizo> I'm 7th
[4:50] <Darke> Eagle, really?
[4:50] <LanternGhost> tell them to download the client and try it out
[4:50] * Darke is now known as aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

[4:59] <Zach> Eagle spybot is an epic antispyware
[4:59] <Darkebrz> redk95, NORTON?
[4:59] <Zach> malware is just malware :P
[4:59] <Eagle> :P

[5:17] <Chezhead> I did that, it was some fun
[5:17] <Eagle> he found all of the bugs and won the beta test
[5:17] <DragoonEnRegalia> I can't tell if it's on or not.
[5:17] <Visiiri> I was the first to kill the Notchmob so he gave me access to a secret gamemode too
[5:17] <Blubex> this is my first time
[5:17] <Alpha> I am so confused...
[5:17] <Chezhead> Too many zombies after night 4, though, he needs to fix that
[5:17] <Visiiri> :D
[5:17] <Konogan> Sucks, I was AFK when he messaged me. :P
[5:17] <underd0g> No, multiplayer is not even finished yet. No one has played it
[5:17] <liq3> They're obviously teasing noobs.

[5:17] <Alpha> That's for added challenge, Chezhead
[5:17] <liq3> Notch is notoriously slow at coding imo. No way he got MP out yet.
[5:17] <Blubex> ya
[5:17] <Eagle> I was the first to trip over my own pile of dead bodies because a certain DARKE killed me like twenty times
[5:17] <DragoonEnRegalia> My ass if he would.

[5:18] <Visiiri> It's as if his life actually effects him
[5:18] <k96spy> malikat is that realy you on the webcam
[5:18] <UnknownX> Notch keeps shooting me :(
[5:18] <Visiiri> He can be fast and slow
[5:18] <Blubex> hahA
[5:18] <Chezhead> Maybe he shouold ramp the difficutly up after the 6th round, it's too steep a climb

[5:18] <LanternGhost> I want monster to be able to destroy blocks.
[5:18] <Steel> lol
[5:18] <Chezhead> But the new mega-TNT brick or whatever its called helped, too bad it set fire to my wood house
[5:18] <Visiiri> Chezhead: It's about stamina, not strength.
[5:18] <Steel> does anyone here really play ?
[5:18] <Chezhead> Yeah
[5:18] <underd0g> Steel, no
[5:18] <Visiiri> Chezhead: C4?
[5:18] <Eagle> Chezhead
[5:18] <LanternGhost> play what?
[5:19] <Eagle> I hate it
[5:19] <Eagle> it blew off my arm
[5:19] <Shwart> I play frequently...
[5:19] <Visiiri> Ahh shit
[5:19] <Visiiri> Your right arm?
[5:19] <Eagle> and all of the blood attracted a horde of zombies
[5:19] <Visiiri> Oh damn.
[5:19] <Eagle> and pretty much destroyed my town
[5:19] <LanternGhost> BOOMER!
[5:19] <Visiiri> I built a gate around my base in a day.
[5:19] <LanternGhost> *BLAAAH*
[5:19] <Chezhead> The fire-zombies were annoying, as well as the ghost ones... they kept going through my walls
[5:19] <Eagle> :/
[5:19] <Steel> Eagle, you'll be all right if you get PEELZ
[5:19] <Eagle> Of course.
[5:19] <VurtualRuler98> no no

[5:19] <Visiiri> and everyone rushed at me
[5:19] <VurtualRuler98> Do you know what's a good way to get adrenaline?
[5:19] <VurtualRuler98> Caffeine.
[5:19] <Visiiri> I died fast

[5:20] <Chezhead> The demon zombie was bad, though, it stepped on my house and almost wiped the entire thing out. Good thing I had a basement.
[5:20] <GardenGnome> hello everyone.
[5:20] <Eagle> You're missing the multiplayer
[5:20] <VurtualRuler98> Caffeine resistance may just be your body being hardcore doom mariney, and resistant to adrenaline.
[5:20] <Visiiri> Alpha: You liar, that doesn't come until level 17
[5:21] <VurtualRuler98> let's hope you learned from FPSes

[5:24] <Blubex> that you milk for ink

[5:25] <Chezhead> I need to find out how to use magic, anyone?
[5:25] <DragoonEnRegalia> And the next day there was St. Helen.
[5:25] <LanternGhost> There should be volcanos
[5:25] <Eagle> Magic isn't real, numbnuts
[5:25] <Visiiri> Chezhead: Press number 0
[5:26] <Eagle> what
[5:26] <Eagle> seriously?

[5:26] <DragoonEnRegalia> Doesn't matter. We want magic.
[5:26] <LanternGhost> And the volcanos should erupt
[5:26] <Alpha> For the good spells anyway
[5:26] <UnknownX> I shoved a creeper into the volcano and it erupted
[5:26] <Visiiri> Alpha is right, you do need a staff to enchant
[5:26] <DragoonEnRegalia> They will destroy cities!
[5:26] <Visiiri> It's just stick, stick, stick in a line vertical
[5:26] <DragoonEnRegalia> Triple-stick?

[5:26] <Visiiri> This volcano is no good to settle near
[5:26] <LanternGhost> we got some nice fish here
[5:26] <UnknownX> I jumped into a lake and it stoned over!
[5:26] <Alpha> Or stick stick iron/diamond/coal/stone
[5:26] <LanternGhost> I just built a nice fishing rod
[5:26] <Visiiri> Maybe we will find something better south, towards the forest.
[5:26] <Steel> creepers blow

[6:00] <ClassiestMedic> Iit's down?
[6:00] <Snake> Such a terrible trick, Vis.
[6:00] <boris> Has Notch ever considered the idea of making a "Hunger" meter?
[6:00] <ClassiestMedic> D:
[6:00] <Visiiri> Snake: .jsp has file stuff
[6:00] <redk95> :( :( :(
[6:00] <Snake> I'm disappointed.
[6:00] <Alpha> Hunger meter is alright, I guess
[6:00] <Visiiri> Snake, do you realize that a jsp COULD do that?
[6:00] <Chezhead> Snake's just jelous he didn't get into teh beta XD
[6:00] <JxTom> nose candy and floor polish >_>
[6:00] <ClassiestMedic> Wel vis sent me some vids
[6:00] <Azathoth> boris, i know everyone and their dog has suggested it
[6:00] <ClassiestMedic> it is epic
[6:00] <Snake> Yes, because you're going to play Minecraft without Java.
[6:00] <ClassiestMedic> There's chat and everything
[6:00] <Azathoth> don't know if !ch has considered it
[6:01] <Rakutenshi> minecraft as a jawa?

[6:01] <Visiiri> LET ME HAVE MY FUN
[6:01] <SpaceManiac> "JSP" is a server language
[6:01] <Visiiri> YOU JERKS D:
[6:01] <SpaceManiac> Like PHP
[6:01] <KodaichiZero> was JUST about to craft a pair of wings, too.
[6:01] <Snake> TOO BAD
[6:01] <Alpha> Medic, what's your mineID, I think the server's back
[6:01] <boris> I think the Hunger meter would be pretty integral. I mean anyone can build a sky fort and evade zombies if they never have to eat. If you have to eat youd have to build your base to work with nature so you can get at the pigs to satisfy your hunger or maintain a farm.
[6:01] <SpaceManiac> Or ASP
[6:01] <redk95> Visiiri what are you talking about?
[6:01] <ClassiestMedic> e_e
[6:01] <Snake> Some terrible joke
[6:01] <Visiiri> redk95, I have lied to you

[6:32] <DragoonEnRegalia> Yes.
[6:32] <Rook98_> Cool.
[6:33] <DragoonEnRegalia> And yet...
[6:33] <JxTom> we dont
[6:33] <underd0g> Finally, nbs-irc seems to be working
[6:33] <Nova> So lets talk about how Minecraft should have an option for 'minimal hud' -- no crosshair ec.
[6:33] <DragoonEnRegalia> We do not appear to be talking about Minecraft.
[6:33] <Nova> perhaps a feature to remove the action bar or have it minimize when not in use.
[6:33] <DragoonEnRegalia> Yes. It will allow for better machinima.

[6:33] <DragoonEnRegalia> 'nuff said?
[6:33] <Rook98_> I heard Notch is going to let some people from IRC play the multiplayer earlier so I thought I would get on more.
[6:33] <BurnedKirby> same here. guilty of that as well.

[6:34] <LuciferZ> Precisely for it's minimalism
[6:34] <Rook98_> Cool
[6:34] * Koko|L4D is now known as Kokopure
[6:34] <Nova> Minimal UI would help.
[6:35] <DragoonEnRegalia> I would love to get the Mineshow machinima by Animator and Iguana back and running.
[6:35] <Rook98_> I found out that all the crosshair does is invert colors so if you want good screenshots you can take them and then jsut invert the colors of the crosshair
[6:35] <Rook98_> And it will get rid of the crosshair
[6:35] <DragoonEnRegalia> But Animator is busy, and so is Iguana.
[6:35] <Nova> You can remove the crosshair completely, I believe.
[6:35] <Rook98_> Yeah
[6:35] <Nova> By replacing a hud file. It is a .png I believe.
[6:35] <DragoonEnRegalia> Yes, use a skin mod.

[6:40] <Annihilator> let's stop mentioning it ok
[6:40] <LuciferZ> A lot are from /v/ but certainly not the majority
[6:40] <Annihilator> nor talk about talking about it
[6:40] <Rook98_> I'm not sure what there is to talk about minecraft.
[6:40] <Eagle> Don't even talk about that
[6:40] <Cial> its better you dont

[6:40] <Rook98_> Yeah!
[6:40] <Annihilator> mp survival coming out on april 31st
[6:40] <Eagle> It's okay.
[6:40] <LuciferZ> rook98_: I placed some blocks today
[6:40] <Nova> A fruitless effort at minecraft related conversation, Dragoon.
[6:40] <Rook98_> I sure did

[6:40] <Eagle> It's kind of meh

[6:42] <Eagle> annihilator
[6:42] <Alpha> I got the guy next to him with a grapple spear.
[6:42] <Rook98_> Notch should add volcanos.
[6:42] <Rook98_> That would be epic
[6:42] <LuciferZ> I punched three pigs into lava, went around a corner, and found eight diamond ore.
[6:42] * Ezekeil (Mibbit@c-71-227-140-179.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
[6:42] <LuciferZ> Armok be praised.
[6:42] <Rook98_> Somone could break a hole in the volcano and kill a village.
[6:42] <Annihilator> what eagle
[6:42] <Eagle> what
[6:42] <Zelitor> lava flooding in an inf map would be fun! :D
[6:42] <Annihilator> what
[6:42] <Rook98_> :D
[6:42] <Eagle> what
[6:42] <Zelitor> oh wait
[6:42] <Annihilator> yeah what
[6:43] <Rook98_> It would be finite
[6:43] <Eagle> yeah
[6:43] <Rook98_> So that would be good.
[6:43] <Alpha> They would have to outrun the lava flow.
[6:43] <Annihilator> huh
[6:43] <Annihilator> okay then
[6:43] <Eagle> what
[6:43] <Rook98_> Indeed
[6:43] <Rook98_> Wouldn't be to hard though.
[6:43] <Rook98_> Lava is slow after all.

[6:43] <Zaneo> since notches announcement
[6:43] <Annihilator> remember when it started
[6:43] <Rook98_> Notch is going to implement buckets for liquid transportation
[6:43] <Azathoth> notch's
[6:43] <KodaichiZero> yeah.
[6:43] <Zaneo> notch's
[6:43] <Annihilator> there were roughly 90 of us
[6:43] <Azathoth> :D
[6:44] <BurnedKirby> yep...
[6:44] <Eagle> the very second that notch said "I WILL BE INVITING SOME PEOPLE FROM IRC TO THE MINECRAFT MULTIPLAYER BETA"
[6:44] <Eagle> etc
[6:44] <Zaneo> i was lazy and typing with one hand
[6:44] <Rook98_> Maybe we can put fires out with the water in the buckets
[6:44] <Annihilator> now it's twice that amount
[6:44] <BurnedKirby> and now there are many lurkers.
[6:44] <Konogan> Yup :P
[6:44] <Eagle> Annihilator, it was better
[6:44] <Eagle> when
[6:44] <KodaichiZero> who here has been on the IRC before today?
[6:44] <Eagle> there were only like 30 of us
[6:44] <KodaichiZero> :)
[6:44] <Rook98_> Sadly I don't live where Notch lives so when he comes on I might be at school or something.
[6:44] <Azathoth> notch should take bribes for beta access
[6:44] <Zaneo> I was thinking if you used 10 iron a bucket of water and sand you could have a fire extinguisher
[6:44] <Azathoth> oh wait. preorders >_>
[6:44] <Annihilator> Eagle: you mean mcchatter
[6:44] <Zaneo> kind of like sodium bicarbonate
[6:44] <Rook98_> Bribes?
[6:44] <Eagle> god no
[6:44] <Rook98_> What kind of Bribes?
[6:44] <Eagle> that place is just depressing
[6:44] <Annihilator> it's so damn quiet in there haha
[6:45] <Annihilator> remember drama?
[6:45] <Vladivostok> How much would you pay Notch to get beta access
[6:45] <LuciferZ> Does anyone have any cool indev maps?
[6:45] <Eagle> I think?
[6:45] <Rook98_> Nothing
[6:45] <Eagle> wait

[6:45] <VurtualRuler98> I wonder if I could get hard enough abs that I could knock out people by smacking their head into said abs.
[6:46] <Eagle> Malikat
[6:46] <Eagle> what have you done
[6:46] <Azathoth> you could knock someone out by smashing their head into anything if you use enough force
[6:46] <Eagle> oh god

[6:52] <Zaneo> a piece of tnt in a staircase behind glass
[6:52] <VurtualRuler98> creepers with their feet rotated 90 degrees
[6:52] <VurtualRuler98> made much larger
[6:52] <LanternGhost> I miss anything

[6:52] <VurtualRuler98> the first one
[6:52] <Azathoth> like i want to pop a cap in some goblins with a glock

[6:53] <Zaneo> Tree houses are fun OMGitznoob
[6:53] <VurtualRuler98> you can do that
[6:53] <VurtualRuler98> Port the game to quake 2, and use even more weapons.
[6:53] <Malikat> 100% true.

[6:53] <Malikat> the only way i could prove you wrong is by actually giving you an invite, and that would be countering the rules set forth in the topic
[6:53] <Rook98_> I mean you put the answers up after the questions. It just seems to easy, even though the answers you put may be wrong.
[6:53] <Zaneo> I had a break in case of emergency button it was all cool Eagle

[7:01] <OMGitznoob> Kinda hard to say
[7:01] <Azathoth> inf-dev?
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> That doesn't break, and can be obtained easily.
[7:01] <The_Lurker> infdev...
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> Well, doesn't break easily.
[7:01] <Zaneo> in-f-dev
[7:01] <Azathoth> not that hard
[7:01] <OMGitznoob> I call it infinite dev
[7:01] <Azathoth> you can't say inf?
[7:01] <The_Lurker> phonetically
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> "You have the legendary Excalibur! The ultimate sword!"
[7:01] <VurtualRuler98> And then it's just an iron sword with a bit more health.
[7:01] <Naxza> Azathoth- I've been using this computer and this version of Vista for over three years.
[7:01] <OMGitznoob> Those 2 words kinda mesh together

[7:05] <Annihilator> it's a dlc
[7:05] <Vis{L4D2}> Annihilator: Orly

[7:05] <Annihilator> and some new things
[7:05] <OMGitznoob> The Passing is for L4d2?
[7:06] <Naxza> I love L4D2, I hate DLC.
[7:06] <Visiiri> I was hoping they'd add more concrete modes
[7:06] <The_Lurker> isn't this meant to be about minecraft :S
[7:06] <VurtualRuler98> I hate l4d2
[7:06] <Azathoth> becuase microsoft won't allow free DLC
[7:06] <Annihilator> but do you hate free dlcs?!
[7:06] <OMGitznoob> You should only play Valve games on PC
[7:06] <Naxza> DLC just complicates things.
[7:06] <UnknownX> Its a different type of gamemode every day
[7:06] <OMGitznoob> Srsly its a rule
[7:06] <Visiiri> UnknownX: Every week?
[7:06] <VurtualRuler98> Valve's "DLC" that's really "moar free content yay" is cool though
[7:06] <Azathoth> you should only play FPSes on PC :P
[7:06] <Zaneo> what do you mean who was missing on my poster Visiiri?
[7:06] <UnknownX> Maybe week
[7:06] <Naxza> 'Cuz it's not free for everyone, or it's not free at all, or it's a feature that should have been with the game, etc.
[7:06] <Annihilator> unless you're on the xbox
[7:06] <UnknownX> Idk
[7:06] <Annihilator> in which microsoft forces you to pay
[7:06] <OMGitznoob> FPS on the PC allow you to jump and shoot At the same time
[7:06] <Visiiri> Zaneo: Read a recent news post
[7:06] <Visiiri> They've fixed the poster: One survivor is missing
[7:07] <Visiiri> It's different for most people.
[7:07] <Annihilator> what
[7:07] <The_Lurker> pc owns consoles for fps
[7:07] <Visiiri> And Rochelle's AK no longer vanishes behind her head.
[7:07] <UnknownX> Its going to be Bill
[7:07] <Zaneo> Ah
[7:07] <Visiiri> Nah, Zoey
[7:07] <VirtualFox> The having to pay for the Xbox DLC is coz the publisher (In this case, Microsoft, requires a payment to host the DLC files on their servers)
[7:07] <Zaneo> I haven't checked yet
[7:07] <UnknownX> Zoey was in one of the pictures
[7:07] <Annihilator> or could it be random...?!
[7:07] <Visiiri> UnknownX: Not mine.
[7:07] <OMGitznoob> Lets say that the server hosting of a game company is the amusement park Microsoft is the ticket booth infront of the the amusement park ticket booth
[7:07] <Annihilator> that would be an interesting outcome
[7:07] <Zaneo> I can't be bothered to start l4d2

[7:22] <The_Lurker> lol, yeah
[7:22] <LanternGhost> Questions? Comments?
[7:22] <LuciferZ> Lol, suckers.
[7:22] <Subhazard> It's a good thing I stayed home today.
[7:22] <LanternGhost> Good thing you won't be invited today :D
[7:22] <Subhazard> I love testing for bugs.
[7:22] <Subhazard> LuciferZ, you know you and me will be a shoe in.
[7:22] <LanternGhost> He might not have even started working on it
[7:23] <LanternGhost> I mean he just announced today that he will start working on it
[7:23] <Exeel> i am good at finding bugs
[7:23] <The_Lurker> he will soon though
[7:23] <LanternGhost> but it might take a while to get start
[7:23] <Corvak> Psh, I dont have the time right now anyway, I just idle in this chat a lot
[7:23] <Subhazard> I'd be willing to give Notch 5 bux to let me help.
[7:23] <The_Lurker> i eat bugs
[7:23] <Exeel> always found them when i played close beta games
[7:23] <Naxza> Timezones suck between myself and when Notch probably gets online. Someone put a good word in for me?
[7:23] <LanternGhost> I am just going to be lurking in here like the fist of the northern star!

[7:24] <Subhazard> I nfact, I think I'm might pay him 5 bucks to let me help him with new versions, as far as testing goes. I have a mid-low end computer with an intel graphics card (one of the most finicky, annoying graphics cards on the market)

[7:24] <Subhazard> is pretty scary

[7:37] <Subhazard> There are no mods for Deus Ex 2? What?
[7:38] <Azathoth> probably because people didn't really like it

[7:38] <Subhazard> It was.. okay.
[7:38] <Subhazard> But still
[7:38] <Lantern_Ghost> I got kicked :9
[7:38] <Azathoth> didn't really stack up to the first game, but it was still fun

[8:35] <Phil> bee hives would make trees a lot more scary to chop down
[8:35] <VurtualRuler98> beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees.
[8:36] <VurtualRuler98> Bees with lasers.
[8:36] <VurtualRuler98> Armed with a little capacitor-laser.
[8:36] <VurtualRuler98> So they can fire like 1-2 shots, which each individually recahrge.
[8:36] <VurtualRuler98> Each dealing a heart of damage.
[8:37] <Malikat> what
[8:37] <Malikat> bees with lasers
[8:37] <VurtualRuler98> So, a player not prepared for a swarm will take blasts of bee-lasers, taking health of
[8:37] <Malikat> i am both astonished and astounded
[8:37] <Yourself> it'd be cool if trees actually fell down
[8:37] <Phil> yes
[8:37] <Phil> I agree
[8:37] <Yourself> you'd still have to chop them up, but with the new trees you'll have to build a platform to reach the top branches
[8:37] <VurtualRuler98> Then, once the bees are formed up for a second assault, many unleash their lasers, capible of taking out a chunk of armor, and 5 health.
[8:38] <Phil> k no
[8:39] <VurtualRuler98> Then the bees will lose formation and try not to be group-killed until their first charge is ready again, where they will use it to give themselves covering fire as they form into a firing line again.
[8:39] <Yourself> that was me explaining why it kind of sucks that they don't fall
[8:39] <Malikat> dude
[8:40] <Yourself> the new trees are quite tall
[8:40] <Maniac> Trees should act like sand once seperated from the ground, just flop down to the dround
[8:40] <Malikat> that sounds like bees as a metroid prime boss fight
[8:40] <VurtualRuler98> hmm
[8:40] <Maniac> ground*
[8:40] <Yourself> BEES
[8:40] <VurtualRuler98> You're right.
[8:40] <VurtualRuler98> I was thinking more like old shooter enemeis.
[8:40] <Phil> enemas?
[8:40] <VurtualRuler98> enemys.
[8:40] <Malikat> trees can't fall because that would require dynamic blocks
[8:40] <Malikat> and notch doesn't want dynamic blocks.
[8:40] <VurtualRuler98> Players will be forced to either try to smack every bee down with a melee weapon individually, then running over them dangerously/smacking them again, or using fire/explosives.
[8:41] <Phil> or just run away or get underwater
[8:41] <Salads> would be cool to turn bars of silver and gold into coins when for multiplayer comes out
[8:41] <Phil> who tries to kill bees with a sword?
[8:41] <Phil> thats not gonna happen
[8:41] <VurtualRuler98> amphibious bees with little dive suits built into their laser.
[8:41] <VurtualRuler98> which is like a laser pointer
[8:41] <VurtualRuler98> That can fight in the water, or jump out and try to snipe you if you're going over a land bridge.
[8:42] <Phil> kay
[8:42] <Yourself> <Malikat> trees can't fall because that would require dynamic blocks
[8:42] <VurtualRuler98> Upon cutting a supporting chunk out of a leaf/log structure, the tree is rotated by 90 degrees into the angle of removal?
[8:42] <Yourself> yeah, it's a damn shame

[8:44] <VurtualRuler98> doing extra damage infront, but half normal sword damage from behind
[8:44] <Phil> the friction of boots on grass
[8:45] <Bolo> I know
[8:45] <Bolo> it only works with wooden swords that you combined with a torch in some way
[8:45] <Phil> btw whats up with the combat system.... its so basic its kinda lame if oyu ask me
[8:45] <Phil> not trying to be a whiner though
[8:45] <VurtualRuler98> click on things to kill them
[8:45] <VurtualRuler98> That's railgun science
[8:45] <Vicrry> Better idea: make a nuke to nuke it from orbit. Twice. To be extra sure.
[8:45] <Bolo> Got beef?
[8:45] <Phil> i wish it would actually swing the sword, and attack anything it touches
[8:45] <Malikat> extra sure.
[8:45] <Malikat> SURE?
[8:45] <Malikat> NOT SURE.
[8:45] <Malikat> oh man
[8:45] <Vicrry> :)
[8:46] <Malikat> i want to do a side by side of that
[8:46] <Malikat> of like, conventional bombing
[8:46] <Malikat> and then i picture of hiroshima
[8:46] <Malikat> SURE / NOT SURE
[8:46] <Malikat> and the subtitle
[8:46] <Malikat> nuke the from orbit: it's the only way to be sure
[8:47] <VurtualRuler98> Maybe minecraft could have an actual railgun!
[8:47] <VurtualRuler98> That fires swords as ammo.
[8:47] <Bolo> Is it bad i found that HILARIOUS
[8:47] <VurtualRuler98> It'd be like a crossbow-slingshot.
[8:47] <Qizi> like a balista then
[8:47] <Lantern_Ghost> Hey
[8:47] <VurtualRuler98> that fires swords and you carry it around
[8:48] <Lantern_Ghost> So how did you guys like the multiplayer survival test?
[8:48] <Phil> so.... why did i come in here again?
[8:48] <Lantern_Ghost> Everyone enjoy it?
[8:48] <VurtualRuler98> really fast supersonic swords that make a loud cracking slicey noise
[8:48] <Malikat> there has been no multiplayer survival test
[8:48] <Malikat> are you trolling, Lantern_Ghost
[8:48] <Qizi> multiplayer survival test?
[8:48] <VurtualRuler98> Firing swords, dealing super-sword-damage, but breaking a huge amount on impact with a wall.
[8:48] <VurtualRuler98> Lantern_Ghost, too buggy.
[8:48] <VurtualRuler98> p2p prediction was horribly done
[8:48] <Yourself> nuking from orbit is too expensive

[8:48] <VurtualRuler98> Yourself, take an icbm and then fire it out of a space shuttle.
[8:49] <VurtualRuler98> Or just fire it up a bit more, then down.
[8:49] <Malikat> do you know how big ICBMs are
[8:49] <VurtualRuler98> We will make a shuttle big enough.
[8:49] <Yourself> yes, and i know they're sub-orbital vehicles
[8:49] <VurtualRuler98> So it'll be like the intro of quake 2, instead of drop pods it'll be ICBMs.
[8:49] <Bolo> I'm guessing the acronym is Inter continental ballistic missile?
[8:49] <VurtualRuler98> So we just nuke everything instantly.
[8:50] <VurtualRuler98> no, internet chat beeeeees message, bolo, obviously.

[8:54] <bildramer> 170 people are here, many are willing to discuss from time to time
[8:54] <VurtualRuler98> Also, as a boss-type mob for minecraft, maybe some kind of alien beast that guards a system of large meteor-ships.
[8:54] <Bolo> but they arent
[8:54] <bildramer> indeed
[8:54] <bildramer> over 90% lurkers

[8:57] <VurtualRuler98> Random scattered materials would exist in this lightly-constructed area, and you could loot it for cheap metals.

[8:59] <bildramer> I wonder if MP is out in less than 2 weeks
[8:59] <Cial> and you stayed because we locked the door Forevener
[8:59] <VurtualRuler98> Everybody always wants asteroids of materials, and dungeons and extra metals and bosses and such.

[9:17] <Yourself> well you could design a ctcp to do that

[10:34] <Speljohan_> one of my music cd's was identified as the original game disc

[10:48] <vurtual> Beyond things like "jump at red armor like this", and games of varying genres that required co-ordination.
[10:48] <Speljohan_> i only play strategy games for the multiplayer
[10:48] <vurtual> Except maybe the occasional times I played CIV IV or wesnoth, or tried to play a ta spring mod, and got distracted and left.
[10:49] <Speljohan_> tbh i've spent most my time playing indie games
[10:49] <Speljohan_> indie platformers etc
[10:49] <vurtual> Even then that's about as strategic as "make cities", or "spam teh orc warriors", or "FLUSH FLUSH GO GO GO"
[10:49] <vurtual> Seriously, it's such a powerful tactic, that nobody does it, as the game would just be way too boring.
[10:49] <Speljohan_> all depends on the game and the players vurtual
[10:50] <vurtual> flash rushing
[10:50] <Speljohan_> for instance, playing aoe2 online is ridiculously hard
[10:50] <Speljohan_> because all hardcore nerds from release still play
[10:50] <vurtual> It's so effective that it's like having a quad damage bfg with no self-splash and full auto infinite ammo
[10:50] <Speljohan_> kinda the same thing that happened to quake 1
[10:50] <vurtual> Infact it pretty much is like that
[10:50] <vurtual> So those players who are best off doing things like that, don't do it at all, and then suck when they're trampled by the good CORE players.
[10:51] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:51] <Speljohan_> yeah, TA isn't the most balanced game
[10:51] <vurtual> ta spring, balanced annihilation, could be
[10:51] <Speljohan_> i still enjoy it from time to time tho
[10:51] * Titans is now known as register
[10:51] <Speljohan_> what i really didnt like was supcom2
[10:51] <vurtual> If we just got off our butts and tried to throw all we've got
[10:51] * register is now known as Rirans
[10:52] <Speljohan_> now there's a title that sucks
[10:52] <vurtual> I liked supcom 2
[10:52] * Rirans is now known as Titans
[10:52] <vurtual> it wasn't like, strategic or thinky or challenging
[10:52] <Speljohan_> they ruined the resource gathering
[10:52] <Speljohan_> :/
[10:52] <vurtual> But it was like, doing nothing, except more entertaining.
[10:52] <vurtual> "Oh no, I might lose my xyz outpost again, then I'll have less outpost things!"
[10:52] <vurtual> On the sky platform demo mission I just ended up building random experimentals for the lulz.
[10:52] <Speljohan_> sounds like you have never played vs good people before vurtual lol
[10:53] <vurtual> supcom 2
[10:53] <vurtual> demo.
[10:53] <vurtual> Pretty sure it doesn't have mp even
[10:53] <Speljohan_> i mean any rts
[10:53] <Speljohan_> etc
[10:53] <vurtual> I play online in spring mods.
[10:53] <Speljohan_> i havent played spring online so i dunno about that
[10:53] <vurtual> I either am against a horrible player who cannot play at all
[10:54] <Speljohan_> buut, in games like aoe it is mad hard online
[10:54] <vurtual> or the people who are so good, they do the more unspoken CORE tactics that allow you to just build hundreds of experimentals
[10:54] <Speljohan_> mostly cus theres so many strategies
[10:54] <vurtual> and then make the enemy lose because they cannot actually physically use any of the land
[10:54] <vurtual> because big things are in the way
[10:54] <Speljohan_> lool
[10:54] <vurtual> Then you capture a krogoth and begin annihilating the other weaker ones.
[10:54] <vurtual> Then they shoot you.
[10:55] <Speljohan_> lol, we generally disable experimentals when we play original TA
[10:55] <vurtual> no seriously, why are these the same soooong
[10:55] <vurtual> They're like, a decade apart potentially.

[10:56] <vurtual> INFACT
[10:56] <vurtual> You could basically pass off half-life as a game before quake 2.

[10:58] <Speljohan_> they are taken from real bands though vurtual
[10:58] <Speljohan_> that's what the vid shows
[10:58] <vurtual> yeah
[10:59] <vurtual> Listen to track19 of quake 2, and Disrupted Original from half-life 2
[10:59] <Speljohan_> and imo they did an awesome job

[10:59] <ThePizzaDoctor> :coolface: anyway
[10:59] <vurtual> quake 2/half-life 2
[11:00] <Speljohan_> what really surprised me
[11:00] <Speljohan_> was how they fuckin included atheist in their soundtrack
[11:00] <vurtual> also I want to see when these songs were made
[11:00] <Speljohan_> an obscure jazz fusion death metal band
[11:00] <vurtual> since doom has that e1m1 sound in them all
[11:00] <Speljohan_> which pretty much nobody has heard of

[11:03] <Speljohan_> is good
[11:03] <ThePizzaDoctor> speed metal
[11:03] <ThePizzaDoctor> pirate metal

[11:21] <ThePizzaDoctor> starting pig farms
[11:21] <Lizzrd> and then just make an escape tunnel
[11:21] <vurtual> I think I've gone nutty guys.
[11:21] <ThePizzaDoctor> using pig shields
[11:22] <Lizzrd> i wonder when notch will add meat armor craftable from cooked meat...
[11:22] <ThePizzaDoctor> that sounds awesome
[11:22] <Lizzrd> when you're hurt
[11:22] <ThePizzaDoctor> it should attract spiders and zombies
[11:22] <Lizzrd> you just take a bite of your shoulder

[11:23] <Chibiace> awesome, I just steel next to my base...but it's not coal D:
[11:23] <ThePizzaDoctor> why do zombies have feathers?
[11:23] <vurtual> meat armor
[11:23] <Lizzrd> they believe they can fly
[11:23] <vurtual> >minestrogg
[11:23] <Subhazard> So I'm playing Deus Ex Invisible War
[11:23] <vurtual> uncraft your legs and re-craft some new metal ones
[11:23] <Subhazard> That game go to much bad rap that it didn't deserve.
[11:23] <godhand1942> hmmm meat armor.....lol wouldnt meat armor just spoil
[11:23] <vurtual> brb reinstalling
[11:23] <Subhazard> It certainly didn't stand up to the first, but it's not a bad game.
[11:23] <vurtual> wear stone armor in nethack
[11:23] <vurtual> stone-to-flesh
[11:23] <Lizzrd> nah it would stay good
[11:23] <Subhazard> Hell, it's not even a mediocre game, I'd say it's pretty good
[11:24] <Lizzrd> like all meat in minecrft
[11:24] <Lizzrd> hell
[11:24] <Subhazard> It's just not GROUNDBREAKING
[11:24] <Lizzrd> i have a doublechest full of meat
[11:24] <Lizzrd> been there for some infdev days
[11:24] <godhand1942> sub its just that deus ex the original one was way better
[11:24] <godhand1942> by far better
[11:24] <Subhazard> Oh i know
[11:24] <Subhazard> I'm getting a deus ex tattoo for fucks sake
[11:25] <Speljohan_> loll
[11:25] <Lizzrd> lol
[11:25] <godhand1942> and usually sequals are supposed to be better
[11:25] <Evil-Ville> what's wrong with you
[11:25] <Subhazard> I'm serious.
[11:25] <Subhazard> I am absolutely serious.

[11:25] <Speljohan_> i'm getting that on my arm
[11:25] <Subhazard> And it's so much more than that, actually, Deus Ex helped me pick a CAREER
[11:25] <Speljohan_> people are going to be "WTF????"
[11:25] <Evil-Ville> you should get it done with poisonous ink then
[11:25] <Subhazard> Why is that Evil.
[11:25] <Subhazard> Oh, and you shouldn't get tattoos just to fuck with people.
[11:26] <Subhazard> That'll wear off, the effect, and your amusement from it
[11:26] <Subhazard> And then in the end, you'll have a stupid fucking tattoo

[11:26] <Speljohan_> made it last year
[11:26] <vurtual> get neurotattoos
[11:26] <vurtual> that you control with your mind
[11:26] <Subhazard> But Evil
[11:26] <Lizzrd> :P
[11:26] <vurtual> flex biceps, gain new imagined tattoo
[11:26] <Subhazard> I'd like to know the origin of your distaste for my idea.
[11:26] <Subhazard> I can understand the general implications - how silly it is to get a tattoo of a hobby.
[11:27] <Evil-Ville> it's a video game tattoo
[11:27] <Evil-Ville> it's the worst kind of tattoo
[11:27] <Speljohan_> not more strange than my tattoo
[11:27] <Speljohan_> which is from a band
[11:27] <Subhazard> However, Deus Ex affected me more than any form of media I've come across.
[11:27] <Evil-Ville> then there's something wrong with you
[11:27] <Lizzrd> i would say that brand tatoos are the worst, really
[11:27] <Subhazard> And why is that.

[11:28] <Subhazard> See? I'll make it.
[11:28] <Speljohan_> we get warp drive capability in 2061
[11:28] <Lizzrd> KILLER BEES! (Now also in nano scale!)
[11:28] <Subhazard> Besides, we're reaching a crescendo point in human acheivement.
[11:28] <Speljohan_> and nanotechnology won't come until after that
[11:29] <Chibiace> BEES EVERYWHERE!
[11:29] <Subhazard> Speljohan, we already HAVE nanotechnology.
[11:29] <Speljohan_> cannot change history etc
[11:29] <Lizzrd> people in the future will be all like
[11:29] <Speljohan_> i mean real pro nanotechnology Subhazard
[11:29] <Lizzrd> "AUGH NO NOT THE BEES NOOO!"
[11:29] <Speljohan_> like borg nanoprobes
[11:29] <Subhazard> I probably shouldn't have come here for a discussion regarding high-science.
[11:29] <Speljohan_> nope.
[11:29] <Subhazard> It's kind of like going to a Seattle coffee shop to discuss death metal.
[11:29] <Evil-Ville> well there's simple nanorobots already
[11:30] <Lizzrd> sounds interesting
[11:30] <Speljohan_> actually that should work Subhazard
[11:30] <Speljohan_> seattle has had sum big death metal bands...
[11:30] <Speljohan_> loll
[11:30] <Subhazard> Evil, I'm really interested in the silicon cells that deliver a dose of cancer fighting agent to a specific area.
[11:30] <Subhazard> They respond to a chemical injected at the tumor site which causes the cells to open and deliver the dosage.
[11:30] <Lizzrd> Yeah those are great
[11:30] <Lizzrd> if you have cancer that is
[11:31] <Speljohan_> i don't believe in curing cancer tho
[11:31] <Subhazard> My uncle is getting the treatment done, he's going to be one of the first.
[11:31] <Speljohan_> !
[11:31] <Speljohan_> i am too sceptical to our progress for that
[11:31] <Subhazard> He was going to get his voicebox taken out.
[11:31] <Lizzrd> voice boxes are for sissies
[11:31] <Subhazard> My grandfather -- his father, died from cancer because of a lack of medical insurance.
[11:31] <Speljohan_> what we do need is another war
[11:31] <Lizzrd> real men use microsoft sam
[11:31] <Speljohan_> to exterminate more people
[11:31] <Subhazard> My grandma faced it, my dad faced it, now it's my uncles turn, and I'm sure I'm probably next.

[11:32] <Subhazard> If he could have only waited a few years, he would've had it.
[11:32] <Evil-Ville> no it's probably a war where US kills more brown people

[11:35] <Speljohan_> for technological progression
[11:35] <Evil-Ville> and earth isn't even close to being overpopulated
[11:35] <Lizzrd> yes it is
[11:35] <Evil-Ville> nope you don't know what you're talking about
[11:35] <Lizzrd> hence 2012 we will have too many peoople so that noone gets to see a movie in theater
[11:35] <Lizzrd> :3
[11:36] <Speljohan_> loll
[11:36] <Speljohan_> ps 2012 was the worst movie evar
[11:36] <Lizzrd> soon anyway if people keep on truckin
[11:36] <Griskard> Evil is right
[11:36] <Subhazard> Evil is telling the truth.
[11:36] <Griskard> The earth is nofuckingwherenear overpopulated
[11:36] <Lizzrd> we do have too many people here though
[11:36] <Subhazard> You could fit the entire population of earth, in texas.
[11:36] <Lizzrd> not overpopulated
[11:36] <Griskard> Maybe in your world (Two or three blocks?) it is
[11:36] <Subhazard> Comfortably.
[11:36] <Lizzrd> but a bit too many
[11:37] <Griskard> Sub is also right
[11:37] <Lizzrd> no you couldn't
[11:37] <Lizzrd> cause texas sin't that nice of a place
[11:37] <Griskard> Every person who has ever been born could fit into texas with an acre block each
[11:37] <Subhazard> Lizzrd, you don't know what overpopulated means until you go to Mexico City, or Tokyo.
[11:37] <Lizzrd> i know how it is there :P
[11:37] <Subhazard> You aren't thinking in correct terms Lizzrd.
[11:37] <Subhazard> It's about the numbers.
[11:37] <Lizzrd> no it isn't
[11:37] <Subhazard> Not 'how nice of a place it is'
[11:37] <Lizzrd> it's about how many rednecks you can cram into a wagon
[11:37] <Subhazard> Fitting people comfortably in one space, all people, would be about the size of texas.
[11:38] <Speljohan_> it's overpopulated in the sense that we can't sustain our current standards of living for a very long time
[11:38] <BearClaw89> nothing at all?
[11:38] <Lizzrd> comfortabely means having it comfortable
[11:38] <Griskard> Actually, 1 acre is alot more than just comfortable
[11:38] <Lizzrd> not that you sleep in your bathroom
[11:38] <Subhazard> Lizzrd, have you ever had a purely logical thought without falling back to humour as a defense mechanism for your own mental inadequacy?
[11:38] <Griskard> Considering most houses are on like, 1/10th of an acre
[11:38] <Lizzrd> yes
[11:38] <Lizzrd> and it was boring as hell
[11:38] <Lizzrd> no i'm an artist
[11:38] <Lizzrd> but yeah would be cool to see the whole earth living in texas really
[11:38] <Lizzrd> just
[11:39] <Speljohan_> i wouldn't
[11:39] <Lizzrd> huuge buildings there and just outside
[11:39] <Lizzrd> nothing
[11:39] <Speljohan_> anywhere but america

[11:40] <Lizzrd> but yeah if you had the whole of mankind in texas you have the problem of terrorism
[11:40] <Lizzrd> or same area
[11:40] <Lizzrd> :V
[11:40] <Subhazard> For a comfortably population density, that 'space' is best represented by 'texas'
[11:41] <Speljohan_> i dislike the term terrorism thesedays
[11:41] <Subhazard> Me? Only tuesdays :3
[11:41] <Speljohan_> should be changed in dictionary
[11:41] <Lizzrd> terrorism is the fact that you aren't alone in this world
[11:41] <Speljohan_> "Terrorism - An excuse to declare wars aganist other countries for imperialistic reasons"

[11:41] <Subhazard> Lizzrd, explain that sentence.
[11:41] <Subhazard> Because it doesn't make any sense.
[11:42] <Subhazard> 'Terrorism is the anti-loneliness?'
[11:42] <Lizzrd> and conspiracy is that each and every one of them could send a nuke on you one day or another
[11:42] <Speljohan_> lol ye that is a classic Lizzrd
[11:42] <Lizzrd> they are hand in hand
[11:42] <Subhazard> Not neccesarily true. Plenty of cops carry weapons, doesn't mean they're all POTENTIALLY going to fire on you.
[11:42] <Lizzrd> more terrorism = more conspiracy
[11:43] <Subhazard> The statistical likelihood of a cop shooting you when you aren't doing anything wrong is negligible, if not minuscule.
[11:43] <Speljohan_> obv not Subhazard lol
[11:43] <Speljohan_> hell, in sweden not all cops carry guns
[11:43] <Lizzrd> if i had a gun
[11:43] <Subhazard> Fucking neighbors having a god damn dance party at MIDNIGHT
[11:43] <Lizzrd> and you had just killed another cop
[11:43] <Speljohan_> patrol cops have tazers instead
[11:43] <Subhazard> ON MY ROOF
[11:43] <Lizzrd> hell in norway noone does :P
[11:43] <Subhazard> Lizzrd, you don't get it.
[11:43] <Speljohan_> :P
[11:43] <Subhazard> The police thing is a metaphor. Do you know what a metaphor is?
[11:43] <Subhazard> It's an analogy rather.
[11:43] <Lizzrd> and we have mantally imbalanced cops
[11:44] <Subhazard> mentally*
[11:44] <Lizzrd> yes i know what a metaphor is
[11:44] <Speljohan_> Subhazard, i'm fairly certain Lizzrd was being sarcastic in his sentence though
[11:44] <Subhazard> It's not about cops, I was discussing 'probablities' and using cops as an example. The point of it is not to talk about all the problems of the police.
[11:44] <Lizzrd> me? sarcastic? noooo neeever
[11:45] <Subhazard> I argue to teach, not to be right (and to learn)
[11:45] <Lizzrd> you have conspiracy theorists for everything
[11:45] <Speljohan_> i argue for the sake of argument
[11:45] <Lizzrd> and you know
[11:45] <vurtual> wait wait
[11:45] <Subhazard> Just keep that in mind. I don't have you :P

[11:46] <Subhazard> The government could no more keep up a charade better than your average joe.
[11:46] <Speljohan_> some are more probable than others tho Subhazard
[11:46] <Speljohan_> :P
[11:46] <Lizzrd> no but that's where the aliens come in
[11:46] <Subhazard> There is no 'perfect storm' of conspiracy theories.
[11:46] <Subhazard> People are dumb, the truth always comes out.
[11:46] <Lizzrd> lol
[11:46] <Speljohan_> pretty much the truth
[11:46] <Lizzrd> not always
[11:46] <Lizzrd> like
[11:46] <Speljohan_> however, there are exceptions
[11:46] <Lizzrd> you know those templars?
[11:46] <Speljohan_> WWII
[11:46] <Speljohan_> the death camps
[11:47] <Speljohan_> they were kept secret pretty damn well
[11:47] <Lizzrd> they are secret cause they didn't invent the internet earlier
[11:47] <Subhazard> You want to know the most secretive organization in the world is?
[11:47] <Subhazard> The Russian Mob
[11:47] <Speljohan_> more like the EU
[11:47] <Speljohan_> lol
[11:47] <Lizzrd> who?
[11:47] <AndrewPH> exactly
[11:47] <Subhazard> They do things, and control things that you couldn't even possibly fathom or get your head around.
[11:47] <Speljohan_> sounds like EU to me!
[11:47] <Speljohan_> they must be collaborating!

[11:48] <Lizzrd> i just wish i didn't know this much though...

[11:48] <Subhazard> They've taken over Detroit, from the dirt up.

[11:49] <Lizzrd> are you sure you didn't come in here just to talk to me?
[11:49] <Subhazard> You can actually depend on the mob, whether it be Russian, Caldean, Italian, Albanian, whatever... to increase trade and business.
[11:49] <Lizzrd> true
[11:49] <Speljohan_> true

[11:49] <Speljohan_> kinda the same thing with hells angels in sweden Subhazard
[11:50] <Subhazard> Someone got word of a homeless kid with a brain.

[11:50] <Subhazard> And they offered to let me sleep in their pawnshop, and they would feed me, as long as I manned the shop and kept out intruders (specifically the mexican gang)
[11:50] <Lizzrd> lol
[11:50] <Speljohan_> sounds like a dangerous job Subhazard
[11:50] <Lizzrd> there's capitals to you
[11:50] <yoshibot> sounds like a pretty good deal if you're homeless
[11:50] <Subhazard> The pawn shop was really just a front for a small meeting place. A tax curtain really.
[11:50] <Subhazard> Nothing crazy.
[11:50] <Lizzrd> oslo is more of a crackhead
[11:50] <Speljohan_> lol oslo
[11:51] <Speljohan_> i was supposed to go there in january
[11:51] <Lizzrd> yeah i know
[11:51] <Subhazard> It wasn't that dangerous, except for that one occasion when some mexican started trying to pick the lock.
[11:51] <Speljohan_> but i was broke
[11:51] <Griskard> You know who the most awesome organisation in the world is?
[11:51] <Speljohan_> for a festival

[11:51] <Griskard> Lol Lizzrd. They sorta, raped the IDF
[11:51] <yoshibot> we are the largest channel on esper
[11:52] <Griskard> And the IDF usually are the rapists, not the rapees
[11:52] <Subhazard> No questions, I got paid, and I wouldn't have to get involved with anything.
[11:52] <Speljohan_> i'd not trust that in most cases tho Subhazard

[11:53] <AndrewPH> "AH AM BOWLO SANTOSHI"
[11:53] <Subhazard> He keeps track of everyone that they've done a favor for. Being that I'm still poor, and I'm not very intimidating, they won't ask for anything in return.
[11:53] <Griskard> -Car blows up-
[11:53] <Speljohan_> i've been involved with too much illegal business already

[12:04] <Lizzrd> :b
[12:04] <vurtual> then courage/wisdom go to quake 2 and 3
[12:04] <yoshibot> that's why there needs to be something else to do once you have a functioning economy
[12:04] <vurtual> there's supposedly a 4th thing to go in the hole but
[12:04] <Speljohan_> yeah yoshibot
[12:04] <Lizzrd> hence

[12:04] <vurtual> nobody really believes THAT now
[12:04] <Lizzrd> kill people
[12:04] <Speljohan_> this is where 999x games fail yoshibot
[12:04] <Speljohan_> every single mmo
[12:04] <Speljohan_> etc
[12:04] <Lizzrd> in minecraft
[12:04] <yoshibot> i had the idea of making a whole awesome tech tree eventually culminating at going into fucking SPACE.
[12:04] <Speljohan_> either it has no content or it is a grind
[12:04] <vurtual> Okay I'm kinda panic-y here
[12:04] <vurtual> ...I think the rad program is unable to find a colormap
[12:04] <yoshibot> ...and then you mine.
[12:04] <Lizzrd> ou can just build a fort then kill creepers n get enough tnt to blow your opponents to kingdom come
[12:05] <yoshibot> IN SPAAAAAAAAAAAAACE~
[12:05] <Lizzrd> :P
[12:05] <Speljohan_> space-race is a win idea yoshibot
[12:05] <Lizzrd> forgetting the skycap are we?

[12:05] <AriB> vote for the best =P
[12:05] <yoshibot> except Notch wants to keep it fantasy
[12:05] <Speljohan_> civilization and minecraft mixed yoshibot
[12:05] <Speljohan_> that's a fantastic idea
[12:05] <yoshibot> in fact
[12:05] <yoshibot> i had this whole crazy awesome minecraft/cave story/gg2/tribes 2 game engine idea
[12:05] <Lizzrd> i find that idea silly
[12:06] <vurtual> arghrad isn't finding a colormap guys what do I dooo

[12:06] <Griskard> Yoshi
[12:06] <Lizzrd> i got a great idea to fight your enemies
[12:06] <Speljohan_> except it's not persistant
[12:06] <Lizzrd> you like
[12:06] <Griskard> Wanna work on a tech tree/endgame sorta thing?
[12:06] <yoshibot> this wouldn't be persistent either
[12:06] <vurtual> okay rproblem found
[12:06] <Lizzrd> put loads of mobs in a hole
[12:07] <Speljohan_> endgame sucks!!!
[12:07] <Lizzrd> have a tunnel up in theo ther's fort
[12:07] <Griskard> YOU SUCK
[12:07] <Lizzrd> then RELEASE THE HOUNDS
[12:07] <Speljohan_> no mp game should have endgame
[12:07] <Speljohan_> !
[12:07] <Lizzrd> indeed
[12:07] <Speljohan_> err
[12:07] <Speljohan_> persistant game*
[12:07] <Lizzrd> people keep on killing simply
[12:07] <Speljohan_> there should always be something to do
[12:07] <yoshibot> well, in space you'd just have more places to build

[12:09] <yoshibot> and not EA fail
[12:09] <Speljohan_> shame spore sucked
[12:09] <Lizzrd> spore is horrible
[12:09] <Speljohan_> they only put content in for endgame
[12:09] <Speljohan_> space
[12:09] <yoshibot> spore is alright, not worth buying

[12:11] <Speljohan_> just some simple physics effects
[12:11] <Lizzrd> yeah
[12:11] <Lizzrd> and not just everything goes doooown
[12:11] <yoshibot> i gotta go actually work on this engine soon
[12:12] <Lizzrd> :P
[12:12] <vurtual> instead of tiny blocklets
[12:12] <vurtual> big ones
[12:12] <yoshibot> it'll be 2D, physics like cave story and with stuff buildable like Minecraft
[12:12] <Speljohan_> interesting yoshibot
[12:12] <Speljohan_> what lang
[12:12] <yoshibot> Java with a 2D accel library
[12:12] <Lizzrd> hey yoshibot
[12:12] <Speljohan_> bah
[12:12] <Speljohan_> just use lwjgl yoshibot
[12:13] <Speljohan_> !
[12:13] <Lizzrd> games you make up on the go like that usually doesn't get made
[12:13] <Speljohan_> i used to play around with slick2d
[12:13] <yoshibot> thing is, i think the 2D accel library is a wrapper on lwjgl
[12:13] <Speljohan_> but it wasnt as much fun
[12:13] <yoshibot> slick2d is what i plan to use
[12:13] <Speljohan_> as writing ur own
[12:13] <Speljohan_> i know it is :P
[12:13] <Lizzrd> yoshibot
[12:13] <Speljohan_> but i found lwjgl much better to work with directly
[12:13] <yoshibot> i want to actually get a game engine built.

[12:17] <vurtual> and escape pods and stuff
[12:17] <Lizzrd> on steam @ brainiac35
[12:17] <vurtual> There was medical stuff
[12:17] <yoshibot> thanks Lizzrd :3
[12:17] <vurtual> Also an item, which, when picked up, would make the opponet lose hp.
[12:17] <Lizzrd> i can show you some stuff i have made
[12:18] <Lizzrd> cause
[12:18] <yoshibot> that'd be great
[12:18] <vurtual> So you'd just go pew pew pew, then try to run for all the little bombs, and then pew pew pew.
[12:18] <Lizzrd> i consider myself better than the average spriter that goes here
[12:18] <Lizzrd> :3
[12:18] <yoshibot> should probably have a tech demo of the engine before i ask you for sprites

[12:20] <vurtual> Hmm
[12:20] <vurtual> I'm down to one last error for my tiny box-map
[12:20] <Speljohan_> only problem with using java is that you will not want to use all opengl functions yoshibot
[12:20] <Speljohan_> math should be done manually
[12:20] <Speljohan_> and not with the help of opengl
[12:20] <Speljohan_> cus jni is fairly slow
[12:21] <yoshibot> you'd be surprised how fast modern JVMs are
[12:21] <Speljohan_> but then, you will probably not need much math
[12:21] <Speljohan_> i know the jvm is fast
[12:21] <Speljohan_> but jni still isn't very fast

[13:34] <Snowman> :3
[13:35] <Subhazard> Yeah
[13:35] <Subhazard> This is quite obviously a trap.
[13:36] <Subhazard> Notch isn't cheeky.
[13:36] <Subhazard> He wouldn't request an elaborate mental obstacle course to just report errors.
[13:36] <Subhazard> It's not like you have to know how to program to test.
[13:36] <Snowman> What does maths have to do with testing mp survival?
[13:36] <Subhazard> Nothing.
[13:36] <Snowman> As goes for server administration
[13:36] <Snowman> That server administration test had no good answer btw
[13:37] <Snowman> The good answer would be: Place a spawn jail, set up a good number of rules, have a good number of trusted ops and make regular backups

[13:43] <Snowman> Great song
[13:43] <Subhazard> I correlated his sudden success as a game developer with the rather unscrupulous actions of the Goldman Sachs firm -- after thorough questioning I concluded that Notch had no ties with the scandal.
[13:43] <Subhazard> Although, Notch's first response was 'no comment' which rose my suspicions even more.
[13:44] <Subhazard> I met him at his apartment, and we indulged in a platter of patte and crackers. It only took a few shots of peppermint schnapps to get the answers I needed.
[13:44] <Subhazard> Yeah, he's clear.
[13:45] <Subhazard> My suspicions are now on LG_Legacy, who I have reason to believe is a Russian conspirator involved with the recent death of the Polish president.

[13:52] <Subhazard> I bought em today
[13:53] <Subhazard> Deus Ex is probably one of the most beloved games ever made.
[13:53] <Durandan> Meh, I never really liked Deus Ex
[13:53] <Subhazard> Has easily one of the best storylines ever crafted for a video game.
[13:53] <Durandan> I dunno, I just didn't get into it enough
[13:53] <Subhazard> It requires some intelligence and patience.
[13:53] <Subhazard> It's a very heady game.

[14:08] <Subhazard> But in steam, it's fucking crazy.

[14:08] <Durandan> No, I mean, on everything
[14:08] <Subhazard> You spoiled bitch
[14:08] <Subhazard> :P
[14:08] <Durandan> My torrents download at about 10-20kb/s
[14:08] <Wervyn> Might want to take that one up with your cable company.
[14:08] <Subhazard> So, Steam sux because your internet sux.
[14:08] <Speljohan_> i tend to buy games off steam and then download on usenet Subhazard
[14:08] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:08] <Superwafflez> I get up to 2mbps on steam...
[14:08] <Speljohan_> cus i get better speeds
[14:08] <Durandan> A lot of the internets is ok, even with that shitty speed
[14:08] <Durandan> I can play minecraft fine without lagging
[14:08] <Subhazard> I love Steam, they provide an excellent game matching service.
[14:08] <Superwafflez> My ISP mirrors most steam content though..
[14:09] <Durandan> But yeah, steam fucks that all up
[14:09] <Subhazard> I can also have my games on an account rather than in person, so that I'll never lose the discs.
[14:09] <Speljohan_> good for you, not for me though Subhazard
[14:09] <Splode> minecraft doesn't stream download, Durandan
[14:09] <Subhazard> The discs will never become scratched because I don't have them.
[14:09] <Speljohan_> i dont play with people i do not know

[14:10] <Subhazard> This is my first time not being homeless in 2 years :P
[14:10] <Durandan> I'm just saying that non-steam internet things work fine, while steam-type things don't
[14:10] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:10] <Subhazard> Might be a port.
[14:10] <Subhazard> Has nothing to do with steam.
[14:10] <Speljohan_> i would probably use steam to download shit if i actually maxed connection
[14:10] <Speljohan_> 1 hour vs 8 hours for a 10gb game is an easy choice
[14:11] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:11] <Subhazard> Steam is out of the way, it's lite, it provides a nice simple overlay for my games, I can download games rather than worrying about keeping copies, I can match up with friends VERY easily.
[14:11] <Speljohan_> it's NOT light
[14:11] <Speljohan_> it is ridiculously heavyweight
[14:11] <Speljohan_> for what it does

[14:12] <Wervyn> I disable it when I'm not using it. But, it makes grabbing a game very convenient.
[14:12] <Fagbeard> what are your specs Speljohan
[14:12] <Subhazard> Plus, Steam doesn't blast you with fucking restricitons all over the place.
[14:12] <Speljohan_> Fagbeard, laptop specs aren't particularily good
[14:12] <Fagbeard> well there you go
[14:12] <Speljohan_> 2gb ram, 1.8ghz core centrino
[14:12] <Speljohan_> buut
[14:12] <Speljohan_> it's sluggish on home pc as well
[14:12] <Fagbeard> :/
[14:12] <Superwafflez> OS?
[14:13] <Fagbeard> I've never had a problem with it
[14:13] <Speljohan_> and i have 8gb ram, quad cpu on that
[14:13] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:13] <Speljohan_> win7 Superwafflez
[14:13] <Speljohan_> yes yes i know, it sucks
[14:13] <Fagbeard> And I'm running motherfucking VISTA
[14:13] <Speljohan_> i'm going to downgrade
[14:13] <Speljohan_> vista > win7
[14:13] <Subhazard> ... what?
[14:13] <Superwafflez> Im on vista and just got conficker
[14:13] <Speljohan_> and that comes from someone who hated vista
[14:13] <Superwafflez> life is good
[14:13] <Subhazard> Well.
[14:13] <Subhazard> I've never had too much trouble with Vista.
[14:13] <Subhazard> It does what I ask.
[14:13] <Fagbeard> But DX11
[14:13] <Fagbeard> :C
[14:13] <alphanull> who said vista > win7
[14:13] <alphanull> who the hell
[14:13] <Speljohan_> i had trouble in the beginning
[14:13] <alphanull> said that
[14:13] <Speljohan_> like always
[14:13] <Speljohan_> with windows os's
[14:13] <Subhazard> I had to tweak it to get it to shut the fuck up.
[14:13] <Subhazard> Vista is incredibly annoying.
[14:13] <Durandan> XP for the win
[14:13] <Durandan> :D
[14:13] <Superwafflez> I want to know why the fuck vista doesnt have the fix for conficker
[14:14] <alphanull> win7 > xp > vista
[14:14] <Speljohan_> i'd use xp if it wasn't for bad memory management > 4gb
[14:14] <Subhazard> XP is too dated, as much as I like XP.. it's dated.
[14:14] <Fagbeard> XP has no multicore
[14:14] <Durandan> well shit
[14:14] <Superwafflez> Wat.
[14:14] <Durandan> That might be good to know

[14:15] <Speljohan_> same except for preferring win7 ylt
[14:15] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:15] <Subhazard> I get in arguments with Seattleites all the time.
[14:15] <Speljohan_> i'm surprised how many people microsoft managed to scam
[14:15] <alphanull> not one single problem with win7 here
[14:15] <ylt> explorer stack crashes are v.fun..
[14:15] <Speljohan_> "OMG WIN7!1223123123213 *cum*"

[14:15] <alphanull> its been the snappiest os
[14:16] <Subhazard> I wish Mozilla would fucking optimize
[14:16] <Speljohan_> just like vista and xp, win7 had tons of problems on release
[14:16] <Superwafflez> Win8 is meant to have a **!!NEW!!** UI.....
[14:16] <Subhazard> I'm so sick of the memory leak.
[14:16] <Speljohan_> HOWEVER
[14:16] <Speljohan_> it was less problems than vista/xp at release
[14:16] <Speljohan_> but still enough to annoy me
[14:16] <Subhazard> I'm sick of 'NEW UIS!'
[14:16] <Durandan> Yeah, windows always gave off this sense of kinda incompetent evil
[14:16] <Subhazard> Why is everyone always trying to innovate.
[14:16] <Speljohan_> ^
[14:16] <Subhazard> Use what works, and make that better.
[14:16] <Speljohan_> yeh
[14:16] <Subhazard> On that subject, FUCK PROJECT NATALE
[14:16] <Speljohan_> ribbon was the worst idea ever
[14:16] <Speljohan_> well
[14:16] <Fagbeard> NATAL
[14:16] <Speljohan_> forcing it upon us
[14:16] <Speljohan_> was fucking
[14:16] <Speljohan_> worst idea ever
[14:16] <Fagbeard> NATALE IS A GIRLS NAME
[14:16] <Superwafflez> Natal is actually quite promising.
[14:16] <Subhazard> Fuck you.
[14:16] <Fagbeard> But it's Peter Molynuex
[14:16] <Speljohan_> wtf is natal
[14:16] <Durandan> Welp, if something sounds like the worst idea ever and it still happened
[14:17] <Subhazard> I don't want to come home and relax by waving my arms around like an idiot.
[14:17] <Superwafflez> Fuck the Wiimote and wiifags.
[14:17] <alphanull> it has the potential to be pretty neat
[14:17] <Durandan> Either someone fucked up bigtime
[14:17] <Fagbeard> It'll probably turn out meh
[14:17] <Durandan> Or it somehow still manages to make them money

[14:17] <Fagbeard> but im interesting in what happens

[14:17] <Speljohan_> ps
[14:17] <Speljohan_> companies are generally forced to use windows more or less
[14:17] <Speljohan_> because it's cheap
[14:17] <Durandan> yeah
[14:17] <Durandan> chea[
[14:17] <Subhazard> Windows XP
[14:17] <Subhazard> ndows XP
[14:17] <Durandan> I got my ubuntu cd for, uh, lemme check
[14:17] <Speljohan_> so it doesn't matter at all how much it sucks
[14:17] <Subhazard> dows XP
[14:17] <Durandan> FREE
[14:17] <Subhazard> ows XP
[14:17] <Speljohan_> companies will keep goin for it
[14:17] <Superwafflez> It's not cheap... its just that everyone uses it...
[14:17] <Subhazard> XP
[14:18] <Subhazard> ---XP---
[14:18] <Speljohan_> it's cheap for companies Superwafflez
[14:18] <Speljohan_> :P
[14:18] <Subhazard> See, windows is sticking it's tongue out and laughing at you: Windows *XP*
[14:18] <Superwafflez> Only for large companies.
[14:18] <tPRoC> windows is ultimately the superior OS, despite it's flaws
[14:18] <alphanull> ubuntu is not fit for business distribution
[14:18] <tPRoC> you have to consider the alternatives
[14:18] <Durandan> Yeah, people don't have the knowledge or inclination to change computers from the OS they come with
[14:18] <Speljohan_> they have licenses for small companies too
[14:18] <alphanull> no matter how hard you want it to be
[14:18] <Speljohan_> tPRoC, it's like this:
[14:18] <tPRoC> linux is okay for some things but it's somewhat bloated
[14:18] <Subhazard> I tried ubuntu
[14:18] <Speljohan_> windows is a neccessary evil
[14:18] <Subhazard> It was a pain in the ass to get drivers for, and I wasn't in the mood to fuck with it anymore.

[14:19] <alphanull> i have ever heard
[14:19] <Subhazard> Linux =/= bloated
[14:19] <Speljohan_> UBUNTU is bloated
[14:19] <Speljohan_> not linux
[14:19] <Subhazard> Ubuntu is not bloated either.
[14:19] <Speljohan_> yes it is

[14:22] <Speljohan_> because

[14:24] <alphanull> or is he just shitting money

[14:24] <Speljohan_> flash is the worst shit ever made

[14:25] <Speljohan_> microsoft goes "WE FIXT BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY HRUR DURR"
[14:26] <Speljohan_> 'sif they did
[14:26] <tPRoC> i like the taskbar, personally
[14:26] <Speljohan_> they just added a fucking windows xp image
[14:26] <ylt> i prefer the taskbar.. allows me to use 8gb of my ram and be able to find the windows at same time
[14:26] <Speljohan_> and lets you emulate the os
[14:26] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:26] <tPRoC> i like how if you hover your mouse over a window on the taskbar
[14:26] <tPRoC> it'll show you a mini-display of it.
[14:26] <Speljohan_> uhh ylt
[14:26] <Speljohan_> the taskbar doesnt use any ram
[14:26] <Speljohan_> ..
[14:26] <Superwafflez> well if you want to sell a shitload of retouched vista copies, brag about the features it has, even if they're crap.
[14:26] <ylt> i know
[14:26] <Speljohan_> i use like 3gb ram at max
[14:26] <Speljohan_> at all times
[14:26] <Speljohan_> well
[14:26] <Speljohan_> except for when i'm programming
[14:26] <Speljohan_> heavyweight ide's
[14:26] <Speljohan_> usually 4 or 5 of them
[14:26] <ylt> but lots of windows in previous versions of windows.. would make them not fit on taskbar

[14:28] <tPRoC> right
[14:28] <tPRoC> also windows are grouped
[14:28] <Superwafflez> group similar taskbar programs?

[14:28] <Speljohan_> with an image of each window

[14:34] <tPRoC> i really don't like chrome
[14:34] <tPRoC> it looks so bare.
[14:34] <tPRoC> plus.
[14:34] <Varriount> I use ubuntu on a 6 year old pc.. It doesn't act sluggish
[14:34] <tPRoC> images load much slower than they do on firefox.
[14:34] <tPRoC> i don't know why.
[14:34] <ylt> yeah.. chrome is horrible
[14:35] <Speljohan_> <tPRoC> it looks so bare.
[14:35] <Speljohan_> that's what i love :P
[14:35] <Varriount> Firefox all the way!
[14:35] <tPRoC> firefox is what i use at the moment
[14:35] <tPRoC> but they're starting to piss me off.
[14:35] <Speljohan_> i stopped using firefox after 2.0
[14:35] <Speljohan_> because it bigger and more bloated
[14:35] <Speljohan_> and slower
[14:35] <Speljohan_> for each release
[14:35] <ylt> still use firefox due to its extensions... even though its quite bloated
[14:35] <Speljohan_> slower as in software
[14:35] <tPRoC> it's getting worse each release, yeah.
[14:35] <Speljohan_> not as in webbrowsing
[14:35] <Speljohan_> i never used any extensions lol
[14:36] * Snowman|Deus_ex is now known as Snowman
[14:36] <Speljohan_> anyways, chrome has a massive db of extensions now as well
[14:36] <Snowman> FF hogs the CPU for me
[14:36] <Speljohan_> just that i'll never use them
[14:36] <Snowman> So I use Opera now
[14:36] <tPRoC> firefox will flip the fuck out
[14:36] <tPRoC> and do stupid shit all the time.
[14:36] <tPRoC> also, it ends up looking for updates on its own.
[14:36] <tPRoC> and fucking crashes itself.
[14:36] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:36] <Speljohan_> i have had 1 crash in chrome since release
[14:36] <Speljohan_> and even then it was no problem
[14:36] <Speljohan_> cus just 1 tab crashed

[14:39] <haxelnut> notch, you here?
[14:39] <ylt> very nice for google/forums
[14:39] <Merciless> is it possible, theoretically to earn a living off web ads
[14:39] <Merciless> or is that a myth
[14:39] <haxelnut> mythbusters
[14:39] <haxelnut> gonna find out :D
[14:39] <ylt> if you somehow get them onto google homepage.. then maybe xD
[14:39] <tPRoC> it is, probably.
[14:39] <tPRoC> if you have enough ads.
[14:39] <tPRoC> depends on the type of ad too.
[14:40] <Speljohan_> <Merciless> is it possible, theoretically to earn a living off web ads
[14:40] <Speljohan_> very possible
[14:40] <Speljohan_> i was fairly close
[14:40] <Speljohan_> :P

[14:40] <tPRoC> webcomic artists do it all the time.
[14:40] <tPRoC> also, most people want a minecraft.
[14:40] <Speljohan_> i made $1.6k/mo aproximately Merciless
[14:40] <Speljohan_> from 3x google ads
[14:40] <haxelnut> XD
[14:40] <tPRoC> but notch refuses to add it, simply because it will make minecraft similar to other FPS'

[14:40] <ylt> clickjacking ads would be pretty effective (basically, make clicking somewhere force clicking ad)
[14:40] <Speljohan_> illegal tho ylt
[14:41] <Speljohan_> on most ad providers anyway
[14:41] <ylt> hmmm, suppose so
[14:41] <haxelnut> yup, its illegal
[14:41] <Speljohan_> well, obviously not illegal as such
[14:41] <Speljohan_> just aganist their tos
[14:41] <Speljohan_> which can result in account termination
[14:41] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:41] <Roadcrosser> I HATE TYNT
[14:41] <Speljohan_> btw on those $1.6k/mo equalled to about
[14:41] <Speljohan_> 260 clicks a day
[14:41] * Cat is now known as TYNT
[14:42] <TYNT> i hate u too!
[14:42] <Speljohan_> and 200-300k visits per day

[14:42] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:42] <haxelnut> gosh i hate ads
[14:42] <Roadcrosser> tynt is a script silly
[14:42] <tPRoC> i just hate pop-ups.
[14:42] <Cat> xD
[14:42] <Cat> how do i know im a cat
[14:42] <Astroman> So no, it's not possible to make a living of ads.
[14:42] <tPRoC> mostly because nobody ever fucking pays attention to pop-ups.
[14:42] <Astroman> Not in reality
[14:42] <tPRoC> yet people still try and use it as a form of advertising.
[14:42] <Speljohan_> it is possible Astroman
[14:42] <Speljohan_> just not viable
[14:42] <tPRoC> and it just ends up annoying people.
[14:43] <Speljohan_> it could change over a day
[14:43] <Astroman> Yes in rare cases.
[14:43] <Roadcrosser> tynt is a script that detects everything you copy on that page
[14:43] <Speljohan_> i lived off it for a year
[14:43] <Astroman> What kind of website did you run?
[14:43] <Pumiotto> aarrrr... i gotta go :P cya all :P

[14:44] <Astroman> Nice
[14:44] <tPRoC> i enjoyed runescape's quests.
[14:44] <Speljohan_> and since bot was free
[14:44] <Speljohan_> and open source
[14:44] <tPRoC> mostly because they weren't just fetch quests.
[14:45] <Speljohan_> it got 999999 people
[14:45] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:45] <tPRoC> aside from that the game was just a grind.
[14:45] <Speljohan_> they do have well designed quests tPRoC
[14:45] <Speljohan_> compared to other mmo's anyway
[14:45] <Astroman> Runescape was so shit, but when you are like 12 wtf do you know. :P
[14:45] <tPRoC> it's not that bad
[14:45] <tPRoC> there are far worse mmos
[14:45] <tPRoC> see: korean mmos
[14:45] <eritz> saying that one MMO has good quests compared to another MMO
[14:45] <Astroman> Well yes.
[14:45] <Astroman> True
[14:45] <eritz> is not saying much
[14:45] <Astroman> Indeed.
[14:45] <Speljohan_> eritz true
[14:45] <Astroman> MMO quests are really bad.
[14:45] <Merciless> MU online runied my life for well over 2 years
[14:45] <Speljohan_> for a reason Astroman
[14:46] <Speljohan_> they are only there as a timesink
[14:46] <Astroman> Yep.
[14:46] <Speljohan_> because mmo's are fucking glorified arcade games
[14:46] <tPRoC> i can't stand DOTA, League of Legends, or Heroes of Newerth.
[14:46] <tPRoC> not because the games are bad.
[14:46] <tPRoC> but because holy shit
[14:46] <tPRoC> those games have some of the worst

[14:46] <tPRoC> ever.
[14:46] <Speljohan_> i dont like them either tPRoC

[14:47] <Speljohan_> :D
[14:47] <Astroman> SWG before it got ruined was very nice. :3
[14:47] <Speljohan_> and when i kill them i skin them
[14:47] <tPRoC> ahaha
[14:47] <Speljohan_> and cook body parts
[14:47] <Speljohan_> and consume
[14:47] <tPRoC> Lego made an MMO.
[14:47] <eritz> thing about RO is, every unoriginal retard rolls assassin
[14:47] <mnjiman> i beta tested Dota..
[14:47] <Astroman> Haha. Ok.
[14:47] <eritz> and most of them are the exact same build
[14:47] <tPRoC> i've talked to people who made it in to the beta.
[14:47] <tPRoC> of Lego Universe.
[14:47] <Speljohan_> but yeah, SWG was great Astroman
[14:47] <tPRoC> apparently it's terrible.
[14:47] <Astroman> Oh yeah I'm in the Lego beta. Thanks for reminding me. x)
[14:47] <Speljohan_> same designer as uo
[14:48] <Speljohan_> mr raph koster
[14:48] <Speljohan_> my house-god
[14:48] <tPRoC> it's supposedly really linear and restrictive.
[14:48] <mnjiman> I never liked dota..
[14:48] <tPRoC> which is odd, since it's lego.

[14:48] <eritz> when most assassins in the game are spec'd to be good at one move and one move only, it's trivial to make a build that's completely invulnerable to that type of damage
[14:48] <Astroman> Well, it's for children. It has to be.
[14:48] <Astroman> I guess.
[14:48] <eritz> and troll the shit out of the nubs that think the build is godly
[14:48] <Astroman> Or SA comes and builds giant cocks everywhere.
[14:49] <Speljohan_> winbar
[14:49] <Speljohan_> must do that
[14:49] <tPRoC> lego sucks these days.
[14:49] <Speljohan_> i concur
[14:49] <Speljohan_> lego was pro when i was a kid
[14:49] <tPRoC> the minifigures are now skin-coloured.
[14:49] <tPRoC> instead of yellow.
[14:49] <Speljohan_> WHAT
[14:49] <Speljohan_> WTF
[14:49] <Astroman> Same here.
[14:49] <Speljohan_> BLASPHEMY
[14:49] <tPRoC> also, they use too many context-sensetive parts.
[14:49] <BearClaw89> thats not lego!
[14:49] <Speljohan_> GODDAMN BLASPHEMY
[14:49] <Astroman> And I was too young to have the "small wheels" if anyone knows what I mean.
[14:50] <Speljohan_> loll
[14:50] <eritz> there's still plenty of yellow skin and multipurpose bricks
[14:50] <eritz> you just have to know what kinds of sets to buy to get them
[14:50] <Astroman> Yeah.
[14:50] <Speljohan_> back in da days life was a sandbox of joy
[14:50] <Speljohan_> now it is a restricted piece of shit and you just want to cry
[14:50] <Astroman> Nowadays it's too restricted.
[14:50] <Astroman> Yeah
[14:50] <Othilious1> That's because kids these days have zero imagination.
[14:50] <Speljohan_> if one could only stay kid forever..
[14:51] <tPRoC> true.
[14:51] <tPRoC> so fucking true.
[14:51] <tPRoC> the games these days that appeal to kids are
[14:51] <Speljohan_> it's so funny
[14:51] <tPRoC> MW2 and Halo
[14:51] <Speljohan_> because
[14:51] <Astroman> When me and my brothers played Lego we always said "Ok, Air, Land, Sea or Space?" xD
[14:51] <Speljohan_> my parents pretty much always say i have 0 imagination
[14:51] <tPRoC> Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon now make awful shows
[14:51] <Speljohan_> just imagine what they did
[14:51] <tPRoC> that are completely retarded in every aspect
[14:51] <Speljohan_> play with sticks and rocks!
[14:51] <eritz> when i babysit, i set up the SNES
[14:51] <Astroman> Haha, yeah.
[14:51] <Othilious1> They want a frikkin road map to everything, the moment ir requires some intelligent thought, it's "too hard" and they give up. I blame the educational system XD.
[14:51] <eritz> the kids usually end up enjoying some super mario world
[14:51] <Speljohan_> yeh
[14:52] <Speljohan_> that's what i did eritz !
[14:52] <Speljohan_> i played smb3 like all da time when i was a kid
[14:52] <Astroman> Kids these days know shit about computers
[14:52] <Speljohan_> oh and tons of nes games
[14:52] <Astroman> Even though they sit on them all the time.
[14:52] <eritz> i'm a bit of a collector
[14:52] <eritz> i have a lot of old consoles, in functioning condition
[14:52] <Speljohan_> it's always going to be like that though Astroman
[14:52] <tPRoC> i like how old people interact with computers.
[14:52] <tPRoC> seriously.
[14:52] <Astroman> Well yeah, but there is a difference
[14:52] <tPRoC> a lot of old people would physically place the mouse
[14:52] <Speljohan_> i wouldn't expect an old person to know dick about computers
[14:52] <Othilious1> Case in point: Friend of mine does university level programming courses, yet didn't know what hte taskmanager was -_-
[14:52] <tPRoC> on the screen.
[14:53] <tPRoC> and move it around if you told them to move the mouse around on the screen.
[14:53] <Speljohan_> hell, i don't even see a reason for old people to own a computer
[14:53] <Speljohan_> they have no use for it
[14:53] <Speljohan_> at all
[14:53] <tPRoC> uhhh
[14:53] <Speljohan_> something which my grandfolks realized long ago
[14:53] <tPRoC> what else are they going to do

[14:58] <Speljohan_> Astroman, i listen to the "modern" incarnation of black sabbath etc as well
[14:58] <tPRoC> i shouldn't even be using a computer.
[14:58] <Speljohan_> ie, stoner and doom

[14:59] <Speljohan_> Astroman, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9Qdj7pt7Iw
[14:59] <Speljohan_> ALOT of influence from black sabbath
[14:59] <Speljohan_> just more groovy
[14:59] <tPRoC> so
[14:59] <Astroman> Yeah. ^^ A bit too heavy for my taste though. I'm a bluesman at heart. xD

[15:00] <Astroman> Yeah.
[15:00] <tPRoC> ?
[15:00] <Speljohan_> Astroman, basically, the singer used to sing in a grindcore band lolol
[15:00] <Speljohan_> and he decided to try do something heavy on another front
[15:00] <eritz> as for me...
[15:00] <Speljohan_> so he went back to the roots
[15:00] <Speljohan_> and ended up with this
[15:00] <Astroman> I like the Warning cover that Sabbath did on their first album.
[15:00] <eritz> ...i'm currently listening to japanese electronica
[15:00] <Astroman> Ah. :)
[15:00] <Speljohan_> :P
[15:00] <Astroman> One thing I really can't stand though
[15:00] <Speljohan_> yeah, warning is awesome
[15:00] <Astroman> Is Screamo etc
[15:00] * Murgy (Mibbit@174.35.216.4) has joined #minecraft
[15:00] <Speljohan_> screamo is for emos
[15:01] <tPRoC> i don't like japanese music simply because their language lets them make sounds that are difficult to do in english without sounding like a retard
[15:01] <Astroman> Yeah, but any "singing" where they just scream and growl. Yeah k..
[15:01] <Speljohan_> loll
[15:01] <Speljohan_> tPRoC, i only like 1 japanese band!
[15:01] <tPRoC> and if i listen to it i seem like a wapanese
[15:01] <Speljohan_> that sings in japanese
[15:01] <tPRoC> :(
[15:01] <Speljohan_> and english for that matter

[15:02] <Astroman> xD
[15:02] <eritz> but a lot of the stuff is listenable
[15:02] <Speljohan_> he writes the english lyrics by converting with a translator
[15:02] <Speljohan_> rifk
[15:02] <tPRoC> ahahaha
[15:02] <Speljohan_> but it's more funny in japanese
[15:02] <Speljohan_> cus his voice

[15:06] <Speljohan_> early 80's

[15:08] <eritz> i should get to watching star trek
[15:08] <eritz> i've seen plenty of episodes over the years, and it's a pretty good show
[15:08] <Speljohan_> best timesink ever
[15:08] <Astroman> I'm not a big fan of the 80's music. The tone and effects etc. :)
[15:08] <Astroman> Oh and no, have not seen it.
[15:08] <Astroman> The guitar hero episode was lol though
[15:08] <Speljohan_> guitar hero is so bad

[15:08] <Astroman> Yes

[15:08] <eritz> of course
[15:09] <Speljohan_> i'm watching voyager at the moment
[15:09] <Astroman> I hate people who spend so much time getting amazing at it.
[15:09] <eritz> you've got your original series, your DS9, TNG, voyager...
[15:09] <eritz> i have some friends who watch

[15:17] <Astroman> O_O
[15:17] <Speljohan_> :P
[15:17] <Astroman> Haha
[15:17] <Speljohan_> early metal always had feeling no matter how fast or heavy they were
[15:18] <Speljohan_> because their main influences was shit like yngwie malmsteen Astroman
[15:18] <Speljohan_> and they wanted to play as good as him
[15:18] <Speljohan_> and in the long run created their own style
[15:18] <Astroman> yeah
[15:18] <Astroman> Nowadays it's just
[15:18] <Speljohan_> nowadays they just do drop d
[15:18] <Astroman> Get tab and "play" it in bedroom.
[15:18] <Speljohan_> and replace solos with breakdowns

[15:19] <Astroman> :)
[15:21] <Speljohan_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHl53xXPxhE same genre, more melodic and focus on neo-classical theme. Jump to 2:25 and listen to that fucking solo. It's amazing
[15:21] <Speljohan_> Astroman, ^
[15:21] <Speljohan_> it's not as fast paced, more focus on feeling

[15:32] <Astroman> Yeah, you said they were swedish? Might explain it
[15:32] <Speljohan_> :P
[15:32] <Astroman> Sweden is not a good place to "start".
[15:32] <Speljohan_> they are still massive in the underground scene obviously

[15:34] <Speljohan_> in sm?land
[15:34] <Astroman> Never heard of xD

[15:34] <Speljohan_> first year was last year
[15:34] <Astroman> ^^
[15:34] <Speljohan_> but
[15:34] <Speljohan_> it had visitors from germany, spain and italy last year

[15:46] <Superwafflez> flash runs on iphone...
[15:46] <Konogan> Rofl
[15:47] <bildramer> only rarely it's actually usseful
[15:47] <bildramer> se*
[15:47] <Speljohan_> if they actually made flash not suck
[15:47] <eritz> the best answer to that is to have a button, by which you can turn flash ON and OFF
[15:47] <Speljohan_> eg remove the cpu-hog elements
[15:47] <bildramer> lol
[15:47] <eritz> not to have it off 100% of the time
[15:47] <Speljohan_> i'd not mind
[15:47] <Superwafflez> it works on iphones rofl
[15:47] <Othilious1> Honestly, the only sites I use that require flash, are sites that use it to plat video. But the iphone DOES do flash video...
[15:47] <Speljohan_> with jailbreak i assume
[15:47] <eritz> http://www.mikechambers.com/blog/2010/04/20/on-adobe-flash-cs5-and-iphone-applications/

[15:47] <Superwafflez> jailbreak and android =D
[15:47] <Speljohan_> lol
[15:48] <Speljohan_> no point getting an iphone anyway
[15:48] <eritz> as far as the iPad is concerned

[15:48] <Speljohan_> 1 week battery lifelength
[15:48] <Speljohan_> !
[15:48] <eritz> imagine it
[15:48] <Superwafflez> I get a day out of my iphone

[15:49] <Speljohan_> BUT IPAD IS SHINY AND WHITE :3
[15:49] <Astroman> iPad is just a loyalty test for apple users
[15:49] <Speljohan_> yeah
[15:49] <Speljohan_> now we can see who are the real fanboys
[15:49] <Astroman> To see how far they can push it
[15:49] <Speljohan_> lo lyeah
[15:49] <Astroman> Before even the biggest tards wake up xD
[15:49] <Superwafflez> I hope.
[15:49] <eritz> yeah, iPad is squarely in 'MacBook Wheel' territory
[15:49] <Othilious1> I love how everyone is jsut going "oooeee shiny new tablet PCs!" When I'm typing this on my 2 year old tablet :P

[17:11] <Hikoboshi> xD
[17:11] <Knight85> Nobody really cares what you do in your single player game
[17:11] <Snowman> Bodie, do you gly and stuff in fpses?
[17:11] <Snowman> Do you fly and stuff in RPGs?
[17:11] <Bodie> no
[17:11] <Snowman> Do you fly and stuff in platformers?
[17:12] <Snowman> Then why do it in Minecraft?
[17:12] <Bodie> because its a building game
[17:12] <Hikoboshi> garrysmod..... and aion.... /twocents
[17:12] <Bodie> its about the building, not the movement
[17:12] <Snowman> I would say RTSes but in almost all of them, you DO fly
[17:12] <Knight85> hehe aion.. grind online
[17:12] <Bodie> and i'm not saying i AGREE with it
[17:12] <Bodie> i'm just saying why its so common
[17:12] <Hikoboshi> shush, aion is nice.
[17:12] <Bodie> you can't have an unfair advantage in a game with no aim or goal
[17:12] <Rithiur> Aion looks nice, but that's about all it has
[17:12] <Snowman> They could've made those fpses, rpgs, platformers, etc with flying

[17:13] <Snowman> Notch doesn't want his game to have flying
[17:13] <Bodie> i'm pretty sure i'm not saying i want flying

[17:13] <Bodie> i was the one saying i'd like an option to turn all that shit off
[17:13] <Hikoboshi> it's hard to make flying an integral part of gameplay, that's why it's not usual
[17:13] <Knight85> Anyway, minecraft shouldn't have flying in multiplayer. And honestly I feel more accomplishment when I building something without using that stuff
[17:13] <Snowman> I'd like an option to just get rid of all of it for good
[17:13] <Bodie> yeah definitely
[17:13] <Snowman> But some other people are stupid and lazy and have to hack
[17:14] <Bodie> like i said, it makes anything anyone builds far less impressive
[17:14] <LG_Legacy> GOOD JOB YOU PLACED A BLOCK
[17:14] <LG_Legacy> Thats what really matters?
[17:14] <LG_Legacy> A block?
[17:14] <Bodie> beacuse you dont know if they've flown around and built it
[17:14] <Hikoboshi> i'd want flying just to turn it on if i fall off my scaffolds by accident
[17:14] <Hikoboshi> so i don't die
[17:14] <Hikoboshi> splat
[17:14] <Bodie> its just part of the fun :P
[17:14] <Hikoboshi> >.>
[17:14] <Knight85> Thats the risk you take :)
[17:14] <Roadcrosser> then get a Booster 2.0
[17:14] <Bodie> in multiplayer you'll respawn anyway
[17:14] <Bodie> not as bad as in indev
[17:14] <Hikoboshi> i know it's a risk
[17:14] <Bodie> fall, dead
[17:14] <Bodie> no base
[17:14] <Knight85> Just minus your stuff :)
[17:15] <Hikoboshi> oh yeah, but you drop your stuff
[17:15] <Bodie> thats what chests are for
[17:15] <Bodie> :p
[17:15] <Bodie> i like it
[17:15] <Bodie> it makes chests usefull
[17:15] <Bodie> moreso anyway
[17:15] <Snowman> I'm off now
[17:15] <Snowman> Cyall
[17:15] <Bodie> bye
[17:15] <Roadcrosser> Minecraft should have a booster 2.0
[17:15] <Hikoboshi> and lack of saves make creepers and such more dangerous
[17:15] <Hikoboshi> see ya
[17:15] <Bodie> will chests be only accesable by the creator?
[17:15] <alphanull> no, but seriously. did notch buy a macbook pro just so he can work on compatibility or does he like macs
[17:15] <Knight85> I think people are going to find it'll be a lot harder to raid people's chests than they think

[17:16] <Bodie> whys that knight85?
[17:16] <Knight85> Its going to be hard to find people's hiding places if they're smart
[17:16] <Hikoboshi> suddenly sentries, thousands of them?
[17:16] <Bodie> true
[17:16] <Knight85> For example, it gives a reason to turn cobblestone back into stone
[17:16] <Bodie> hehe
[17:16] <Bodie> i admit it will be cool
[17:16] <Knight85> So you can hide the fact anyone ever dug there
[17:16] <Roadcrosser> we need a "You can deposit stuff in here but you can't take out what you put in if you close the chest and reopen it but the owner can open it and retrieve what is inside" chest
[17:17] <Pi_Master> I've been making stone for a while now. OCD...
[17:17] <Knight85> Nah, chests are fine as is
[17:17] <Hikoboshi> cobblestone is ugly
[17:17] <Knight85> Just pick a good spot to hide it
[17:17] <Bodie> yeah
[17:17] <Roadcrosser> lets refine cobblestone into pebbles
[17:17] <Bodie> the thing that makes minecraft great is its simplicity
[17:17] <Knight85> I don't want any magical lockboxes
[17:17] <Bodie> adding too many rules mess it up

[17:18] <Roadcrosser> lets get notch to make a MineGate
[17:18] <Bodie> hmm
[17:18] <Hikoboshi> no, i was kidding
[17:18] <Bodie> i think its good keeping your stuff knight

[17:19] <Pi_Master> I can't wait for notch to make doors...
[17:19] <Knight85> It gets balanced by the risk of carrying valuable stuff you can drop while logged in
[17:19] <Bodie> i spose
[17:19] <Pi_Master> soooooooooooo annoying having to break a block and replace it just to keep things out of your house...

[17:20] <Profanwolf> Huh
[17:20] <Knight85> Maybe on co-ops
[17:20] <Profanwolf> You mean in indev mp?
[17:20] <Bodie> nah of course they'll make big towns and stuff
[17:20] <Bodie> i can't wait
[17:21] <Pi_Master> I build 3 story 3x3 buildings
[17:21] <Knight85> Just hide the stuff in the holes :p
[17:21] <Profanwolf> The ground will be like swiss cheese when we have enough to make skyscrapers.
[17:21] <Pi_Master> I have tons of rooms left empty...
[17:21] <Bodie> lol knight
[17:21] <Pi_Master> and my roof becomes a green house...
[17:21] <Bodie> so true
[17:21] <Bodie> it'll be like real life
[17:21] <Bodie> these massive super pits
[17:21] <Bodie> just to find some gold
[17:21] <Hikoboshi> i hope that drop-sand-on-yourself-to-see-through-the-ground glitch is fixed by multiplayer, it'd break everything

[17:21] <Profanwolf> D:
[17:22] <Hikoboshi> xD
[17:22] <Bodie> http://www.gold-net.com.au/archivemagazines/aug01/kal2.jpg
[17:22] <Pi_Master> read the dev list...notch is going to replace indev with infdev
[17:22] <Bodie> actual screenshot taken in infdev
[17:22] <Knight85> Yeah obviously
[17:22] <Bodie> i made a castle
[17:22] <Bodie> :P
[17:22] <Knight85> and then it becomes beta down the road
[17:22] <Roadcrosser> yes?
[17:22] <Roadcrosser> you called me?
[17:22] <Hikoboshi> lols, it almost has the blocky aesthetic
[17:23] <Profanwolf> except
[17:23] <Bodie> lol yeah
[17:23] <Profanwolf> everything is round
[17:23] <Profanwolf> D:
[17:23] <Bodie> i've been to that pit

[17:23] <mnjiman> Bodie
[17:23] <mnjiman> i love your castle
[17:23] <Profanwolf> making dams in creative mp is fun
[17:23] <Profanwolf> will be better when we have finite water
[17:24] <Hikoboshi> and flowing water
[17:24] <Knight85> I think the big issue will who to trust. I can invision clans having a server and just inviting all comers to take them on or something.
[17:24] <Pi_Master> finite water is annoying...you try to irrigate and all you get is dry ground...
[17:24] <Profanwolf> I'll just host my own server and play with people i know really
[17:24] <Knight85> Yeah I really hope the water is fixed
[17:24] <sppt> o der u are cowie
[17:24] <mnjiman> Pi master
[17:24] <Profanwolf> I don't trust pubbies too much
[17:24] <Hikoboshi> now you can just make tunnels with water as the roof
[17:24] <mnjiman> Ive irrigated multiple times with on issue
[17:24] <mnjiman> no*
[17:24] <Pi_Master> were you using an island map?
[17:24] <Profanwolf> It's kinda weird in infdev though
[17:24] <Knight85> Half the fun is dealing with the hostiles profan :)
[17:25] <Profanwolf> Very true
[17:25] <Profanwolf> though, i can keep it private until we have a massive castle
[17:25] <Profanwolf> and then open it up
[17:25] <Profanwolf> :D
[17:25] <Hikoboshi> didn't notch say something about wanting infdev water to behave differently than indev water, do avoid the evaporation problem?
[17:25] <Profanwolf> Not sure
[17:25] <mnjiman> no Pi
[17:25] <Roadcrosser> umm
[17:25] <mnjiman> my castle map is Inland
[17:25] * Cat (PyroPyro@77.46.188.33) Quit (Quit: Roger over and out, PyroPyro)

[17:26] <Pi_Master> huh...weird...
[17:26] <mnjiman> look
[17:26] <Knight85> I think that would be a good way to have clan wars profan, just raid each other's server
[17:26] <Profanwolf> I feel like having some noodles.
[17:26] <Pi_Master> I seem to always have trouble with irrigation. can't wait for buckets too.
[17:26] <Profanwolf> shit i ate them all last night
[17:26] <Knight85> And their big giant castle

[17:26] <mnjiman> http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/421/castlejames.jpg
[17:26] <Roadcrosser> if dynamic water is touching another dynamic block which is touching another-which is touching a static block it spreads
[17:26] <Profanwolf> We need a way to make siege weapons
[17:26] <mnjiman> in the middle of there is my farm land
[17:26] <Profanwolf> though
[17:26] <Bodie> wow
[17:26] <mnjiman> i diverted water half a map away
[17:26] <Bodie> wtf
[17:26] <Bodie> is that in infdev?
[17:26] <Profanwolf> also didnt notch say something about making torches burn out after a while?
[17:26] <Profanwolf> i hope he doesnt :(
[17:27] <mnjiman> no that Indev
[17:27] <Bodie> ah
[17:27] <Bodie> still
[17:27] <Bodie> impressive
[17:27] <Pi_Master> mnjiman how long'd that take to build? XD
[17:27] <Knight85> Youll have lanterns profan
[17:27] <Bodie> wheres the giant hole that you got the resources from?
[17:27] <Hikoboshi> all of infdev's water is static now
[17:27] <mnjiman> 20-40hours
[17:27] <Profanwolf> Yep
[17:27] * twangy (twangy@125.168.214.170) has joined #minecraft
[17:27] <Knight85> Lanterns will be the new permanent
[17:27] <Mive> Profanwolf: He did, but there will also be something like lanterns
[17:27] <mnjiman> i have two places
[17:27] <Profanwolf> yeah, knight just said, and good.
[17:27] <mnjiman> sorry
[17:27] <mnjiman> three
[17:27] <Hikoboshi> oh good, so there will still be a permanent light
[17:27] <mnjiman> Gaint mine underneath
[17:27] <mnjiman> the Moat around my castle
[17:27] <Profanwolf> Having your stuff burn out while youre inside your mine
[17:27] <igotyou> yeah
[17:27] <Profanwolf> would be .. painful
[17:27] <mnjiman> 10x10
[17:27] <igotyou> hel'l make a
[17:28] <igotyou> latern thats permanent and the torch will be tempoary
[17:28] <mnjiman> and another place i cleared out somewhere
[17:28] <igotyou> i think i heard
[17:28] <igotyou> somewhere
[17:28] <Profanwolf> Two people already said that gotyou.
[17:28] <Knight85> torches will be more for that temporary shelter while you're on expedition
[17:28] <Pi_Master> I make a stairwell digging down and then on the side dig a big square...so it turns into a big mineshaft
[17:28] <mnjiman> Pi Master
[17:28] <Hikoboshi> that'll screw with the airlock design
[17:28] <Pi_Master> yessum?
[17:28] <Profanwolf> Makes sense.
[17:28] <mnjiman> The trick to divert water is making sure you have a slope
[17:28] * Codlike (Codlike@ppp118-210-255-180.lns20.adl6.internode.on.net) has joined #minecraft
[17:28] <mnjiman> so every 10 or so blocks i went down hill
[17:28] <Profanwolf> Which is hard, when you want to actually build a castle
[17:28] <igotyou> yeah
[17:28] <Knight85> lanterns will probably behave the same way I'd think Hikoboshi
[17:28] <Profanwolf> And want a moat or something
[17:28] <mnjiman> Well
[17:28] <Profanwolf> maybe the lanterns will be a block
[17:29] <Profanwolf> or something
[17:29] <igotyou> hmm mabye
[17:29] <Hikoboshi> hrm
[17:29] <mnjiman> Im going to divert massive amount of water for my moat
[17:29] <Profanwolf> instead of the wall attachment the torch has
[17:29] <Profanwolf> but who knows
[17:29] <Knight85> The main issue with castles right now is the ability to make block towers and just go over the wall
[17:29] <Profanwolf> Yeah.
[17:29] <twangy> Colliding with lanterns wouldnt make sense
[17:29] <mnjiman> from about ten places on my map
[17:29] <Pi_Master> mnjiman I always seem to drain the water instead of making it go somewhere...
[17:29] <Profanwolf> Hah
[17:29] <Hikoboshi> i bet they'd be more expensive to make, resource-wise
[17:29] <twangy> Yeah,
[17:29] <Profanwolf> It's fun to set stuff you make in creative
[17:29] <Profanwolf> on fire in indev
[17:29] <Profanwolf> I made a hotel out of cloth
[17:29] <mnjiman> well
[17:29] <Pi_Master> it'd be nice if lanterns set zombies on fire
[17:29] <Profanwolf> imported into omen
[17:29] <twangy> Its even better to use tnt
[17:29] <Profanwolf> exported into .mclevel
[17:29] <Profanwolf> i had 50 blocks of tnt in the basement
[17:30] <Profanwolf> :D
[17:30] <twangy> ^
[17:30] <twangy> Win.

[17:30] <Knight85> Personally I'm looking forward to mobs not despawning, then you can use them as a defensive weapon
[17:30] <twangy> I crashed Java with fire/tnt/creeper.
[17:30] <mnjiman> i can pass it to you
[17:30] <Profanwolf> You know what would be interesting?
[17:30] <Profanwolf> friendly mobs
[17:30] <Knight85> Hollow walls filled with skellys :)
[17:30] <Bodie> defensive mobs
[17:30] <Profanwolf> Like guards
[17:30] <Bodie> ohhh
[17:30] <mnjiman> so you can take a look at what i did
[17:30] <Bodie> defense against
[17:30] <Bodie> yeahhh
[17:30] <Profanwolf> In the zombie defense mod
[17:30] <twangy> Or farming sheep/piggiesh
[17:30] <Profanwolf> you could spawn a guard
[17:30] <Knight85> Yeah, would solve the whole defenseless castle problem
[17:30] <Profanwolf> that would always stay within a certain block radius
[17:30] <Pi_Master> mnjiman naw. I normally don't use irrigation anyway. XD my gardens tend to be on the top of my 3 story buildings...no irrigation.
[17:30] <Profanwolf> which could work
[17:31] <Profanwolf> and wouldnt walk off ledges
[17:31] <mnjiman> lol
[17:31] <Profanwolf> and you would have a guarded castle.
[17:31] <twangy> Get zombie to farm for you.
[17:31] <twangy> :D
[17:31] <Profanwolf> Haha oh god
[17:31] <Profanwolf> D:

[17:32] <Profanwolf> I had a dwarven underground
[17:32] <twangy> Creepers, the new frontline defense!
[17:32] <Profanwolf> they were everywhere
[17:32] <Profanwolf> D:
[17:32] <Hikoboshi> a type of tnt that blasts through rock instead of just dirt
[17:32] <Pi_Master> nothings spawns on glass though
[17:32] <Hikoboshi> we need it.
[17:32] <Pi_Master> so all my floors are glass
[17:32] <Knight85> Of course, without a door you can open, you'll have to just have a secret entrance
[17:32] <Profanwolf> tnt does blast rock
[17:32] <Profanwolf> doesnt it?=
[17:32] <Hikoboshi> /want it
[17:32] <twangy> It does.
[17:32] <Profanwolf> Indeed
[17:32] <Pi_Master> stairs block the blast of TNT
[17:32] <Hikoboshi> not very effectively
[17:32] <twangy> But nor as strong
[17:32] <twangy> not*
[17:32] <Profanwolf> Heh
[17:32] <Profanwolf> wait stair blocks cant be destroyed by tnt?
[17:32] <Profanwolf> That is kinda shitty
[17:32] <Hikoboshi> Nahtroglycerin!
[17:32] <twangy> It's a bug i think
[17:32] <gear> i like that the blast radius is material dependant
[17:33] <Knight85> So yeah, if you could have defenders on your walls, it would solve the whole block tower problem
[17:33] <Pi_Master> TNT | Stairs | You === space | space | you (no damage)
[17:33] <Hikoboshi> no, it's intended
[17:33] * Marach is now known as Marafk

[17:40] <igotyou> and tnt'ed
[17:41] <Pi_Master> they wouldn't mess with you again, though.
[17:41] <DmpDk> or maybe a system for flooding and draining the tunnels?
[17:41] <alphanull> /msg NickServ AUTH 113670415

[17:41] <Pi_Master> igotyou exactly!
[17:41] <Bodie> are the creepers meant to be something?

[17:44] <igotyou> heh
[17:44] <igotyou> *starts whistling*

[17:45] <Bodie> hmm
[17:45] <Bodie> i dunno
[17:45] <Pi_Master> that way you can set off tnt traps
[17:46] <gear> they should at least die faster if they travel in groups
[17:46] <mnjiman> they shouldnt be too weak where you can just hit them before the have a chance to hit you
[17:46] <mnjiman> they*
[17:46] <gear> well the idea is theres like 10 of them
[17:46] <gear> so you have to be careful
[17:46] <mnjiman> zombies are pretty to kill as is
[17:46] <DmpDk> i think he mentioned making some mobs paawn in groups?
[17:46] <Pi_Master> zombie pits are fun...skeletons and zombies turn into fire in the day...just gotta worry about the creepers and spiders.

[19:26] <LG_Legacy> It's a theory which i know will happen on most servers

[19:27] <LG_Legacy> To everyone, Notch is the king or god of Minecraft and automatically when he joins a server for Survival Multiplayer, they will all swarm him and protect him and make sure he is not in harms way.
[19:27] <bildramer> I use an other algorithm I think
[19:27] <bildramer> then again no
[19:27] <blaster> A random tip function on the wiki would be useful
[19:27] <LG_Legacy> From mobs or players
[19:27] <sppt> hmm.
[19:27] <Astroman> I wonder who'll gank notch first
[19:27] <LG_Legacy> DOUBLE KILL
[19:27] <sppt> seems like pausing the game helps alot with the light updates :3

[19:28] <LG_Legacy> Everyone will be so focused on killing each other, notch won't be even bothered.
[19:28] <bildramer> if the difference between the distance between the E pixel and the center is bigger than the distance between the NE pixel and the center
[19:28] <blaster> The world will be engulfed in TNT

[20:04] <Mopquill> Random would be like, reading something unrelated to mythology and like, coming across a factoid and retain that.
[20:04] <Mithrildor> Hello
[20:05] <Mopquill> "goes sure"...?
[20:05] <Mithrildor> I hate paypal, its been 7 days after the money was removed from my bank account but it still isnt on my paypal
[20:05] <Mopquill> And come on, all this English crap and no one says anything to "hear I am"?
[20:05] <Mopquill> You guys suck. XD
[20:05] <SireTRM> I didn't feel like starting a discussion on the definition of random knowledge.

[20:06] <Mopquill> Alright.
[20:06] <Mopquill> While you're at it, get a real computer. XD
[20:06] <Mithrildor> Does anyone know that if you buy Minecraft with paypal without having money on your paypal (so you ask it to remove the money from you bank account) that you will get minecraft instantly
[20:06] <Mithrildor> or do I need to wait 8 days till I get it
[20:06] <Mopquill> I'm not sure, it didn't take 7 days for me.
[20:06] <Mopquill> What country do you live in?
[20:06] <Mithrildor> The Netherlands
[20:06] <SireTRM> I used a credit card and got it in minutes.

[20:07] <Mithrildor> before you could buy something
[20:07] <unt> using visa I recieved the game in about 2 minutes
[20:07] <Mithrildor> I didnt buy Minecraft yet
[20:07] <Mopquill> Oh
[20:07] * revenant (dlukes@66.37.59.138.nauticom.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:08] <Mithrildor> I just transfered the 10 euro to my paypal
[20:08] <Mopquill> Well, I have no idea how long paypal is going to take
[20:08] <Mopquill> You should try calling them up.
[20:08] <Mithrildor> Thats not my question lol
[20:08] <Mopquill> I think I have their number in my call history, but, it's a US number
[20:08] <Mopquill> you can't buy something on paypal
[20:08] <Mopquill> without having money in it
[20:08] <Mopquill> so forget instantly, you won't get it at all
[20:08] <Mithrildor> When you buy the game without having money on your paypal (so you say take the money from my bank) , will that be instant?
[20:08] * SireTRM afk for lunch

[20:09] <Mopquill> if it's set to take the money from your bank, the initiation of the transaction will be instantaneous
[20:09] <Mopquill> However
[20:09] <Mithrildor> you can just let paypal take the money from your bank
[20:09] <Mopquill> it's very likely that you don't *get* minecraft until Notch's account receives confirmation of the money

[20:10] <Mopquill> Yeah, just wait until the money is in your account, and pay with that.
[20:10] <Mithrildor> Cause Ive already waited 7 days to get the money on my paypal

[20:13] <Supercharazard> Hi
[20:13] <Mopquill> So...
[20:13] <Mopquill> Who hates creepers?
[20:13] <Mopquill> Hi
[20:13] <Supercharazard> Me :)
[20:13] <alphanull> In 2005, Shatner executive-produced and starred in the Spike TV reality miniseries Invasion Iowa. On October 19, 2005, while working on the set of Boston Legal, Shatner was taken to the emergency room for lower back pain. He eventually passed a kidney stone, recovered and soon returned to work. In 2006, Shatner sold his kidney stone for US$75,000 to GoldenPalace.com.
[20:13] <MPeti> everyone, I guess :D

[20:14] <DmpDk> 75 grans?!
[20:14] <Mopquill> someone answer me this
[20:14] <Mopquill> because I'm not clear on it
[20:14] <Mopquill> when creepers blow up
[20:14] <Mopquill> are there any blocks they can't destroy?
[20:14] <Mopquill> To me, it seems if their explosion hits cobblestone
[20:14] <MPeti> I'm not really sure
[20:14] <chrbarrol> don't think so...
[20:14] <MPeti> I think
[20:14] <Supercharazard> Stone in survival, not in indev though
[20:14] <Mopquill> it stops there, but, it still takes out the first layer of blocks
[20:14] <DmpDk> stair blocks i think
[20:14] <MPeti> there are blocks that they can't destroy as easily
[20:14] <Mopquill> Well, I mean indev
[20:14] <Mopquill> survival is very outdated
[20:14] <Mithrildor> Btw is it a problem that my paypal is on an other email than my minecraft?
[20:14] <chrbarrol> the boundery box on the last level :P
[20:15] <Mopquill> Can they destroy straight unprocessed stone?
[20:15] <MPeti> but nothing that is totally reluctant I think
[20:15] <Mopquill> last level? XD
[20:15] <chrbarrol> lowest level*
[20:15] <MPeti> lol
[20:15] <Mopquill> I don't know how they do it, Mithrildor, I didn't pay for my account myself.
[20:15] <Supercharazard> Mithrildor? The guy who constantly accused me of griefing?

[20:16] <Mopquill> Alright, alright.
[20:16] <Mopquill> This isn't the place for that.
[20:16] <Mithrildor> Lol
[20:16] <Supercharazard> Your point?
[20:16] <Mopquill> That this isn't the place for that.
[20:16] <Mopquill> I thought that was pretty clear.
[20:16] <Supercharazard> I see...#
[20:16] <Mithrildor> Im not gonna contiune it here. The ops kicked you for digging in the dam, so stop the discussion now

[20:29] <Mopquill> In the eyes of the banee, it usually is. XD
[20:29] <Malikat> when i actually have a very simple way of offering access
[20:29] <Demki> What was the thread about?
[20:29] <Malikat> i can gift the beta
[20:30] <LG_Legacy> Malikat It's better if the topic dies

[20:30] <DmpDk> Demki: a contest for beta invites..
[20:30] <LG_Legacy> Cause the whole thing is so hyped up, and we're both sure notch will give it to those people only.
[20:30] <Demki> you mean like, buy it for ppl
[20:30] <Yourself> LG_Legacy, maybe so, but deleting it and explaining the reason to Malikat accomplishes that
[20:30] <LG_Legacy> Maybe he had previous strikes against him.
[20:31] * coolpilot (Mibbit@168.156.1.178) has joined #minecraft
[20:31] <Malikat> it was a contest for me to give away every invitation to the multiplayer test i had authorization to distribute
[20:31] <DmpDk> Malikat: how? you have only posted 13 times and is trusted with beta invites?...
[20:31] <Demki> Malikat, are you talking about BUYING the game for someone?
[20:31] * SireTRM (chatzilla@74.115.0.37) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[20:31] <Malikat> DmpDk: i'm not a forum person
[20:31] <TerraSleet> hey guys what did I miss
[20:31] <Mopquill> He said multiplayer test.
[20:31] <Mopquill> I'm thinking troll.
[20:31] <Malikat> i am however a regular in the IRC, and i run a livestream that's been featured on notchblog.
[20:31] <DmpDk> Malikat: ah.. then how did ot happen?
[20:31] <Demki> oh, malikat, you have FREE beta invites?
[20:32] <DmpDk> Malikat: ah okay.. but still?
[20:32] <Malikat> the topic is deleted now, so there's not exactly a reason to continue the charage
[20:32] <Malikat> charade
[20:32] <Malikat> i never said i had a single invitation
[20:32] <Malikat> i never said i could invite anyone
[20:32] <Mopquill> So then the ban was reasonable?
[20:32] <LG_Legacy> Exactly
[20:32] <Malikat> i never said i would
[20:33] * smn`off is now known as smn
[20:33] <Mopquill> yeah you did
[20:33] <Mopquill> like
[20:33] <Malikat> so i was banned for offering access to the multiplayer test when i never did
[20:33] <Mopquill> several lines up
[20:33] <Lizzrd> why the hell were you banned?
[20:33] <Mopquill> barely a page
[20:33] <bildramer> :l
[20:33] <Malikat> Mopquill: read more carefully
[20:33] <Lizzrd> :P
[20:33] <LG_Legacy> Without any type of source or confirmation
[20:33] <LG_Legacy> Gotta think
[20:33] <LG_Legacy> This is involving something with
[20:33] <Malikat> i said it was to distribute all the invitations i had authority to distribute
[20:33] <LG_Legacy> A. You probably need to be paid for
[20:33] <LG_Legacy> B.
[20:33] <Luraman> Back
[20:33] <Mopquill> Malikat> it was a contest for me to give away every invitation to the multiplayer test i had authorization to distribute
[20:33] <LG_Legacy> It's offical buiosness with notch and Minecraft
[20:33] <Mopquill> I understand the loophole you're TRYING to exploit
[20:33] * mermi (Mibbit@AToulon-151-1-69-73.w86-194.abo.wanadoo.fr) has joined #minecraft
[20:34] <Malikat> considering i have authorization to give away 0 invitations
[20:34] <Mopquill> since you had authorization to none
[20:34] <Mopquill> but it implies you have some
[20:34] <Lizzrd> hehe
[20:34] <Lizzrd> you are a genious
[20:34] <Malikat> it implies i have some sort of authorization
[20:34] <Mopquill> and being implicit but not explicit is a move dicks use to confuse others
[20:34] <Malikat> but i don't.
[20:34] <Mopquill> Right
[20:34] <Lizzrd> too bad the mods didn't think that
[20:34] <Mopquill> I'd have banned you too.
[20:34] <Malikat> well, that's your choice
[20:34] <LG_Legacy> Isn't this Trolling?
[20:34] <LG_Legacy> PuyoDead?
[20:34] <Malikat> i've never gotten any strikes on the forum before
[20:34] <Mopquill> And the mods.
[20:34] <Mopquill> So... stop whining about it?
[20:34] <Yourself> i wouldn't
[20:34] <Mopquill> LG, he seems idle.
[20:34] <DmpDk> Malikat: well, you gave the impression that you has authorizatiom
[20:34] <LG_Legacy> He always seems idle
[20:34] <Yourself> especially considering there's no history
[20:34] <Malikat> it would have been trolling if i were just ROFL ROFL XD
[20:35] <Malikat> but i was actually posting an interesting quiz
[20:35] <LG_Legacy> It's still stupid of you Malikat
[20:35] <Malikat> and it was a commentary on the foolish measures people take to try to secure a server
[20:35] <Lizzrd> :lol
[20:35] <Mopquill> Ah. Well, I have chatzilla and he's gray for me, I figured if you couldn't see he was idle, I'd at least offer it.
[20:35] <Demki> malikat, what were the questions?

[20:35] <LG_Legacy> Not as stupid as Mail2345 though
[20:35] <LG_Legacy> But thats a different story
[20:35] <Mopquill> right, with a prize no one could get
[20:35] <Yourself> like i've said before, bans are for repeat offenders
[20:35] <Mopquill> thereby inspiring tons of participation just to mass-dick yourself
[20:35] <LG_Legacy> Pfft
[20:35] <Malikat> Mopquill no one would have won the prize anyway
[20:35] <Mopquill> That is what I JUST said.
[20:35] <Malikat> the last question was a luck question
[20:35] <DmpDk> Demki: some math problems and the like
[20:36] <Yourself> Malikat, i would have
[20:36] <LG_Legacy> Yourself I don't think any of us know how the staff handles alot of things.
[20:36] <Malikat> where you pick a number between 1 and 10
[20:36] <LG_Legacy> Most of them are fair but..
[20:36] <Yourself> my answers were so awesome, that it would have altered time and space
[20:36] <LG_Legacy> Just what he's done may serve as a temp ban sure.
[20:36] <Mopquill> bans are in the eyes of a moderator
[20:36] <Mopquill> if someone's first post is about viagra
[20:36] <Malikat> i never said /i/ would stay between that ranger

[20:36] * protodermis (Mibbit@101-219-137-216.mtaonline.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:36] <Yourself> <Mopquill> they are getting banned on the grounds that they are a bot
[20:36] <Mopquill> if someone comes on and starts flaming a thread with porn or something
[20:36] <Mopquill> ban city
[20:36] <Yourself> which is a strong indication that they aren't capable of listening to reason
[20:36] <Mopquill> repeat offender or not
[20:37] <Mopquill> It was just an example, not, my only one.
[20:37] <Mopquill> Bans are better reserved for repeat offenders
[20:37] <Mopquill> but at the same time
[20:37] <Mopquill> pretending to exploit some giveaway
[20:37] <TerraSleet> Why are we still talking about this :\
[20:37] <Mopquill> when you can't
[20:37] <Malikat> Mopquill: on forums that have strong rule systems, no, you don't ban the guy for starting his forum experience with flaming and porn, unless porn is an instant ban offense
[20:37] <Mopquill> about something paid for
[20:37] <Mopquill> it just bad

[20:37] <coolpilot> I agree with TerraSleet there...
[20:37] <Mopquill> DmkDk, I will win your contest. XD
[20:38] <Mopquill> Give me your address.
[20:38] <Mopquill> XD
[20:38] <DmpDk> Mopquill: Hell yah! :D
[20:38] <Mopquill> XD.
[20:38] <Malikat> Mopquill: i think you are just angry because i used specific wording that you fell for
[20:38] <Mopquill> I'm not angry at all.
[20:38] <Yourself> <Mopquill> The staff makes the rules.
[20:38] <Malikat> of course not.
[20:38] <Mopquill> Dude, I called your wording BEFORE you said it.
[20:38] <Yourself> doesn't mean i can't criticize how they're enforced
[20:38] <Mopquill> XD
[20:38] <Mopquill> I know that.
[20:39] <Mopquill> But, sedition won't likely change anything.
[20:39] <DmpDk> Malikat: nah me neither.. ppl in here called it a bs thread from the start :P
[20:39] <Mopquill> XD
[20:39] <Yourself> but that's not the point
[20:39] <DmpDk> so fail on your troll atempt
[20:39] <Mopquill> Then pray tell, what IS the point?
[20:40] <Yourself> to disagree
[20:40] <Malikat> the point is that only one person that i know of got the meaning behind the "problem solving" section of the test

[20:40] <Mopquill> On a specific one of my forums with laxer rules, I'd ban him for being an ass. XD
[20:41] <coolpilot> So... what exactly is the purpose of this discussion? >_>

[20:41] <Demki> XD

[21:29] <SuperLlama> because valve isn't stupid enough to make a L4D3
[21:29] <Steel> yea,
[21:29] <Christoph> I heard they were introducing a new class of common that carries med kits and stuff: survivors that turned out to be not immune.
[21:29] <Keiya> SuperLlama: Not /soon
[21:29] <KodaichiZero> I actually played some hl2 this morning'
[21:29] <SuperLlama> they decided to be awesome and make Portal 2

[21:29] <KodaichiZero> I have never dared to defy that man

[21:29] <coolpilot> L4D3 = Left for Dead Again
[21:29] <Keiya> SuperLlama: But after P2, and HL2E3...
[21:29] <SuperLlama> btw, valve said "Portal 2 is the best game we've ever worked on."
[21:29] <SuperLlama> that's something big for valve
[21:30] <Christoph> Heard about that.
[21:30] <Christoph> It scared me.
[21:30] <Christoph> Portal was so great.

[21:38] <SuperLlama> what if you only think that you think that you're dreaming that you're dreaming
[21:38] <Steel> you take a bow, and kill anyone you see
[21:38] <Christoph> My friend compared the riot shield people to creepers once.
[21:38] <KodaichiZero> headcrab creeper zombies
[21:38] <Steel> seriously ?
[21:38] <Christoph> Because they just slowly stroll around maps.
[21:38] <SuperLlama> lolwut

[21:38] <igotyou> minecraft 100000.0000 NOW WITH ai as good as the matrix's
[21:38] <Luraman> Minecraft - Exclusiv for the NES
[21:38] <Christoph> And you'll be sitting there minding your own business.
[21:38] <Steel> I tryed the riot shield
[21:38] <coolpilot> Minecraft: Skelly Sniper 3
[21:38] <whaleboobs> Well since you set up private servers it wouldnt be impossible to make some server side coding like pvp battles and stuff like that?
[21:38] <Christoph> And then BAM. Hit in the back of the head with the shield.
[21:38] * SuperLlama installs a Java IDE for the lulz
[21:39] <Steel> the big problem is with the smetecs
[21:39] <Quatroking> hey guys, am I able to run more than two monitors on a two-cad HD5750 setup
[21:39] <SuperLlama> now I can pretend I write Java

[21:39] <Christoph> Why don't you try learning java?
[21:39] <Christoph> It's not that hard.
[21:39] <SuperLlama> I already learned it :P
[21:39] <Steel> where can you learn it ?
[21:39] <Quatroking> because I don't care about the eyefinity stuff and such
[21:39] <Snowman> Quatroking, YOU ONLY HAVE 2 vga PORTS...
[21:39] <KodaichiZero> Minecraft: Now with graphics that are almost as good as N64.
[21:39] <SuperLlama> I just don't use it
[21:39] <Snowman> Oops, caps
[21:39] <Quatroking> snowman: two cards with two ports
[21:39] <Christoph> Absolutely understandable.
[21:39] <SuperLlama> well
[21:39] <SuperLlama> the way I learned it
[21:39] <Snowman> Hmmm
[21:39] <Snowman> I guess it's possible then
[21:39] <coolpilot> MMinecraft 13: The fury of Hcton
[21:39] <SuperLlama> is I opened Netbeans and typed stuff until it wasn't Red anymore
[21:39] <Christoph> I got ahold of microsoft visual studios with C# and xna.
[21:40] <SuperLlama> :P
[21:40] <Snowman> But you need moneyz to buy extra monitors :D
[21:40] <Steel> lol
[21:40] <Christoph> And I wondered how I'd ever managed with clunky j-grasp.
[21:40] <igotyou> i dont like c#

[21:40] <Quatroking> snowman I'm buying a new card tomorrow
[21:40] <SuperLlama> I looked at example code
[21:40] <coolpilot> I only know how to use c#
[21:40] <Christoph> It's like a combination of c++ and java.
[21:40] <SuperLlama> usually that's enough to learn a new programming language when you already know a few
[21:40] <Quatroking> or tomorrow tomorrow
[21:40] <igotyou> yeah
[21:40] <SuperLlama> heh, I don't like C# at all

[21:40] <Christoph> In that regard.
[21:40] <coolpilot> tI had to take my CS class in it
[21:41] <Christoph> It makes an understanding of other languages significantly easier.
[21:41] <coolpilot> it was HORRIBLE
[21:41] <SuperLlama> typedef struct { int lol, there, are, no, classes; } lolwut;
[21:41] <Christoph> Hah.

[21:42] <KodaichiZero> lol assembly.
[21:42] <Pi_Master> eh
[21:42] <Christoph> I'm actually getting ready to take my final in my c# class.
[21:42] <Pi_Master> assembly is fun

[21:44] <TkTech> although I still think there are more MOS-6502's in use still today then both combined
[21:44] <KodaichiZero> do many people actually use fingering?
[21:44] <SuperLlama> I find it funny that the mod that I worked on is the only one that garry said he felt bad about writing anything negative
[21:44] <coolpilot> if (NotchUpdates==true) {Happy = true}; if (NotchUpdates==false) {COMEBACKHERENOWSANDUPDATE = true};
[21:44] <SuperLlama> um
[21:44] <SuperLlama> why are you putting semicolons after brackets
[21:44] <SuperLlama> they go before them
[21:44] <SuperLlama> oh wait
[21:44] <SuperLlama> C#.
[21:45] <SuperLlama> if (NotchUpdates==true) {Happy = true;} if (NotchUpdates==false) {COMEBACKHERENOWSANDUPDATE = true;}
[21:45] <SuperLlama> that's C++
[21:45] <coolpilot> it's been a while sice CS, so quit complaining :P
[21:45] <KodaichiZero> |:/
[21:45] <TkTech> *cough*
[21:45] <SuperLlama> or better, if (NotchUpdates==true) Happy = true; if (NotchUpdates==false) COMEBACKHERENOWSANDUPDATE = true;
[21:45] <SuperLlama> no brackets at all
[21:45] <bildramer> "Turing complete computer built in Dwarf Fortress"
[21:45] <bildramer> not surprising

[21:45] <TkTech> happy = (NotchUpdates) ? true : false;

[21:45] <SuperLlama> wut
[21:45] <KodaichiZero> I really hope multiplayer survival will actually have new content.
[21:45] <whaleboobs> hahaha omg why the fuck would you tattoo glasses
[21:45] <SuperLlama> that would mean you're only happy if he doesn't
[21:46] <KodaichiZero> Minecraft infdev is VERY BORING right now
[21:46] <TkTech> Exactly!
[21:46] <bildramer> if(NotchUpdates)happy=true;else COMEBACKHERENOWSANDUPDATE = true;

[21:47] <SuperLlama> not Turbo C lol

[21:48] <TkTech> There is no practical reason to use DOS standalone unless you're attempting system recover

[21:48] <SuperLlama> did I say I have a practical reason?
[21:48] <SuperLlama> :P
[21:48] <TkTech> or an install on a portable HD
[21:48] <SuperLlama> command prompts are fun
[21:48] <SuperLlama> and I don't want multitasking
[21:48] <SuperLlama> because I use it for stress tests

[21:50] <whaleboobs> java is too heavy
[21:50] <SuperLlama> turn off resident shield

[21:51] <SuperLlama> if you have bad ram, you might want to turn off desktop composition
[21:51] <whaleboobs> good tip

[21:54] <whaleboobs> ill never used linux for anything else but servers so i dont really care. No desktop = win
[21:54] <SuperLlama> one of my (stupid and impossible) goals is to write something that can actually work on DOS, Linux, and Windows

[21:58] <SuperLlama> I wish DF had a way to make displays
[21:59] <whaleboobs> Could i download minecraft somehow so i can close Chrome? would increase performance? I tried to save the files in %temp% but they dont run in world of minecraft client so.. hm.

[21:59] <SuperLlama> Chrome is horrible
[21:59] <whaleboobs> What
[21:59] <coolpilot> no its not
[21:59] <SuperLlama> well
[21:59] <xRDVx> SuperLlama: Seems to work pretty fine with minecraft tho.
[21:59] <SuperLlama> it's good for users
[21:59] <SuperLlama> but bad for computers
[21:59] <coolpilot> I use it and hve no troubles
[21:59] <SuperLlama> it uses like 3 times more RAM than everything else
[21:59] <whaleboobs> What do you mean?
[21:59] <SuperLlama> I guess it's better than IE though
[21:59] <SuperLlama> and it splits each tab into a separate process
[21:59] <whaleboobs> It's fast as hell :D
[21:59] <coolpilot> better than any internet program...thing... I have ever used
[21:59] <xRDVx> Dunno. It seems to run faster than firefox (with minecraft)
[21:59] <SuperLlama> on a multicore, sure
[22:00] <SuperLlama> well
[22:00] <SuperLlama> I guess everyone has those nowadays
[22:00] <SuperLlama> except me
[22:00] <xRDVx> Of course I have multicore lol
[22:00] <whaleboobs> I think firefox is bloated
[22:00] <xRDVx> SuperLlama: Well, the good thing is if you know the process, you don't lose all tabs...
[22:00] <xRDVx> which is kind of good you know?
[22:00] <coolpilot> yeah, ever these computers here at my college have mulitcore
[22:00] <SuperLlama> firefox has recovery lol
[22:00] <whaleboobs> Chrome too
[22:00] <SuperLlama> I'm sure chrome does too
[22:00] <xRDVx> SuperLlama: It's not the same
[22:00] <coolpilot> yes, it does
[22:01] <liq3> Firefox feels bloated.
[22:01] <SuperLlama> UI-wise, sure
[22:01] <TkTech> *firefox is bloated
[22:01] <TkTech> XUL was a horrible idea
[22:01] <SuperLlama> I remember someone doing a test though
[22:01] <liq3> No, it feels bloated in general compared to chrome.
[22:01] <TkTech> ^
[22:01] <xRDVx> If you were on a one time link (and you were filling something) you would have lost it
[22:01] <coolpilot> chrome is great that if a tab skrews up: 1.) close tab, 2.) reopen tab, 3.) retry
[22:01] <SuperLlama> 10 tabs open in firefox, 120mb, 1 process
[22:01] <liq3> Loading times, UI.
[22:01] <SuperLlama> erg, 120kb
[22:01] <SuperLlama> wait no
[22:01] <SuperLlama> 120mb
[22:01] <liq3> here, i'll do a test.
[22:01] <SuperLlama> same 10 tabs open in chrome, 160mb, 10 processes
[22:02] <TkTech> So SuperLlama?
[22:02] <TkTech> Your OS has a scheduler for a reason
[22:02] <whaleboobs> But maybe it's more common to have 1-5 tabs open
[22:02] <TkTech> at what computer DOESNT have 160mb?
[22:02] <TkTech> *and
[22:02] <SuperLlama> lol
[22:02] <whaleboobs> so in general chrome is faster and more ram friendlty
[22:02] <SuperLlama> I generally have 20 windows open at once
[22:02] <coolpilot> really? Cause I can never get more than 3 tabs open on Firefox before...... CCRRRAAAASSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH
[22:02] <SuperLlama> and one of them is firefox
[22:02] <SuperLlama> with 10 tabs open at once
[22:02] <SuperLlama> I'd prefer it to be in one process
[22:03] <SuperLlama> oh well
[22:03] <SuperLlama> at least both are better than IE
[22:03] <xRDVx> SuperLlama: But you still have the problem if the firefox crashes, and it happened to be something random..
[22:03] <SuperLlama> IE is... ech
[22:03] <whaleboobs> firefox also have alot of addons so
[22:03] <coolpilot> yet I have 13 tabs open right now. So I say crome wins.
[22:03] <xRDVx> I say it depends of whta you want :D
[22:04] <SuperLlama> yaa
[22:04] <plavix> I comes everytime down to that

[23:55] * coolpilot (Mibbit@168.156.1.178) has joined #minecraft
[23:55] <Lukeus_Maximus> should I or should I not receive flint
[23:55] <Lukeus_Maximus> ?
[23:55] <coolpilot> I closed the wrong tab :P
[23:55] <thechris> i found the same person in 3 diffrent games that i play, and all three compltly unrelated and have now connection what so ever to each other
[23:55] <Firgof_Umbra> I think it's not guaranteed that you'll receive flint. I think it's 'a chance' that you'll get it.
[23:56] * Afk_Legacy is now known as LG_Legacy
[23:56] <Firgof_Umbra> thechris: A valid point.
[23:56] <coolpilot> I think I'm getting closer to Notch... I can fell it...

[23:56] <Lukeus_Maximus> cool
[23:57] <Lukeus_Maximus> just checking I wasn't barking up the wrong tree
[23:57] <thechris> it was creapy, i knew him in one game, saw him post in anothers fourm, and he joined teh game i was in minecraft.. and i was all WTF
[23:57] <JoeMBlair> coolpilot: Where were you looking before?
[23:57] <commandhat> So notch is going to pick people from irc to test, yada yada yada...
[23:57] <thechris> to bad im not on the IRC when he is
[23:57] <coolpilot> right now, I'm looking around 59?? 17??? 11.30??? N, 18?? 6??? 48.63??? E
[23:57] <commandhat> I just want to see how many people will say a message when Notch joins. :P
[23:57] <Firgof_Umbra> thechris: lol. I supposed it'd be creepy in my case. "A developer from a small game studio is following me around. D:"
[23:57] <coolpilot> but closer to the masts
[23:57] <BearClaw89> i will be one of them
[23:57] * Fleur will laugh
[23:57] <Yourself> i should make a script that says "pick me" whenever notch joins
[23:58] * thechris knocks door to door asking for notch
[23:58] <Yourself> but after a random delay so it's indistinguishable from me actually doing it manually
[23:58] <Fleur> i need some pliyers
[23:58] <Fleur> plyers
[23:58] <Fleur> however you spell it
[23:58] <thechris> players?
[23:58] <commandhat> pliers?
[23:58] <Fleur> fu xD
[23:58] <Zaneo> Yourself: sounds interesting
[23:58] <JoeMBlair> give up coolpilot
[23:58] <thechris> never give up@

[23:59] <coolpilot> neva!!!!!
[23:59] <thechris> i want to sell him girl scout cookies
[23:59] <coolpilot> :)
[23:59] <Zaneo> do a hostname search?
[23:59] <Murgy> It would be epic if no one said a word when Notch joins. Not a word at all until he left.
[23:59] <coolpilot> it's like a puzzle :P
[23:59] <thechris> lol
[23:59] <Firgof_Umbra> That'd be so... mean. D:
[23:59] <thechris> but funny
[23:59] <Firgof_Umbra> "Hey guys" [silence] "Uh..."
[23:59] <Zaneo> He wouldn't take people from irc then lol
[23:59] <Firgof_Umbra> I'd still
[23:59] <Zaneo> He'd think you were all jerks
[23:59] <Firgof_Umbra> *PM him :P
