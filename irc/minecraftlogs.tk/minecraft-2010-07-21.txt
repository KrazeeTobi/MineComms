[11:49] <LG_Legacy> Ask notch

[11:50] <Azathoth> custom servers means custom server software, not servers you are hosting yourself (with the official server)
[11:50] <LG_Legacy> Again wisp query
[11:50] <Quatroking> Ecthel, because if you use any of this custom third party minecraft stuff, you're a sinner.

[11:50] <Rizyq> Dangit, my pokemon had 3 HP and killed itself in confusion D:
[11:50] <LG_Legacy> All custom server talk is banned, this is the official VANILLA minecraft irc channel.

[11:53] <Dragoon> I've been boating
[11:53] <Tukiko> Dragoon: Also you need to make sure that you're in land that has been generated since the cactus update.
[11:53] <CyberXZT> assuming it works on linux at start...
[11:53] <Ecthel> my computer would explode if I tried to run an SMP server

[11:55] <Quatroking> oh wait, irc client
[11:55] <Quatroking> nevermind
[11:55] <Ecthel> also if everyone hates WoM, why does Notch link to it on the community page? I've never figured that out.

[12:18] <Quatroking> gives criminals a chance to escape huh

[12:21] <Kitoari> I recall one case where a man was convicted, even though the dna was someone else's.
[12:21] <Deepa> Soviet: there was a gang of girls who raped a man with a chair
[12:22] <Siiseli> Quatroking, cos' girls don't need to rape
[12:22] <Kitoari> ... I'd rather not know.
[12:22] <Quatroking> sorre: and there are always those feminists
[12:22] * Halfblood is now known as haxelnut
[12:22] <Kitoari> how they did that.
[12:22] <Siiseli> they can just go "yo I want sex"
[12:22] <Quatroking> "give us better positions"
[12:22] <sorre> right
[12:22] <sorre> some activists don't want to be equal
[12:22] <sorre> they want special rights
[12:22] <Rac> ...With a chair?
[12:22] <sorre> which defeats the entire point
[12:22] <Quatroking> but do those people ever actually take the required education for those positions
[12:22] <Quatroking> lol no

[12:43] <sorre> they interpreted my troublemaking as a symptom of ADD, and medicated me for six years, despite my insistence that it made me perpetually ill
[12:43] <Cial> flying Italian dish SumWon ?
[12:43] <sorre> i can see nothing short of malice in these actions
[12:44] <sorre> especially in the continuance thereof
[12:44] <SumWon> I think your mind has warped your memory.
[12:44] <Kitoari> let's shift to a very similar, but even stupider story involving me
[12:44] <Cial> sorre, no one listens to kids
[12:44] <Kitoari> My great grandfather is an amazing man
[12:44] <Kitoari> he fought in 2 wars for our country
[12:44] <SumWon> Oh fun
[12:44] <NMLittle> And when you say "THEY" medicated you, I assume you are talking about the medical doctor who had to write your prescription.
[12:45] <Kitoari> and he was ready to live quietly in the country with his wife, my great-grandmother
[12:45] <sorre> they chose the doctor i saw
[12:45] <SumWon> [11:43:36] <sllide> perkamentus died :(
[12:45] <SumWon> Reading harry potter?
[12:45] <Kitoari> unsurprisingly, he eventually got sick
[12:45] <sorre> and they called him before i even saw him for the first time, and told him that i had ADD, and needed medication
[12:45] <tj505050> hi notch

[12:52] <Kitoari> About a month later, he was sent back due to pnumonia [sp]. They lied to us about there being no room in ICU, which is where he needed to go. They were giving him protein while his kidneys were failing. They said he had full organ failure (he didn't).
[12:52] <Drury> Notch still here?
[12:52] <Soviet> 40% accurate over 40 blocks, 80% survive 25 blocks , Notch surely put some randomness into accuracy
[12:52] <PadroJeremy> wb Tuk
[12:52] <C418> flood means the same stuff about ten times, which was not the case...
[12:52] <C418> alright
[12:52] <C418> have found the problem
[12:52] <Kitoari> They lied to us about 90% of the time.
[12:52] <Actown> was it just lines in a row?
[12:52] <C418> it only kicks someone when it finds 5 times the same line now. sorry Kitoari
[12:52] <Kitoari> np
[12:53] <Kitoari> They weren't giving him his medication which made him delusional.
[12:53] <C418> and nick change floods
[12:53] <Kitoari> It was awful. Also, did I mention they didn't have him on ANY NUTRIENTS for a while?

[13:12] <Actown> Quatroking: we all have different reasons to use different kinds of software :)
[13:12] <vurtual> or 4 letters and one language

[14:24] <ouT|Phaze> JoesephJoestar: my "bottom" was 100+ blocks below where I first started seeing bedrock

[14:24] <Actown> screenshot it
[14:24] <ouT|Phaze> screenshot the bottom?
[14:24] <JoesephJoestar> I haven't reached the bottom yet. I'm paranoid of going that deep.
[14:24] <Actown> im interested it the bottom of the world
[14:24] <ouT|Phaze> doesn't everyone... oh
[14:24] <ouT|Phaze> ok
[14:24] <Link2006> What happens when you fall in the void?
[14:24] <Poikachoika> hmm
[14:24] <Actown> JoesephJoestar: ideally you cant dig past the bedrock
[14:24] <Link2006> Cause i dug so deep to reach it
[14:25] <Link2006> yet
[14:25] <Poikachoika> there aren't really as many people as i expected lol
[14:25] <Rivet> you die and cant get back your stuff.

[14:25] <nupanick> oh man you know what I always do
[14:25] <Darkie> apparently a new starcraft 2 trailer just came out
[14:25] <nupanick> when I make towers
[14:26] <ouT|Phaze> Actown: I'm talking about during beta and pre-release
[14:26] <Darkie> and it made me jizz in my pants
[14:26] <ouT|Phaze> Actown: MMO channels during that time are usually super active

[14:26] <Darkie> lookie
[14:26] <Actown> ouT|Phaze: then usually they dont have a offical irc channel
[14:26] <nupanick> I dig a shaft down
[14:26] <ouT|Phaze> Actown: which is why I made the comparison
[14:26] <Rivet> I saw the new starcraft trailer on TV

[14:27] <SSC> the notch is a lie
[14:27] <Poikachoika> put torches everywhere nupanick

[14:27] <Actown> or asleep
[14:27] <mib_8la1d5> kinda wanna just go into a coma till multiplayer
[14:27] <nupanick> what is the purpose of torchspamming
[14:27] <mib_8la1d5> and wake up after its out
[14:27] <SSC> he only work, play games and eat something
[14:28] <Poikachoika> nupanick: so enemies don't spawn in your house
[14:28] <Kitoari> nupanick: use too many torches, to the point of wastefulness
[14:28] <Rivet> like hotdogs

[14:28] <nupanick> ah
[14:28] <ouT|Phaze> for whoever wanted a pic of the bottom
[14:28] <nupanick> I do that by accident sometimes
[14:28] <nupanick> but then pigs spawn in my underground garden
[14:28] <nupanick> and trample all my crops
[14:28] <Actown> ouT|Phaze: it must be night out lol
[14:28] <nupanick> so I try not to over-torch those areas.

[14:29] <nupanick> I always start by building a tower, right?
[14:30] <Poikachoika> i /know/ i won't be picked
[14:30] <Poikachoika> but that doesn't mean i can't talk to you guys
[14:30] <Kodaichi> Jabjabjab, I have to eat dinner now bye
[14:30] <Kitoari> I come in here to discuss what I'm currently building
[14:30] <nupanick> 10 floors down first, then I use that material to build 10 floors up
[14:30] <JabJabJab> All ill say is this: I bought the game for not-half off (2 accounts) so i should deserve to test it) :P
[14:30] <Rooster> So I heard Notch is going to be streaming again?
[14:30] <Poikachoika> i bought this game at least 9 times

[14:30] <nupanick> and then connected them
[14:30] <Actown> JabJabJab: no one deserves to test it
[14:30] <JabJabJab> heheheh
[14:30] <nupanick> that strikes me as the most sane way to start a castle biuld
[14:30] <Poikachoika> it's too amazing
[14:30] <Rooster> What about C418
[14:31] <Kitoari> no one deserves the awful fate of being a tester
[14:31] <nupanick> has anyone ever tried that berfore?
[14:31] <JabJabJab> just trying to find some reason xD
[14:31] <Kitoari> DEBUGGING IS NOT FUN
[14:31] <nupanick> YES IT IS
[14:31] <Poikachoika> not even c418 is amazing enough to test it
[14:31] <Kitoari> DEBUGING?*

[14:34] <mib_8la1d5> or not work right
[14:34] <Lily_White> making diamond actually worth something
[14:34] <Kitoari> yeah that was a good idea
[14:34] <nupanick> diamonds should be uber, yes.
[14:34] <Poikachoika> but still, notch never said you had to know network debugging lol
[14:35] <nupanick> I don't like that you need a shovel to make snowballs... that just seems silly.
[14:35] <Kitoari> Poikachoika: the point of testing is to catch bugs
[14:35] <Poikachoika> all i know is i'm pro at finding problems
[14:35] <Actown> Poikachoika: true, but if you know what could be going on it helps solve the problem
[14:35] <mib_8la1d5> everything could be going and setup right, but it can still go wrong cause of hardware or something unknown
[14:35] <Kitoari> you need to have a debugging mineset
[14:35] <Poikachoika> i don't know how to fix the network buts, i know how to find the problems
[14:35] <nupanick> and I also think the newer "easier to learn" redstone is less intuitive

[14:39] <nupanick> still it's not as bad as before
[14:39] <Rooster> It's better than trying to clear snow with your hands

[15:29] <BoredGuy> anyway
[15:29] <BoredGuy> guys how do i make an infinite fountain?
[15:30] <Deepa> either 3x1 with water spawners and take the middle block
[15:30] <BoredGuy> i mean a something like a lake that never turn dry
[15:30] <Deepa> or 2x2 with water spawners
[15:30] <BoredGuy> how many water spawners?
[15:30] <Deepa> One per slot
[15:30] <Deepa> I find the 3x1 preferrable becuase then you only need 3
[15:30] <Scrippy> Many water spawners.
[15:31] <Scrippy> Or just use an ocean.
[15:31] <sockmister> It is still running really fast >.>
[15:31] <BoredGuy> what's your system?
[15:31] <sockmister> Windows XP
[15:31] <Kitoari> 2x2 only needs 2 springsd

[15:33] <Kitoari> Scrippy: nah, no caves that deep
[15:33] <sockmister> I'm working on trying to mine the obsidian
[15:33] <Kitoari> makes it harder to find diamond imo
[15:33] <Scrippy> The adminium crags are loaded with redstone.
[15:33] <Scrippy> And I use lots and lots of redstone.
[15:33] <Actown> I hate finding redstone, so much of it and I dont even use it
[15:34] <Scrippy> There will be more uses for it in the future.
[15:34] <Vis{UareALLsoDUMB}> ach, i'm bored
[15:34] <Scrippy> Just keep hoardin' it.
[15:34] <Actown> I hope so
[15:34] <Kitoari> once doors let water/lava through
[15:34] <Scrippy> Redstone is going to be the stuff of magic.

[15:34] <Boyofcheese> Hey I wonder If I can make a sort of proximity alarm

[16:56] <Snugglepop> Erm, no?
[16:56] <Scrippy> I have an ice tunnel leading to the bottom of the ocean.
[16:56] <Scrippy> It's pretty boss.
[16:56] <Snugglepop> But hey, Minecraft needs Lampreys and Triops.
[16:56] <Snugglepop> That'd be creepy.
[16:56] <sorre> i have to break 299 blocks to make a single row of progress
[16:57] <Scrippy> Minecraft needs deeper oceans
[16:57] <Scrippy> So it can house The Leviathan
[16:57] <Brotagonist> minecraft needs a way to change spawn.
[16:57] <sorre> fuck yes it does
[16:57] <sorre> i have no idea why notch has overlooked this for so long
[16:57] <sorre> it's a glaring deficiency
[16:57] * Koko|AlienSwarm is now known as Kokopure
[16:57] <SireTRM> Teh lulz.
[16:57] <Snugglepop> Minecraft needs mermaids that sing songs to attract sailors so they can kill them.
[16:57] <SireTRM> Build a base over your spawn.
[16:57] <Kokopure> well that didn't work
[16:57] <Scrippy> He said that he kind of doesn't want there to change spawn locations
[16:57] <sorre> what if we don't want to spawn on our spawn point?
[16:58] <Scrippy> But he wants faster travel.
[16:58] <sorre> that would be fair
[16:58] <Rooster> How about a general spawn location.
[16:58] <sorre> i at least want SOME way to travel quickly
[16:58] <Scrippy> Says the man himself.
[16:58] <Rooster> Several spawns in a single area.
[16:58] <Scrippy> Like horses
[16:58] <Conundrumer> snugglepop, sirens?
[16:58] <Rooster> Horses = Fuck yes
[16:58] <Scrippy> Or roads
[16:58] <Snugglepop> Yep, Sirens.
[16:58] <Scrippy> Or teleportation rituals.
[16:58] <sorre> CONVEYOR BELTS
[16:58] <SireTRM> Rooster, that already exists. If you block your original spawn, your current spawn shifts slightly.
[16:58] <Bearz> im still worried, that is there tnt limit in minecraft
[16:58] <Scrippy> Ritual magic is confirmed
[16:58] <sorre> gigantic conveyor belts
[16:58] <Snugglepop> I wonder if Minecraft will ever go as far as "mating"
[16:58] <Scrippy> And it will be awesome
[16:58] <Scrippy> tnt limit?
[16:58] <Rooster> SireTRM: I mean like a sizeable distance.
[16:58] <Snugglepop> I want to start a family with a blocky female.
[16:59] <Snugglepop> Protect my children from Creepers.
[16:59] <Rooster> blocky female
[16:59] <SireTRM> Rooster, I know, I just thought you should know. It's not what we are after for this suggestion.
[16:59] <Bearz> It's gonna be epic to own flint and steel in smp. :D Im gong to burn every forest i see
[16:59] <Scrippy> I want the option to network servers together
[16:59] <Scrippy> To make a giant world.
[16:59] <Firetempest> huge... tracks ov land
[16:59] <Rooster> Bearz be part of the solution not the problem
[16:59] <Conundrumer> I will make sure to kill every arsonist i see
[16:59] <Scrippy> Once there are towns
[16:59] <Bearz> :D
[17:00] <Scrippy> I want the outside of towns to be a terrifying terrifying place.
[17:00] <sorre> you'll burn all the forests, and end up scratching your ass with a rusty nail, because there's no wood left with which to craft a +1 Rod of Ass-Scratching
[17:00] <Conundrumer> only you can stop forest fires
[17:00] <Scrippy> And of course, as one of the first players
[17:00] <Scrippy> I will have butloads of diamond.
[17:00] <Bearz> im not going to burn any houses, but forests yes :)

[17:23] <johnsprogram> did the server crash because of that many people
[17:23] <ZeroFollower0> lol
[17:23] <Rooster> So maybe that doesn't count
[17:23] <Rooster> They had to make it R+

[18:14] <nupanick> oh yeah that might be the old survival then
[18:14] <nupanick> but the new survival is alpha
[18:14] <zork> ok

[18:19] <Conundrumer> oh
[18:19] <Conundrumer> it's been done quite a few times
[18:19] <nupanick> the idea being that you have to pull the right combination of levers before opening the door or else you will be lavad
[18:19] <nupanick> yeah
[18:19] <Conundrumer> i'm planning to make a 32/64 bit combo lock to end it
[18:19] <nupanick> you know what would be even cooler?
[18:19] <Conundrumer> a turing machine?
[18:20] <nupanick> a multiple digit entry combination lock

[18:20] <ZarroTsu> since someone will break your shit in a realistic setting before you're done

[18:20] <wolf_alex> you enter it

[18:35] <expandedcelt> maybe add a giant "Derp" underneath the sheep

[18:36] <nupanick> okay I'm lost
[18:36] <Bites> comic sans is best font
[18:36] <nupanick> is there a "sequential logic" page on the wiki?
[18:36] <nupanick> I can read wikis easier because I don't have to read them all at once to get the references.

[18:37] <nupanick> how do you make sequential logic with redstone?
[18:37] <Conundrumer> use D latches
[18:37] <expandedcelt> I can look up the infographic for you
[18:37] <nupanick> ooh
[18:38] <Conundrumer> and edge sensors
[18:38] <Flot> First of all, they should bar editing to everyone who doesn't have an account. 99% of vandalism/bad editing is done by people who just click the edit button without realizing what they're typing.
[18:38] <nupanick> huh?
[18:38] <nupanick> like what?
[18:38] <Conundrumer> make a change of state cause another change of state, put it together into a cascade, make it loop if you want it to continue running
[18:38] <Conundrumer> what exactly are you trying to make?
[18:39] <BipolarWafflez> Notch been on IRC lately?
[18:39] <nupanick> he was idling this morning
[18:39] <Bites> you know, beyond security i personally don't see much use in red dust. that's probably just me, however.
[18:39] <nupanick> anyway I want to make a thing where you input three numbers
[18:39] <Conundrumer> three bits?
[18:39] <BipolarWafflez> red dust just makes a mess everywhere
[18:39] <Vis{UareALLsoDUMB}> Ah HAH
[18:39] <nupanick> and it checks to see if they match a certain hard-coded value
[18:39] <Bites> lol
[18:39] <Vis{UareALLsoDUMB}> I figured out what was wrong

[18:40] <nupanick> but I'm not sure how to do three in a sequence
[18:40] <BipolarWafflez> would be better if the blocks were divided into four, and you could only use those smaller squares for redstone
[18:40] <Conundrumer> you mean in order?
[18:40] <nupanick> yeah
[18:40] <expandedcelt> Until multiplayer comes out, red dust is kinda useless

[18:41] * Jacob_ (chatzilla@adsl-92-246-115.asm.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[18:41] <nupanick> anyway there are other uses for redstone
[18:42] <Flot> Like building unnecessarily complicated contraptions!
[18:42] <Flot> Oh wait, that's the only use for redstone
[18:42] <nupanick> you can use underground wiring and a room full of levers to control a cart system, or cage monsters remotely
[18:43] <nupanick> you can make light switches with redstone torches to quickly lighten and darken a monster pit
[18:43] <Areals> they've been used for that

[18:45] <PrincepsRegulus> havent heard of them
[18:45] <Areals> `topic
[18:45] <PrincepsRegulus> what are they?
[18:45] <Areals> oh damn this irc needs a bot
[18:45] <PrincepsRegulus> how so?
[18:45] <Flot> Yeah. As part of either an event or a seperate gamemode, there will be certain nights where a red moon shows, and an unusually large excess of zombies come out.
[18:45] <PrincepsRegulus> cool
[18:46] <Flot> Also, I believe he said that zombies will have a limited ability to break blocks.
[18:46] <PrincepsRegulus> awesome
[18:46] <PrincepsRegulus> so zombies seige will make sense >:D

[18:48] <nupanick> and is a very good idea
[18:48] <Flot> Iunno, I like to think zombies are evil, not a valuable renewable resource.
[18:48] <nupanick> evil IS a renewable resource.
[18:48] <Areals> you can make zombie slaves or something

[18:49] <PrincepsRegulus> placing skelly summoners

[18:50] <PrincepsRegulus> very much so
[18:50] <Tukiko> Btw Flot, a practical use for redstone is to put doors sticking out of the water and make a port to keep boats from floating away.
[18:51] <Tukiko> Open and close with a switch.
[18:51] <PrincepsRegulus> i like redstone
[18:51] <PrincepsRegulus> a lot

[18:52] <PrincepsRegulus> lol
[18:52] <PrincepsRegulus> indeed!
[18:52] <Areals> Tukiko make carpet out of it
[18:52] <Keroro> Does water trigger the wooden pressure pad?
[18:52] <Tukiko> Probably just destroys it
[18:52] <PrincepsRegulus> keroro
[18:52] <PrincepsRegulus> it destroys it, i think

[18:52] <PrincepsRegulus> yeah...
[18:53] <Vis{UareALLsoDUMB}> Yes.
[18:53] <PrincepsRegulus> just like it destroys everything else
[18:53] <nupanick> we need floodgates
[18:53] <PrincepsRegulus> this shouldnt be a suprise XD
[18:53] <Vis{UareALLsoDUMB}> bigtime
[18:53] <GMP> we do
[18:53] <Conundrumer> floodgates confirmed
[18:53] <Keroro> That sucks. A torch triggered by items flowing via mobfarm onto it would be nice
[18:53] <PrincepsRegulus> hmm

[18:54] <PrincepsRegulus> idea
[18:54] <Soviet> while waiting for any additional features, i have finished my zombieland
[18:54] <nupanick> if you let water spread enough it tapers to a puddle right
[18:54] <nupanick> and then stops
[18:54] <PrincepsRegulus> just have the ceter block one lower than the rest
[18:54] <PrincepsRegulus> yeah
[18:54] <Keroro> nupanick: yes
[18:54] <PrincepsRegulus> nupa and i have same idea
[18:54] <nupanick> so just make sure the switch comes right after the last puddle
[18:54] <nupanick> and mobfarmed items should still trigger it
[18:54] <Flot> It would be nice to make a torch out of a combination of redstone and coal, so it only lights when it's triggers. A full, bright torch would look better than those dark redstone ones.

[19:33] <sorre> d'oh
[19:33] <sorre> i just ran out of pickaxes
[19:33] <Flot> Hey, is it true that mining obsidan with a diamond pick gives you a block back? Or is the Minepedia wrong on that too.
[19:33] <sorre> one block away from finishing my project, and i have to make more pickaxes
[19:33] <Gullwhacker> It's correct, I did it earlier today.
[19:33] <sorre> one single, solitary block
[19:34] <Flot> So that makes obsidan an obtainable material, neat.
[19:34] <EmpiresBane> isn't obsidian actually pretty weak?
[19:34] <Flot> It's the strongest block in the game.
[19:34] <EmpiresBane> i'm talking about RL
[19:34] <Flot> And even TNT can only go through one layer of it.
[19:34] <Conundrumer> same goes for cobblestone @tnt
[19:34] <Flot> On the moh scale it measures 5.5
[19:34] <Flot> Which is only about half of diamond IIRC
[19:35] <Flot> Yup, I'm right
[19:35] * Morde (magnus@blk-224-157-3.eastlink.ca) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[19:35] <EmpiresBane> yeah, cuz obsidian is basically like glass
[19:35] <Flot> Only a bit more than half of diamond's hardness
[19:35] <Mattress> I have like six obsidian blocks in a chest
[19:35] <EmpiresBane> but it's volcanic
[19:35] <Flot> No, it's harder than glass. 5.5 is still fairly hard.
[19:35] <EmpiresBane> yeah i know
[19:35] <EmpiresBane> but it is glass-like
[19:36] <EmpiresBane> i have some obsidian in my house somewhere...

[19:36] <Tukiko> I had a chunk of obsidian sitting on my dresser. Forgot about it until I packed it yesterday.
[19:37] <EmpiresBane> it's transparent, feels like glass when it's smoothed

[19:40] <SireTRM> Ah, 21 TNT to blow a hole through a mountain.
[19:40] <Keroro> If so, can't you just make a building with an outer layer, and an inner layer 1 square apart, and fill the gaps with water so when creepers explode outside there's only that small part to mend?

[19:59] <So_Useless> Flot, that could actually be useful for finding underground caves.
[19:59] <Mattress> It'd be useful for finding zombie spawn cages
[19:59] <So_Useless> Assuming that the AI doesn't change too much.
[19:59] <Mattress> Unless they mine out in eevery direction
[19:59] <Flot> I doubt that zombies will be able to break through pure stone...
[19:59] <Flot> That would create a lot of noise.
[20:00] <So_Useless> Well, it would help with finding shallow caves, then... I guess. Depending on if the roof is easily accessible.
[20:00] <So_Useless> Having zombies erupt from the ground would be pretty neat, though.
[20:00] <Flot> I bet it'll end up being something like "If you don't need a pickaxe to get the material from it, zombies can break through it.

[20:30] <SireTRM> Signs can fit 60 characters?

[20:31] <Conundrumer> the beauty lies within the holyshitcomplex-ness of this machine
[20:31] <EmpiresBane> i just realized something
[20:31] <SireTRM> Well, even presuming 60 characters, it's at least 62^60, and that's only counting a-z, A-Z, 0-9
[20:31] <Globular> http://www.screensnapr.com/ better than imageshack
[20:31] <Phil> I think you are lieing

[20:32] <Phil> whats it do?
[20:32] * EmpiresBane is away: delving into windows menus, might be awhile before i return
[20:32] <ZarroTsu> really I'm falling into the "what the hell is the point of red dust" crowd of people, lately. Unless you do it in total secret where nobody can see you, it's going to be a total bitch to set up redstone. Even still, I can only fathom good use for light switches at most.

[20:34] <ZarroTsu> in the time it would take to set up a combination lock, and I mean a good one with buttons rather than binary switching, you've already lost the shit you wanted to protect, and/or someone is behind you fucking up your circuit.
[20:34] <ZarroTsu> and yes, I know adventure mode
[20:34] <EmpiresBane> ZarroTsu, http://notch.tumblr.com/post/779956568/the-rationale-for-redstone
[20:34] <sorre> umm
[20:34] <sorre> you seem to be implying that it would have to be done on-the-fly
[20:35] <SireTRM> The dust can be made into torches, then the two things can be used to make logic gates through to computers.
[20:35] <ZarroTsu> I'm talking "until then, and in multiplayer"
[20:35] <Sketchy> Conundrumer, that thing is going to take up to ten secons for a single operation :D
[20:35] <sorre> you don't seem to notice that you can do all that shit BEFORE someone shows up
[20:35] <sorre> and trigger it when they do
[20:35] <Phil> so I accidentally spent the last day before gf leaves for a while playing games with my nerd friend... now icant see her for a few weeks
[20:35] <ZarroTsu> define 'before'
[20:35] <EmpiresBane> minecraft would be a little boring if everything was for gathering resources
[20:35] <sorre> way before
[20:35] <Conundrumer> we'll see, sketchy
[20:35] <chariot> you could also, ya know, stop and fight off whoever is attacking you...
[20:35] <sorre> as in, when you build the vault
[20:35] <EmpiresBane> something to do when you get bored of that is needed
[20:35] <sorre> >build vault
[20:35] <sorre> >build security system
[20:35] <sorre> >somebody shows up
[20:36] <sorre> >trigger security system
[20:36] <sorre> >kaboom
[20:36] <Areals> build vault out of grass
[20:36] <ZarroTsu> because you know, if you're making it on your own server before you even put the server up; what the hell will other people think, when they see that only you have sophistocated vaults and button locks?
[20:36] <SireTRM> To be quite honest, 20 seconds at an iron door would work.

[20:37] <sorre> it's not going to be fun if NOBODY is out to fuck your shit

[20:38] <tj505050> hi truewolves
[20:38] <sorre> really, if you build securely underground, you never have to worry about monsters
[20:39] <Conundrumer> complex circuits in smp can be used to show off how powerful you are
[20:39] <Conundrumer> like a status thing
[20:39] <ZarroTsu> and yet, you can never see other people either
[20:39] <sorre> at that point, it's creative mode with hit points
[20:39] <sorre> and resource gathering
[20:39] <Conundrumer> equivalent to gold decoration
[20:39] <SireTRM> 1 block of TNT in that circuit, it's not working for a bit.
[20:39] <ZarroTsu> what's the point of multiplayer if you're going to spend all your time alone?
[20:39] <sorre> you're not
[20:39] <Phil> ok well im gonna have fun, you guys enjoy your whining fest
[20:39] <ZarroTsu> then why do you want multiplayer
[20:39] <Phil> smp should be awesome
[20:40] <sorre> you ARE, however, going to want a secure place to stash your valuables
[20:40] <sorre> hence a vault with defenses
[20:40] <EmpiresBane> the point of redstone is to have fun

[21:17] <Rooster> Creepers blowing up the side of your wall is both terrifying and FUCKING AWESOME.
[21:17] <sorre> F11 is glitchy
[21:17] <So_Useless> I have trapped a sheep with a water flow before. I sheared it, and left it for later.
[21:17] <sorre> seems like it's at least somewhat related to aero
[21:17] <So_Useless> I came back after building a biodome, a lava defense around my base, and starting an art gallery... and it was still there.
[21:17] <Azur> Notch is an expert at owning Creepers o-o
[21:17] <So_Useless> Still naked.
[21:17] <sorre> i don't care if that witch paralyzed you and took your axe, i'm not helping you get it back this time
[21:18] <So_Useless> I did the only humane thing and killed it with my bare hands.
[21:18] <TehButter> Hmm...
[21:18] <TehButter> This whirlpool of mine

[21:19] <TehButter> Well im dealing with two layer
[21:20] <So_Useless> Screenshot perhaps? Just for curiosity's sake?
[21:20] <So_Useless> Unless you are too busy.
[21:20] <Conundrumer> ie making a dirt platform under one layer of water

[21:50] <mib_r6c1kn> Life got flipped turned upside down
[21:50] <mib_r6c1kn> And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there

[21:50] <mib_r6c1kn> On the playground is where I spent most of my days

[21:50] <mib_r6c1kn> And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
[21:50] <mib_r6c1kn> When a couple of guys, who were up to no good
[21:50] <mib_r6c1kn> Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood

[21:52] <TrueWolves> I'm writting a script if rickroll get's played
[21:52] <Rooster> lol
[21:52] <TrueWolves> it will ban you
[21:52] <Bearz> ahhhh coffee<3
[21:52] <EmpiresBane> Kom, he spaced the lines just enought so that he wouldn't hit the limit
[21:52] <TehButter> Winscript

[21:52] <Keroro> TrueWolves, what client do you use?
[21:52] <Bearz> ahhhhh feels good man
[21:52] <TehButter> True, what client
[21:52] <So_Useless> Then they will just switch to belair.
[21:52] <TehButter> beat me to it
[21:52] <TrueWolves> I am also writing a script that if you monolog for 10+ lines it will ban you.
[21:52] <Kom> Fun
[21:52] <TehButter> monolog?
[21:52] <EmpiresBane> ban?
[21:52] <TehButter> ._.
[21:52] <TrueWolves> ... only I don't know how to write mIRC scripts
[21:52] <TehButter> I do
[21:52] <EmpiresBane> shouldn't it just kick?
[21:52] <TehButter> ...To an extent
[21:52] <chariot> mirc is really easy
[21:52] <So_Useless> If you talk for more than ten lines without anyone else saying anything.
[21:52] <Kom> Then again, some IRC clients can be set to send large amounts of text at a specific rate
[21:52] <chariot> and thats a dumb reason to ban for
[21:53] <TrueWolves> This channel is huge, it's impossible to talk more then 10 lines by yourself unless your spamming.

[21:53] <TrueWolves> we could do what #Furry does
[21:53] <EmpiresBane> before i realized i was the only person talking
[21:53] <Kom> And what do they do?
[21:53] <EmpiresBane> we could have ops in different timezones

[21:54] <TrueWolves> I'll run it over with the other ops.
[21:54] <EmpiresBane> you don't have to voice
[21:54] <EmpiresBane> you could store regulers locally
[21:54] <TehButter> m
[21:54] <TehButter> More complex
[21:54] <TrueWolves> voicing makes the coding easier, but isn't nessary.
[21:54] <TehButter> rather voice
[21:54] <Keroro> EmpiresBane: That's not a good idea.

[21:55] <EmpiresBane> Keroro, why so?
[21:55] <Kom> If he stores it locally, he'd have to implement some way of allowing the other ops 'access' to said system
[21:55] <TrueWolves> or I could not sleep
[21:55] <Bearz> this isn't really the biggest channel which im on now
[21:55] <Evicous> Well, how do you define who a regular is and who isn't a regular?
[21:55] <Keroro> If the list of regulars is lost it means that we have to make it again from scratch
[21:55] <TrueWolves> Evicous, are you contributing to the chat for more then a day?
[21:55] <TrueWolves> Congrats, you have a voice.
[21:55] <Keroro> if we set regulars to autovoice the server keeps the list for us
[21:55] <Evicous> Ah.
[21:55] <So_Useless> Trolls do not have long term commitment.
[21:55] <Kom> define contributing...
[21:55] <Bearz> actually one where im has this mutch: Total of 1889 nicks [13 ops, 0 halfops, 6 voices, 1870 normal]
[21:55] <Evicous> Sounds good to me.
[21:55] <Bearz> but it doesn't have this mutch conversation
[21:55] <TrueWolves> for now, I'll just not sleep and watch this channel unless other ops are on
[21:55] <EmpiresBane> TrueWolves, that's why ops need to be indifferent timezones
[21:56] <Keroro> 13 ops 1870 users. Jesus christ that's an incredibly bottom heavy chan.
[21:56] <TrueWolves> Empirer, that's why I got hired in the first place.
[21:56] <So_Useless> Well, the only trolls are spammers so far. Not the most creative bunch.
[21:56] <EmpiresBane> what timezone are you in?
[21:56] <TrueWolves> I'm op when a lot of other ops are not
[21:56] <Bearz> not really
[21:56] <Bearz> it has nice scripts
[21:56] <Kom> I've been here for probably a month, but have hardly found much worth saying on most occasions.
[21:56] <UnknownX> I'm surprised that there isn't any halfops
[21:56] <TrueWolves> Timezone doesn't matter that much, some people are on at night in their time zones and some on at day
[21:56] <Bearz> bot is kicking everybody whos flooding, and the channel accepts connections from only finnish host's

[21:57] <Bearz> actually the channel is in quakenet
[21:57] <Bearz> and the quakenet doesn't use halfops
[21:57] <Bearz> coz it's not really useful.. lol
[21:57] <Evicous> As for me, I've been lurking for a long time. Having a Regulars thing might actually force me to contribute to the conversation occasionally
[21:57] <Link2006> arent we in espernet?
[21:57] <UnknownX> I'm talking about here too
[21:57] <Keroro> My actual timezone is GMT+1 but I actually go to sleep at like 6AM and wake at 4PM
[21:57] <chivalrousWeasel> We are in esper.net.
[21:57] <EmpiresBane> Bearz, this is espernet, not quakenet
[21:57] <TrueWolves> Anyhow, the regular things can be worked out later
[21:57] <Link2006> ^ yeah
[21:57] <TrueWolves> I'll just work and sleep less for now.
[21:57] <Bearz> mine is GMT+2, and i go sleep at about 4pm and wake at night
[21:58] <Bearz> =)
[21:58] <UnknownX> No pain, no gain
[21:58] <chariot> Yeah mentioning other networks is forbidden apparently!
[21:58] <tj505050> ok remember the old holenow look before http://imgur.com/fueHP.png after http://imgur.com/LqzQj.png
[21:58] <TrueWolves> ... it is?
[21:58] <chivalrousWeasel> What?
[21:58] <Kom> Why don't the OPs find more responsible people to aid them?
[21:58] <EmpiresBane> GMT+8.
[21:58] <So_Useless> Unknown, however pain does not neccessitate gain.
[21:58] <chivalrousWeasel> I'm just correcting Bearz.
[21:58] <EmpiresBane> i'm so alone...
[21:58] <chivalrousWeasel> #minecraft is not in quakenet.
[21:58] * AoC (tt@186.97.25.104) has joined #minecraft
[21:58] <chariot> duh
[21:58] <sorre> holy shit
[21:58] <Bearz> chiv, yes?
[21:58] <EmpiresBane> and i've gotten much gain without pain
[21:58] <chivalrousWeasel> So, what's your point?
[21:58] <sorre> there are a LOT of monsters in this room up ahead
[21:58] <Bearz> i know that :3
[21:58] <Gullwhacker> Okay, I think I can finish this construction reasonably. Eight blocks before I run out of room. Planning on using three on my capstone, so...hm. Make that two on the capstone, and it might work.
[21:59] <sorre> so far, i've lured out two creepers, four zombies, a spider, and a skeleton
[21:59] <TrueWolves> as far as it matters, I'm still not here, don't bother me.
[21:59] <sorre> weeeeeird
[21:59] <tj505050> like it
[21:59] <EmpiresBane> hrm....
[21:59] <So_Useless> So, in conclusion, "No pain no gain" is not only false, it isn't even a very creative rhyme.
[21:59] <Bearz> im in four different servers now.. ;o
[21:59] * TrueWolves sets the bottom 3~4 lines of the channel visible as he works on other stuff on other windows.
[21:59] <Bearz> and about in 40 channels
[21:59] <tj505050> ok remember the old holenow look before http://imgur.com/fueHP.png after http://imgur.com/LqzQj.png
[21:59] <EmpiresBane> hehe that's what i always do
[22:00] <Keroro> I'm in 7 servers and 11 channels.
[22:00] <EmpiresBane> that way if somebody talks to me, i can glance and see if it's worth replying to
[22:00] <tj505050> what do you think
[22:00] <EmpiresBane> i'm on 1 server and 7 channels
[22:00] <Conundrumer> just leaving this here one more time: http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/1562/07212010230251.png
[22:00] <Keroro> Being in more is useless. Being in 20+ channels just means you like to join channels in which nobody talks, usually.
[22:00] <Rooster> I'm on 1 channel
[22:00] <So_Useless> You have a nice forge collection.
[22:00] <tj505050> yay

[22:01] <So_Useless> Indeed.
[22:01] <EmpiresBane> Keroro, people might talk often

[22:05] <So_Useless> Swordfight a pirate! Stripmine an asteroid! Have sex with green aliens of an indeterminate gender. It can all happen in books!
[22:05] <EmpiresBane> um... not many
[22:05] <TrueWolves> Daniel Remar has a number of great free games.
[22:06] <TrueWolves> Hero, Iji, Hero Core
[22:06] <Keroro> Tremulous.
[22:06] <Bearz> i dont remember when i read a book last time
[22:06] <Bearz> and im in college

[22:08] <TrueWolves> Hero Core is one of the funner games I've ever played, dispite being completely in black and white.
[22:08] <Bearz> i should print my IRC logs and go to the publisher
[22:08] <TrueWolves> Hero is decent-meh, but fun for a while until you beat it.

[22:20] <sorre> who else could see a Minecraft logo hat looking awesome?

[22:22] <LordAidan> Orly
[22:22] <LordAidan> Oh well
[22:23] <EmpiresBane> somebody was already making creeper plushies
[22:23] <Pelum> wait what?

[22:32] <Keroro> Ah, okay.
[22:32] <nupanick> in fact I don't think you CAN make cloth armor anymore
[22:32] <nupanick> leather armor replaced it
[22:32] <Keroro> I have a tonne of it, so it might be useful
[22:32] * TrueWolves still thinks there should be padded armor and leather armor with the leather armor slightly better but needing to go through some process to harden it.

[22:33] <TrueWolves> this would make iron and diamond armor more useful and add in a 4 tier system like weapons have with wood-stone-iron-diamond.
[22:33] <Bearz> so is mail armor real in survival?
[22:33] <vurtual> so there's actually a thing called "Heavy Mithril"
[22:33] <nupanick> not really that high on the list of things that are important though
[22:33] <vurtual> as a genre of music
[22:33] <nupanick> hahaha
[22:33] <nupanick> and I dunno bearz
[22:33] <TrueWolves> Yeah, it's a good idea but no where near importnt.
[22:33] <nupanick> there's "iron armor"
[22:33] <nupanick> and "diamond armor"
[22:33] <Bearz> you but if you connect the fire..
[22:33] <nupanick> but I dunno about "mail"
[22:33] <Bearz> i saw those pictures
[22:33] <nupanick> maybe it was a custom skin?
[22:33] <vurtual> there's chainmail in the game
[22:33] <Bearz> i dunno are they fake ;o
[22:34] <vurtual> but it has no way to be crafted by anyone who isn't absolutely insane and stoned
[22:34] <nupanick> there is? how do you make it?
[22:34] <Bearz> yeah.. i meaned chainmail..
[22:34] <vurtual> because chainmail
[22:34] <vurtual> is made from FIRE
[22:34] <vurtual> raw, pure fire
[22:34] <TrueWolves> There is chainmail in the game, it needs to be hacked to be used.

[22:34] <Pelum> fire and brimstone?
[22:34] <TrueWolves> no, just fire.
[22:34] <nupanick> well now we know what to look for next Secret Friday.

[22:34] <Pelum> and pieces of rainbow?
[22:34] * LuciferZ1 is now known as LuciferZ
[22:34] <Scrippy> Chainmail has been in there for a while.
[22:35] <Scrippy> I don't see it being implemented any time soon
[22:35] <vurtual> chainmail is entirely functional and normal
[22:35] <vurtual> just like any other armor
[22:35] <vurtual> but good luck getting fire
[22:35] <nupanick> but... you... what?
[22:35] <Pelum> whats its armour rating?
[22:35] <Pelum> same as iron?
[22:35] <vurtual> somewhere between leather and iron I think
[22:35] <Pelum> better then iron?
[22:35] <nupanick> probably between iron and diamond
[22:35] <Scrippy> At least not until we have expanded crafting options.
[22:35] <Pelum> i see
[22:35] <Scrippy> Chainmail would, logically, be better against arrows.
[22:35] <TrueWolves> it's between iron and leather
[22:35] * Rooster (stormon@pool-108-13-97-76.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) has left #minecraft
[22:35] <vurtual> so like, think there'll end up being chainmail of fire?

[22:36] <Pelum> why is gold armour in the game apart from to look like win?
[22:36] <vurtual> no else
[22:36] <Scrippy> Just to look win.
[22:36] <Scrippy> It is shiny
[22:36] <Pelum> thought so
[22:36] <Scrippy> Just like real gold.
[22:36] <LordAidan> If you want to be pimo
[22:36] <Scrippy> Also shitty
[22:36] <sorre> awesome, found one bucket of lava
[22:36] <LordAidan> *pimp
[22:36] <vurtual> or a %, based off the % that the individual armor slot would take up, so wearing full chainmail of fire=full fire resistance
[22:36] <Scrippy> Just like real gold.
[22:36] <LordAidan> Thats why.
[22:36] <TrueWolves> Pelum, purely becuase people would beg for gold to be craftable in to armor, so Notch added it, and made it realisticly crap
[22:36] <sorre> only four more to go
[22:37] <Pelum> i used gold armour when im sailing on a boat
[22:37] <Pelum> just because i can
[22:37] <vurtual> also gold chainmail should be an armor
[22:37] <vurtual> not quite as good as normal chainmail probably?
[22:37] <vurtual> Wait, would gold chainmail irl be better or worse?
[22:37] <Pelum> also power rings
[22:37] <Pelum> >__>
[22:37] <Tukiko> worse
[22:37] <vurtual> How protective and durable would such an armor be?

[22:38] <TrueWolves> becuase it takes time and gold to make, having some was a sign of a lot of richs. Really it was a form of expencive clothing, not armor.
[22:38] <EmpiresBane> you would get gold!

[22:38] <vurtual> hmmm
[22:39] <Pelum> damascus steel
[22:39] <Pelum> mmmm
[22:39] <nupanick> gold wire would be nice
[22:39] <TrueWolves> Tukiko, cred comes (partly) from looks, so it's implied.
[22:39] <nupanick> it conducts much better than copper
[22:39] <nupanick> or whatever this red stuff is
[22:39] * vurtual continues to figure out some way to make pure gold into something stronger
[22:39] <Pelum> redstuff is redstone
[22:39] <Pelum> what are you tlaking about copper
[22:39] <Tukiko> Stop sayign things that contradict what I say in the least. :(
[22:39] <Pelum> >__>
[22:39] <TrueWolves> It's RedStone, a material that exsists in MineCraft but not the real world.
[22:39] <nupanick> golden apples are pretty valuavble
[22:39] <nupanick> ah okay
[22:39] <vurtual> oh guys I have an idea on how to use gold for a semi-useful but still silly weapon
[22:39] <nupanick> I still think gold wires are probably better than reddust.
[22:40] <nupanick> gold zombie knife?
[22:40] <nupanick> what?
[22:40] <vurtual> make a wood sword, then craft it with gold, and some kind of electrical source
[22:40] <TrueWolves> gold doesn't need to be stronger in real life. It's maulability and conductivity is what has made it become so useful in real life after years of just being vaulable for looks and rarity.
[22:40] <Pelum> golden bow of doom and jelly beans?
[22:40] <vurtual> then you get a gold-plated sword that zaps things
[22:40] <nupanick> well put wolves
[22:40] <vurtual> that glows
[22:41] <vurtual> and makes electrical sounds when it swings
[22:41] <TrueWolves> gold weapons/armor will be the best enchantable material if Notch adds a system to do so, he said that at least.
[22:41] <nupanick> ahh
[22:41] <TrueWolves> diamonds being second, then wood, stone, last iron.
[22:41] <nupanick> that makes sense at least
[22:41] <Pelum> +2 mace gold armour
[22:41] <Pelum> :D
[22:41] <vurtual> zapping enemies and doing other cool electricity stuff

[22:42] <Pelum> kamehameha wave from a sword into something?
[22:42] <Pelum> D:
[22:43] <vurtual> and other bonus-damagable things would be hit by arcs of electricity for half a heart or more
[22:43] <vurtual> the bonus damage would do nothing to the armor, because conducting wouldn't hurt it

[23:31] <TrueWolves> you can't shoot them
[23:31] <sorre> HOW DO YOU KNOW
[23:31] <TrueWolves> so the aim assist there would be bad.
[23:31] <Keroro> >implying there wont be small areas in certain places you need to place precision portals on, and that these wont be aim assisted
[23:31] <sorre> game isn't out yet
[23:32] <TrueWolves> I'm basing my logic out on the first one.
[23:32] <vurtual> but then you'd just notice the aim assist
[23:32] <vurtual> which would ruin the puzzle

[23:33] <Keroro> In these games it cannot be turned off
[23:33] <vurtual> it made the game a lot easier.
[23:33] <vurtual> waaay easier
[23:33] <sorre> i wouldn't know, vurt, i wasn't stupid enough to buy the orange box on the 360
[23:33] <Vladivostok> those were the days
[23:33] <Pelum> console fps lol
[23:33] <Vladivostok> :D
[23:33] <vurtual> like, really
[23:33] <vurtual> except occasionally charging at someone
[23:33] <Pelum> have fun with your halos and your gears of war
[23:33] <vurtual> goldeneye was many times easier without the aim thing
[23:33] <Keroro> I'm a PC gamer, but I was making a point
[23:33] <Pelum> goldeneye was the only true console fps
[23:34] <Pelum> that and perfect dark
[23:34] <TrueWolves> perfect dark was a good one.
[23:34] <Pelum> but not that horrible xbox release of perfect dark
[23:34] <vurtual> You know, I've sorta wanted a stealthy spy game
[23:34] * Vicrry__ (Vicrry@c-24-2-12-4.hsd1.mo.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[23:34] <Pelum> that was bad
[23:34] <Bearz> console fpses are phun
[23:34] <vurtual> where you had lua added
[23:34] <vurtual> like, something like goldeneye, or more sanely: Nightfire
[23:34] <Bearz> but all the kids in console games
[23:34] <vurtual> but you could make SWEPs
[23:34] <Pelum> we got new goldeneye soon
[23:34] <Pelum> :D
[23:34] <Bearz> ...i hate them
[23:34] <Genemos> SWETs?
[23:35] <Keroro> SWEPS, mod files.
[23:35] <vurtual> scripted weapons
[23:35] <vurtual> like garry's mod
[23:35] <Genemos> I see
[23:35] <vurtual> and use any of the cool spy-weapon-effects already in the game, for ease of use
[23:35] <vurtual> (because that's one thing garry's mod always lacked, the coded weapon effects being available)
[23:35] * Vicrry_ (Vicrry@c-24-2-12-4.hsd1.mo.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[23:36] <vurtual> then make tranquilizer dart pistols, or like, even better
[23:36] <vurtual> miniguns that fire rockets :D
[23:36] <Genemos> ahh well
[23:36] <Pelum> actually mission impossible 64 wasnt bad either
[23:36] <vurtual> I loved that
[23:36] <Genemos> most games seem to be going towards being able to modify less and less
[23:36] <Genemos> with the occasional exception
[23:36] * Helar (Helar@78-28-67-1.cdma.dyn.kou.ee) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)

[23:36] <Genemos> but still
[23:36] <Pelum> GREEN LIGHT
[23:36] <Pelum> do doooooooooooo
[23:36] <vurtual> or the JC2 magical assault rifle where I turned up the stats weirdly so vehicles magically exploded, people zoomed off into the sky in a pillar of blood, and helicopters after a shot or two(sometimes) would start smoking, then spin backwards in place, while the people inside would keep shooting at you
[23:37] <Genemos> ahhh
[23:37] <Genemos> just cause :P
[23:37] <vurtual> jc2 should've had lua
[23:37] <vurtual> ...and firstperson
[23:37] <Genemos> hah, indeed
[23:37] <Genemos> might have bought it
[23:37] <Genemos> if it hadn't been for that grappling hook :P
[23:37] <vurtual> imagine a tranquilizer stealth pistol in jc2
[23:38] <Einherjar> good god
[23:38] <vurtual> ragdolls someone down for a long while
[23:38] <vurtual> Genemos, grappling hook...
[23:38] <vurtual> being a bad thing?
[23:38] <Einherjar> I just went to explore a natural cave and I found out the tunnels beneath my base connected to it somehow
[23:38] <Einherjar> goddamn I love this game
[23:38] <Genemos> nice
[23:38] <Genemos> or a bit less nice
[23:38] <Keroro> I build up a tower and only ever travelled east of it
[23:38] <Genemos> if it stops you from expanding the way you wanted
[23:38] * nupanick (Nick_Lamic@cpe-69-207-6-122.buffalo.res.rr.com) has left #minecraft
[23:39] <Einherjar> and it's a fuck huge cave too with all these natural lava and water flows
[23:39] <Keroro> when I came back, and looked west I was on the very tip of a huge cave lip
[23:39] <Genemos> btw, Einherjar, do you play mount and blade by any chance?
[23:39] <Bearz> i want yamaha yzf-r1 :(
[23:39] <Einherjar> Yes, yes I do
[23:39] <vurtual> Genemos
[23:39] <Einherjar> Why?
[23:39] <vurtual> how is the grapplehook in jc2 a bad thing?
[23:40] <Soviet> mob spawner by map editor works well
[23:40] <Genemos> was just curious
[23:40] <Genemos> and well
[23:40] <Soviet> but when it is placed by player, it is not
[23:40] <Genemos> It got me kinda stumped
[23:40] * Synthpixel (SynthvPixe@cpe-76-83-241-130.dc.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[23:40] <Genemos> to easy to screw those things up
[23:40] <Genemos> and the reason I asked
[23:40] <vurtual> ...
[23:40] <Einherjar> I play Warband, actually, and the GLORIOUS SARRANID EMPIRE has expanded to control almost half the map
[23:40] <vurtual> why are you pretending I'm not here? :(
[23:40] * holypalaswe (Nyman@81-224-255-121-no80.tbcn.telia.com) has joined #minecraft
[23:40] <Genemos> is that a quite big clan in M&B is called Einherjar :P
[23:40] <Einherjar> orly
[23:41] <Genemos> I am not
[23:41] <Einherjar> I've never gotten into online play

[23:41] <Genemos> quite the coincidence
[23:41] <Genemos> and sorry
[23:41] <Genemos> but
[23:41] <Genemos> I just saw the video
[23:41] <Pelum> i know your here vurtual thats all that matters

[23:42] <sorre> i tapped 'q' while holding my buckets over lava
[23:42] <Genemos> didn't get interetsted :P
[23:42] <vurtual> JC2's greatest limitation was the scriptedness of the actions
[23:42] <vurtual> giving you limited innovation in combat
[23:42] <Monte> NOTCH
[23:42] <Monte> ADD
[23:42] <Monte> HOOKSHOTS
[23:42] <Monte> >:(
[23:42] <vurtual> as in, we couldn't like, grapple onto the rotors
[23:42] <vurtual> and spin around and kick the other rotor out
[23:42] <Genemos> yeah
[23:42] <vurtual> mauling ourselves, spiraling around, and parachuting to our safety
[23:43] <Synthpixel> Sounds like something great for a moddable, but too out of place in-game
[23:43] <Genemos> these days I mostly like the indie games the most
[23:43] <Genemos> Dwarf fortress
[23:43] <Genemos> Minecraft
[23:43] <vurtual> DF is not "indie"
[23:43] <vurtual> It is a proper freeware game, of the old time
[23:43] <vurtual> when you didn't call every game "indie"
[23:43] <Genemos> ahahahahaha :P
[23:43] <Synthpixel> vurtual, It's indie, it was made by an independant developer
[23:43] <Genemos> well
[23:43] <Genemos> anyway
[23:43] <Monte> Dwarf Fortress is a bad game
[23:43] <vurtual> If you call it indie, you're a screwed up, sad person, and also born yesterday.
[23:43] <Genemos> lol
[23:43] <Genemos> it is awesome
[23:43] <Monte> And you should kill yourself for liking it
[23:44] <Monte> ignored
[23:44] <vurtual> monte no I WILL KILL YOU

[23:44] <Genemos> I agree with virtual
[23:44] <vurtual> Either monte is joking or this is about to get funny.
[23:44] <Genemos> No, dwarf fortress is awesome
[23:44] * mnjiman (Mibbit@d24-57-104-173.home.cgocable.net) has joined #minecraft
[23:44] <Synthpixel> I would agree, but indie only actually means one thing, and that is that the developer is independant. Yes, there's a culture around indie games, but that doesn't mean every indie game requires that culture.
[23:45] <Genemos> well
[23:45] <Genemos> to me
[23:45] <Genemos> indie
[23:45] <Genemos> is
[23:45] <Genemos> make the game you want to make
[23:45] <vurtual> I hate all this indie stuff
[23:45] <Genemos> without a-holes like activision making the decisions
[23:45] <sorre> indie is typing sentences in many, many lines?
[23:45] <vurtual> "lookameeee I made something silly and short and with little production value now watch everyone buy it because they refuse to play any proper games!"
[23:46] <Pelum> to me indie is running a casino on sacred land
[23:46] <Pelum> >__>
[23:46] <vurtual> even worse is the open-source-only people
[23:46] <vurtual> by law
[23:46] <sorre> ATI: ENEMY OF YOUR FREEDOM
[23:46] * holypalaswe (Nyman@81-224-255-121-no80.tbcn.telia.com) Quit (Quit: pvp is hard)
[23:46] <vurtual> They'll never play anything that isn't open source.
[23:46] <Synthpixel> wat
[23:46] <Bearz> can you guys buy me yamaha yzf-r6.. or r1 :3
[23:46] <vurtual> They have yet to find a good open source FPS, so they say all FPSes are horrible
[23:46] <Synthpixel> ATI, enemy?
[23:46] <vurtual> no matter what you do, nothing will stop them
[23:46] <vurtual> These people are real
[23:46] <sorre> i don't know anyone so neckbearded that they won't play closed-source games
[23:46] <Genemos> where/en did ATI become an enemy?
[23:47] <vurtual> One of them plays wesnoth.
[23:47] <vurtual> They also barely speak English, they're German, so that makes sense.
[23:47] <vurtual> I am talking like a comic book character and it seems cool.
[23:47] <Synthpixel> Honestly though
[23:47] <sorre> http://static.blogo.it/ossblog/rms_ati_boycott.jpg
[23:47] <Synthpixel> Complete Annihilation on the spring engine is probably the best RTS I've ever played
[23:47] * asiekierka is now known as spritiualEnergalist
[23:47] <vurtual> no BA is better :|
[23:48] <vurtual> my computer's SLI runs off an antifreedom fuel cell

[23:48] <Synthpixel> BA relies too much on knowing all the special attributes of units and which ones are completely useless
[23:48] <vurtual> The entirety of Islam extremists are fuel cells for me.
[23:48] <Synthpixel> while in CA, all units are useful for certain purposes
[23:48] <vurtual> Okay, there's the flash tank... and the flash tank.
[23:48] <Synthpixel> Exactly!
[23:48] <Sketchy> wish there was a way to force maps to generate floating islands by spawn
[23:48] <Sketchy> or
[23:48] <vurtual> You might want to use the peewee and rocko too.
[23:48] <Sketchy> a way to move spawn
[23:48] <vurtual> or the jethro I guess
[23:49] <Mattress> Guys
[23:49] <sorre> muslim extremists? is their annihilation -that- efficient?
[23:49] <vurtual> or the plasma kbot, hovertanks
[23:49] <Synthpixel> That pretty much points out why I hate most RTS's
[23:49] <Mattress> A java batch won't run for me
[23:49] <vurtual> sorre their antifreedoms
[23:49] <Mattress> What am I doing wrong
[23:49] <vurtual> are really, really efficient
[23:49] <vurtual> also there's most of the planes
[23:49] <vurtual> Yes, there are some "useless" units, but you'll find a use
[23:49] <Synthpixel> Yes, suicide
[23:49] <vurtual> I've used almost every ARM kbot for something.
[23:49] <Synthpixel> Flash spam wins out in the end
[23:49] <vurtual> Depending on the terrain at hand(read: not just speedmetal and the same two other maps)
[23:50] <Synthpixel> (I don't know what they play nowadays, I haven't played seriously in two years)
[23:50] <vurtual> also there's the weird COM guys who will flood your base with krogoths
[23:50] <Synthpixel> Pyro spam
[23:50] <Synthpixel> Was always my favorite in BA
[23:50] <vurtual> no
[23:50] <vurtual> krogoth spam
[23:50] <vurtual> ...everywhere
[23:50] <vurtual> locking you in with geothermal cannons
[23:50] <Synthpixel> Talk about turtling the entire match
[23:50] <vurtual> then quickly producing so many krogoths, you can't move your units
[23:50] <vurtual> because it's a SEA OF KROGOTHS

[23:52] <Synthpixel> What icon do you have?
[23:52] <vurtual> but most pros pwn me
[23:52] <vurtual> at least the... sergeanty one
[23:52] <vurtual> not a star-medal thingy yeet

[23:52] <vurtual> I don't handle big maps well

[23:53] <vurtual> I find it funny how technically very illegal Ubuntu's repos are
[23:53] <Synthpixel> Also that enemy of your freedom guy better not be Stallman
[23:53] <Brotagonist> repos?
[23:53] <Synthpixel> Howso?
[23:53] <vurtual> a TA mod being put in as an installer link in the main menu for Spring
[23:53] <sorre> hahaha, stallman
[23:53] <sorre> what a goober
[23:53] <vurtual> (when they always advocate that they are nooot officially related and that you should own it blah blah blah)
[23:54] <sorre> "I'd like to interject for a moment..."
[23:54] <vurtual> and then SNES emulators on the official things
[23:54] <Synthpixel> It's giving you the choice to install it
[23:54] <Synthpixel> It's not saying it's open source and installing it for you
[23:54] <vurtual> no, but still
[23:54] <vurtual> that'd get them in a lot of trouble if someone who cared noticed
[23:54] <Synthpixel> It specifically says that you require a TA license to play
[23:55] <vurtual> now you know what'd be great
[23:55] <vurtual> if wesnoth wasn't so boring
[23:55] <vurtual> There are two outcomes: The offchance you play super-efficiently, and screw over everyone else because everyone is at the same skill level(this is how you win, otherwise it's a stalemate)
[23:55] <vurtual> or normally, and lose

[23:59] <vurtual> ...can you make multiple-floor maps in Alien Swarm?
[23:59] <vurtual> What would it look like?
[23:59] <vurtual> what if you made the camera pass under something?
[23:59] <Genemos> doh, feel into lava and died, damn it :(
