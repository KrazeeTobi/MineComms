[1:33] <LG_Legacy> CruelNoise WHAT IS A MAN, A MISERABLE PILE OF SECRETS?
[1:33] <CruelNoise> Hmm?
[1:33] <LG_Legacy> You don't get the reference?
[1:33] <Diablodoct0r> CruelNoise one must travel to the ancient mountains of Khaz'd Al Dhum
[1:34] <EmpiresBane> rule ??
[1:34] <Diablodoct0r> And then, one must have sex with a pile of moss.
[1:34] <EmpiresBane> no girls on the internet
[1:34] <Diablodoct0r> Only by proving you are that daring,
[1:34] <Snowman> One thing you could count on, you push a man too far, and sooner or later he'd start pushing back.
[1:34] <Diablodoct0r> You prove you have the courage of a real man.
[1:34] <Diablodoct0r> And you've proven that you are in fact a man, and was that the entire year anyway.
[1:34] <CruelNoise> Thanks to my parents, I'm a rather uncultured young man, so, no, i don't get your reference.
[1:34] <Diablodoct0r> Just travel to Khaz'd Al Dhum
[1:35] <Diablodoct0r> And see for yourself
[1:35] <Snowman> So, you're not like me?
[1:35] <Snowman> I am pretty cultural
[1:35] * Sliker (probably@5e07ae3d.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
[1:35] <CruelNoise> So am I, since I've come to spend much time on the internet
[1:35] <Snowman> ...
[1:35] <CruelNoise> But a year or two can only make up for... a year or two.
[1:36] <Snowman> Internet =/= Culture
[1:36] <CruelNoise> When I first came into #minecraft, i didn't know what quake was
[1:36] <CruelNoise> if that means anything to you.
[1:36] <Diablodoct0r> ...
[1:37] <Diablodoct0r> Really?
[1:37] <EmpiresBane> thyat's just sad...
[1:37] <Diablodoct0r> ^
[1:37] <CruelNoise> I agree
[1:37] <Diablodoct0r> Your speeling eroor ruined the impression though
[1:37] <Diablodoct0r> as did mine
[1:37] <EmpiresBane> stfu
[1:37] <C418> no
[1:37] <Snowman> I played Quake 2 the demo
[1:37] <C418> thats not sad
[1:37] <Snowman> A lot of times
[1:37] <C418> #minecraft is sad
[1:37] <Diablodoct0r> Yes it is
[1:37] <CruelNoise> #minecraft is my haven
[1:37] <Diablodoct0r> But it doesn't make not knowing Quake.. less sad
[1:37] <EmpiresBane> if you hate this channel so much, why are you here?
[1:37] <Snowman> Back in the days where you bought cds full of demos
[1:37] <ez> why C418
[1:38] <Marafk> yet another channel
[1:38] <CruelNoise> I love this place, and its people.
[1:38] <Marafk> there are more friendly ones
[1:38] <Marafk> even on esper
[1:38] <C418> it's just a repeating mess I can't follow
[1:38] <Snowman> I hate the Minecraft community
[1:38] <CruelNoise> I don't think C418 hates it.

[1:38] <EmpiresBane> the only time i ever see you talk, you're bashing on it
[1:38] <Diablodoct0r> INdeed
[1:38] <CruelNoise> Talking in here takes all your attention, C418.
[1:38] <C418> no it does not
[1:38] <LG_Legacy> Do tell why #minecraft is bad?
[1:38] <CruelNoise> you can't do anything else at the same time.
[1:38] <ez> how building going Marafk?
[1:39] <Marafk> ez: the host took a break recently, going back to buidling tomorrow
[1:39] <C418> I guess I can't stand lotsa people in one place
[1:39] <ez> ok will it fit lol
[1:39] <Marafk> didn't make much progress.
[1:39] <CruelNoise> C418, why don't you make a channel for your asian fanclub?
[1:39] <Diablodoct0r> Hahaha

[1:42] <mezo> <@C418> it's just a repeating mess I can't follow
[1:42] <EmpiresBane> lg did
[1:42] <mezo> is this why notch seems to avoid the place?

[1:43] <mezo> that's good
[1:43] <Diablodoct0r> I like this place
[1:43] <mezo> this channel was good the first couple weeks it was up
[1:43] <blaster> Wait... C418, how about settings to choose which music can and cannot play
[1:43] <EmpiresBane> you're like scotty in the star trek movie
[1:43] <EmpiresBane> everything goes to shit
[1:43] <mezo> now it's far past the critical mass for discussion
[1:43] <blaster> to stop the complainers complainings that its not minecrafty enough
[1:43] <C418> either all or nothing
[1:43] <EmpiresBane> "I LOVE THIS PLACE!!"
[1:43] <blaster> And just listen to the original if they want
[1:43] <Diablodoct0r> :p
[1:43] <Diablodoct0r> no blaster
[1:43] <Diablodoct0r> It takes the adventure out of it
[1:43] <Diablodoct0r> Supposed to be random and realistic
[1:44] <EmpiresBane> is the new music in?
[1:44] <Diablodoct0r> No
[1:44] <blaster> Unfortunatly no
[1:44] <C418> actually barely anyone complained about the new music being not minecrafty
[1:44] <blaster> :(
[1:44] <C418> there were shitloads of complaints with the old music
[1:44] <EmpiresBane> damn
[1:44] <Diablodoct0r> erm
[1:44] <C418> right from the start
[1:44] <EmpiresBane> i hate this current stuff....
[1:44] <Diablodoct0r> C418: What music are you talking about?
[1:44] <CruelNoise> I love all your music, C418
[1:44] <Diablodoct0r> All I know,
[1:44] <Diablodoct0r> Is that regular minecraft has soundtrack
[1:44] <Diablodoct0r> And InfDev has none
[1:44] <Diablodoct0r> right?
[1:44] <blaster> I dont like the part where it sounds like a whistle playing
[1:44] <blaster> or the techno part after that
[1:45] <C418> weird
[1:45] <Diablodoct0r> or the rock part before?
[1:45] <Diablodoct0r> or anything after?
[1:45] <C418> everytime I play people the song with the whistle in its entirety, people really like it
[1:45] <blaster> It sounds like a whistle at least
[1:45] <C418> but if I only show that part, everyone hates it
[1:45] <C418> very weird indeed
[1:45] <blaster> The 8bit one should be the theme song
[1:45] <CruelNoise> What
[1:45] <Diablodoct0r> What
[1:45] <EmpiresBane> FUCKING ALLERGIES!!!!
[1:45] <CruelNoise> Must go read minecraft music blog

[1:47] <C418> in my eyes
[1:47] <blaster> C418 the song which begins at 2:34 should be the minecraft menu theme
[1:47] <C418> you could eat some cornflakes
[1:47] <C418> cornflakes have fiber

[1:49] <ez> Griob: hi
[1:49] <ez> he's around
[1:49] <blaster> Calcium is a transition metal
[1:49] <blaster> iirc

[1:53] <Notch> I'm watching a livestream
[1:53] <EmpiresBane> did people bugging ez to bug notch finally get him on?
[1:53] <Snowman> I found a great grilled cheese sandwhich recipe the other day
[1:53] <blaster> but gammon is the best
[1:53] <Marafk> Notch: i've got just one question: WHAT is "DOHASDOSHIH!"?
[1:53] <Diablodoct0r> whose?
[1:53] <Quatroking> Notch, that fly-over you did in your new youtube vid, will that be a game feature?
[1:53] <Notch> A frustrating bug I'm trying to track down
[1:54] <Diablodoct0r> Which one?
[1:54] <blaster> ???
[1:54] <Quatroking> For spectating purposes
[1:54] <Notch> no, the fly over is slooow
[1:54] <Snowman> That world is huge though, how many MB is it?
[1:54] <Quatroking> Ah, too bad
[1:54] <Notch> it's generating new terrain almost every frame, and building all the chunks
[1:54] <copyboy> yay it's him. i wonder if he'll finally accept and enjoy his birthday present
[1:54] <blaster> Did you edit the games gravity to allow you to do that or something?
[1:54] <Shapeshiftr> Hey notch, you get my email about the level.dat?
[1:54] <Notch> i made a custom client
[1:54] <Marafk> Notch: you may want a full console error message then: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=3xWw2J5W
[1:54] <Quatroking> Also did I ever tell you the average speed I got with minecraft on my Torrentbox?
[1:54] <Notch> yes,
[1:54] * CruelNoise is now known as CruelAFK
[1:55] <Quatroking> A whole, amazing, hardcore, 0.2 FPS
[1:55] <ez> I make my own salsa sometimes, it's niiiice
[1:55] <EmpiresBane> i have got to take notch of my alert....
[1:55] <Notch> that's very few fps
[1:55] <Snowman> That's pro
[1:55] <Marafk> also, that didn't happen in offline client yet.
[1:55] <rcfighter> Heh.
[1:55] <sorre> the alt trick has been getting harder and harder to do in minecraft
[1:55] <Quatroking> It iss Notch.
[1:55] <Quatroking> It is.
[1:55] <sorre> i wonder if notch has something to dow ith that fact?
[1:55] <Kin> alt trick?
[1:55] <blaster> DOHASDOSHIH
[1:55] <Shapeshiftr> offline client is sexy.
[1:55] <Ominus> Notch the flyover could be an ingame screensaver >.> like in the menu background or as a button on the menu >.>
[1:55] <blaster> Why does it print that into the console
[1:55] <copyboy> Notch: you heard me. I've still got a birthday present for you D:
[1:55] <Shapeshiftr> I get 80% less mem usage :3
[1:55] <blaster> Thats a odd word to print
[1:55] <janger> how do i make one of these irc servers
[1:55] <Diablodoct0r> Notch: Somehow Minecraft is taking 80-100% of my entire CPU power. I have Dual Core 2.66 GHz CPU on a Dell.
[1:55] <Marafk> that's nothing
[1:55] <sorre> in a browser, pressing alt causes the applet to lose focus
[1:55] <Marafk> why are there 2 flies on my monitor
[1:55] <Miclee> Notch! :D
[1:55] <Quatroking> Diablodoct0r, dell
[1:56] <Quatroking> derrrrrp
[1:56] <Snowman> Diablodoct0r, duo core?

[1:56] <Diablodoct0r> yes
[1:56] <Shapeshiftr> Intel, I assume. Diablodoct0r
[1:56] <Shapeshiftr> mm.
[1:56] <blaster> What exactly is DOHASDOSHIH supposed to mean?
[1:56] <Diablodoct0r> yes yes
[1:56] <sorre> if you do this while input is being registered, the applet continues to register that input
[1:56] <Griob> hey notch, thanks so much for coing on IRC.
[1:56] <janger> WOW notch omg omg omg orgasm
[1:56] <Snowman> MC isn't multi core optimized yet
[1:56] <CruelAFK> So, notch, just to clear things up, does infdev work on linux now?
[1:56] <Kin> That is happening a lot with me too, its causing the input to bottleneck and stutter whenever I move (but not in minecart)
[1:56] <blaster> Did you code that message into the game?
[1:56] <CruelAFK> janger, sjut up.
[1:56] <Kin> Thats with the old infdev client though
[1:56] <vede> CruelAFK, I play infdev on Linux.
[1:56] <janger> sorry
[1:56] <Diablodoct0r> o_o
[1:56] <CruelAFK> Good, thanks.
[1:56] <Diablodoct0r> so much text
[1:56] <EmpiresBane> HOLY FUCK!!!
[1:56] <Shapeshiftr> vede, I heard the level gen didn't work on Linux.
[1:56] <CruelAFK> it wasn't working for a while there, and i wasn't sure.
[1:56] <Griob> so is /game/ just infdev?
[1:56] <Notch> so very much text!
[1:56] <vede> But CruelAFK, it never didn't work for me.
[1:57] <EmpiresBane> how is notch supposed to read this?

[2:00] <vede> Ah.
[2:00] <Quatroking> vede thats me because I'm such a rebel
[2:00] <setveen> notch, any plans on updating the current version of MP creative? with more blocks?
[2:00] <sorre> before multiplayer, i'd love to see boats
[2:00] <Notch> i have nothing in place for MP except for the old tests I did before, but I won't be using those
[2:00] <Notch> fresh start
[2:00] <EmpiresBane> minecraft would be so much funner if i could play at a steady framereate
[2:00] <Shapeshiftr> Roar. imagine all of the beeps *he* is getting from his computer right now D:
[2:00] <sorre> oceans are big as hell, and moving through them is sloooooooow
[2:00] <Ominus> Notch, could we keep the original minecarts for storage and have ridable minecarts crafted with a chair in them? :3
[2:00] <Notch> no, setveen

[2:01] <EmpiresBane> true
[2:01] <Quatroking> Oh yes, Notch, minecart engines that are controlled by players and run on coal
[2:01] <sorre> but a rowboat that lets me go at land speed over water is more than good enough
[2:01] <Griob> notch would it be possible to have some sort of in-game logic to detect when youre making a boat (out of wood) possibly with a special block. so you can have large fully custom boats?

[2:01] <EmpiresBane> but still... the jitteryness makes it a chore
[2:01] <vede> I think priority number one should be the ability to control pigs that you're riding.
[2:01] <Miclee> Notch, can you make an easy way for people to switch all their textures?
[2:02] <Notch> i could, yes
[2:02] <C418> portal 2 is more dynamic!
[2:02] <Griob> notch, what kind of customizations will there be?
[2:02] <Quatroking> Also the cart speeding glitch no longer works D:

[2:06] <Snowman> Did you jam it in an envelope and wrote Sweden on it?
[2:06] <Quatroking> Also I used pigeon mail so it was faster

[2:06] <Griob> notch, ok good. you deserve it. but you better be on irc.
[2:06] <Jat> would it be possible for us to set our own maximum ram usage for minecraft? in some future version perhaps?
[2:06] <EmpiresBane> that would be nice

[2:07] <Notch> I can't tell you what the secret is!
[2:07] <vede> Notch, what's your stance on having different mob textures for different biomes, and underground?
[2:07] <Notch> I don't know yet
[2:07] <EmpiresBane> oh my god the sales!!!!!!
[2:07] <copyboy> so you won't check it out, Notch?

[2:07] <Snowman> Quatroking, the pigeon?
[2:07] <Notch> I think I likeit, vede
[2:07] <vede> ie. cave creepers look different to arctic creepers.
[2:07] <Quatroking> snowman: he's also in the bottle
[2:07] <sorre> creepers being light brown in the desert, maybe

[2:07] <setveen> so you are abandoning my idea of hex based color cloths for MP, notch? because that would help loads in pixel art.
[2:07] <Griob> damn k
[2:07] <Miclee> Notch, increase the height limit on infinite maps
[2:08] <Quatroking> Notch: minecarts that can be driven
[2:08] <Zaneo> any elemental mobs planned?
[2:08] <Kodaichi> haha, multiple skins for the same mob is usually considered a very poor practice in game design.
[2:08] <Griob> notch why cant there be infinite hight maps?
[2:08] <EmpiresBane> dskjafhlaskdjhfkjs!!!!!!!
[2:08] <Notch> cloth is getting the EGA palette instead
[2:08] <Snowman> WE NEEDZ SPAZESJIPS
[2:08] <EmpiresBane> i need money!!!!
[2:08] <FNugget> I want to grind up flowers for dye for coloring cloths
[2:08] <Quatroking> as in, burn coal in order to create movement once the player is in it
[2:08] <Diablodoct0r> Griob
[2:08] <Kin> Miclee, totally agree
[2:08] <Diablodoct0r> I think teh reason is obvious
[2:08] <Notch> there's a bunch of reasons, griob
[2:08] <Diablodoct0r> If you add the new height..
[2:08] <Diablodoct0r> The entire map
[2:08] <Diablodoct0r> Will get the height
[2:08] <Notch> but.. I will look into it again in the future
[2:08] <Kin> Or maybe the ability to adjust parameters when generating maps
[2:08] <Diablodoct0r> Meaning, you add the entire length of the map in a layer
[2:08] <Kin> Such as the height
[2:08] <Risugami> yea I like the idea of using same code for furnace as locomotion for mine carts
[2:08] <Notch> for now, just live with 128 blocks. ;)
[2:09] <copyboy> Notch: name me date and time and i'll be online to show it off :D
[2:09] <Kodaichi> there is no vertical fog, right?
[2:09] <Griob> notch, why cant you render in cubes, and make the cubes 16*16*16 or w/e the square is now cubed.
[2:09] <Notch> there is
[2:09] <wolf_alex> oh hi notch
[2:09] <Kodaichi> oh, kqay

[2:46] <wolf_alex> called #obsidian right?
[2:46] <Jat> why do you want it open source?
[2:46] <Stik> Is anyone else's WOM client getting errors?
[2:46] <wolf_alex> jat im just saying
[2:46] <Beardbeard> Not allowed to discuss clients here, Stik.
[2:46] <Stik> Ohh
[2:46] <Stik> Sorry.
[2:46] <wolf_alex> someone will make finite water
[2:47] <Zaneo> like fClient, don't talk about that
[2:47] <Jat> that would be nice
[2:47] <Jat> i dont like the way water is now
[2:47] <Risugami> only client allowed is the official one :)
[2:47] <Stik> Well...
[2:47] <Stik> Hmm
[2:47] <wolf_alex> jat me either, it nice and all but I twitch when I use it due to how unrealistic it is
[2:48] <Jat> yeah it doesnt really act at all like water
[2:48] <Jat> it just looks like water
[2:48] <Jat> same with lava
[2:48] <Risugami> i still liked that pillar of lava falling into that lake though :P
[2:48] <Beardbeard> Current water/lava is probably as close as we're getting to real.
[2:49] <Risugami> hope to get more maps that generate those
[2:49] <Jat> i even prefer the old infinite water
[2:49] <Armonte> GUYS
[2:49] <Armonte> IN INFDEV
[2:49] <Armonte> I JUST FOUND RED CLOTH
[2:49] <vurtual> k
[2:49] <Stik> Liez
[2:49] <Armonte> no
[2:49] <Armonte> serious
[2:49] <Beardbeard> You're using a custom texture pack then.
[2:49] <Jat> tampons
[2:49] <Stik> Notch said hes adding DIES not random cloth
[2:49] <Stik> Cyes*
[2:49] <Stik> Dyes*
[2:49] <Stik> D:
[2:49] <Stik> :D
[2:49] <C418> dies?
[2:50] <Beardbeard> I wish he'd make dyes craftable from plants
[2:50] <Beardbeard> instead of flowers
[2:50] <Beardbeard> Flowers are the only resource I don't have access to underground
[2:50] <Jat> alchemy!
[2:50] <wolf_alex> YES
[2:50] <Risugami> i think "dying tub" is a funny word btw. it's a tub that dies

[2:51] <Beardbeard> He has iron and coal
[2:51] <Shapeshiftr> And even some blocks, that have pigment.
[2:51] <Risugami> hmm here's a good idea. make steel from the large iron block by putting that into the furnace
[2:52] <Beardbeard> No
[2:52] <Beardbeard> steel should be iron + coal
[2:52] <Stik> Thats too easy to make
[2:52] <Shapeshiftr> Steel is iron hardended with carbon, more of less.
[2:52] <Shapeshiftr> *or less
[2:52] <Risugami> which is technically what we have now...
[2:52] <Shapeshiftr> Coal = carbon.
[2:52] * Maart3h (Maart3h@86.92.114.65) Quit (Quit: Quitting)
[2:52] <Beardbeard> Just make steel have the same strength as iron, but the durability of diamond
[2:52] <Shapeshiftr> Yeah, the current iron looks like steel D:
[2:53] * glaxtar is now known as quaxar
[2:53] <Shapeshiftr> But it doesn't Beardbeard
[2:53] <Shapeshiftr> Steel is in no way as durable as diamond.
[2:53] <Beardbeard> That's the best he could do for balance, shape.
[2:53] <Shapeshiftr> you sure?
[2:53] <quaxar> Just make dwarfite and then have the black lung and breathable air a minecraft issue
[2:53] <Beardbeard> Man it doesn't have to be completely realistic
[2:53] <blaster> Ok... here is an odd idea for minecraft
[2:53] <Beardbeard> look at diamond
[2:53] <Shapeshiftr> Why not just make it a bit stronger and a bit more durable?
[2:53] <Beardbeard> a diamond pick/sword/shovel would snap.
[2:53] <quaxar> And there can be chambers of explosive gas in the caves
[2:53] <blaster> Collectible cards that are dropped by enemies/destroying blocks
[2:53] <quaxar> and creepers cause massive explosions
[2:53] <blaster> and you can trade them with other players
[2:53] <wolf_alex> blaster
[2:54] <wolf_alex> I like that idea
[2:54] <blaster> and some are more rare than others
[2:54] <Shapeshiftr> like half way between iron and diamond
[2:54] <Beardbeard> afaik he's only working with squared numbers
[2:54] <SireTRM> Would someone like to make me a map with a custom inventory?
[2:54] <Beardbeard> 16 32 64 128 256
[2:54] <Beardbeard> those are the numbers he works with
[2:54] <SireTRM> Powers of two.
[2:54] <blaster> and they are stored in a seperate place from your inventory
[2:54] <Beardbeard> yeah that's what I meant
[2:54] <Risugami> personally i'd rather have diamond-tipped steel picks
[2:54] <blaster> to not clog it up
[2:54] <wolf_alex> blaster
[2:54] <Shapeshiftr> blaster, minecraft is NOT turning into a trading card game
[2:54] <Shapeshiftr> NO WAY.
[2:54] <Shapeshiftr> D;
[2:54] <blaster> and are saved to your minecraft profile, not an individual save
[2:54] <wolf_alex> that idea rocks
[2:54] <Shapeshiftr> No.
[2:54] <Beardbeard> Diamond is just completely silly right now, though
[2:54] <Shapeshiftr> Nonono.
[2:54] <blaster> Shapeshiftrs the cards wont do anything
[2:55] <Beardbeard> He should just rename it to mithril
[2:55] <blaster> just be something to collect
[2:55] <Beardbeard> or adamantine

[2:55] <Beardbeard> so I don't rage every time my diamond pick doesn't snap
[2:55] <SireTRM> [Anyone want to make me a custom map?]
[2:55] <blaster> Yep
[2:55] <Shapeshiftr> not the right place..
[2:55] <Risugami> modern mining equipment uses diamond-tipped drills
[2:55] <blaster> So if you have two of the same card
[2:55] <blaster> you can swap
[2:55] <Beardbeard> Key word risu:
[2:55] <Beardbeard> DRILLS
[2:55] <Beardbeard> and they're only on the tip
[2:55] <blaster> Ok I am going to need card Ideas
[2:55] <Beardbeard> diamond is rigid and snaps with too much pressure
[2:55] <blaster> some will be more rare than others
[2:55] <Risugami> yea so, put a diamond on a pickaxe lol
[2:55] <EmpiresBane[HL2]> nothing cool is happening here
[2:55] <blaster> and each card will drop from a different thing
[2:55] <EmpiresBane[HL2]> i'm going back to HL2
[2:55] <SireTRM> Ok, I guess not.
[2:55] <Beardbeard> That'd be pointless risu
[2:56] <Beardbeard> and unless it was just a tiny part it'd still snap
[2:56] <Shapeshiftr> "hey dood, you got any creeper cards?" "no, sorry man, but I got my uber, a dragon card :3" "dood no wai! i can has"
[2:56] * EmpiresBane[HL2] is now known as EB[Anticitizen1]
[2:56] <Shapeshiftr> No...
[2:56] <Beardbeard> personally I think diamonds should just be, like, able to be inlaid in items

[2:56] <Beardbeard> to increase their power

[2:56] <Beardbeard> A diamond pick/shovel/sword would just snap
[2:56] <Beardbeard> same with armor
[2:57] <Shapeshiftr> _..._
[2:57] <Beardbeard> It's hard and strong, not rigid.
[2:57] <Shapeshiftr> baka.
[2:57] <Beardbeard> er
[2:57] <Beardbeard> I mean it is rigid
[2:57] <Beardbeard> It can't bend
[2:57] <Beardbeard> so it snaps with pressure
[2:57] <Shapeshiftr> It is the hardest and strongest material known to man.
[2:57] <Beardbeard> It's also very rigid
[2:57] <Shapeshiftr> You'd need to have a helluvah lot of pressure.
[2:57] <Beardbeard> metals are flexible to a good degree
[2:57] <Beardbeard> no not really
[2:57] * Koramei (Koramei@c-71-192-247-237.hsd1.ma.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft

[3:01] <Beardbeard> Risu, someone else brought up a point about diamond being realistic
[3:01] <wolf_alex> and just kidding
[3:01] <Beardbeard> or some shit
[3:01] <Risugami> :P
[3:01] <Beardbeard> Notch really should just rename it to mithril/adamantine
[3:01] <Shapeshiftr> I'm saying, diamond tools aren't easily broken.
[3:01] <Shapeshiftr> Cliche much?
[3:02] <Beardbeard> Only diamond drills work properly.
[3:02] <Beardbeard> and even then only on the tip.
[3:02] <Beardbeard> This is because diamond cannot be dulled, due to how hard it is.
[3:02] <SireTRM> Shapeshiftr, it's not hardness you need in a tool. You need tools that aren't brittle.
[3:02] <Shapeshiftr> hrm, this isn't worth carrying on.
[3:02] <Beardbeard> well, it can but it takes a long time.
[3:02] <SireTRM> Diamond would fracture.
[3:02] <Shapeshiftr> Still, diamond is dense.
[3:02] <vurtual> it shuold be glue
[3:02] <vurtual> glue ores
[3:02] <Beardbeard> diamond would start fracturing and then just snap right off.
[3:02] <SireTRM> Shapeshiftr, have you ever taken a piece of quartz and hit it with a hammer?
[3:03] <Beardbeard> it cannot bend at all.
[3:03] <SireTRM> Then hit a nail with the same hammer?
[3:03] <vurtual> and diamonds burn
[3:03] <SireTRM> The side of the nail
[3:03] <Shapeshiftr> yuss, but quartz isn't diamond.
[3:03] <Beardbeard> metals burn quicker than diamond
[3:03] <SireTRM> Shapeshiftr, it's similar and meant to be accessable.
[3:03] <SireTRM> Beardbeard, you'd be surprised.
[3:03] <Shapeshiftr> Diamond is the product of millions of years of carbon being compressed.
[3:03] <Beardbeard> Well, actually no, I'm not sure how diamonds would work
[3:04] <Beardbeard> they're formed from coal...
[3:04] <SireTRM> Diamond jewelery will burn out in a house fire.
[3:04] <Beardbeard> and coal burns easily..
[3:04] <Shapeshiftr> Quartz is not so.
[3:04] <Beardbeard> Diamond is rigid
[3:04] <Beardbeard> it has no flexibility at all
[3:04] <SireTRM> Shapeshiftr, it was a *simple* and *easy* comparison of different things.
[3:04] <Shapeshiftr> I guess.
[3:04] <SireTRM> Compare mineral crystals to pure metals.
[3:04] <Beardbeard> if something can't bend then it breaks under pressure
[3:05] <Shapeshiftr> But my point is, diamond is dense enough to make up for its brittle-ness
[3:05] <SireTRM> Metals are mailable enough, but still strong enough, to be used as a tool
[3:05] <Beardbeard> No
[3:05] <SireTRM> No, actually not.
[3:05] <SireTRM> Lead is denser than diamond.
[3:05] <Shapeshiftr> Wow, listen to this argument?
[3:05] <Beardbeard> for tools you need something that has both strength and enough flexibility
[3:05] <wolf_alex> come watch mah stream please and thanks, playing perfect dark irc://irc.esper.net/EB%5bAnticitizen1%5d,isnick

[3:06] <Zaneo> Diamond's strength has to do with it's structure
[3:06] <wolf_alex> right link
[3:06] <Shapeshiftr> ^^
[3:06] <Zaneo> Diamond is the same material as graphite
[3:06] <Shapeshiftr> but ok, Beardbeard
[3:06] <SireTRM> Zaneo, it's an allotrope of carbon.
[3:06] <SireTRM> It has *MUCH* different physical properties.
[3:06] <Shapeshiftr> >_<
[3:06] <Beardbeard> If diamond was a good material for tools, you'd see it much more often.
[3:06] <Beardbeard> There's a reason it's only on drills.
[3:06] <Zaneo> i know, i was illustrating a point
[3:07] <Shapeshiftr> Iron is cheaper.
[3:07] <Beardbeard> This is true, but diamond really isn't all that uncommon.
[3:07] <SireTRM> Shapeshiftr, go smash a piece of quartz for us, please?
[3:07] <Beardbeard> It's just price gouged to hell.
[3:07] <Shapeshiftr> Wait, guys
[3:07] <Shapeshiftr> Ever smashed a hammer into diamond?
[3:07] <Zaneo> You can smash quartz with a hammer lol
[3:07] <Shapeshiftr> Not even a mark.

[3:08] <Shapeshiftr> *beard
[3:08] <SireTRM> With a steel tool?
[3:08] <Beardbeard> I'd say 2-3 swings with a hammer would break a diamond easily
[3:08] <SireTRM> Because it fractures.

[3:09] <Beardbeard> actually the larger the hunk of diamond the LESS likely it'd be to snap under pressure
[3:09] <Shapeshiftr> The weight on either side of the center of gravity will break it.
[3:09] <Kodaichi> looks like someone was having fun there
[3:09] <Shapeshiftr> I mean in one direction, beard.
[3:09] <SireTRM> A diamond rod the same size as piece of glass will smash similarly under a hammer.
[3:09] <Beardbeard> yeah
[3:09] <Risugami> well yea with a hand
[3:09] <Beardbeard> glass and diamond take about the same force to smash
[3:09] <Risugami> *hammer
[3:10] <vurtual> who's been talkin' bout my "diamond rod"
[3:10] <vurtual> and getting me smashed
[3:10] <Shapeshiftr> Hurr, look up some youtube video of someone hammering diamond.

[3:15] <Risugami> hmm instead of wooden sticks... lol
[3:15] <SireTRM> Yup.
[3:15] <Beardbeard> We need magic machines that apply several hundred thousand years' worth of heat and pressure to coal
[3:15] <SireTRM> I'm pretty sure a golf club would fail at mining.
[3:15] <Beardbeard> so we can make diamonds
[3:15] <Visiiri> My dick can do that o.o
[3:15] <SireTRM> No, Beardbeard, you use a machine that deposits gaseous carbon on a microdiamond.
[3:15] <Beardbeard> that's for pansies
[3:15] <Beardbeard> I want my giant lava hammer
[3:15] <SireTRM> That's how it is done.
[3:16] <Risugami> carbon fiber holds up well on bicycles
[3:16] <Beardbeard> That's the pussy's way of doing it
[3:16] <Diablodoct0r> Or we just place some rock on your fingers and masturbate so hard that we produce diamonds
[3:16] <SireTRM> Coal is 50%-95% carbon.
[3:16] <Beardbeard> A real man makes a lava hammer and smashes to coal until it becomes diamond.

[3:17] <EmpireBane> why?

[3:21] <Visiiri> titanium has the highest strength to weight ratio
[3:21] <Visiiri> therefore it should be in Minecraft
[3:21] <Beardbeard> I can't think of any good fantasy games with titanium
[3:21] <Zaneo> of metals.?
[3:21] <Beardbeard> Mithril is a common fantasy metal
[3:21] <Visiiri> Beardbeard: There has to be a first!
[3:21] <Beardbeard> therefore it goes in minecraft
[3:22] <Visiiri> common != minecraft
[3:22] <Visiiri> therefore I win
[3:22] <vurtual> mithril is
[3:22] <vurtual> I think titanium
[3:22] <MWB> Do you count final fantasy as good fantasy games?
[3:22] <Beardbeard> minecraft is based on dwarf fortress
[3:22] <vurtual> mithril referred to some vague concept of a real metal
[3:22] <Beardbeard> dwarf fortress has common fantasy concepts
[3:22] <Beardbeard> therefore they belong in minecraft
[3:22] <EmpireBane> titanium is a real metal
[3:22] <Beardbeard> titanium is stupid and no good fantasy game uses it.
[3:22] <EmpireBane> ...
[3:22] <Beardbeard> Mithril all the way.
[3:22] <vurtual> dwarf fortress adamantine is a bizarre super-version of mithril
[3:22] <Beardbeard> Or adamantine
[3:23] <Visiiri> :|
[3:23] <MWB> Final Fantasy 7 uses both =P

[3:26] <Beardbeard> guys guys great idea
[3:27] <vurtual> both of you
[3:27] <Beardbeard> alright, let's say you find an underground lake
[3:27] <vurtual> march
[3:27] <EmpireBane> god damn
[3:27] <SireTRM> This is already bad.

[3:28] <Visiiri> pour lava on them
[3:28] <Zaneo> there can only be a limitted number of mobs

[3:28] <Beardbeard> I would get oil and pour it around the coast of my island.
[3:28] <Malikat> because the only oil i believe in

[3:41] <Beardbeard> He'd only use it so he doesn't have to constantly back it up by hand
[3:41] <Beardbeard> and so he doesn't need a spawn jail
[3:41] <Rooster> Custom servers restrict content from you
[3:41] <Kodaichi> guys
[3:41] <underd0g> I'm with Visiiri on that, kind of ruins the charm of the game when you use scripts and stuff

[3:41] <Kodaichi> why do a lot of servers have a ! prefis
[3:41] <Visiiri> Uh, Cryzed's script was GREAT
[3:41] <Kodaichi> prefix*
[3:41] <Visiiri> That had backups and stuff
[3:41] <Beardbeard> So it doesn't get buried under the other servers
[3:41] <Visiiri> it worked well
[3:41] <Beardbeard> tthat use it
[3:42] <Visiiri> but it doesn't CHANGE the server
[3:42] <SireTRM> Kodaichi, to get to the top of the server list. It's alphabetical.

[3:42] <Visiiri> oh
[3:42] <Visiiri> :P
[3:42] <Beardbeard> It can be offline
[3:42] <Beardbeard> You can play single player offline with it
[3:42] <Visiiri> it's easy to do standalone stuff
[3:43] <Risugami> so use the official one then
[3:43] <Visiiri> I've had an infdev standalone for ages
[3:43] <Beardbeard> official only works with infdev afaik
[3:43] <Beardbeard> vis is that the brocraft one
[3:43] <Visiiri> no
[3:43] <Visiiri> :|

[3:43] <Beardbeard> Good
[3:43] <Visiiri> I made it

[3:43] <Visiiri> and it works with indev, infdev, and it TRIES to work with creative
[3:43] <Beardbeard> fuck that
[3:44] <Beardbeard> but yeah, vanilla servers are kind of annoying due to the lack of restore commands
[3:44] <Visiiri> CMSS
[3:44] <Beardbeard> and because if you don't have a jail it's just griefer heaven
[3:44] <Visiiri> and call it good

[3:44] <Visiiri> and call it good

[3:45] <Risugami> uses C# i guess?
[3:45] <Shadaez> CUSTOM SERVER TALK?! BANNNNNNNNN
[3:45] <Beardbeard> you can have only one non-guest world if you really want brah
[3:45] <Visiiri> That does two things- 1. Guest world becomes unapealing. 2. It splits the people up.
[3:46] <Shadaez> Is there any Vanillin (Artificial Vanilla) servers that perform better than the default?
[3:46] <Visiiri> Shadaez: CMSS
[3:46] <Beardbeard> on my server I just make the guests builders if they make something that isn't a shitcube
[3:46] <Visiiri> It's still the vanilla server
[3:46] <Beardbeard> Does CMSS have restore?
[3:46] <Shadaez> I mean, better server performance

[3:59] <Shadaez> ff
[3:59] <vurtual> Okay, the entire course is constantly bombarded by wind that changes direction from blowing left or right, so you have to keep turning slightly left or right to not be blown into the damaging walls
[3:59] <vurtual> Also, death wind II in specific is tighter turns, and the few straightways have boosts somewhere at their start that will slam you into a wall
[4:00] <Beardbeard> Oh I thought death wind was a vehicle
[4:00] <Beardbeard> my knowledge of fzero is fading
[4:00] <Risugami> ahh well there is a course editor for MKWii. might get something like that eventually
[4:00] <Beardbeard> course editor?
[4:00] <Beardbeard> where?
[4:00] <vurtual> Where!?
[4:00] <Risugami> lemme see if I can find link
[4:00] <vurtual> I am doubly enraged at mkwii for just having the blue falcon

[4:14] <vurtual> I assure you.
[4:14] <Beardbeard> I thought the third was best
[4:14] <Beardbeard> second was pretty close though
[4:14] <Risugami> don't bother with MP2 though. boring
[4:14] <Shadaez> Prime 3 is easy, slow, and boring
[4:14] <vurtual> oh you did not say that, Risugami
[4:14] <Beardbeard> I'll agree with you on the first being the wors
[4:14] <Shadaez> 2 is the only one I havn't suffered
[4:14] <Risugami> Prime 1 was the best because it was hard

[4:21] <vurtual> No, the problem is that you are autistic.
[4:22] <vurtual> I can't make it any clearer than that, sir.
[4:22] <Beardbeard> Though I hate how team ninja gave samus that stupid mole
[4:22] <vurtual> Beardbeard
[4:22] <vurtual> that's been around since super metroid.
[4:22] <vurtual> or earlier.
[4:22] <vurtual> Just never shown.
[4:22] <Beardbeard> They better not turn her into another ninja gaiden chick
[4:22] <FNugget> Amazingly, it didnt all disappear
[4:22] <FNugget> but whatever i cant get

[4:22] <FNugget> is not trapped in obsidian
[4:22] <Beardbeard> I recall seeing both sides of samus's face throughout the prime games
[4:22] <vurtual> She's so superhuman, that the laws of physics basically ignore her now!
[4:22] <Beardbeard> never saw that mark
[4:23] <vurtual> Beardbeard, never shown until now
[4:23] <Beardbeard> IE team ninja added it
[4:23] <vurtual> er
[4:23] <Beardbeard> for no disernible reason
[4:23] <mariopro766> im bored
[4:23] <vurtual> lemme find that
[4:23] <Beardbeard> *discernible
[4:23] <vurtual> brb internets
[4:23] <Risugami> you can see Samus' face in prime. go find some bright flashes.
[4:23] <FNugget> FFFFFFFF
[4:23] <Beardbeard> I know you can see it
[4:23] <FNugget> i lost my cage spawner
[4:23] <vurtual> http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Yoshio_Sakamoto
[4:24] <vurtual> IT'S RIGHT THERE
[4:24] <vurtual> CLEAR AS CRYSTAL
[4:24] <Beardbeard> you can see it reflected in the visor and in some cutscenes
[4:24] <vurtual> super metroid developer interview :|
[4:24] <mariopro766> i want to find a room in a cave so bad >.>
[4:25] <vurtual> No really, whenever you think about what samus does in a day-to-day basis, it's kinda scary
[4:25] <vurtual> Is Tallon IV even humanly breathable?
[4:25] <vurtual> or Elysia?
[4:25] <vurtual> or that first seed you visit in prime 3?
[4:25] <Risugami> notice her power suit
[4:25] <Beardbeard> Who said that samus and the others are human?
[4:25] <vurtual> helmetless
[4:25] <vurtual> samus and all the other humans are infact human
[4:25] <vurtual> she was a human on colony K-2L
[4:25] <Beardbeard> They're humanlike
[4:25] <Beardbeard> They could be different types
[4:26] <Risugami> blame the crazy Chozo magic then
[4:26] <vurtual> it's all that chozo DNA
[4:26] <Beardbeard> types meant to breathe the air on those planets
[4:26] <Shadaez> vurtual y do u h8 me :c
[4:26] <vurtual> http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Human HUUUUMAAAN
[4:26] <Beardbeard> It's impossible for humans to be able to breathe on any other planet without equipment
[4:26] <Beardbeard> no matter how similar to earth
[4:26] <vurtual> Samus has chozo DNA
[4:26] <vurtual> so apparently that means
[4:27] <vurtual> that she can run around with a 300 pound suit without any strength enhancement and still flip around happily
[4:27] <Beardbeard> maybe she isn't the same type of human as earth humans
[4:27] <Beardbeard> hey man, how do you know it's 300 pounds
[4:27] <Shadaez> Beardbeard why not?
[4:27] <vurtual> it was in a trophy
[4:27] <Risugami> maybe she has a chozo uncle
[4:27] <vurtual> well, she's 300 pounds with the suit
[4:27] <vurtual> so... 200 or so
[4:27] <vurtual> 100
[4:27] <Beardbeard> how do you know what the gravity is on those planets?
[4:27] <vurtual> yeah, aroudn 100 pounds
[4:27] <Beardbeard> pounds only work for earth
[4:27] <vurtual> because she does the exact same thing on Earth?
[4:27] <Risugami> how massive is she? lol
[4:27] <wolf_alex> beard you just remember everything dont you/
[4:27] <vurtual> and earth-gravity ships, apparently
[4:27] <vurtual> Risugami, over 6 feet by a few inches
[4:28] <Risugami> as in mass.
[4:28] <Beardbeard> when has samus been to earth
[4:28] <Beardbeard> when
[4:28] <vurtual> other m
[4:28] <Beardbeard> holy shit really
[4:28] <vurtual> and in prime 3, she's on a human ship, which we can really really hope has earth gravity
[4:28] <vurtual> what about the part where she got that DNA infusion so she didn't become very dead on zebes? I mean
[4:28] <vurtual> "hey look, we're making it so samus can breathe fine on these crazy planets, so yeah, stop worrying about that."
[4:29] <Risugami> oh yea. forgot about that
[4:29] <Beardbeard> it's very possible that the ship has lower gravity
[4:29] <Beardbeard> due to the weight of everyone's armor
[4:29] <wolf_alex> you guys make me want to go play super metroid
[4:29] <vurtual> well gravity or not, they all have the same gravity, appraently
[4:29] <vurtual> ...now I want zero G and low G places in prime
[4:29] <wolf_alex> too bad my computer isint good enogh to emu gamecube games :(
[4:29] <vurtual> low gravity would be fun if you had places just for that
[4:29] <vurtual> ...
[4:29] <Beardbeard> that reminds me
[4:29] <Risugami> hmm samus' body is really fucked up. she has human, chozo, and metroid DNA in her lol
[4:30] <vurtual> super metroid isn't a gamecube game
[4:30] <vurtual> and you shouldn't emulate it

[4:30] <Beardbeard> fuck I forget what it reminded me of
[4:30] <Beardbeard> oh now I remember
[4:30] <Knuk> ok guys, we got a really old server
[4:30] <Beardbeard> Sonic can breathe in space
[4:30] <wolf_alex> vurt
[4:30] <Beardbeard> and mario
[4:30] <vurtual> and so can batman
[4:30] <Knuk> http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=b8ce083f0ed258f87d20864b230dc7e3
[4:30] <vurtual> and fox
[4:30] <Shadaez> Super Metroid is the best Metroid game
[4:30] <Knuk> but this server is special
[4:30] <vurtual> and in smash bros, everybody
[4:30] <wolf_alex> I meant gc emu for metroid prime
[4:30] <Knuk> you will need version 0.23 to be able to connect
[4:30] <vurtual> you said super metroid
[4:30] <wolf_alex> Ive allways waznted to play that
[4:30] <wolf_alex> yeah
[4:31] <wolf_alex> cause I can play that
[4:31] <Knuk> http://www.zuriki.net/retrocraft/
[4:31] <vurtual> buy it then
[4:31] <vurtual> and not the trilogy!
[4:31] <Knuk> take the 0.23 version
[4:31] <Knuk> and you will be able to connect
[4:31] <wolf_alex> whats wrong with the trilogy
[4:31] <Knuk> it's an oldschool server
[4:31] <vurtual> it's nerfed
[4:31] <vurtual> lots of cool effects removed
[4:31] <Knuk> server link: http://minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=b8ce083f0ed258f87d20864b230dc7e3
[4:31] <vurtual> prime 2 is much, much much much easier
[4:31] <Shadaez> "patched" imo
[4:31] <Beardbeard> trilogy could have been better but it would have cost more most likely
[4:31] <vurtual> Shadaez, except now prime 2 is ridiulously easy

[4:32] <wolf_alex> next time I see the first ill get it

[4:32] <wolf_alex> I like it
[4:32] <Risugami> i personally liked both those games
[4:32] <Beardbeard> why don't they count?
[4:32] <vurtual> WHY, I DON'T KNOW
[4:32] <wolf_alex> SUNSHINE WAS GOOD OK
[4:32] <vurtual> so, where HASN'T samus been able to breathe though?

[4:33] <Beardbeard> andrew
[4:33] <Beardbeard> motivational posters aren't funny
[4:33] <vurtual> She can breathe on Zebes, Tallon IV, Elysia, inside the phazon seed on bryyo(for a bit at least)
[4:33] <Beardbeard> they ruin the joke
[4:33] <Beardbeard> how do you know she can't just hold her breath for a long time bro
[4:33] <Knuk> waiting for you people...
[4:33] * Knuk (EquinoxTec@bas1-quebec14-1177720079.dsl.bell.ca) has left #minecraft
[4:33] <vurtual> she got the DNA to breathe on zebes in specific
[4:34] <Risugami> or what about her suit helping her breathe?
[4:34] <Beardbeard> he's talking about helmetless, risu
[4:34] <Risugami> yea what it's still attached to her body
[4:34] <vurtual> and she can use E-tanks without the suit somehow
[4:34] <Beardbeard> she eats the e tanks
[4:34] <Risugami> helmet is just part of the suit
[4:34] <Beardbeard> they're not related to her suit
[4:34] <vurtual> nom nom
[4:35] <vurtual> Risugami, are you forgetting that she went a long time without the suit, before she even had it? And she was on the planet zebes.
[4:35] <vurtual> breathing.
[4:35] <vurtual> the air, on the planet, that is normally unsafe.
[4:35] <Beardbeard> spoiler: samus's suit is made of cardboard and was for an anime cosplay convention. It's not protecting her at all.
[4:35] <Beardbeard> She just eats so many e tanks that she's unkillable.
[4:35] <vurtual> but it DOES use her upgrades
[4:35] <mezo> Beardbeard
[4:35] <mezo> good name
[4:36] <vurtual> so it's like, 100 pounds of cosplay armor, that can be upgraded.
[4:36] <Beardbeard> she makes a new cardboard suit when she gets upgrades
[4:36] <Beardbeard> to make her feel better
[4:36] <Beardbeard> man it's like
[4:36] <Beardbeard> you know how heavy chozo cardboard is?
[4:36] <Malikat> e-tank = vagisil
[4:36] <Malikat> missile upgrade = tampon
[4:36] <Diablodoct0r> I just got an update
[4:36] <Diablodoct0r> from Notch
[4:36] <Diablodoct0r> on the site
[4:36] <vurtual> then she crashes in zero mission, and goes "No way, my suit is wrecked", and feels too bad to keep using upgrades
[4:36] <Shadaez> Malikat that's offensive to females like vurtual
[4:36] <Diablodoct0r> It says, "Malikat has small tits"

[4:37] <Beardbeard> yes
[4:37] <vurtual> hauling a gigantic paper mache ship with her
[4:38] <Beardbeard> it shoots foam missiles in prime 3
[4:38] <Malikat> ship is powered by samus aran's cuntfarts
[4:38] <wolf_alex> how does whe go into the ball is what I wonder
[4:38] <Beardbeard> space pirates are allergic to foam
[4:38] <wolf_alex> noone wonder's that?
[4:38] <wolf_alex> noone?
[4:38] <vurtual> wolf_alex, it's 1 meter accross
[4:38] <vurtual> or half her height
[4:38] <Risugami> and when her ship crashes in metroid fusion, her cardboard armor gets posessed and trys to kill her
[4:38] <wolf_alex> yeah still
[4:38] <Beardbeard> the ball is half her height
[4:38] <Beardbeard> she can easily curl into it
[4:38] <vurtual> she curls up, and uses her superpowers to contort the cardboard into a ball
[4:38] <Malikat> uh
[4:38] <vurtual> then uses her powers to turn into energy
[4:38] <vurtual> BECAUSE SHE CAN
[4:38] <wolf_alex> when was the last time you tryed to curl up into a perfect ball
[4:38] <Malikat> pretty sure she is turned into like an energy thing
[4:38] <wolf_alex> lol

[5:57] <Kokopure> are you?
[5:58] <vurtual> so wait
[5:58] <NateTheGreat> yeah
[5:58] <vurtual> you can actually make yourself INVISIBLE
[5:58] <SireTRM> vurtual, since someone decided to upload a skin with transparent areas in it.
[5:58] <NateTheGreat> i am, Kokopure. And thanks for the opinion. i think that's what i'll make it
[5:58] <SireTRM> Ninja, yes.
[5:58] <Risugami> yes you can

[6:28] <Kodaichi> how about if you challenge yourself to enter a dungeon and try to find a treasure room, with a catch.
[6:28] <vurtual> I wish advance wars had more map options
[6:28] <vurtual> like special scenario stuff
[6:28] <SireTRM> That's not really possible.
[6:28] <vurtual> and more save room
[6:28] <Kodaichi> you can only ever use wood in crafting, or items you find in chests
[6:29] <Kodaichi> and coal is allowed too
[6:29] <SireTRM> You can't be sure you will find a treasure room.
[6:29] <vurtual> so I could like
[6:29] <[JD]> too bad the torch you hold in your hand isn't lit
[6:29] <vurtual> make it so it doesn't SNOW ON A TROPICAL ISLAND
[6:29] <SireTRM> So you just make a ton of wooden pickaxes and it takes forever. . .
[6:29] <vurtual> like, what?
[6:29] <Kodaichi> i mean,but, monsters!
[6:29] <Cial> wooden swords
[6:29] <[JD]> just use your wooden sticks
[6:29] <vurtual> oh boy a lightly foresty island chain
[6:29] <[JD]> like a bo staff
[6:29] <vurtual> SNOW!
[6:29] <Kodaichi> what?
[6:30] <SireTRM> I prefer my infdev as a special version of creative. . .
[6:30] <SireTRM> Peaceful all the way.
[6:30] <Kodaichi> haha, everyone loves creative
[6:30] <Kodaichi> *jazzy music plays*
[6:30] <vurtual> or even custom COs
[6:30] <SireTRM> I've got a farm area I'm going to build at some point.
[6:30] <Risugami> creative really bores me, maybe because i'm not creative
[6:30] <vurtual> ...
[6:30] <vurtual> I should make an open source clone of advance wars.
[6:30] <SireTRM> Though I would really like a custom map. . .
[6:31] <vurtual> imagine that guys
[6:31] <SireTRM> I've never played it.
[6:31] <Kodaichi> I am pretty creative, but I've exhausted my ideas with what's available
[6:31] <Risugami> i'd like that
[6:31] <Kodaichi> I don't use hacks anymore, and it's not as fun without htem
[6:31] <[JD]> i need artistic/creative input to beable to have creative output

[6:58] <mariopro766> i want to see what a room in a cave looks like
[6:58] <vurtual> the biggest, southeast island houses the most bases, and makes up the blue base, with two rivers
[6:58] <vurtual> the southwest island is smaller, has two cities, an airbase, and a port, it's south of me, and is part of my main attack plan
[6:59] <SireTRM> mariopro766, It's a mildly eliptical room with a relatively smooth ceiling and floor
[6:59] <vurtual> there's a northeast island with a city on the road, and a port. Then the northwest island, which has a city, two bases, and my HQ
[6:59] <Gilhart> wonder if he'll put elevators in minecraft
[6:59] <Risugami> we have ladders
[6:59] <SireTRM> Vertical minecart transport?

[7:15] <vurtual> in other news my neotank has finally gotten free
[7:15] <vurtual> and they're running out of army
[7:15] <Lily_White> to craft them, place three sticks horizontally next to each other

[7:18] <Lily_White> oh
[7:19] <Haggle> Yeah...
[7:19] <Haggle> I know.
[7:19] <Lily_White> what was wrong with them
[7:19] <Lily_White> ?
[7:19] <vurtual> they were hard
[7:19] <vurtual> for back in the day
[7:19] <Haggle> He disliked them in general becuase of all the problems they cause with water and shit.
[7:19] <vurtual> I just noticed there were no midway bases in this map
[7:19] <vurtual> okay here's a way to deal with water
[7:19] <Haggle> and how hard they were to code in the first place
[7:19] <vurtual> halfblock on level with water
[7:20] <vurtual> becomes a watery halfblock, water cannot flow over it, and it just looks like it has water on top

[7:22] <wry> i'm no longer on the ground...
[7:23] <vurtual> this island will serve as a great assault base on some nonexistant war
[7:23] <Lily_White> I'M SWIMMING IN A SEA OF PIGS
[7:23] <Rooster> Speaking of the ground, I should play Minecraft
[7:23] <Rooster> Lily_White post a screenshot
[7:23] <vurtual> great, their mechs have ruined my little war machines
[7:23] <vurtual> well, no matter
[7:23] <wry> what are you playing?
[7:23] <sorre> i hope the friday surprise this week is 1) boats, 2) changeable spawn point, or 3) mob spawn preventors
[7:23] <sorre> all are sorely needed
[7:23] <vurtual> It should be anti-air guns
[7:23] <vurtual> or a vehicle system
[7:24] <sorre> whatever vehicles end up being, i hope they're modular
[7:24] <Lily_White> http://img192.imageshack.us/img192/4996/pigpen.png
[7:24] <sorre> especially boats
[7:24] <Lily_White> Number is now about twice what it is in that picture
[7:24] <vurtual> So if we wanted to, we could make... tracked vehicles
[7:24] <Haggle> wry: he's playing advance wars 2.
[7:24] <vurtual> that essentially look like tanks
[7:25] <Cial> maybe the secret is elevators or something like that
[7:25] <Lily_White> I'm gonna let a few more accumulate before setting a fire
[7:25] <Lily_White> xD
[7:25] <Haggle> dats alot o' chops.
[7:25] <Haggle> I mean.
[7:25] <Haggle> Ham
[7:25] <Lily_White> yeah, I think the number is up to about a hundred
[7:25] <vurtual> I'm gonna take al lthese bases
[7:25] <Lily_White> you walk into the room and it's all HOLYSHIT I'M IN A FUCKING SEA OF BACON!
[7:25] <vurtual> brute force, woah
[7:25] <Haggle> does meat still cook if you throw it in a fire?
[7:25] <vurtual> he has two mechs, and a lander that's empty.
[7:25] <vurtual> real scary
[7:25] <Lily_White> no, it just burns
[7:25] <wry> Haggle, thanks
[7:25] <Haggle> Or was that iron..
[7:25] <Haggle> K.
[7:26] <Haggle> can you ride them like a mosh pit?
[7:26] <Cial> pigs in a mosh pit.....
[7:26] <Haggle> They are the mosh pit.
[7:26] <vurtual> mosh pigs
[7:27] <Cial> wow they let anyone into a concert now days
[7:27] <vurtual> this battle has been long, hard, and throbbing
[7:27] <vurtual> I ponder the mechanics of an APC full of supplies on a bridge giving supplies to a battleship out in the water
[7:27] <vurtual> giant mediguns?
[7:27] <Lily_White> I'd dump lava on them, but I fear that the sound of hundreds of pigs melting would crash java

[7:30] <Risugami> *can't
[7:30] * Cial starts dialing the CIA
[7:30] <vurtual> so basically a little forward base
[7:30] <vurtual> If it was my decision I'd let you store units in them
[7:31] <vurtual> victory \o/
[7:31] <Risugami> would be nice
[7:31] <vurtual> took 29 days
[7:31] <vurtual> for a small amount of islands
[7:32] <vurtual> but it had 2 airports, 3 ports, and 4 bases, along with some cities, so it's useful I guess.
[7:32] <darkedone02> notch now need to make alternative textures and more regional areas, like deserts and snows, plains and badlands. Each Area had different special thinks, like badlands has a higher chance on spawning more zombies and creatures, and digging speed has been lowered sightly.
[7:33] <Visiiri> lol shit
[7:33] <Visiiri> my ram is being whored by photoshop
[7:33] <Risugami> sounds about right
[7:33] <Cial> darkedone02, that is more or less in the plans
[7:34] <vurtual> notch shuold add builder drones to creative
[7:34] <Visiiri> fuck
[7:34] <Risugami> maybe saplings that grow on snow will become pine trees
[7:34] <vurtual> you get in their cockpit and they float around with jets
[7:34] <darkedone02> in snow, zombie spawn is higher but animal spawn is lower due to inhabitable area's, and digging speed is reduce greatly due to high temperatures, and you need to be near a heat source if you want to survive around snow or you lose health each minute
[7:34] <Visiiri> died
[7:34] <vurtual> then you enter a holographic simualtion, and can build objects
[7:34] <vurtual> then, you place those objects with the drone
[7:34] <vurtual> it automatically assembling them on spot
[7:34] <vurtual> with a block machinegun
[7:34] <darkedone02> Cial, it be great if he does this, cause it will improve the gameplay and the graphics as well...
[7:34] <vurtual> snowy areas have snow over the blocks
[7:35] <darkedone02> It helps make this less repetitive seeing just grass, gravel, stone, and sand.
[7:35] <vurtual> excessively snowy areas have no grass
[7:35] <vurtual> but snow can pile up
[7:35] <vurtual> and slows you
[7:35] <vurtual> chilling winds
[7:35] <darkedone02> aye
[7:35] <vurtual> permafrost blocks
[7:35] <Risugami> hmm snow could just be like grass, just white
[7:35] <vurtual> no no snow piling up
[7:35] <Risugami> might be a fun texture swap lol
[7:35] <vurtual> in creative, you have a snow shovel, just for adding and removing snow
[7:35] <darkedone02> also you get special blocks in caves in snowly lands.
[7:36] <Cial> creeper explosions could freeze you for x ammount of time?
[7:36] * Risugami feels liketrying that

[7:53] <abyss08> thx
[7:53] <vurtual> you mean CHEATS
[7:53] <Cial> no problem
[7:53] <Cial> vurtual, stfu
[7:53] <vurtual> That's what they are/
[7:54] <Cial> modders are people to damnit
[7:54] <vurtual> I mod things
[7:54] <vurtual> but all the custom fast-stuff is just cheating
[7:54] <Cial> to each his own vurtual
[7:54] <vurtual> I ain't one about mindin' my own business
[7:55] <Conundrumer> then you will be ignored
[7:55] <Cial> thats another problem with society today

[7:55] <vurtual> I live in the middle of nowhere, and only follow the law out of indifference nowadays.
[7:56] <Cial> oh wow such a rebel
[7:56] <Conundrumer> that's cool
[7:56] <abyss08> *sigh
[7:56] <Rooster> How do you not die when exploring new caves
[7:56] <vurtual> So don't give me any of your kiddie "society' stuff
[7:56] <Rooster> You can't see shit
[7:56] <vurtual> Rooster, wepon
[7:56] <Cial> whats wrong abyss08 ?
[7:56] <vurtual> and turn up your monitor brightness
[7:56] <Rooster> Can't
[7:56] <abyss08> that other channel isn't nearly as populated as this one is :P
[7:56] <Rooster> Moniter has fixed brightness
[7:56] <Cial> nope it isnt
[7:57] <vurtual> buy a new monitor
[7:57] <Conundrumer> that other channel isn't nearly as crappy as this one is
[7:57] <vurtual> because you have a horrible, horrible piece of garbage
[7:57] <abyss08> lol
[7:57] <Risugami> make tons of torches then
[7:57] <vurtual> I don't think I've even seen a fixed-brightness monitor before
[7:57] <Conundrumer> more trolls here
[7:57] <Cial> also if no one is active there i would suggest MCsharp abyss08
[7:57] <Rooster> What if it was 1 foot x 1 foot crystal clear HD mega hyper moniter
[7:57] <abyss08> thats what my friend is using!
[7:57] <Cial> it has diffrent settings for the physics
[7:57] <Rooster> That farted gold
[7:57] <abyss08> but it doesn't have the dying flowers :(
[7:58] <Cial> it doenst :/
[7:58] <Cial> hmm
[7:58] <vurtual> Rooster, poorly made either way
[7:58] <Rooster> BUT IT FARTS GOLD
[7:58] <Cial> sadly thats one of the best ones atm
[7:58] <vurtual> Because if you don't have a brightness control on it, then they weren't even trying to make anything decent.
[7:58] <vurtual> so they make it slightly bigger and tout it as better
[7:58] <vurtual> Is it 1080p, too?
[7:58] <Rooster> I probably just can't find it
[7:58] <Rooster> Where would I look?
[7:58] <vurtual> There are buttons on it.
[7:58] <vurtual> Find them.
[7:58] <Rooster> Oh those
[7:58] <abyss08> thanks Cial for the help :)
[7:59] <Rooster> I've got options
[7:59] <Cial> see if you can find a link for fcraft or icraft(hyve build or myne)
[7:59] <vurtual> now wait
[7:59] <Cial> i think they might do it but im not sure
[7:59] <vurtual> what's wrong with the vanilla
[7:59] <vurtual> besides your speed-building commands
[7:59] <Rooster> Size/Center , Geometry, Color, Language, Option, Reset, Help
[7:59] <vurtual> which honestly won't save you longer
[7:59] <Cial> vurtural people want to chose

[8:00] <vurtual> killed my favorite servers.
[8:00] <vurtual> Violently.
[8:00] <Cial> oh dear jesus
[8:00] <eZek0> Why is it my world4 says 3.82MB in the Minecraft menu, but when I look at it in the file explorer it says ~11MB?
[8:00] <vurtual> and brought in a bunch of impatient whiny types that I can't come up with something vulgar enough to describe.
[8:00] <Conundrumer> cail,vurtual is just trolling
[8:00] <vurtual> I am not trolling.
[8:00] <Conundrumer> *cial
[8:00] <abyss08> i bet you are the type of person who hated when wiremod came out in Garry's mod :P
[8:00] <vurtual> I am sick of those types.
[8:00] <Conundrumer> then you're being niggardly
[8:00] <Rooster> 'OH FUCK
[8:00] <Rooster> What does Degauss do
[8:00] <eZek0> Degausses things.
[8:01] <vurtual> it degausses your monitor
[8:01] <Rooster> Clever :/
[8:01] <vurtual> by firing it as a laser

[8:01] <Cial> vurtual, sadly all you are doing is bitching and doing nothing productive except support the horrible double standard that this channel has on minecraft mods and tools
[8:01] <vurtual> so you have some lame TV don't you
[8:02] <vurtual> cial, I don't play on any of these servers, I don't support them, I actively tell people not to use them, and crack down hard on them wherever I can.

[8:03] <Cial> or you could be indiffrent to the situation and not pass judgment on them based on your own bad experiences
[8:03] <Rooster> I think entitlement is the right word
[8:03] <Gunmage> ^
[8:03] <Rooster> FUCK CAVES MAN THIS IS SCARY AS SHIT
[8:03] <Rooster> It's a giant fucking cavern.
[8:03] <Rooster> I can't see shit
[8:03] <vurtual> I bet you'd like all 'dem wars to end on the spot, wouldn't you
[8:04] <Conundrumer> I still think you're a troll
[8:04] <Cial> ive had bad experiences on vanilla servers but i dont actively tell people that they are shit and to avoid them
[8:04] <vurtual> because of these hackery custom types, I've had to deal with most of my friends quitting.
[8:04] <Haggle> Rooster; the worst part is getting lost in them...
[8:04] <Haggle> and running out of torches.
[8:04] <vurtual> then others would overdo it and build gigantic solid boxes for the most minor, inconsequential production
[8:04] <vurtual> rather than being ops, the outside of the server was left in ruin.
[8:05] <vurtual> And all the good ops left.
[8:05] <Conundrumer> are custom servers to blame?
[8:05] <vurtual> servers would also be atacked just for not being their custom servers
[8:05] * AndrewPH|AFK is now known as AndrewPH
[8:05] <Cial> oh boo hoo i lost a large portion of my friends because griefers fragged our server
[8:05] <vurtual> or for still being vanilla in general
[8:05] <Cial> but guess what i moved on
[8:05] <Cial> vurtual, get better ops
[8:05] <vurtual> WE HAD THE BEST.
[8:05] <vurtual> This was back when hacks could make you unbannable, you know.
[8:05] <darkedone02> I wish there was more of a serious game for terraforming planets.

[8:06] <vurtual> cial, you couldn't ban them.
[8:06] <darkedone02> spore is too kiddy, sim earth is old...
[8:06] <vurtual> They would change their name rapidly
[8:06] <vurtual> and fly through a map, nuking it all at once.

[8:06] <vurtual> cial, public server.
[8:07] <Conundrumer> in during hack arguing
[8:07] <vurtual> and we're not privating it like idiotic scared children
[8:07] * Drule (Drule@s83-187-157-61.cust.tele2.se) has joined #minecraft
[8:07] <Cial> then deal with it and quit bitching its annoying
[8:07] <vurtual> then the troll-types of the forum finished it off by whining at the few good ops left who tried to start servers in wake of the destruction, and trolling off everyone
[8:07] <vurtual> Every time anyone starts a server, this starts again.
[8:07] <Cial> who listens to the idiots on the forums?
[8:08] <Cial> most of them type worse than me
[8:08] <vurtual> In short, arzock sucks, custom server makers are butthurt, and public servers will never be good again.
[8:08] <vurtual> and I'm sure most griefers have a vendetta against me by now.
[8:08] <Rooster> I feel your pain darkdone02
[8:08] <Cial> -_- and i wonder why i still hang out here...
[8:08] <Rooster> Oh is this debate about custom servers?
[8:08] <Cial> afk.
[8:08] <Rooster> ooo goody
[8:09] <Cial> back
[8:09] <Conundrumer> no
[8:09] <Conundrumer> more like complaining
[8:09] <Rooster> There is like a 6x6 hole I need to plug up.
[8:09] <vurtual> Rooster uses a CRT
[8:09] * Rooster doesn't know what that means
[8:09] <PuyoDead> Seeing a Steam overlay on Minecraft. Crazy.
[8:09] <eZek0> Le gasp.
[8:09] <Rooster> :O
[8:10] <Conundrumer> :|
[8:10] <Cial> first who is arzock, second you seem to be the butthurt here vurtual, and if you get some half decent ops then they will be fine
[8:10] <vurtual> half-decent?
[8:10] <vurtual> We were the best.
[8:10] <Cial> past tense man past tense
[8:10] <Conundrumer> giving up is not a good quality
[8:10] <vurtual> But then we left.
[8:11] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[8:11] <vurtual> Because honestly, once you get DDOSed a few times, and have to deal with 80% griefer bots, you get a bit unsettled.
[8:11] <vurtual> oh, and the guy who ran the machine shut the server down outside of our will.
[8:11] <vurtual> arzock is the one who was related to citricsquid back in the day
[8:11] <vurtual> and also apparently a cultist?
[8:12] <Cial> dude the server i op on gets DDOSed regularly, and also vurtural try getting a different host

[8:13] <vurtual> but nope arzock had to ruin the fun
[8:13] <vurtual> Anyone who wasn't british would get trolled to bits by him, and he'd eventually start immediately threatening people indirectly, and in general making sure nobody else played on our servers.
[8:14] <vurtual> why people let him continue, I don't know.
[8:14] <Cial> you should have banned him and went on with life
[8:14] <vurtual> he'd get someone to bring him back
[8:14] <vurtual> someone who was unaware
[8:14] <vurtual> then he'd IP ban me and start banning everyone and try to talk out of it
[8:14] <vurtual> because, lucky for him, he was real life friends with people.
[8:14] <Cial> -_- so more or less the op hierarchy was shit
[8:15] <vurtual> beyond him though, everything was nice.
[8:15] <vurtual> and people listened to me then
[8:15] <vurtual> eventually, once I didn't leave when he built gigantic ugly structures all around everything I made, he got angry and left melodramatically.

[8:16] <Pharod42> Where does the new /game/ version save it's files?
[8:16] <Cial> so more or less you are mad at one immature prick?

[8:22] <Pharod42> Yeah, it's definately not working. It still saves in /infdev/ in the temp folder?
[8:22] <vurtual> tl;dr opped server thousands of map-wiping bots who were out for us not obeying them 90% griefers joining everybody screwed over the map to retaliate and now I'm on a "grief on sight" for not shutting down for them
[8:23] <Cial> no there should be a new folder probably /game/ -_-
[8:23] <vurtual> I didn't alienate them back then.
[8:23] <vurtual> back then, people could use hacks all they wanted on our server, we didn't bother them at all.
[8:23] <Pharod42> That's what I thought, Cial, but there isn't.
[8:23] <Cial> :/ hmm not sure then Pharod42
[8:24] <vurtual> I could probably get up a server again

[8:26] <vurtual> granted, a spawnjail made sense back when you had someone joining just to smash your server every few minutes, but still
[8:26] <Cial> if you dont want to use basic server security then you have no right to bitch

[8:26] <vurtual> we didn't even use those things for half the time, we did fine.
[8:27] <vurtual> just, now whenever we do, we get snapped at by people for it
[8:27] <Cial> if some one complains about a jail 9/10 times they are a griefer
[8:27] <vurtual> I'm just not sure if I'll be able to get together all the guys again to keep the server running, hmm.
[8:27] <vurtual> cial, no, the griefers didn't mind at all
[8:27] <vurtual> they just waited, got out, and then hid
[8:28] <vurtual> then SWASTIKAS BY THE THOUSANDS
[8:28] <Haggle> lol
[8:28] <Haggle> Yeah, they don't complain
[8:28] <Cial> thats why you have ops patrol the server
[8:28] <vurtual> we did
[8:28] <vurtual> a lot.
[8:28] <vurtual> "oh hey that |||||||| guy is smashing things at supersonic speed ban him-"
[8:28] <vurtual> "No wait he's igjkgjlkjhn now"
[8:29] <vurtual> at least it wasn't like they were natural disasters before, so you had to just hide and wait for them to leave.

[8:33] <[JD]> i just tried the ham factory level - its pretty sweet =]
[8:33] <vurtual> gonna see if I can get that old map again
[8:34] <CyborgDragon> So, notch is possibly adding dragons...
[8:34] <vurtual> FRIENDLY dragons?
[8:34] <PuyoDead> Wow, impressive. minecraft.exe killed my video.
[8:34] <CyborgDragon> "In the distant future, there will be more variation such as different terrain types (desert! swamp! snow!) and settlements (goblin village! abandoned stone tower! dragon lair!)"
[8:34] <CyborgDragon> dragon lair
[8:35] <CyborgDragon> i said possibly
[8:35] <CyborgDragon> all the dragons in the dragon lairs could be dead
[8:35] <Varriount> Virtual, I am my server is proof that what you say is completely... Odd
[8:35] <PuyoDead> I wonder when/if we'll get floating islands back.
[8:35] <vurtual> Varriount, how new is your server?
[8:36] <Varriount> It's been up since Minercpp appeared
[8:36] <vurtual> so, way newer than the above events
[8:36] <Varriount> I joined minecraft in early December..

[8:37] <CyborgDragon> also guys, falling sand now suffocates you, as in, the entity that falls smoothly will suffocate you as it falls through your upper body.
[8:37] <Varriount> CyborgDragon: We hae known that
[8:37] <CyborgDragon> no varriount, this is different from before, if you read the whole sentence.
[8:38] * Varriount looks harder
[8:38] <Varriount> Oh, I see
[8:38] <CyborgDragon> before it only suffocated you when two stacked up, now even one will suffocate you very briefly as it passes through you
[8:38] * Cial (chatzilla@cpe-173-093-169-076.sc.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft

[8:39] <Cial> now where were i?
[8:40] <Cial> ah read the back logs didnt miss much
[8:40] <Varriount> You were arguin with vurtual
[8:40] <Cial> so what did wom do to you vurtual ?
[8:41] <CyborgDragon> you missed us talking about notch adding dragon lairs
[8:41] <Cial> not arguing trying to figure out his "logic"
[8:41] <Varriount> Same
[8:41] <Cial> dragons :/
[8:41] <Cial> i call BS
[8:41] <CyborgDragon> hey, notch said it, not me
[8:41] * Varriount throws another dragon into his toilet
[8:41] <CyborgDragon> he said dragon lairs, not dragons
[8:41] <Haggle> did notch release dragons?
[8:41] <CyborgDragon> the dragons could be dead for all we know
[8:41] <Varriount> Yes
[8:41] <sorre> 3D dragon's lairs?
[8:41] <CyborgDragon> "In the distant future, there will be more variation such as different terrain types (desert! swamp! snow!) and settlements (goblin village! abandoned stone tower! dragon lair!)"
[8:41] <sorre> guys...
[8:41] <sorre> the dragons are in
[8:41] <sorre> they're just up really high
[8:42] <sorre> and invisible
[8:42] <CyborgDragon> sorre
[8:42] <CyborgDragon> shut up
[8:42] <Varriount> Shh!
[8:42] <sorre> maiq.jpg
[8:42] <CyborgDragon> seriously though, "In the distant future, there will be more variation such as different terrain types (desert! swamp! snow!) and settlements (goblin village! abandoned stone tower! dragon lair!)"
[8:42] <Haggle> You have to look really hard, and squint a bit
[8:42] <CyborgDragon> notch said that in the description of his latest video
[8:42] <CyborgDragon> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NszGurDUlHc
[8:43] <Cial> hm yet another no way in hell becoming a "well maybe"
[8:43] <CyborgDragon> cial, he may not add dragons
[8:43] <Haggle> squint real hard and you just might see a dragon in that video!
[8:43] <CyborgDragon> or they may be dead
[8:43] <Cial> but yes vurtural i would like to hear the story
[8:43] <Drakkar> you guys are silly
[8:43] * CyborgDragon pulls out the branding iron
[8:43] <Drakkar> notch will add whatever he pleases
[8:43] <CyborgDragon> haggle, dont make me use this
[8:43] <Cial> and thats why i said "well maybe"
[8:44] <CyborgDragon> and i said he might not, or they might all be dead, and it'll just be layers full of treasure, tolkien style
[8:44] * Varriount puts marshmellows on CyborgDragon's branding iron
[8:44] <Cial> why is vista not using areo :/
[8:44] <wry> notch added craftable cyborg dragons
[8:44] <Cial> ok why isnt firefox using it :/
[8:44] <CyborgDragon> i would like it if he released a changelog with each update, even the small ones
[8:45] <Cial> girr damn you Bill Gates
[8:45] <CyborgDragon> ahem
[8:45] <Cial> CyborgDragon, that takes away from the secrets
[8:45] <CyborgDragon> bill gates was not CEO when vista was made
[8:45] <CyborgDragon> he retired before they made vista and 7

[8:56] <Varriount> Diamond is too hard too find
[8:56] <Varriount> And why use it, when it's so rare?
[8:56] <Haggle> So why wouldn't it be the most valuable?
[8:57] <Haggle> Tribes of players dress up there champion in all diamond armor and weaponry to reap the enemies.
[8:57] <Haggle> Then loot their castles and bases

[9:43] <spacegiraffe> Not sure what I did on IRC that was so terrible but oh well
[9:43] <Cial> :/ how many people did you piss off?
[9:43] <Sparky20> Scientists from China, the US, and Switzerland have been working for a few momnths now on new body armor made from cotton t-shirts. The process involves soaking the shirts in a boron/nickel catalyst, then heating them to over 2,000 degrees Farenheit, which turns the fibers into boron carbide, the third-strongest material on Earth.
[9:43] <Rooster> JEEEZ
[9:44] <Rooster> Warn me next time
[9:44] <Cial> is it stronger than troll flames?
[9:44] <Rooster> blocks of text are bad for my health

[9:44] <vurtual> oh noes
[9:44] <spacegiraffe> Just SMP, Miclee and that's it I think
[9:44] <vurtual> the terrerererists will troll us :(
[9:44] <vede> Rooster, that is not a block of text.
[9:44] <vede> That was two sentences.
[9:45] <vede> It's only a block of text if his client automatically splits it up into multiple messages before sending it.
[9:45] <Sparky20> The above ^ Thing that I said in minecraft.
[9:45] <spacegiraffe> um k
[9:45] <spacegiraffe> btw

[9:47] <vurtual> "John's a griefer."

[9:48] <vede> But a friend of mine came over and found one in ten minutes.
[9:48] <vurtual> "John's a griefer, dude." "If john's a griefer, then who is this dude?" "John's a griefer, john's a griefer, and so is that dude, too."

[10:06] <vurtual> that line comes from me
[10:06] <EmpiresBane> i should be the center
[10:06] <vede> The fact that your passwords are in that mass of stuff that's to be shared with your ISP, friends, family, creepy freaks on the internet, etc.

[10:08] <EmpiresBane> a paid forums?
[10:08] * Rooster WMG
[10:09] <Animator> Rooster is correct.
[10:09] <vurtual> ...
[10:09] <vurtual> now
[10:09] <vurtual> so, wait
[10:09] <Rooster> That seems a little unfair.
[10:09] <vurtual> Most of the stupid people are infact paid you know
[10:09] <Rooster> What if someone wants to know about how to buy minecraft, or if they should get it?
[10:10] <Animator> There's going to be a seperate forum section for Minecraft information and things like that.

[10:11] <vurtual> make the forums seperately cost 9 dollars to anyone new
[10:11] <Keiya> It's not MY fault coins are rare
[10:11] <Animator> It's hard to discuss Minecraft when you don't have it and can't keep up with it when you don't own it. Also, vurtual, that's probably never happening.
[10:11] * Gilhart (X73977fz1@71.91.10.224) has joined #minecraft
[10:11] <Animator> Although it could help aera...
[10:11] <vurtual> it's deflation, Keiya.
[10:11] <Rooster> Each post cost 0.99 cents
[10:11] <vurtual> coins are worth twice as much
[10:11] <Keiya> it's ONE HUNDRED COINS PER ONE UP though!
[10:12] <Keiya> It's just... not right for it to be 50!
[10:12] <Rooster> Animator, please accept my Steam Friend invite
[10:12] * Keiya is hung up on this >_<
[10:12] <Rooster> and I will give hugsg
[10:12] <Animator> I saw, but I'm going to sleep soon.
[10:12] <vurtual> Keiya, 50 coins are now worth 100 coins
[10:12] <vurtual> 1 coin is worth 2 coins
[10:12] <Rooster> Fair enough
[10:13] <Keiya> So 50 coins is also worth 200 coins. Shouldn't I get two one ups when I get 50 coins then?
[10:13] <Animator> Anyway, yeah, I'm leaning for the forums to become mostly for paid users now in the future.
[10:13] <vurtual> no, coins are just x2 in value
[10:13] <Keiya> Except it's also worth 400. 800. 1600. 3200. 6400. 12800
[10:13] <vurtual> 1 new coin is worth 2 old coins
[10:13] <vurtual> the price of 1-ups dropped sharply after everyone realized that taking a break meant they reset
[10:13] <vurtual> as well as peach adding so many
[10:13] <Keiya> vurtual: Heh... >_>
[10:14] <vurtual> then coins also went up in value
[10:14] <vurtual> ever since the economy stabilized

[10:16] <Keiya> Good.
[10:16] <Keiya> IE should be /not/ on the list
[10:16] <vede> They had to in order to settle an anti-trust action with the EU.
[10:17] <Keiya> It's a security risk for the whole world for anyone to be using it
[10:17] <vede> So how many people in the EU do you think will be confronted with a fake popup menu?
[10:17] <vurtual> ...how does it anti-trust
[10:17] <vurtual> vede, thousands, of course
[10:17] <vurtual> all of them

[10:23] <vede> Where 'criminals' is 'anyone who is in the wrong place at the wrong time'
[10:23] <Rooster> Do you want to make it easy for them?
[10:23] <vede> Because people are dicks.

[10:26] <Dezerus> Have guards in full diamond, and have a tag or something.
[10:26] <vurtual> no how about
[10:26] <vurtual> nonleathal damage
[10:26] <Rooster> I'm following the belief that "guards" would have some ya know, guarding?
[10:26] <vede> Rooster, with that system, what I can see is some guy making a land-claim flag, putting it out in the middle of nowhere, becoming a 'guard', then just waiting for someone to walk by.
[10:26] <vurtual> guards would have wooden clubs
[10:27] <Rooster> You do have a point.
[10:27] <vede> BAM handcuffs, basement, closed room.
[10:27] <Dezerus> Batons.
[10:27] <vurtual> that not only damage you, but deal stun damage
[10:27] <vurtual> which heals slooowly
[10:27] <vurtual> if it goes over your normal hp, you collapse
[10:27] <Rooster> A lot of people are talking about jails, and they haven't really explained HOW to capture them.
[10:27] <vurtual> softer armors would negate some real damage into soft damage
[10:27] <vede> If they don't kill their victim, then that person is basically stuck there. They could leave and come back, but I assume that their position would be saved, so they'd just be back in the freak's basement.
[10:27] <vurtual> freak?
[10:28] <vurtual> as in
[10:28] <Dezerus> Handcuffs... Minecarts?
[10:28] <vurtual> pedophile-type?

[10:28] <vurtual> rape suggestion hurr
[10:28] <vede> The victim is stuck, can't call for help, can't escape, can't do anything.
[10:28] <vurtual> like daggerfall, Rooster
[10:28] <vurtual> if they dont' come quietly, cut 'em down
[10:28] <Rooster> never heard of it
[10:28] <Dezerus> Hmm...
[10:29] <Dezerus> Suicide?
[10:29] <vurtual> ...
[10:29] <vurtual> DAGGERFALL
[10:29] <vede> Rooster, yes, that's the best option.
[10:29] <Rooster> Vurtual, I doubt anyone is going to go queitly
[10:29] <vurtual> yeah, and then you die.
[10:29] <vurtual> and lose everything.
[10:29] <Dezerus> Depends on the person...
[10:29] <Rooster> Considering we all run at the exact same pace, it's going to be hard to catch them.
[10:29] <vede> Rooster, in Minecraft, DYING would be a lot more fun than being locked up and forced not to play the game for however long the guards/kidnappers feel like keeping you.
[10:29] <vurtual> arrows
[10:30] <Dezerus> If you're in a dude's basement... Your stuff is the last thing on your mind.
[10:30] <Rooster> That's the problem I keep coming back to, we only have two ways of attacking.
[10:30] <vurtual> see me yelling about combat mod
[10:30] <vede> Rooster, Minedudes do move on a flat plane at the same pace, but with different terrain, it's very possible for one person to be slower than another.
[10:30] <Rooster> Fine vede, the thread is gone, are you happy

[10:32] <Rooster> I don't see how else to contain someone.
[10:32] <vurtual> threats
[10:32] <vurtual> humping them to places
[10:32] <vede> Rooster, you don't.
[10:32] <vurtual> nonlethal damage
[10:32] <Rooster> I want it to be easier to capture than kill
[10:32] <vede> Being contained in Minecraft would suck cocks and be the least fun thing ever.

[10:34] <vede> If someone can come along and say "HEY! YOU BROKE DEM LAWZ!" and make it so all you're allowed to do in the game that you're supposed to be having fun in is run into a wall, it's bad.

[10:35] <Rooster> they rhyme

[10:39] <vurtual> yeah you break out

[10:41] <Rooster> I'm trying to solve the problems of Minecraft.
[10:41] <Rooster> It's fucking impossible with you people.
[10:41] <Scelestic> Rooster. your annoying..
[10:41] <Scelestic> Plain and simple.
[10:41] <vede> You can either put someone in a place they can escape from in a couple minutes, or you can put someone in a place where they can either have zero fun, or they can kill themselves, in which case it would have been much easier to just kill them straight away.
[10:41] <vede> Rooster, seriously, stop acting like we're trying to call you stupid and whatever else.

[10:43] <vede> Rooster, what?
[10:43] <vede> "Trying ignoring some things."
[10:43] <vede> No sense made.
[10:43] <Rooster> fuck I'm tired
[10:43] <Rooster> Everyone is ignoring things in Minecraft
[10:43] <CyborgDragon> i think he's talking about how he thinks the PvP in multiplayer will ruin it.
[10:44] <Rooster> Basically
[10:44] <vede> Rooster, it's not a problem that people are allowed to have fun in Minecraft.
[10:44] <Rooster> I've already had this conversation with CyborgDragon. It wasn't pretty
[10:44] <CyborgDragon> Look Rooster, I told you, yes it will suck at first, it will be improved though, but it won't ruin it.
[10:44] <vede> What you are suggesting is a way to remove the game from the game.
[10:44] <Conundrumer> anyone ever seen a dodecahedron in minecraft?
[10:44] <CyborgDragon> no...
[10:45] <CyborgDragon> but it'd be awesome to see one
[10:45] <vede> Rooster, really, dying isn't that bad in Minecraft.
[10:45] <CyborgDragon> and also, notch will most likely implement a spawn point changing system before he releases SMP
[10:46] <Shadaez> I LOVE STEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM
[10:46] <Conundrumer> http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/2237/07012010024542.png
[10:46] <Rooster> Oh Scelestic , you want to know why I'm annoying?
[10:46] <Keiya> Oh wait
[10:46] <Conundrumer> k done
[10:46] <Keiya> I need to add Minecraft to Steam
[10:46] <Shadaez> Notch needs to add Minecraft to Steam
[10:46] <Shadaez> and give us keys to use to claim it
[10:46] <Rooster> No he doesn't
[10:47] <Scelestic> well really. I think everyone releases SMP will suck on some level with greifers and etc. But judging from this IRC room, atleast a good 80% of the people who will be playing SMP are friendly, and just want to have fun.. So pretty much i wouldnt hesitate to guess that people just have a wait and see attitude about it at this point..
[10:47] <Shadaez> he's mailed a person from Steam before to see if he could
[10:47] <CyborgDragon> also, it's called steam shortcuts, shadaez
[10:47] <Shadaez> it's called third-party games
[10:47] <Keiya> CyborgDragon: Butbut fancy backgroundy thing
[10:47] <Fiskie> It would be nice to see him actually release Minecraft through steam though
[10:47] <Keiya> Also maybe achievements >_>
[10:47] <Keiya> "die."
[10:47] <Keiya> That would be a fun one
[10:47] <CyborgDragon> i dont want no silly achievements "survived the first night"
[10:47] <Fiskie> Oh boy
[10:48] <Rooster> Scelestic, I have the theory that most people want to have fun.
[10:48] <Fiskie> Make a respawn achievement too!11
[10:48] <CyborgDragon> if we get achievements, they better be hardcore achievements.
[10:48] <Rooster> By doing that, they are going to want to kill people.
[10:48] <Shadaez> Scelestic I don't care if people are murderers or not, as long as they aren't dbags
[10:48] <Fiskie> Servers with no friendly fire
[10:48] <Keiya> "Survive being in the water for 40 days and 40 nights"
[10:48] <Fiskie> Solved
[10:48] <CyborgDragon> like finding and crafting a full set of diamond armor.
[10:48] <Rooster> It's not the people in this IRC I'm worried about, it's the mass of children.
[10:48] <Rooster> Also Scelestic, get an easier to spell name
[10:49] <CyborgDragon> rooster, lrn2tab

[10:50] <yoshibot> hmm. what if a minecraft-esque text adventure game were to make it into the demake compo?
[10:50] <Rooster> Cool funfact Infdev spell checked in firefox is "infidel"
[10:50] <Scelestic> lolol..
[10:50] <CyborgDragon> lol
[10:51] <CyborgDragon> infidel
[10:51] <CyborgDragon> yep, he's right
[10:51] * Rooster beast
[10:51] <CyborgDragon> btw, ppl keep telling me to get mIRC, but I don't want to pay for it, and I really don't feel like torrenting atm.
[10:51] <Rooster> If minecraft SMP does turn out to be shit the whole time, I will be right.
[10:51] * CyborgDragon uses chatzilla atm
[10:51] <Rooster> But luckily that won't happen
[10:52] <CyborgDragon> rooster, i said the PvP will suck at first, but notch will improve it most likely
[10:52] <Rooster> Bleg
[10:52] <CyborgDragon> and that even if PvP sucks, it wont kill of SMP before it gets started
[10:52] <CyborgDragon> also, guys, if you meet chesse20 on the first SMP server
[10:52] <CyborgDragon> murder him, repeatedly
[10:52] <Rooster> I guess I'll wait and see.
[10:53] <CyborgDragon> or he will murder you like he did to people in blockland
[10:53] <vede> Scelestic, this channel is about as far from a good representation of Minecraft's player base as you can possibly get.
[10:53] <CyborgDragon> no seriously, he said he murdered people nonstop in blockland, -.-
[10:53] <Rooster> nother funfact, I was temp-banned because I called cheesse20 a retard
[10:53] <CyborgDragon> well chesse20 finally got permabanned for too much trolling+retardism
[10:53] <Rooster> Really?
[10:53] <CyborgDragon> yeh
[10:54] <Rooster> I didn't like how mods defended him.
[10:54] <CyborgDragon> animator was the one who did it
[10:54] * Rooster high fives Animator
[10:54] <vede> I never even noticed any of the guy's posts.
[10:54] <CyborgDragon> and they didnt defend him, they were just telling the others to stop, because it was getting to be too much
[10:54] <vede> It was fucking annoying seeing "Chesse20 is a retard!" every other post, though.
[10:54] <CyborgDragon> and that banning him because the others couldnt behave wasn't right
[10:55] <Scelestic> Thats true vede.. but 23k have bought Minecraft and 5.1k in here now.. so like 1/4 - 1/5 of the player base isnt bad to base an opinion off of.. although i see ALOT more people in here, than i have ever seen talking..
[10:55] <Conundrumer> what is this drama about now
[10:55] <CyborgDragon> but then chesse20 started provoking others when they replied to his posts.
[10:55] <CyborgDragon> aka he started trolling
[10:55] <Rooster> It was also annoying when chesse20 got no smack for making dumb ideas.
[10:55] <vede> Scelestic, this is NOT 1/5 of the player base.
[10:55] <vede> There's 154 people here right now.
[10:56] <Scelestic> lolol. Ok i feel stupid >.> Looking at the wrong.. #..

[10:58] <CyborgDragon> never said it didnt
[10:58] <Rooster> It lets me talk, that's all I really need.
[10:58] <vede> I know.
[10:58] <CyborgDragon> i just stated the ones i know to allow it

[10:58] <vede> CyborgDragon, seriously, I never said you said it didn't.
[10:58] <CyborgDragon> you implied by directing that comment at me.
[10:58] <vede> No, CyborgDragon.
[10:59] <vede> I was just adding to the list.

[11:06] <vurtual> I don't like spider pictures
[11:06] <vurtual> how big is the picture
[11:06] <vede> You're a pussy. Jeez.
[11:06] <vede> 477x358
[11:06] <CyborgDragon> vede, it's called arachnophobia
[11:07] <CyborgDragon> for some it can be so severe they cant even look at pictures
[11:07] <vurtual> backwards for me
[11:07] <vurtual> I can look at normal spiders without being scared-scared
[11:07] <vurtual> I generally think "I should deal with this"
[11:07] <vurtual> and feel better leaving the area generally
[11:07] <vurtual> but pictures? no way
[11:07] <vurtual> especially not zoomed in ones
[11:07] <Keiya> Best thing about being awake opposite most of the house: I can get away with playing Wii Fit in nothing but my underwear :P
[11:08] <vede> That's not a scary picture, vurtual.
[11:08] <vurtual> is to me
[11:08] <vurtual> the spider looked like that, but not that vibrant
[11:08] <vede> This is a scary goddamn picture: http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy3203/EyePhysio/Wolf_Spider.jpg
[11:08] <vurtual> I can't even look at d'aww jumping spiders
[11:08] <Scelestic> Holy.. fuck.
[11:08] <vurtual> in my mind? Fine.
[11:08] <vede> vurtual, they're more dull when they're young. Also smaller.
[11:08] <Scelestic> Damnit. shouldnt have looked at taht.
[11:08] <vurtual> so, can they get fist-sized?
[11:08] <vurtual> er, hand sized
[11:08] <vurtual> w/ legs
[11:08] <Keiya> I thought you meant that me playing Wii Fit in my underwear was a scary picture for a moment. (Which it is, but it's not nice to say that.)
[11:09] <vede> vurtual, they could be the size of a small child's hand, yeah.
[11:09] <vede> Why so specific?
[11:09] <vurtual> no as in, full grown hand
[11:09] <vurtual> it.. looked a bit like that
[11:09] <vurtual> but shorter legs
[11:09] <vede> Then no, not really.
[11:09] <vurtual> and didn't seem definedly white
[11:09] <Marafk> infinite mario bros time
[11:10] <vurtual> it was gray-fuzzy
[11:10] * Marafk is now known as Marach
[11:10] <CyborgDragon> ello marach
[11:10] <vede> vurtual, in your area, almost definitely a wolf spider.
[11:10] <Marach> hi
[11:10] <vede> Hell, in most areas almost definitely a wolf spider.
[11:10] <vurtual> infact it was just CALLED a wolf spider
[11:10] <vurtual> they think yellow-markeds piders are black widows
[11:10] <PyroPyro> wolf spider.
[11:10] <Marach> http://www.mojang.com/notch/mario/index.html

[11:11] <Marach> it works for me.
[11:11] <CyborgDragon> that's because it requires java 5.0
[11:11] <Marach> try the flash version somewhere
[11:11] <Marach> CyborgDragon: newest is 6-xomething
[11:11] <CyborgDragon> notch never made a flash version, unless he just updated it today
[11:11] <Marach> lol
[11:12] <Marach> CyborgDragon: people ported it
[11:12] <Keiya> Marach: It runs, but clicking does nothing :<
[11:12] <Marach> Keiya: press S
[11:12] <CyborgDragon> i tried playing it yesterday, it said requires java 5
[11:12] <Marach> CyborgDragon: it's an old version, java is backwards=compatible
[11:12] <Keiya> Marach: It doesn't work.
[11:12] <CyborgDragon> not all the time marach
[11:12] <vede> Wolf spiders can look really different from each other, but in the American midwest at least, the first image I linked is the most common.
[11:12] <CyborgDragon> notch himself said that it's broken in java 6...
[11:12] <vede> And they're really common.
[11:12] <Keiya> Pressing S just causes it to go ding
[11:12] <vurtual> yeah I know
[11:12] <vurtual> I still remember that big one
[11:12] <vurtual> which...
[11:12] <vurtual> I think it was hit with a hammer
[11:12] <vurtual> like, a sledgehammer
[11:13] <vurtual> or maybe my dad punched it
[11:13] <vurtual> he's hardcore like that
[11:13] <CyborgDragon> marach, are you sure you have the latest java?
[11:13] <CyborgDragon> maybe thats why infdev hates you
[11:13] <Marach> try a different browser, it didn't work for me in firefox
[11:13] <CyborgDragon> and i did marach
[11:13] <Keiya> Marach: /me tries chrome
[11:13] <CyborgDragon> i tried both chrome and ie8, the latter of which make me sick to even open
[11:14] <Marach> it's all working in safari :/
[11:14] <Keiya> Anyway, older versions of Java don't run applets anymore
[11:14] <Marach> well, i can stream it :D
[11:14] <Sparky20> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard
[11:14] <CyborgDragon> Mooooooooooooooooooo.
[11:14] <Sparky20> Minecraft needs this
[11:14] <Marach> Sparky20: begins on 3rd world
[11:14] <Keiya> Because sun only just got around to using the same API as EVERY OTHER FUCKING PLUGIN EVER instead of demanding special treatment
[11:14] <Sparky20> It would stop greifers.

[11:15] <CyborgDragon> no, if it gets nintendo hard
[11:15] <vurtual> if my dad can punch it, he punches it
[11:15] <CyborgDragon> i will love notch forever
[11:15] <vurtual> venomous or not
[11:15] <vurtual> he punches bees out of the air
[11:15] <CyborgDragon> nintendo hard is the best hard ever.
[11:15] <vurtual> if he can't, he generally shoots it
[11:16] <CyborgDragon> too bad nintendo's latest games dont meet their own standards of nintendo hard

[11:17] <vurtual> using a spawner
[11:17] <vurtual> sup dawg I heard you didn'tl ike spiders

[13:24] <Shadaez> Cintiq lol no
[13:24] <CyborgDragon> kid icarus wont be a rehash

[13:36] <CyborgDragon> japanese version
[13:36] <Demki> how is it implied?
[13:36] <CyborgDragon> and in the english version all the sages, excluding rauru are standing where the owl stood at the end
[13:37] <visiON_> sage
[13:37] <CyborgDragon> plus all kaepora's face looks like rauru sometimes
[13:38] <CyborgDragon> also,
[13:38] <CyborgDragon> I'm currently listening to Dancer.
[13:38] <CyborgDragon> Dancer's theme!
[13:38] <visiON_> Headhunterz!
[13:38] <Demki> Anyways, he's a bitch.
[13:38] <CyborgDragon> from majora's mask
[13:39] <Demki> I was never able to fully understand that owl tho.
[13:39] <Sparky20> The GE M134 Minigun Fires up to 6,000 rounds per minute and fires 7.62 NATO rounds. So IF THIS gun is firing 10,000 rounds per minute, it is firing ~166 rounds per minute.
[13:39] <Sparky20> Depending on where you get your ammo the 7.62 NATO round costs vary widely??? in price, I found one surplus vendor online offering 1000 rounds for $220. (I don't know if I trust the site, but I will use it as an example.)
[13:39] <Sparky20> Thus:
[13:39] <Sparky20> 200/1000=.2x166 = $33.20 per second.
[13:39] <Sparky20> sorre, 33.20x12 = $398.40 Falls VERY short of $400,000 for 12 sec

[13:45] <Demki> that will demake it XD
[13:45] <Keiya> 1d minecraft!

[13:45] <Demki> you can't see anything that is 1d
[13:45] <CyborgDragon> demki
[13:45] <Keiya> Well
[13:45] <Keiya> You
[13:45] <CyborgDragon> lines
[13:45] <Demki> line isn't 1d
[13:45] <CyborgDragon> 1d is a straight line
[13:45] <Keiya> would have to draw it using two dimensions
[13:46] <Demki> if you can see it
[13:46] <CyborgDragon> 0d is a point
[13:46] <Keiya> But gameplay could be 1d
[13:46] <Demki> if you can see a line, it isn't 1d
[13:46] <Keiya> Much like how minecraft is a 3d game
[13:46] <Keiya> but is drawn in 2d
[13:46] <visiON_> line is 2d
[13:46] <visiON_> derp
[13:46] <visiON_> you know what
[13:46] <visiON_> I'ma do the 2d minecraft
[13:46] <CyborgDragon> demki, infinitesimally small lines are 1d
[13:46] <visiON_> and draw using winapi
[13:46] <Keiya> A line is 1d
[13:46] <Keiya> The representation of a line, not so much
[13:46] <Demki> no, lines with 0 width are 1d
[13:47] <Keiya> but a line \itself is
[13:47] <Keiya> Demki: Um
[13:47] <Keiya> Lines don't have width
[13:47] <CyborgDragon> demki quit arguing semantics damn it
[13:47] <Keiya> Have you EVER studied geometry?
[13:47] <Demki> 0 width = no width
[13:47] <Demki> =|
[13:47] <CyborgDragon> LINES ARE 1d, but the representation of a line is not
[13:47] <Keiya> You might as well say it's 3d
[13:47] <CyborgDragon> in fact, the representation of even 2d things are actually 3d
[13:48] <Demki> I know that.
[13:48] <Keiya> because the graphite or ink on the page has depth
[13:48] * PyroPyro the game
[13:48] <Shadaez> no
[13:48] <Demki> even the page has depth
[13:48] <CyborgDragon> or the photons that make up the light
[13:48] <Shadaez> they're actually 5d
[13:48] <Shadaez> duh
[13:48] <Shadaez> because they exist in time
[13:48] <Shadaez> dun nerds
[13:48] <Demki> shadaez, their infD

[13:50] <visiON_> how do they work
[13:51] <Slam> i dont know
[13:51] <Demki> also, skeleton vs skeleton is epic
[13:51] <C418> battle music does not work nevertheless
[13:51] <Slam> im trying to level out this ppool of lava
[13:51] <Slam> and ive put like 8 buckets in
[13:51] <Slam> and noithing has levelled out
[13:51] <visiON_> Hey guys, what if we keep bugging C418
[13:51] <Demki> I don't need a battle music

[13:51] <visiON_> :(
[13:51] <visiON_> NOOO
[13:51] <Demki> but for some reason, even with the music option on(on the latest version), I get no music
[13:52] <Dman757> Sample?
[13:52] <Demki> C418, in MP, battles will be epic
[13:52] <Dman757> Might.
[13:52] <Demki> if you could see what ppl hold and when they use them
[13:52] <Demki> XD
[13:52] <zeroZshadow> Demki, so much lava !
[13:53] <Demki> in MP, you must be able to see what ppl hold, otherwise, you can't trust anyone.
[13:53] <Dman757> I see people just spamming lava
[13:53] <Slam> im holding 3 aces.
[13:53] <zeroZshadow> is that a shovel in your hand, or are you just happy to see me ?

[13:56] <visiON_> im C++ jnky
[13:56] <gdude2002|away> I need to get stuff from cin and I can't work out what type of variable to use
[13:56] <Demki> but that's only because I haven't seen one.

[13:56] <Marach> gdude2002|away: code
[13:56] <gdude2002|away> shit, must it be char?

[13:57] <gdude2002|away> then how do I do um
[13:57] <Demki> =|
[13:57] <gdude2002|away> str = "stuff" ?
[13:57] <gdude2002|away> is it like
[13:57] <gdude2002|away> if (str = "shit")

[13:58] <vurtual> ...works for me
[13:58] <BadSol> hey guys
[13:58] <BadSol> i just figure out how to join irc chat ._.
[13:58] <visiON_> Hey you
[13:58] <Demki> if((a=b)==b)
[13:58] <Demki> :D
[13:58] <vurtual> herro
[13:58] <visiON_> it returns true
[13:58] <gdude2002|away> lolwtf
[13:58] <visiON_> derp
[13:58] <visiON_> a is now b
[13:58] <gdude2002|away> if (input = "a") {
[13:58] <Slam> what is IRC

[13:59] <BadSol> so notch still is live streaming?
[13:59] <visiON_> if a is b
[13:59] <visiON_> it is
[13:59] <Demki> if B=NaN?
[13:59] <Slam> WHT AM I
[13:59] <visiON_> GDUDE
[13:59] <visiON_> WTF DID I TOLD YOU
[13:59] <visiON_> a==b
[13:59] <visiON_> not a=b
[13:59] <gdude2002|away> I wasn't listening lol
[13:59] <gdude2002|away> mk
[13:59] <visiON_> :)
[13:59] <gdude2002|away> alright
[13:59] <vurtual> so, if (nummer one=nummer two) is equal to nummer two
[13:59] <gdude2002|away> that worked, ish
[13:59] <gdude2002|away> No errors, but the if failed
[14:00] <vurtual> meaning, either nummer one and nummer two are 1
[14:00] <visiON_> lol
[14:00] <visiON_> thats why
[14:00] <Demki> if(NaN==NaN)
[14:00] <visiON_> you need compare
[14:00] <vurtual> or one is any number, and two is zero
[14:00] <visiON_> google it
[14:00] <visiON_> C++ string compare
[14:00] <gdude2002|away> hmk
[14:00] <visiON_> #define NaN 0
[14:00] <Demki> 0 isn't NaN
[14:00] <gdude2002|away> what, string::compare ?
[14:00] <Demki> NaN is something like 1/0
[14:00] <visiON_> wait
[14:00] <Cintiq> nan = not available
[14:00] <visiON_> nan = not a number
[14:00] <Cintiq> trollgrin.png
[14:01] <Demki> 0 is a Number
[14:01] <Cintiq> 0 is not
[14:01] <gdude2002|away> strcmp..
[14:01] <Cintiq> 0 is a placeholder.

[14:55] <CyborgDragon> the crowd
[14:55] <Marach> CyborgDragon: i started to play it right now

[14:55] <CyborgDragon> yes it is
[14:55] <CruelNoise> Steam has finished downloading Counter-Strike: Source.
[14:55] <Marach> Keiya: well, true. on project64 it was flickering like crazy
[14:55] <CruelNoise> yay
[14:55] <CyborgDragon> marach, you used the crappy default plugin didnt you?
[14:56] <Marach> CyborgDragon: i tried all of them
[14:56] <CyborgDragon> ...
[14:56] <Marach> if one fixed flickering, it had 2 other problems
[14:56] <CyborgDragon> i got it to play without any flickering at all use glide64
[14:56] <Marach> well, too late, i completed it
[14:56] <Keiya> That might have ben Project64
[14:56] <CyborgDragon> and no lag or other problems

[15:07] <CyborgDragon> they arent putting the NES games on the VC
[15:08] <sorre> i hope to god that the person who made this forum thread is trolling
[15:08] <CyborgDragon> they're giving them updated graphics, like Castlevania Rebirth
[15:08] <Keiya> But...
[15:08] <Keiya> I have NES games on VC.
[15:08] <Shrub> same
[15:08] <Keiya> Several of them
[15:08] <CyborgDragon> not all of them anyways, just a few
[15:08] <Keiya> SMB of course.
[15:08] <CyborgDragon> they're rebirthing others
[15:08] <Keiya> They should probably have just included that on the console
[15:08] <Keiya> Seriously
[15:09] <Keiya> It's probably only behind Wii Sports for % of wiis that have it
[15:10] <vurtual> lots of NES games are on there
[15:10] <vurtual> and lots are also remade
[15:10] <vurtual> ahahaha

[15:10] <Keiya> They probably could pull off Duck Hunt too
[15:11] <Shrub> duck hunt rawks
[15:11] <Keiya> It'd require some extra work (Get the coords, translate to screenposition, grab the color there, feed it to the game) but is doable
[15:11] <vurtual> ikura is that one sushi in that sushi game on pokemon stadium that was orange and then the red one was the best for points
[15:11] <Keiya> Or something.
[15:11] <vurtual> ...wait
[15:11] <vurtual> is duck hunt already released or not?

[15:51] <vurtual> tiny, tiny nukes
[15:51] <Asmageddon> Do you imagine what would happen if all the radioactive materials on earth were gathered and processed into one big nuclear bomb?
[15:52] <bildramer> yes
[15:52] <vurtual> Asmageddon, it could blow up Earth.
[15:52] <bildramer> no
[15:52] <Asmageddon> Current best nuclear bombs are usually 2-stage
[15:52] <Shrub> Nothing because that wouldn't happen
[15:52] <bildramer> it could merely scratch Earth
[15:52] <Asmageddon> 3-stage is 10x more powerfull
[15:52] <bildramer> it could probably kill everything alive
[15:52] <vurtual> it's over 8000 stage?
[15:52] <Bomb_Spammer> Once a convenitonal nuclear bomb reaches a certain mass, any more material added to it is a process of diminishing returns
[15:52] <Asmageddon> if you'd create largest possible bomb from thousands tons of uranium, like ~7-stage one
[15:52] <Bomb_Spammer> There's a reason countries make lots of nukes instead of one big one
[15:52] <Asmageddon> you could vaporize the moon, probably
[15:52] <Bomb_Spammer> Hydrogen bombs are where it's at
[15:52] <bildramer> hahahahahaha
[15:52] <vurtual> That's... OVER LIKE
[15:52] <Asmageddon> or at least make it fly faaaar away
[15:52] <zeroZshadow> >_>
[15:52] <vurtual> 7 DIGITS TIMES
[15:53] <bildramer> you can't harm planets with nukes
[15:53] <bildramer> it's like touching them
[15:53] <Shrub> Neutron Bombs ftw
[15:53] <vurtual> ...that's a million times more powerful man
[15:53] <bildramer> um
[15:53] <vurtual> at least.
[15:53] <vurtual> or ten million man
[15:53] <bildramer> why, are nukes log10?
[15:53] <Perry> Neutrom bombs only kill
[15:53] <Shrub> Exactly
[15:53] <Perry> they have very few power
[15:53] <vurtual> neutnom bombs only eat
[15:53] <bildramer> it would only be 7 times as powerful
[15:53] <Shrub> So it can be all like
[15:53] <Shrub> Pripyet
[15:53] <Bomb_Spammer> Fuck that
[15:53] <Shrub> except everywhere
[15:53] <Perry> Just loads of lethal radiation
[15:53] <Bomb_Spammer> Neutronium slug
[15:53] <Asmageddon> 3-stage russian Tzar bomb blew windows in radius of 1000km's
[15:53] <Bomb_Spammer> Shoot into centre of planet
[15:53] <Bomb_Spammer> Anti neutronium slug fired along the same path a moment later
[15:53] <zeroZshadow> you guys switch topics SO FAST
[15:53] <bildramer> blew windows
[15:53] <Asmageddon> if each next one is 10x more powerfull.....
[15:53] <Bomb_Spammer> Kaboom
[15:54] <bildramer> hahaha
[15:54] <zeroZshadow> you could be working for the newspapers
[15:54] <Shrub> "Neutronium"
[15:54] <Shrub> wut
[15:54] <Bomb_Spammer> Is that not the spelling?
[15:54] <bildramer> so

[15:54] <Bomb_Spammer> Well not now
[15:54] <Asmageddon> Heh, talking and thinging about such things, even if you have no idea - is cool :>
[15:54] <Tukiko> You can blow up neither Earth nor the moon with any amount of uranium we have here. If I remember correctly we'd need an 85 mile diameter chunk of uranium to do so. :P
[15:54] <Bomb_Spammer> At least not naturally
[15:54] <Shrub> Depends if you're talking about Newtonium or not O.o
[15:54] <Perry> FAIL
[15:54] <bildramer> think*
[15:54] <Perry> LOL
[15:54] <bildramer> well
[15:54] <Bomb_Spammer> Neutronium is hypothetical matter where all the space is removed from each atom
[15:54] <Bomb_Spammer> Unbelievably dense
[15:54] <bildramer> um
[15:55] <Shrub> Interesting
[15:55] <bildramer> wut
[15:55] * bildramer smells scifi
[15:55] <Tukiko> Also yeah I'm slow on the typing, was busy with something. :V
[15:55] <Perry> Derp.
[15:55] <Bomb_Spammer> I believe we could technically do it but it would be so retarded and unfeasible
[15:55] <zeroZshadow> 1* inf == 2 * inf so 1 == 2 <-- go break your heads
[15:55] <Bomb_Spammer> Like how we can technically convert elements into other elements
[15:55] <Bomb_Spammer> But we don't
[15:55] <Tukiko> Infinity is a concept and not a number.
[15:55] <bildramer> x / inf = 0
[15:55] <bildramer> derp
[15:55] <Shrub> I thought Neutronium was just where it's composed entirely of Neutrons
[15:55] <zeroZshadow> Tukiko, shhh :P i wanted to see what they where gonna try
[15:55] <Shrub> as opposed to electrons and protons
[15:55] <Tukiko> Can't do algebra with infinity. :P That's why we invented limits in Calculus.
[15:55] <Tukiko> Aww, sorry. :c
[15:56] <Perry> To destroy the planet, I have a formula better than E=Mc2
[15:56] <zeroZshadow> i'm learning basic calculus atm
[15:56] <bildramer> x / lim(x->inf) x = lim(x->inf) x/x = inf/inf
[15:56] <Perry> x/0
[15:56] <zeroZshadow> its a pain
[15:56] <bildramer> probably
[15:56] <Tukiko> But you know that someone is going to pull up that retarded math joke that equates 1 and 2 by dividing by zero.
[15:56] <Slothic> Anyone who wanna do me a huge favor? ;D
[15:56] <zeroZshadow> Tukiko, hehe
[15:56] <bildramer> E^3=m^3c^6
[15:56] <bildramer> derp
[15:56] <Slothic> Anyone here who is good at skinning? :P
[15:56] <Tukiko> bildramer, that's wrong because in order to do lim(x->inf) x/x you first must do x/x=1
[15:57] <Bomb_Spammer> matter composed entirely of neutrons wouldn't work AFAIK
[15:57] <Asmageddon> I'm quite good at skinning

[15:57] <Perry> I didn't know that

[15:57] <Tukiko> Yeah, frosted flakes have a short half-life

[15:58] <vurtual> what's the half-lief of a game boy color save battery?
[15:58] <Bomb_Spammer> Damn
[15:58] <Bomb_Spammer> Then what am i thinking of?
[15:58] <Perry> Neutronium = notch
[15:58] <Shrub> Notchonium
[15:58] <vurtual> I remember one time
[15:58] <bildramer> um
[15:58] <Perry> Neutronium is frequently used in science fiction and in popular literature
[15:58] <vurtual> I made a street of the town of Natchitoches
[15:58] <Bomb_Spammer> >However, the meaning of the term has changed over time, and from the last half of the 20th century onward it has been used legitimately to refer to extremely dense phases of matter
[15:58] <bildramer> same particles can't coexist and shit
[15:58] <Bomb_Spammer> Oh there we go
[15:59] <Bomb_Spammer> It used to mean both
[15:59] <Shrub> Yeah
[15:59] <Shrub> that's the one
[15:59] <bildramer> but in nuclear reactions we don't even really use E=mc^2

[16:00] <bildramer> :/
[16:00] <bildramer> fuck you neutrinos
[16:00] <Tukiko> No they'd be fucking you.
[16:00] <bildramer> um
[16:00] <bildramer> no
[16:00] <Tukiko> They penetrate you constantly.
[16:00] <zeroZshadow> BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
[16:00] <Perry> antimatter+matter=energy+nothing?
[16:01] <bildramer> if less than 50% of the energy was neutrinos, then we could just convert mass to energy indefinitely
[16:01] <bildramer> using garbage to power cities the other way

[16:09] <x3point14x> i really need his help
[16:09] <bildramer> what about checking the userlist?
[16:09] <Tukiko> But dimensions zero is a point and dimension 5 is what you get when you travel between two different four dimensional timelines
[16:09] <Perry> When you think of it really hard, HOW can there be only one side?

[16:09] <vurtual> Notch is not here.

[16:10] <x3point14x> anyone of relative authoroty?

[16:10] <bildramer> not really
[16:10] <x3point14x> or that has gifted/been gifted minecraft
[16:10] <Perry> \o/
[16:10] <Coban> im playing 3 days infdev but i never seen monsters why help me :(
[16:10] <vurtual> is it casual?

[16:10] <vurtual> er, peaceful
[16:10] <x3point14x> anyone?
[16:11] <Coban> playing hard
[16:11] <Tukiko> Well, you can travel through time in the 4th dim, but the 5th allows you to travel between two different timelines and then you can do the time travel.
[16:11] <vurtual> try normal
[16:11] <bildramer> most people have premium
[16:11] <Coban> :D
[16:11] <vurtual> step 1: move back on 4th dimension
[16:11] <bildramer> why, x3point14x, what's the problem?
[16:11] <x3point14x> i hsould have premium but it appears to have messed up
[16:11] <vurtual> step 2: preform action in other 3, causing particles to shift
[16:11] <x3point14x> ok so heres the thing
[16:11] <x3point14x> i gave dr_chrisberg monies to gift me the full version rite
[16:11] <vurtual> step 3: Observe as this causes all particles to move differently, logically, resulting in everything ahead of you changing, but not you, as you left.
[16:11] <Perry> If the theory of multiple spacial dimensions is right, the fifth dimension is no different than fourth or third

[16:12] <Tukiko> vurtual that's not how it works

[16:12] <bildramer> I don't know, people usually are told to wait at most a week

[16:31] <Diablodoct0r> oh.
[16:31] <Diablodoct0r> Mine neither
[16:31] <Perry> polan, actually we were talking about more than three spatial dimension and other fun stuff
[16:31] <Diablodoct0r> I think it's size related
[16:31] <Ominus> must be, my level is HUGE heh
[16:31] <Diablodoct0r> Ominus: I meant save it for later cause people will prolly ask again for it :p
[16:31] <Diablodoct0r> And btw
[16:31] <Diablodoct0r> Is it good?
[16:31] <Ominus> oh xD
[16:32] <Diablodoct0r> I mean, whatcha got on it?
[16:32] <Bomb_Spammer> I just saw rule 34 on swine flu
[16:32] <Ominus> meh, not really >.>
[16:32] <Bomb_Spammer> What the fuck
[16:32] <Perry> oh no...
[16:32] <Perry> Bomb_Spammer, what did you expect
[16:32] <Ominus> just a cuple of buildings and mines
[16:32] <Perry> rule 34 is rule 34
[16:32] <Ominus> nothing special really
[16:32] <Perry> nothing is safe
[16:32] <Perry> ther's even rule 34 on rule 34
[16:32] <Ominus> saving the good stuff for mp xD
[16:32] <Diablodoct0r> Ominus: What kind of buildings?
[16:32] <Diablodoct0r> I mean, mine got regenerated so..
[16:33] <Diablodoct0r> I had to rebuild base
[16:33] <Diablodoct0r> I made a chinese wall
[16:33] <Ominus> very uninterresting buildings :(
[16:33] <Diablodoct0r> aww
[16:33] <Diablodoct0r> Well, I rebuilt the great wall of china
[16:33] <Perry> my popsicle tastes like jello
[16:33] <Diablodoct0r> And that was hard
[16:33] <Diablodoct0r> Cause I did that on a mountain
[16:33] <Ominus> out of obsidian!?
[16:33] <Ominus> would be epic and hard work
[16:33] <Diablodoct0r> So it may vary very much in height
[16:33] <bildramer> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truel
[16:33] <bildramer> lol
[16:34] <Diablodoct0r> Ominus: Can creepers explode and destroy obsidian?
[16:35] <visiON_> prolly not
[16:35] <Ominus> hmm, never had one blow up near obsidian, i think imma test it
[16:35] <bildramer> :The game can easily be extended to up to 200 pirates (or further even if you don't increase the amount of gold). Ian Stewart extended it to an arbitrary number of pirates in the May 1999 edition of Scientific American, with further interesting results.:
[16:35] <bildramer> yarr
[16:35] <Diablodoct0r> Ominus
[16:36] <Perry> maths on gun games?
[16:36] <Diablodoct0r> If you find a way to make infinite lava, I want you to tell me
[16:36] <Perry> lolwut
[16:36] <Diablodoct0r> It seems that even lava lakes won't

[16:37] <Diablodoct0r> I WANT ONE OF THOSE
[16:37] <Diablodoct0r> :p
[16:37] <Ominus> yeah i think its intentional that lava is not infinite unlike water
[16:37] <Diablodoct0r> Ominus: I've never managed to get infinite water either
[16:38] <Diablodoct0r> Once I use my bucket on a tile in the sea, the tile starts flowing from other sources and I can't take it
[16:38] <Ominus> :s
[16:38] <Diablodoct0r> But..
[16:38] <Diablodoct0r> Maybe it regenerates that water
[16:38] <Diablodoct0r> If I save and reload
[16:38] <Diablodoct0r> You think?
[16:38] <Ominus> should replace the block with a new infinite block err i eman srping

[17:10] <bildramer> done
[17:10] <visiON> map[128][128]
[17:10] <bildramer> the rest is decoration

[17:10] <visiON> map[128][128]
[17:10] <bildramer> no
[17:10] <bildramer> 2D is slllllllooooooooowwwwwwwww
[17:10] <visiON> HOW U DO X5 Y2
[17:10] <visiON> map[5][2]
[17:10] <Wirtualnosc> Anyway, is someone doing any demake for the contest Notch mentioned?
[17:10] <bildramer> 5+2*128
[17:11] <visiON> oh
[17:11] <visiON> ..
[17:11] <Tukiko> I want to but I'm lazy
[17:11] <visiON> right
[17:11] <bildramer> :P
[17:11] <bildramer> multiplication will be done anyway
[17:11] <Shrub> I think Notch should implement Rare Black Sheep
[17:11] <visiON> ok so
[17:11] <Wirtualnosc> As rare as surface diamond?
[17:11] <Shrub> well
[17:11] <Shrub> 1/50 spawn groups have a black sheep
[17:12] <visiON> 800*600 screen, so.. for 40*30 blocks
[17:12] <visiON> each block is
[17:12] <visiON> 20*20
[17:12] <Shrub> and you get black wool
[17:12] <visiON> damn
[17:12] <visiON> thats small
[17:12] <bildramer> huge
[17:12] <visiON> 20 pixels
[17:12] <visiON> derp
[17:12] <bildramer> huge
[17:12] <visiON> no
[17:12] <bildramer> I would use 8x8 or 6x6
[17:12] <bildramer> lol
[17:12] <visiON> srsly?
[17:12] <Tukiko> Or he can just do dye :P
[17:12] <bildramer> and I would do sideway view
[17:12] <Wirtualnosc> visi, you are talking about demake?
[17:12] <visiON> or
[17:12] <Shrub> yeah
[17:12] <bildramer> for the lulz
[17:12] <visiON> global variables
[17:12] <visiON> yes
[17:12] <visiON> so
[17:13] <Wirtualnosc> What program/language?
[17:13] <visiON> C++
[17:13] <Wirtualnosc> k
[17:13] <bildramer> use SDL
[17:13] <visiON> minecraft2d
[17:13] <visiON> no
[17:13] <visiON> WinAPi
[17:13] <bildramer> yes
[17:13] <bildramer> hahahahahahahahaha
[17:13] <bildramer> hahahahaha
[17:13] <bildramer> hahaha
[17:13] <Wirtualnosc> I was thinking about making minecraft demake too
[17:13] <visiON> yes
[17:13] <bildramer> good luck
[17:13] <Tukiko> Use x86 assembly!
[17:13] <visiON> fucking rectangles
[17:13] <Wirtualnosc> But I thought everyone will do this
[17:13] <visiON> rectangle()
[17:13] <visiON> color(rectangle)
[17:13] <visiON> repeat
[17:13] * Curly-Brace (Curly-Brac@65.69.162.247) has joined #minecraft
[17:13] <Wirtualnosc> So in end I'll probably start doing demake of other game
[17:14] <Tukiko> Do a demake of the original super mario bros. and just have a single color block that can only move right.
[17:14] <Wirtualnosc> It must be indie game.
[17:14] <Tukiko> oh
[17:14] <Tukiko> Holding down the right arrow key isn't much fun anyway
[17:14] <visiON> lol
[17:14] <Wirtualnosc> xD
[17:14] <visiON> make a rectangle
[17:14] <visiON> jump
[17:14] <visiON> and move
[17:14] <visiON> and
[17:14] <visiON> another rectangle, another color as princess
[17:14] <visiON> who is
[17:15] <Wirtualnosc> Still, SMB isn't indie game
[17:15] <visiON> princess x = yourx + 20
[17:15] <visiON> derp
[17:15] <bildramer> for(int i=-1;++i<800;)for(int j=-1;++j<600;)setPixel(i+800*j,map[(i>>3)+128*(j>>3)]);
[17:15] <visiON> btw
[17:15] <visiON> haha
[17:15] <visiON> lmao
[17:15] <visiON> btw
[17:15] <Wirtualnosc> Anyway, rectangles remind me tibia more
[17:15] <bildramer> where setPixel is 2 lines
[17:15] <visiON> what is the character called
[17:15] <visiON> in minecraft
[17:15] <visiON> miner?
[17:15] <visiON> :D
[17:15] <Wirtualnosc> Notch
[17:15] <bildramer> :l
[17:15] <visiON> xD
[17:15] <bildramer> bob
[17:16] <Wirtualnosc> bob the builder
[17:16] <visiON> bob the builder
[17:16] <visiON> hah
[17:16] <Wirtualnosc> ninja'd
[17:16] <bildramer> lol
[17:16] <Slothic> I need someone who are willing to add a skull to my minecraft shirt!.
[17:16] <visiON> yea
[17:16] <Shrub> It's weird how you can just get pretty much infinite flint
[17:16] <bildramer> lol
[17:17] <visiON> class Notch{int x;int y;bool dir;};
[17:17] <Wirtualnosc> awww
[17:17] <Wirtualnosc> Screw this, I'm doing minecraft demake
[17:17] <visiON> no
[17:17] <visiON> :(
[17:17] <Wirtualnosc> Even though everyone does this
[17:17] <visiON> haha yeah
[17:17] <visiON> there will be like 100 minecraft 2d entries
[17:17] <visiON> xD
[17:17] <Wirtualnosc> Yeah XD
[17:17] <visiON> but dudes
[17:17] <bildramer> "et's kick things down a notch"
[17:17] <visiON> SDL is new
[17:17] <visiON> winapi isnt
[17:17] <bildramer> l
[17:17] <visiON> so ima use winapi
[17:17] <bildramer> http://gamejolt.com/blog/indie-game-demake-contest/23/
[17:17] <bildramer> SDL is fast
[17:17] <Wirtualnosc> I'm using TGF2
[17:18] <visiON> did you read about it..?
[17:18] <bildramer> WinAPI is platform-depedend, slow, old
[17:18] <visiON> old
[17:18] <visiON> thats the point
[17:18] <bildramer> "old" as in "deprecated and obsolete"
[17:18] <visiON> drawing 2d is always fast
[17:18] <bildramer> no
[17:18] <visiON> unless you loop shit loads
[17:18] <bildramer> setting every pixel on a screen in windows needs over 200ms
[17:18] <Tukiko> If I end up doing a minecraft demake, I'll probably end up making it as a 2D game with all of the stuff in Minecraft, but I'll either never finish it or end up developing it past Minecraft
[17:18] <Wirtualnosc> Unless you want OMGWHATTHEHELL 2d graphic effects
[17:18] <Tukiko> functionality wise but still 2D and crappy
[17:18] <Wirtualnosc> then winAPI should be fine
[17:19] <visiON> THATS THE POINT
[17:19] <visiON> ITS SUPPSOED TO BE OLD
[17:19] <visiON> derp
[17:19] <Tukiko> lolol
[17:19] <visiON> like
[17:19] <visiON> 90s minecraft
[17:19] <Tukiko> NES is deprecated and obsolete, but I still play it.
[17:19] <Wirtualnosc> ^
[17:19] <visiON> my snes broke :(
[17:19] <Wirtualnosc> :(
[17:19] <Tukiko> So therefore WinAPI is just fine
[17:19] <visiON> still have the games tho
[17:19] <Wirtualnosc> What games do you have?
[17:20] <visiON> umm
[17:20] <visiON> terminator 2, SMB

[17:20] <Wirtualnosc> For snes?
[17:20] <visiON> i think so
[17:20] <visiON> wait
[17:20] <visiON> does NES have yellow disks
[17:20] <visiON> or SNES?
[17:20] <visiON> i might have mixed it up
[17:20] <Wirtualnosc> Umm
[17:21] <bildramer> :|
[17:21] <bildramer> WinAPI needs lots of stuff
[17:21] <Wirtualnosc> SMB was never released alone, without other games, for SNES
[17:21] <bildramer> complicated to draw shit
[17:21] <visiON> oh
[17:21] <bildramer> SDL is much less lines
[17:21] <visiON> ..
[17:21] <visiON> no
[17:21] <bildramer> yes
[17:21] <Wirtualnosc> it was released as Super Mario All Stars

[17:25] <visiON> void move(bool x,bool y)
[17:25] <visiON> is ok?
[17:25] <visiON> right
[17:25] <visiON> havent made a game before derp
[17:26] <Shrub> Graves for a block in Minecraft. Y/N
[17:26] <CyborgDragon> oh shit what're you doin boy!
[17:26] <CyborgDragon> actually yeah, it's fine. xD
[17:27] <visiON> heh
[17:27] <visiON> derp
[17:27] <visiON> all functions void
[17:28] <Wirtualnosc> booleans?
[17:28] <visiON> 0 = left; 1 = right
[17:28] <Wirtualnosc> Ah
[17:28] <visiON> and of course, for y, if true, jump()
[17:28] <visiON> umm
[17:29] <visiON> how to make jump funkion
[17:29] <Wirtualnosc> and if false, fall(), which checks also if its standing on platform?
[17:29] <Wirtualnosc> hm
[17:29] <Wirtualnosc> jumping is the worst thing in platform movement engines :S
[17:29] <visiON> i know
[17:29] <Wirtualnosc> Try something like, do a loop
[17:29] <Shrub> Will a saddled pig despawn?
[17:29] <Wirtualnosc> and it should move, first 6 pixels, then 5 and so on
[17:30] <visiON> until y = currentY+1;y++
[17:30] <visiON> then fall
[17:30] <Wirtualnosc> yes
[17:30] <visiON> ah
[17:30] <visiON> then it goes to negative
[17:30] <visiON> which means its dropping
[17:30] <Wirtualnosc> negative is flying up/jumping

[17:31] <visiON> ..
[17:31] <visiON> no
[17:32] <visiON> you go up
[17:32] <visiON> y increases
[17:32] <Wirtualnosc> hm
[17:32] <visiON> you go right, x increases
[17:32] <visiON> thats how it goes
[17:32] <Wirtualnosc> I know that when you go right, x increases
[17:32] <Wirtualnosc> But I thought that when you go down, y increases
[17:32] <visiON> Nope
[17:32] <Wirtualnosc> I thought it was always like that when programming
[17:33] <Wirtualnosc> But you know better, since I'm not even a rookie in C++ :P

[17:38] <Wirtualnosc> ah, ok

[17:38] <Tukiko> Why would you use a bool? You need 3 values for each axis.. -, 0, +
[17:38] <visiON> ..
[17:39] <visiON> XY
[17:39] <visiON> XYZ
[17:39] <visiON> 2D
[17:39] <visiON> shit i fked up
[17:39] <visiON> >2D
[17:39] <visiON> >XYZ
[17:39] <visiON> wat
[17:39] <Marach> f-zero gx is Fucking Hard (TM)
[17:39] <Tukiko> Yeah, but you can move 3 different ways in the X axis.. You can move back, forward, or not at all.
[17:39] <visiON> press arrow key
[17:39] <visiON> move()
[17:40] <Tukiko> The nyou need MoveX and MoveY
[17:40] <Tukiko> Not just Move
[17:40] <visiON> ...
[17:40] <visiON> no
[17:40] <Tukiko> Well what if you move straight up
[17:40] <Tukiko> Say true is +
[17:40] <visiON> then x = 0
[17:40] <Tukiko> Move(???, true)
[17:40] <visiON> Move(0,1)
[17:40] <Cintiq> http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1277984784239.jpg
[17:40] <Cintiq> ok, that's cool
[17:40] <Tukiko> But what if you move -
[17:40] <visiON> haha yeah
[17:40] <visiON> oh
[17:41] <visiON> shit you're right
[17:41] <Tukiko> Move(0, -1)?
[17:41] <Tukiko> lol :3
[17:41] <Tukiko> Glad I could help :)
[17:41] <visiON> bool moveX
[17:41] <visiON> if true, move x
[17:41] <visiON> since shit room on paper
[17:41] <visiON> you might have noticed i also write on desk
[17:41] <visiON> lol
[17:42] <Tukiko> Well what you could either do is have it use a byte for each movement or use MoveX and MoveY with bools with false = - and true = + (or whatever) and only call those when you are actually moving
[17:42] <visiON> naw
[17:42] <Tukiko> So only call MoveX(true) when you hit the right arrow or something
[17:42] <visiON> this works
[17:42] <visiON> :D
[17:42] <visiON> oh
[17:42] <visiON> damn you good
[17:42] <Ominus101> lol
[17:42] <visiON> How old are you?
[17:42] <Tukiko> MoveX(false) left arrow and don't call MoveX at all if you don't hit an arrow
[17:42] <Tukiko> 20 lol
[17:42] <ChJees> I am drowning in coal!

[17:43] <Tukiko> I was originally an astrophysics major, then went to computer science but got into a really good school that doesn't have comp sci so I went to math with a comp sci minor
[17:43] <Tukiko> And I might not even have enough classes for the minor! D:

[18:10] <Diablo|afk> <3
[18:10] <Diablo|afk> yw
[18:10] <Diablo|afk> I'm thinking of making inpenetrable base defenses
[18:10] <Diablo|afk> Using obsidian :D
[18:10] <Diablo|afk> Since..
[18:10] <ZaxKellens> Not impenetrable
[18:10] <ZaxKellens> tnt = byebye
[18:10] <Diablo|afk> I have almost a thousand blocks so far
[18:10] <Trapiki> Well shit, I'be been on this map for months and not seen one diamond :V
[18:10] <Diablo|afk> TNT won't affect it Zax
[18:10] <ZaxKellens> TNT explodes obsidian
[18:10] <Diablo|afk> Lol Trapiki
[18:10] <ZaxKellens> It has before
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> I doubt it Zax >_>
[18:11] <Trapiki> Trufax
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> Obsidian is incincible to anything but my diamond pickaxe
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> And it takes AGES
[18:11] <Trapiki> NOt one shiny diamond :c
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> to get through
[18:11] <ZaxKellens> Have you tried tnt?
[18:11] <ZaxKellens> It blows it up just like it would stone
[18:11] <ZaxKellens> One deep
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> >_>
[18:11] <Trapiki> I feel like they're always on the other side of the wall, laughing at me :C
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> I don't wanna waste a single block for that purpose
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> NTO A SINGLE ONE YOU HEAR ME
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> Ominus
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> You need to blow up some obsidian for me
[18:11] <Diablo|afk> :[
[18:12] <Diablo|afk> see if it works
[18:12] <ZaxKellens> It does
[18:12] <ZaxKellens> Someone tested it before
[18:12] <Diablo|afk> Yes but dude
[18:12] <Diablo|afk> Obsidian is updated
[18:12] <Diablo|afk> Much stronger now
[18:12] <Ominus> i shall try

[18:15] <SireTRM> Diablo|afk, there is NOC obsidian. Go to the lava level and it is created between lava pools and water springs flowing.
[18:15] <Shrub> It wouldn't even
[18:15] <copyboy> Notch's face is cute but not funny
[18:15] <visiON> fine
[18:15] <Shrub> Notch looks so trustable
[18:16] <vurtual> notch's face should occour as a particle sometimes
[18:16] <vurtual> for magma
[18:16] <vurtual> instead of a fireball, notch face!
[18:16] <Shrub> Hahahaha
[18:16] <visiON> not funny
[18:16] <Shrub> THAT would be awesome
[18:16] <ZaxKellens> vurtual : Mornin
[18:16] <Iguana> Notch's face should be on a creeper
[18:16] <DimJim> and instead of the hiss it should be a sound clip of him
[18:16] <vurtual> I wonder if that's in the jar
[18:16] <Shrub> DimJim
[18:16] <Shrub> the sound clip
[18:16] <Vis{Sleep}> Notch is on
[18:16] <visiON> what

[18:17] <ZaxKellens> Then I'd laugh MC Emcee
[18:17] <Shrub> then Notch won't be on
[18:17] <Vis{Sleep}> Quite a few people would be autokicked
[18:17] <DimJim> there will be very few people on
[18:17] <Ominus> is notch on drugs? doubt it, although his work is mind blowing
[18:17] <DimJim> the answer is in the question

[20:12] <Drakkar> no they just wanted people to use pokemon other than the starters through the game
[20:12] <Diablodoct0r> And if he farts..
[20:12] <Diablodoct0r> It would combust

[20:44] <Crix> for me

[20:44] <Crix> depending on how insane i make the ratio
[20:44] <CyborgDragon> if you ever noticed, the normal resolution has stretching at the sides
[20:44] <vurtual> now removed incredibly volataile red cart
[20:44] <vurtual> peripheral vision, CyborgDragon?
[20:45] <CyborgDragon> as you increase the width, the stretching goes down
[20:45] <Crix> stretching goes up
[20:45] <vurtual> gonna do GYM LEADER CASTLE
[20:45] <Crix> as you increase width
[20:45] <CyborgDragon> except the sun and moon dont stretch in my peripheral vision
[20:45] <CyborgDragon> and on crix, it goes down
[20:45] <CyborgDragon> no*

[20:46] <vurtual> OK GUYS YOUR POKEKNOWLEDGE IS THE ONLY THING TO HELP ME THROUGH
[20:46] <CyborgDragon> as you stretch, it desquashes

[20:46] <Crix> yes
[20:46] <Crix> thats what i'm saying

[20:46] <vurtual> because I lost my other one
[20:46] <CyborgDragon> that's what i've been saying crix
[20:47] <Crix> problem is this

[20:52] <vurtual> let's just use vaporeon
[20:52] <Crix> My original point was that while it looks funny, having a wider game can be beneficial because of more peripheral vision
[20:53] <CyborgDragon> you dont really get more peripheral vision, you actually see just as much
[20:53] <CyborgDragon> its just squashed in mc's normal resolution
[20:53] <Crix> you see more to the sides... I mean if you run the game.exe... and change the size of the window
[20:53] <Crix> you WILL see more
[20:53] <Crix> i'm 100% sure of it
[20:53] <Crix> because i'm doing it right now
[20:53] <CyborgDragon> you dont actually see MORE blocks
[20:53] <Crix> trees APPEAR on the sides of the screen
[20:54] <Crix> you do
[20:54] <CyborgDragon> as am i
[20:54] <CyborgDragon> and im not seeing more blocks
[20:54] <CyborgDragon> im just seeing the peripherals desquash

[20:56] <vurtual> suggestions!?
[20:56] <CyborgDragon> i hooked it up to my hdtv, it does NOT show more, it just desquashes, then stretches
[20:56] <Crix> what does the hdtv have to do with anything?
[20:56] <CyborgDragon> high resolution
[20:56] <vurtual> "What's the matter, trainer!?"
[20:56] <CyborgDragon> so i could stretch it more
[20:56] <Crix> well either way
[20:56] <Crix> its about ratios
[20:56] <Crix> not number of pixels
[20:56] <vurtual> vaporeon or charizard!?
[20:56] <Crix> just lemme get some pics
[20:56] <Crix> so i can show you :D
[20:56] <CyborgDragon> its about a funny little fucking thing called perspective angle

[20:58] <Crix> its okay, we're just having bad commincations :/
[20:59] <Crix> but ima link you these pics
[20:59] <Crix> so you can see what i mean
[20:59] <Crix> i'm bad at explaining it i guess
[20:59] <CyborgDragon> but still, it's not showing more when i stretch decrease, it's just desquashing and stretching after a certain point
[20:59] <CyborgDragon> stretch/decrease
[20:59] <vurtual> Fire spin is a cruel, cruel move to use on a dewgong.
[20:59] <vurtual> No escape, just damage slowly.
[20:59] <vurtual> until they finally collapse.
[21:00] <visiON> Anyone wanna help me with minecraft 2d? :(
[21:00] <vurtual> OH, A LIGHT TAP DECIDED THE OUTCOME!

[21:01] * wolf_alex (chatzilla@67.70.87.19) has joined #minecraft
[21:01] <vurtual> fire spin is a move I should teach to pokemon more. Be less about heavy damage.

[21:02] <vurtual> Oh, it still can't move!
[21:02] <vurtual> burn little dragonair :D
[21:02] <Crix> As you can see, theres MORE in the wider picture

[21:03] <Crix> ><
[21:03] <CyborgDragon> yeah crix, i see
[21:03] <vurtual> What's that, cueball? Want me to stop? Sick of my charizard annihilating you?
[21:03] <CyborgDragon> but for me it's not doing that
[21:03] <Crix> that's the weird part ><
[21:03] * Cue jumps
[21:03] <CyborgDragon> for me it is just desquashing the peripheral vision that is squished
[21:03] <vurtual> Don't want me slowly, slowly chewing up the last of your HP?
[21:03] <vurtual> you told dratini to use hyper beam on a flying pokemon, this is your danger.
[21:04] <CyborgDragon> and after a certain point acting like elastic paper, squishing in the center and stretching vertically at the sides
[21:04] <vurtual> AAA THEY GOT THROUGH
[21:04] <vurtual> charizard fainted
[21:04] * Cue mauls vurtual
[21:04] <Crix> hmm...

[21:04] <vurtual> QUICK ATTACK!
[21:04] <Crix> i any case
[21:04] <vurtual> You all find this awesome.
[21:04] <vurtual> "Being unable to move hurts."
[21:04] <Crix> in* you should see what happens when I make it a ratio of like 10:1

[21:16] <vurtual> have to pick two more :|
[21:16] <Unsub> Eevee evolutions blow.
[21:16] <KinoftheFlames> parthon: I was thinking of unique ideas like gravity on 6 faces of a world, no gravity. Objects moving through space, and building space stations.
[21:16] <Unsub> Also yeah, odd.
[21:17] <vurtual> Unsub, in stadium, they ahve the benefit
[21:17] <vurtual> of having a huge variety of moves, apparently
[21:17] <Unsub> The benefit
[21:17] <KinoftheFlames> parthon: like if you were building a space station and you took away a block to the outside, you'd get sucked out in to space. sucks to be you!
[21:17] <Unsub> of blowing.
[21:17] <vurtual> vaporeon has aurora beam and surf, and jolteon has all sorts of moves
[21:17] <vurtual> Double kick, Pin Missile, Thunder, and Toxic.
[21:17] <Demki> hm... the date 10/10/2010, written shortly it is 10/10/10 , removing the '/' it is 101010, converting to decimal from binary and it give you 42... this answers some questions.

[21:18] <Parthon> a bit more like dwarf fortress in space
[21:18] <Unsub> So that's goof for like what psychic, flying, water, and normal?

[21:32] <Vis{Idk}> anyways, we all spilled out
[21:32] <CyborgDragon> no, you aren't addicted until you have a minecraft falling dream, and you wake up as you impact the water
[21:32] <visiON> no
[21:32] <CyborgDragon> and when you wake up, you find that your bed is wet.
[21:32] <Vis{Idk}> I was adventuring for several days
[21:32] <visiON> water wont kill
[21:32] <visiON> haha
[21:32] <Vis{Idk}> Then I found one of the 'secret tunnles'
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> I walked slowly inside and it got bright
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> there was the HUGE circular chamber- only one thing
[21:33] * Wedge (wedge@cpe-24-161-122-150.hvc.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> there were people inside!
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> It was a stage!
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> wtf
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> So, I talked to them
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> for some reason it was like Harvest Moon DS style chatting..
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> Anyways, there was three of them in there
[21:33] <Vis{Idk}> and they banished me because I couldn't act :|
[21:33] <vurtual> I had a dream where I was in a nethack dnugeon
[21:34] <vurtual> and we were like, some kind of D&D group
[21:34] <Ominus> :(
[21:34] <Vis{Idk}> Then I walked outside and into the n earest cave because it was raining
[21:34] <vurtual> my brother and my friend
[21:34] <vurtual> we were all set up, then I find starwars models, and then we find us in our house(my friend having been vanished)
[21:34] <Ominus> i am happy that i still dream about flying
[21:34] <vurtual> so I'm worried that it's a house-sized mimic, waiting to strike.
[21:34] <Vis{Idk}> and a motherfucking spider landed on my chest and knocked me over
[21:34] <Vis{Idk}> pinning me down
[21:34] <Vis{Idk}> his face in mine
[21:34] <Vis{Idk}> then he got shot by a motherfucking arrow
[21:34] <Vis{Idk}> there was this hot blocky chick saving me!

[21:35] <Vis{Idk}> Then I woke up :|
[21:35] <Ominus> xD
[21:35] <vurtual> you are going to rape yourself, and also have 8 legs, but then get saved by a girlfriend
[21:35] <vurtual> or in short, porn will nearly ruin your life
[21:35] <vurtual> then you get a girlfriend
[21:35] <vurtual> the spider legs partially may allude to your own boner as an extra limb.
[21:35] <Ominus> O.O
[21:35] <Ominus> lol
[21:35] <Vis{Idk}> being a minecrafter is hard
[21:35] <Vis{Idk}> do you know how much baby powder I put between my legs?
[21:36] <Vis{Idk}> You can't bend your legs outward!
[21:36] <Vis{Idk}> it was chaffing sooooo bad
[21:36] <Ominus> its hard being a miner these days );
[21:36] <Ominus> in minecraft that is hehe
[21:36] <CyborgDragon> it's hard until you find yourself 53 well earned diamonds
[21:37] <Vis{Idk}> 53 != 64
[21:37] <CyborgDragon> then you make yourself some diamond armor, which stops the chafing, and some a set of tools, which last damn near a long time.
[21:37] <Vis{Idk}> so you FAIL

[22:02] <Diablodoct0r> spam protections are easy
[22:02] <Diablodoct0r> I just put in one at @seen
[22:02] <Crix> @seendiablodoct0r
[22:02] <Animator> Kick bot and people responsible. Either that or use whatever protection you have planned.
[22:02] <C418> oh sure. I have spam protection
[22:02] <bildramer> fail
[22:02] <Crix> @seen diablodoct0r

[22:02] <Diablodoct0r> If I'm in here,
[22:02] <Diablodoct0r> He doesn't take you seriously
[22:03] <Dezerus> Anything new?
[22:03] <Animator> Kicking bot prevents people fron keeping on using the commands.
[22:03] <KinoftheFlames> I hope the secret update is some form of minecart automation. Considering how Notch just removed booster tracks :(

[22:12] <bildramer> full cloth armor, stone sword, full hp
[22:12] <Rizyq> Recently a spider killed me on easy.
[22:12] <Rizyq> With what you had.
[22:12] <bildramer> because I kept right-clicking instead of left-clicking
[22:13] <bildramer> >_<
[22:13] <Crix> lol
[22:13] <Rizyq> haha, I was trying to kill it with my fists, actually
[22:13] <bildramer> then I got a bow
[22:13] <Rizyq> I came back, punched it once, and it died.
[22:13] <vurtual> recently, I killed a few hard mode spiders with my fists, at once.
[22:13] <bildramer> bashing stuff with a bow is surprisingly effective

[22:13] <Diablodoct0r> But I prefer sword
[22:13] <Diablodoct0r> I'm not an idiot
[22:13] <Diablodoct0r> >_>

[22:14] <Rizyq> I prefer stone hammers.

[22:14] <bildramer> good job, copeh
[22:14] <FNugget> bukkit of lava is too powerful, should make diamond buckets the only one capable of carrying lava
[22:14] <Rizyq> Rock swords don't make any sense...
[22:14] <Rizyq> Yeah, but you can't get drops as easy.

[22:14] <Dezerus> Not true...

[22:15] <Dezerus> You ever studied the middle ages?
[22:15] <Rizyq> twice, and no Dezerus, not really.
[22:15] <Diablodoct0r> Rizyq: Stone age was named it for a reason :p
[22:15] <Rizyq> Haha, true.
[22:15] <Rizyq> I just think a hammer would be more effective.
[22:15] <Dezerus> They used stone swords.
[22:16] <Crix> they also used stone condoms...

[22:42] <visiON> w
[22:42] <Rizyq> Diablodoct0r, they're more usefull than meat cause they stack.
[22:42] <bildramer> nice idea, importing creative
[22:42] <ez> let me show you optimal farming :P
[22:43] <Rizyq> At least, I think they do
[22:43] <Diablodoct0r> bread doesn't stack
[22:43] <FNugget> my current farm set up. Theres water running under the grass raised area. walking down the middle patch picks up all the items.
[22:43] <Crix> yea
[22:43] <Rizyq> Don't they, xD?
[22:43] <ez> http://elinz.jalbum.net/Minecraft-2/slides/20100218_paradisefarm_ez.jpg
[22:43] <Diablodoct0r> No
[22:43] <Crix> 64 wheat + 4 wood = 21 breads
[22:43] <Crix> that you can carry in 2 spaces
[22:43] <Diablodoct0r> They're bugged
[22:43] <Crix> much better than any other kinds of foods
[22:43] <Diablodoct0r> Once you right-click to place one down, it's unstackable
[22:43] <Crix> wat is
[22:43] <ez> picking things up a bit trickier tho
[22:43] <Diablodoct0r> Grilled bacon is better
[22:43] * Mattress (Mattress@97-126-105-46.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #minecraft

[22:43] <Crix> but WHEAT can stack

[22:43] <Diablodoct0r> Crix: I don't eat wheat
[22:43] <bildramer> so we get no bitching
[22:44] <Crix> but you can make wheat into bread easily
[22:44] <FNugget> which is why i conside my farm pretty good
[22:44] <ez> but it works well
[22:44] <FNugget> you can walk along the top edges to quickly sow and reap
[22:44] <ez> and grows fast

[23:03] <Snowman> No, but I have to retrieve ice samples from the sides of cliffs
[23:03] <ez> I think the walls I climbed were 14 metres high

[23:43] <Rizyq> haha :P
[23:43] <Kokopure> it has a mouse you can use with the tablet.
[23:43] <Kokopure> however, if I take the mouse OFF the tablet
[23:43] <Rizyq> Cool
[23:43] <Zaneo> the take on me literal was one of my favourites
[23:43] <Kokopure> while having pressed down the clicky
[23:44] <bildramer> ...
[23:44] <Kokopure> it will think the clicky is still pressed down.
[23:44] <ez> this is nice http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fFU347a1mA
[23:44] <Kokopure> hence, I can click once, take the mouse off
[23:44] <Kokopure> and it will continually click until I put the mouse back on
[23:44] <ez> closest one to the first really heh
