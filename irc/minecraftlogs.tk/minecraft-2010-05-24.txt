[0:51] <CrazySpai> 4GB is modern for me
[0:51] <vurtual> The mysterious "Memory" value is "5.7 GiB"
[0:51] <CrazySpai> But 2GB is common in desktop PC's
[0:51] <Yourself> i've got 8 in this machine
[0:51] <Yourself> 6 in the ubuntu one

[1:06] <Marafk> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autechre
[1:06] <Marafk> the page has all sounds and images removed
[1:06] <Marafk> is this global?
[1:06] <bildramer> lol
[1:06] <bildramer> looks fine for me
[1:06] <Animator> The MCSharp problem is over, officially. All loose ends are tied.
[1:06] <Marafk> no wait
[1:06] <bildramer> what was the problem?
[1:06] <bildramer> how was it fixed?
[1:06] <Marafk> 2 sound clips are missing
[1:07] <Bmthrules> I noticed the chat log.
[1:07] <blaster> http://i47.tinypic.com/ftdeo5.png work on the minecraft present for notch is going well
[1:07] <Bmthrules> Looks good.
[1:07] <blaster> It will look better once we get the second story on

[1:08] * Raptor_on_hoverboard is now known as Cial
[1:08] <vurtual> you mean "the last airbender"
[1:08] <vurtual> Also why is everyone white
[1:08] <vurtual> what is this craziness
[1:08] <Bmthrules> Theres like 900 black, hispanic, asians in that movie.

[1:10] * Cat is now known as PyroPyro
[1:10] <Bmthrules> Roflmao -.-
[1:11] <shairn> wat
[1:12] <Yourself> that's interesting
[1:12] <Yourself> you can raise lava to any level in infdev by placing sand above it
[1:12] <Yourself> but that's not what's interesting
[1:13] <Yourself> what's interesting is that you don't have to place the sand or gravel right above it
[1:13] <Yourself> you can put it anywhere on the same column and if the block would fall into lava it will instead turn into lava before falling
[1:13] <Kodaichi> no tomato paste, had to make due with mostly cheese
[1:13] <Yourself> and the lava will float there
[1:13] <Kodaichi> it suffices :P
[1:13] <Yourself> so you can make floating lava blobs in infdev
[1:13] <vurtual> http://www.livestream.com/zarrotsukei guy is playing minecraft!

[1:21] <Cial> im tired of seeing a rebel flag every time i go to town
[1:22] <EmpiresBane> there may be hicks, but that doesn't make it the south
[1:22] <Cial> EmpiresBane, it is in the south according to all the history books ive ever seen
[1:22] <Yourself> tennesee counts as the south
[1:22] * Tamschi1 (Tamme@p5DC10740.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #minecraft
[1:23] <EmpiresBane> ok. it's south according to the civil war, but geologicaly
[1:23] <Yourself> if kentucky and virginia are south, tennesee is definitely south

[1:25] <Cial> its west of Mississippi thats why its considered in the west
[1:26] <EmpiresBane> it's almost part of mexico now, though
[1:26] <EmpiresBane> i think they may be trying to annex it
[1:26] <CrazySpai> It was also once colonized by the Spanish and in the American mindset, anything the Spanish/Mexicans had occupied was the "west"

[1:29] <EmpiresBane> no. it just rains all the time
[1:29] <vurtual> I had no military forces, and whenever you did the required drive-them-away actions, they would just stop everything and run out to kill everyone
[1:29] <Cial> oh
[1:29] <EmpiresBane> we want sunparks
[1:29] <vurtual> They would seemingly force your men to stop any kind of inescapable forced sequence dooming them, and then they'd just walk around freely
[1:30] <bildramer> uh?
[1:31] <Yourself> i like the natural land arches that form in infdev

[1:33] <Cial> ctrl+printscreen?
[1:33] <Yourself> it'd be trivial to add one that just outputs what's on the screen
[1:33] <Yourself> Cial, i don't want to have to open up a paint program just to crop the thing
[1:33] <CrazySpai> Yourself: You lazy fuck
[1:33] <EmpiresBane> it would be kinda nice
[1:33] <Yourself> CrazySpai, when you're doing it for one screenshot, that's lazy

[1:41] <Cial> i want boats

[1:48] <Yourself> i've been meaning to time it
[1:48] <Yourself> my world is 18 MB now
[1:48] <blaster> in cartograph?
[1:48] <Yourself> yes, i have a python script that runs cartograph, rotates the image it creates so that north is up and then uploads it to my website
[1:49] <Yourself> i should add timers in it
[1:49] <blaster> yourself can you give me the link once its done
[1:49] <Yourself> i always post the link when it's done
[1:49] <blaster> Also, my map has 2 actual rivers

[1:52] <Yourself> it's uploading now
[1:52] <Yourself> so it took a little over 4 minutes

[1:54] <Yourself> http://www.ultimatepronoun.com/images/minecraft/map4_corrected.png
[1:54] <blaster> Guys, I had an idea for minecraft that could be easy to program
[1:54] <blaster> Custom tile to tile interactions
[1:54] <blaster> change tile type, move tile and remove tile
[1:55] <bildramer> oi
[1:55] <blaster> Um... nice backwards 4
[1:55] <bildramer> ?
[1:55] <bildramer> what.
[1:55] <blaster> You have not built much
[1:55] <Yourself> that's because most of what i've built is underground
[1:55] <bildramer> I should make a fort as big as this pic
[1:56] <blaster> Yesh
[1:56] <bildramer> like 256x512 blocks
[1:56] <bildramer> then give people the map or something

[2:00] <bildramer> needs moar Notch in here
[2:00] <bildramer> to cheer him up and make him work etc.
[2:01] <Yourself> in terms of scale, i don't know if i'd classify those as separate towns

[2:01] <blaster> first floor half done
[2:01] <bildramer> you really need to work faster

[2:01] <bildramer> half a floor in 2 days
[2:01] <blaster> Anyway server offline now

[2:20] <darkedone02> it seems that spears and halbards are being missed in most mmo and rpg games out there.
[2:20] <Rooster> Because spears are way too awesome

[2:20] * [console] is now known as PyroPyro
[2:21] <darkedone02> The Elder Scrolls didn't have them, Dragon Age didn't have them, most of the mmo games out there except the korean and chinese-related games have spears, but most of the western games out there miss out on the spears.

[2:22] <darkedone02> Dragon Age and Elder Scrolls are a great series, and it seems most rpg and book stories more concentrated on the Sword and Shield and the Axe then the spear.

[2:22] <CrazySpai> Animator: Have time to talk?
[2:23] <Quatroking> Animator did you punish mrwormy yet
[2:23] <darkedone02> Spears been around since the stone age, why not improve the spears and add them to rpg games more often...

[2:23] <Rooster> Animator cancer has been cured what
[2:23] <bildramer> hooray
[2:23] <bildramer> how?
[2:23] <vurtual> because spear=mook wepon
[2:24] <bildramer> and how much money does it cost?
[2:24] <vurtual> sword=very hard ot use best wepon
[2:24] <Rooster> I smell bulshit
[2:24] <bildramer> is it patented?
[2:24] <bildramer> yet?
[2:24] <Miclee> Spears are only useful in games with mounted combat.
[2:24] <bildramer> :P
[2:24] <Rooster> Links
[2:24] <Rooster> I demand them
[2:24] <vurtual> no that's pikes Miclee
[2:24] <bildramer> spears are very useful in most pre-modern age RTSs
[2:24] <exe> diablo 2
[2:24] <darkedone02> spears been used alot in medieval combat as well, they often been used to counter against cavalry.
[2:24] <bildramer> they rape cavalry usually

[2:26] <darkedone02> still, spears need to added in the future of rpg games, even the best developers out there seem to leave them out... except for diablo 2, which actually carries spears and javalins, why not add them in diablo 3, and the next dragon age game if bioware going to add one?
[2:26] <blaster> Spears in minecraft
[2:26] <blaster> You can stab enemies with em, and there is a chance they will get stuck on the end allowing you to control their movements temporarily
[2:26] <darkedone02> even the next elder scrolls should add it... along with old weapons they forgotten in Daggerfall like the Dai-katana, and wakasashi
[2:27] <blaster> Oblivion had Dai-katana
[2:27] <Konogan> Oblivion have Dai-katanas.
[2:27] <Konogan> Duh.
[2:27] <Rooster> I'd hope in addition to spears, you could create a rock/paper/scissors Minecraft
[2:27] <Rooster> Arrows->Swords->Spears
[2:27] <Rooster> Or something
[2:27] <Miclee> Spear > Arrow?
[2:27] <Miclee> How?
[2:28] <vurtual> no
[2:28] <darkedone02> there's already an DS game for that Rooster, forgot what it called but it something similar to Battalion
[2:28] <vurtual> just, weapon
[2:28] <blaster> No idea
[2:28] <vurtual> now why can't I ever find the second temple key
[2:28] <darkedone02> Axe -> spear -> sword
[2:28] <blaster> there should not be a rock paper sizzor thing with weapons
[2:28] <blaster> It does not work
[2:28] <Rooster> I meant Bow and Arrow, since there is only 2 weapons in minecraft right now Miclee
[2:28] <vurtual> no rockpapercissors okay
[2:28] <Rooster> What do you suggest then?
[2:28] <Rooster> RPG status
[2:28] <Rooster> Bleg
[2:28] <TrueWolves> Fire Emblem does that
[2:28] <blaster> <Speed Bow - Crossbow - Blunderbus Damage>
[2:29] <vurtual> oh hint system, you so silly
[2:29] <TrueWolves> the Axe > Spear > Sword > Axe thing
[2:29] <vurtual> I'M IN THE ROOM THAT THE KEY IS IN DURP
[2:29] <TrueWolves> and bows are just seperate from it.
[2:29] <blaster> <Speed Dagger - Sword - Axe Damage>
[2:29] <blaster> That system works
[2:29] <Rooster> Bows have to have a weakness
[2:29] <darkedone02> yeah, bow and arrow and sword are the only melee weapons out there, notch should add in the spear and it easy to make, two sticks of wood and 1 stone... but you got to do it on reverse so it won't replace the shovel
[2:29] <blaster> They do low damage compared to crossbows
[2:30] <TrueWolves> make it a triangle
[2:30] <TrueWolves> Range - Spear // Sword - Speed // Axe - Damage
[2:30] <vurtual> It was in the center of the room.
[2:30] <darkedone02> hell, in the future, mobs should carry weapons as well
[2:30] <vurtual> The very center, middle, plain as day, two second puzzle, center of this room.
[2:30] <vurtual> HOW DIDN'T I SEE IT
[2:30] <TrueWolves> a large sword would be somewhere in the middle
[2:30] <TrueWolves> A dagger would be best for speed
[2:30] <Rooster> Maybe a battle ax could be made like a normal ax, except resource on both sides
[2:30] <TrueWolves> Halberg would be range/damage with low speed
[2:31] <blaster> I dont think ranged differences are good.
[2:31] <Rooster> What do you mean?
[2:31] <TrueWolves> They are realistic and a tactical advantage.
[2:31] <Kodaichi> I think differences in power and speed are better
[2:31] <vurtual> QUADRAXIS FIGHT TIME YEAR
[2:31] <vurtual> Anyways minecraft should have glaives.
[2:31] <Kodaichi> and Knockback!
[2:31] <TrueWolves> This is a Triangle idea, with swords in the center
[2:31] <vurtual> sword+stick+stick
[2:31] <blaster> Sword does the most raw damage, Spears can impale people (which imobilises them on the end of your weapon), Warhammers can break bones causing the enemy to drop their weapon
[2:31] <vurtual> slow, longrange.
[2:31] <Rooster> War battle axes
[2:31] <TrueWolves> that's too complex blaster, 3=
[2:32] <blaster> It adds variety
[2:32] <Kodaichi> hammers, stick + log
[2:32] <blaster> how is it too complex?
[2:32] <Kodaichi> or stick + ingot
[2:32] <blaster> Depth =/= complexity
[2:32] <vurtual> Normal attack swings it, making an arc, while mouse2 does a slow, precise jab.

[2:49] <blaster> Mmmhhh....
[2:49] <Yourself> yeah, big words, but it's really quite well understood
[2:49] <blaster> How about an experiment then
[2:49] <vurtual> that boss was awesome

[2:51] <blaster> XD
[2:51] <Yourself> no, it isn't
[2:51] <Yourself> dust in the atmosphere has a cooling effect
[2:52] <Yourself> because it doesn't transmit visible light
[2:52] <Yourself> so the majority of incident solar radiation is reflected into space
[2:52] <blaster> dust is not a gas
[2:52] <TrueWolves> blaster, can you PLEASE go do the research rather then all this?
[2:52] <blaster> dust is tiny pieces of solids

[2:52] <TrueWolves> That doesn't stop it from having a cooling effect, now does it?
[2:52] <Yourself> this is why volcanic eruptions and meteorite collisions cause global cooling
[2:53] <blaster> Then the gas version of dirt is a greenhouse gas, its not dirt
[2:53] <exe> global warming may be real (see wikipedia) but problem is with ecosocialists that want to use it to bring equality and poorness to world
[2:53] <TrueWolves> -.-
[2:53] <Yourself> wtf do you think is in "vaporized dirt"?
[2:53] <blaster> Wikipedia is extremely biased on the matter
[2:53] <Yourself> so is reality
[2:53] <blaster> carbon, silicon ect... depends on the area your are in
[2:54] <TrueWolves> This is a test of my patience of not banning noobs
[2:54] <TrueWolves> That is what this is.
[2:54] <Yourself> it's hard, isn't it?
[2:54] <TrueWolves> I have experince in it, but only in smaller rooms where everyone else wants them banned anyway.
[2:54] <TrueWolves> In a larger room that doesn't happen.
[2:55] <AndrewPH> TrueWolves, gj on op
[2:55] <Yourself> it doesn't matter whether or not "vaporized dirt" is a greenhouse gas or not, we're not dumping 28 billion metric tons of it into the atmosphere every year
[2:55] <exe> like burning food for fuel that gives starvation to poor countries
[2:55] <TrueWolves> It's only half-offical until Siiseli chooses wether to make it offical or not.
[2:56] <LuciferZ> What?
[2:56] <rcfighter> Vaporised dirt?

[2:57] <rcfighter> Because vapor can only be made from fluid

[2:57] <rcfighter> Dirt is not a fluid

[2:57] <TrueWolves> becuase ur doing it wrong.

[2:58] <blaster> People have said its dust, but dust is tiny pieces of solid
[2:58] <TrueWolves> Which it is in the atmosphere? no?
[2:59] <nintendow1> dust is in the atmosphere...
[2:59] <nintendow1> clouds
[2:59] <rcfighter> Thats vapor
[2:59] <TrueWolves> clouds are a vapor
[2:59] <Siiseli> we'll see how it goes

[2:59] <TrueWolves> Hia Sii, this is day 2, =D
[2:59] <rcfighter> So is fog.
[2:59] <Siiseli> kk :D
[2:59] <blaster> water droplets form around the dust
[2:59] <Yourself> yes, there's probably aerosols in clouds
[2:59] <nintendow1> yes
[2:59] <rcfighter> Because fog is caused by low-flying clouds.
[2:59] <Yourself> but it's a small percentage
[3:00] <blaster> Wait... does that mean volcanic eruptions will increase the ammount of clouds in the atmosphere?
[3:00] <blaster> Thats... odd...
[3:00] <TrueWolves> Yes.
[3:00] <Yourself> yes
[3:00] <nintendow1> not that odd

[3:03] <Yourself> no one's actually sure if water clouds increase or decrease temperature

[3:03] <vurtual> so wait
[3:03] <vurtual> WHY IS IT SO HOT IF IT'S SUPPOSED TO COOL THE EARTH
[3:03] <Yourself> but water vapor is a greenhouse gas
[3:03] <TrueWolves> Truth
[3:04] <vurtual> WHY DID I HAVE TO DEAL WITH MY HOUSE BEING 150 DEGREES, AND THE FACT THAT IT'S VARIA SUIT WORTHY HOT OUTSIDE?
[3:04] <blaster> One thing which should never happen: Geneticly engineered bacteria which absorb CO2
[3:04] <TrueWolves> ...
[3:05] <Yourself> blaster, organisms like that already exist
[3:05] <TrueWolves> But there is already... natural... bacteria... that does that...
[3:05] <nintendow1> clouds would decrease the temperature- clouds are white, reflecting light and heat
[3:05] <blaster> Yes, but a geneticly engineered one
[3:05] <blaster> designed to reduce global tempretures
[3:05] <Yourself> nintendow1, but at the same time they can trap heat because they also reflect infrared
[3:05] <Yourself> there are results which go both ways
[3:06] <blaster> Wait a second, potential theory for ice age emerging
[3:06] <TrueWolves> ( ??? ??????)
[3:06] <blaster> A CO2 absorbing bacteria overpopulate the planet
[3:06] <TrueWolves> ???( ?????????)???
[3:06] <blaster> Then the ice comes and kills em all
[3:06] <TrueWolves> ??(??????????)

[3:07] <Yourself> one thing people don't seem to understand about genetically engineered organisms is that if we engineered them, we'd specialize them to a very specific task
[3:07] <Yourself> which would ultimately reduce their biological fitness compared to wild types
[3:07] <Yourself> since wild types have been selected for survivability
[3:07] <blaster> Except in the specialized situation
[3:08] <TrueWolves> Which usualy doesn't acure often in nature
[3:08] <TrueWolves> So them over populating the planet is less likely then any natural one doing so.

[3:09] <vurtual> What if someone ENGINEERS ONE TO MASS-POPULATE?
[3:09] <Yourself> all of this is ignoring the fact that we've been genetically engineering other organisms for thousands of years
[3:10] <Yourself> our methods have just become more sophisticated
[3:10] <vurtual> by haaand?
[3:10] <TrueWolves> sometimes vurtual.
[3:10] <vurtual> can't wait until we can build kitties.

[8:58] <Azathoth> anyone have any good ideas for managing items in a roguelike?
[8:58] <Azathoth> it needs to be very flexible to allow for all kinds of randomly generated items. and i'm not sure what the best way to go about it is
[8:59] <AndrewPH> save them all in a file as they are generated
[9:00] <AndrewPH> or something
[9:00] <AndrewPH> and then assign them an id
[9:01] <Azathoth> well i'm not entirely sure how the item object should even look
[9:01] <Yourself> you could just store a seed for each item that generates it
[9:02] <Azathoth> i'll need a way to specify whether or not items can be equipped/used/whatever and then what effects they have
[9:02] <Yourself> rip off diablo 2's item system
[9:03] <Azathoth> i'm not sure if i should just create a single universal item object that has like a bajillion fields or if i should make a bunch of different item classes that extend it

[10:01] <PuyoDead> 3 fucking pages worth of kids with minimal knowledge in mathemetics talking about how they are sure of an answer.

[10:08] <vurtual> no discussion, just state your opinion and find something else to do really fast.

[10:11] <Azathoth> ...
[10:11] <vurtual> 9/9 cannot be 1, as you didn't account for math tax
[10:11] <vurtual> also what show was it that the intro basically had the name of a character said three times, and I think in black and white
[10:11] <vede> It's actually about 1.082.
[10:11] <Wervyn> In other words, "fuck math, I'm retarded." That's fine too.
[10:11] <vurtual> u trollin'
[10:12] <Wervyn> Just as long as you own that 'tardedness.
[10:12] <vede> But 4srs.
[10:12] <vurtual> no honestly you seem like you're only saying this just to annoy everyone who doesn't care enough about it, and is irked at the concept of a number that's very not one being one
[10:12] <vede> I don't see how 9/9 can be 1. There's no ones in the original, only nines.
[10:12] <Adurah> It's called trolling.
[10:12] <vede> The only two options are 9 and 99.
[10:12] <vurtual> yes it is
[10:12] <vurtual> WHAT IF IT'S
[10:12] <vurtual> Guy wearing two monocles with a bent nose
[10:12] <vurtual> / is his nose
[10:12] <vurtual> and 9 is a monocle

[10:44] <vurtual> I had initially invented this sport called bullet golf
[10:44] <vurtual> I took a pistol, and a waterbottle, in garry's mod. Used a trail to play golf.

[10:49] <vede> Pshaw.

[10:49] <AndrewPH> because my pistol couldn't kill thme
[10:49] <AndrewPH> them*
[10:49] <AndrewPH> When they're doing a fuckton more damage than you and way faster than you, it's not exactly a cakewalk
[10:49] <vede> What difficulty do you play on?
[10:50] <AndrewPH> easiest
[10:50] <vede> Lame.
[10:50] <AndrewPH> it scares me
[10:50] <vede> I played Master difficult and I turned the crosshairs off.
[10:50] <vede> Still too fucking easy.
[10:50] <AndrewPH> I probably should adopt a new playing style
[10:50] <AndrewPH> anyway afk
[10:51] <vede> I actually did that car-park thing in the beginning on that difficult without calling those guys over to help me with it.
[10:51] <AndrewPH> the car park thing was fucking easy
[10:51] <AndrewPH> for some reason I found that turbo easy
[10:51] <vede> Silenced pistol, seven dudes, seven rounds.
[10:52] <vede> Just walked in the front door, watched everyone freak out, then started shooting.
[10:52] <AndrewPH> mine wasn't silenced
[10:53] <vede> Despite all the crazy shit in that game that I could do, I still never beat it because the very last part is insanely hard.
[10:53] <vede> Had to turn the difficult all the way down, and put the crosshairs back on, still couldn't do it.

[10:58] <AndrewPH> oh god damnit
[10:58] <vede> No anomalies, no guys with guns.
[10:58] <AndrewPH> I liked my solution better
[10:58] <AndrewPH> because then a fight broke out

[10:59] <vede> Yeah, you shouldn't have run through.
[10:59] <AndrewPH> why
[10:59] <vede> Because there's a better, less deadly way. And it only costs 500 rubles.
[10:59] <AndrewPH> my way was better
[10:59] <AndrewPH> because they died

[16:52] <Viral> the xbox 'sequel'?
[16:52] <C418> sequel? you mean remake

[16:54] <Viral> Quatroking: I busted that out a few days ago.
[16:54] <Viral> shit was cash
[16:54] <Quatroking> I played it so many times on project64
[16:55] <Viral> by the other day i mean a few weeks back
[16:55] <Viral> p64 is alright
[16:55] <Quatroking> I never got to own a real N64
[16:55] <Viral> but i don't have any usb controllers
[16:55] <Viral> or anything
[16:55] <Quatroking> I have a gamepad so it compensates
[16:55] <Viral> + i love the nostalgia aspect of playing on the actual console
[16:55] <Viral> and nothing can replicate that for me
[16:55] <Quatroking> My Saitek 2600 with rumble support really does well
[16:55] <Quatroking> I LOVE california racing
[16:55] <Speljohan_> <Quatroking> I wished Rare was still working under Nintendo
[16:55] <Speljohan_> reading my mind
[16:56] <Speljohan_> they made the best platformers in history
[16:56] <Viral> eh
[16:56] <Viral> i wish nintendo stopped making games years ago tbh
[16:56] <Viral> they make a few amazing zelda games
[16:56] <Viral> eg oot mm
[16:56] <Viral> remake the same thing
[16:56] <Viral> hundreds of time
[16:56] <Viral> same for mario
[16:56] <Viral> same for pokemon
[16:56] <Quatroking> They went casual, big mistake
[16:56] <Speljohan_> thing is, it works
[16:56] <Viral> the only reason
[16:56] <Speljohan_> i still find the new mario/zelda games as good as the old ones
[16:56] <Quatroking> They'll probably revive later
[16:57] <Viral> you'd buy a new nintendo games
[16:57] <Viral> is if you're a graphics whore
[16:57] <Viral> imho
[16:57] <Speljohan_> wat
[16:57] <Viral> they haven't changed anything core
[16:57] <Speljohan_> ps3/xbox is superior in graphics
[16:57] <Viral> since the originals
[16:57] <Speljohan_> so that doesn't make sense
[16:57] <Speljohan_> :P
[16:57] <Quatroking> pc is superior in graphics
[16:57] <Viral> ^'
[16:57] <Speljohan_> clearly
[16:57] <Speljohan_> but i'm talking consoles
[16:57] <Quatroking> "play your games in HD" I bet half of the games are upscaled
[16:57] <Viral> but i'm just saying
[16:57] <Quatroking> at least GTA IV is
[16:57] <Viral> they haven't brought anything new to any of the franchises
[16:58] <Viral> just remake after remake
[16:58] <Quatroking> Though I have to admit, the new Pokemon Gold and Silver remakes are cash
[16:58] <Viral> ;_;
[16:58] <Viral> i still have my original silver game
[16:58] <Speljohan_> i'd say mario galaxies is pretty damn new
[16:58] <Quatroking> I just love playing the gold story again
[16:58] <Viral> from when i was ~7
[16:58] <Speljohan_> and pretty damn innovative
[16:58] <Viral> oh?
[16:58] <Viral> explains why SMG:2 has a level from sm 64 in it
[16:58] <Viral> EXPLAIN
[16:58] <Viral> EXPLAINNNNNNNNNNNN
[16:58] <Quatroking> the whole gravity concept of galaxy is pretty nice, yes
[16:58] <Viral> because it was brilliant
[16:58] <Viral> that's why
[16:58] <Speljohan_> just the controls and the gravity toys are amazing
[16:58] <Viral> and they're still struggling to remake that perfection
[16:59] <Quatroking> they can't remake the perfection
[16:59] <Speljohan_> to say it isn't something new is pretty silly
[16:59] <Speljohan_> if any genre, the fps genre never innovates
[16:59] <Quatroking> fuck, SM64 caused the N64 to be delayed because they wanted to release it awesome
[16:59] <Viral> how can you?
[16:59] <Viral> although
[16:59] <Viral> i'd like to disagree
[16:59] <Viral> portal is an fps
[16:59] <Viral> puzzle fps
[16:59] <Viral> urban terror has an odd take on fps
[16:59] <Speljohan_> 1 fps out of what, thousands
[16:59] <Viral> with walljumping and sliding
[16:59] <Viral> well yes
[16:59] <Quatroking> Hmm
[16:59] <Speljohan_> vast majority is the same shit
[17:00] <Quatroking> What about Mirror's Edge
[17:00] <Viral> it's not a genre that you can expand on greatly
[17:00] <Speljohan_> anyways i like the mario/zelda franchises
[17:00] <Speljohan_> very much
[17:00] <Quatroking> run bitch run
[17:00] <Viral> lul
[17:00] <Speljohan_> in platformers they can still be quite innovative
[17:00] <Speljohan_> and can be expanded a lot
[17:00] <Viral> braid is one of my fav games
[17:00] <Speljohan_> hell, i'd be happy if they remade sm64
[17:00] <Viral> which is rare for me
[17:00] <Speljohan_> with new maps
[17:00] <Speljohan_> and such
[17:01] <Quatroking> New Super Mario 64: Wii
[17:01] <Viral> ew
[17:01] <Viral> also lolwut
[17:01] <Quatroking> Hmm
[17:01] <Speljohan_> anyways bbl playing ta

[17:01] <Quatroking> I wouldn't mind playing that, if they upped the graphics and added a shitload of extra maps
[17:02] <Viral> i'd probably be bothered by the fact that there's no point remaking it, as they already have a perfectly fine one
[17:02] <Viral> if you're going to bring out a new game in a series
[17:02] <Quatroking> first game I bought with my nintendo points that I had been saving for years: super mario 64
[17:02] <Viral> it has to be compared to the old ones
[17:02] <Viral> Quatroking: go invest in a 64 and some games
[17:02] <Viral> :D
[17:02] <Quatroking> 5 years ago I was saving money to buy an N64
[17:03] <Quatroking> it took me 6 months
[17:03] <Quatroking> then i finally had the money, and I went to the store where they sold one
[17:03] <Quatroking> OUT OF STOCK WE'RE NO LONGER REFILLING
[17:03] <Viral> rofl
[17:03] <Viral> i remember when i got mine
[17:03] <Viral> went for a 2 hr drive
[17:03] <Viral> i was tiny at the time
[17:04] <Viral> there were shelves
[17:04] <Viral> full of them
[17:04] <Viral> awesome black boxes

[19:09] <Marach-18> why does everyone in Earthbound name his character "Ness"?

[19:09] <Quatroking> derp
[19:09] <Marach-18> nope, you can choose from presets or write your own
[19:10] <Quatroking> so what
[19:10] <Marach-18> Ness is one of the presets
[19:10] <TrueWolves`> That's the default name.
[19:10] <Quatroking> the pokemon character is originally called RED
[19:10] <Marach-18> looks like everyone chooses that
[19:10] <Quatroking> yes, in capitals
[19:10] <TrueWolves`> People tend to figure the default name as the canon name
[19:10] <Quatroking> why is link called link if you can change the name in every game
[19:10] <Marach-18> he keeps being called link in some games
[19:11] <Quatroking> no Marach-18.
[19:11] <Quatroking> You are the link in some games.

[19:26] <Quatroking> jesus you're such a dick
[19:26] <Quatroking> with your shitty dell
[19:26] * TrueWolves` never uses /ignore, he just manualy ignores... so he never excludes something that could be importent, like a temp-mibbit user that it's an idiot.
[19:26] <Quatroking> you mibbit discriminator
[19:26] <TrueWolves`> Yeah...
[19:26] <TrueWolves`> Becuase Fox and me are only using it becuase we are at school
[19:26] <Quatroking> (this does not take away the fact that mibbit is shit)
[19:26] <TrueWolves`> -.-
[19:26] <Marach-18> mibbit is fine
[19:26] <TrueWolves`> No it doesn't.
[19:26] <Miclee> Why ignore, then?
[19:27] <Marach-18> but it just happens that 99% of mibbit users turn out to be noobs
[19:27] <Miclee> Notch has used mibbit before.
[19:27] <TrueWolves`> There isn't any noob-users even on right now
[19:27] <TrueWolves`> o.e
[19:27] <Miclee> You callin' him a noob?
[19:27] <Marach-18> i don't come to irc to hear constant ranting
[19:27] <Marach-18> i hope he had to
[19:27] <Marach-18> 99% != 100%
[19:27] <Quatroking> titface
[19:28] <TrueWolves`> The only 2 other people on besides me using it are both idle, Fox is usualy a chatzilla user, and FireTemptest... well I don't know him
[19:28] <TrueWolves`> I still don't understand why people can't manualy ignore, it's not hard to phase out idiots
[19:28] <Marach-18> actually, looking at bildramer, i'm happy i happened to buy something else than a dell
[19:28] <TrueWolves`> I have to do it all the time as a semi-op
[19:28] <ZephyrFox> True, I agree with ya
[19:28] <ZephyrFox> sorry to butt in
[19:28] * TrueWolves` tries really hard not to hit the ban button on blaster
[19:28] <Quatroking> wait bildramer owns a dell too
[19:29] <Marach-18> his cpu begins to overheat on 50% load.
[19:29] <TrueWolves`> eh, Marach can't read what your saying right now Fox.
