[1:09] <Helar> aha starting now i'll say everyone hi
[1:09] <Snowman> I cba to greet individual people

[1:09] <Helar> Hi Demki
[1:09] <So_Useless> Does it lose it's sincerity if he says Hi to everyone, though? Like how I tell customers to have a good night/day/whatever but because that's part of the job.
[1:09] <TrueWolves> It wasn't though.
[1:09] <SumWon> lol
[1:09] <Poikachoika> lol helar, will you say hi out of good will, or because mail did it?
[1:10] <TrueWolves> Becuase it didn't matter if you logged in by a diffrent name.
[1:10] <TrueWolves> If he reconised you he'd say hi.
[1:10] <Demki> I am sailing around my island and I found a rocky area.
[1:10] <VurtualRuler98> so, like
[1:10] <VurtualRuler98> I now have primitive displacements
[1:10] <digitalrushdude> so whats broken about minecraft now?
[1:10] <AndrewPH|School> TrueWolves: Technically bananabot greets everybody :v
[1:10] <VurtualRuler98> to help make the bunker look better
[1:10] <VurtualRuler98> they even visible beyond the skybox brush
[1:10] <SumWon> digitalrushdude, if you die, the game will drop to 1-2 FPS
[1:10] <VurtualRuler98> the downside being I have a tiny bit that just pokes out of nowhere
[1:10] <TrueWolves> Bananabot brags to everybody that it has logs. =D
[1:10] <digitalrushdude> and it borks your save i take it?
[1:11] <SumWon> Even if you restart minecraft, your save game will remain at 1-2
[1:11] <SumWon> Yeah
[1:11] <Poikachoika> maybe the death thing is because the character model now holds blocks?
[1:11] <Demki> wow
[1:11] <SumWon> You will load at the respawn screen each time
[1:11] <Demki> I found something neat
[1:11] <Poikachoika> and when you die, it doesn't know what to do with the blocks?
[1:11] <SumWon> I don't recommend dying right now.

[1:11] <So_Useless> Until it gets fixed. That would be my suggestion.
[1:11] <SumWon> I'M MAKING ONE RIGHT NOW, liq3
[1:11] <digitalrushdude> i play in peaceful anyways
[1:11] <TrueWolves> Alright, logs open.

[1:14] <Zerim> C:\Users\YOURcomputerUSERnameHERE\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves
[1:14] <Snowman> Nevermind
[1:14] <Poikachoika> i was correct about the guy holding onto the item
[1:14] <SumWon> Erm...not oblique....orthagonal
[1:14] <Kodaichi> lol
[1:14] <Snowman> Just the worldx folder
[1:14] <Kodaichi> I love this
[1:14] <Zerim> I think.
[1:14] <Poikachoika> if you die with NOTHING in your hands, it will not lag
[1:14] <Kodaichi> I smack a pig with my hand
[1:14] <TrueWolves> -.-
[1:14] <Poikachoika> it you die with something in your hands, you lag
[1:14] <TrueWolves> This computer is being an asshole.
[1:14] <Kodaichi> It looks at me like "wtf?"
[1:14] <Zerim> D:?
[1:14] <TrueWolves> It's too slow to give me good results.
[1:14] <Poikachoika> because of the new thing notch added where your character holds onto blocks
[1:14] <Snowman> TrueWolves, smash it
[1:14] <Helar> there wasnt lag in their SMP test
[1:15] <SumWon> incorrect, Poikachoika...I think it doesn't make a difference either way.
[1:15] <Poikachoika> i guess no one cares lol
[1:15] <TrueWolves> Yeaaaah, that's a great idea.
[1:15] <Helar> when notch died
[1:15] <So_Useless> I thought it was because of his work on the multiplayer spawning.
[1:15] <Poikachoika> oh someone did care
[1:15] <TrueWolves> Let's smash my only connection to the internet.
[1:15] <SumWon> OH WAIT...nevermind.
[1:15] <Poikachoika> sumwon, i just tested a few times
[1:15] <Snowman> TrueWolves, what's the worst that could happen?
[1:15] <SumWon> Disregard that I suck cocks.

[1:19] <wolf_alex> helar they shouldnt
[1:19] <Snowman> Hey C418
[1:20] <Zerim> and walking on cacti with iron boots or higher will make it not hurt you
[1:20] <Demki> helar, cactus plural is cacti.
[1:20] <Demki> Zerim
[1:20] <Zerim> cloth boots, like the kind TrueWolves has, would hurt you
[1:20] <So_Useless> Listening to bushes and marshmallows right now, oddly enough.

[1:20] <Snowman> I know a joke about cacti

[1:20] <Demki> why not with leather boots?
[1:20] <Snowman> But it only works in Dutch
[1:20] <Zerim> leather? they exisstt?

[1:20] <Demki> XD
[1:20] <TrueWolves> It won't search my files
[1:20] <SumWon> notepad++ is awesome.
[1:20] <Demki> it wierd
[1:20] <TrueWolves> Cloth armor is padded armor
[1:21] <Snowman> Use normal notepad for bloated things
[1:21] <TrueWolves> You get it from wool

[1:21] <Zerim> lol
[1:21] <Helar> pigskin armor!
[1:21] <Zerim> pure logic
[1:21] <So_Useless> Maybe they are a strange breed of mine-sheep that grow extra layers of soft, easily peelable skin rather than wool.

[1:22] <l2623113> fur is murder!
[1:22] <Zerim> that's what I thought it was

[1:22] <Endorphine> Zanny bars and minecraft is win
[1:22] <Zerim> sheep aren't clean, and you sure as hell aren't :D
[1:22] <Demki> I want it cleaned XD
[1:22] <Helar> cacti armor wouldnt last long..
[1:22] <Poikachoika> so, what's all this about cacti?
[1:22] <l2623113> im a murderer >:)
[1:22] <TrueWolves> Fur is useful if you don't want to die in the cold, it's pointless waste of life otherwise.
[1:22] <Snowman> You shit on the wool, obviously.
[1:22] <VurtualRuler98> basically
[1:22] <VurtualRuler98> the cloth armor
[1:22] <VurtualRuler98> is actually leather
[1:22] <Demki> Zerim, my character takes a bath.
[1:22] <VurtualRuler98> because leather materials aren't in

[1:23] <So_Useless> It can't be leather, unless you are skinning the sheep alive.

[1:23] <TrueWolves> Why the fuck do people argue with out reading other's posts. -.-

[1:28] <tj505050> still trying
[1:28] <So_Useless> Hm.
[1:28] <VurtualRuler98> so, basically
[1:28] <VurtualRuler98> we eat meat
[1:28] <Snowman> What happens if you get a boat on land?
[1:28] <Shadaez> TrueWolves also, nutritional yeast
[1:28] <VurtualRuler98> problem solved maggots
[1:28] <TrueWolves> Shadaez, tell that to my dead aunt who thought she could go on a 100% no enriched foods vegan diet. >=/
[1:28] <Quibbles> It breaks
[1:28] <So_Useless> So... we need meat to live. No matter how hard we try to avoid it.
[1:28] <VurtualRuler98> it explodes Snowman
[1:28] <VurtualRuler98> and you take 6d6 stupid damage
[1:28] <TrueWolves> You /can/ eat less meat
[1:28] <Shadaez> TrueWolves she died because she was stupid, not because she was vegan
[1:28] <VurtualRuler98> vegan eating is excessively hard
[1:28] <TrueWolves> The nessary amount of B12 is very small, but it's nessary
[1:29] <So_Useless> Right. Eating less is perfectly reasonable.
[1:29] <VurtualRuler98> and apparently, if you're like Shadaez, and DON'T die
[1:29] <VurtualRuler98> you end up incredibly stupid
[1:29] <VurtualRuler98> like Shadaez
[1:29] <So_Useless> Just saying... meat is pretty much the most delicious.
[1:29] <Shadaez> VurtualRuler98 shush
[1:29] <TrueWolves> B12 is used by the nerve's.
[1:29] <TrueWolves> Which includes the brain...
[1:29] <Zerim> Quibbles, omfg @ 1 min on that video
[1:29] <Zerim> hax

[1:29] <So_Useless> I assume there is a threshhold above which extra b12 is wasted?
[1:29] <Quibbles> Haha, boats always go up water
[1:29] <Snowman> But you can get B12 from bacteria IIRC
[1:29] <Chris220> Minecraft is the most terrifying game I've ever played, and I AM serious

[1:31] <Anon> Meat was esential in human evolution: the development of large brains
[1:31] <Shadaez> VurtualRuler98 I know, I'm vegan
[1:31] <VurtualRuler98> honestly I find it absolutely silly that people are against cow milk
[1:31] <tj505050> how do i find it
[1:31] <Miclee> So are biomes in or not?
[1:31] <VurtualRuler98> Why are you raping your lactose tolerance again?
[1:31] <TrueWolves> Why the fuck do you keep making these asumptions that I just want to go OM NOM NOM NOM PIG FLESH
[1:31] <Scrin> hmm..
[1:31] <So_Useless> Yeah, my understanding was that eating meat helped us evolve our massive, throbbing, central nervous systems.
[1:31] <VurtualRuler98> I, do, infact, want to go OM NOM NOM NOM PIG FLESH
[1:31] <So_Useless> Why turn our back on that?
[1:31] <TrueWolves> The world is more then just /black and white/ god fucking damn it.
[1:32] <VurtualRuler98> On one of my birthdays, I had nothing but meat for lunch, or was it dinner?
[1:32] <Scrin> i loaded my last save and now there are trees growing out of trees :S
[1:32] <Shadaez> TrueWolves me? I'm not, you're saying b12 is so hard to get
[1:32] <VurtualRuler98> Basically, an absurd amount of meat

[1:32] <Demki> miclee, =| go to the wiki and check
[1:32] <TrueWolves> That is a very wide range of ways to get it.
[1:32] <Shadaez> TrueWolves but that isn't true
[1:32] <Scrin> So_Useless, wait, ill upload a screenshot
[1:32] <VurtualRuler98> I vote animal products
[1:33] <Demki> if you really want to know that much
[1:33] <tj505050> ok now what

[1:33] <VurtualRuler98> HOW DARE YOUUUU
[1:33] <Snowman> TrueWolves, actually, animals can't even make B12, it can only be made by bacteria
[1:33] <Poikachoika> see the new blocks he can hold onto?
[1:33] <TrueWolves> But I'm done listening with out those.
[1:33] <Demki> Miclee, so what does it mean?
[1:33] <Poikachoika> that's why
[1:33] <Snowman> So you can get supplements from bacteria
[1:34] <Miclee> It means I'm not sure if I'm just unlucky or if they aren't there.

[1:43] <Poikachoika> and trees
[1:43] <Snowman> Well, I don't go everywhere asking asl
[1:43] <Poikachoika> and animals
[1:43] <Poikachoika> real men don't even need a head for their tool

[1:44] <VurtualRuler98> Yep!
[1:44] <VurtualRuler98> I judge people alright.
[1:44] <TrueWolves|GoneProgramming> The world is more then... just black and white youknow...
[1:44] <VurtualRuler98> Because I'm right, and they're wrong.
[1:44] <So_Useless> Lesbianism isn't a vice, Shadaez.
[1:45] <VurtualRuler98> Because I'm not a coward sissy pansy lady.
[1:45] <So_Useless> It's a service.
[1:45] <TrueWolves|GoneProgramming> There is a middle ground for almost everything.
[1:45] <So_Useless> Heh, kidding.
[1:45] <Snowman> TrueWolves|GoneProgramming, yeah, but only for a few years
[1:45] <Poikachoika> lol truewolves
[1:45] <Shadaez> TrueWolves|GoneProgramming i'm aware
[1:45] <Snowman> Before that, everything was black and white
[1:45] <VurtualRuler98> real men don't even need a head for their "tool", they just have pores all over it
[1:45] <Poikachoika> they have their contrast up too high truewolves

[1:45] <TrueWolves> Cave drawings had shades.
[1:46] <VurtualRuler98> Anciently, it was all black and white
[1:46] <Snowman> If anyone gets that reference
[1:46] <So_Useless> Moderation. It's not just for beers anymore.
[1:46] <Snowman> Which I doubt
[1:46] <TrueWolves> -.- And you know I'm not talking about colors damn it.
[1:46] <VurtualRuler98> Things had a color property to them, but there was only black and white light
[1:46] <VurtualRuler98> Paintings could be done with colored paint, but it was all black and white in appearance

[1:46] <So_Useless> Middle ground: trench warefare, or MORAL DECISIONS?
[1:46] <Anon> oh, hitchhikers guide
[1:47] <VurtualRuler98> paintings became color
[1:47] <Poikachoika> has anyone ever played APB?
[1:47] <Snowman> FINALLY
[1:47] <VurtualRuler98> and photographs were able to recieve color, but old ones were still black and white
[1:47] <Snowman> APB is shit, great concept, badly worked out
[1:47] <VurtualRuler98> mystery solved \o/
[1:47] <Snowman> But ofc, it's EA
[1:47] <Snowman> What would you expect

[1:48] <Poikachoika> i just play with my friends on skype
[1:48] <BnBns> yeah i hated them
[1:48] <Poikachoika> if i play by myself, the game sucks like you said lol
[1:48] <Poikachoika> i do agree that they could have done it better though
[1:48] <Zerim> I play WoW with friends in skype
[1:48] <BnBns> i play with my bros using Mohawk
[1:48] <Zerim> makes it so much better
[1:48] <TrueWolves> eh, don't worry about it Shadaez, I wasn't argueing to be right, just trying to prove the healthiest diet style is not an extream of a lot of meat or a lot of plants.
[1:48] <Snowman> I don't have skype
[1:48] <Shadaez> TrueWolves and I'd have much less of a problem with meat-eaters if they were less like VurtualRuler98 and ate much less meat, since we're apparently eating like 7 times as much
[1:48] <Snowman> Lol, WoW
[1:49] <Snowman> I like meat
[1:49] <Poikachoika> lol i used to play wow

[1:49] <TrueWolves> You can with modren supplements.
[1:49] <Shadaez> I'm pretty sure the healthiest diet is one with a v ery rare consumption of meats
[1:49] <VurtualRuler98> with bit sof bacon in it
[1:49] <AhrenJB> Chairs, tables, etc.

[2:03] <Snowman> <Bonabopn> I didn't know that! But i guess you're right, in spanish "mano" or something means hand.
[2:03] <Piecat> is that what it is???
[2:03] <Snowman> Fuck
[2:03] <Kokopure> FINALLY back home
[2:03] <Piecat> Wait, IS it a cactus?
[2:03] <Snowman> Cause the Spanish and English words totally didn't come from latin?

[2:18] <Snowman> The past is a gaping hole. You try to run from it, but the more you run, the deeper, more terrible it grows behind you, its edges yawning at your heels. Your only chance is to turn around and face it. But it's like looking down into the grave of your love, or kissing the mouth of a gun, a bullet trembling in its dark nest, ready to blow your head off.

[2:24] <liq3> blaster; people don't carry 43 million tonnes of gold IRL either.
[2:25] <blaster> Beaches are not biomes
[2:25] <Poikachoika> he added cacti spawns to sand, and every now and then you'll find an area of large poofy trees
[2:25] <Poikachoika> but that's not exactly a biome
[2:25] <Poikachoika> it's getting there though
[2:25] <Helar> http://www.filepak.com/1/8_map4-normal-day.jpg

[2:31] <VurtualRuler98> and you put these into a two-iron-bar thingy with the crafting menu(up to 3 at a time in your inventory, or 8 at a time with a table) and you craft this with the cannon and it becomes loaded
[2:31] <Quatroking> including two posts of Peri, who somehow is now a moderator

[3:02] <VurtualRuler98> Anyways, anonymity isn't so much for just an individual ability, but something that basically says that you can't become infinitely powerful
[3:02] <Poikachoika> no one goes to 4chan anymore outsomnia
[3:02] <tj505050> lol

[3:20] <SumWon> Perhaps there should be a vote system, so you can thumbs up or thumbs down a server, and the server list could be ordered by best rated servers.
[3:20] <Cial> cant quite get the size right on my screen :/
[3:20] <SumWon> So if an op is abusive, you could vote that server down.
[3:21] <Poikachoika> there will probably be greifers still, just not as many
[3:21] <SumWon> Cial, press F11?
[3:21] <Poikachoika> also, what about people who pirated the game?

[3:21] <tj505050> it down
[3:21] <outsomnia> Rooster: If I brought 10 of my pals in to raid your server, I think OP would help quite a bit.
[3:21] <SumWon> tj505050, you can't spam it down if it's one vote per IP
[3:21] <Poikachoika> good idea SumWon lol
[3:21] <EmpiresBane> no it's not
[3:21] <Rooster> But outsomnia isn't that part of the game?
[3:21] <tj505050> lol
[3:21] <Rooster> To get your bros and raid stuff?
[3:21] <EmpiresBane> the servers at the top get all the votes
[3:22] <EmpiresBane> then anyone below, gets barely any players
[3:22] <SumWon> Fair enough...how about a star rating then?
[3:22] <tj505050> then people would vote big ppl down
[3:22] <Poikachoika> i'm most likely going to have a private server for a while
[3:22] <cavemans> still is common
[3:22] <outsomnia> 10+ against 3 wouldn't be very game-breaking at all, would it?
[3:22] <tj505050> me too
[3:22] <Diablodoct0r> guise
[3:22] <SumWon> You could rate from 1 to 5 stars or something.
[3:22] <Diablodoct0r> I'm bored
[3:22] <Diablodoct0r> And it's your problem nao
[3:22] <SumWon> That way you wouldn't have a server that has a rating of a bajillion over other servers.

[3:23] <Diablodoct0r> I hope Notch makes SMP soon, I'm dying to set up a server
[3:23] <cornelius> it wont let me open the .bat file properly

[3:56] <Askee> Time to burn EVERYTHING
[3:56] <VurtualRuler98> BURN THE WOOOOOOOOOOORLD!
[3:56] <Conundrumer> someone confirm
[3:56] <AzureAngelic> pyro time
[3:56] <BSDeepa> This sorta implies that I'm going to die in a fire very soon
[3:56] <AzureAngelic> ill go check
[3:56] <digitalrushdude> oh wait
[3:56] <Cial> he did AzureAngelic
[3:56] <digitalrushdude> it was just the ground undr the tree
[3:56] <BSDeepa> Someone go die in a fire and report
[3:56] <Askee> :(
[3:56] <digitalrushdude> its still grass
[3:56] * Askee stabs digitalrushdude
[3:57] <digitalrushdude> it lit but it didnt take off
[3:57] <Diablodoct0r> I'll confirm it
[3:57] <Diablodoct0r> once I've built a new world ;)
[3:57] <digitalrushdude> hey, it looked like it was burning
[3:57] <Conundrumer> myth busted
[3:57] <Diablodoct0r> >_>
[3:57] <Diablodoct0r> digital you asshole
[3:57] <Diablodoct0r> were you wrong?
[3:57] <BSDeepa> Speaking of new worlds
[3:57] <digitalrushdude> well its on fire but it dosent burn
[3:57] <BSDeepa> I sent my save file to a friend who says the FPS goes down to 0 and you die whenever you start playing
[3:57] <Diablodoct0r> Do I need to tell you what happens to the misinforming?
[3:57] <digitalrushdude> sure
[3:58] <Diablodoct0r> BSDeepa: If you use the client, that happens
[3:58] <AzureAngelic> also
[3:58] <AzureAngelic> boats are too fragile
[3:58] <BSDeepa> It doesn't happen to me because I can't play until my account is fixed :D
[3:58] <AzureAngelic> i dont mind when i crash into an island and it explodes
[3:58] <SumWon> Smoke.
[3:58] * Awoken (sindrebj91@88.84.49.132) has joined #minecraft
[3:58] <Poikachoika> maybe if the boats took three hits to break?
[3:58] <BSDeepa> Reckon savegame editing can fix it or will I have to make a new world?
[3:58] <AzureAngelic> but when i jump out of a boat, my guy lands on it again, pushing it forward into solid ground
[3:58] <VurtualRuler98> boats should have hp
[3:59] <AzureAngelic> boats shouldnt break if you arent in them imo
[3:59] <VurtualRuler98> and a 2.5 hearts to 1 heart ratio of damage to you
[3:59] <AzureAngelic> or that
[3:59] <VurtualRuler98> so you lose 4 hearts in total from impacts
[3:59] <AzureAngelic> also i just set my view distance to far
[3:59] <VurtualRuler98> before a normal, weak boat breaks
[3:59] <AzureAngelic> and i just now noticed the mountain a few feet away is leaking
[3:59] <BSDeepa> leaking?
[4:00] <Diablodoct0r> Boats should turn into inflatable dildos when right-clicked 99 times
[4:00] <Diablodoct0r> easter egg
[4:00] <VurtualRuler98> of what size?
[4:00] <VurtualRuler98> Human?
[4:00] <EmpiresBane> fucking russian... i can't understand a thing they're saying
[4:00] <Diablodoct0r> or.. easter dildo

[4:02] <AzureAngelic> man, whales must be really good at deep-throating
[4:02] <Conundrumer> boat+waterfalls are the closest thing to it
[4:02] <Diablodoct0r> Awoken here, had sex with a whale
[4:02] <Diablodoct0r> He can confirm every detail
[4:02] <Rooster> Was anyone else suprised when they found out the President in Fallout 3 was a robot.
[4:02] <Awoken> Use loads of lube.
[4:02] <VurtualRuler98> When questioned, the whale only said "bbyeeewwwwwwwhhhhhmmmmhhhh"

[4:05] <Diablodoct0r> 1.0.6 Is full of bugs

[4:06] <Diablodoct0r> Trees don't drop to sapplings
[4:06] <Diablodoct0r> >_>
[4:06] <digitalrushdude> i wonder if creepers timers have been fixed
[4:06] <VurtualRuler98> so wait
[4:06] <AzureAngelic> there are no bugs in 1.0.6

[4:43] <Poikachoika> all of that stuff about windows 7 can be changed
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> No, it can not.
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> I checked.
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> Read the entire post
[4:43] <Diablodoct0r> :p
[4:43] <Poikachoika> also the networking thing about 7 is great
[4:43] <Poikachoika> :P
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> eh?
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> networking?
[4:44] <Poikachoika> you can easily link up computers on homegroup
[4:44] <Askee> Clearly you never used vista
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> yeah
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> Aske..
[4:44] <Askee> Or you would murder yourself for that post
[4:44] <Poikachoika> lol yes i have
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> This furcking PC is Vista
[4:44] <Poikachoika> i'm not thinking right now
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> It's 6 years old now
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> I mean 4
[4:44] <Askee> Murder
[4:44] <Askee> Yourself

[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> Read the post Poik
[4:44] <Poikachoika> never mind lol
[4:44] <Diablodoct0r> :p
[4:44] <Poikachoika> i was reading it
[4:45] <Poikachoika> i just said the homegroup thing before i went to go read it
[4:45] <Askee> If you can't see the taskbar, YOUR EYES ARE FUCKED
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> Dude
[4:45] <slowriot> wow, "easily linking up computers"
[4:45] <slowriot> welcome to 1994
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> Haha ^
[4:45] <slowriot> you fucking square
[4:45] <Poikachoika> man
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> OWNED
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> Also,
[4:45] <Poikachoika> you don't know what i mean
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> Tell me right here and now
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> How to make my taskbar black
[4:45] <Poikachoika> and i don't feel like explaining it
[4:45] <Quatroking> Okay guys
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> WITHOUT making the entire windows layout black
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> Like the Vista one
[4:45] <Diablodoct0r> Tell me that
[4:46] <Quatroking> What do I do when I want to report a post but a moderator is abusing his power and protects the rulebreaker
[4:46] <Poikachoika> i don't know if vista could do it, but i know that with 7, all i have to do is go to the network menu and drag files to put them onto my other computer without actually connecting a cable
[4:46] <Askee> So your whole arguement for win7 sucking is that you can't visually customise it as much?
[4:46] <Askee> FAILURE!
[4:46] <Quatroking> and breaks a rule himself twice
[4:46] <Diablodoct0r> Quatroking: Turn to another OP
[4:46] <Poikachoika> though i noticed it works on my friend's vista
[4:46] <Diablodoct0r> ASkee
[4:46] <Diablodoct0r> Read my entire post
[4:46] <Poikachoika> so it probably works for vista as well
[4:46] <Quatroking> Yeah. Well, thats kinda hard when the forum is moderated by that single abusive moderator, eh
[4:46] <Askee> Also, I turned off the firewall just fine :P
[4:46] <Diablodoct0r> There are lots of arguments
[4:47] <Diablodoct0r> Yes, you managed to, but a Vista user didn't.
[4:47] <Quatroking> I should keep lists of this
[4:47] <Diablodoct0r> That indicates a "feature not intuitive"
[4:47] <Diablodoct0r> Which means, a feature people won't learn
[4:47] <Diablodoct0r> and therefore not use
[4:47] <Poikachoika> yeah the firewall came off easily, and yeah Diablodoct0r i actually respect you for looking at the bad AND the good lol
[4:47] <Diablodoct0r> and therefore, worthless
[4:47] <Poikachoika> most people just say it sucks

[4:49] <Diablodoct0r> Yes
[4:49] <Diablodoct0r> And that annoys me
[4:49] <Quatroking> I remember getting my first computer

[4:49] <Quatroking> My dad bought me Doom
[4:49] <Quatroking> my mom yelled at my dad a lot that day
[4:49] <Askee> It annoys you to easily transfer files?

[4:50] <Diablodoct0r> >_>
[4:50] <digitalrushdude> not the same

[4:51] <slowriot> sorry, what the fuck is a lan network without any cables?
[4:51] <slowriot> a wan network perhaps?
[4:51] <Diablodoct0r> ^
[4:51] <Poikachoika> all i know is that when my friend comes over and needs a file, i see his computer in my network folder and i just throw shit in his public folder
[4:51] <Diablodoct0r> Yes
[4:51] <Diablodoct0r> apparently
[4:52] <slowriot> yeah, so next time you're in starbucks or something
[4:52] <Askee> No, a LAN without any cables is either wireless, or non existant
[4:52] <Diablodoct0r> That's called Folder Sharing
[4:52] <Diablodoct0r> And it's possible in XP
[4:52] <slowriot> that kid in the black tshirt in the corner with the stickers on the back of his laptop
[4:52] <SumWon> Pfft, gameboy used Unix. You could do it on there too.
[4:52] <slowriot> he's reading your documents

[4:52] <Diablodoct0r> :p
[4:52] <Diablodoct0r> Anyways,
[4:52] <Diablodoct0r> I hate the design on Win7
[4:52] <BSDeepa> Poikachoika: we did that at a LAN
[4:52] <slowriot> because you don't understand the basic concept of data security, and windows encourages you to just connect everything to everything and damn the consequences
[4:52] <Diablodoct0r> And the fact that the theming and customizability is screwed up
[4:52] <Diablodoct0r> But I love the wallpaper backgrounds
[4:52] <BSDeepa> we had a dump of /b/ on 80GB
[4:52] <Diablodoct0r> And the new windows sounds
[4:53] <BSDeepa> and we uploaded that to all public folders
[4:53] <Poikachoika> lol nice
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> And.. I'm getting accustomed to that Apple-like bar at the top of the screen
[4:53] <BSDeepa> CONSTANTLY
[4:53] <Askee> I think thats the ONLY thing I agree with you on Diablodoct0r, not being able to change taskbar color seperatly XD
[4:53] <Poikachoika> i wish /b/ was good again
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> Askee: Good, let's make babies :)
[4:53] <Askee> no
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> okay
[4:53] <Askee> Wait, what apple like bar?
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> The erm
[4:53] <BSDeepa> And suddenly one guys snaps, stands up and screams with a voice demanding blood "WHO THE HELL IS PUTTING THAT FUCKING SHIT IN MY COMPUTER?"
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> Dock
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> Thing
[4:53] <Poikachoika> ahahha
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> OH
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> THATS RIGHT
[4:53] <O_E> im assuming the windows dock.. you can disable that
[4:53] <Diablodoct0r> It only comes with Dell
[4:53] <Poikachoika> sfsdfj
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> doesn't it?
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> xD
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> At least Dell provides it
[4:54] <Askee> oh
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> tehehe
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> DELL OWNS
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> DONT DISS
[4:54] <Askee> I build all my own computers :D
[4:54] <Poikachoika> the college i wanted to go to was talking about giving me a dell laptop
[4:54] <Poikachoika> and i was like FUUUU
[4:54] <Askee> lol
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> This is a Laptop Askee
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> lol
[4:54] <Askee> I could've built my laptop too
[4:54] <digitalrushdude> HAH
[4:54] <Poikachoika> mainly because my laptop is better
[4:54] <O_E> i personally dont like Dell.. too much bloatware
[4:54] <Askee> But I was lazy
[4:54] <Poikachoika> and they were like "oh you can take that then"
[4:54] <digitalrushdude> made it out :D
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> bloatware = ?

[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> what is bloatware..
[4:54] <Poikachoika> a lot of useless software
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> Oh
[4:54] <Poikachoika> packed into the computer
[4:54] <Poikachoika> lol
[4:54] <Diablodoct0r> Well, Toshiba has more
[4:55] <Askee> I got my laptop from HP, reformated and installed a CLEAN windows
[4:55] <Poikachoika> HP has a bit too
[4:55] <digitalrushdude> i hate prebuilts
[4:55] <EmpiresBane> HP has a lot
[4:55] <Diablodoct0r> But once you've removed the useless shit, it becomes quite comfy
[4:55] <Poikachoika> hey, anyone know where i could get a 280m for my laptop?
[4:55] <O_E> that is true.. toshiba does have more, but the problem is that it is manditory bloatware..
[4:55] <Poikachoika> i've looked fucking everywhere
[4:55] <Poikachoika> and i really want one

[4:55] <Askee> On the right side menu thingy
[4:55] <Diablodoct0r> I will reply
[4:56] <digitalrushdude> whats really fun is when they integrate it into the hardware, so if you dont have the bloat ware, you cant do shit with the computer
[4:56] <Diablodoct0r> Askee: Tried
[4:56] <VurtualRuler98> DF has snow too, now.
[4:56] <Diablodoct0r> Didn't work

[4:56] <Diablodoct0r> Well
[4:56] <Askee> Because I'm looking at it right now
[4:56] <Diablodoct0r> It came with McAfee
[4:56] <Diablodoct0r> Maybe that's the reason
[4:56] <Askee> That would explain it...
[4:56] <Askee> McAfee sucks floppy dicks
[4:56] <EmpiresBane> not really...
[4:56] <VurtualRuler98> I've thrown snow, too
[4:56] <So_Useless> Ugh... McAfee.
[4:56] <O_E> wait... McAfee? that exists still?
[4:56] <VurtualRuler98> dangerously, of course
[4:56] <Askee> Its kept me from FIXING a computer
[4:57] <So_Useless> My machine came with it. I used it for about two weeks and then deleted it for avast.
[4:57] <EmpiresBane> i have McAfee (don't judge me) and i can get to windows firewall
[4:57] <So_Useless> So annoying.
[4:57] <digitalrushdude> i still think the virus makers and the antivirus makers are part of the same big mafia
[4:57] <Keiya> I just saw rule34 of the Invisible Pink Unicorn
[4:57] <Askee> lol
[4:57] <Diablodoct0r> ASkee: Agreed
[4:57] <Poikachoika> wat
[4:57] <Askee> <3 Avast!
[4:57] <Diablodoct0r> McAfee is horrible

[4:57] <Diablodoct0r> :D
[4:57] <Diablodoct0r> KIS 2010
[4:57] <Askee> kaspersky is good too I hear
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> it is
[4:58] <BnBns> ESET
[4:58] <SumWon> I USE NORTON LOL
[4:58] <digitalrushdude> only thing i dont like is the lack of on-access scanning
[4:58] <EmpiresBane> digitalrushdude, anti-virus companies hire virus developers after they've done their time
[4:58] <O_E> i dont know of any other IS that works better than kaspersky..
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> No problems with it, and it takes all kinds of threats
[4:58] <Askee> avg aswell
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> omg not norton
[4:58] <O_E> LOL, NORTON..
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> for the love of god
[4:58] <BnBns> norton...
[4:58] <Poikachoika> norton is horrible
[4:58] <Jesse> Norton is the best wutchoo talkin bout
[4:58] <SumWon> I know right
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> I used to have Norton
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> Jesse x
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> xD
[4:58] <BSDeepa> But Norton isn't the worst
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> really?
[4:58] <Askee> norton and mcafee are the two worse AV EVER
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> ^
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> AGreed
[4:58] <BnBns> this one time, i sat on a huge shard of glass. It was comparable to my expiriences with norton
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> I had both
[4:58] <digitalrushdude> norton came with this comp, im just waiting for the subscrition to run out...
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> Lmao
[4:58] <Jesse> I use norton and mcafee
[4:58] <Jesse> double the security
[4:58] <Poikachoika> D:
[4:58] <Diablodoct0r> digital: uninstall already
[4:58] <Askee> LOL
[4:58] <O_E> i think 2 years ago, i found a list of the top 100 Antivirus programs currently out there, and Norton was like 87
[4:58] <BSDeepa> Anyone recall using Norman around '03?
[4:59] <Diablodoct0r> get Kaspersky
[4:59] <Poikachoika> double the slowness
[4:59] <EmpiresBane> they would delete eachother
[4:59] <Poikachoika> lol
[4:59] <SumWon> BnBns, one time I sat on a jar and recorded it breaking in my ass. It was comparable to my experiences with Norton.
[4:59] <digitalrushdude> why? already paid for it with the comp, once it runs out im getting rid of it
[4:59] <BnBns> haha
[4:59] <Poikachoika> haha SumWon
[4:59] <O_E> norton is like wearing a broken condom for sex..
[4:59] <EmpiresBane> i had Norton on an old system once...
[4:59] <So_Useless> I can't watch that video. The thought of it...
[5:00] <So_Useless> I watched two girls one cup with no problem, but jars breaking in asses... too much.
[5:00] <Poikachoika> norton is like breaking your computer with a hammer
[5:00] <Poikachoika> it's the same thing
[5:00] <Jesse> digital I totally see where you're coming from this one time I bought a car with bad brakes but I figured
[5:00] <Jesse> I already payed for the car
[5:00] <SumWon> I laughed while watching it tbh
[5:00] <Askee> So I installed Avast! on a cousins computer
[5:00] <Jesse> So I might as well use it anyway
[5:00] <SumWon> Laughed hard
[5:00] <EmpiresBane> tried using 800mb out of the 512mb of Ram i had
[5:00] <Askee> And my uncle went and had her install norton too...
[5:00] * Askee STABS!
[5:00] <Diablodoct0r> I heard avast was okay
[5:00] <BnBns> I went on lastmeasure. It was comparable to my expiriences with norton
[5:00] <Poikachoika> anyone here have parents that install retarded shit and go to websites like "finallyfast.com" ?
[5:00] <Diablodoct0r> I prefer Kaspersky though
[5:00] <Kom|Gone> I don't like avast
[5:00] <digitalrushdude> i watched that vid. it didnt do much to me. i guess im jaded
[5:00] * Kom|Gone is now known as Kom
[5:00] <VurtualRuler98> Poikachoika almost

[5:00] <Diablodoct0r> hahaha
[5:00] <VurtualRuler98> let alone even do something ilke USE TWO TABS IN FIREFOX
[5:00] <SumWon> EmpiresBane. that's what virtual memory is for :D
[5:00] <BnBns> swap.avi /thread
[5:00] <Poikachoika> DUDE
[5:00] <O_E> uhh. speaking of parents installing random garbage onto a computer..
[5:01] <Poikachoika> my dad uses IE and opens a new window for each thing he wants to do
[5:01] <VurtualRuler98> my mom holds down a key for a long time
[5:01] <VurtualRuler98> result:
[5:01] <EmpiresBane> SumWon, it's an antivirus thing
[5:01] <VurtualRuler98> Opens fifty tabs
[5:01] <DEElekgolo> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrtYeSj3EDQ
[5:01] <Poikachoika> haha
[5:01] <VurtualRuler98> and then complains that I broke their computer

[5:01] <digitalrushdude> lol
[5:01] <Poikachoika> lol
[5:01] <Diablodoct0r> Lol
[5:01] <EmpiresBane> i won't be able to get viruses if i can't use my computer
[5:01] <Askee> lol
[5:01] <O_E> my friend's parents installed on their computer: Norton Ghost 2003, McAfee, NOD32, and other "security" programs that basically made it so the computer couldnt run

[5:01] <Quatroking> install norman
[5:01] <VurtualRuler98> they use firefox
[5:01] <VurtualRuler98> but don't know how touse tabs
[5:01] <VurtualRuler98> they just leave open LOADS of windows
[5:01] <SumWon> Fail
[5:02] <VurtualRuler98> forever
[5:02] <So_Useless> My mom messes up her computer all the time. To make matters worse, she uses a trackball mouse. So, when she asks me to fix it, I have to go figure out what's wrong while dealing with that infernal piece of garbage.
[5:02] <SumWon> Thank god my parents are comptuer retards..
[5:02] <VurtualRuler98> and then don't realize it slows it down
[5:02] <Quatroking> norman antivirus destroys so much viruses it even attacks its own database
[5:02] <VurtualRuler98> when we told tem to not overcharge the battery
[5:02] <Quatroking> (true story)
[5:02] <VurtualRuler98> they let the battery die
[5:02] <SumWon> They had a bbs running in the early-mid 90s
[5:02] <VurtualRuler98> and then couldn't turn on the laptop
[5:02] <BnBns> My nan plugged the phone cable into her printer
[5:02] <BoxcarJim> can anyone here help with a problem with the "goto" command on an opencraft server?
[5:02] <Poikachoika> i told my parents to use firefox and they're like "i just like IE more" even though they never gave FF a chance
[5:02] <VurtualRuler98> because they got the brick unplugged
[5:02] <O_E> now, i may not know a lot about firefox and IE, but im assuming that opening new tabs is less memory than opening new windows
[5:02] <Poikachoika> BoxcarJim: you use /tp not goto
[5:02] <VurtualRuler98> O_E, it's also more usable
[5:02] <Quatroking> Poikachoika, I just got rid of IE and all other microsoft apps

[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> OpenOffice FTW
[5:03] <Poikachoika> not sure about that, most i know about changing worlds is changing the map name
[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> And erm
[5:03] <O_E> hell, i use tabs all the time.. i only use windows when i have more than 1 project going at the same time
[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> FireFox is awesome
[5:03] <So_Useless> I assume I shall be ridiculed for admitting that I prefer chrome.
[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> But lately it's been slow

[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> Chrome..
[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> dude
[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> no
[5:03] <SumWon> My neighbours wanted help making their computers faster. I got on them, uninstalled IE, and installed FF. They have been happy with me ever since.
[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> just..
[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> go
[5:03] <So_Useless> I have firefox installed and use it for things that chrome sucks at.
[5:03] <SumWon> I shit you not, that's all I did
[5:03] <Diablodoct0r> >_>
[5:03] <Quatroking> chrome is okay, I just don't like the lack of options
[5:03] <Jesse> QWhat's wrong with Chrome?
[5:03] <BnBns> chome is pro

[5:04] <Diablodoct0r> Jesse

[5:04] <BnBns> shange*

[5:04] <VurtualRuler98> and I find out I play now! with a spear and a carving knife
[5:04] <slowriot> ever tried to print preview in chrome?
[5:04] <BnBns> change** wtf

[5:04] <Diablodoct0r> Technically
[5:04] <Quatroking> jesus I use that feature all the time when printing
[5:04] <Diablodoct0r> But then FireFox

[5:11] <Diablodoct0r> They're more good than bad
[5:11] <Askee> ???
[5:11] <Diablodoct0r> And other articles are more colored by one expert's point of view
[5:11] <O_E> i dont believe in Wiki because too many people i know thinks wiki is the ultimate definative source of information and anything not posted on wiki is not true..
[5:11] <Diablodoct0r> aka they're one-sided

[5:26] <Axaj> yes
[5:26] <BitOP> after x "uses" it breaks
[5:27] <Axaj> but I assume that the breaking thing is a result of incomplete programming

[5:28] <BSDeepa> and then just have it sink on it :D
[5:28] <TrueWolves> Stone boats lol.
[5:28] <BitOP> or gold
[5:29] <TrueWolves> diamonds are accualy quite light
[5:29] <TrueWolves> ... infact I wonder if diamonds would float...
[5:29] <BSDeepa> I'm still convinced that they do not float
[5:29] <BitOP> make the main body out of diamonds
[5:29] <TrueWolves> Diamond is about as light as wood, a diamond boat would float.
[5:29] <BitOP> then put wood around the edges

[5:30] <Red_Link> how's everybody doing?

[5:30] <Diablodoct0r> TrueWolves: Their material makes it very much harder than regular metal, I believe
[5:30] <Red_Link> haven't tried that
[5:30] <ZzZGuy> diablo, why would a higher density object float in a lower density liquid?
[5:30] <Poikachoika> aw man, i finished my water ride and apparently it's too thin
[5:30] <Red_Link> question:
[5:30] <Poikachoika> so i need to go through and re-do all of it
[5:30] <Red_Link> does anybody have a good method for finding dungeons?
[5:30] <Diablodoct0r> That's my question ZZZ
[5:30] <Red_Link> I haven't seen ANY
[5:30] <Diablodoct0r> High density = no float
[5:30] <Red_Link> and I've searched and searched and searched...
[5:30] <TrueWolves> We make armor out of diamonds, I'm sure we can make floating boxes out of diamonds.
[5:31] <Diablodoct0r> Low density = lots of air bubbles = float
[5:31] <Diablodoct0r> like wood
[5:31] <Red_Link> true: no
[5:31] <Poikachoika> red, just look in a lot of caves
[5:31] <Poikachoika> lol
[5:31] <Red_Link> arbot we make armor out of bunches of things
[5:31] <TrueWolves> Alright, how do we get iron ships to float. =/
[5:31] <Red_Link> but it doesn't have to float
[5:31] <TrueWolves> By displacement.
[5:31] <Red_Link> we have VERY large air bubbles...
[5:31] <Annihilator> there's... ships?
[5:31] <Red_Link> lol
[5:31] <Poikachoika> TrueWolves: they're full of air
[5:31] <Poikachoika> lol
[5:31] <TrueWolves> Tell me why this can't apply to diamond boats?
[5:31] <Diablodoct0r> Iron ships are built on very strict principles
[5:31] <Red_Link> it could
[5:31] <Red_Link> but with a LOT more air
[5:31] <Diablodoct0r> But they still float relatively better than diamond
[5:31] <Red_Link> and has to be very balanced
[5:32] <Diablodoct0r> All materials can float, but the higher the density, the much harder it gets
[5:32] <Diablodoct0r> You have to have amazing constructions to make diamond float
[5:32] <Poikachoika> notch was talking about using obsidian as magic stone
[5:32] * TrueWolves goes to do some research. -.-;
[5:32] <Poikachoika> you could just put that in your boat
[5:32] <Poikachoika> bam, floating diamond boat
[5:32] <BitOP> how about sheeps blood
[5:33] <Poikachoika> that's the fuel
[5:33] <EmpiresBane> erm...
[5:33] <Vicrry> yey
[5:33] * So_AFK is now known as So_Useless
[5:33] <EmpiresBane> wouldn't diamond boats break easily?
[5:33] <TrueWolves> Alright
[5:33] <Vicrry> what you research TW?
[5:33] <Poikachoika> lol EmpiresBane, wat
[5:33] <BitOP> put red sheep blocks back in. put them in something to get blood out. get one regulare cloth back and a couple of blood blocks
[5:33] <TrueWolves> Just did some research, diamonds are half the weight/density of iron
[5:33] <EmpiresBane> Poikachoika, go learn about diamonds
[5:34] <Vicrry> liquid mercury. Hard to get something to sink in it
[5:34] <Poikachoika> i'm just going by the assumption that diamonds don't break easily
[5:34] <Diablodoct0r> Oh really?
[5:34] <Diablodoct0r> That doesn't make sense
[5:34] <BitOP> why not make a boat out of oil
[5:34] <EmpiresBane> Poikachoika, they're very brittle
[5:34] <So_Useless> Diamonds are half the density of iron? I thought diamonds were one of the most dense things on earth.
[5:34] * Soviet (Administra@av098188.reshsg.uci.edu) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[5:34] <ZzZGuy> Well, first you have to cast a diamond boat, or else you have to latch/glue it all togehter, so there is a weak link making a diamond boat useless.
[5:34] <Diablodoct0r> They HAVE to have a higher density, since they are the hardest and most pressurized material on earth
[5:34] <ZzZGuy> or not worth it.
[5:34] <Diablodoct0r> TrueWolves: Where did you read this?
[5:34] <Poikachoika> i guess they would be brittle if they were used in mass, like on a boat
[5:34] <So_Useless> Or was it just toughest?
[5:34] <Diablodoct0r> Wiki?
[5:34] <EmpiresBane> Diablodoct0r, NO
[5:34] <DDRJake> animals only spawn on grass?
[5:34] <Vicrry> Diamonds the hardest on earth
[5:34] <Diablodoct0r> ^
[5:34] <DDRJake> fanTASTIC
[5:34] <Diablodoct0r> They are.
[5:34] <DDRJake> my crops are safe
[5:34] <Diablodoct0r> They break easily, but they are hardest
[5:34] <EmpiresBane> the crystal structure is what make them hard
[5:34] <So_Useless> I see.
[5:35] <TrueWolves> Diamond Density: 3.5gcm^3, iron Density7.9gcm^3
[5:35] <So_Useless> Right.
[5:35] <Poikachoika> i would assume they'd be easier to break if you had them spread over a large surface area
[5:35] <Diablodoct0r> Oh
[5:35] <Diablodoct0r> The structure
[5:35] <EmpiresBane> not the density
[5:35] <Vicrry> But hardness and density have nothing to do with each other
[5:35] <So_Useless> Right. I was confusing density with hardness. Because I am derpderpderp.
[5:35] <BitOP> i've had some sheeps/pigs spawn on regular dirt blocks
[5:35] <Diablodoct0r> okay

[5:35] <Diablodoct0r> If they have that structure
[5:35] <TrueWolves> So
[5:35] <Diablodoct0r> Thanks, TrueWolves
[5:35] <Diablodoct0r> I didn't know that
[5:35] <TrueWolves> I ask again, if you do the structure right, what stops a diamond boat?
[5:35] <Poikachoika> yeah, i didn't know diamonds were that light either
[5:35] <Diablodoct0r> Well..
[5:35] <Vicrry> Lead - REALLY dense. Really soft. Diamond: Really hard, Really light
[5:35] * Red_Link (Tuna@d1-98.rt-bras.pell.centurytel.net) has left #minecraft
[5:35] <Vicrry> also
[5:36] <Vicrry> An iceberg would stop a diamond boat
[5:36] <TrueWolves> ...
[5:36] <TrueWolves> <3 you Vicrry.
[5:36] <Poikachoika> lol
[5:36] <Diablodoct0r> Yes
[5:36] <ZzZGuy> i was thinking of a diamon floating like a ice clube, not a boat. A diamond bost should flot, but first you have to cast it and GL doing that.
[5:36] <Diablodoct0r> Diamond breaks easily
[5:36] <So_Useless> Well. If you can make metal float by displacing enough water, there shouldn't be anything stopping you from making a diamond boat.
[5:36] <Poikachoika> a diamondberg would stop any boat
[5:36] <ZzZGuy> *boat
[5:36] <Diablodoct0r> Dude
[5:36] <So_Useless> Except for the rarity of diamonds.
[5:36] <Vicrry> *Bonk* OMFG The cracks everywhere!
[5:36] <Diablodoct0r> You can break diamond by a metal hammer easily
[5:36] <VurtualRuler98> I feel claustrophobic still
[5:36] <VurtualRuler98> after messing around with wanderer's friend
[5:36] <EmpiresBane> well... making a diamond would be hard
[5:36] <VurtualRuler98> that mod makes me cry
[5:36] <Poikachoika> i guess that makes sense
[5:36] <ZzZGuy> so_useless, we can mass produce diamonds.
[5:36] <Poikachoika> you just can't cut it
[5:36] <Diablodoct0r> EmpiresBane: Detonate a few atomic bombs and you got Diamond
[5:37] <EmpiresBane> kinda hard to sculpt diamond
[5:37] <Poikachoika> hard to cut, easy to smash
[5:37] <Poikachoika> lol
[5:37] <Vicrry> Making metal float is hard. Making air float by wrapping metal around it is easy :P
[5:37] <EmpiresBane> Diablodoct0r, that's not the only way
[5:37] <So_Useless> Are synthetic diamonds as hard as naturally occuring ones?
[5:37] <TrueWolves> Diamonds however would /not/ float on water normaly.
[5:37] <BitOP> damn it's annoying to work underwater at night
[5:37] <ZzZGuy> so_useless, no idea
[5:37] <TrueWolves> So Useless, mostly.

[5:37] * Diablodoct0r (bdyddoc@193.71.126.90) Quit (Quit: Leader of Love doesn't "need". He just takes.)
[5:37] <TrueWolves> They may be harder/softer by tiny tiny amounts depending on impurities induced.
[5:37] <ZzZGuy> synthetic diamonds are often used for cutting blades.
[5:37] * exe-_ (d@bbservice14.mmpnet215.tnp.pl) has joined #minecraft
[5:38] <Poikachoika> i never thought i'd learn so much about diamonds by hanging out in an IRC
[5:38] <DDRJake> ;_; what use is my boat in winter?
[5:38] <Poikachoika> DDRJake: a sled
[5:38] <TrueWolves> And infact there are techniques to make diamonds that are harder then normal diamonds syntheticly, but it only makes tiny diamonds (which does make them good for industrial use)
[5:38] <So_Useless> So, you could circumvent the problems with making a diamond boat by making synthetic ones? I wonder what the size limitations are.
[5:38] <Vicrry> I'd imagine synthetics are harder - synthetics tend to be grown under perfect conditions so they have fewer imperfections.
[5:38] <TrueWolves> Synthetic diamonds are usualy small.
[5:38] <So_Useless> I see.
[5:38] <DDRJake> it breaks then it hits ice =(
[5:38] <TrueWolves> MineCraft diamonds are Huge
[5:38] <SumWon> ...Why would a regular diamond float on water lmao.
[5:39] <So_Useless> Is it an intrinsic part of the synthesizing process that makes them small or just a limitation of the technology?
[5:39] <Poikachoika> lol DDRJake i wasn't serious :P
[5:39] <Poikachoika> sorry to mislead
[5:39] <TrueWolves> A diamond wouldn't float on water normaly, but with the structure of a boat it should.
[5:39] <ZzZGuy> Once again, to make a diamond boat you'd need to make a SINGLE diamond in the shape you want, or else glue/lash them together and then the glue/lashing is the weak link making the diamonds pointless.
[5:39] <Vicrry> Also, diamond boats would be useless cause they're be really fragile :)
[5:39] <TrueWolves> Limitation of the technology mostly, we can make decent sized ones, but nothing special.
[5:39] <SumWon> Carve a diamond boat using diamon knives
[5:39] <SumWon> Duh

[5:39] <TrueWolves> Also, we are talking about minecraft diamond boats.
[5:40] <So_Useless> Well... we could make an icebreaker with a diamond blade/breaker thing on the front eventually.
[5:40] <Poikachoika> yes lol
[5:40] <TrueWolves> Not real life diamond boats which are so impossible in so many ways it's not funny.
[5:40] <ZzZGuy> sumwon, ok, you make the diamond :p
[5:40] <Vicrry> A single crystal diamond boat would be your best option, but m3h :P
[5:40] <SumWon> Make it? Screw that. I'm off to Africa to FIND it
[5:40] <DDRJake> diamond boats?
[5:40] <SumWon> Imma find a diamond as big as a door.
[5:40] <SumWon> And then I shall float on it.

[5:41] <EmpiresBane> this bug thing in Singularity reminds me of Cloverfield
[5:41] <Poikachoika> i wish we could combine doors in the workbench to make bigger doors
[5:41] <SumWon> haha
[5:41] <Poikachoika> huge castle gates would be the best
[5:41] <BitOP> i thought those new torch things could work underwater ;_;
[5:41] <ZzZGuy> a block of steel will sink, shape that steel to have a large hallow space in the middle & prevent water from getting in and you have a boat.
[5:41] <ZzZGuy> or at least something that floats.
[5:41] <Vicrry> Best idea ever. I'ma make a boat out of solid cast iron. Then make a giant pool of mercury, and then float on my hunk of solid iron. :)
[5:41] <So_Useless> Where will you get that much mercury?
[5:42] <Vicrry> not importants
[5:42] <Vicrry> I IS ON A BOAT! :P

[6:35] <Raws> I don't trust them, though
[6:35] <Animator> Seriously, I push them forward, and one they so much as touch something else, BAM, I get sticks and wood.
[6:35] <SumWon> To be honest, I just wish the whole world spoke the same language. I don't give a crap what language...it would just be nice to be rid of language barriers.
[6:35] <BitOP> and get pissed at me cause of the exchange
[6:35] <VurtualRuler98> what do those mean BSDeepa

[6:48] <xikkub> is the new mczall free release working for anyone
[6:48] <BitOP> depends on the area
[6:48] <xikkub> i love gravel
[6:48] <Subhazard> 'I'm fine, I'm taking a couple buckets of air with me'
[6:48] <Villor> it works for me
[6:48] <BitOP> my area is 16x53x10
[6:49] <Villor> but i got some problems
[6:49] <BitOP> that's 8480 blocks
[6:49] <xikkub> anything special you needed to get it to work?

[6:49] <xikkub> it crashes nonstop for me. cant even get it working
[6:49] <xikkub> ah
[6:49] <BitOP> only had the dirt since i'm doing about a 30x30 quarry to the bottom of the map
[6:49] <xikkub> so mysql is a prerequisite?
[6:49] <Subhazard> So can anyone confirm for me if death bug is fixed yet? After you die I hear the fps drops to like.. 1
[6:49] <Villor> yes
[6:49] <Kokopure> Subhazard

[6:50] <So_Useless> Curb your ambitions for a bit.
[6:50] <xikkub> @bitop, thats real clever
[6:50] <Kokopure> if it's a super friggin' terrible bug Notch'll fix it tomorrow.
[6:50] <SumWon> Showing that it's probably related to the new feature that shows your currently held item in your hand.
[6:51] <xikkub> @sumwon i dont think that can be handled
[6:51] <Kokopure> start a new level and die, see what happens.
[6:51] <BitOP> if you're haphazardly falling off edges like that it's your own fault

[6:53] <Subhazard> I only get offended by peoples intentions, not their words.
[6:53] <So_Useless> I dunno. I just didn't think of calling something something gay as being offensive. Maybe I am the prejudiced one and was putting that on Xikkub.

[7:24] <robocop408> hullo
[7:24] <VurtualRuler98> what if we had integrated circuit blocks

[7:24] <Subhazard> Already been suggested Vurtual
[7:24] <Subhazard> Got shot down.
[7:24] <VurtualRuler98> and
[7:24] <VurtualRuler98> they created heat blocks
[7:24] <VurtualRuler98> and then if the heat blocks aren't pushed away
[7:24] <VurtualRuler98> it produces a magic smoke block
[7:24] <VurtualRuler98> and becomes useless material
[7:24] <BitOP> why don't we just make lazer eyes
[7:24] <robocop408> circuit blocks got shot down?

[7:25] <l2623113> how about portable TV blocks
[7:25] <So_Useless> And a jetpack.
[7:25] <SumWon> Yeah
[7:25] <Subhazard> This girl who's staying with me is going on a date with this guy
[7:25] <Vicrry> A way of making a simple door lock take up less room than 6 city blocks got shot down?
[7:25] <SumWon> I prefer just more natural shit
[7:25] <BitOP> if we replace our legs with robot legs
[7:25] <SumWon> Kinda girl next door sorta thing
[7:25] <Jat> someone told me notch did it this way because he doesnt want people to focus too much on making really complicated things
[7:25] <McCloud> Hey guys, is there a trick to finding the spawners?
[7:25] <Subhazard> and she's putting on like a pound of makeup, and she's already pretty without it.
[7:25] <BitOP> jetpacks would be more feasible
[7:25] * AndrewPH|AFK is now known as AndrewPH
[7:25] <BitOP> but noooo
[7:25] <BitOP> robot legs are stupid
[7:25] <SumWon> The whole glamorous thing caked with makeup doesn't do it for me.
[7:26] <TrueWolves> Hey, does anyone on have the link to that alchemy game?

[7:26] <SumWon> Also, you can no longer get spawner blocks.
[7:26] <SumWon> If you destroy a spawner, it's gone.
[7:26] <SumWon> You cannot move it.
[7:26] <Dark207> dungeon hunting with cartographer is damn fun
[7:26] <So_Useless> Not that I look any better than the people I hate.
[7:26] <xjiro> are treetops not withering for anyone else
[7:26] <Jat> speaking of alchemy and online games does anyone else here play elements?
[7:26] <Subhazard> If I could move a mob spawner, oh the fun I would have
[7:27] <Subhazard> I would stick it in my mob spawning room next to my mob murderer

[7:28] <Subhazard> It's complicated to explain in text.
[7:28] <Subhazard> But
[7:28] <Subhazard> You need to make a giant dark room
[7:28] <SumWon> Elements?
[7:28] <SumWon> The card game?
[7:29] <Subhazard> That's the first step
[7:29] <Subhazard> Then you create a drop off about 5 blocks down
[7:29] <Subhazard> wall it off with glass
[7:29] <Prime_Intellect> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qym7XbQ7ApE&playnext_from=SL&playnext=2
[7:29] <Subhazard> then on the other side of the wall you make some waterfalls
[7:29] <McCloud> Need to make a new entity for otash
[7:29] <Subhazard> Stand on one side of the glass so the mobs come after you
[7:29] <McCloud> potash
[7:29] <Subhazard> but then they get stuck in the water and drown, and their items flow underneath the glass
[7:29] <McCloud> buren organic material
[7:29] <Subhazard> Put it on hard, you'll have mobs COMPETING for space to get killed in
[7:30] <Subhazard> I've gotten 12 gunpowder in one pull
[7:30] <So_Useless> I see.
[7:30] <SumWon> WELL, brb. I'm off to crap...I ate a habanero yesterday, and a ton of jalapenos...wish me luck...

[7:30] <McCloud> do creeper spawners exist?

[7:30] <SumWon> Imma grab a fire extinguisher..
[7:30] <Shrub> I can't look at Janet Jackson without remembering Michael ;-;
[7:31] <SumWon> Nah, I'm already making a generator.

[8:05] <mnjiman> Dark207 thats cool
[8:06] <BitOP> cause that's the way it is
[8:06] <BitOP> it'd look awkward any other way since it doesn't rotate in the sky
[8:06] <BitOP> also http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmJw8Tm7TZw
[8:06] <SumWon> I should make a virus that detects all browsers on your system and if your main/only browser is IE, it installs FF, makes it default. Then the virus would spread and delete itself from your system.
[8:06] <Grumb> You guys talking about Skullkids texture pack?
[8:07] <Dark207> lol
[8:07] <mnjiman> But i use Chrome
[8:07] <SumWon> and makes it default*

[8:07] <EmpiresBane> no
[8:07] <SumWon> Well, if you have Chrome it'll leave you alone lol

[8:39] <TrueWolves> Does no one understand how Currency works these days becuase of paper money?
[8:39] <Gonads> That's why stuff gets made in China etc.

[9:15] <TehButter> o.o

[9:17] <TehButter> Cacti was implemented
[9:17] <II_OE_II> really? thats awesome
[9:17] <TehButter> in the latest update
[9:17] <TehButter> if you stand on it
[9:17] <TehButter> you take damage
[9:17] <II_OE_II> wonder what its good for though >.>
[9:17] <TehButter> if you hit it
[9:17] <TehButter> damage
[9:17] <Tukiko> It's good for mob traps!
[9:17] <BitOP> if you want seekrit underwater base with ladder find the spot you want the ladder to go. place it on the wall. Flood the area a couple of blocks above the ladder, don't place a source water above the ladder spot. if done right it'll flood over everything so you can go through a bit of water to a dark ladder down to base :3
[9:17] <TehButter> ^
[9:17] <II_OE_II> lolz
[9:17] <dumjom> it does really low damage though
[9:17] <II_OE_II> hell, force spawn people into a box of cacti
[9:17] <II_OE_II> >.<
[9:17] <dumjom> i stood on it with a full set of diamond armor and rarely ever took damage
[9:17] <Tukiko> lol
[9:18] <TehButter> its diamond armor
[9:18] <TehButter> do you really thing
[9:18] <TehButter> little cactus needles
[9:18] <Prime_Intellect> haha
[9:18] <TehButter> will pierce diamond armor?
[9:18] <TehButter> WTF?
[9:18] <TehButter> think*
[9:18] <OpalMist> Just imagine, though, making a maze of cactus as a trap, and using yourself as bait, standing in the ceter of it, you just know there'll be a skeleton as opposed to anything else that comes along, then you have to navigate the maze fratically to escape
[9:18] <TehButter> Actually,
[9:18] <TehButter> you have to stand ON cacti
[9:18] <TehButter> to take damage
[9:18] <TehButter> touching the side does nothing

[9:19] <TrueWolves> 1024 player worlds
[9:19] <IceFlinger> that sounds like a dangerous mistake
[9:19] <Tukiko> NO
[9:19] <TehButter> That would be
[9:19] <TrueWolves> like, /real/ worlds with player made towns.
[9:19] <Tukiko> NO TRUEWOLVES

[9:19] <TrueWolves> Note: 6~9 years
[9:19] <TehButter> CAKE
[9:19] <TehButter> Real = cake
[9:19] <TehButter> Yes
[9:19] <TrueWolves> Lag won't be as much of a problem.
[9:19] <TehButter> good point
[9:19] <IceFlinger> runescape is java, and it's an MMO
[9:19] <II_OE_II> anyone else here play on hard?
[9:19] <TrueWolves> Oh god that be horible now...

[9:20] <Dark207> oh wait
[9:20] <Dark207> tnt CAN explode underwater
[9:20] <TrueWolves> 5~8, 6~9, not much of a diffrence.

[9:21] <TehButter> anyway
[9:21] <TehButter> II
[9:21] <TehButter> To re-grow trees,
[9:21] <TehButter> you have to destroy leaves

[9:21] <TehButter> Then you place a bush in an open area
[9:21] <Tukiko> TehButter: I sense a TrueWolves kicking. Might want to use longer posts..
[9:21] <TehButter> and give it lots of light...
[9:21] <TehButter> Sorry... its a habit >.>
[9:21] <II_OE_II> thats it? damn thats simple..
[9:22] <TehButter> Yeah
[9:22] <TehButter> It takes a long while though
[9:22] <II_OE_II> okay, im off to plant a rainforest now >.>
[9:22] <II_OE_II> thanks :)
[9:22] <TehButter> Good luck XD
[9:22] <TehButter> (random thought: rainforest biome would be win)
[9:23] <OpalMist> At this stage, I imagine setting fire to the remaining leaves could be the easiest way to go.
[9:23] <BitOP> rain would be nice again
[9:23] <BitOP> i hope that comes back in next friday ;_;
[9:23] <TehButter> Ooh, yeah
[9:23] <TehButter> almost forgot about rain
[9:23] <OpalMist> and I reckon that you should only get saplings when you manually destroy leaves
[9:23] <TehButter> did notch ever actually put it in survival?

[9:23] <Poikachoika> setting fire to the leaves gets you no bushes back
[9:23] <TehButter> I only used it in creative...
[9:23] <BitOP> iunno
[9:23] <OpalMist> Because having a mess of saplings appear as the leaves automatically disappear is irritatig
[9:23] <BitOP> i remember it thoguh
[9:24] <OpalMist> not that they disappear on their own, now
[9:24] <OpalMist> But.
[9:24] <Tukiko> Fire is probably the best way to go if you don't need the saplings. Also you can generally get large areas of tires on fire with the huge trees now. I have an area with almost a full canopy.
[9:24] <TehButter> It was in creative, bitOP
[9:24] <Poikachoika> yeah i usually used fire to get rid of trees when i didn't want saplings

[9:51] <Visiiri> light never goes through portals.
[9:51] <vede> ie. place the painting, remove the two blocks behind it, place torches.

[9:56] <Cial> /sarcasm
[9:56] <TehButter> But
[9:56] <Poikachoika> the way i learned expression 2 was by reading a huge list of variables and trying them all out; is there anything similar to that for java?
[9:56] <II_OE_II> oh.. i have a suggestion to add to the box to possibly be implemented in the game.... remove the durp eyes from critters?
[9:56] <Tukiko> Man, I want to go in Oblivion and fill my house with wine again.
[9:56] <TehButter> I expect Notch to also add the ability to punt chickins
[9:56] <TehButter> Like in fable

[10:04] <TrueWolves> Some places have a lot, some have none.
[10:04] <TrueWolves> Usualy you find caves near by other caves.

[10:04] <Poikachoika> oh in caves, nevermind
[10:05] <Poikachoika> cartograph has helped me a whole lot when i got lost outside
[10:05] <lolcat> they stretch all the way to the bottom, with lava and water falls everywhere
[10:05] <II_OE_II> o.O
[10:05] <AzKay> So, I end up in a huuuuuge cave with torches down every tunnel, not knowing where I was going
[10:05] <II_OE_II> cartograph?
[10:05] <lolcat> and tons of diamonds *eyes sparkle??
[10:05] <AzKay> Helps if you have a stream or waterfall to follow back

[10:14] <AzKay> I meant to say Company, olol
[10:15] <vede> It's scary as fuck, sure, until you realize that the game is basically a ridiculously hard trial-and-error game with a horror-game suit on.
[10:15] <vede> At least, the first one is. I've heard the later games fixed that problem mostly.
[10:15] <TehButter> Oh yeah
[10:15] <TehButter> The first one, once i got over my fear of the wolves and learned how to kill them,
[10:15] <TehButter> there was no more scary
[10:16] <TehButter> I could just take my weapon and beat them down
[10:16] <TehButter> The second one, you dont get weapons
[10:16] <TehButter> But the monsters are too easy to avoid

[10:55] <Dark207> i found a lava bug
[10:55] <Subhazard> :P

[10:56] <Subhazard> I'm calm
[10:56] <II_OE_II> lava bug you say?
[10:56] <Subhazard> The caps are a bi-product, like a burp
[10:56] <Rooster> Caps = obvious intense anger
[10:56] <Dark207> You can make never ending streems :D
[10:56] <Dark207> with no 'source'
[10:56] <Chadsweb> Balls is a nice word to substitute for just about anything
[10:56] <II_OE_II> le gasp! i thought that got removed last patch
[10:56] <Chadsweb> Almost like smurf
[10:56] <Dark207> you spam it, spam putting the lava down, spam taking it, spam taking it back
[10:56] <Dark207> keeeeep gooooing
[10:56] <Dark207> then
[10:56] <Dark207> if yer lucky
[10:56] <Dark207> you got
[10:56] <Dark207> epic lava
[10:56] <Dark207> thats only killable if u place blocks over all of it
[10:56] <Subhazard> I really hope notch never fixes the infinite water glitch
[10:57] <Chadsweb> Does epic lava mean infinite or something like an explosion happens?
[10:57] <Subhazard> that shit is so useful
[10:57] <xjiro> no need to spam it
[10:57] <Dark207> infinite
[10:57] <Chadsweb> Oh that's cool
[10:57] <II_OE_II> well, if it is an infinite source, then i found a new way to light my catacombs >.>
[10:57] <AzKay> Infinite water glitch?
[10:57] <Chadsweb> Definitely a nice trick to learn I guess
[10:57] <Dark207> also
[10:57] <xjiro> cant you just get water infinitely from a still source

[10:58] <xjiro> that is not an ore or diamond
[10:58] <vede> xjiro, cloth.
[10:58] <II_OE_II> now how is that in any way logical.. water turns lava into obsidian, but torches can destroy water?
[10:58] <xjiro> CLOTH
[10:58] <Dark207> rofl
[10:58] <Dark207> :D
[10:58] <xjiro> i never would have got that

[10:59] <Dark207> its only obsidian if you place it directly into water btw
[10:59] <Dark207> and it kills the lava source
[10:59] <Dark207> so its hard to get obsidian
[10:59] <Dark207> and its super hard to pick it up
[10:59] <Askee> Oh yeah, thats the old cloth
[10:59] <Dark207> takes 3 years to mine it
[10:59] <Askee> That I ALWAYS confused with stone :|
[10:59] <II_OE_II> heh.. ive seen a friend mine that stuff.. it looks tough
[10:59] <Chadsweb> Yeah cloth should be made a little whiter or something
[11:00] <Askee> It was :p
[11:00] <Chadsweb> Oh well I still can't tell much
[11:00] <Askee> ...
[11:00] <Chadsweb> Yeah I'm a little blind/stupid
[11:00] <Askee> lol
[11:01] <Chadsweb> Or it might just be intelligence that is so above that of normal men that it is impossible to comprehend
[11:01] <Chadsweb> But probably not
[11:01] <Rooster> I wonder if in the future, people will look back and consider "your mom" jokes funny.

[11:07] <vede> So there's this kid in my school who's always drawing little dudes in a notebook, and when anyone asks him what they are he says he's making a video game. I figured he was the average "lol i can make games cuz i like playing games" kid, so I decided to ask him if he'd made any other games. "Yeah." he says. I ask how he made it. ie. language, graphics library, etc. He says that he just found a bunch of computer parts and put them together
[11:07] <vede> and made a game.

[11:30] <Gonads> Simple
[11:30] <Grumb> When they ask it, say yes.
[11:30] <Subhazard> I'm seriously about to say 'yes'
[11:30] <Gonads> Date girls who are over: 15 :P
[11:30] <Gonads> Whoops :P
[11:30] <Grumb> And that :)
[11:30] <Subhazard> I'm not dating this girl
[11:30] <Animator> Hm.

[11:31] <Animator> I see.

[11:33] <Tukiko> Cold cuts <3
[11:33] <Gonads> you need a jacket in this heat?
[11:33] <Animator> You could also direct her attention to a different conversation.
[11:33] <Tukiko> Goands: Sandwiches are the result of cold cuts and bread
[11:33] <Tukiko> gonads*
[11:34] <Animator> Like, say yes really fast and then mention something that's actually important.
[11:34] <Gonads> I usually don't cut myself when making sandwhich
[11:34] <Gonads> but okay :D
[11:34] <Subhazard> Haha animator

[11:34] <Tukiko> Fail

[11:36] <AndrewPH> Tukiko, YOU WOULDNT DOWNLOAD A BABY

[11:36] <Tukiko> I'd download a baby.
[11:36] <AndrewPH> OK MAYBE YOU WOULD BUT I WOULDNT
[11:36] <Tukiko> How else will I get lunch?
[11:37] <Subhazard> I'd steal a car if I could get away with it, but the logistics are all whacked.
[11:37] <Subhazard> I'd never steal from a person though
[11:37] <Subhazard> that's my number one rule, never steal from someone or something where you're actually going to hurt them
[11:37] <Tukiko> Then you wouldn't steal a car
[11:37] <Subhazard> Dealership
[11:37] <Tukiko> Is owned by a person
[11:37] <Tukiko> Derp
[11:37] <Subhazard> No
[11:37] <KrimZon> yeah think of old Gill you bastard
[11:37] <Subhazard> cars in a dealership are owned by a corporation
[11:37] <KrimZon> trying to close the deal
[11:37] <Tukiko> Corporation is owned by people
[11:38] <Subhazard> DONT EVEN START WITH THAT SHIT
[11:38] <Gonads> Subhazard: Car salesmen are subhuman filth. You heard it here first!
[11:38] <Subhazard> YOU'RE JUST BEING CONTRARY
[11:38] <Tukiko> You started it with your hypocritical statements!
[11:38] <Subhazard> Did the salesmen go out and buy the cars? No
[11:38] <Subhazard> They didn't.
[11:38] <Grumb> Some guy in my town stole a test car
[11:38] <Grumb> but he left his car at the caryard
[11:38] <Dark207> uh
[11:38] <Subhazard> The corporation supplied the dealership with a car to sell.
[11:38] <Grumb> and it had his business papers and shit in his car
[11:38] <Subhazard> They didn't go out and buy a car to sell.
[11:38] <Dark207> what's with the caps and cussing
[11:38] <Grumb> so it had his name all through it
[11:38] <awex> I put an iron door in my house... how to open it?
[11:38] <Grumb> So, he's a fucking idiot
[11:38] <Grumb> Why not Dark?
[11:38] <Dark207> Awex
[11:38] <Dark207> you need to put a lever near it
[11:38] <awex> yo
[11:38] <Dark207> or a button
[11:38] <Dark207> or a pressure plate
[11:39] <awex> ok
[11:39] <Gonads> awex: You need a button, or a redstone circuit
[11:39] <awex> like, next to it on the wall?
[11:39] <Dark207> yeah
[11:39] <Gonads> Yep
[11:39] <awex> kthnx
[11:39] <Gonads> Adjactent square
[11:39] <Dark207> that's the only way
[11:39] <Tukiko> Subhazard: A corporation is not run by robots, it's run by humans. Therefore some people bought cars for a person who owns a dealership to sell.
[11:39] <Subhazard> No
[11:39] <Subhazard> They fucking -made- the cars
[11:39] <Tukiko> So you're stiealing from people
[11:39] <Subhazard> Thousands of them
[11:39] <Subhazard> every day
[11:39] <Tukiko> So if I make a sandwich and you take it, it's not stealing?
[11:39] <Gonads> Ah and because they make lots its okay to steal.
[11:39] <Gonads> I get it
[11:39] <Subhazard> And the only person who would suffer, would be a negligible amount on the company, we're talking fractions of a fraction.
[11:39] <DEElekgolo> http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/8042/spiderv.png
[11:39] <DEElekgolo> just made this
[11:40] <Gonads> Subhazard: By your logic, thus everybody should steal and no one would suffer.
[11:40] <Subhazard> Yes
[11:40] <Subhazard> That does make it okay to steal.
[11:40] <Tukiko> Subhazard: Don't go Office Space on me when you're failing
[11:40] <Gonads> Amazing logistics you have there boyo.
[11:40] <Tukiko> buoy*
[11:40] <Tukiko> Fixed
[11:40] <Gonads> Get a job, grow up.
[11:40] <AzKay> O cool an argument
[11:40] <Subhazard> You haven't rebuttled me
[11:40] <AzKay> Whats the topic of discussion?
[11:40] <Subhazard> You just patronized me, try again bucko.
[11:40] <Subhazard> rebutted*
[11:41] <Dark207> not sure
[11:41] <Dark207> something about stealing and cars
[11:41] <Tukiko> lol
[11:41] <AzKay> O nice
[11:41] <Gonads> Subhazard: I don't need to rebutt your argument because there is none. Thus the patronizing statements.
[11:41] <Subhazard> We're discussing the morality of theft when it comes to large faceless corporations.
[11:41] <AzKay> O
[11:41] <AzKay> Its awwwright
[11:41] <AzKay> Microsawft; Windows
[11:41] <AzKay> Its awwwright to steal it.
[11:41] <AzKay> SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
[11:41] <Tukiko> Subhazard doesn't think that stealing a car is stealing from a person if it came from a dealership, so I pointed out that corporations and dealerships are run by people so he is stealing. Then he started spouting nonsense about how since they're rich it's okay to steal from them.
[11:42] <Subhazard> The sheer amount of evil and fuckery your average corp generates is rarely offset by the products they produce.
[11:42] <Rooster> Read thread, lol at my stupidity

[11:42] <Subhazard> That's not what I said.
[11:42] <sorre> >implying everything a business owns is not insured
[11:42] <Tukiko> Subhazard: When losing an argument, blame the "faceless corporations"
[11:42] <Gonads> Subhazard: You know that most car dealerships are like small time people. That's why it says for example "Mike's Mercedes Dealership" or something. So if you steal this car you're stealing from mike. Who bought the car (albeit for less than he'd sell it for) -- in hopes to make profit. So in your world, how is this not hurting him? And how is it hurting Mercedes? Explain!
[11:42] <sorre> mike makes an insurance claim
[11:42] <sorre> he loses nothing
[11:42] <Subhazard> I said that the dealers at the company do not own the cars, they did not buy them, and whether or not the cars are there tomorrow has no effect on their employment or their pay. They have insurance, they get compensated, it doesn't matter to them.
[11:43] <Dark207> I feel sorry for whoever has a job to read stuff like this:
[11:43] <Dark207> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode
[11:43] <sorre> and considering how quick insurance companies are to not pay up anytime something catastrophic happens
[11:43] <sorre> they can fuck off
[11:43] <Gonads> sorre: and then the insurance raises the annual payments, and everybody pays for the car because boyo is too cool to pay for it, bro
[11:43] <AzKay> Some people read that for fun
[11:43] <Subhazard> No if it's a multinational corporation
[11:43] <Subhazard> not*
[11:44] <Tukiko> sorre: Mike has to wait a long to for insurance claim to go through and has to go through an investigation. Meanwhile his business stagnates because some prick stole a car. :P
[11:44] <Subhazard> The way an insurance company deals with a corporation and how it deals with an individual is vastly different.

[11:51] <Rooster> Is it so much to ask for one non-custom server?
[11:51] <Gonads> I can put one up if you want.
[11:51] <mnjiman> what the heck is the argument. It must be really important to start attacking each other's lives
[11:51] <mnjiman> right?
[11:51] <mnjiman> right?
[11:51] <Gonads> I have a pretty good connection but I might be very far away from you.
[11:52] <Tukiko> mnjiman: I dunno what the argument was. It ended on post 2. :V

[12:32] <Subhazard> tl;dr?
[12:32] <Subhazard> Maybe it's my personality that brings it out in women
[12:32] <Subhazard> They want to tell me every god damn thing.
[12:33] <Subhazard> Sometimes I like that :3
[12:33] <Subhazard> sometimes though, stfu
[12:33] <Gonads> Weird - they usually doze of before I do

[12:38] <AzKay> 1ghz om nom nom
[12:39] <Snake> Droid X has a 1GHz processor.
[12:39] <Snake> :D
[12:39] <AzKay> Yeah, but N900 runs linux
[12:39] <Subhazard> I want basically an ipod/android app that's basically a minecraft encyclopedia, updating in synch with the minecraft wiki!
[12:39] <Shadaez> and it wouldn't run Minecraft
[12:39] <AzKay> so you can install java straight up
[12:39] <Snake> I'm getting it the 25th.
[12:39] <Subhazard> BASICALLY
[12:39] <AzKay> like, full java
[12:39] <Subhazard> Seriously who wouldn't find that awesome.
[12:39] <Snake> Droid X still probably couldn't run it
[12:39] <AzKay> N900 you can apt-get
[12:39] <AzKay> om nom
[12:39] <Subhazard> To have a minecraft encyclopedia on your phone.

[12:46] <Snake> Is that with or without taxes?
[12:46] <Subhazard> IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR A REASON
[12:46] <Shadaez> Snake no it's not the screen size, it's just a really good SW keyboard, multitouch. The weird other mode where you don't lift your finger up is amazing too
[12:46] <Shadaez> I'm going to put it on my phone, too
[12:46] <Grumb> I hate it D; haha. Ah, I have a plan anyway.
[12:47] <Snake> Yeah, but screen size makes it not condensed
[12:47] <Snake> And easier to use
[12:47] <Phil> how can you not lift your finger?
[12:47] <Phil> hjow that work?
[12:47] <Shadaez> IDk what it's called

[13:03] <Snake> AT&T doesn't have unlimited data.
[13:04] <Shadaez> sadly, T-Mobile must be the best carrier now :\
[13:04] <Snake> Lolno
[13:04] <emgmod> I heard T-Mobile might go under in a year.

[13:34] <Grumb> The younger one is Epileptic D:
[13:34] <Jaska-> you can't teach cats they're assholes :D

[13:34] <Koppis> Dogs are like babies, they need care all the time
[13:35] <Grumb> Yeah.
[13:35] <TrueWolves> Depends on the breed of dog, but that is mostly true.
[13:35] <Grumb> I much rather cats, but I'm allergic, which sucks.
[13:35] <Jaska-> yeah, thats why dogs are great
[13:35] <Shadaez> Grumb so am I, get over it! :P
[13:35] <Koppis> But cats need almost nothing, they're almost the easiest pet to have

[13:36] <TrueWolves> Allergies are weird like that.

[13:36] <TrueWolves> They can pop up sometimes with out noticable warning
[13:36] <Shadaez> I don't know how they work

[13:44] <Grumb> I don't really mind these forums...
[13:44] <Folis> I have a nice desktop background ...
[13:44] <Grumb> It seems a large percentage of Minecraft are persistent at researching the game, and there is little immaturity on Alpha board.
[13:45] <Folis> I don't look at the forums at all
[13:45] <Shadaez> oh god wtf
[13:46] <TrueWolves> I was surprised by my turn out when asking for research for my poll for a school essay, and not one troll o.O

[13:54] <TrueWolves> yeah usualy.
[13:55] <Shadaez> unless you're a failboat at forwarding ports, yeah
[13:55] <Dark207> it's not always port forwarding
[13:55] <Koppis> Dark207: do you get an error or something?
[13:55] <AzKay> I dont see how people have trouble forwarding ports

[13:55] <Koppis> I have dd-wrt on my router XD muxh more control
[13:55] <AzKay> O u
[13:55] <Koppis> much*
[13:56] <Jaska-> AzKay, most of the routers ppl use are bricked with bad firmware
[13:56] <Jaska-> that makes it hard to port forward :\
[13:56] <Shadaez> FAILED2CONNECT
[13:56] <Dark207> exactly
[13:56] <Koppis> Jaska- that's why I installed a different firmware on mine
[13:56] <Dark207> it freezes my broswer
[13:56] <Dark207> browser
[13:56] <Jaska-> heh, thats why I haven't updated mine :D
[13:56] <Shadaez> Dark207 you didn't forward ports right, that is all
[13:56] <AzKay> I have a cable modem/router from ISP
[13:56] <Jaska-> latest fw update bricked the port forward
[13:56] <AzKay> If I buy a seperate cable modem alone, so I can get a linksys
[13:57] <TrueWolves> Also, what happened to the comment troll bob? did someone take my bounty on him?
[13:57] <Koppis> :/
[13:57] <AzKay> I have to pay $90 for them to update my MAC detauls

[13:57] <Shadaez> AzKay disable DHCP on your isp router and get a new one and bridge it or whatever
[13:58] <Jaska-> bridged mode is the easiest.. but its also very dangerous o_O
[13:58] <AzKay> Wouldnt work anyway, problem with this router/modem is if it gets too many connections
[13:58] <Koppis> I don't think you should bridge it
[13:58] <AzKay> it commits suicide

[13:58] <awex> 6060
[13:58] <Koppis> It seems you can just choose your own here
[13:58] <Jaska-> it was pain in the ass to configure my linux server firewall settings for every software
[13:58] <Koppis> okay
[13:59] <gdude2002> Koppis: 25565
[13:59] <awex> *1337
[13:59] <Koppis> 25565?
[13:59] <Koppis> >_>
[13:59] <Shadaez> that's default I think
[13:59] <gdude2002> the config is defaulted to 25565
[13:59] <Koppis> ok.
[13:59] <Dark207> argh
[14:00] <AzKay> So yeah, if I torrent theres 80% chance of my modem/router to kill itself
[14:00] <Shadaez> my router also sucks :\
[14:00] <Dark207> wth is Notchbot
[14:00] <AzKay> even if I get a linksys, it wont help
[14:00] <Jaska-> lower the connection limit?
[14:00] <AzKay> Because the problem will still be there
[14:00] <Shadaez> I need to learn how to make a linux PC into a router
[14:00] <AzKay> Yeah, but then it sacrifices speed
[14:00] <AzKay> SPEEEEEED
[14:00] <Jaska-> nah..
[14:00] <Dark207> Duurggggz?
[14:00] <Grumb> Why is there so many people that just sit in IRC but never talk?
[14:00] <Dark207> they're evil
[14:00] <Dark207> we must kill them.
[14:01] <AzKay> I couldnt even use a PC as a router unless I found a card for it to support cable interwebz
[14:01] <Jaska-> Because its interesting to watch other people
[14:01] <Jaska-> lurking here and watching you write...

[14:01] <Grumb> I'd rather contribute to a conversation.
[14:01] <Shadaez> your router probably lags because it's routing everything
[14:01] <Jaska-> Koppis, Java not regonized as command?
[14:01] <Jaska-> or what are you doing :P
[14:01] <Shadaez> disable DHCP and only connect one thing to it into a new router and that will probably go away
[14:01] <AzKay> o

[14:09] <TrueWolves> if you die
[14:09] <TrueWolves> your corpse holds on to your items... which the game doesn't understand quite right
[14:09] <Dark207> what could be the problem :/
[14:09] <TrueWolves> Java goes OMNOMNOM MEMORY becuase it thinks if it keeps eating all your memory it can solve the problem
[14:09] <TrueWolves> It works about as well as it sounds.

[14:09] <Dark207> can someone help
[14:09] <Dark207> T_T

[14:44] <[JD]> but I'll just avoid playing dangerous untill its fixed
[14:44] <Ominus> rawr
[14:45] <rcfighter> The dying glitch makes me glad I had my worlds backed up on a USB drive.
[14:45] <AzKay> Build an inffarm
[14:45] <Ominus> well i did start a new map in hopes of biomes but i dont think theyre in yet?
[14:45] <Koakuma> What is the death bug?
[14:45] <Budda> u die ur save dies
[14:45] <[JD]> if you die, your pretty much perma dead
[14:45] <Koakuma> Oh
[14:45] <rcfighter> Dying causes a ton of lag.
[14:45] <Koakuma> That's horrible
[14:45] <Ominus> you get 0fps after respawn
[14:45] <epaGamer> ominus theres desert
[14:45] <[JD]> you get 1fps on your save until you edit it
[14:46] <Koakuma> So it's hard mode minecraft
[14:46] <[JD]> basically
[14:46] <rcfighter> And you lose EVERYTHING in your inventory
[14:46] <Ominus> yay desert!!! must find!!
[14:46] <Koakuma> That happens anyway
[14:46] <Budda> duhh
[14:46] <Budda> you die
[14:46] <[JD]> well, it still drops on the ground
[14:46] <[JD]> but
[14:46] <rcfighter> You can't even go back and pick it up.
[14:46] <[JD]> you get one fps after you die
[14:46] <Budda> ye u can
[14:46] <epaGamer> ominus but the deserts are small now
[14:46] <rcfighter> When it happened to me, all my stuff was gone from the location i died at
[14:46] <epaGamer> maybe notch will make them bigger
[14:46] <[JD]> because your body is on dragging on the ground or something
[14:46] <[JD]> orly?
[14:46] <Koakuma> I never had items drop when I died
[14:46] <epaGamer> but now are small and u can collect cacti
[14:47] <Koakuma> Although now that I think about it, I've never died to anything other than lava
[14:47] <[JD]> i think they go two blocks down
[14:47] <[JD]> on this bug
[14:47] <Ominus> rawr
[14:47] <[JD]> yeah, lava eats things
[14:47] <[JD]> it goes om nom nom - tools
[14:47] <[JD]> =D
[14:47] <Ominus> i want an area covered with gravel and lava springs everywhere with a layer of obsidian before the bedrock!

[16:23] <Ominus> if were going for realism then once you die in a game the game locks itself and you can never play it again, now THAT is realism
[16:23] <Pelum> how strange was the zebra thing crawling out of the vagina wall

[16:23] <liq3> Realism often makes for fun mechanics tho.
[16:23] <visiON> >violence
[16:23] <Drakkar> well other than minecraft?
[16:23] <AzKay> Its funny in FPS games when people complain about realism
[16:23] <Shrub> Minecraft has violence?
[16:23] <Drakkar> because its sandboxy and has violence
[16:23] <Drakkar> yes
[16:24] <Drakkar> you can hit sheep with shovels
[16:24] <Drakkar> how is that not violent
[16:24] <AzKay> Because then a company makes a realistic FPS; one shot kills, manual reloading, etcetc
[16:24] <BlueWafflez> minecraft needs a gore mod
[16:24] <Shrub> fuck that's hilarious
[16:24] <NGgod> i like the dildo in GTA SA
[16:24] <Drakkar> sure its funny
[16:24] <AzKay> then no one plays it and says its too realistic
[16:24] <Drakkar> but its also violence
[16:24] <Shrub> I wish Minecraft had high definition sheep faces

[16:24] <visiON> GTA
[16:24] <visiON> or something

[16:24] <AzKay> Someone should play GTAIV with me.
[16:24] <Drakkar> i tend to relive stress via beat hazard more than anything else tbqh

[17:22] <CruelNoise> educate me
[17:22] <Subhazard> I think land claim flags are an excellent idea
[17:22] <Bodie> i also think this
[17:22] <CruelNoise> is permadeath a current feature, or a suggested one?
[17:22] <Shrub> Same Subhazard
[17:22] <Subhazard> It would make red stone actually viable as a security measure

[17:22] <Pelum> lol
[17:22] <Subhazard> Because you couldn't fuck with locks in a land claim area
[17:22] <Pelum> redstone ur base
[17:22] <SireTRM> We really need the ability to move single-player spawns. . .
[17:22] <SireTRM> The beach spawns aren't very good.
[17:22] <Subhazard> I think that's granted
[17:23] <Subhazard> But think about how awesome land claim flags will be, even for raiders
[17:23] <Shrub> Yeah
[17:23] <Subhazard> You'd have to wait outside by the door, waiting for the player to leave his base
[17:23] <Subhazard> then BOOM ambush him
[17:23] <SireTRM> Perma-death is an upcoming feature.
[17:23] <Bodie> wonder what cactus will be used for
[17:23] <Subhazard> take his shit
[17:23] <Bodie> surely somethign
[17:23] <Shrub> I hope Land-Claim flags themselves are stealable/Destroyable
[17:23] <CruelNoise> yeah
[17:23] <Shrub> That'll give you something to protect

[18:15] <AzKay> I was just asking a general question
[18:15] <AzKay> I dont use twitter
[18:15] <outsomnia> Wait, are we suggesting what should work as a chest+boat?
[18:15] <Bearodactyl> normally he updates at about 6:00am XD it's 7:15
[18:15] <Visiiri> I quote "Today: Fixing death bug and making leaves decay again, using a much better algorithm that I didn't have time to add yesterday."
[18:16] <AzKay> Its stupid
[18:16] <Diablodoct0r> Visiiri: No.. He does not.
[18:16] * AndrewPH is now known as AndrewPH|AFK
[18:16] <Diablodoct0r> STFU
[18:16] <Diablodoct0r> Proof does not count
[18:16] <Bearodactyl> nooo, that's when he posted it dude
[18:16] <Visiiri> You can read what he says in the twitter on the right hand side of the blog.
[18:16] <Bearodactyl> it's like
[18:16] <Bearodactyl> "POSTED TODAY:
[18:16] <Visiiri> No
[18:16] <Bearodactyl> yes.
[18:16] <Visiiri> You complete dumbass
[18:16] <AzKay> <Havnt checked the blog today
[18:16] <Visiiri> it wouldn't make a difference anyways
[18:16] <Bearodactyl> you hurt my feelings
[18:16] <Diablodoct0r> xD
[18:16] <Visiiri> if it was posted today
[18:16] <AzKay> Which is why I just asked it now, because someone mentioned an update
[18:16] <Visiiri> TODAY WOULD STILL BE TODAY.
[18:16] <AzKay> Also
[18:16] <Bearodactyl> today is tomorrow according to his post
[18:16] <Visiiri> ...lies
[18:16] <outsomnia> Sooo, when are chest/boat combinations going to be added?
[18:16] <AzKay> Just because he FIXED something today, it doesnt mean hes UPDATING today
[18:17] <Bearodactyl> no, I read
[18:17] <Bearodactyl> read it dumbass
[18:17] <Visiiri> AzKay: how could he not update
[18:17] <AzKay> He could be just fixing things on the weekend, not releasing things
[18:17] <Visiiri> and fix
[18:17] <Visiiri> lrn2knowwhat update means
[18:17] <AzKay> uuh
[18:17] <Diablodoct0r> Well
[18:17] <Diablodoct0r> He does not "update update" in weekends
[18:17] <AzKay> If hes testing it locally
[18:17] <Diablodoct0r> only fix emergences
[18:17] <AzKay> hes not updating it for the public
[18:17] <OpalMist> It's a savegame breaking bug. I imagine he'd go out of his way to update.
[18:17] <Visiiri> AzKay: He means in /game/
[18:17] <Visiiri> He's fixing the trees.
[18:17] <Visiiri> TODAY.
[18:17] <Bearodactyl> lol, oh yeah, I completely lost a farm I built
[18:17] <Visiiri> :|
[18:17] <Bearodactyl> just, it's gone
[18:17] <AzKay> Whatever you say.
[18:18] <Visiiri> Lrn2read: Today: Fixing death bug and making leaves decay again, using a much better algorithm that I didn't have time to add yesterday.
[18:18] <Diablodoct0r> Visiiri no way to talk you out of this
[18:18] <Bearodactyl> I hope he's fixing that today, I mean, I'm not getting my farm back
[18:18] <Diablodoct0r> dont even try
[18:18] <Diablodoct0r> hoe
[18:18] <AzKay> Where does he say hes updating it today?
[18:18] <Visiiri> 'out'

[18:18] <Visiiri> AzKay: WE'VE GONE OVER THIS. TWITTER>
[18:18] <Bearodactyl> he's working on it today
[18:18] <AzKay> OWAIT- He doesnt say
[18:18] <Diablodoct0r> I'm just hitting at you
[18:18] <Visiiri> Also, Bearodactyl, wrong
[18:18] <AzKay> He did not use the word update.
[18:18] <Bearodactyl> probably be implemented tomorrow or monday
[18:18] <AzKay> He used the word fix.
[18:18] <Visiiri> His post is "Today: Fixing death bug and making leaves decay again, using a much better algorithm that I didn't have time to add yesterday."
[18:18] <outsomnia> [07:17] <Visiiri> 'out'
[18:18] <outsomnia> [07:17] <Visiiri> I'm right
[18:18] <AzKay> They have two completly different meanings
[18:18] <outsomnia> Wait, what?
[18:18] <Bearodactyl> *sigh* he has to update to fix
[18:18] <Bearodactyl> update the game
[18:19] <AzKay> Not publicly update
[18:19] <Visiiri> AzKay: .g define:update
[18:19] <Bearodactyl> bringing it up to date
[18:19] <Bearodactyl> with a bug fix
[18:19] <Visiiri> Oh you little twat
[18:19] <AzKay> No
[18:19] <Visiiri> He's updating.
[18:19] <Bearodactyl> rite?
[18:19] <Diablodoct0r> "Fixing the death bug and making things work in my own game, then updating on monday"
[18:19] <Diablodoct0r> Could it mean
[18:19] <Diablodoct0r> :D
[18:19] <AzKay> Yeah, he obviously does all his testing on the live copy.
[18:19] <AzKay> Right.
[18:19] <Bearodactyl> no, updating, just the fix
[18:19] <Bearodactyl> because when you fix something
[18:19] <Bearodactyl> you have to update it
[18:19] <Visiiri> AzKay: He's not talking about multiplayer
[18:19] <Visiiri> :\
[18:19] <Bearodactyl> to implement the fix
[18:19] <outsomnia> Sooo, where is that post posted?

[18:20] <AzKay> Notch didnt say UPDATE
[18:20] <AzKay> he said FIX
[18:20] <AzKay> They are DIFFERENT
[18:20] <Visiiri> He must update the client to fix it
[18:20] <Visiiri> :/
[18:20] <AzKay> Yes
[18:20] <AzKay> HIS client
[18:20] <AzKay> his LOCAL client
[18:20] <Visiiri> No
[18:20] <Bearodactyl> diablodoct0r: bad trip rite?
[18:20] <Visiiri> Wow you fail
[18:21] <AzKay> NOT the LIVE PUBLIC client
[18:21] <Diablodoct0r> yeah
[18:21] <Demki> AzKay, update=make something up to date.
[18:21] <TrueWolves> Vis is right Az. =/
[18:21] <Visiiri> Minecraft is a Java game
[18:21] <OpalMist> Who is correct and incorrect and by how much is utterly irrelevant - He'll fix/update when he does, and no about of bitching about it is going to chage that. :p
[18:21] <Bearodactyl> the smile...
[18:21] <Visiiri> Your client will change for different trees.
[18:21] <Ominus> lol
[18:21] <Visiiri> It will NOT be the same client.

[18:35] <AzKay> is the map format hard to read?

[19:19] <So_Useless> When Notch implements dye, maybe we can get black dye from burning trees down.

[19:20] <Shrub> BUT WHERE PURP:LE/
[19:20] <So_Useless> Nah, we can get blue dye by putting cloth atop a tall tower to draw from the mighty, azure sky.
[19:21] <Foshie> Where is a good channel for DF ?
[19:21] <Shrub> We can get blue dye by absorbing a sad person
[19:21] <TotempaaltJ> Btw, AzKay: what was the reason I wouldn't get internet access again?
[19:21] <NGgod> what i dont even
[19:21] <underd0g> We'll get yellow dye from putting cloth on top of trees, and waiting for thunder to strike down on them
[19:21] <NGgod> whats the best thing to search on rule34.paheal.net?
[19:22] <So_Useless> After thunder is implemented, of course.
[19:22] <Snowman> I'll just pee on it

[19:22] <Snowman> NGgod, Notch
[19:22] <So_Useless> Search your own name.

[19:22] <AzKay> which would have something to do with some form of laws

[19:23] <Twangy> I assumed there would probably be a blue flower/mushroom, so as to have red blue and yellow dyes to mix.
[19:23] <Snowman> Wow
[19:23] <Madtoaster> Its got a nice flag :D
[19:23] <Snowman> A flag

[19:24] <Madtoaster> And a green-white thing in the middle.
[19:24] <Madtoaster> It is tall.
[19:24] <Miclee> Would've joined if the flag weren't small

[19:26] <Bodie> its sooooo cool

[19:26] <TotempaaltJ> helloworld.xxx

[19:30] <sorre> bittorrent is fantastic, if you're not retarded enough to stick with the mainstream
[19:30] <Kyttike> Im an orange
[19:30] <So_Useless> That is a comparison.

[19:31] <AzKay> Its a comparison if I say it is

[21:08] <Ominus> yeh notchbot is cool
[21:08] <Kokopure> "the game probably is quite a bit more difficult now"
[21:08] <Kokopure> oh boy
[21:08] <Kokopure> ~.~
[21:08] <TG1212> can't wait
[21:08] <Ominus> finally!
[21:08] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> hey, i think its too easy
[21:08] <Kokopure> I'm gonna hear scary mobs 24/7

[21:08] <Folis> 30000 sales :O
[21:08] <Quatroking> So, Siiseli, what do you think?
[21:08] <Kokopure> is Hard legitimately going to be "I dare you to survive" mode?
[21:08] <Quatroking> There are almost 250 people a day in this channel, wouldn't hurt to have me try out
[21:08] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> he should add an extreme mode
[21:09] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> where theres at least 10 enemies per screen :P
[21:09] <VurtualRuler98> guys I had a dream where minecraft survival's score would start off by appearing and decreasing size on your screen
[21:09] <Kokopure> dude, you'd never be able to harvest materials.
[21:09] <VurtualRuler98> and it was like 200302 or something
[21:09] <Arsonide> Tweaked monster and animal spawning a bit. The game probably is quite a bit more difficult now.
[21:09] <Kokopure> I think if he switched the times for night and day

[21:09] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> hmm maybe
[21:10] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> but he should really add seasons

[21:27] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> http://uploads.mibbit.com/IupzDf.png
[21:27] <Quatroking> Yeah, xchat has handy shortcuts for that
[21:27] <Siiseli> Quatroking, do you know WHEN to use /kick and /ban
[21:27] <AzKay> Randomnation, thats why I decided to not do that this time, olol
[21:27] <Quatroking> I'm printing the IRC rules as we speak
[21:27] <Siiseli> TADA
[21:27] <Quatroking> first a kick, then a ban
[21:28] <Siiseli> all you whiners shut the fuck up
[21:28] <Siiseli> see he knows how to be an op
[21:28] <Siiseli> don't be too strict, first a warning then a kick
[21:28] <Zode> @siiseli i agree
[21:28] <Randomnation> AzKay are arrows the only way to deal with the creepers?
[21:28] <VurtualRuler98> gasp
[21:28] <VurtualRuler98> Amazing.
[21:28] <Randomnation> Besides blocking everything but their feet
[21:28] <Quatroking> warning, kick, ban
[21:28] <Siiseli> autojoin after kick is instant tempban
[21:28] <Quatroking> got it
[21:28] <AzKay> You can get them to suicide I guess
[21:28] <AzKay> or t hat
[21:28] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> nope. Charge!
[21:28] <Quatroking> ah yeah, forgot about autojoining
[21:28] <Siiseli> and kicking without warning is my priviledge, because I'm awesome
[21:29] <VurtualRuler98> Also meanwhile another IRC network I was on died mysteriously, and I can only connect to it from my laptop.
[21:29] <Quatroking> I once drunk a whole bottle of turtle wax and it made me feel shiny inside

[21:30] <Siiseli> Quatroking, I once drank a whole bottle of vodka and it made me feel shiny inside
[21:30] <Quatroking> :D
[21:30] <VurtualRuler98> I once drank a whole 12-can box of mountain dews
[21:30] <VurtualRuler98> I didn't feel different at all
[21:30] <Siiseli> the next morning wasn't exactly as shining
[21:30] <Siiseli> in fact, the next morning I had something of a tummy ache :(
[21:30] <Siiseli> I made a boo-boo :((
[21:30] <VurtualRuler98> And the next morning I just had more mountain dew.

[21:45] <Siiseli> epaGamer, why did you start smoking would be correct english
[21:45] <E_net4> Smoking is worse than drinking alcohol.

[21:45] <Siiseli> E_net4, sure is.
[21:45] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> e_net, depends
[21:45] <Siiseli> depending on how much you drink/smoke
[21:45] <E_net4> Even alcohol is good in small proportions.
[21:45] <Kyttike> :O
[21:45] <epaGamer> sorry im learning english
[21:46] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> some people get drunk easier
[21:46] <Kyttike> so i herd you play blockland

[21:46] <visiON> I started when my friend gave me a fag
[21:46] <Kyttike> Liar :O
[21:46] <epaGamer> oh yep alcohol is good at small amounts of drinking it
[21:46] <visiON> Liked it immedieatly
[21:46] <Siiseli> then I later fell in love with the taste of cigars

[21:50] <visiON> So...

[21:50] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> "The goal was to create an inexpensive computer aimed mostly at playing CD-based multimedia titles, especially games, but also functioning as a network computer" fail
[21:50] <epaGamer> siiseli i know this and im joining army
[21:50] <Askee> nicotine still causes relaxtion though lol
[21:50] <Siiseli> anyway right so point is I know smoking and drinking is bad, but hey, you only live once and if you spend your life avoiding fun things cos' they're dangerous then you'll end up living a very boring and vain life
[21:50] <Koko|fewd> do not disappear in water more than one block deep
[21:50] <visiON> In today's society, everyone who smokes is a retard and everyone else is a healthnazi
[21:50] <E_net4> A small proportion of smoke is bad for you. A small proportion of alcohol might be good for your health.
[21:50] <VurtualRuler98> drinking isn't bad
[21:50] <sorre> >drinking
[21:50] <sorre> >fun
[21:50] <Koko|fewd> if the water is only one block deep, the problem resolves itself
[21:50] <Siiseli> epaGamer, yeah, well, in finland everyone has to go to the army for a year
[21:50] <VurtualRuler98> alchohol isn't really a problem at all for anyone who isn't absurdly weak and unhealthy
[21:50] <Randomnation> So hard mode = just more mob spawns?
[21:50] <VurtualRuler98> but smoking is bad.
[21:50] <epaGamer> but i really hate cigards
[21:50] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> redrum2k10?
[21:50] <epaGamer> in poland not ;p
[21:50] <E_net4> I also hate the smoke.
[21:51] <visiON> Haters gonna hate
[21:51] <Siiseli> E_net4, I especially enjoy the smoke
[21:51] <visiON> Lovers gonna love

[21:51] <visiON> I, myself, only like to smoke during summer
[21:51] <VurtualRuler98> so guys
[21:52] <epaGamer> Siiseli and visiON check this out http://www.smokerslungs.com/
[21:52] <visiON> because i like it
[21:52] <visiON> at summer
[21:52] <Siiseli> visiON, I usually only smoke when I'm drinking(which isn't often) or in social occasions
[21:52] <VurtualRuler98> how small could you make a computer, that could run deus ex?
[21:52] <Randomnation> alright, Sgt_C_Texturepack
[21:52] <VurtualRuler98> and games before
[21:52] <visiON> internet gore
[21:52] <Siiseli> every now and then I smoke when I'm out for a walk or something but not really that often
[21:52] <visiON> booo hooo
[21:52] <visiON> oh
[21:52] <Siiseli> look, epaGamer, I KNOW it's bad for you.
[21:52] <VurtualRuler98> I refuse to smoke, and generally mess up the arm of anyone who tries to smoke near me.
[21:52] <epaGamer> so why dont you stop smoking
[21:52] <VurtualRuler98> Then scream names in their face
[21:52] <Siiseli> a general tip, nothing you say will probably "convert" a smoker
[21:52] <Siiseli> epaGamer, I told you, I like smoking
[21:52] <visiON> How arrogant are you
[21:52] <visiON> He likes it
[21:53] <VurtualRuler98> the names of all the people I know who were killed because of this "I'LL BE FINE" ideology
[21:53] <visiON> and you keep saying WHY U DO IT
[21:53] <epaGamer> yeah but i know i was trying :P
[21:53] <Folis> I spawned like 3482534 miles away from ocean ...
[21:53] <visiON> Nobody is saying it's NOT bad for you
[21:53] <VurtualRuler98> If they don't repent, I rip their smoking arm off
[21:53] <VurtualRuler98> Literally, rip it off.
[21:53] <AzKay> Goddomnot, ive got too much coal
[21:53] <VurtualRuler98> So someone else doesn't have to end up like me, and nearly get killed because of smokers.
[21:53] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> random cant find it
[21:53] <TG1212> What right do you have to tell me what I can and can't dp
[21:53] <epaGamer> ruler98 and "everyone will die anyway"
[21:53] <VurtualRuler98> and have all their dreams shattered, because they would develop athsma
[21:53] <visiON> Is a free country

[21:54] <Sgt_C_Texturepack> "
[21:54] <Siiseli> but I'm not going around converting people to atheism
[21:54] <VurtualRuler98> you guys think it's fine to smoke you're not hurting anyone
[21:54] <Siiseli> or whining about how stupid they are
[21:54] <epaGamer> IM ATHEIS
[21:54] <Siiseli> I'm also a vegetarian,
[21:54] <epaGamer> ATHEIST
[21:54] <VurtualRuler98> but I was almost a weak, bedridden person because people smoked all the time

[21:54] <Siiseli> and nobody wants to hear me whine about their habits
[21:54] <VurtualRuler98> even to this day I handle poorly around cigarette smoke
[21:54] <Siiseli> they're not gonna change it

[22:13] <Koko|fewd> they feel to me like the same futurama I always watched
[22:13] <AzKay> Also, dont see why I said reasoned
[22:13] <AzKay> Meant to say, realised
[22:13] <Koko|fewd> they don't really feel new to me
[22:14] <epaGamer> there was episode where leela was playing Peggy

[22:14] <AzKay> wait
[22:14] <AzKay> wat
[22:14] <epaGamer> yep
[22:14] <VurtualRuler98> no but it feels.. different.
[22:14] <Chocolatey_Syrup> yeah I always thought that episode was stupid
[22:14] <VurtualRuler98> the way the whole thing is set up just seems... off

[22:32] <DEElekgolo> There was a thread last night about hypothetically making your own vidya review site. A few of us decided that the ideal site would be one focused on informative reviews without overpowering opinions like IGN and Gamespot. The whole idea is that we'd be real gamers and not hack journalists in the pockets of the industry. Being a designer, web host, and writer, I had the ability to do this, so I jumped on it like a
[22:32] <DEElekgolo> whore on crack.

[23:46] <Demki> also, note that golden apple is made from 8 blocks of gold and a red apple
[23:46] <VurtualRuler98> so you have to cheat and make fire into a placable block

[23:46] <Demki> not exactly a healthy diat
[23:46] <Demki> diet*
[23:46] <VurtualRuler98> then, you can craft that as if it were a unique metal
