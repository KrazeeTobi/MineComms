[0:00] <Visiiri> RGB, I suspect, due to the texture file.
[0:00] <Visiiri> asdf I gotta fly
[0:00] <Visiiri> new CSI is on
[0:00] <layla> ive always had diff types, just never used them :P

[0:00] <Chocolatey_Syrup> ...I just realized Notch is still in here
[0:00] * Visiiri is now known as Vis{CRYMESCENE}
[0:00] <Chocolatey_Syrup> But he hasn't said anything for a long time.
[0:00] <Kodaichi> yeah. not exactly responding
[0:00] <Chocolatey_Syrup> That means he's still working today :o
[0:00] <Kodaichi> He is in trance mode right now
[0:01] <Darkebrz> Vis{CRYMESCENE}, any songs you suggest?
[0:01] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I wonder if we'll get another update today. Not, like, necessarily a playable update to infdev or anything, but at least another neat blog post like yesterday's.
[0:01] <Darkebrz> aw D:
[0:01] <outsomnia> Or maybe he just acquired 3d Dot Heroes. :)

[0:04] <nalp777> ;)
[0:04] <layla> indev crashes for me :(
[0:04] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I think the best thing is to just let him get carried away with whatever he wants to get carried away with. It's obvious some of the spark is back.

[0:08] <Darkebrz> Hm. In hundreds of years when we finally manage to get humans to mars, the place is going to be littered with rovers

[0:11] <Conde> Lol, i see Notch is here
[0:11] <Chocolatey_Syrup> So yeah, I really hope we get a bit more news today, whether or not infdev itself is updated.
[0:11] <Chocolatey_Syrup> he hasn't spoken in hours
[0:11] * Griskard (chatzilla@213.117.dsl.syd.iprimus.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[0:11] <Knuk[Away]> yay notch is here
[0:11] * Knuk[Away] is now known as Knuk
[0:11] * Knuk is no longer away : Gone for 9 hours 50 minutes 41 seconds
[0:11] <Conde> He's probably working or something
[0:12] <Conde> Or eating cake
[0:12] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Incidentally it's always nice to see Notch get carried away with his work, it shows how much he enjoys it :V
[0:12] <Knuk> that means he could release signs today :D
[0:12] <Chocolatey_Syrup> possibly
[0:12] <Knuk> :D
[0:12] <shairn> that would be cool
[0:12] <shairn> kinda pointless for single player games but still cool :D
[0:12] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I mean, we leave him alone and let him work on what he wants to add, and he gets back in the groove for feasible details that don't require rewriting gigantic chunks of code to make
[0:12] <Conde> today 23:59 PM GMT
[0:13] <Chocolatey_Syrup> and suddenly in the course of two days he's talking about doors and signs
[0:13] <Knuk> he talked about doors?
[0:13] <shairn> doors now that's useful
[0:13] <Conde> When did he talk about door?
[0:13] <Conde> doors*
[0:13] <gear1> over twitter
[0:13] <Conde> *runs to check his twitter*
[0:13] <gear1> www.twitter.com/xnotch
[0:13] <Knuk> "My Pandora just shipped. Omg. Also, I think I'm adding doors."
[0:13] <Knuk> :O :D
[0:14] <shairn> no more need for barricading yourself in your base
[0:14] <nalp777> niiice :D
[0:14] <shairn> yaaaay
[0:14] <Knuk> I hope creepers dunno how to pass a door
[0:14] <Conde> So, no more 1x2 space with dirt block in the upper side of it
[0:14] <Knuk> lol

[0:18] <vede> Also, I've been told that one of the core elements of any good game is the ability to set people on fire with monsters. Notch, you're half way there! Shouldn't be too hard to go the rest, should it?
[0:18] <Cyrex> Is there a download for the infdev yet?

[0:20] <vede> That's the planned time for a standalone release.
[0:20] * Chris220 is now known as Chris|AFK
[0:21] <SpaceManiac> Chocolatey_Syrup: I like how it tries again after it realizes there's dirt there
[0:21] <shairn> it's very advanced pathfing AI
[0:21] <shairn> *bump bump bump*
[0:21] <nalp> hehe ;D
[0:21] <SpaceManiac> That'd be awesome if creepers did that

[0:24] <Cyrex> D: apparently water still isn't fixed on inf
[0:25] <nalp777> he hasnt updated has he?
[0:25] <GoaLitiuM> no updates in one month
[0:25] <Marach> woah, behold the most pointless and retarded lulz ever seen. http://eecomics.net/?strip_id=1
[0:25] <Marach> can't stop pressing "next"
[0:26] <TW|Gone> MUAHAHAHAHA
[0:26] * TW|Gone is now known as TrueWolves
[0:26] <TrueWolves> I AM, IN HIGHSCHOOL, NO MORE
[0:26] <GoaLitiuM> kinda shitty comic
[0:27] <Snowman> Ok
[0:27] <Snowman> I'm gonna do the Nuzlocke challenge with HeartGold
[0:28] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Marach I agree with what you said except for the implication that the linked comic is in any way funny or amusing
[0:28] <Chocolatey_Syrup> the pointless and retarded point is dead on though
[0:28] <nalp777> you guys think he will update tomorrow?
[0:28] <Marach> i mean the entire webcomic
[0:28] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I sure hope so
[0:28] <nalp777> that would be sweet :D
[0:28] <Marach> give it a try
[0:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I did, it's so bad it's painful to read
[0:29] <GoaLitiuM> over 1000 strips...
[0:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> the generic anime-ish artstyle doesn't help either
[0:29] <Marach> that's the point
[0:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> well, I gave it a try, and it sucked
[0:29] <Marach> and nice shading goes away early
[0:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Incidentally, I don't feel like I can go back to infdev until trees can clear out on their own.
[0:29] <GoaLitiuM> well im going to judge that comic by reading the first 3 strips and calling that shitty
[0:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Having to destroy every single leaf block manually is just... not very fun.
[0:29] * Knuk (Waffles@bas1-quebec14-1128686801.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
[0:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Every time I want to harvest wood, I have to clear out an entire tree.
[0:30] <Knuk> same
[0:30] <Marach> ew, it's like judging a game basing on opening cutscene
[0:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I can't just leave those floating trees
[0:30] <Marach> it gets worse in a good sense
[0:30] <Knuk> burn them
[0:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> until that's fixed I don't think I'll go back to infdev
[0:30] <GoaLitiuM> Marach: it's not my fault that the opening doesn't match the game
[0:31] <nalp777> i agree with chocolatey_syrup
[0:31] <Marach> brb, evil chickens of doom
[0:31] <nalp777> it pretty annoying
[0:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> this comic still sucks
[0:31] <Marach> oh wait
[0:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> it's like the kind of humor thirteen year olds who watch invaded zim like
[0:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> LOL SO RANDOM
[0:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> MONKEY CHEESE
[0:31] <Marach> i better play twillight princess
[0:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> HAHAHA
[0:32] <Marach> well, there are evil chickens of doom too there
[0:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> SAYING RANDOM STUPID THINGS IS FUNNY
[0:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> yeah, see?
[0:32] <nalp777> and mining in infdev with no caves are also boring
[0:32] * rcfighter (rcfighter@c-69-138-73-173.hsd1.md.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> You're proving my point
[0:32] <Marach> see, they're everywhere.
[0:32] <Marach> just turn around
[0:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> "____ of doom" is the epitome of asinine "lolrandom" comedy
[0:32] * Marach is now known as Marafk
[0:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Here, in case anyone else was unfortunate enough to follow his link
[0:33] <Chocolatey_Syrup> let me sum up the whole comic (save its wannabe-anime artsyle) in a single image for you
[0:33] <Chocolatey_Syrup> http://img210.imageshack.us/img210/4385/randomm.png

[0:36] <nalp777> like "im leaving" and then: "okay"!
[0:36] <Cyrex> what's a good way to make it so you can easily see where you are on the cartographer map thing?
[0:37] <Chocolatey_Syrup> at this rate he might actually get more than one update out this week

[1:14] <Fordlover89> I'm trying to find out my exact graphics card number
[1:14] <Perry> Haaah
[1:14] <Fordlover89> i mean model
[1:14] <Fordlover89> my bad
[1:14] <Perry> you seemed idle
[1:15] <blaster> Fatal errors are not realy fatal, after all, your not dead are you?
[1:15] <shairn> use the auto detect feature on the nvidia website
[1:15] <Snowman> I seemed indeed
[1:15] <Fordlover89> i could be dead
[1:15] <Laplace> @Blaster, they're fatal to his minecrafting experience.
[1:15] <Fordlover89> mmhm
[1:15] <Fordlover89> it's hot in hell
[1:15] <Fordlover89> :D
[1:15] <Laplace> Which is indirectly involved with his physical health.
[1:15] <Perry> -.-
[1:15] <GoaLitiuM> blaster: his graphics card should be dead in case of fatal errors (just kidding)
[1:15] <Azathoth> it's probably 42, fordlover89
[1:15] <blaster> My graphics card once died, looked like my computer was on LSD
[1:15] <Kodaichi> I don't think Fordlover89 is a bot. I can tell by some of the comments and from seeing quite a few bots in my time.
[1:15] <Fordlover89> holy jesus why is my computer beeping so much i think it's about to ex....
[1:16] <Azathoth> lol
[1:16] <Fordlover89> I'm not a bot
[1:16] <Fordlover89> :P
[1:16] <GoaLitiuM> that's what all bots say
[1:16] <Fordlover89> mmhm
[1:16] <Azathoth> i like how you took the time to type ... rather than finish explode as your computer was exploding
[1:16] <Laplace> Also, Esper never ceases to annoy me, first (okay I forgot what the first was), then the scarce amount of channel modes, and now no nick grouping?
[1:16] <Perry> what if non-bots said "I'm a bot"
[1:16] <Fordlover89> I found the driver
[1:16] <shairn> I don,t think kodaichi has seen quite a few bots in his time. I can tell from his comments and from being quite a few bots in my time.
[1:17] <Fordlover89> Beep motherfucka i'm a gangsta bot
[1:17] * Kodaichi whimpers sadly
[1:17] <Azathoth> shairn has been quite a few bots?
[1:17] <Laplace> I put forward the motion that we kick Nickserv, all in favor say any word containing a vowel.
[1:17] <shairn> naw
[1:17] <blaster> That is what a bot sounded like
[1:17] <Kodaichi> NVR.
[1:17] <Azathoth> NP
[1:18] <Laplace> B|
[1:18] <Idlemator> I forward the notion that you should shut up, Laplace. All in favor, say Aye.
[1:18] <Snowman> ARR!
[1:18] <blaster> Y

[1:22] <outsomnia> [14:19] <Azathoth> i want to build something before you get that fixxed
[1:22] <Kodaichi> so guys, I think we should ask Notch tomorrow to implement fish.
[1:22] <Blaster> I used irony for the lulz
[1:22] <Kodaichi> Then, we will ask him how i mine fish
[1:22] <Perry> WHoa! fish
[1:22] <Blaster> Kodaichi, nukes any day
[1:22] <Perry> I think fish is a good idea
[1:22] <outsomnia> Yes, fish would be aweosme, and a good reason to delve into deep waters other than oooh priti ocean floor
[1:22] <Blaster> Or more crops, the farming thing seems to bland right now
[1:22] <Fordlover89> Updating my drivers
[1:22] <Perry> yep blaster
[1:22] <Fordlover89> i'll brb if my computer doesn't self destruct
[1:22] <shairn> ore should spawn a lot more underwater
[1:22] <outsomnia> Or rather, let me have my giant sea serpents and KRAKKKEENNN already.
[1:22] <Blaster> *too
[1:22] <shairn> it would make it useful
[1:22] <Perry> making bread is a tedious business
[1:23] <Blaster> Or even better, BIOMES
[1:23] <Perry> ...
[1:23] <outsomnia> I'd pay to have biomes.
[1:23] <Kodaichi> I think it would be funny if everyone pulled a prank on Notch and pretended that we couldn't figure something out
[1:23] <Kodaichi> no matter how hard he tried to explain it
[1:23] <Blaster> How to craft sign
[1:23] <Blaster> We keep spamming him with that
[1:23] <Perry> Is sign out already?

[1:23] <outsomnia> Don't we do already?
[1:23] <Blaster> No

[1:24] <Fordlover89> 's virginity is lost
[1:24] <darkedone02> signs could be useful... for designation and fortress/city designing.

[1:54] <shairn> sounds to me like your problem is
[1:54] <shairn> whatever it is
[1:54] <Visiiri> Now, when I start the game, it works fine.
[1:55] <Visiiri> I click New Game (As would be presumed.) and the window pops up with a Yes or No option.

[2:40] <Visiiri> Fuck those games
[2:40] <Snowman> Oh
[2:40] <Perry> nevermind
[2:41] <Visiiri> get TimeShift
[2:41] <Snowman> Opfor is longer and has extra weapons
[2:41] <Perry> between oposing force and TFC
[2:41] <Snowman> But Blueshift has Barney, so it's eppic
[2:41] <Perry> because I have them all and I'm trying to decide wich one to download first :3
[2:41] <Snowman> TFC is multiplayer only, OpFor is singleplayer all
[2:41] <Snowman> Download?
[2:41] <Snowman> YARR?
[2:41] <Perry> Steam
[2:41] <Snowman> Or steam download
[2:41] <Perry> legal download
[2:41] <Snowman> Oh, ok
[2:41] <Perry> I got them with the HL1 anthology

[2:44] <AndrewPH> snowman, yes it is rhuruurhurhr

[2:44] <Visiiri> Yes, and?
[2:44] <AndrewPH> Perry, It is for at least all drugs
[2:44] <Visiiri> Because it's a sickness it HAS to be virus
[2:44] <AndrewPH> Visiiri, rabies = science
[2:44] <Visiiri> err

[2:45] <Perry> :D

[2:45] <Perry> so wich one to I download first
[2:45] <Cial> i thought sooo
[2:45] <AndrewPH> Why do drugs have a half life then
[2:45] <Perry> opposing force or tfc?
[2:45] <Visiiri> OF
[2:45] <Snowman> Uranium doesn't necessarily turn into plutonium when decaying
[2:45] <Perry> *googles*
[2:46] <Perry> :D
[2:46] <Visiiri> During the decaying process it does loose protons.
[2:46] <Perry> google = everything
[2:46] <Snowman> It has multiple decay options IIRC
[2:46] <Perry> google is the gate to rule 34
[2:46] <Snowman> Depends on the Uranium isotope as well though

[3:18] <EmpiresBane> it's just not referenced anymore
[3:18] <CrazySpai> Exactly.
[3:18] <Snowman> I use a 50T magnet

[3:23] <Snowman> Why not allow people to have lust?
[3:23] <CrazySpai> Catholics are anal about most eveything. I was raised catholic but ever since I discovered the Bing Bang theory I started to question religion.

[3:23] <shairn> according to the bible it's god's punishment
[3:23] <Snowman> EmpiresBane, so what? Loads of scientists were religious
[3:23] <AndrewPH> CrazySpai, I was raised religeous but I don't remember actually believing any of it
[3:23] <shairn> along with all bad things
[3:23] <CrazySpai> EmpiresBane: So? He was also very close to being ex-communicated.
[3:23] <Snowman> Loads of the were atheists as well
[3:24] <AndrewPH> shairn, wait, something awesome is a punishment?
[3:24] <outsomnia> So you decide before you make something, that you're going to punish it as soon as you make it?
[3:24] <EmpiresBane> are you guys saying newton was a retard?
[3:24] <shairn> no wait
[3:24] <Snowman> Fapping doesn't sound as much of a punishment to me
[3:24] <shairn> right
[3:24] <CrazySpai> AndrewPH: I can't say i did either. It was just forced to attend church when I'd laugh at all the things the pastor was saying.
[3:24] <shairn> lust is the devil's work
[3:24] <shairn> what am I saying

[3:27] <outsomnia> We all know everyone's going to put signs saying [Dicks] everywhere, but what about doors?
[3:27] <EmpiresBane> the biggest problem with religous debates is that botch sides have false veiws of the other
[3:27] <CrazySpai> thechris: It's because Apple sucks
[3:27] <AndrewPH> outsomnia, doors will open new exploratory choices
[3:27] <Cial> can we lay them horizontal outsomnia ?

[3:27] <DimJim> i will use signs as direction things
[3:28] <AndrewPH> OH GOD GUYS STOP TALKING ABOUT RELIGION
[3:28] <Idlemator> Shairn has the point. There's a reason why I added in, "Agree to Disagree" in the rules.

[3:30] <Cial> i would do that or make it lead to a pit of creepers and stuff
[3:30] <shairn> and that's all for the year
[3:30] <thechris> the hardest written test i ever took was in gym
[3:30] <outsomnia> Oh those days
[3:30] <thechris> SUCK IT IE
[3:30] <CrazySpai> I rememby my gym test
[3:30] <CrazySpai> "What is your shoe size?"
[3:30] <Idlemator> My L.A. teacher is taking this relaxed though, and my Leadership Class along with my Computer Class are just adding in the last project we did as the final.
[3:30] <CrazySpai> End of exam
[3:30] <shairn> since there's a reform in schools in quebec pretty much every class has no finals
[3:31] <shairn> pretty neat
[3:31] <thechris> luck
[3:31] <Idlemator> So that's 3 out of 8 tests that I don't have to worry about, and I did Math today.
[3:31] <thechris> lucky
[3:31] <shairn> but they give us work that's supposed to be for a year later
[3:31] <shairn> they,re trying to make us pass more easily
[3:31] <Snowman> Calculus as well?
[3:31] <shairn> since we'll be lacking employees for jobs in -10 years
[3:31] <eZek0> I'm so glad I skipped the reform, shairn. god.
[3:31] <shairn> 5-10*
[3:32] <shairn> it's not so bad IMO

[3:39] <shairn> your monitor?
[3:39] <Snowman> I know a few things about colour
[3:40] <blaster> The problem is not the moniter or loose cables
[3:40] <blaster> But my computer has randomly decided to set blue down to minimun
[3:40] <Snowman> Did you try smacking the monitor?
[3:40] <Quatroking> blaster: your GPu is not giving through the blue channel.
[3:40] <revenant> New Wikipedia: Discuss.
[3:40] <shairn> when it happened to me I just pushed the cables in but okay
[3:40] <blaster> Quatroking, is there a fix for that?
[3:40] <Quatroking> Which model is your card?
[3:40] <blaster> 6600
[3:40] <blaster> I suspected that
[3:40] <Quatroking> thats Nvidia right
[3:40] <revenant> if its all yellow the blue and magenta channels probly arent going through
[3:40] <blaster> This is the second dead graphics card this year
[3:40] <blaster> yes
[3:40] <revenant> if it was just blue itd be red.
[3:41] <Quatroking> Check it on an other pc
[3:41] <blaster> There is a little bit of blue and magenta
[3:41] <Quatroking> revenant: if the blue channel dies, the yellow and red keep alive
[3:41] <blaster> Quatroking what if I do not have another PC
[3:41] <Quatroking> uh
[3:41] <Quatroking> green and red
[3:41] <Quatroking> blaster: wellllll
[3:41] <blaster> About 1% blue is displaying
[3:41] <Snowman> Take out the card and put it back in
[3:41] <revenant> ah, I'm thinking in CMYK XD
[3:41] <revenant> oopsy daisy.
[3:41] <blaster> I do not have the means to do that right now snowman
[3:42] <Quatroking> blaster, do you have onboard graphics as well?
[3:42] <blaster> I am looking for a control panel related fix
[3:42] <Cial> any one know how to use NBTedit?
[3:42] <shairn> I do
[3:42] <blaster> Quatroking, I am not sure but I suspect no
[3:42] <Quatroking> I ment a vga/dvi port on your motherboard
[3:42] <Quatroking> meant*
[3:42] <blaster> No, the vga port is on my GPU
[3:43] <blaster> So is there anything on the control panel that can fix this
[3:44] <Quatroking> did you try other monitors?
[3:44] <blaster> Quatoking I have no other moniters
[3:44] <blaster> I have no other hardware avalible
[3:44] <EmpiresBane> have you tried jiggling the caple?
[3:44] <blaster> Yes
[3:44] <Quatroking> so you only have one computer in the entire fucking house
[3:44] <blaster> but thats what she said
[3:44] <shairn> pushing it in? :P
[3:44] <Quatroking> jesus
[3:44] <blaster> Welcome to england quatroking
[3:44] <blaster> Sharin yes
[3:44] <Quatroking> family pc eh
[3:44] <blaster> It is not the cable
[3:44] <Quatroking> lemme put it like this, the average dutch family has three pc's.
[3:44] <Snowman> Try smacking the monitor
[3:44] <EmpiresBane> have you checked your eyes?
[3:45] <blaster> Smacked monitor, nothing
[3:45] <Snowman> Try smacking your little brother
[3:45] <Quatroking> what kind of monitor?
[3:45] <Quatroking> LCD?
[3:45] <Snowman> LSD
[3:45] <blaster> Uhhh....
[3:45] <blaster> I have no idea
[3:45] <blaster> 2001
[3:45] <Quatroking> flat or fat
[3:45] <EmpiresBane> is it huge or thin?
[3:45] <blaster> Flat
[3:45] <Snowman> Touche the screen
[3:45] <Quatroking> Then its probably your monitor.
[3:46] <Snowman> How does it feel
[3:46] <EmpiresBane> smacking it isn't going to help...
[3:46] <blaster> It makes loads of waves
[3:46] <Snowman> Hmmm...
[3:46] <blaster> like ripples in water
[3:46] <EmpiresBane> that LCD
[3:46] <blaster> It is not the moniter but I think it is the output from the pc
[3:46] <Quatroking> blaster, see if you can pick up a cheap monitor somewhere, second-hand
[3:46] <Quatroking> how come you think that
[3:46] <blaster> But not specificly the GPU
[3:47] <blaster> The moniter works fine
[3:47] <Quatroking> as far as I know, LCD's are very vulnarable to color shit

[3:47] <blaster> To set the blue to over 9000
[3:47] <Quatroking> blaster
[3:47] <Quatroking> goddamnit
[3:48] <Quatroking> if your lcd can't display blue it can't display blue
[3:48] <blaster> It can
[3:48] <blaster> Just very little of it

[3:49] <shairn> why kodaichi
[3:49] <Jat> lol trolling?
[3:49] <shairn> whyyy
[3:49] <Quatroking> Now that I think of it, I used to have a monitor in which the green channel died while I was USING it.
[3:49] <Kodaichi> nobody is talking about anything weird yet :/
[3:49] <Kodaichi> BECAUSE it is a large channel.
[3:49] <Quatroking> boom, purple shit

[6:49] <Vicrry> Hopefully indev->infdev conversion will happen not too long after multiplayer
[6:49] <Rikuchi> im curious....
[6:49] <Rikuchi> notch said he would put out another update on his work tommorow on
[6:49] * Codwork is now known as Codlike
[6:49] <Rikuchi> on his june 1st blog
[6:50] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[6:50] <Rikuchi> well, tommorow is now today in this cae
[6:50] <Rikuchi> case*
[6:50] <Rikuchi> and I have yet to see a update.
[6:50] <Vicrry> ...
[6:50] <LuciferZ> Rikuchi, have you been around long?
[6:50] <Rikuchi> on minecraft? yes
[6:50] <AndrewPH> Rikuchi, He works on 'Notch time'
[6:51] <Rikuchi> on chatrooms? no
[6:51] <PuyoDead> Err, how long?
[6:51] <AndrewPH> AKA valve time but faster
[6:51] <Cial> time is irrelevant to game devs
[6:51] <Vicrry> 'today' means anytime before midnight tonight. Assuming he hasn't broken it and needs to fixit more
[6:51] <LuciferZ> So you don't know that "tomorrow" means "In a few days"
[6:51] <LuciferZ> And "In a few months" means "next week"?
[6:51] <Rikuchi> yes, but he did say after june1st he would work "full" time on minecraft
[6:51] <Cial> soon is between today and the week after the rapture
[6:51] <Cial> doesnt mean he will blog about it
[6:52] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.67.81) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[6:52] <Rikuchi> if notch did not mean what he said then why bother speaking empty words?
[6:52] <TrueWolves> ...
[6:52] <TrueWolves> what?
[6:52] <AndrewPH> Rikuchi, because you're being dumb about it
[6:52] <TrueWolves> Are you even reading what people are saying?
[6:52] <AndrewPH> <Cial> time is irrelevant to game devs
[6:52] <AndrewPH> in the words of cial
[6:52] <AndrewPH> time is irrelevant to game devs
[6:52] <Cial> ^_^ every now and then i come off with something good
[6:53] <Rikuchi> sigh* People continue to disappoint me
[6:53] <PuyoDead> When did he say "tomorrow", anyway?
[6:53] <Rikuchi> if you do not mean what you say
[6:53] <TrueWolves> Again Riku
[6:53] <Rikuchi> then why speak at all?
[6:53] <TrueWolves> Are you even reading what people are typing?
[6:53] <PuyoDead> Evidently not.
[6:53] <Cial> Rikuchi, busy man cant be bothered by us mere mortals
[6:53] <Rikuchi> I'm talking about people in general
[6:54] <PuyoDead> I still see no mention of "tomorrow".
[6:54] <Vicrry> Step 1: Make a good game. Step 2: Worry about release dates. Alternatively, you could do EA method of Step 1: Make some shitty pile that'll make the release date. Step 2: Delay anyway.
[6:54] <AndrewPH> Rikuchi, are you dumb still after months of ruthless christian concentration camp torture?
[6:54] <Rikuchi> yes, yes I am.
[6:54] <Cial> Rikuchi, to quote House "Everybody lies"
[6:54] <Rikuchi> you can't beat the dumb out of me.
[6:54] <AndrewPH> To quote cial

[6:55] <PuyoDead> Ohhh, you must think "* Craft a sign item (will be finished tomorrow)" means, "I'll update tomorrow".
[6:55] <Rikuchi> No,
[6:55] <PuyoDead> Sometimes he'll go a few days in a row of multiple updates. Sometimes a week of nothing.
[6:55] <Rikuchi> After re-reading the page
[6:55] <TrueWolves> A lot of the time he'll do work and not update the blog
[6:56] <Rikuchi> I feel I somehow must have misread it
[6:56] <TrueWolves> Just becuase /you/ don't see the work yet doesn't mean it wasn't done.
[6:56] <Rikuchi> I could have sworn it said I'll post a update by tommorow
[6:56] <Cial> Rikuchi, to quote some Chinese philosopher "All good things come to those who wait"
[6:56] <PuyoDead> Well, either way, he proably will update. Now that he's back at it, I think it's safe to say he'll be pretty constant.
[6:57] <Rikuchi> I certainly hope so.
[6:57] <TrueWolves> Confucious: "The desire to have things done quickly prevents their being done thoroughly."
[6:57] <PuyoDead> When he gets into it, he'll update the blog and game multiple times a week.
[6:58] <Rikuchi> and Andrew I only went to the camp once

[7:04] <TrueWolves> oh /wow/

[7:04] <PuyoDead> Jun. 14, 2009 21:13:12 PDT for me.
[7:04] <TrueWolves> Rikuchi was around here back in october?
[7:04] <TrueWolves> o.O
[7:04] <TrueWolves> /late/ october, but still.
[7:04] <Rikuchi> that was when I filled out the job application for the artist position
[7:05] <PuyoDead> Oh, holy hell. I didn't even think about that, I'm about to hit my 1 year with my premium account.
[7:05] <Azathoth> um
[7:05] <Azathoth> seriously
[7:05] <Vicrry> I'll sometimes see something as something else when really frakking drunk :P

[7:05] <TrueWolves> Your drinking the wrong stuff then Vicrry, just becuase mouthwash has alchohol doesn't mean you should get drunk off it.
[7:05] <Rikuchi> I dont even think i have a minecraft forum account as of yet
[7:06] <Azathoth> vicrry must drink absynthe or something
[7:06] <outsomnia> Neither do I
[7:06] <Rikuchi> bah, ill get to it eventually
[7:06] <Visiiri> What's a good ipod IRC app?
[7:06] <Rikuchi> i used a html based irc
[7:06] <Vicrry> I suspect it has something more to do with alcohol and memory than anything else :P
[7:06] <Rikuchi> that works on phones that dont support flash or java
[7:06] <PuyoDead> Yea, alcohol isn't a hallucinogen. At all.
[7:06] <Rikuchi> isn't alcohol a depressant?
[7:07] <PuyoDead> Well, aside from making ugly girls attractive.
[7:07] <Budda> it doesnt depress me
[7:07] <outsomnia> Eating unmixed red shrooms should do that.
[7:07] <PuyoDead> And yes, it's a depressant.
[7:07] <Azathoth> alcohol turns me into a genuine retard :(
[7:08] <Vicrry> ^^ This
[7:08] <LuciferZ> Alcohol makes me sleepy
[7:08] <PuyoDead> I just talk a lot then regret it the next day.
[7:08] <Azathoth> which is why i don't do parties and things
[7:08] <LuciferZ> I am a sleepy drunk
[7:08] <Azathoth> i'd make a complete ass out of myself
[7:08] <Rikuchi> darn
[7:08] <Budda> currently hashing 2TiB of files for a LAN on the weekend....its taking ages
[7:08] <Azathoth> and i'd almost certainly lose my keys
[7:09] <Azathoth> since i have this tendancy to intentionally misplace my keys when i'm drunk so that i don't try to drive
[7:09] <Rikuchi> well I'm pretty sure i joined minecraft around july to august 2009
[7:09] <Rikuchi> that is the best estimation I can make
[7:09] <Azathoth> problem is it's usually in really weird places and i don't remember where
[7:09] <TrueWolves> Whelp.
[7:09] <TrueWolves> huh...

[7:11] <TW|Gone> He got chased out or something
[7:11] <TW|Gone> or at least someone got em to quit
[7:11] <Rikuchi> wait puyo that sounds a bit backwards
[7:11] <Rikuchi> he Fixed his keyboard
[7:11] <PuyoDead> Or took the boxing gloves off, and is in rehab for typing.

[8:45] <VurtualRuler98> I'll just dig inward-pointing fortifications then.

[8:55] <Speljohan_> thou shalt follow these
[8:55] <vede> The rules are really just there to make the ops feel more secure when they get rid of disruptors.
[8:56] <clone|1018> ohai vede
[8:56] <Speljohan_> lol
[8:56] <vede> And give disruptors less room to shout about op abuse.
[8:56] <clone|1018> What happened to your op?
[8:56] <Speljohan_> aboooose
[8:56] <clone|1018> nvm
[8:56] <VurtualRuler98> the rules are the op's little happy blanket of magical deflect idiocy.

[8:58] <vede> I can see a rule-less channel working relatively civilized (assuming there's a constant, unwritten "don't be a dick and don't be retarded" rule).

[8:58] <vede> But not this channel.
[8:58] <VurtualRuler98> it was lame

[9:02] <clone|1018> it barley works
[9:02] <Speljohan_> i don't see how programming is a path to redemption
[9:02] <AndrewPH> ok so you don't have anything to redeem yourself with
[9:02] <vede> Then shove off.
[9:02] <VurtualRuler98> oh hey just throw it into the brew
[9:02] <VurtualRuler98> we need more barley
[9:02] <clone|1018> Make me
[9:02] <Speljohan_> i'd say a formal apology for whatever you have done counts more
[9:02] <vede> Very well.
[9:02] <clone|1018> I havent done anything
[9:02] * VurtualRuler98 calls the banmobile
[9:02] <Speljohan_> oh ok
[9:02] <VurtualRuler98> KLINES TO SPEED.
[9:02] <Speljohan_> victim of the system
[9:02] <Speljohan_> just like my previous ban :D
[9:02] <AndrewPH> clone|1018, Formal apology would work better, however you've insulted half of the ops already and you have insulted and threatened to sue tktech and I, so your credibility went down the drain like a shit.
[9:03] <outsomnia> [22:02] <Speljohan_> just like my previous ban :D
[9:03] <VurtualRuler98> you poop in the toilet, you know
[9:03] <outsomnia> wat
[9:03] <clone|1018> I have a perfectly good reason to try to sue you
[9:03] <AndrewPH> You don't
[9:03] <AndrewPH> It's notch's
[9:03] <clone|1018> You stole work
[9:03] <AndrewPH> not yours
[9:03] <clone|1018> That you didnt own
[9:03] <clone|1018> SkinPreview.jar is mine
[9:03] <AndrewPH> no it's not
[9:03] <clone|1018> Not the other jar
[9:03] <AndrewPH> it's notch's
[9:03] <clone|1018> yes
[9:03] <clone|1018> it is
[9:03] <clone|1018> No
[9:03] <Speljohan_> <outsomnia> wat
[9:03] <AndrewPH> keyia made skinpreview.jar
[9:03] <AndrewPH> she said anybody can use it
[9:03] <clone|1018> No
[9:03] <vede> clone|1018, shut the hell up and tell us what this thing you think will "redeem" you will be.
[9:03] <AndrewPH> get your head out of your ass
[9:03] <clone|1018> She doesnt have that right
[9:03] <VurtualRuler98> and they did not give you "full rights" to it
[9:03] <Speljohan_> i was singled out and banned despite people in chan making more "offensive" remarks outsomnia
[9:03] <AndrewPH> she does
[9:04] <Speljohan_> :P
[9:04] <AndrewPH> she made it
[9:04] <vede> brb
[9:04] <VurtualRuler98> Want me to just shoot you, clone|1018?
[9:04] <clone|1018> It was made when she was part of the time
[9:04] <AndrewPH> she made it
[9:04] <clone|1018> It was legally given to us
[9:04] <AndrewPH> she made it
[9:04] <outsomnia> Oh, the usual huh?
[9:04] <Speljohan_> yep!
[9:04] <AndrewPH> she made it
[9:04] <VurtualRuler98> I like shooting people, it used to be my job.
[9:04] <furrot> is the the minecraft chat?
[9:04] <Speljohan_> i'm used to it though, it's irc
[9:04] <clone|1018> It is Minecrafter's work
[9:04] <AndrewPH> she made it
[9:04] <outsomnia> @ furrot yes unfortunately
[9:04] <AndrewPH> no you
[9:04] <AndrewPH> it's not you
[9:04] <AndrewPH> it's not yours rather
[9:04] <clone|1018> Just because you paint a car doesnt mean its yours
[9:04] <AndrewPH> damn enter key
[9:04] <AndrewPH> exactly clone
[9:04] <AndrewPH> stop using her work and claiming it as your own
[9:05] <clone|1018> So if she made it for us. While working UNDER us. its OURs
[9:05] <VurtualRuler98> no, it is not
[9:05] <AndrewPH> she made it for the general public
[9:05] <VurtualRuler98> because screw you
[9:05] <furrot> hehe, thanks outsomnia, I thought maybe i was in the wrong channel...
[9:05] <clone|1018> No
[9:05] <clone|1018> She didnt
[9:05] <AndrewPH> yes
[9:05] <AndrewPH> yes she did
[9:05] <AndrewPH> I discussed it with her
[9:05] <clone|1018> She was personally asked into the team
[9:05] <VurtualRuler98> sue me then
[9:05] <clone|1018> to do that for us
[9:05] <VurtualRuler98> sue me, clone|1018.
[9:05] <AndrewPH> clone do you have more downs than usual?
[9:05] <VurtualRuler98> I have it used many times on my own site.
[9:05] <AndrewPH> Just sue the whole channel for even looking at it
[9:05] <VurtualRuler98> Are you going to sue me?
[9:05] <AndrewPH> I mean you clearly own a copyright for their brains
[9:06] * Drakkar sets mode +b *!*Mibbit@*.tx.res.rr.com
[9:06] * clone|1018 was kicked from #minecraft by Drakkar
[9:06] <outsomnia> @ furrot Don't worry, you'll think that a lot while you're here, but you'll eventually get used to it.
[9:06] <VurtualRuler98> Are you, maggot?
[9:06] <VurtualRuler98> YAY
[9:06] <VurtualRuler98> Too bad I never got to call him a maggot though.
[9:06] <Speljohan_> <clone|1018> So if she made it for us. While working UNDER us. its OURs
[9:06] <Drakkar> if they evade again
[9:06] <AndrewPH> ah that was fun
[9:06] <Drakkar> i can't do shit
[9:06] <Speljohan_> actually he's got a point there
[9:06] <Drakkar> bug an actual oper
[9:06] <AndrewPH> Speljohan_, she didn't
[9:06] <Drakkar> hell
[9:06] <Speljohan_> would apply if this was a serious company or sumthin like that
[9:06] <Drakkar> ban evasion should be handled by opers anyway
[9:06] <AndrewPH> she made it for the general public and gave it to clone because he was the first person to want it
[9:06] <VurtualRuler98> but this is the internet
[9:06] <Speljohan_> i figured as much AndrewPH
[9:06] <VurtualRuler98> You're all pirates, right?
[9:07] <VurtualRuler98> just claim you pirated it
[9:07] <AndrewPH> she made it when clone asked for it since she was the only person at the time that knew java
[9:07] <Speljohan_> i am a contradictory pirate
[9:07] <Speljohan_> i hate piracy, but i occasionally pirate anyway!
[9:07] <AndrewPH> and for all he knows she made it for tktech and I separately
[9:07] <VurtualRuler98> You are either a full on pirate, or you do not pirate at all
[9:07] <VurtualRuler98> halfway-ing is just being a coward.
[9:07] <Speljohan_> being sensible
[9:07] <AndrewPH> I love how he's got all this bs about how he bought ipb
[9:07] <AndrewPH> he didn't
[9:07] <Speljohan_> 99% of what i pirate, i already own
[9:07] <Dommys> liez
[9:07] <outsomnia> Ah piracy
[9:07] <AndrewPH> he removed the one link that's illegal to remove
[9:07] <AndrewPH> the one in the footer that links to invisionpower
[9:08] <VurtualRuler98> anyways, this one shield ups my blocking DR by one, and ups my armor class by one.
[9:08] <vede> Thanks, Drakkar.
[9:08] <Speljohan_> lol AndrewPH...
[9:08] <VurtualRuler98> But, this OTHER shield, while having one less in both, gives a +1 resistance bonus on all saves.
[9:08] <Speljohan_> i realized that all free forum software worked shit under big websites
[9:08] <Speljohan_> and i realized that apache worked shit under big websites too!
[9:08] <AndrewPH> Speljohan_, Apache works fine, dunno what you're talking about
[9:08] <AndrewPH> iis works worse
[9:08] <AndrewPH> see:facepunch
[9:09] <Speljohan_> AndrewPH i switched to lighttpd
[9:09] <Speljohan_> and my cpu/mem load went down massively
[9:09] <VurtualRuler98> so guys, which shield do I take!?
[9:09] <VurtualRuler98> I don't even know if it stacks with my cloak, it probably doesn't.
[9:09] <furrot> IIS is like pulling teeth with a plyskool set
[9:09] <AndrewPH> Why does garry use iis
[9:09] <Speljohan_> actually, the latest IIS isn't that bad
[9:09] <AndrewPH> D:
[9:09] <Speljohan_> microsoft are starting to shape up
[9:09] <Speljohan_> (i was forced to take classes on it during college)
[9:10] <furrot> i've spent the last week deploying load balnced ssl certified sites in IIS... i need a vacation
[9:10] <vede> They're not really shaping up in the Evil department, and I doubt they ever will. :S
[9:10] <AndrewPH> I love exploding stars http://z.about.com/d/urbanlegends/1/0/-/7/eye_of_god.jpg
[9:10] <VurtualRuler98> one of the NPCs is saying "<string table error; tableDID"

[9:16] <Speljohan_> one of my favourite things to do online is insult world of warcraft VurtualRuler98
[9:16] <Speljohan_> because the fanboys are so crazy
[9:16] <VurtualRuler98> normally I'd not, but it's funny
[9:16] <Speljohan_> they are even funnier irl
[9:16] <vede> VurtualRuler98, what shield question?
[9:16] <Speljohan_> so, my town arranges a festival every year right
[9:17] <Speljohan_> 2 years ago we were there
[9:17] <VurtualRuler98> wether to use a shield with one extra AC and DR, or one with a +1 resistance bonus on all saves.
[9:17] <Speljohan_> and on our way home we walked by a lan-caf?
[9:17] <furrot> hehe, anyone can admit WoW is a good game. which makes it even more fun to rip on
[9:17] <Speljohan_> inside was a bunch of WoW-nerds
[9:17] <Speljohan_> so we went in and just said "LoL WoW is shit and gay"
[9:17] <Speljohan_> then left
[9:17] <VurtualRuler98> now he tells me "GO SLEEP WITH YOUR FLOOR LESBIAN GIRLFRIEND. YOU DOUBLE HERM."
[9:17] <AndrewPH> I like playing WoW with friends
[9:17] <Speljohan_> a minute later 6 angry nerds followed us
[9:17] <AndrewPH> just exploring and killing shit
[9:17] <Speljohan_> throwing cans of jolt coke at us
[9:17] <Speljohan_> we lold so hard
[9:18] <vede> furrot, I don't think Wow is a good game.
[9:18] <Speljohan_> it isn't vede
[9:18] <VurtualRuler98> then I say "k done", he starts asking if I'm called "the flash" or "sonic", or other bad insults, then I just say "multitasker"
[9:18] <Speljohan_> "sonic" isn't an insult
[9:18] <Speljohan_> :D
[9:18] <furrot> then again I haven't played since beta ended so I might be a little out of touch with it nowadays
[9:18] <VurtualRuler98> Men aren't supposed to finish in 10 seconds.
[9:19] <VurtualRuler98> or 2
[9:19] <Speljohan_> furrot you'd probably be disappointed
[9:19] <Speljohan_> most people are
[9:19] <Speljohan_> most of the so called oldschool wow players are anyways

[9:19] <Speljohan_> has not happened with eve vede
[9:19] <Speljohan_> lol
[9:20] <Speljohan_> and i doubt it will happen
[9:20] <vede> Something starts one way, ends up a bit different after a few years, and you'll almost always get people shouting about how much it sucks now.

[9:20] <Dudebro> I still don't get why the Dranei sided with the alliance
[9:20] <furrot> lol I tihnk in EVE people are more pissed but the investment go way beyond what a game would normally need
[9:20] <VurtualRuler98> Did WoW even actually rip off the d20 system at all?
[9:20] <VurtualRuler98> I don't know.
[9:20] <Speljohan_> well, in many cases it is very much justifiable vede
[9:20] <Speljohan_> i mean, look at ultima online
[9:21] <Speljohan_> what it could have become and what it ended up as
[9:21] <VurtualRuler98> and minecraft
[9:21] <vede> Speljohan, I don't mean going from development to release.
[9:21] <vede> I mean going from release to post-release.
[9:21] <VurtualRuler98> what it could have been: servers full of awesome projects, random sprites, and cool things so clustered you nearly lag out
[9:21] <vede> It actually was that for a few.. days, Vurtual.
[9:21] <VurtualRuler98> what it is: people hacking and making stupidly simple things, taking mere seconds, then disproportionately defending it.
[9:21] <VurtualRuler98> It can happen overnight.
[9:21] <Speljohan_> that's what i'm talking about here too vede
[9:22] <VurtualRuler98> actually on one server literally overnight
[9:22] <Speljohan_> third expansion started UO's demise
[9:22] <furrot> some of the creative stuff with stacking in ultima is pretty cool
[9:22] <Speljohan_> 4th gave it the killing blow
[9:22] <VurtualRuler98> day one: above super-awesome projects, day two: everybody has gigantic solid boxes with cheap, bad projects in them.
[9:22] <vede> But still, Speljohan_ in a pretty large number of cases, the 'veterans' will just get pissed off about anything changing at all.
[9:23] <furrot> TF2 players are a good example of that
[9:23] <Speljohan_> the first expansion was highly praised and introduced changes vede
[9:23] <Speljohan_> :P
[9:23] <vede> "This isn't what this game is supposed to be! This is Game! Not GameWhereYouGetTwoMoreBulletsThanBefore!"
[9:23] <Speljohan_> as well as the second
[9:23] <VurtualRuler98> rrrgh we had our ultimate wishes answered and now pyros can't just charge into battle VALVE WE ARE MAKING BAD MEME INSULTS AT YOU NOW
[9:23] <Speljohan_> the third (when ffa pvp was abolished) was the expansion that made people hate it
[9:23] * Smashing (Smashing@c-98-231-91-139.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:23] <vede> (Because if you just change the title to something longer to specify a very small detail, your argument wins. That's how game arguments function.)
[9:24] <Speljohan_> and the fourth expansion (rendered all crafting skills useless because loot was more valuable) made people hate it even more vede
[9:24] <vede> Speljohan_, okay, you've convinced me about UO.
[9:24] <furrot> halo: reach had some pretty funny threads because of the changes from halo 3
[9:24] <VurtualRuler98> so here's what we do gentlemn
[9:24] <Speljohan_> :P
[9:24] <VurtualRuler98> we raid EA
[9:24] <VurtualRuler98> and steal the deeds to UO
[9:24] <furrot> i was gonna do that anywats
[9:24] <Speljohan_> !
[9:24] <vede> But from everything I've seen, 'veterans' tend to get really pissy when *anything* changes.
[9:24] <VurtualRuler98> and release a freeware, possibly open source UO Classic.
[9:24] <Speljohan_> not really any need VurtualRuler98
[9:24] <VurtualRuler98> which will be the second age, with some tweaks, and revamped but classic graphics.
[9:25] <Speljohan_> RunUO is more sophisticated than the original game
[9:25] <VurtualRuler98> It'll be like new coke.
[9:25] <Speljohan_> server-side that is
[9:25] <VurtualRuler98> and also more illegal!
[9:25] <Speljohan_> actually it is completely legal
[9:25] <Speljohan_> :P
[9:25] <VurtualRuler98> not realllly
[9:25] <VurtualRuler98> It's just an insult to UO itself
[9:25] <Speljohan_> well, in essence all private servers are legal
[9:25] <VurtualRuler98> why?
[9:25] <Speljohan_> it's illegal to modify a client
[9:25] <Speljohan_> to run them
[9:25] <Speljohan_> because private servers do not use anything from the original game that can be copyrighted/put under patent
[9:26] <furrot> i'll change the bits on my harddrive at my liesure
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> it's morally wrong, you know.
[9:26] <Speljohan_> that is your moral stance

[9:26] <Speljohan_> :)
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> No no, that's not how right and wrong works.
[9:26] <furrot> that seems... merciful?
[9:26] <VurtualRuler98> It's not your moral stance if you consider it as valid as everyone else's.
[9:26] <Speljohan_> that doesn't change the fact it is still completely valid :)
[9:27] <VurtualRuler98> Here's how morals work: I am right, you are wrong. Unless I'm like, evil, then I'm intentionally wrong.
[9:27] <Speljohan_> u
[9:27] <vede> VurtualRuler98, you got it wrong too.
[9:27] <VurtualRuler98> and you're the good of my evil, then I kill you
[9:27] <leBMD> well this is an interesting conversation to walk in on
[9:27] <furrot> morals only exist to prove we're better then the creepers ;)
[9:27] <leBMD> SSSSSSSS-

[9:30] <VurtualRuler98> DF-elves are good too, furrot.
[9:30] <VurtualRuler98> lawful good.
[9:30] <VurtualRuler98> or lawful neutral, somewhere between.
[9:30] <VurtualRuler98> Yeah, lawful neutral, they value law over life.
[9:30] <vede> Although... I tend to run games where elves are basically useless plant-gatherers and fishers who speak a language no one understands because most people hate them and don't want to talk to them.
[9:31] <furrot> yeah that makes sense vurtual
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> dwarves are... are they lawful good?
[9:31] <furrot> neutral neutral
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> They have laws, though.
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> Do they care about them?
[9:31] <Speljohan_> i like elves in dragon age vede
[9:31] <furrot> only certain members
[9:31] <Speljohan_> oppressed minority :D
[9:31] <vede> Which setting are you guys trying to detail here?
[9:31] <furrot> the hammerer does, but not the populace
[9:31] <VurtualRuler98> Dwarf Fortress
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> So, elves are lawful neutral, dwarves true neutral.

[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> Are goblins evil, do they do things they consider evil, or just neutral also?
[9:32] <vede> Speljohan_, in all my D&D games, they used to be an oppressed minority, but after they got exiled and everyone stopped caring about them, they just kinda popped back up and no one minded.
[9:32] <furrot> hmm kidnapping is a pretty bad things and it a huge part of their culture
[9:32] <Speljohan_> lol vede
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> yeah, but is it bad to THEM?
[9:32] <furrot> it's a death and battle based culture
[9:32] <VurtualRuler98> That determines what.
[9:33] <Speljohan_> we tend to treat them as extinct in our d&d games vede
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> Klingons are all herioc warrior race guys, killing is bad to us, but not to them.
[9:33] <Speljohan_> klingons are awesome
[9:33] <furrot> thinking back to the last threetoe story it certainly gave a neutral perspective to the goblins
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> Wait
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> Does that make klingons lawful good?
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> or neutral
[9:33] <Speljohan_> considering their strong belief in tradition and laws i'd say so
[9:33] <VurtualRuler98> They do all their warrior race guy-ing for good.
[9:33] <furrot> is honorable = lawful?
[9:34] <wry> shitake
[9:34] <vede> But they have a tendency to try (and fail) at elaborate political tricks, and they've been at war with all three of the other groups, and every time they end up at war, their capital city just gets pummeled into the ground.
[9:34] <VurtualRuler98> their honor code is their law.
[9:34] <VurtualRuler98> so they're lawful for sure
[9:34] <Speljohan_> well, it all really depends what kling type you are talking about
[9:34] <Speljohan_> klingon*
[9:34] <Speljohan_> because
[9:34] <Speljohan_> there's the oldschool ones who only want wars
[9:34] <Speljohan_> and then there's the newfags who want political alliances
[9:34] <VurtualRuler98> the ones who weren't affected by the retcon disease
[9:34] <VurtualRuler98> TNG-era?
[9:34] <Speljohan_> o ok
[9:35] <Speljohan_> they are usually considered good due to their honourable ways of doing things
[9:35] <VurtualRuler98> but goblins don't strictly adhere to their murder-code.
[9:35] <Speljohan_> true
[9:35] <VurtualRuler98> so they're true neutral, too.
[9:35] <furrot> i think almost everything would turn out as neutral if you shift your perspective
[9:35] <VurtualRuler98> What about humans?
[9:35] <furrot> really have to set a starting point to judge
[9:35] <Speljohan_> depends on if you are subjective or objective
[9:35] <VurtualRuler98> They don't actively break any law, but certainly aren't active followers.
[9:36] <Speljohan_> generally humans are a scattered race in fantasy lore VurtualRuler98
[9:36] <VurtualRuler98> in DF, though?
[9:36] <Speljohan_> they usually aren't united
[9:36] <Speljohan_> oh, duno

[9:36] <VurtualRuler98> brb digging up stuff
[9:37] <furrot> kk
[9:37] <layla> DF, christ, is that out yet
[9:37] <furrot> new version came out a month ago
[9:37] <layla> i kinda gave up waiting 10 years ago :P
[9:37] <furrot> still a little rough but playable
[9:37] <Speljohan_> time to pirate music because i didn't have time to record from vinyl to cassette!
[9:37] <VurtualRuler98> They have a prroblem with: subordination, evil, untoward, negative, ugly, negator, culling those symbols.
[9:38] <VurtualRuler98> they have kingdoms and town-founders.
[9:38] <Speljohan_> layla, he's talking about dwarf fortress
[9:38] <furrot> how does ugly work?
[9:38] <Speljohan_> i assume you are talking about darkfall online
[9:38] <layla> oh lol
[9:38] <Speljohan_> loll
[9:38] <layla> yeah
[9:38] <Speljohan_> but yeah, darkfall has been out for a while
[9:38] <VurtualRuler98> They have many types of pets, they have extreme amounts of art about themselves, only exceeded by fanciful beings.
[9:38] <Speljohan_> shame it is just a pvp oriented game
[9:39] <Speljohan_> nothing else of value to do pretty much
[9:39] <VurtualRuler98> They can be undead
[9:39] <furrot> is undead evil?
[9:39] <VurtualRuler98> They normally make cities, they like cities. They tolerate cities, tree cities, and cave cities.
[9:39] <Speljohan_> i mean, if i want pvp as my only decent feature i'd play an fps or something
[9:39] <Speljohan_> they are not furrot
[9:39] <Speljohan_> for most of them are summoned
[9:39] <Speljohan_> which means it is not their will
[9:40] <Speljohan_> (if they have any)
[9:40] <furrot> looking at a concept like Halos flood certainly makes the argument that undead can be neutral while still being completely undesirable for the living
[9:40] <VurtualRuler98> They settle grasslands, shrublands, and savanna. They can live in wetlands, deserts, sometimes forests, potentially oceans and lakes, grasslands, savanna, shrubland, and especially river tied areas.
[9:41] <VurtualRuler98> They have merchant_nobility or something, diplomat bodygaurds, merchant bodyguards, have some special ingame value for population-driven siege, and are not known for it. They'll trade with anyone who advances a bit, and is friendly.
[9:42] <VurtualRuler98> They trade in the summer, they can siege, they can have fairly large amounts of cities and people, they have a pantheon-based religion structure, they can wander, and hunt beasts.
[9:42] <furrot> if they hate evil doesn't that make them good?
[9:42] <VurtualRuler98> not really, they could be neutral
[9:43] <VurtualRuler98> They can do most any jobs, and build walls, bridges, and roads accross the world.
[9:43] <VurtualRuler98> and now on the good stuff, ethics.
[9:44] <VurtualRuler98> They'll kill one of their own if justified for a good reason, they'll kill a neutral entity if there's no repricussion, they accept killing of enemies, animals, and plants. Torturing as example is acceptable, torturing for information is acceptable
[9:44] <Speljohan_> brb packing stuff
[9:44] <Dommys> brb torturing stuff
[9:44] <VurtualRuler98> Torturing for fun is appalling, they shun animal torture, capital punishment for treason, similarly oath breaking
[9:45] <VurtualRuler98> lying is a personal matter, serious punishment for: vandalism, tresspassing, theft, assault. Slavery is acceptable.
[9:45] <VurtualRuler98> They find eating other sapients, or sapient kills, unthinkable. They find making trophies of sapients, animals, and their own race acceptable.
[9:45] <AndrewPH> L4D zombies: They are not evil, they have rabies.
[9:45] <VurtualRuler98> They will accept tribute.
[9:46] <AndrewPH> Same deal with l4d2
[9:46] <VurtualRuler98> l4d zombies are chaotic neutral.
[9:46] <VurtualRuler98> they have no concept of rules, but are not actively trying to undermine things consciously.
[9:46] * leBMD is talking to an emo chick on omegle, and finds it interesting.
[9:46] <AndrewPH> HL2 zombies don't want to hurt you but the headcrab does
[9:47] <AndrewPH> they scream in agony all the time too
[9:47] <VurtualRuler98> Anyways, are DF humans lawful, neutral, or chaotic, and good, neutral, or evil?
[9:47] <AndrewPH> VurtualRuler98, they are dicks
[9:47] <VurtualRuler98> yeah
[9:47] <leBMD> same with cats
[9:47] <VurtualRuler98> I don't think evil would work, it's not like they do things they consider bad regularly, and they probably aren't good, because... they make trophies out of people sometimes.
[9:47] <AndrewPH> cats reproduce like a giant flying hooker
[9:47] <leBMD> you think they're awesome one second, the next they eat your stuff.
[9:48] <furrot> hmm that's funny when you realize dwarves wouldn't use their remains trophies
[9:48] <AndrewPH> VurtualRuler98, Think about this, we see them as bad, but do they see themselves as bad?
[9:48] <VurtualRuler98> So, everybody's true neutral?
[9:48] <VurtualRuler98> they don't.
[9:48] <furrot> makes humans seem worse then dwarves
[9:48] <VurtualRuler98> goblins are the closest to evil in the game.
[9:48] <AndrewPH> Imagine us irl
[9:48] <furrot> is'nt there an evil tag?
[9:48] <VurtualRuler98> furrot, dwarves just haven't been explained enough for you to not like them
[9:48] <AndrewPH> we don't imagine ourselves as bad
[9:48] <AndrewPH> yet we kill other species
[9:48] <AndrewPH> for fun even
[9:48] <AndrewPH> they see us as bad
[9:48] <VurtualRuler98> actually, goblins might be evil
[9:49] <VurtualRuler98> they do like the conept of evil
[9:49] <AndrewPH> VurtualRuler98, no they're just annoyingly retarded
[9:49] <VurtualRuler98> okay, elves: lawful neutral, humans: true neutral, dwarves: true neutral, goblins: neutral evil.

[9:50] <furrot> seems about right, although if you cross compared the ethics it would be a different story for the allignments
[9:50] <VurtualRuler98> animal peoples and kobolds don't have most concepts of rules applied to them.
[9:50] <VurtualRuler98> just a few, which they don't even think about.

[9:52] <furrot> nope :P
[9:52] <VurtualRuler98> actually, dwarves might be lawful.
[9:52] <leBMD> k, just wondering
[9:52] <furrot> dwarves might be chaotic
[9:52] <VurtualRuler98> because the sheer amonut of extreme repricussino for simple things.
[9:52] <VurtualRuler98> the only potentially comprehendably bad things they don't punish for, are making trophies of animals.
[9:53] <VurtualRuler98> and killing of enemies, animals, plants
[9:53] <VurtualRuler98> crimes are severely punished, while things like torture are entirely unthinkable.
[9:53] <furrot> is there an alignment for extra stupid
[9:53] <Speljohan_> there, packed and ready!
[9:53] <VurtualRuler98> neutral
[9:53] <VurtualRuler98> is the closest you can get
[9:54] <VurtualRuler98> So, dwarves and elves: lawful neutral.
[9:54] <VurtualRuler98> humans: true neutral
[9:54] <VurtualRuler98> goblins: neutral evil
[9:54] <VurtualRuler98> now the real question is, if someone laxed elf and dwarf rules, would they be friends
[9:56] <VurtualRuler98> actually, elves might be good, or neutral, depends.

[10:24] <VurtualRuler98> He asked about what was essentially feats in this "baby game"
[10:24] <I-merican> He joins a chat, and the person says, "Look behind you." He turns around, and there's a moth directly behind his face.
[10:24] <VurtualRuler98> He thought that was the gear

[10:34] <f00> sup
[10:34] * VurtualRuler98 pulls out a page in the form of an old, musty tome, labelled "Evocation", marked with many flowing purple designs
[10:35] <I-merican> Is force disk a mobile platform?
[10:35] <VurtualRuler98> Well, floating disk: http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Floating_Disk
[10:35] <I-merican> Ah, ok.
[10:35] * laCour|Offline is now known as laCour
[10:36] <VurtualRuler98> 3 feet diameter disk of force energy, one inch deep at the center, capible of carrying one hundred pounds per caster level.
[10:36] <I-merican> Sounds useful.
[10:36] <VurtualRuler98> If I could use it in DDO, as some kind of fighter spell that defies normal standards, I could easily carry 400 pounds of stuff with me.
[10:36] <I-merican> At higher levels, can you ferry people around?
[10:36] <VurtualRuler98> including loot.
[10:36] <VurtualRuler98> By second level, probably.
[10:37] <I-merican> I mean, if it can hold a hundred more each level.
[10:37] <I-merican> At some point could you just carry the whole team?
[10:37] <VurtualRuler98> by second level yes unless your DM is like NO NO THAT'S CHEATING
[10:37] <VurtualRuler98> But it's only 3 feet in diameter, so you can't fit more than a person or two.
[10:37] <I-merican> My DM is often three years younger than me and does not give a damn about anything.
[10:37] <VurtualRuler98> Would he let you, you think?
[10:38] <I-merican> I'd say so.
[10:38] <I-merican> In fact, he'd probably be like "Woah, that's awesome dude!"
[10:38] <VurtualRuler98> A few casters working together, of high level, could carry a house.
[10:39] <VurtualRuler98> say, 10th level ones, capible of carrying half a ton each, could carry a two ton object by commanding their disks to move in formation. They could not move beyond like, 50 feet from that corner, but it'd still work.

[11:45] <VurtualRuler98> or basically 50d8 health or more over 50 rounds.

[12:46] <Budda> prob
[12:46] <Budda> glg etting favor to unlock drow though
[12:47] <VurtualRuler98> well, you want me to make a wizard.
[12:47] <VurtualRuler98> so I'm just going to quest.
[12:47] <VurtualRuler98> A lot.
[12:47] <Budda> i didnt say wiz
[12:47] <Budda> i said another char
[12:48] <Budda> i changed FvS to sorc
[12:48] <VurtualRuler98> I'm not making anything but a wizard now.
[12:48] <Budda> much better
[12:48] <Budda> and you can skip the island
[12:48] <VurtualRuler98> Anything else would be too similar to my omnifunctinoal fighter.
[12:48] <Budda> when you tlak to the very first guy on the beach
[12:48] <Budda> he has an option to skip it all
[12:48] <VurtualRuler98> Even wizard is similar relatively, just farthest.
[12:48] <VurtualRuler98> after all that questin for drow though?
[12:48] <VurtualRuler98> Result should be a fighter of high enough level, that he no longer levels fast enough, and probably has decent gear, or at least more fighter-boredom.

[12:49] <Budda> i wanna do all quests on elite
[12:50] <Budda> done the first 5 or so
[12:50] <Budda> 4 more to go on korthos, then ill come to harbour
[12:50] <wry> i would, but all y'all are too high level
[12:50] <Budda> im lvl 2
[12:50] <VurtualRuler98> I'm just fourth level :|

[12:50] <VurtualRuler98> is so hillarious
[12:50] <VurtualRuler98> It's like some kind of gerudo midget oprah.
[12:50] <wry> Budda: hmm, well, we should quest then

[12:51] <Budda> you on cannith wry?

[12:53] <VurtualRuler98> k, I'm fourth level though
[12:53] <VurtualRuler98> if I only had actual money, then I could just unlock drow, and get a shared bank, more quests.
[12:53] <Budda> lol, if you make more characters and do the first few quests on them, you get a fair amount of store points pretty quickly
[12:54] <VurtualRuler98> yeah, but that's farming
[12:54] <VurtualRuler98> number one, that's farming
[12:54] <VurtualRuler98> number two, that's farming.

[13:56] <VurtualRuler98> because of CS
[13:56] <Maksie99> cs?
[13:56] <Roadcrosser> my cousin's pet name on PS
[13:56] <Roadcrosser> CS is
[13:56] <Roadcrosser> Cave Story or
[13:56] <Icereed> he felt of one when he was a boy
[13:56] <Roadcrosser> something else
[13:57] <Maksie99> what does cave story have to do with ladders?
[13:57] <Nuky> Notch should make every block 1x1x1 cm instead of 1x1x1 m, and then make it more voxel-based, and for lighting you would have to make a generator and hang lights every few meters on the roof, and you would need to build support frames, and to carry out your stuff you would need rails and wagons.

[13:57] <Maksie99> is anyone else noticing that minecraft seems to be turning into wurm online?
[13:58] <Maksie99> only an easier, quicker version
[13:58] <VurtualRuler98> well who's making it?
[13:58] <Icereed> no
[13:58] <VurtualRuler98> currently infdev is mostly notch's vision for the game
[13:58] <layla> actually it would probably be faster to scale the player
[13:58] <VurtualRuler98> except the infinite maps
[13:58] <Maksie99> yes, i know notch worked on wurm
[13:58] <VurtualRuler98> that was suggested in
[13:59] <Icereed> cant wait for mp
[14:00] <Nuky> What I hope comes next after signs are actual natural caves =P
[14:00] <Maksie99> yeah
[14:00] <Maksie99> i'd also like multiple kinds of environments
[14:00] <VurtualRuler98> oh, ddo DOES have inflict spells
[14:00] <Maksie99> at the moment all of infdev looks roughly the same...
[14:00] <VurtualRuler98> they're now necromancy apparently
[14:00] <VurtualRuler98> even though they still work like evoking
[14:00] <Nuky> Like snowy mountains and glaciers and hot deserts and stuff?

[14:01] <Nuky> Rain forests and other forests?
[14:01] <Maksie99> and maybe a giant tree here and there
[14:01] <Nuky> Oh man, giant trees.
[14:01] <Maksie99> giant trees would be such awesome places for fortresses
[14:01] <Nuky> Landmarks are awesome, too.
[14:01] <Icereed> i will build a glAss factory in the desert
[14:01] <rcfighter> Giant trees WOULD be a good place for forts...
[14:01] <Maksie99> easy to tunnel through, easy to defend, and just freaking huge
[14:01] <Nuky> Indeed.
[14:01] <rcfighter> Until some idiot comes along with flint.
[14:02] <rcfighter> DURR HURR I MAEK FIRE
[14:02] <Maksie99> good point...
[14:02] <Nuky> Exactly =P
[14:02] <Nuky> Was just about to say.
[14:02] <Maksie99> maybe there could be some sort of item or spell to make wood fire resistant
[14:02] <rcfighter> Thats why you line your tree fort with stone, and build the outline for a floating island
[14:02] <rcfighter> So if the tree gets burned
[14:02] <rcfighter> your base stays intact

[14:03] <Nuky> Didn't he mention he'll be adding a creature or two soon?
[14:04] <rcfighter> A self-sustaining floating island.
[14:04] <Icereed> he did

[14:04] <Nuky> I wonder what they'll be.
[14:04] <rcfighter> Slimes or something
[14:04] <Maksie99> a nest could spawn on trees or cliffs and it would have eggs
[14:04] <Maksie99> it could work
[14:05] <Nuky> I vote for small creatures gliding quickly from tree to tree, trying to get your head while at it.

[14:05] <Maksie99> that gives me an idea
[14:05] <rcfighter> They just leap.
[14:05] <Maksie99> CRABS
[14:05] <Maksie99> crabs could work
[14:06] <rcfighter> Sponge mobs come first, hopefully
[14:06] <Maksie99> they walk around at beaches and fight back when attacked
[14:06] <Icereed> if they had wings?
[14:06] <rcfighter> Sitting in one spot underwater

[14:07] <Maksie99> yeah

[14:10] <Maksie99> i hate how when you low shit up it leaves all those little floating blocks

[14:10] <Icereed> floating islands
[14:10] <Maksie99> don't we have those?
[14:10] <slowriot> but like, obsidian, remember
[14:10] <Icereed> theyd fall
[14:11] <Maksie99> o_o
[14:11] <slowriot> only things with obsidian veins would float
[14:11] <Maksie99> sounds dangerous
[14:11] <Maksie99> ahh right
[14:11] <Maksie99> and floating islands would have those
[14:11] <slowriot> he actually talked about that before, a while back
[14:11] <Maksie99> maybe we could combine obsidian with magic
[14:11] <slowriot> the main problem is figuring out if something is floating or not
[14:11] <Maksie99> like make it mineable but very hard
[14:11] <slowriot> as if it extends beyond a given area, well...
[14:11] <Maksie99> and then you can do crap with it
[14:11] <slowriot> also

[14:12] <slowriot> win
[14:12] <Icereed> imagine youre standing under a floating island an you get gravity via instantupdate
[14:12] <Maksie99> i have another idea
[14:12] <Maksie99> chisels!
[14:12] <rcfighter> Squish.
[14:12] <Maksie99> you can use it on log or rock blocks to make statues
[14:13] <slowriot> imagine yuo're standing under a floating island and some cock above you mines out the obsidian vein
[14:13] <slowriot> same effect
[14:13] <Maksie99> or on cobblestone to make a stone sign thing on it
[14:13] <rcfighter> I forgot how to toggle the FPS display in indev/infdev

[14:17] <Maksie99> no more making those damn spiral stairways in mines
[14:17] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I hope he updates soon.
[14:17] <slowriot> i want doors
[14:17] <slowriot> and trapdoors
[14:18] <slowriot> and levers
[14:18] <slowriot> and pumps
[14:18] <slowriot> and dwarf fortress
[14:18] <Maksie99> yesh
[14:18] <Maksie99> traps would be awesome
[14:18] <Maksie99> maybe pressure plates
[14:18] <Chocolatey_Syrup> And I know I speak for all of us when I say I'm really looking forward to working water, re-implemented cave systems, and trees you that don't make you take down every single leaf block manually.
[14:18] <Nuky> Well, ladders are fine and all, sure
[14:18] <Nuky> But poor notch. =)
[14:18] <Chocolatey_Syrup> But I'm probably not speaking for everyone when I say I'd rather have those things sooner than doors and furniture.
[14:18] <Maksie99> he had his break, it's work time for him now
[14:19] <Chocolatey_Syrup> uh
[14:19] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I don't think anyone disagrees with that sentiment, Maksie
[14:19] <VurtualRuler98> ladders will make design easy
[14:19] <Chocolatey_Syrup> including Notch
[14:19] <slowriot> i don't give a rat's ass about furniture, what's the point?
[14:19] <slowriot> when it's multi that'd be great
[14:19] <Nuky> Hmm, I think I might agree with Syrup.
[14:19] <slowriot> all the decoration stuff would be ace then
[14:19] <slowriot> but when it's just solipsist universe, i'd rather have actual gameplay
[14:19] <Maksie99> i wonder how multiplayer is going to work
[14:19] <slowriot> so things like doors, traps etc contribute to that
[14:19] <slowriot> caves do too of course
[14:20] <Maksie99> like if there's going to be seperate servers like creative is now, or if its going to be one big mmo-ish world
[14:20] <slowriot> well surely the whole point of infinite is that it's one world
[14:20] <Maksie99> yes, thats what i thought
[14:20] <slowriot> otherwise, why bother?
[14:20] <Maksie99> but having a server to accomodate that many people might be costly
[14:20] <liq3> I think the number of servers will go down, mostly due to players... But I dobut we'll get one big MMO thing.
[14:21] <liq3> slowriot: because infinite maps are awesome?
[14:21] <Maksie99> time to eat stuff
[14:22] <Budda> theres no way itd be one inf-map server
[14:23] <Budda> some douche would just autowalk for a few hours so the map file is a few TB huge
[14:23] <liq3> ...
[14:23] <liq3> Budda: ... no.
[14:23] <Budda> ye
[14:23] <liq3> assuming it saves the entire map, that'd only do like a few mb.
[14:23] <Budda> if you walked for say, a week then?
[14:24] <Dommys> EEK EEK monkey says
[14:24] <liq3> a few mb x (week / few hours)
[14:24] <liq3> :P
[14:25] <liq3> more seriously, a 256^3 chunk is 16mb.
[14:25] <Budda> 256^3 map is pretty small
[14:25] <liq3> players move rather slow... i forget how slow. ;(
[14:25] <Nuky> It takes you some time to walk, though
[14:26] <Budda> BUT NOTCH WILL ADD FLYING HURR
[14:26] <Dommys> My biggest infdev world is just under 9MB
[14:26] <Dommys> and I played it for.. over 2 weeks?
[14:26] <Nuky> Without auto-walk =)
[14:26] <Dommys> Yes.
[14:26] <Nuky> But yeah
[14:26] <Nuky> It would take some dedication to bring the file-size up a whole lot.
[14:27] <Nuky> It wouldn't increase traffic much either, I believe.
[14:27] <liq3> i dunno what the movespeed is, but it's like 1-2 blocks per second.
[14:27] <liq3> bah i figured it out a while ago and didn't write it down. :(
[14:27] <Nuky> =)
[14:28] <slowriot> isn't the whole point of the seeded infinite maps that you don't have to download the whole thing from the server?
[14:28] <slowriot> and walking in one direction isn't going to generate a massive file because you're only incrementing areas linearly, not expanding the squared area
[14:29] <Nuky> Yeah

[16:17] <VurtualRuler98> the sentence makes fine sense in context
[16:17] <Marach> wait what
[16:17] <VurtualRuler98> English, although not used that way, is very context-sensitive sometimes.
[16:17] <VurtualRuler98> "although not used that way, is very context-sensitive sometimes"

[16:18] <Marach> it does
[16:18] <VurtualRuler98> alone
[16:18] <Merciless> makes sense to me
[16:18] <VurtualRuler98> "although not used that way, is very context-sensitive sometimes" seems like a complete sentence to you?
[16:18] <Marach> it does make sense. we just don't know what's "it"

[16:18] <VurtualRuler98> You all suck at English-ing and I still haven't rolled a wizard.
[16:18] <Merciless> not a stand alone sentance
[16:18] <Marach> it's even a complete sentence, actually
[16:18] <VurtualRuler98> no subject
[16:19] <VurtualRuler98> OKAY, I HAVE FIGURE OUT HOW TO PICK WETHER OR NOT TO ROLL A WIZARD
[16:19] <VurtualRuler98> I will, every DDO quest complete, subtract the favor I earned from a Difficulty Class, as a will value on a save, and roll to see if I can become wizard or not
[16:20] <VurtualRuler98> additionally, incomplete challenges for my fighter are other modifiers.
[16:20] * Marach is SO not going to ask what VurtualRuler98 is talking about
[16:20] <VurtualRuler98> I am thinking about rolling a wizard in DDO
[16:21] <Marach> but it's a roll
[16:21] <Marach> you don't control
[16:21] <VurtualRuler98> I'm indecisive
[16:21] <VurtualRuler98> and it has no long-term problem
[16:21] <VurtualRuler98> So, every time I get closer to wizard, I'll also have further enhanced my fighter.
[16:21] <Marach> i don't get it
[16:21] <VurtualRuler98> The roll will be intially impossible, due to the sheer amount of things my fighter should have complete.

[16:56] <Visiiri> I don't think it's even been implimented in my area yet
[16:57] <Quatroking> protip: just use your own wifi
[16:57] <Visiiri> Actually, there's a new fiber cord being installed in Idaho at a predicted 2014
[16:57] <Visiiri> I do plan to rent space.
[16:57] <VurtualRuler98> Budda, did you delete that rogue you made?
[16:57] <Quatroking> 2014?!
[16:57] <Quatroking> lmao
[16:58] <Visiiri> Hey, this is IDAHO
[16:58] <Visiiri> We've got ONE avalible ISP
[16:58] <Visiiri> DDDDD:
[16:58] <Quatroking> fffaaaaggsss
[16:58] <Quatroking> Here in holland they're deploying fiber everywhere
[16:58] <Budda> VurtualRuler98, ummm, maybe
[16:58] <Budda> yeah
[16:58] <VurtualRuler98> check
[16:58] <VurtualRuler98> aww
[16:58] <Budda> i deleted it to make the ranger
[16:58] <Quatroking> "now, fiber for only 20 euros a month!"
[16:58] <VurtualRuler98> I need some trap disabler for this lightning trap objective
[16:58] <Budda> roll through it
[16:59] <Budda> noob
[16:59] <Quatroking> and then, when you agreed to the contract they charge you deployment costs because there is no fiber in your area
[16:59] <Visiiri> From what I hear it's really powerful shit.
[16:59] <VurtualRuler98> it's an OBJECTIVE
[16:59] <Visiiri> They actually expect some larger ISPs to switch to their fiber
[16:59] <Quatroking> Fiber is internet at the speed of light
[16:59] <VurtualRuler98> secondly, heavy armor.
[16:59] <VurtualRuler98> Huge boost to AC, but tumble is hurt
[16:59] <Visiiri> And more people to make ISPs on their fiber.
[16:59] <Quatroking> The only thing that limits fiber are the decoders
[17:00] <Visiiri> Yup.
[17:00] <Budda> [00:59:30] <Quatroking> Fiber is internet at the speed of light
[17:00] <Budda> so is copper...
[17:00] <VurtualRuler98> oh no, levers.

[17:00] <Quatroking> not at all
[17:00] <Budda> and its shit
[17:01] <Visiiri> Copper isn't that conductive.
[17:01] <Quatroking> copper cable loses power every few meters, while light doesn't
[17:01] <Budda> exactly
[17:01] <Budda> its just as fast

[18:54] <blaster> I cannot find a single borderlands game without hacked guns
[18:55] <blaster> The 4th one I joined had two 9 year olds who thought they were awesome because they used hacked guns, and kicked me and this other person for wanting to play legit
[18:55] * sllide (ekstezie@ip565eb113.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft
[18:56] <blaster> And all the servers are like that
[18:56] <Quatroking> sounds like minecraft, blaster
[18:56] <blaster> Yes it does
[18:56] <blaster> Too bad nobody else here has borderlands for xbox
[18:56] <Jacob_> Or roblox
[18:57] <PuyoDead> Hence why I only play Borderlands singleplayer.
[18:57] <blaster> Jacob do you think it would be possible to program a diablo clone in roblox?
[18:57] <Jacob_> Might be, you can do just about anything with scripting
[18:57] <Jacob_> I've never played Diablo
[18:58] <blaster> Jacob, it has randomly generated weapons and armor
[18:58] <blaster> I could handle the equipment screen with a GUI, but I am not sure about making functional random weapons and armor
[18:58] * Mithril (Mithril2@e54013.upc-e.chello.nl) has joined #minecraft
[18:58] <blaster> And the game would take hours to get it balanced correctly
[18:58] <Jacob_> Put the damage and stuff in Values, instead of hard coding them
[18:59] <blaster> Thats what I was thinking
[18:59] * PixelScum (PixelScum@ip98-177-172-248.ph.ph.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
[19:00] <blaster> damage.value = itemlevel.value*(rand+0.5)
[19:00] <blaster> For an example
[19:00] <blaster> But thats not how rougelike itemgeneration works, you usualy add prefix and suffix bonuses to weapons
[19:01] <blaster> Like the difference between a Katana and a Firey Katana

[19:06] <blaster> BTW thats one of the 2 scripts I used to make infinite maps in roblox
[19:07] <Jacob_> I almost made a Minecraft-style terrain generator once
[19:07] <Jacob_> but I couldn't get the random noise function to work
[19:08] <blaster> That is not a true random noise
[19:08] <Jacob_> Yeah, that's what I meant
[19:08] <Jacob_> takes an x and y parameter
[19:08] <blaster> It takes the hight of the last square the player is on and changes it slightly
[19:08] <blaster> for the surrounding squares
[19:09] <Jacob_> The thing I was making would generate the whole map when the server started
[19:09] <blaster> There is a seperate variable to decide whether it prefers going uphill or downhill, which changes only occationaly
[19:10] <blaster> Jacob, even if you dont play any more, does not mean you cannot program any more
[19:11] <VurtualRuler98> hahahaha you play roblox
[19:11] <blaster> hahahaha we are not playing any of the usual shit that comes out of noobs asses
[19:11] <VurtualRuler98> hahahaha you play roblox
[19:11] <blaster> Hahahaha want to play multiplayer monopoly?
[19:12] <Budda> only shit from notch's jewel encrusted ass blaster?
[19:12] <blaster> Yep
[19:12] <blaster> Vurtual we are planning to make a diablo clone in lua, just because we are using roblox as a base does not make it any worse
[19:13] <Marach> hahahaha you play roblox
[19:13] <blaster> hahahaha I made infinite map generation before notch with it
[19:14] <blaster> hahahahaha with only 50 lines of code
[19:14] <Marach> hahahaha you play roblox
[19:14] <Jacob_> I had a 16,000 block place
[19:14] <Jacob_> took me 4 weeks to make
[19:14] <Jacob_> then they updated
[19:14] <Jacob_> now it lags so bad it's unplayable
[19:14] <Jacob_> They also lagged up my LEDScreen script
[19:15] <blaster> Jacob I can run 80,000 blocks
[19:15] <blaster> Blocks generated by scripts are much less laggy
[19:15] <blaster> They have less variables assigned to them
[19:15] <Marach> someone do something
[19:15] <Marach> i can't look at #minecraft becoming this
[19:15] <blaster> As in, blocks created from scripts are more 'default' than any block that is created normaly

[19:35] <C418> ladders are stupid
[19:35] <Cial> he gave in
[19:35] <C418> haven't had a single game where they were okay
[19:35] <VurtualRuler98> What about half-life 2?
[19:35] <VurtualRuler98> It had good ladder handling
[19:35] <Cial> i personally wanted elevators
[19:35] <C418> no, I fell down quite often too
[19:35] <Kizzycocoa> other than that, I am really going to hate minecraft in the near-future :D
[19:35] <VurtualRuler98> not the first half-life
[19:36] <VurtualRuler98> first half-life was a nightmare
[19:36] <gbee> i dont see anyone with your name??
[19:36] <Quatroking> he doesn't mention ladders.
[19:36] <Kizzycocoa> he does
[19:36] <VurtualRuler98> even in their most raw, unsupported form, half-life 2 had good ladder use

[19:37] <Quatroking> VurtualRuler98, actually my name translates directly to Cemetery.
[19:37] <VurtualRuler98> If you, say, had been a sane mapper, and added all the proper qualities a ladder would need, the ladder would function very smoothly, and you could fly around all you want.
[19:37] <VurtualRuler98> aaaa
[19:37] <Quatroking> JoeyJo0, yes.
[19:37] * VurtualRuler98 turns undead at Quatroking

[19:37] <VurtualRuler98> you did, really?
[19:37] <JoeyJo0> No shit
[19:37] <VurtualRuler98> I find that hard to believe.

[19:37] <VurtualRuler98> spoilers
[19:37] <gbee> hmmm... i would rather have the idea through the crafting system
[19:37] <Quatroking> Anyways, wrenches would be nice
[19:37] <Kizzycocoa> dos anyone know if the infdev->indev move will happen anytime soon? or has he not said?
[19:37] <Vicrry> well
[19:37] <Kizzycocoa> *does
[19:38] <Quatroking> and I think it would work nice in combination of "building blocks"
[19:38] <Vicrry> It'll be more like indev->infdev
[19:38] <Vicrry> And no, no ideas
[19:38] <Kizzycocoa> well, he's going to call it indev
[19:38] <Kizzycocoa> I think
[19:38] <Quatroking> infdev = indev
[19:38] <Kizzycocoa> and damn x_x
[19:38] <gbee> isn't more like indev->infdev->indev?
[19:38] <Kizzycocoa> yeah

[19:38] <Kizzycocoa> *but
[19:38] <Quatroking> sexual
[19:38] <VurtualRuler98> I simply cannot wait for ladders.
[19:38] <Kizzycocoa> it's sorta like, survival, indev, beta
[19:38] <Kizzycocoa> with an arm
[19:38] <gbee> yeah
[19:39] <Kizzycocoa> like a D shape
[19:39] <Quatroking> VurtualRuler98, where the hell does he mention ladders
[19:39] <gbee> survival is alot funner than creative :P

[19:39] <VurtualRuler98> didn't he?
[19:39] <Quatroking> oh

[19:39] <Quatroking> yeah he did.
[19:39] <VurtualRuler98> last post
[19:39] <Kizzycocoa> I?ll go eat lunch, then get cracking on that. :D
[19:39] <Kizzycocoa> Also, OK FINE, I will add ladders.
[19:39] <Quatroking> With a tone like in my comic
[19:39] <VurtualRuler98> Because, firstly, houses can be more awesome.
[19:39] <Kizzycocoa> ^^quote
[19:39] <Kizzycocoa> uh
[19:39] <Kizzycocoa> not to you two
[19:39] <Kizzycocoa> XP
[19:39] <gbee> ladders is awesome
[19:39] <VurtualRuler98> You could simply carve a semi-tall room, and then have a ladder to a little loft where you store items, free from creepy blasts.
[19:40] <gbee> then you can crawl up to your treehouse :D
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> or really, really lame towers.
[19:40] <Kizzycocoa> not if implemented badly
[19:40] <Kizzycocoa> look at HL2
[19:40] <JoeyJo0> "Also, OK FINE, I will add ladders."
[19:40] <Quatroking> This is how Notch feels about ladders, probably: http://www.quatroworld.org/
[19:40] <Kizzycocoa> you can fall off easy
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> ...
[19:40] <Kizzycocoa> and get stuck
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> not hl2
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> You guys mix up the ladders a lot, don't you?
[19:40] <Kizzycocoa> at the to
[19:40] <Kizzycocoa> *top
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> Half-life had the bad ladders.
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> While half-life 2 had the good ones.
[19:40] <Kizzycocoa> #2 does too
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> in half-life 2, you had to actually jump off to fall off.
[19:40] <Kizzycocoa> like, try to jump off at the top
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> by hitting jump
[19:40] <Quatroking> I liked the ladders in Link's Awakening
[19:40] <VurtualRuler98> walk forward to get off, or jump and hold W like a sane person?
[19:40] <Quatroking> they worked great
[19:41] <Kizzycocoa> hold it down like 90% of people will, and it'll like, be stuck in a jump/on thing
[19:41] <Kizzycocoa> *it's
[19:41] <VurtualRuler98> no more like 35% or 45% range
[19:41] <Kizzycocoa> still. a huge proportion
[19:41] <Kizzycocoa> should be directional based
[19:41] <VurtualRuler98> and I've never had the problem of being stuck
[19:41] <Kizzycocoa> not surface-based
[19:41] <VurtualRuler98> except where ladders had props in the way
[19:42] <VurtualRuler98> in garry's mod.
[19:42] <Merciless> hold w ladders are godlike
[19:42] <VurtualRuler98> suface based?
[19:43] <Cial> hey guys how well is infdev running?
[19:43] <VurtualRuler98> ok here's how minecraft ladders can work: Water.
[19:43] <Cial> on low end machines not the god mod monsters you bound you your desk
[19:43] <Cial> *to your
[19:43] <gbee> water is kinda slow
[19:44] * gdude2002 is now known as laiC
[19:44] <laiC> Hai.
[19:44] <gbee> hello
[19:44] <VurtualRuler98> except you can't sink down, move faster with higher friction, and are clamped if you don't hold space or something, so you can hold space and then walk off.
[19:44] * laiC is now known as gdude2002
[19:44] <gbee> yeah
[19:44] <gbee> that would be nice
[19:45] <gbee> very nice
[19:45] <Kizzycocoa> surface based means, trying to dismount the ladder, but going left/ right instead of straight ahead
[19:45] <VurtualRuler98> or just identical to water, maybe without sinking and above friction change.
[19:45] <VurtualRuler98> Are you talking about the ladder endpoint things, Kizzycocoa?
[19:45] <VurtualRuler98> hl2 can support you being able to just walk directly off the ladder without hitting anything special.
[19:46] <Kizzycocoa> yeah. I've had to create a lot in hammer. while being a good idea, usually implemented badly
[19:46] <VurtualRuler98> if it's properly built into the map, just look in the general direction, and get off.
[19:46] <VurtualRuler98> I think some people just have a grudge against hl2 ladders because they're ladders.
[19:46] <VurtualRuler98> what just happened some NPCs vanished in DDO
[19:46] <VurtualRuler98> they have their little spots, but no NPC.
[19:47] <Kizzycocoa> no. they're terribly coded. that's why
[19:47] * layla (mykei@5ad53564.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
[19:47] <VurtualRuler98> No really, I don't see any problem with them.
[19:47] * Dragoon (gdhammerbo@96.239.139.254) has joined #minecraft
[19:47] <Dragoon> Diabeetus
[19:47] <VurtualRuler98> It's like if someone went up and told you how much some random mouse or joystick sucks inherently because of how bad it was made, yet you use it regularly and have no idea what they're talking about.
[19:48] * Maiger (chatzilla@a88-112-28-138.elisa-laajakaista.fi) has joined #minecraft
[19:48] <VurtualRuler98> He should sell other kinds of testing supplies
[19:48] <gbee> hmm.. when infdev MP comes out, and a guy falls into a whole, and if he rejoins the server, will he spawn the same place? and what if the place is occupied?
[19:48] <VurtualRuler98> like radiation detection testing supplies
[19:48] <gbee> hole*
[19:48] <VurtualRuler98> you should warp out
[19:48] * TW|Gone is now known as TrueWolves
[19:48] <layla> vector subscript out of range :P
[19:48] <gbee> yeah, but where :Pp
[19:49] <TrueWolves> MUAAAHAHAHA
[19:49] <VurtualRuler98> on your own
[19:49] <Kizzycocoa> they're hard to dismount as holding jump causes you to get stuck in an endless on/off/on/off cycle. it's like he's got amnesia and doesn't know what he wants to do, but occuring within 0.2 seconds
[19:49] <VurtualRuler98> Kizzycocoa, no really, i've never seen that.
[19:49] <VurtualRuler98> except when the ladder was placed into a wall
[19:49] <VurtualRuler98> Are you speaking from ladders you placed?
[19:49] <Kizzycocoa> nope. HL2 ladders
[19:49] <VurtualRuler98> in hl2
[19:49] <gbee> if they would spawn the nearest place, 2 persons could glitch eachother everywhere.
[19:49] <Kizzycocoa> too many to count
[19:49] <VurtualRuler98> never, ever dealt with that in a normal ladder with any regularity.
[19:50] <Quatroking> Kizzycocoa, how about learning how to play a fucking videogame
[19:50] <Kizzycocoa> like, the ones in the antlion chapter. nover prospect's ladders
[19:50] <Quatroking> its a goddamn ladder
[19:50] <VurtualRuler98> prospect?
[19:50] <Quatroking> Get some guts already
[19:50] <VurtualRuler98> anyways, warping out
[19:50] <Kizzycocoa> uh, I do know how to play videogames. god, did my comment on how the ladders are bad really warrant all this?
[19:50] <VurtualRuler98> and yes it did
[19:50] <Kizzycocoa> howso?
[19:51] <Kizzycocoa> ugh
[19:51] <Kizzycocoa> how about it just stays there
[19:52] <Kizzycocoa> and no-one discusses ladders from HL2 at all again
[19:52] <Kizzycocoa> X3
[19:52] <VurtualRuler98> A few blocky sparkles surround the player, player slows down, and then after a few seconds, they're surrounded by thick sparkles, that whiten the logouter's vision if they're watching, with a soundeffect getting louder, particles swirling, and then a big boom that does some graphical effect, and pushes people away forcefully.
[19:52] <JoeyJo0> HL2:Ep3 ladders are awesome.
[19:52] <VurtualRuler98> then the player is not there
[19:52] <VurtualRuler98> yeah JoeyJo0
[19:53] <VurtualRuler98> especially the fighting zombies while on them.
[19:53] <JoeyJo0> YEah
[19:53] <gbee> EP3 ladders?
[19:53] <GoaLitiuM> ep3 ladders?
[19:53] <GoaLitiuM> wtf
[19:53] <JoeyJo0> Love the new Source engine.
[19:53] <GoaLitiuM> i see they trollin
[19:53] <VurtualRuler98> and alyx climbing through the bars of the wreckage.
[19:53] <JoeyJo0> That part is awesome.
[19:53] <VurtualRuler98> and the destroyed second silo
[19:54] <JoeyJo0> By the way, you can get the gnome again.
[19:54] <JoeyJo0> But you can't fully make it due to some bug.
[19:54] <VurtualRuler98> woah in the topic of ddo I have noticed that suddenly, I can grab onto almost any flat edge now
[19:54] <VurtualRuler98> I made a big jump, grabbed a house edge, and then made another big jump and landed on some bridge pillars.
[19:54] <JoeyJo0> DDO?
[19:54] <JoeyJo0> Dungeons and Dragons online?
[19:54] <VurtualRuler98> yep
[19:54] <JoeyJo0> Ah
[19:55] <JoeyJo0> Too bad you can't do that in Ep3
[19:55] <VurtualRuler98> use the grab weapon.
[19:55] <JoeyJo0> There is?
[19:55] <JoeyJo0> I should update.
[19:55] <VurtualRuler98> It's always been there
[19:56] <VurtualRuler98> it's the thing you use to climb the special stuff
[19:56] <JoeyJo0> I've never seen it.
[19:56] <VurtualRuler98> it can also ledge-grab
[19:56] <JoeyJo0> Oh, THAT.
[19:56] <JoeyJo0> I never knew that.
[19:56] <VurtualRuler98> it can also safely catch you on things like concrete and other partially-solid materials.

[19:57] <VurtualRuler98> grab that

[19:57] <VurtualRuler98> if you do, they'll stretch down, maybe snap, and you can fall slower with them.

[19:59] <Kodaichi> it's probably not even being developed right now...
[19:59] <VurtualRuler98> it is
[19:59] <VurtualRuler98> they've been working on it since ep2
[19:59] <VurtualRuler98> infact they chain-link all their projects
[20:00] <VurtualRuler98> so it's like, their improvements continue constantly, by the time they've finally locked down all the shiny things, they'll have another game, which they can continue to work on.
[20:00] <Kodaichi> well slowly, because they've released a few entirely new games since then
[20:01] <VurtualRuler98> normal valve stuff
[20:01] <JoeyJo0> Actually, the reason Ep3 is still being worked on is the advanced source engine.
[20:01] <gdude2002> Has anyone seen this?: http://udk.com/showcase-sanctum

[20:16] <VurtualRuler98> new keybinds

[20:18] <VurtualRuler98> cool, styled icons for items
[20:18] <VurtualRuler98> so rather than "blocky pork," you get a vellum background, and a nice iamge of the object.
[20:19] <VurtualRuler98> object items, blocks, tools, entity blocks, and such, could all have their own backgrounds.

[20:33] <gear1> mineshafts would be good
[20:33] <gear1> so you dont have to build some spiral staircase from hell
[20:33] <rob`> I usually just dig diagonally to get down anyway
[20:34] <TrueWolves> MARACH
[20:34] <rob`> although, the ability to build single-block vertical shafts would be nice
[20:34] <rob`> it's a higher digging efficiency than 2x1 shafts
[20:35] * Lord_Aidan (chatzilla@67-40-179-244.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:35] <rob`> I guess it depends on how high ladders can go, and how narrow they are
[20:35] <rob`> and whether you can pull them up after yourself
[20:36] <rob`> it'd make it even easier to get up defensive walls :<
[20:36] <Lord_Aidan> Siege ladders?
[20:36] <Lord_Aidan> Something I want to see in indev...
[20:36] <Lord_Aidan> is a pig launcher.
[20:37] <rob`> indev is dead, all development happens in infdev now
[20:37] <Lord_Aidan> in infdev then.
[20:37] <rob`> what would it be for, artillery to attack people with?
[20:37] <Lord_Aidan> Yeah
[20:37] <Lord_Aidan> Or, for supply food
[20:38] <Lord_Aidan> You launch it into a castle
[20:38] <Lord_Aidan> and it dies, making bacon
[20:38] <Kizzycocoa> indev>infdev. (awaits flaming)
[20:38] <Lord_Aidan> Or, you load a creeper into it

[20:39] <rob`> if you have a computer that can handle it, infdev is nicer because of the prettier lighting. But I miss caves and working water. :/
[20:39] <Kizzycocoa> but, someone said indev is dead
[20:39] <Kizzycocoa> caves, water, less lag, reliability
[20:39] <Kizzycocoa> etc.
[20:40] <Merciless> infdev is great imo
[20:40] <TrueWolves> indev will be ported in to infdev
[20:41] <TrueWolves> As in, limited level size will be an option in infdev, and infdev is slowly getting indev's features
[20:41] <rob`> ^
[20:41] <Kodaichi> I still like indev more
[20:41] <Lord_Aidan> Yep
[20:41] <Lord_Aidan> Well
[20:41] <Lord_Aidan> The one thing
[20:42] <Lord_Aidan> I would love above all in indev
[20:42] <Lord_Aidan> Is hidden someware in the map
[20:42] <Lord_Aidan> is a small jewel
[20:42] <Lord_Aidan> And when you grab it..

[20:48] <Kizzycocoa> yeah. but they should have an animation for it
[20:49] * pachuco523 (Mibbit@p4FC950DA.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:49] <Lord_Aidan> Yeah, that would be awesome
[20:49] <Lord_Aidan> a leash you could make
[20:49] <gdude2002> or even summons
[20:49] <Lord_Aidan> And if you hit a mob with it
[20:49] <Kizzycocoa> also, don't you find it like you're the monster in indev sometimes?
[20:49] <gdude2002> xD
[20:49] <Lord_Aidan> It might become your pet
[20:49] <gdude2002> it's a good idea
[20:49] <Kizzycocoa> I mean, all of them hate you, and you kill animals
[20:49] <gdude2002> but then
[20:49] <gdude2002> you'd have to feed it
[20:49] <gdude2002> and take it for a shit
[20:49] <Lord_Aidan> Yeah
[20:49] <gdude2002> etc
[20:49] <gdude2002> lol
[20:49] <Lord_Aidan> It would add a whole new dynamic
[20:49] <gdude2002> yeah
[20:49] <Kizzycocoa> and no way is farming or mushroom soup as plentiful as pigs
[20:49] <ZiggyPox> hello everybody, did Notch mentioned something about update today? I can read on his blog that there is alot work to do.
[20:50] <Lord_Aidan> No

[20:50] <Kodaichi> it's june 2nd
[20:50] <Lord_Aidan> Lol
[20:50] <Kodaichi> nope 3rd
[20:50] <Lord_Aidan> Nope, 4th
[20:50] <PandaBear> Apparently theres signs in in(f)dev nao?
[20:50] <blaster> Why did he not release the sign update
[20:50] <Lord_Aidan> Really?
[20:50] <Kizzycocoa> and if anyone says they've never killed pigs for their meat, they're complete liars.
[20:51] <PandaBear> What blaster said, then
[20:51] <gdude2002> he didn't release it
[20:51] <gdude2002> lol
[20:51] <blaster> There are not signs yet, he did not upload the updated game
[20:51] <gdude2002> pff.
[20:51] <PandaBear> I has kept about 15-20 pigs/sheep as pets
[20:51] <Kizzycocoa> it would only take a commited vegan to not eat a pig
[20:51] <PandaBear> In my indev time
[20:51] <PandaBear> :P
[20:51] <Kizzycocoa> very commited
[20:51] <Kizzycocoa> lol X3
[20:51] <PandaBear> :3
[20:51] <ZiggyPox> @Kizzycocoa- I LOVE killing pigz :P
[20:51] <ZiggyPox> the sound that they make hehe
[20:51] <Kizzycocoa> I love shoving them off cliffs
[20:51] <Lord_Aidan> I think something interesting would be writing
[20:51] <ZiggyPox> it makes me moist ;]
[20:52] <Kizzycocoa> ..............
[20:52] <Lord_Aidan> You put a stick in fire
[20:52] <Kizzycocoa> took it a step too far
[20:52] <PandaBear> I can barely even take the sheep's wool, let alone kill one :3
[20:52] <Lord_Aidan> And it becomes a charcal stick
[20:52] <Lord_Aidan> or however its spelt
[20:52] <Kizzycocoa> I shear sheep a lot. I don't kill them
[20:52] <Kizzycocoa> no point
[20:52] <Lord_Aidan> And then you can skin sheep
[20:52] <Kizzycocoa> nothing is gained
[20:52] <Lord_Aidan> To get hide for parchment
[20:52] <ZiggyPox> @PandaBear- i only wish that sheeps would drop meat to
[20:52] <ZiggyPox> hehehe

[21:06] <Drakkar> it doesn't
[21:07] <ZiggyPox> all day same thing around
[21:07] <VurtualRuler98> It seems just messing around is an intrinsic ability.
[21:07] <VurtualRuler98> and when you combine some kind of game that is inherently fun without being an MMO?

[21:18] <ZiggyPox> but all that "you need play everyday and make level becouse they gona overrun you" tahes all fun away
[21:19] <VurtualRuler98> One of the fun things in DDO is that lots of people will try crazy things like multiclass into rogue for one misc ability, and then reroll entirely because of it, or because they... don't like their hairstyle.
[21:19] <Vicrry> I tried Maplestory once. Couldn't do anything cause every instance was filled with some hacker killing everything and hoovering up the loots

[21:21] <VurtualRuler98> Up to 4th level, you'll take a rank every quest or two, and elite quests will get you even more.
[21:21] <VurtualRuler98> until 7th level, apparently levelling is still fast.
[21:21] * laCour|ZzZ is now known as laCour
[21:21] <ZiggyPox> like in all mmorpg ;/\
[21:22] <VurtualRuler98> Yeah, but you're not mindlessly killing things for XP.

[21:22] <ZiggyPox> bevore.. omg.. my english skillaz is decaying >_>
[21:23] <VurtualRuler98> The only thing it's missing is your party forming in the tavern, then you'd literally have "you gather at the tavern and buy from shops, then talk to some guy at a tavern and he talks about some thing, and you go on and adventure"
[21:23] <VurtualRuler98> and that most quests, so far, takes place indoors.
[21:24] <ZiggyPox> hmm sounds like this is something better than normal MMORPG, something diffrent
[21:24] <Vicrry> Do a quest. The reward items suck? Repeat the quest. But since it's your second time thru, the reward items suck more.
[21:24] <ZiggyPox> but sometimes interesting gameplay suck at some point
[21:24] <VurtualRuler98> nah
[21:24] <ZiggyPox> like in "gunbots"
[21:24] <ZiggyPox> it was funny and diffrent
[21:24] <VurtualRuler98> The reward items, if they aren't that great, you sell them for money.

[21:25] <ZiggyPox> making brickwall was something that would took you whole day
[21:26] <VurtualRuler98> I'm still waiting for one of the quests to reuse a puzzle or concept.
[21:26] <ZiggyPox> and monthly payment
[21:26] <ZiggyPox> non-used skill level decay
[21:26] <Vicrry> It's different from normal MMO's in that you're not randomly killing everything in sight for XP. Instead you're randomly repeating quests for additional XP. The problem I was having was how dependant on pure luck getting good gear was.
[21:26] <VurtualRuler98> okay there are hundreds "kobolds in sewers, kobolds are baaad, kill kobooooolds."
[21:26] <VurtualRuler98> who repeats quests :|
[21:26] <ZiggyPox> repeating
[21:26] <VurtualRuler98> well, immediately at least
[21:27] <VurtualRuler98> You'll do a bunch, then maybe go back to some on hard/elite, and do more.

[23:25] <rob`> ufo defence had it all - tactical and strategic gameplay, logistics, world-building, politics
[23:25] <TrueWolves> building a castle using only half blocks is... intresting, but it looks cool.

[23:30] <blaster> But then my map has about 50 houses
[23:30] <blaster> I used stone, it is built in the middle of a lake, there is a bridge to reach it
[23:30] <blaster> I might add a tunnel to the bottom of the ocean and then constuct a basement
[23:32] <Quatroking> So I was just drawing a comic featuring Notch

[23:38] <blaster> Ok, Er, should I begin splitting the blocks page into smaller pages
[23:38] <blaster> Or not
[23:38] <Quatroking> Get it back like we had it previously
[23:38] <Quatroking> the whole "everything on one page" thing failed miserably
[23:38] <blaster> A seperate page for each block?

[23:47] <PandaBear> I once had a link for that
[23:47] <PandaBear> But I lost it
[23:47] <PandaBear> :x
[23:47] <Quatroking> blaster: yes, but don't include the crafting scheme
[23:47] <Quatroking> link to the craft design on the crafting page
[23:47] <blaster> Um... How about link to the finished good itself
[23:47] <Zoltarization> Hurray for Thunderstorm 2 days in a row <.<
[23:47] <blaster> And have seperate pages for each finished good
[23:48] <blaster> But keep the crafting pahe
[23:48] <blaster> page

[23:53] <Quatroking> uh
[23:53] <Quatroking> what do you mean?
[23:54] <Quatroking> They already link to the pages that belong to each type
[23:54] <blaster> Like a page for spade
[23:54] <Quatroking> nah
[23:54] <Quatroking> link them to the spade on the crafting page
[23:54] <blaster> But we cannot put block digging times on the crafting page
[23:54] <Quatroking> I'm currently getting rid of any already-existing gear pages because their summaries are pretty much identical to the ones on the crafting page
[23:55] <Quatroking> Why not?
[23:55] <blaster> Because it would increase the size of the page to Blocks page levels
[23:55] <Quatroking> Hm
[23:56] <Quatroking> Rename the page to Crafting and Tools

[23:59] <Quatroking> lemme put my firefox in 1024x768 mode
