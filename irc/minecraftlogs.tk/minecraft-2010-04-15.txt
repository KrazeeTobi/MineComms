[0:00] <Azathoth> blaster, why do you want to do this so badly?
[0:00] <Azathoth> are you trying to scare someone by making them think they're being 1337 haxx0rzed?
[0:00] <blaster> No
[0:01] <blaster> Its so I can instant message inside my school
[0:01] <Azathoth> then it's really rather pointless

[0:01] <chibifs> ...
[0:01] <Azathoth> why would you need to do that?

[0:01] <Azathoth> they wouldn't be able to talk back because of your school's firewall and stuff
[0:01] <Azathoth> unless you're communicating within the school network
[0:01] <Azathoth> in which case....

[0:33] <vurtual> then a winding path in a green tube
[0:33] <Azathoth> you don't have nearly as high up speed as you do down
[0:33] <vurtual> My up speed is generally higher than down
[0:33] <Vicrry> 5 more to go :(
[0:33] <vurtual> do not ask why
[0:33] <vurtual> but somehow, it is
[0:33] <Azathoth> that doesn't make sense
[0:33] <Azathoth> what kind of connection?
[0:33] <vurtual> I DON'T KNOW WE GET 100 KBYTE UP, AND 60 KBYTE DOWN
[0:33] <vurtual> dsl
[0:33] <Azathoth> only 60 down?!
[0:33] <Azathoth> how do you live?
[0:34] <vurtual> very slowly
[0:34] <Azathoth> also. wtf 100 up?
[0:34] <vurtual> actually most pages load instantly
[0:34] <Azathoth> well pages, yeah
[0:34] <vurtual> the ONLY thing we can't do is download steam games quickly
[0:34] <setveen> moo

[0:36] <Azathoth> i have unlimited bandwidth
[0:37] <vurtual> Azathoth "slightly higher" unlimited?
[0:37] <Serow> Spears would be cool. Take a sword, put it on the top of the crafting block, and then two sticks under it. XD
[0:37] <vurtual> I can run servers(slow servers), run torrents
[0:37] <ClassiestMedic> I just trapped a sheep in some tnt... >:D
[0:37] <Azathoth> i mean i don't have limited downloads or anything
[0:37] <vurtual> actually I think the 100kbyte kicked in when I ran a server first
[0:37] <vurtual> serow that'd not be a spear

[0:39] <vurtual> spears are basically sharp sticks that you ram into somebody's guts very hard

[0:39] <Serow> Sooo... Put an arrow on the end of two sticks? :D
[0:39] <Azathoth> ok so that's about 1.875 mbps down and only like 60kbps up
[0:39] <vurtual> pikes rae realllllly long
[0:39] <vurtual> serow more like an arrowhead MAYBE
[0:39] <Azathoth> so vurtual's shitty dsl has a better up rate than my cable!?
[0:39] <vurtual> an iron bar and 2 sticks

[0:41] <vurtual> having how it's made and mythbusters in here would pwn.
[0:41] <Azathoth> serow, rofl
[0:41] <vurtual> serow the difference here is that we have the money
[0:41] <vurtual> it's just that the money is apparently a waste
[0:41] <vurtual> Normally everyone here is cautious with money actually, just... sometimes priorities are screwed up.
[0:42] <Brett> uh... here i'm lucky if i get 1 mbps down
[0:42] <Brett> usually about 60% of that

[0:42] <vurtual> everything here is entirely limited to 60kbyte
[0:42] <Azathoth> mine too
[0:42] <vurtual> per second
[0:43] <Yourself> like downloading something from steam i can get around 1.5 MB/s
[0:43] <vurtual> as that's what we pay for, the other options being in the low mbits
[0:43] <Azathoth> me too. it's miraculous
[0:43] <vurtual> but nothing is specially limited or blocked, absolutely anything can be done if you can stand mildly high pings on servers hosted
[0:43] <Azathoth> considering when i first started using the internet i was lucky to get 1kbps
[0:43] <Yourself> i remember those days
[0:43] <vurtual> my brother used to run a torrent server for himself, giving him ubuntu updates and movies
[0:43] * vede tries Chrome.
[0:43] <Yourself> i remember when 5 kbps was a good speed
[0:43] <vurtual> average day for him was like
[0:44] <Azathoth> yeah lol
[0:44] <vurtual> "What should I watch?" *scrolls through like 50 pages of movies he's got*
[0:44] <Yourself> now i get irritated if it's less than 300
[0:44] <blaster> I remember when a 1mb ram was good
[0:44] <vurtual> Then we all just sorta annoy him about how it's bad and he doesn't care
[0:44] <Azathoth> "what should i watch?" *scrolls through a million pages of streaming video on the internet*

[0:45] <vede> Yourself, kb/s or kB/s?
[0:45] <Yourself> kB
[0:45] <vurtual> so basically if my brother were here, everyone would be complaining
[0:45] <Azathoth> kb = kB
[0:45] <Azathoth> you mean Kb?
[0:45] <vede> You get irritated when you don't get 300kB/s or more?
[0:45] <vede> Azathoth, no.
[0:45] <Yourself> kb = is kilobits
[0:45] <Yourself> kB is kilobytes

[0:46] <Azathoth> wait
[0:46] <Azathoth> what the fuck
[0:46] <Azathoth> the naming schemes are fucked
[0:46] <vede> With all the abbreviations, b is bit, and B is byte.
[0:46] <Yourself> vede, i get marginally irritated down to 200
[0:46] <Yourself> i get actually annoyed if it's below 150
[0:46] <Azathoth> why the fuck is a megabit Mb and a kilobit is kb?

[0:48] <vurtual> why not just say kbit and kbyte
[0:48] <Drewseph_> so
[0:48] <Azathoth> that doesn't answer my question
[0:48] <Drewseph_> are torches really fixed?
[0:48] <Azathoth> i mean what the fuck is the point of the unit?
[0:48] <Yourself> network speeds are usually measured in bitrates because that's the more relevant measurement
[0:48] <Serow> We should measure everything in a standard value of porn. :[
[0:48] <Drewseph_> any other bugs?
[0:48] <TG^Weaver> Azathoth, that's how the metric abbreviations work
[0:48] <vurtual> we should measure everything in pps
[0:48] <vurtual> porn-per-second
[0:48] <Serow> "Man, this game takes up 17 faps..."
[0:48] <Azathoth> no
[0:48] <vede> Do you know what the difference between a kilobyte and a megabyte is?
[0:48] <ClassiestMedic> XD
[0:48] <Azathoth> vede, stfu
[0:48] <Azathoth> you don't understand waht i'm asking
[0:48] <vurtual> standard porn images per second
[0:48] <vede> What the hell are you asking?
[0:48] <Yourself> vede: depends on whether or not you're a hard drive manufacturer
[0:48] <Azathoth> why the fuck do we use the stupid ass "bit" measurements for anything?
[0:49] <AlexVMiner> >:3
[0:49] <Azathoth> they seem so abstract and useless
[0:49] <Yourself> Azathoth, i just explained that
[0:49] <TG^Weaver> Because that's the standard unit of measurement for computer space?
[0:49] <Azathoth> when the byte measurements are what really matters?
[0:49] <vurtual> mpps would me megaporns per second, equivelant of one standard definition porn video(1 min worth)
[0:49] <Yourself> bits are what's actually transmitted over a network
[0:49] <vede> Azathoth, because bits and bytes are different.
[0:49] <Azathoth> i know this
[0:49] <TG^Weaver> Yeah bits are actually what's being used here
[0:49] <vurtual> gigaporns is porn games, and kiloporns is GIFs
[0:49] <Yourself> in any form of serial communication, you measure the number of bits that can go through in a certain time
[0:49] <vede> So you're saying we should just not have anything for people who want to measure bits?
[0:49] <Azathoth> but bytes make more sense as a form of measurement
[0:49] <Yourself> because you don't transmit bytes, you transmit bits
[0:49] <vede> Also: what Yourself said.
[0:50] <Azathoth> *sigh*
[0:50] <vurtual> so my connection is like 0.5-1 porns range I think
[0:50] <vede> Generally, when you're talking about telecommunications, you'll see megabits, kilobits, etc.

[0:50] <AlexVMiner> divide by 0
[0:50] <Yourself> SATA*
[0:51] <vurtual> the 3-4 porns range
[0:51] <vurtual> that's like
[0:51] <vurtual> 3-4 porn images a second guys
[0:51] <vede> Either way, it's stupid easy to remember.
[0:51] <vurtual> and that's awesome
[0:51] <Azathoth> i think ISPs just use the bit measurements to confuse customers
[0:51] <vede> small b is the smaller unit.
[0:51] <vurtual> yeah Azathoth
[0:51] <vurtual> and the 1000/1024 argument is too
[0:51] <vede> Azathoth, they don't, but it still does it. ;)
[0:51] <vede> It's just a side effect.
[0:51] <Azathoth> they see Mb and think (oh i can download 20 megabytes per second. fuck yea)
[0:51] <Azathoth> err
[0:51] <vurtual> 1gbit :D
[0:51] <Azathoth> don't know why i used ()
[0:51] <vurtual> 128mbyte
[0:51] <Azathoth> i meant to use quotes?
[0:52] <vede> Yeah, the 1000 and 1024 crap is frustrating as hell.
[0:52] <bildramer> :l
[0:52] <Azathoth> anyway, when we're talking connection speeds, it just seems to make more sense to me to use the same units of measurement as people are used to using with computers
[0:52] <bildramer> 2^10 ftw
[0:52] <vede> Since measurements on any sort of product will use the standard giga, mega, etc.
[0:52] <Vicrry> http://sites.google.com/site/miningvicrry/home <- for the lazy :P
[0:52] <vurtual> I want to start a company that pretends like it's saying bit
[0:52] <Azathoth> you don't say "hey i'm sending you this 10^6 bit file!"
[0:52] <vurtual> but the whole time is saying byte
[0:52] <vede> But a computer will always measure it with gibi, mebi, etc.
[0:52] <vurtual> so you buy a 512kbyte connection
[0:53] <Azathoth> you say i'm sending you a "whatever byte file"
[0:53] <Azathoth> you know?
[0:53] <vurtual> hard drives will be in 1024
[0:53] <vurtual> anyways giga and mega and kilo are all 1024s when it comes to computers and this is now officially final
[0:53] <vede> Azathoth, we're not talking about file sizes here.

[0:53] <Serow> Oh man, I totally can't chew gum anymore. I've bit my lip like 16 times. :[
[0:53] <vurtual> welcome to it
[0:53] <Yourself> also sound quality is measured in bitrate
[0:54] <Azathoth> they are still measurements for numbers of bits
[0:54] <Azathoth> and they make more sense to me
[0:54] <rbos> people who use 2^n to approximate metric units are communists nazi pinko terrorists.
[0:54] <vede> Azathoth, just because they make more sense to you as a user doesn't mean that measuring bits is useless.
[0:54] <Kratospie> yeah
[0:54] <Kratospie> Co-op modes gonna be fun for about 10 seconds
[0:55] <Azathoth> co-op?

[0:55] <Dysgalt> damnt i really want a upside down stair block
[0:55] <Kratospie> if your playing online multiplayer
[0:55] <vurtual> Kratospie no it'll be fun for a long time
[0:55] <Kratospie> its gonna get fucking terrible
[0:55] <vurtual> imagine left 4 dead in 2 player
[0:55] <vurtual> with portals
[0:55] <Yourself> portal 2 was officially announced over a month ago
[0:55] <vurtual> instead of left 4 dead it's portal
[0:55] <Azathoth> i'm not just an average user
[0:55] <bildramer> do crops grow in infdev?
[0:55] <vede> Didn't Valve say that they tested MP with Portal but that it wasn't fun at all?
[0:55] <Kratospie> I dunno
[0:55] <Kratospie> but its offical in Portal 2
[0:55] <vurtual> vede they changed their mind
[0:55] <Azathoth> but from my experience with computers, powers of two are more applicable than SI measurements
[0:56] <vurtual> "Wait a second this IS awesome if we do it right. Awwwessommmme"
[0:56] <vede> Azathoth, yeah, they are.
[0:56] <Yourself> the commentary in the first one mentioned it was one of the most desired features
[0:56] <Kratospie> heres the Co-op players
[0:56] <Kratospie> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9f/Portal2_coop_characters.jpg
[0:56] <Yourself> and that they toyed around with it
[0:56] <vede> And there's a separate set of prefixes for powers of two.
[0:56] <Yourself> but couldn't make it fun
[0:56] <Azathoth> though ii do not have any experience with networking
[0:56] <Kratospie> with Co-op mode
[0:56] <bildramer> wtf
[0:56] <Yourself> of course, that was when it was like 5 people working on the game
[0:56] <vurtual> I call dibs on sphere guy Kratospie
[0:56] <bildramer> the framerate drops then infdev just crashes
[0:56] <Kratospie> both players can use 2 portals
[0:56] <Kratospie> so 4
[0:56] <bildramer> fuck Java, seriously
[0:56] <Kratospie> and they can use the others
[0:56] <Azathoth> vede, i know there's a seperate set of prefixes. i didn't say there wasn't?

[0:56] <vurtual> that'd be trippy if you all had 4 portals
[0:57] <Kratospie> I dont think they can "Connect" between the two different kinds of portals
[0:57] <Serow> They tried multiplayer with Portal 1, but it was Versus mode multiplayer. Portal 2 gets Co-Op, which should totally be more fun.
[0:57] <vurtual> like, 2 sets to use, and r switched them
[0:57] <Kratospie> Yeah
[0:57] <vede> Azathoth, so what the hell are you trying to say? Are you just trying to agree with me here?
[0:57] <Kratospie> But yeah sphere guy looks awesome
[0:57] <Azathoth> no, i'm saying why the hell do we have two types of measurement for the same exact thing?
[0:57] <Yourself> because they're not the same
[0:57] <vurtual> anyways guys I'm bored what should I do
[0:57] <vede> Azathoth, the same reason we have a bunch of measurements for the 'exact same thing'

[0:57] <Yourself> the only relationship between them is that bytes are made from bits
[0:58] <vede> Azathoth, do you understand why we have kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes?
[0:58] <Yourself> but if you're sending bits, it doesn't necessarily mean you're sending bytes
[0:58] <Azathoth> yes, vede
[0:58] <vurtual> everything
[0:58] <vede> Then you should understand why we have a different measurement for bits.
[0:58] <vurtual> mass, volume, length
[0:58] <Azathoth> yourself, isn't everything transfered in units of bytes?
[0:58] <vurtual> internet speed

[0:58] <Azathoth> networking doesn't make a lot of sense to me
[0:59] <vede> Do you think that we should stop using those prefixes and just say "I have a 10276397 byte file here."?
[0:59] <Yourself> because you can't shove 8 bits down a single wire at the same time
[0:59] <Azathoth> you shove them down the wire in series
[0:59] <Yourself> yeah, and they're bits
[0:59] <Azathoth> but in groups of 8 bits
[0:59] <vede> No. As single bits.
[0:59] <Yourself> there's nothing on the wire that logically groups them
[0:59] <Yourself> on the wire it's a plain bit stream
[1:00] <Azathoth> true, but they're sent and received in groups of bytes, no?
[1:00] <Yourself> the only thing that makes them into bytes is when a device at one end decides to group them that way
[1:00] <vurtual> guys
[1:00] <Azathoth> yeah?
[1:00] <vurtual> in a few years
[1:00] <setveen> moo
[1:00] <vurtual> we turned the volume of a gigantic storage system
[1:00] <Azathoth> so if the end result is the same, who the fuck cares if they're individual bits on the network?
[1:00] <vurtual> into a cheap thing the size of your fingernail
[1:00] <vurtual> A whole library building could fit on your fingernail

[1:01] <Azathoth> err
[1:01] <Azathoth> byte*
[1:01] <Azathoth> lol
[1:01] <Yourself> you can send half a byte
[1:01] <vede> Azathoth, why wouldn't you?
[1:01] <Yourself> that's 4 bits
[1:01] <Azathoth> HALF OF 8 IS 4?
[1:01] <Azathoth> no way
[1:01] <vurtual> half a bit is like
[1:01] <vurtual> ( or '
[1:01] <Yourself> you can't send anything less than a bit
[1:01] <vurtual> the nyou have the other half: ) or |
[1:01] <vurtual> combined you get () or '|

[1:02] * Lord_Aidan (chatzilla@63-226-219-24.tukw.qwest.net) has joined #minecraft

[1:03] <Lord_Aidan> Lol
[1:03] <Malikat> i just want to start eating sauce
[1:03] <Malikat> i've never made sauce this good.
[1:03] <Malikat> ever.
[1:03] <Malikat> i want to fuck this sauce bbl
[1:03] <vede> Azathoth, I think a huge mistake you're making is mentally separating bytes and bits.
[1:03] <Kratospie> lol
[1:03] <Azathoth> how so?
[1:03] <vede> Because you're acting like bytes matter and bits don't.
[1:03] <bildramer> saucefucker
[1:03] <Azathoth> i accidentally typed bit instead of byte earlier. but i am well aware of the difference

[1:04] <blaster> 8Bit minecraft http://i41.tinypic.com/2s5xpc3.png

[1:04] <vede> Azathoth, uh.
[1:04] <vede> You're talking about bits and bytes.
[1:04] <blaster> Bits
[1:04] <Azathoth> and?
[1:04] <blaster> either a 0 or 1

[1:08] <Azathoth> no

[1:09] <Topple> what
[1:09] <Yourself> bits/s is the logical choice for serial communication, period
[1:09] <rbos> Yourself: what do you mean by that? 8 bits/sec is one byte/sec. Is that wrong?
[1:09] <Malikat> 8 bytes = 256 outcomes?
[1:09] <Azathoth> did i say megabyte?
[1:09] <Topple> yep
[1:09] <vede> A megabit is 1000000 bits.
[1:09] <Malikat> that would be 8 bits.

[1:10] <AndrewPH> they're hungry
[1:10] <Topple> no idea
[1:10] <Malikat> this conversation bytes
[1:10] <Prevail> Just bought indev an hour ago. Loving every second.
[1:10] <Yourself> so while you may see a certain number of bytes being sent by the device, the network sees more
[1:10] <Azathoth> i'm confused why there's 2, possibly 3, naming conventions for the same thing
[1:10] <Azathoth> thank you yourself
[1:10] <Azathoth> that clears it up a bit
[1:10] <Yourself> the maximum throughput in terms of bits, however, does not change

[1:11] <Cubex|Phone> Bye all!
[1:11] <AndrewPH> blaster, I was afraid you would have linked the creeper porn
[1:11] <vede> We have different measurements for bits and bytes for the same reason we have different measurements for bytes and kilobytes.
[1:11] <AndrewPH> which is highly disturbing
[1:11] <Azathoth> yourself's explanation of the network using extra bits clears some of it up
[1:11] <Yourself> the thing is, communication protocols add overhead to transmitted data
[1:11] <vurtual> you mean hot right AndrewPH
[1:12] <vurtual> right
[1:12] <Yourself> the network itself will always have some maximum number of bits it can push through
[1:12] <Topple> I was just thinking of changing the texture of creepers to have a pack of TNT strapped to it
[1:12] <blaster> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Flash/minecraft%20lol.swf
[1:12] <Yourself> the way that translates into bytes depends on the protocol overhead
[1:12] <Topple> 's chest so it cound be 20% more explosive in my mind
[1:12] <blaster> There is your block porn
[1:12] <Yourself> and the protocol is largely independent of the network itself
[1:13] <vurtual> So seriously I have this awesome image of a spaceship hangar but making it would be near-impossible currently
[1:13] <Azathoth> so you're saying that while a network can have X Mb bandwidth, not all of it translates into actual download rates or whatever, right?

[1:13] <Luingar> hey, legacy
[1:13] <Azathoth> that's all i needed to know
[1:13] <Azathoth> vede for some reason turned it around into me not knowing what a byte is or something
[1:13] <rbos> Yourself: that's a tortured line of argument, and you're sorta right, but it doesn't change that 1024 bits shoved over the cable is still 128 bytes. You're just saying that higher up the stack, some of the bandwidth is discarded?
[1:13] <Yourself> and a service provider can't always accurately state what that will be in bytes
[1:13] <blaster> I am bored
[1:13] <vede> Azathoth, no I didn't.
[1:13] <Serow> Anybody know if saplings will grow into trees on /infdev/ at this point?
[1:14] <vede> Azathoth, you were saying you didn't know why we measured both bits and bytes with different abbreviations.

[1:49] <Cial> 42?
[1:49] <Azathoth> actually, gordon has pretty good aim, considering he fires from the hip
[1:49] <vurtual> the smg will hit roughly in that area
[1:49] <Azathoth> yes, cial ><
[1:49] <vurtual> which means from accross a table you will have a 1 foot spray area
[1:49] <blaster> Thats a lambda vurtual
[1:50] <vurtual> blaster the crosshair

[1:51] <Azathoth> he doesn't even aim
[1:51] <LuciferZ> Ja. About that webhosting offer on the forums.
[1:51] <vurtual> at 7 paces you could easily miss a person with an smg
[1:51] <vurtual> Azathoth hip-shoting is aimable easily

[1:51] <Malikat> firing from the hip is not intuitive at all
[1:51] <vurtual> I can do it fine :|
[1:52] <Malikat> if you practice with it for a long time maybe you could hit, yeah

[1:52] <vurtual> with an automated crosshair system!
[1:52] <Azathoth> yeah. he's basically got the coordination of a drunk
[1:52] <Azathoth> it's amazing he even hits anything at all
[1:53] <vurtual> they should've at least had him aim at least semi-reliably if you aren't running

[2:03] <vurtual> blaster make them a small image format
[2:04] <blaster> Even then it would be quite large
[2:04] <KodaichiZero> lol
[2:04] <vurtual> 2700 sprites
[2:04] <vurtual> give similar creatures identical sprites
[2:04] <KodaichiZero> best loot ever: Ordinary Scorpion's Heart
[2:04] <KodaichiZero> :/
[2:04] <Lord_Aidan> xD
[2:04] <blaster> Also 728 differnt locations
[2:04] <vurtual> like, blocky sprites
[2:04] <Azathoth> well i mean. you've only got so many base monster types
[2:04] <Azathoth> then they have adjectives
[2:05] <vurtual> store a blocky sprite that has no color, then shade them based on the adjective
[2:05] <Azathoth> yea
[2:05] <blaster> You do know how long the stack of if else if else if else if else if will be right?
[2:05] <vurtual> some could be identical because they might not be visibly different concept
[2:05] <Azathoth> so how does this scratch shit work anyway?
[2:05] <blaster> I have no idea
[2:05] <vurtual> Tiny Skeleton's Food?
[2:05] <blaster> Its quite basic
[2:05] <blaster> Very basic, but I made a cleverbot clone with it
[2:05] <Azathoth> do you just drag little code segments around
[2:05] <KodaichiZero> Teenage Titan
[2:05] <Azathoth> and stuff

[2:07] <Azathoth> yes you do blaster

[2:07] <Azathoth> everyone knows that in RPGs, you don't own any property unless it's on your person
[2:07] <blaster> Well that would be difficult as hell
[2:07] <Lord_Aidan> with random pixels
[2:07] <Lord_Aidan> attacking you

[2:10] <blaster> No idea
[2:10] <vurtual> WHY DO I HAVE COUNTER-STRIKE
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> So if in a RPG
[2:10] <vurtual> did someone gift me counter-strike
[2:10] <blaster> I tried gamemaker 7
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> were going around
[2:10] <Azathoth> that was me, vurtual
[2:10] <Lord_Aidan> And killing monsters
[2:10] <Azathoth> you're welcome

[2:11] <vurtual> cs doesn't
[2:11] <Azathoth> depending on when/which HL you got
[2:11] <vurtual> it's just "purchase", because I preloaded

[2:11] <vurtual> I didn't magically get it but whatever

[2:12] * Azathoth programs a roguelike in assembly
[2:12] <ClassiestMedic> I just blew up a structure maybe 40000 blocks in all with TNT
[2:12] <vurtual> blaster maybe if you used the actual letter values of the names to create the modifiers
[2:12] <ClassiestMedic> My mansion
[2:12] <ClassiestMedic> it was the epicest frigging wtfboom
[2:12] <ClassiestMedic> ever
[2:13] <blaster> vurtual monsters dont have stats
[2:13] <blaster> Only you do
[2:13] <vurtual> for the player
[2:13] <blaster> The 2 skills you have affect the game, speed makes finding monsters quicker, attack makes killing them quicker
[2:13] <ClassiestMedic> Christ, all that's left is a tiny part of the roof
[2:13] <vurtual> so it takes the word "skeleton" and then uses that to see how it should modify your stats using that item
[2:13] <Azathoth> hell, i'm not going to make a roguelike in assembly. i'm going to type it in pure binary
[2:13] <blaster> No
[2:13] <Azathoth> somehow...
[2:13] <KodaichiZero> Epic Wizard's Hide. ewwwwww
[2:14] <blaster> I will make it take the item part
[2:14] <Lord_Aidan> xD
[2:14] <vurtual> I "battled" some queens and got their leggins to remember said "battle"
[2:14] <blaster> it will be a tiny boost

[2:18] <Azathoth> all i know is i want fookin zbrush
[2:19] <vurtual> blaster, not much to add now
[2:19] <LuciferZ> Have you tried the 30 day trial, Azathoth?

[2:20] <vurtual> ooh, add random failure rolls blaster
[2:20] <blaster> Er
[2:20] <vurtual> then intelligence could increase your chance at finding a monster
[2:20] <blaster> what penalty for failing?
[2:20] <Azathoth> death
[2:20] <vurtual> wasting time
[2:20] <LuciferZ> It was pretty cool. I didn't know nothing about 3D modelling but I still managed to make some cool stuff.
[2:20] <blaster> That would make speed overpowered
[2:20] <Azathoth> license is ONLY $595!
[2:21] <Azathoth> actually, that's not as steep as i expected it to be
[2:21] <vurtual> without hgih intelligence you'd fail findin things

[2:29] <Azathoth> um
[2:29] <Azathoth> sounds like python or something
[2:29] <setveen> moo
[2:29] <blaster> Whoops I was reading Cials text while typing that
[2:29] <KodaichiZero> epic shadow
[2:29] <vurtual> The first thing that happens when I go outside is that I'm struck with some game in my head, that does not exist
[2:29] <KodaichiZero> what does it take to make a shadow epic?
[2:29] <Azathoth> where variables don't have to be declared
[2:29] <vurtual> It's like actual graphics and gameplay happening
[2:30] <vurtual> It starts off, you're seeing something happening, a ship floating into a docking bay, then something causes lots of explosions and breaking and the viewpoint is knocked aside and fizzles out
[2:30] <Yourself> <Azathoth> sounds like python or something
[2:30] <Yourself> not really
[2:30] <Yourself> what he said sounds weakly typed
[2:30] <Yourself> python isn't weakly typed
[2:31] <Azathoth> it's not?
[2:31] <vurtual> Then the camera gets up and you're a guy watching a screen and then some hot chick in some suit is like "Sergeant, you've been watching that recording for yours, you okay?" and someone else or she goes "You're not gonna get anything more out of that, trust me."
[2:31] <Azathoth> well i've only used it once. so... get off my dick :\
[2:31] <Yourself> it's not
[2:31] <vurtual> then you're in some control room presumably in space, and someone else is talking with her and at one point you have a pistol that has an alternate-fire mode that lets you aim aroudn on your screen
[2:31] <Yourself> it's not statically typed, either

[2:35] <Yourself> <Azathoth> ok, python uses dynamic typing. i still hate it
[2:35] <Yourself> sucks to be you
[2:35] <Azathoth> what exactly is the benefit of dynamic typing?
[2:36] <Seepia> more generic variables
[2:36] <Yourself> i'm not sure i would really classify it as dynamically typed
[2:36] <Seepia> typecasting one type of var as many diff. types without loss of data
[2:36] <Yourself> but: heterogenous containers
[2:36] <Azathoth> maybe it's just because i couldn't really figure it out. i'm so used to static typing
[2:36] <Seepia> homogenous containers tbh

[2:45] <blaster> No
[2:45] <vurtual> blaster duct-tape
[2:45] <Azathoth> so in python variable types are checked at run time?
[2:45] <blaster> Arn't pythons snakes?
[2:45] <thechris> yup
[2:46] <Azathoth> so if i had a method like "method whatever(a,b) print a + b;" it would work with different variable types?
[2:46] <Yourself> that's not really how python works
[2:46] <thechris> might want to stay clear of those snakes
[2:46] <vede> Azathoth, in Python variables aren't limited to one type, basically. And *everything* happens at runtime.
[2:46] <Azathoth> err yeah. it's not compiled. doh
[2:46] <vede> And, uh, there's no semicolons.
[2:46] * AndrewPH is now known as AndrewPH|AFK
[2:46] <vede> But yeah, basically.
[2:46] <Yourself> it would only work with different variable types if one of the two instances of a or b defined an __add__ or __radd__ method that could operate on the other object
[2:46] <Azathoth> that is interesting
[2:46] * thechris (Mibbit@65.29.110.3) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[2:47] <vede> "print 5+2" would output "7" but "Print 'hey'+' man'" would output "hey man"
[2:47] <Azathoth> well yeah. but i mean i could pass it strings or numbers for instance and it would work
[2:47] <vede> (Or something like that. I haven't used Python for some time.)
[2:47] <vede> Yup.
[2:47] <Yourself> if the types were compatible, yes
[2:47] <blaster> In my Idle RPG should hides increace Attack, Speed, Intelligence or Gold?
[2:47] <Azathoth> interesting
[2:47] <Yourself> you could do it with user defined classes as well
[2:48] <CrazySpai> If anyone would like to have some webspace either for minecraft or even just personal things give me a PM.
[2:48] <Azathoth> as long as they have the appropriate methods
[2:48] <Yourself> yes

[2:48] <Yourself> you can pull off something similar in C++ with templates
[2:48] <blaster> I was thinking of learning blitzmax
[2:49] <Yourself> it's more complicated since you need something that can determine the return type given the two objects
[2:49] <Yourself> it's possible, but weird

[2:59] <vurtual> use coal

[2:59] <KodaichiZero|afk> it makes me not want to quit itr

[3:00] <KodaichiZero|afk> yeah midevil music
[3:00] <Vicrry> I can grow a billion trees :P
[3:00] <Azathoth> i try not to waste coal on smelting as well
[3:00] <vede> Vicrry, if you think coal is limited, your mine isn't big enough.
[3:00] <blaster> I am having to multiply every number in my game by 1000 to get my new feature to work
[3:00] <Azathoth> mainly because i'm paranoid
[3:00] <blaster> Its tedious
[3:00] <Vicrry> Has you seen my mine vede?
[3:00] <vede> It's obviously too small.
[3:00] <Azathoth> i have hundreds of coal, but i'm really stingy about it
[3:01] <Vicrry> and anyway, when trying to smelt six large chests of cobblestone a couple coal ain't enough
[3:01] <vede> Because if you don't want to use coal because there's not enough to go around, ur doin it rong or something like that.

[3:03] <blaster> Thats why you DONT DO THAT
[3:03] <Azathoth> vicrry obviously has a hard time getting wood
[3:03] <Vicrry> lol
[3:03] <vede> Then you're putting more wood on your bridge the wrong way, Vicrry.
[3:03] <blaster> Vicrry wishes he could feel carls wood
[3:03] <Vicrry> I was doing it the lazy way vede :P
[3:04] <Azathoth> also, dam off that water :P
[3:04] <KodaichiZero|afk> jump, move to the side while in midair
[3:04] <Azathoth> i emptied my island map. it's really ugly now
[3:04] <blaster> If you were a dirt block it would be easier to get wood http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Flash/minecraft%20lol.swf
[3:04] <KodaichiZero|afk> easuiest way to bridge build
[3:04] * KodaichiZero|afk is now known as KodaichiZero
[3:04] <vede> Build a one-block dirt bridge across the gorge under where you want the bridge to be, build the full bridge over that bridge. Remove dirt. Safe, and easy!
[3:04] <Vicrry> if you stand on the pixel on the edge you can put a block under your foot

[3:05] <vede> And, uh, if you die when you're doing the 'standard' bridge-building method...
[3:05] <vede> You must not play very much at all.
[3:05] <Vicrry> yeah, I coulda done a scaffolding or something, but I CBA
[3:05] <Azathoth> vede, why build the dirt bridge under it?
[3:06] <blaster> I am going to let my game run for 5 mineuts to check for bugs with the new item bonuses
[3:06] <vede> Azathoth, so you can walk along the dirt bridge.
[3:06] <Vicrry> And also, allergy meds don't really help my hand/eye co-ordination :P
[3:06] <Azathoth> i usually just build in stone or whatever all the way across.
[3:06] <vede> There's no way he could reach that bridge from the floor of the mine.
[3:06] <Azathoth> then i go back and adding sides is easy
[3:06] <Azathoth> oh
[3:06] <Azathoth> you mean building it up from beneath
[3:06] <vede> Exactly.
[3:07] <vede> So if you fell, you're just not worthy of bridge-building.

[3:07] <Azathoth> it looks a little too high for him to get close enough to build it from below
[3:07] <Azathoth> he'd have to build two levels
[3:07] <blaster> If you made the bridge first and then made the pit
[3:07] <Azathoth> maybe 3
[3:07] <Vicrry> Must dig moar mine tho - you can still live if you jump in from the lowest point on the rim
[3:08] <Vicrry> Also must exterminate the pigs, they keep trampling my crops :P
[3:08] <blaster> My new coding works
[3:08] <Azathoth> i see some wasted coal in the side there!
[3:08] <blaster> Time to just finish up the item bonuses
[3:08] <Azathoth> you don't dig out stuff from the side while you're digging down?

[3:09] <Azathoth> do mobs rain down on you, or do oyu just not dig?

[3:14] <Koko|homework> oh actually
[3:14] <Koko|homework> Notch says he fixed the crash bugs
[3:14] <AlexVMiner> :3
[3:14] <Azathoth> one thing i do like about morrowind... i think the items are way more cool than in oblivion

[3:21] <blaster> Wow my inteligence means I get a 0.7% bonus to all XP earned

[3:26] <blaster> But I almost killed my computer trying to add more stuff
[3:26] <blaster> There are no sound effects

[3:26] <blaster> Unless you consider the level up congrats a sound effect

[3:38] <vede> Simple, not really entertaining.
[3:38] <blaster> Nothing I make is
[3:38] <blaster> Thats the problem
[3:38] <blaster> They are experiments
[3:38] <vede> ...
[3:38] <vurtual> anyways now I have a pageful of drawings related to the idea I had earlier
[3:39] <vurtual> and I still have lots left in my mind, undrawn
[3:39] <blaster> Give meh
[3:39] <vede> A car in a track is experimental to you?
[3:39] <blaster> It was a test to see how acceleration and deceleration of an object could work well
[3:39] <vurtual> most of it is unfinished grips(I had a hard time with them)
[3:39] <blaster> The guns?
[3:40] <vurtual> yeah exactly one pistol, and I took up half a paper trying to draw the grip on it
[3:40] <vurtual> basically two faintly curved lines with 4 dots and another line
[3:40] <blaster> http://i41.tinypic.com/53916g.png

[3:41] <vurtual> blaster where did you get that
[3:41] <blaster> Paint
[3:41] <vurtual> what IS that'
[3:41] <blaster> :P
[3:41] <blaster> A gun
[3:41] <FNugget> blaster: on the last level, i reversed through the maze wall. =/
[3:41] <vurtual> I reversed through everything
[3:41] <blaster> I know thats possible
[3:41] <vurtual> blaster you could totally make a car game though
[3:41] <vurtual> multiple cars that can do different things
[3:42] <FNugget> i made a shitty parkour flash game 2 years before mirrors edge

[3:45] <Drewseph_> another use, we can design bridges and such and suddenly cross large gaps withg the click of a mouse

[3:45] * Grass is now known as Cial
[3:45] <blaster> Drew that makes building too easy
[3:45] <Drewseph_> however said bridge will remove however many blocks its made of when you place it
[3:45] <Drewseph_> if you don't have the supplies you can't place the bridge?

[3:47] <Drewseph_> but can be assembled in 30 seconds
[3:47] <blaster> You can find awsome items such as Poor Prisoner's Gold
[3:47] <blaster> No
[3:47] <blaster> I think the only improvement
[3:47] <blaster> would be a option to increce the block placement speed
[3:48] <blaster> with button held down
[3:48] <Drewseph_> wha
[3:48] <Drewseph_> thats already instant
[3:48] <blaster> No
[3:48] <Drewseph_> I can laye like 5 blocks in under a second
[3:48] <blaster> More is needed
[3:48] <blaster> Like 10
[3:48] <blaster> Thats why people use autoclickers
[3:48] <blaster> because its faster than holding
[3:48] <Drewseph_> huh?
[3:48] <FNugget> too bad geocities died, otherwise i can share my old flash adventures
[3:48] <Drewseph_> I just click

[3:49] <blaster> Anyway Drew http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/blaster395/986565 PLAY IT
[3:49] <FNugget> like shooting a fireball spitting giant ventriloquism doll
[3:49] <Drewseph_> I think that an easier way of biloding bridges needs to be done
[3:49] <blaster> It isnt easy in real life
[3:50] <blaster> So it should not be easy in minecraft
[3:50] <Drewseph_> hell even being able to auto build a strip of blocks reaching 5 tiles out would be easier
[3:51] <Drewseph_> Blaster
[3:51] <blaster> yes?
[3:51] <Drewseph_> WTF is this lol
[3:51] <blaster> Its an IDLE rpg
[3:51] <blaster> you don't have to do anything, just let it run and you rack up the points
[3:51] <blaster> I am level 11
[3:51] <FNugget> maybe you can build bridges the easy way roman aquaduct style
[3:51] <Drewseph_> LOL
[3:51] <Drewseph_> this is fun

[3:52] <LuciferZ> If you break up with a girl, very nicely and honestly, and then you start dating someone else a week and a half later, is it reasonable of the ex to believe I left her for the new girl?

[6:27] <vurtual> quake vs ut, the arena is in 3 parts, each team's side is styled to their game and will give them a tactical advantage due to them being used to the level design
[6:28] <vurtual> but for the most part it's symmetrical
[6:28] <vurtual> the middle is a mix of both
[6:28] <outsomnia|Clinton> can we tro halo into dat?

[6:28] <vurtual> halo's not exactly that legendary of a shooter
[6:28] <vurtual> quake's an e-sport nowadays
[6:29] <vurtual> ut's been that game that quake has always been nagged by, the anti-quake
[6:29] <outsomnia|Clinton> lol
[6:29] <vurtual> also weapons for every side from their games, balanced enough so you don't have ut superweapons
[6:29] <vurtual> ut side can have some vehicles I guess, misc stuff like that, nothing too much

[6:30] <Dysgalt> hmm
[6:30] <vurtual> then when you're in the quake base it takes on an industrial metal style and then in the ut side it plays more like whatever ut music is maybe the same I have no idea
[6:31] <vurtual> honestly the most neutral part of me says quake would win unless ut had some really useful weapon

[7:31] <vurtual> so anyone wanting to become a soldier has to watch that "frustration" gif on loop for 4 hours

[7:32] <EmpiresBane> what gif?
[7:32] <vurtual> the one where a girl is using scissors to cut open a shirt they're wearing, without a bra. A very little one that's restraining their breasts
[7:33] <EmpiresBane> that doesn't seem very hard to watch
[7:33] <vurtual> for four hours
[7:33] <vurtual> strapped into a chair
[7:33] <EmpiresBane> still...
[7:33] <vurtual> it'll probably drive anyone crazy
[7:33] <EmpiresBane> the four hours part isn't that bad
[7:33] <vurtual> 4 hours of nothing but the same loop andn othing to think about
[7:33] <Azathoth> when you say strapped to a chair
[7:33] <Azathoth> are your hands bound?
[7:33] <vurtual> yes

[7:34] <vurtual> granted, female soldiers probably wouldn't be affected by it, but then again neither would they be distrated by a one night stand offer.
[7:34] <EmpiresBane> it would be easy
[7:34] <Azathoth> also, do you have a link to this gif? send it in a pm... i'm just curious to see what awful stuff you kids are into these days >_>

[7:47] <vede> Something I really love about indie games is how easy it is to just talk to the developers and toss around ideas with them.
[7:47] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[7:48] <vede> Something I REALLY FUCKING HATE about indie games is the number of people who just are just AGAINST any sort of suggestions AT ALL that involve something being changed. (Note, that's all suggestions that aren't "hey I suggest that this bug be fixed".)
[7:48] <vurtual> I wonder how hard adding a new vehicle weapon&vehicle to jc2 would be
[7:48] <vurtual> I could make a chopper that fires like... nuclear missiles or something
[7:49] <vede> I just went to the Tremulous IRC and suggested that some sort of HUD cues be added so that you know when you're grabbing something or successfully hit something.
[7:49] <Jat> i didnt like tremulous very much
[7:50] <vede> And they said I was stupid for listening to music while playing games, and that I was stupid for not thinking it was obvious enough when you did something.
[7:50] <AndrewPH> python minecraft-server.jar
[7:50] <AndrewPH> derpdederprprpr
[7:51] <vede> I said they were being hostile, and they said they were only hostile to people who came to the channel and shouted about how much the game sucked.
[7:52] <vede> A quote from my encounter: Apr 14 20:55:22 <vede> Okay, something that's also annoyed me when I play as the smaller, quicker aliens, is that I never really know how well I'm doing. I feel like some sort of notification that you've successfully bit/scratched/whatever'd someone would be a very good addition.

[7:54] <Furyhunter> Tremulous is loads of fun for about a few hours with friends, but then it just kind of dies.
[7:55] <vede> I don't think I can really ever have fun with Tremulous again, knowing that the community is full of jerkasses.
[7:57] <EmpiresBane> holy crap!
[7:57] <Konogan|AFK> Vede, play with peoples that aren't jerkasses?

[7:58] <Konogan> About what?
[7:58] <vede> Konogan, it's not that I'd be playing with jerkasses.
[7:58] <Konogan> Then it's not like the community really mant something then.
[7:58] <Konogan> meant*
[7:59] <vede> It's that whenever I play the game, I'll notice the things I thought could be improved, but I'll know they never will be because trying to propose changes means the community would just call you a retard and laugh at you.
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> i told luciferz and shadowdusk to stop their whole argument thing out of the clans

[8:00] <vede> And I'll get frustrated.
[8:00] <Konogan> :\
[8:00] <EmpiresBane> you should suggest it when the developer is there
[8:00] <vede> EmpiresBane, Tremulous is open-source.
[8:00] <EmpiresBane> oh...
[8:01] <vede> And one of the major devs WAS there.
[8:01] <vede> And he did the exact same goddamn thing.
[8:01] <vurtual> make all sorts of ncie changes
[8:01] <vurtual> and compile it
[8:01] <vurtual> and offer it as a rebalanced version
[8:01] <Konogan> ^
[8:01] <vurtual> then, watch them rage about a funner version
[8:01] <vede> Yeah I'd totally do that if I knew how.
[8:01] <vurtual> get the source
[8:02] <vurtual> test-compile source
[8:02] <vurtual> modify source how you want it
[8:02] <Konogan> Vede, trial and error.
[8:02] <vurtual> compile, offer modified source as a better one
[8:02] <vurtual> or well, alternative
[8:02] <vurtual> then, create binaries and debs and stuff
[8:02] <vurtual> the only way it can be funnier is if they're like 10 year old girls, and gossip to get at you
[8:02] <vede> All they'd do is complain about how I changed it at all and call me a retard for making the game less hardcore.
[8:03] <vurtual> and?
[8:03] <vurtual> You'd get fans.
[8:03] <vurtual> You'd outdo them
[8:03] <vurtual> the devs would quit
[8:03] <vurtual> you'd be the dev.
[8:03] <vede> "WASSAT? You made it so you don't have to have full silence to play the game well? TOO CASUAL FUCK YOU GO AWAY LITTLE PUSSY BABY"
[8:03] <KodaichiZero> WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
[8:03] <EmpiresBane> you would make it pay-2-play game
[8:03] <EmpiresBane> you make money
[8:03] <KodaichiZero> I do not approve of this

[8:04] <vurtual> quick someone name some hl2/hl1 mods I should try
[8:04] <Konogan> natural selection?
[8:04] <Konogan> XD
[8:04] <KodaichiZero> durrr CSS?
[8:04] <vede> It's like that openBSD fiasco where some guy made what was basically an openBSD GUI liveCD and the openBSD was all up in arms because it was too easy to use.
[8:04] <vurtual> css isn't a mod
[8:04] <vurtual> the original cs was but meh
[8:05] <vurtual> Never actually tried natural selection out of some fear of creepiness, although that's never stopped me from playing a game before.
[8:05] <vede> *openBSD community was
[8:05] <KodaichiZero> why
[8:05] <vurtual> maybe it's fear of water creatures
[8:05] <KodaichiZero> why ask for hl2 mods
[8:05] <KodaichiZero> what's the point man
[8:05] <Konogan> Vurtual, go play penumbra if you want something creepy :D

[8:05] <vurtual> I've played loads of hl/hl2 mods so I've run out of ideas

[8:06] <vurtual> vede, the ones without attacking
[8:06] <Konogan> Vede, the first time you play it is >_<
[8:06] <Konogan> Yup
[8:06] <Konogan> tech demo
[8:06] <vede> Yeah, the first time I played I was scared shitless.
[8:06] <vurtual> it's something funny when game players will always invent a way to kill things if you even remotely give them a way
[8:06] <vurtual> Yay for being human.
[8:06] <vurtual> "The player has no way to actually fight still, right? Just throwing stuff, right?" "Yeah it should be fine."
[8:07] <vurtual> Suddenly, people realise that bashing things with rocks is a valid strategy
[8:07] <vede> But after my first few plays, I realized that ALL the scares were death scares (that is, they scare you, you die, then you avoid them after reloading).
[8:07] <Konogan> Yeah, and is it me or the third one was bullshit?
[8:07] <vede> I was just kinda dancing through the dark underground mines whistling and being merry.

[8:07] <vurtual> really scary
[8:08] <vurtual> way back
[8:08] <vurtual> half-life
[8:08] <Konogan> What?
[8:08] <vede> "Oh look. A dark hole in the wall! I should jump in! YAY!"
[8:08] <vede> Really, Penumbra was less about actually being scary than it was about saving and loading.
[8:08] <vurtual> half-life 2, an atmospheric adventure
[8:09] <Konogan> Vurtual, way back, my soul was consumed by fear when I played Doom64...
[8:09] <vurtual> less guns and more scary
[8:09] <vurtual> Konogan ichthyosaurs
[8:09] <Konogan> >_<
[8:09] <EmpiresBane> the half-life games are the only games that have ever scared me
[8:09] <vurtual> I still, to this day, have a huge amount of fear when jumping into water in hl

[8:10] <vurtual> NO WAIT THIS TIME MANHACKS
[8:10] <vurtual> no wait this time a barnacle
[8:10] <Konogan> Well, Half-life wasn't that bad for me. Does movies count? Because I got traumas from watching "The Thing"...
[8:10] <EmpiresBane> then you hear a headcrab and suddenly your screen is flashing red
[8:10] <vurtual> a wall-barnacle that has a big mouth of teeth that lightly twitches
[8:10] <vurtual> also your flashlight is dead until you come near it
[8:10] <EmpiresBane> half-life is scary when you have like 5 health

[8:16] <vurtual> what was it about
[8:16] <vurtual> I remember lots of people I know playing it once
[8:16] <Konogan> It's a mod for HL2.
[8:16] <Konogan> A party of specops trying to kill an invisible predator.
[8:17] <Konogan> Really creepy.
[8:17] <Konogan> Well, it's not a predator like in the movie.
[8:17] <Konogan> more like a failed genetic experiment.
[8:17] <Konogan> But whatever.
[8:17] <vurtual> oh yeah
[8:17] <vurtual> I don't like scary games generally
[8:18] <Konogan> Try it, It's not that scary.
[8:18] <vurtual> either just annoying me with their fear tactics or the one in a million scary games
[8:18] <vurtual> Also I have sharp senses so it'd probably be boring
[8:18] <Konogan> Try and you'll see.
[8:18] <vurtual> if the invisible thing even breathes or farts in my general direction and I'll pick it up with surround sound
[8:18] <vurtual> So I'd either be bored, or creeped out.
[8:19] <Konogan> Well, if you put it like that, creeped.

[8:24] <Konogan> They're bad?
[8:24] <vurtual> it was teamplay and lots were on the same team
[8:24] <EmpiresBane> vurtual, you have way too much time
[8:24] <vurtual> some pretty good players but nobody could hit someone who was always flying accross their screens
[8:25] <vurtual> nobody had any points because the map was evenly spread enough that nobody could get into fights long enough to score before I blew them to shreds from a distance
[8:25] <Konogan> It doesn't happen like that when I play...
[8:25] <Subculture> The only game that scares me is Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl, the only game that can scare me in broad daylight.
[8:25] <vurtual> also the map started you off with weapons
[8:25] <vurtual> and had enough gauss ammo that I could keep up a supply
[8:26] <vurtual> on the other hand players had 2/3rds of the weapons or more and none of them had any way of shooting me
[8:26] <Konogan> Vurtual, they're bad.
[8:27] <vurtual> it was a server full of pros
[8:27] <Konogan> How do you know?
[8:27] <vurtual> later all the good players learned to do it
[8:27] <vurtual> those who survived that massive 1-against-all fight
[8:27] <vurtual> and the last time the server was up, it was FULL of gauss jumps
[8:27] <vurtual> lasers

[8:30] <EmpiresBane> god, i take forever to do stuff
[8:30] <vurtual> now what to do for 44 minutes
[8:31] <Konogan> Vurtual, bake a pretty cake.
[8:31] <vurtual> no
[8:31] <Marafk> delicious and moist one
[8:31] <vurtual> Marafk
[8:31] <vurtual> how interactive are environments in ut
[8:31] * Marafk is now known as Marach
[8:31] <vurtual> like, player ability to directly change the game world
[8:31] <Konogan> UT?
[8:31] <vurtual> breakable things
[8:31] <Marach> depends on the map
[8:31] <vurtual> in general?
[8:31] <vurtual> ctf maps
[8:32] <Marach> there's one with a death chamber. when a button outside is pressed, everyone inside dies :D
[8:32] <Marach> of course there are a lot of powerups inside
[8:32] <Toaster-Lunchbox> vurtual, make me a sammich
[8:32] <Splatticus> Wat are you guys blabbering about.
[8:32] <vurtual> go make it yourself

[8:33] <Konogan> Splat*
[8:33] <vurtual> I mean like random breakable stuff and such Marach
[8:33] <Marach> no breakable afaik
[8:33] <vurtual> ok
[8:33] <Konogan> Vurtual, Go play Red Faction: Guerilla.
[8:33] <Splatticus> Leonidas is not a relevant answer to my query.
[8:33] <vurtual> I don't have that!
[8:33] <Splatticus> RFG is fucking delicious.
[8:33] <Splatticus> I highly suggest it.
[8:33] <Konogan> Get it.
[8:34] <vurtual> how
[8:34] <Splatticus> I mean come on your melee weapon is a fucking sledgehammer.
[8:34] <Splatticus> Steam.
[8:34] <Marach> vurtual: keep talking about how you're bored, refusing each offer to do something
[8:34] <vurtual> ...and by then the download for the hidden would be done
[8:34] <vurtual> and it'd SLOW the download
[8:34] <Konogan> Watch me livestream some gothic 3?
[8:34] <Konogan> NVM.
[8:35] <vurtual> that'd also slow it
[8:35] <vurtual> a little
[8:35] <Konogan> it's like 0:34 here :P
[8:35] <Konogan> Need to go rest.
[8:35] <Marach> i see vurtual listened to me :D
[8:35] <EmpiresBane> vurtual, do you have a cat?
[8:35] <Konogan> Well.
[8:35] <vurtual> If there was a game which was ctf, and one side was quake and the other ut, with their game's weapons available in their side, and their third of the map being styled to their game(so quake players would be used to playing on their third), and the middle be a mix
[8:35] <vurtual> who would win
[8:35] <Konogan> nvm.
[8:35] <Splatticus> Is it just me or has the procedural generation gotten less creative?
[8:35] <vurtual> no dogs and they are outside
[8:35] <EmpiresBane> go down to the pound and get a kitty
[8:35] <vurtual> and the ut side may or may not have some vehicles but they wouldn't be amazingly useful
[8:36] <vurtual> my cat ran away EmpiresBane
[8:36] <vurtual> I'm still waiting for it to come back again
[8:36] <Marach> not useful vehicles? :O
[8:36] <vurtual> before that our first cat suffered some mysterious problem and died writhing on the floor
[8:36] <Splatticus> Vurt, is that little helicopter thing available to the UT guys?
[8:36] <Konogan> The quake side could have vehicle too.
[8:36] <Marach> i dont know any
[8:36] <KodaichiZero> here's what I was planning on greeting you all with: "im bored, let's cyber"
[8:36] <vurtual> marach they couldn't tank around in the quake side
[8:36] <vurtual> quake doesn't have vehicles
[8:36] <KodaichiZero> i decided not to
[8:36] <Marach> take something flying
[8:36] <Konogan> QuakeWar.
[8:36] <Splatticus> If the UT guys have the hover thing, UT guys would dominate.
[8:36] <vurtual> q3a in specific
[8:36] <vurtual> splatticus does it have auto-targetting guns
[8:37] <Marach> no
[8:37] <vurtual> then rocketjump would beat you
[8:37] <Marach> only rockets :D
[8:37] <Marach> you have to aim guns yourself
[8:37] * Bomb_Spammer|shower is now known as Bomb_Spammer|
[8:37] * Bomb_Spammer| is now known as Bomb_Spammer
[8:37] <Splatticus> It has a speed-surge, and like this hoverslam type deal that makes chopping up enemies a breeze. UT guys would win.
[8:37] <Konogan> ok, then it should be Q3A VS UT: GOTY.
[8:37] <vurtual> also, our other cat had some mysterious lump at one point when it was in my sister's care, she decided to wait a long time to take care of it
[8:37] <vurtual> roughly before then the cat died
[8:37] <vurtual> Splatticus, quake players have the rocket launcher
[8:37] <vurtual> remember the quake live rocketjump training?
[8:38] <Konogan> Lol.
[8:38] <Marach> ah. you instantly kill players by ramming into them
[8:38] <Splatticus> Everyone and their dog in FPS has rocket launchers.
[8:38] <vurtual> quake live players find that very easy
[8:38] <vurtual> simeltaneously, there's a mild goings-around stereotype that q3 players are a bit better
[8:38] <Splatticus> When Splatticus kills by ramming, he becomes...
[8:38] * Splatticus is now known as Splattercaust
[8:38] <Marach> rocketjumping isnt very useful in ut, too much damage
[8:39] <outsomnia|Clinton> yay for walljumps?
[8:39] <Konogan> UT have nukes though.
[8:39] <vurtual> the quake side has their quake guns
[8:39] <outsomnia|Clinton> nooks r gud 2
[8:39] <vurtual> At least a few basics like the rocket launcher, railgun, plasma gun, lightning gun, and shotgun
[8:39] <Splattercaust> The nukes are pretty badass for fly-by-wire.
[8:39] <vurtual> shaft would rape most everything
[8:39] <Splattercaust> Vurt..
[8:39] <Splattercaust> UT has all of those? Rofl.
[8:40] <vurtual> they're different guns though
[8:40] <Splattercaust> Same concept.
[8:40] <vurtual> okay is the lighning gun in ut
[8:40] <Konogan> Vurtual, Rocket launcher? No. It's the Rocket Gun.
[8:40] <vurtual> an energy beam
[8:40] <Toaster-Lunchbox> vurtual, suck mah ballz
[8:40] <vurtual> that has infinite range
[8:40] <vurtual> well alot of range
[8:40] <vurtual> and high dps
[8:40] <Konogan> High DPH.
[8:40] <Splattercaust> UT's lightning gun's alt fire + normal fire combo clears rooms like The Punisher.
[8:40] <vurtual> as a consistent beam

[8:42] <Splattercaust> No it isn't. :l
[8:42] <Konogan> Yes.

[8:42] <Konogan> Not Lightning gun.
[8:42] <Splattercaust> ...
[8:43] <Konogan> We're all wrong. Happy now?
[8:43] <Splattercaust> I was comparing UT vs Quake weapons.
[8:43] <Splattercaust> Shock Rifle is UT's lightning gun.
[8:43] <Marach> "Tomorrow, I???ll figure out why the mobs won???t spawn online"
[8:43] <Splattercaust> Stfu.

[8:43] <Splattercaust> Yes, Maracv.
[8:43] <Splattercaust> Godly, is it not?

[8:43] <Splattercaust> Piss your pants now.
[8:43] <KodaichiZero> Marach: what

[8:43] <Konogan> Vurtual, Bunnyhoping :D
[8:43] <KodaichiZero> oh
[8:43] <Marach> ?
[8:44] <KodaichiZero> i didn't
[8:44] <vurtual> none really
[8:44] <Splattercaust> Marach, he gets it to work on his local system, but not on the web version. That's what he meant by online.
[8:44] <Marach> i know!
[8:44] <vurtual> also what other guns would the quake guys get
[8:44] <Marach> that's why i said "almost"
[8:44] <vurtual> if they had team arena powerups that'd be kinda scary
[8:44] <EmpiresBane> and "first thought"
[8:44] <Splattercaust> Hey vurt.
[8:44] <Splattercaust> You're going to piss yourself.
[8:45] <Splattercaust> But..
[8:45] <Splattercaust> Uh..
[8:45] <Marach> ...
[8:45] <KodaichiZero> It's not like he actually has a working multiplayer prototype and is planning on releasing it for testing soon, or something

[8:45] <vurtual> you can add me if you want and then we could play together later
[8:45] <Splattercaust> I would lag to fuck.
[8:45] <Marach> there's nothing you can pay for >_>

[8:46] <Splattercaust> Sry, but it doesn't matter.
[8:46] <vurtual> it has matchmaking so it'll find decent pings and players who aren't that better than you
[8:46] <Splattercaust> The nearest major hub.
[8:46] <vurtual> including whatever you were talking about
[8:46] <Splattercaust> Is Anchorage.

[8:47] <mail2345> i return to turn on my gas tank
[8:47] <KodaichiZero> aww damn
[8:47] <KodaichiZero> that sounds shitty
[8:47] <mail2345> but
[8:47] <vurtual> mail2345 did you figure out how to do teh sciences yet
[8:47] <Splattercaust> Oh god, isn't that like on byond?
[8:47] <mail2345> not in time
[8:47] <vurtual> turn people into monkey
[8:47] <mail2345> @vurtual no
[8:47] <vurtual> figure it out then
[8:47] <vede> Corporations' control over the computing industry makes me cry.
[8:47] <mail2345> hrm
[8:47] <Konogan> I alway wanted to try SS13, but I couldn't understand how to play. :P
[8:47] <mail2345> are people okay
[8:48] <mail2345> with random monky killing?
[8:48] <vede> And it makes me angry.
[8:48] <mail2345> knocking them out
[8:48] <mail2345> just general animal cruelty
[8:48] <vurtual> anyways guys while Splattercaust tries to play quake i'm gonna go play quake
[8:48] <vurtual> then contemplate weapons
[8:48] <Splattercaust> o_O
[8:48] <Splattercaust> I'm playing Minecraft, buddy.
[8:48] <Konogan> That's what we should all do.
[8:49] <EmpiresBane> should "controls and settings" be before "game modes"?
[8:49] <Konogan> No.
[8:49] <Konogan> Settings alway last just before exit.
[8:49] <EmpiresBane> yeah... the more i thought about it, the less it made sense
[8:49] <Dysgalt> ugh I hate mic spammers
[8:50] <EmpiresBane> no no no. this is for the minecraft tutorial i'm making
[8:50] <KodaichiZero> im gonna play some QUAKE LIVE
[8:50] <KodaichiZero> BORYEH
[8:50] <vurtual> also what would the bases for each side in this quake/ut thing be styled after, map-wise?
[8:50] <vurtual> like, any ideas from any of you for specific maps
[8:51] <Konogan> EmpiresBane, It needs a tutorial? It's pretty straightforward afterall...
[8:51] <EmpiresBane> how long have you been here?
[8:51] <Konogan> Too much time I'm afraid.
[8:52] <vede> Ubuntu apparently including Yahoo as its default search function... Nexuiz being blatantly fucking stolen by a company so they can make a console version, and also so they can shit in the face of the GPL and the entirety of the free software movement.
[8:52] <Splattercaust> UT would be open outside imho. Quake seems like they're close-quarter hallways types, so maybe they're inside a building in a cliff face.
[8:52] <EmpiresBane> well, you should've noticed by now, too many people have a hard time.

[8:54] <EmpiresBane> i have no idea about the vanilla thing
[8:54] <vurtual> Splattercaust more like a specific map
[8:54] <Splattercaust> ?
[8:54] <Konogan> Kodai, I think it's the same thing...
[8:54] <vurtual> say maybe have actual arenas from the game turned into the bases
[8:54] <vurtual> then a middleground
[8:55] <vurtual> and either an opening or portals or both connecting the two
[8:55] * Splattercaust F11s to block you guys out, lols.
[8:55] <Konogan> Empires, That would be a tutorial on "How to read."
[8:55] <vurtual> I could at least see campgrounds or forgotten place becoming whole huge flag holders
[8:55] <Konogan> No.
[8:55] <Konogan> NVM that.

[9:17] <Malikat> hello Tommerry11
[9:17] <Tommerry11> how come your livestream is so popular?
[9:18] <Malikat> notch linked it on his blog once
[9:18] <Malikat> at one point i had ~90 viewers
[9:18] <Tommerry11> oh, right. cool. im off to do more live stuff. not that anyone watches anyway.
[9:19] <Malikat> what stuff do you do on a stream?
[9:20] <Tommerry11> minecraft.
[9:20] <Malikat> if you want viewers, you could stream on malicraft sometime
[9:20] <Tommerry11> how do you view chat while playing? the text just keeps overrighting itself. also, AWESOME, you would let me do that???
[9:22] * Dae is now known as ZzZ|Dae
[9:22] <Malikat> i never use the hud in game

[9:22] <Malikat> i leave procaster open either on another monitor or next to the firefox window
[9:22] <Malikat> procaster has a good chat.
[9:22] <vurtual> ooh have q and e be rotational
[9:23] <vurtual> rotate around in 0G and walk on walls
[9:23] <Tommerry11> yea, i use that.
[9:23] <vurtual> fall over onto your side!
[9:23] <Tommerry11> vurt. that would be sweet.
[9:23] <Tommerry11> shift, but in minecraft.
[9:24] <vurtual> craft most things like now except using random scrap parts
[9:24] <vurtual> so you could create electromagnetic boots
[9:24] <Toaster-Lunchbox> ballmen is a fun source mod
[9:24] <vurtual> and walk on any surface
[9:24] <Tommerry11> cool, and gravity on cubes?
[9:24] <vurtual> that you can send yourself to
[9:24] <vurtual> and gravity sources that maybe use connected blocks to create gravitational range
[9:25] <vurtual> a simple black hole style thing could be made from very dense materials
[9:25] <Tommerry11> tactical space minecraft?
[9:25] <vurtual> if you had ships, you could create repulsorlifts for use in gravity, or just fly around normally
[9:25] <Dysgalt> uhm never cover a bank in tnt
[9:25] <Toaster-Lunchbox> Dysgalt, wh- OH GOD
[9:26] <vurtual> also maybe if ship building was an aspect you could have people building simple no-atmosphere ships that have to mount in to fly

[9:28] <vurtual> with things like using Q and E to roll
[9:28] <Cubex> mc in space?
[9:28] <Cubex> sounds epic
[9:28] <vurtual> sci-fi related gear
[9:29] <Yourself> the correct answer was no
[9:29] <vurtual> weapons and armor made from scraps added with various things like metals
[9:29] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.70.169) has joined #minecraft
[9:29] <vurtual> Yourself you are the only person to complain so far
[9:29] <gear> stop saying gear
[9:29] <vurtual> I could totally try and make minecraft in C with a sci-fi theme just to see what ntoch would say
[9:29] <vurtual> change your name/highlights gear
[9:29] <Tommerry11> i think its a awesome idea, although hard to make gravity like that.
[9:29] <gear> i cant on this client
[9:29] <Yourself> because basing construction on a rectangular array of blocks for spacecraft just seems silly
[9:29] <vurtual> I can only imagine what fsx discussions would be like
[9:30] <gear> i dont really care though
[9:30] <vurtual> go use mirc or something
[9:30] <Yourself> you could easily come up with something based on modules coupling together
[9:30] <vurtual> blocks
[9:30] <vurtual> POLYGONS
[9:30] <Yourself> in fact there was a flash game like that
[9:30] <vurtual> you know how like in starfox on the snes
[9:30] <chibifs> Man I was playing wow a few years ago and totally had some epic gear.
[9:30] <Cubex> sounds good, im making a game too
[9:31] <chibifs> My favorite video game console is game gear
[9:31] <vurtual> some basic textures you could apply to internals and externals

[9:31] <Yourself> what was your weight?
[9:32] <chibifs> My friend likeds to play that one game, gear of war or something
[9:32] <Cubex> oh i must go to school :/
[9:32] <Tommerry11> well aslong as you had 0g, it would be preety easy, but view would be hard.
[9:32] * Cubex (Mibbit@90.83-213-240.dynamic.clientes.euskaltel.es) has left #minecraft
[9:32] <vurtual> basically here's a way you could do it
[9:32] <vurtual> players could try to forc themselves to roll using Q and E
[9:33] <vurtual> then if you had equipment like space jets(default in creative), Q and E would let you rocket-roll
[9:33] <vurtual> or rocket yoruself into rolling onto your side
[9:33] * Cial (fatalbert_@209-42-180-41.wispnet.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:33] <AndrewPH> accidentally the entire rocket
[9:33] <vurtual> and holding both would slow you down, tapping both would lock you to 90 deg position
[9:33] <KodaichiZero> so
[9:33] <KodaichiZero> I'm gonna try quake live soon
[9:33] <vurtual> ok KodaichiZero want some advice
[9:34] * Dysgalt is now known as Dys-Sleep
[9:34] <KodaichiZero> is there sanything I must know before I do?
[9:34] <chibifs> I have this awesome 4 gear bicycle. I like to ride it around.
[9:34] <vurtual> rocket their feet
[9:34] <Tommerry11> but you would have 360 vertical movement, as in when you looked up, your hole body would move.
[9:34] <KodaichiZero> okay, that's standard
[9:34] <KodaichiZero> what else
[9:34] <chibifs> I also have a swiss gear backpack. It had a cool tube light in it. It rocks!
[9:34] <vurtual> lightning gun is powerful
[9:34] <vurtual> don't waste ammo with it and just keep holding it on them, release when you're not really hitting them
[9:34] <Yourself> i wish i could find that damn flash game
[9:34] <vurtual> Tommerry11, maybe only when you look up far enough/rotate far enough
[9:35] <Tommerry11> Kodaichi, its VERY addictive. i cant play cause of sattalite broadband, but even bots can ceep me going for hours.
[9:35] <vurtual> then it'd try to do yaw/pitch
[9:35] <vurtual> also gauntlet is powerful(melee)
[9:35] <Tommerry11> yea, suppose so.
[9:35] <KodaichiZero> what about the "Rail Gun", I hear it's pretty good?
[9:35] <vurtual> railgun's pretty lame if you're new
[9:35] <vurtual> or aren't good at hitting
[9:35] <Tommerry11> its good. if you can aim.
[9:35] <KodaichiZero> I'm okay at most fps games.
[9:35] <vurtual> can take 2 hits to kill with sometimes
[9:35] <Tommerry11> noob toobs the best though, for me.
[9:36] <vurtual> ...noob toob?
[9:36] <vurtual> this isn't mw2
[9:36] <AndrewPH> youporn.com
[9:36] <vurtual> or cs
[9:36] <Tommerry11> lol, its called the same.
[9:36] <Tommerry11> in quake.
[9:36] <gear> so
[9:36] <vurtual> gl?
[9:36] <chibifs> This is my swiss gear backpack. http://www.amazon.com/Swiss-Gear-Rosa-Illuminated-Sling/dp/B000EU10JQ It's the best.
[9:36] <gear> my friend becky messaged me
[9:36] <vurtual> also KodaichiZero just jump repeatedly for fast
[9:36] <vurtual> follow the whole "grab some stuff and fight" methodology
[9:36] <Tommerry11> strafe is betta.
[9:36] <vurtual> and remember that plasma gun is very useful
[9:37] <gear> and its a bunch of girls trying to troll me using her screen name
[9:37] <vurtual> Tommerry11 yeah but that's not very easy to do
[9:37] <vurtual> or that important
[9:37] <KodaichiZero> okie
[9:37] <gear> and one of them nearby sold them out
[9:37] <gear> and told me what was going on
[9:37] <gear> so COUNTER TROLL ACTIVATE
[9:37] <vurtual> also popular arenas are campgrounds(nice and balanced)
[9:37] <Tommerry11> actually, its good.
[9:37] <vurtual> forgotten place is a nice arena too imo
[9:37] <vurtual> and dreadwerkz can be popular but the bfg camping will sometimes rersult in
[9:38] <Tommerry11> the vert maps are the best.
[9:38] <vurtual> horrible players running into the bfg10k room and dying instantly due to a smart player
[9:38] <vurtual> and and then even good players can't compete
[9:38] <Yourself> http://www.captainforever.com/captainforever.php
[9:38] <Yourself> there it is
[9:38] <Yourself> that's the game
[9:38] <vurtual> the weapons you should first master are the shotgun, plasma gun, lightning gun(shaft), and of course rocket launcher
[9:39] <Tommerry11> lolz, i went to a friends house and played, got 6th out of 16 ( i think...) on first match ever.

[12:05] <Splattercaust> Only creative has multiplayer atm.
[12:05] <vurtual> or blue-producing flowers

[13:56] <Griskard> Hey Notch, have you thought of hosting a MP server when Infdev comes out, and charging a subscription to play on YOUR server?
[13:56] <Yohanu> mmo's being the prime example
[13:56] <Yohanu> it's so funny to see the graphs of new mmo's
[13:57] <Yohanu> first month: 800k players
[13:57] <vurtual> so I need a way to search for every instance of either of these words: "power" or "veins", in the entire nethack source
[13:57] <Yohanu> second month: 50k players
[13:57] <Nuky> Haha, yeah, Yohanu.
[13:58] <Yohanu> i have an interesting mmo-idea i intend to pursue though!
[13:58] <Yohanu> something that has not been done before :D
[13:58] <Nuky> Ey, why is my place suddenly CRAWLING with animals? D=
[13:58] <Nuky> Do tell, Yohanu.
[13:58] <Nuky> I'll be sure not to steal the idea ;)
[13:59] <Notch> Should I steal the block climbing idea from that kube game thing? =D
[14:00] <Nuky> If it adds positively to your game, by all means, steal steal steal =)
[14:00] <Notch> do you think it would?
[14:00] <Yohanu> Nuky, imagine zelda : a link to the past styled game, but with mouse controlled combat
[14:00] <Nuky> "Should I steal the shooting from half life?" =)
[14:00] <Nuky> No idea how that works, Notch
[14:00] <Nuky> And, Yohanu, kind of like aiming in a top-down shooter?
[14:00] <Yohanu> yep Nuky
[14:00] <Yohanu> primarily focused on melee combat
[14:01] <Notch> if you walk towards a 1 block high obstacle, you'll climb up on it automatically
[14:01] <Nuky> Awesome. I love top down aiming.
[14:01] <Yohanu> but with archery etc
[14:01] <Nuky> Hmm.
[14:01] <vurtual> no Notch
[14:01] <Yohanu> for instance
[14:01] <Nuky> Not sure about that, mr. Notch =)
[14:01] <vurtual> Maybe if you jump you push up and get a much more fluid movement?
[14:01] <Yohanu> different melee weapons have different speeds/hit arcs
[14:01] <Yohanu> so it would be pixel-perfect combat
[14:01] <Yohanu> :P
[14:02] <Notch> how about megaman jumping, where you jump higher the longer you press the jump key?
[14:02] <Nuky> =)
[14:02] <vurtual> all melee should be like half-life crowbar fights
[14:02] <vurtual> but with more weapons potentially
[14:02] <Nuky> Two-meter jumps? D=
[14:02] <chibifs> Notch, if you do add in auto climbing, make sure it's slow.
[14:02] <vurtual> wait what is this for notch, minecraft
[14:02] <vurtual> 2m jumps are dangerous
[14:02] <Yohanu> Notch jumpman jumping!
[14:02] <Notch> minecraft
[14:02] <Notch> and no 2m jumps
[14:02] <vurtual> 1m and a half?
[14:02] <Nuky> Phew. Tiny jumps are fine, I suppose?
[14:02] <Notch> i thought with megaman type jumps, you might feel more in control :D
[14:03] * Gibri (eia234@tgad31.rhi.hi.is) has joined #minecraft
[14:03] <Nuky> Now, Yohanu, I'm not much of a MMO-player myself, but, how would that work online?
[14:03] <Yohanu> it might feel a bit odd in an fps-camera game though Notch
[14:03] <Notch> aye
[14:03] <Yohanu> it would work fine Nuky
[14:03] <vurtual> crouch jumping!
[14:03] <Nuky> Crouching? D=
[14:04] <Nuky> Crawling would change the game a lot. =)
[14:04] <Nuky> At least if the caves were to return
[14:04] <chibifs> Crawling would be really cool if it slowed you down, too.
[14:04] <vurtual> since 1-block holes were meant to be unenterable, have all the crouchign and stuff be in half-blocks worth
[14:04] <Nuky> Notch, what have you done to my level?! There's a bajillion animals!
[14:04] <Yohanu> owned!
[14:05] <Notch> yeah, sorry about that. :D
[14:05] <Yohanu> see it as a challenge
[14:05] <Yohanu> :)
[14:05] <Nuky> =P
[14:05] <Notch> there's NO balancing in the spawner at the moment, haha
[14:05] <Nuky> brb, cat's going weird.
[14:05] <sppt> hey notch :)
[14:05] <Notch> hey =)
[14:05] <Yohanu> perhaps you could add a personal spawn system for creative mode Notch
[14:06] <Yohanu> eg, place a "spawner" (visual respresentation of spawn point), allow a person to add mobs into it, spawn count, respawn timer
[14:06] <Yohanu> etc
[14:06] <Yohanu> could be a quite interesting addition
[14:06] <vurtual> or pet mobs that work like pikachu did in pokemon yellow
[14:06] <vurtual> so you have a sheep that follows you
[14:06] <chibifs> OH GOD. OVER 9000 SHEEP.
[14:07] <vurtual> it's like that stalker crow bug!
[14:07] <sppt> Yohanu, roadburn starts today :)
[14:07] <Notch> actually, there should just be like 50 sheep and pigs. ;D
[14:07] <Yohanu> cool
[14:07] <sppt> i heard earthless' guitarist might play with oresund space collective
[14:08] <sppt> so that's an epic improv guitarist + improv band = major win
[14:08] <Yohanu> lol
[14:08] <sppt> holy shit notch, 4 displays? really?
[14:09] <Notch> yes =D
[14:09] <sppt> dayum
[14:09] <Notch> only two work, though, I need active adapter cables
[14:09] <sppt> why 4? haha
[14:09] <Notch> and nobody sells them
[14:09] <Furious_III> So
[14:09] <Foshie> Wait, Monsters / Sheeps / pigs now?
[14:09] <Yohanu> because 4 monitors is leet
[14:09] <Notch> because I want a kick-ass home office :D
[14:09] <Furious_III> I'm minutes away from buying the game.
[14:09] <Nuky> matrox adapter, Notch?
[14:09] <Notch> no, radeon eyefinity
[14:09] <vurtual> so anyone know a simple program that can search a folder's contents for text, ubuntu 9.04
[14:09] <Furious_III> I just need someone to pitch it a little more
[14:09] <Nuky> Ohs.
[14:09] <Notch> i don't trust matrox
[14:09] <TG_Weaver> Notch this is awesome
[14:09] <Yohanu> lol
[14:10] <TG_Weaver> I love monsters everywhere
[14:10] <Notch> but with matrox, it'd work
[14:10] <Yohanu> my matrox g200 was trust
[14:10] <Yohanu> y
[14:10] <sppt> i can technically connect 6 to my 2 HD5850s, and use eyefinity to get an insane res, but it's not really cheap :P
[14:10] <vurtual> also what os are you running Notch
[14:10] <Yohanu> back in 1997!

[14:10] <Notch> I changed it
[14:10] <Yohanu> cus the win7 taskbar sucks
[14:10] <vurtual> how did ou do this
[14:10] <Fractal> I have found a way to spawn lava in infdev (no cheats)
[14:10] <Nuky> Oh, right, no fluid physics. <_< *has a big hole in the water.*
[14:10] <sppt> notch, what radeon card(s) do you have?
[14:10] <vurtual> woah people who AGREE WITH ME on that taskbar
[14:11] <Yohanu> yeah there are few of us vurtual
[14:11] <Fractal> make sand above open lava, and it turns into lava!
[14:11] <Notch> HD 5870 by Sapphire
[14:11] <Fractal> potential for traps, oh yes
[14:11] <sppt> ah nice
[14:11] <sppt> the hd5800 cards are really nice
[14:11] <Notch> yeah, it's running really well =D
[14:11] <chibifs> AHHH! @_@ Skeleton in my boat
[14:11] <sppt> Yohanu, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5zntaS0kzM&feature=related
[14:11] <Notch> occlusion culling in minecraft doesn't work, though
[14:12] <sppt> Notch, i got an i7 with 2 hd5850's. This machine's a beast! :P
[14:12] <Fractal> notch, bug or feature? (sand turning into lava)
[14:12] <Notch> bug!
[14:12] <Fractal> aww
[14:12] <Yohanu> interesting sppt
[14:12] <sppt> yeah, it is really nice
[14:12] <Fractal> but I can make a room turn into lava at the flick of a torch :(
[14:12] <sppt> definitely gonna see them
[14:13] <Yohanu> i prefer more 70's hard rock elements though sppt
[14:13] <Nuky> Yo, Notch, will there be a way to set spawn points in infdev? Like, build a throne or somehting?
[14:13] <sppt> btw Yohanu i heard people had to cancel their flights due to a volcanic eruption
[14:13] <Yohanu> sppt http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqgmgBazJ-8
[14:13] <sppt> that's really bad :((
[14:13] <Yohanu> similar but with more 70's hard rock
[14:13] <Yohanu> well, maybe that song isn't particularily similar
[14:13] <Yohanu> but they do have similar ones
[14:13] <Nuky> It's quite a long swim to shore, you see =P
[14:13] <|404notfound> hrm
[14:14] <|404notfound> at this point, is there anything in indev that isn't in infdev?
[14:14] <Nuky> Water physics
[14:14] <Nuky> Caves
[14:14] <Nuky> =)
[14:14] <|404notfound> oh yeah
[14:14] <Fractal> mobs?
[14:14] <|404notfound> mobs are in
[14:14] <sppt> Yohanu, i like long distance calling better
[14:14] <sppt> heh
[14:14] <Fractal> sweet
[14:14] <chibifs> Caves before water please, notch. :)
[14:15] <Yohanu> lol sppt
[14:15] <Yohanu> guitarist in witchcraft plays so much like deep purple
[14:15] <Fractal> no, water first, then I can make a person trigger a trap that turns the floor into lava
[14:15] <chibifs> haha
[14:16] <Nuky> Mmmmm. Lava.
[14:16] <Yohanu> tasty
[14:16] <Nuky> But, Fractal
[14:16] <Nuky> Only the floor is lava in infdev: there are no pools that I've seen.
[14:16] <Nuky> Instead of bedrock, I mean.
[14:17] <FakeSky> Aww not again
[14:17] <Fractal> no problem, dig a pit to that lava, then use torch supporting sand, when torch is removed, sand at that spot, turns to lava
[14:17] <FakeSky> It's raining.
[14:17] <FakeSky> For the 37th time. Today.
[14:18] <Nuky> Hrmm.
[14:18] <vurtual> I didn't find it guys :'(
[14:18] <Fractal> "moving" sand above any lava turns into fixed lava at that spot. Thank the notch that it doesn't flow!

[14:40] <Nesral> Well that's alot xD
[14:40] <Tommerry11> parent walks in, "AT 530 IN THE MORNING"
[14:40] <vurtual> it's a condition where boobs become massive, anywhere from "sorta funny looking, bearable to look at" to "massive yellow distortions for nipples"

[14:54] <Splattercaust> I'm hearing grunts followed quickly by splashes as mobs wander off of my rock islands, crashing onto the tiny shore before sliding into the water. It's pretty lolsy. Especially considering I still have water in my yard and I'm worried they're in my base.
[14:55] <Nuky> Yeah, they'll definitely spawn inside our bases now. =(
[14:55] <Nuky> Take THAT, Malikat!
[14:55] <DarkWolf> They will, why? :<
[14:55] <Nuky> "I'mma be ready! ;V"
[14:55] <Nesral> Bug?
[14:55] <Nesral> I'll guess
[14:55] <Nuky> Because they spawn like crazy? =)
[14:55] <Nuky> And my base is still dark. <_<
[14:56] * Nuky needs more coal!
[14:56] <Splattercaust> ALWAYS Torchrush immediately.
[14:56] <Nesral> Anyone got any crashes yet?
[14:56] <Nesral> (infdev)
[14:56] <Fractal> no
[14:56] <Splattercaust> And no, no crashing, no odd spawns for mobs for me. They still spawn in the dark.
[14:56] <Nesral> Is it more or less playable now?
[14:56] * Morkraw (whatshadow@5adb648b.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft

[14:57] <Fractal> well, torches and trees don't crash, but mobs everywhere

[14:57] <Nuky> I had to run and hide in a cave right away, Splatter. No time for coal hunting. Almost got exploded to death.
[14:58] <Splattercaust> Oh god.
[14:58] <Splattercaust> Pig army at the gates.
[14:58] <Nuky> D=
[14:58] <Splattercaust> o_O You should generate a map in the daytime. Plenty of time for torchrush.
[14:58] <Nuky> I have an army of sheep on my shore.
[14:58] <Nuky> I was collecting one (1) tree. <_<
[14:58] <Splattercaust> I fear it's a trojan horse ploy.
[14:59] <Nuky> Got dark.
[14:59] <Nuky> New trees take more time to chop =P
[14:59] <Splattercaust> I'm going to go out to fetch delicious pork... And a trio of creepers will drop down behind me!

[15:00] <Splattercaust> Need to build a high wall... Will do that come morning. D':
[15:01] <Nuky> Need to not die. Moar coal, NOW.
[15:01] <Nuky> Coal hidden. Not good.
[15:01] <Nuky> Bad coal, bad.
[15:01] <Nesral> Starting infdev now.

[17:29] <Yohanu> as suddenly one month i started making like $1.5k/mo
[17:29] <Notch> heh
[17:29] <Yohanu> and since i didnt work they found it VERY suspicious
[17:29] <Yohanu> paypal shut me out like twice
[17:29] <Notch> paypal made me send in all sorts of papers
[17:29] <Yohanu> had to verify my identity twice

[17:30] <Nuky> According to my calculations, Notch should be rich by now.
[17:30] <Notch> aha, haha
[17:30] <Yohanu> i came in and released mine just when all others had died
[17:30] <Yohanu> so i took the market monopoly!
[17:30] <bildramer> lol

[17:30] <bildramer> haha
[17:30] <Notch> Nuky: Yes, kind of. =D It's awesome

[17:30] <Nuky> =D
[17:30] <Notch> from june 1, I'll be full time indie, then I can stay that way for several years even if people totally stop buying my games
[17:31] <Nuky> Oh man, sweet.
[17:31] <bildramer> woot
[17:31] <Yohanu> though Notch, i was kicked out later on because i was inactive and my co-owners got greedy
[17:31] <Yohanu> lucky that happened tbh
[17:31] <Yohanu> the remaining owners filled the website with goldfarmer ads
[17:31] <Nuky> If only the same applied to animations <_<

[17:31] <Quatroking> oh wow Notch is on
[17:31] <Notch> hehe, that's kind of a shady business, isn't it, though?
[17:31] <Yohanu> i got away cus i was kicked out

[17:32] <Yohanu> not only did i learn java as a language
[17:32] <bildramer> lol
[17:32] <bildramer> how?
[17:32] <chibifs> Yohanu, Do you really want Notch to be distracted from coding while you rampage his empire with elephants?
[17:32] <Yohanu> i learned quite a bit about bytecode
[17:32] <Notch> I'll unblock you right away. It seemed awfully strange coming from you =)
[17:32] <Quatroking> Even if I were drunk I wouldn't be spamming that crap all around

[17:32] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, what do you think of clans?
[17:32] <Yohanu> no bildramer
[17:32] <bildramer> *puppy eyes*
[17:32] <Notch> I love clans
[17:32] <Quatroking> anyhoo, Notch, why do you need active displayport adapters?
[17:32] <Yohanu> when you are programming and inspired
[17:32] <Ten_Tacles> :D
[17:33] <Yohanu> you cannot stop
[17:33] <Ten_Tacles> :DD
[17:33] <bildramer> Notch, got coffee?
[17:33] <Yohanu> or you will lose motivation
[17:33] <Yohanu> !
[17:33] <bildramer> mebbe later
[17:33] <Galaxy654> !!!!
[17:33] <Notch> because eyefinity doesn't support more than two monitors on non-displayport
[17:33] <Notch> and my monitors only have DVI and HDMI inputs
[17:33] <Quatroking> oh that stuff
[17:33] <Yohanu> Notch, how expensive are apartments around stockholm
[17:33] <Galaxy654> MOnsters in infdev is working? yay
[17:33] <Notch> there ARE active displayport -> dvi adapters that fix this, but they're out of stock, and don't ship to sweden
[17:33] <Quatroking> I guess getting a second GPU is too expensive?
[17:33] <Notch> fairly expensive
[17:33] <Yohanu> i am forced to move there this fall :/
[17:33] <chibifs> I am up for aoe if you guys want to play, though.
[17:34] <Notch> Well, it depends on how lucky you are. =)
[17:34] <Yohanu> yeah i guess
[17:34] <Notch> you can find really cheap central apartments if you're lucky
[17:34] <Yohanu> cool
[17:34] <Quatroking> I _guess_ you could throw in some crossfire
[17:34] <Quatroking> not sure if that works with eyefinity tho
[17:34] <Notch> but still, it's fairly cheap compared to like london or new york
[17:34] <Yohanu> i'm going to have a 12 month education to become a java consultant Notch

[17:35] <Drewseph> nice desk setup btw
[17:35] <Notch> yeah, it's a BIG scratch
[17:35] <Quatroking> Notch, will you unblock me on twitter so I can watch you say things again?
[17:35] <Notch> but I'm actually getting used to it
[17:35] <Galaxy654> my base is not mob proof.... oh well
[17:35] <Notch> it adds character. :D
[17:35] <Drewseph> lol
[17:35] <Drewseph> Sandpaper it?
[17:35] <Notch> I got a tweet about some tips on how to fix it
[17:35] <Notch> I'd rather get a pro to sandpaper it.. I'd just mess it up more
[17:35] <Drewseph> lol
[17:35] <Notch> one of my friends works with stuff like that, kind of
[17:36] <Galaxy654> WAAAAAAAAAA
[17:36] <Quatroking> I can provide proof that some guy stole my twitter account :3
[17:36] <Galaxy654> spawn in my map
[17:36] <Galaxy654> BAM 2 creeper's spawn
[17:36] <Galaxy654> almost next to me in my base...
[17:36] <Galaxy654> :(
[17:36] <Fractal> just use progessivley finer sandpaper, and practice on the underneath
[17:36] <Nuky> Same happened here. I lost my furnace and other stuff, and stuff. =(
[17:36] <Galaxy654> oh skins are working
[17:37] <Yohanu> so, any decent indie game-scene in stockholm Notch ?
[17:37] <Drewseph> notch goodluck with that

[17:37] <Drewseph> actually
[17:37] <Drewseph> it should not be too hard ot do
[17:37] <Yohanu> i'd be interesting in taking part in some of those activities you see :P
[17:37] <Vicrry> yey, I has built a treefarm big enough that the first trees cut down are regrown by the time I've cut down the last trees :)

[17:41] <Quatroking> MP development or release?
[17:41] <chibifs> Water and caves, I hope. :)
[17:41] <Jat> notch is it normal for the constant hard drive grinding to interfere with playing in the current version of infdev?
[17:41] <Drewseph> water
[17:41] <smp> what about signs? it's been so long since we heard about them :(
[17:41] <Drewseph> gah too much water already lol
[17:41] <Yohanu> i had that problem once Jat
[17:41] <Yohanu> then i restarted and it stopped
[17:41] <Notch> well, it saves stuff to disk fairly agressively..
[17:41] <Drewseph> I miss my inland themes =)
[17:41] <Yohanu> it doesn't work particularily well on older hdd's Notch :P
[17:42] <Yohanu> i had massive problems
[17:42] <bildramer> Notch, why does the game sometimes grind to a halt?
[17:42] <Yohanu> it froze the whole pc when saving
[17:42] <bildramer> the framerate just randomly starts dropping
[17:42] <Notch> that's the level generator
[17:42] <bildramer> and it's not the day/night switch
[17:42] <Quatroking> oh, Notch, simple suggestion, add an option for the user to choose which directory to save Minecraft files in
[17:42] <Jat> for me its so bad that my fps is pretty low and the windows mouse cursor is constantly flickering in the middle of the minecraft window
[17:42] <bildramer> nor was I moving, I think
[17:42] <Yohanu> bildramer, synchronous map generation
[17:42] <Jat> also when i quit minecratf it takes like a minute for it to stop grinding
[17:42] <Yohanu> blocks ur thread
[17:42] <Notch> heh, hm
[17:42] <Yohanu> !
[17:42] <Notch> I wonder if I can fix that at all..
[17:42] <bildramer> :l
[17:42] <chibifs> Notch, it started today.
[17:43] <bildramer> put every small job to be done in a queue and make a limit to actions per frame
[17:43] <chibifs> After you added in the monsters.
[17:43] <bildramer> just as you're doing right now amirite
[17:43] <Notch> yeah, the mobs get saved
[17:43] <Drewseph> how do the mobs render?
[17:43] <Notch> ?
[17:43] <Drewseph> alot of the time they are nowhere near my z plane in indev
[17:44] <Drewseph> so while there are 200 of them I never ever see them
[17:44] <Drewseph> I go nights seeing only one enemy
[17:44] <Notch> they're just frustum culled at the moment
[17:44] <Drewseph> with infdev, there are chances the mobs won't be anywhere near me
[17:44] <Quatroking> jesus fuck thats a big scratch
[17:44] <Notch> yes, it's huge
[17:44] <Quatroking> also, IKEA detected?

[17:53] <Yohanu> i'm trying to think of nice ways to make generated puzzles for my adventure game gen
[17:53] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, didn't you already fixed that bug?
[17:53] <bildramer> >:|
[17:53] <Fractal> maybe only in slightly darker areas
[17:53] <Ten_Tacles> Fractal
[17:54] <Notch> i thought so
[17:54] <Yohanu> i already implemented a terrible random music generator!
[17:54] <ZomBuster> heelo
[17:54] <Yohanu> it picks random tones from a random scale!!
[17:54] <bildramer> wat
[17:54] <Ten_Tacles> INFDEV: The return of sandbug!
[17:54] <bildramer> what the hell with that bug
[17:54] <Yohanu> and builds it in a classic song pattern
[17:54] <bildramer> lol
[17:54] <Yohanu> o ye, i added minimap as well
[17:55] <Ten_Tacles> Omfgrofllolxd

[17:56] <Vicrry> Silly question, but why 64 as the stacking limit? Bitlimit of a variable type?
[17:57] <Drewseph> what is this sandbug exactly?
[17:57] <Yohanu> you use the key "m" to toggle between map and game
[17:57] <Yohanu> etc
[17:57] <bildramer> ugh markov

[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, ever seen a cube of destruction?
[18:11] <DarkWolf> Hey Notch, is it true that torches will be temporary lightsources down the line?
[18:11] <Fractal> when we get better traps, someone has to make a map of the film cube
[18:11] <Konogan> Ten, Ever seen a Borg Cube?
[18:11] <Fractal> DarkWolf: oh god noo
[18:12] <Ten_Tacles> No
[18:12] <DarkWolf> I've read that somewhere
[18:12] <Ten_Tacles> But a cube of destruction in minecraft is epic.
[18:12] <Notch> yes, it's looking likely, darkwolf
[18:12] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, did you?
[18:12] <DarkWolf> Will there be other methods of permanent lightning then?

[18:13] <bildramer> so they have an entity and a block
[18:13] <DarkWolf> Can you tell us a bit about these future lightsources thne?
[18:13] <bildramer> so you can have them be timed and not have a chance of disappearing every X seconds

[18:16] <Fractal> Superwafflez: only if you go to unexplored territory
[18:16] <Ten_Tacles> Road block like in infiminer maybe?
[18:16] <DarkWolf> Road...
[18:16] <Konogan> ^
[18:16] <DarkWolf> Maybe some rudamentry vehicles then?
[18:16] <DarkWolf> Like cart
[18:16] <DarkWolf> And horse!
[18:16] <Konogan> Pack horses.
[18:16] <Superwafflez> well we'd need half block triangles then
[18:16] <Superwafflez> for slopes
[18:17] <Konogan> So no cart.
[18:17] <Fractal> failing that, we can make stargates, and key in coordinates >.>
[18:17] <Konogan> I think.
[18:17] <DarkWolf> Or you just make the terrain level

[18:18] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[18:18] <DarkWolf> I think he meant that the viewmodel was ugly
[18:18] <Yohanu> Notch is there any paint-ish application that has a predefined set of EGA-only colors?
[18:18] <Konogan> If magic is supported, it seems like the best way to fast travel.
[18:18] <Yohanu> would be useful for me to draw some inspiration up
[18:19] <DarkWolf> What I really want to see is ally creeps
[18:19] <DarkWolf> Like a dog
[18:19] <DarkWolf> Mob I mean
[18:19] <Superwafflez> photoshop should have an EGA plugin
[18:20] <Drewseph> perhaps we should just let Notch work
[18:20] <Drewseph> and not bombard with questions
[18:20] <Fractal> or say his name
[18:20] <Konogan> XP's paint? If you saved your file in 64 color, it would only show you those colors in the color palette.

[18:21] <bildramer> You can't unload a truck full of bowling balls with a pitchfork.
[18:21] <DarkWolf> Hey hctoN!

[18:21] <DarkWolf> bildramer: You're terible

[18:29] <Notch> it's random

[18:31] <Superwafflez> cannibalised it
[18:31] <Notch> and I think I found one that has it
[18:31] <Notch> DisplayPort to DVI Dual Link Active Converter ? USB Powered
[18:31] <Fractal> why specifically an active one?
[18:31] <Notch> it needs to be for some reason
[18:31] <Superwafflez> eyefinity requires it I think...
[18:32] <Ten_Tacles> :O
[18:32] <Notch> eyefinity can drive two monitors over dvi or hdmi, the remaining HAVE to be displayport, OR have an active adapter
[18:32] <Ausfriend> i tried running eyefinity on 2 uneven monitors (16:9 and 5:4)
[18:32] <Ausfriend> fun time swere had
[18:32] <Superwafflez> well that sucks
[18:32] <Ten_Tacles> Is talking about memory editing forbidden here?
[18:32] <Ausfriend> and monitor was unusable for 2 weeks

[18:35] <Bodie> hi guys
[18:35] <FakeSky> Hi Bodie.
[18:36] <Bodie> notch isnt about is he?
[18:36] <Superwafflez> Savage 4 beats it =D
[18:36] <Chocolatey_Syrup> he was but I think he stepped out
[18:36] <Superwafflez> slightly
[18:36] <Notch> phew.. found the adapters.. 200 euro..
[18:36] <Bodie> i want to suggest that he removes the auto pause thing when you click out of minecraft
[18:36] <Quatroking> jesus
[18:36] <Notch> (for both and shipping)
[18:36] <Bodie> i hate standing around waiting for nighttime :(
[18:36] <Quatroking> and you need two of those?
[18:36] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I have to run off, if he ever answers whether we'll get caves and spawnpoint moving before multiplayer lemme know :3
[18:36] <Quatroking> oh
[18:36] <Quatroking> then I guess its cheaper than buying a second GPU
[18:36] <Notch> yeah, need two
[18:36] <Notch> yeah, and I can't FIT another GPU, hehe
[18:37] <Quatroking> well
[18:37] <Quatroking> buy a new case?
[18:37] <Quatroking> >:)
[18:37] <Quatroking> not sure if eyefinity works with two GPU's tho
[18:37] <Notch> besides, I want to do a three monitor stretch with eyefinity for L4D2 :D
[18:37] <Superwafflez> hehe
[18:37] <Superwafflez> D=
[18:37] <Notch> not sure
[18:37] <Quatroking> but you have four monitors
[18:37] <Notch> aye
[18:37] <Superwafflez> You must play oblivion on it. It's only right.
[18:37] <Notch> four monitor stretch sucks for gaming
[18:38] <Notch> so the fourth monitor will be the "chat" monitor where I keep irc and msn up while playing :D
[18:38] <Quatroking> ah
[18:38] <Superwafflez> Need odd numbers for gaming, crosshairs people.
[18:38] <Quatroking> I need to get me a third
[18:38] <Notch> and of course I'll add multi monitor support to minecraft
[18:38] <Superwafflez> =D
[18:38] <Notch> yeah, I tried two monitor stretch, but gaming got really difficult
[18:38] <Fractal> for linux too?
[18:38] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Notch, I'm not asking you to work on them, just wondering if they'll be in before multiplayer or not. ' w'c

[18:39] <Superwafflez> 22" ?
[18:39] <Ausfriend> alright
[18:39] <Drewseph> Hey notch, what is the klifespan fro dropped items?
[18:39] <Notch> and pretty darn kick-ass too, althought he "dynamic contrast" crap is a bit silly. ;)
[18:39] <Notch> I thought it was 22", but turns out they were 23"!
[18:39] <Superwafflez> :O
[18:39] <Ausfriend> I had a couple of strings from a spider that faded in about a second
[18:39] <Superwafflez> Bonus inch
[18:39] <Drewseph> for ex, i got killed my skeletons and tried to salvage my supplies and died 2 more times, all my supplies were still in the area, do they ever go away?
[18:39] <Ausfriend> and no, i didnt pik them up
[18:39] <Ausfriend> *pick
[18:40] <Quatroking> doo dee doo

[18:40] <Notch> so that's a total of 81" :D
[18:40] <Ausfriend> not really
[18:40] <Ausfriend> the sides negate
[18:40] <Superwafflez> Yeah.. hehe
[18:41] <Superwafflez> What's the resolution? :O
[18:41] <Notch> full hd
[18:41] <Superwafflez> I mean the combined desktop res lol.
[18:41] <Ausfriend> 1080 or 720?
[18:41] <Ausfriend> both are HD
[18:41] * Quatroking facepalms
[18:41] <Notch> Full hd!
[18:41] <Superwafflez> 3x 22" is like 5040 x 1050
[18:41] <Notch> 1080!
[18:41] <Vicrry> The most kickarse monitor setup I've seen was a 9 screen rig made almost exclusively for flight sim use
[18:41] <Quatroking> yeah but 720 aint full.
[18:42] <Quatroking> New comic is up; http://www.quatroworld.org/
[18:42] <Notch> so 7680 x 1080

[18:42] <Notch> i've got them set up in a bit of a circle shape, and my keyboard can move around easily. :D
[18:42] <DarkWolf> In Indev that is
[18:43] <Notch> yes, it is.
[18:43] <DarkWolf> Is it fixed soon? :D
[18:43] <Notch> it's part of why infdev got the new lighting engine
[18:43] <Notch> yes, when infdev replaces indev
[18:43] <DarkWolf> Ah
[18:43] <DarkWolf> Kewl
[18:43] <Fractal> notch, will water happen before infdev?
[18:43] <Superwafflez> If you dont use ultramon I might have to murder you D=
[18:43] <Quatroking> the new lighting engine is a LOT faster
[18:43] <Notch> what's ultramon?
[18:43] <Ausfriend> displayfusion is better

[18:43] <Ausfriend> not sure if its updated yet
[18:43] <Quatroking> it works fine on win7
[18:43] <Superwafflez> you get individual monitor taskbars!
[18:44] <Quatroking> I'm using it right now
[18:44] <Ausfriend> i use display fusion
[18:44] <Superwafflez> and quick controls to send windows to other monitors!
[18:44] <Quatroking> I like the way it adds buttons that enable me to quickly expand windows over both screens

[18:44] <Vicrry> Notch, could infdev load a indev map? I'm kinda liking my little world :)
[18:44] <Chocolatey_Syrup> he said eventually yeah :3c
[18:44] <Notch> i will write an importer. =)
[18:44] <Notch> before replacing indev
[18:44] <Chocolatey_Syrup> plus infdev will be able to generate limited size maps
[18:44] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, can you take a look?
[18:45] <chibifs> Notch: Would it be possible to have the new generator build around imported levels?
[18:45] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I spend too much time here, I know everything Notch has said ' 3'
[18:45] <Notch> says it's offline!

[18:49] <Demki> oh wait, but I need a mushroom
[18:50] <Superwafflez> random idea... should be able to make small storage bags out of cloth, that you could hide somewhere
[18:50] <Fractal> why a mushroom, demki?
[18:50] <Foshie> I want monsters to spawn later so i can build myself a hiding place before spawning :P
[18:50] <Demki> Fractal
[18:50] <Demki> I will show you a save file
[18:50] <Demki> with the half adder I made
[18:50] <Demki> a mushroom is in the OR
[18:50] <Demki> which later changes into a XOR
[18:50] <Fractal> what causes them to break that doesnt work with just torches?
[18:51] <Demki> sunlight
[18:51] <Demki> you need sunlight to break mushroom
[18:51] <Fractal> ooooh
[18:51] <Fractal> would, say, lavalight break mushrooms?
[18:51] <Demki> no
[18:51] <Demki> too weak
[18:51] <Demki> it can be only 1 level below sunlight
[18:51] <Demki> and torches produce that
[18:52] <Fractal> i need to propogate a signal downwards in infdev (eg, to break the floor)
[18:52] <Demki> ON THEMSELVES
[18:52] <Demki> use flowers
[18:52] <Demki> oh wait
[18:52] <Demki> you need flowers to get the signal down
[18:52] <Demki> I will show you a few things
[18:52] <Fractal> well, see this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVmLOZLaYnE

[18:53] <qaxie> set the difficulty to PEACEFUL
[18:53] <qaxie> and build
[18:53] <qaxie> then CHANGE I
[18:53] <Drewseph> I saw the suggestions thread but there are quite a few in there

[18:53] <Demki> wait

[18:54] <Drewseph> all you need to do is block the top tile and they just stand there in the doorway easy to kill from below
[18:54] <Foshie> qaxie, ah .. never changed that :P
[18:54] <Demki> fractal, for OR/XOR/NOR/XNOR you need a mushroom
[18:55] <Fractal> Demki: Oh yes, just torches and sand. i think it's impossible withough flowing water
[18:55] <Demki> it is POSSIBLE
[18:55] <Demki> I have made it
[18:55] <Fractal> or mushrooms
[18:55] <Demki> mushroom is only for the OR
[18:55] <Demki> and is much faster than water

[18:56] <Demki> what do you mean, ten?
[18:57] <Fractal> Demki: HM doesnt seem to quite work
[18:57] <Vicrry> another silly question, is there a method for keeping pigs/sheeps from spawning inside a building? I've loaded it with torches to grow crops and keep baddies away, but the place spawns lots of pigs inside when I leave to ruin my crops
[18:58] <Demki> fractal
[18:58] <Demki> I don't remember what each is
[18:58] <Demki> wait
[18:58] <Demki> if it is what I think it is
[18:58] <Demki> it should not let the signal flow
[18:58] <Superwafflez> build above or under ground?

[19:24] <Fractal> Demki: *functional, moving, water
[19:24] <Demki> fractal, do you understand how the XOR and AND works?
[19:25] <Fractal> relying on east west bug? aye
[19:25] <Demki> you know it took like 5 days to figure out both the AND and the OR
[19:25] <Quatroking> You guys know this Layar thing, right
[19:25] <Demki> and I figured out the XOR
[19:25] <Quatroking> wouldn't it be sweet if we had glasses that would add this layer
[19:25] <Demki> what layer?
[19:26] <Quatroking> like in Dennou Coil for example
[19:26] <Demki> huh?
[19:26] <Quatroking> layar is a cellphone app that makes use of the cam and adds a digital layer over the real world
[19:26] <Keiya> Ooh! Ooh!
[19:26] <Quatroking> for example, a digital poster on a wall
[19:27] <Quatroking> you look at the poster using your digital layer glasses and the image starts to move
[19:27] <Quatroking> show a trailer of a movie for example
[19:27] <Keiya> Notch should take his desk and scratch artwork into it
[19:27] <Keiya> Then it will look deliberate!
[19:27] <Notch> haha
[19:27] <Notch> good idea!
[19:27] <Quatroking> oh, about artowrk, Notch, will you add a fanart page?

[20:18] <Marach> "When the trigger on the Zapper is pressed, the game causes the entire screen to become black for one frame. Then, on the next frame, the target area is drawn in all white as the rest of the screen remains black. The Zapper detects this change from low light to bright light, as well as which frame the change was detected. This is how the game knows which target has been hit."

[20:35] <Chris220> Maybe they're actually sheep, dressed as creepers to stop you bashing them for their cloth
[20:35] <Kokopure> I think creepers are fine so long as they don't spawn in the light
[20:35] <bildramer> who wants some?
[20:35] <Drewseph> I really hope notch realizes that a game needs to work well before multiplayer
[20:35] <Kokopure> after all
[20:35] <Kokopure> if you don't want creepers asploding your base

[20:36] <Splatticus> Fuck indev quality.

[20:36] <Kokopure> infdev is such higher quality
[20:36] <Kokopure> actually
[20:36] <Splatticus> This is FUN. What happened to playing Minecraft for fun?

[20:37] <bildramer> chain reaction
[20:37] <bildramer> ever heard of one
[20:38] <Kokopure> dude
[20:38] <Kokopure> they don't explode when they're killed
[20:38] <bildramer> I know
[20:38] <Kokopure> if I got one to explode it would take out MAYBE two others
[20:38] <Splatticus> So guys.
[20:38] <bildramer> make them just explode
[20:38] <Kokopure> also
[20:38] <Splatticus> It's the trees.
[20:38] <bildramer> no, no
[20:38] <Kokopure> to make them explode
[20:38] <Kokopure> I would have to be DOWN THERE
[20:38] <bildramer> hurt everyone a little
[20:38] <Splatticus> And the infdev towers/cliffs.
[20:38] <bildramer> then make 1 explode
[20:38] <Kokopure> oh my god bildramer
[20:38] <Kokopure> you try that
[20:38] <bildramer> -_-
[20:38] <Splatticus> They make enough dark for the evil to spawn.
[20:38] <Kokopure> and let me know how it works out
[20:38] <Splatticus> Which makes sense.
[20:38] <Splatticus> I say keep it.
[20:38] <Kokopure> Splatticus, I agree with that
[20:38] <Kokopure> I also say keep it
[20:38] <Splatticus> I vote keep it.
[20:38] <Splatticus> Without a doubt.
[20:38] <Kokopure> I mean, the zombies and skeles burn in light anyway
[20:38] <bildramer> what about making a pillarhouse with the dirt?
[20:39] <Kokopure> so they can't venture far enough out to really mess with you
[20:39] <bildramer> then being safe for the rest of the game
[20:39] <Drewseph> YES YES!
[20:39] <Drewseph> I got it
[20:39] <bildramer> or just wait until it's day and they die... :|
[20:39] <Drewseph> a fix for the mobs just standing in a doorway
[20:39] <Keiya> Let's throw around random weird ideas for mobs.
[20:39] <Keiya> Flaming wookies!
[20:39] <Drewseph> Creepers should be able to detonate
[20:39] <Chris220> Sea monsters
[20:39] <bildramer> FLAMING WOOKIES
[20:39] <bildramer> seconded
[20:39] <Drewseph> but they don't detonate qhen you can't see their face
[20:40] <Chris220> What about rabid torches?
[20:40] <Chris220> Like, you put a torch up
[20:40] <bildramer> Notch, codin'?
[20:40] <Chris220> Turn your back to it
[20:40] <Drewseph> attempt to block the top half od f a door so they can be easy slughter = they blow up
[20:40] <Chris220> And boom, it gains sentience
[20:40] <Kokopure> yeah my base doesn't stand even a tiny chance
[20:40] <Kokopure> it's not even BORN yet
[20:40] <Kokopure> my walls are only 2 or 3 blocks high
[20:40] <Kokopure> and THIS happens
[20:40] <Kokopure> D:
[20:40] <Kokopure> well
[20:40] <Kokopure> it sure does make it challenging!
[20:41] <Kokopure> and I'd be lying if I said that while frustating, it was't entertaining as all hell
[20:41] <Keiya> Sea monsters?

[20:56] <KodaichiZero> epic minecraft dream last night
[20:57] <KodaichiZero> so I'm in this huge city, trying to put some scraps together for equipment
[20:57] <KodaichiZero> and this wizard-looking ugy comes over and decided to help me
[20:57] <bildramer> rofl
[20:58] <KodaichiZero> shows me how to put some rocks together into a huge rock so I could make a hammer
[20:58] <bildramer> second boss too
[20:58] <Splatticus> I wonder if monsters can spawn INSIDE trees... if they're dark.
[20:58] <KodaichiZero> and so then he leaves and I try some more stuff
[20:59] <KodaichiZero> eventually I figure out how to make some sticks into a gigantic pole, using this and the gigantic rocks, I make a gigantic spear
[20:59] * Yourself (yourself@c-98-222-52-154.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:59] <KodaichiZero> which looks more like a cane, but seems to 1-hit ko medium strength mobs
[20:59] <KodaichiZero> and so then I'm walking down the street, and as soon as he sees me with this weapon he challenges me to a fight
[21:00] <KodaichiZero> after a solid minute of fighting, I win with half my help and he tells me how strong I've become, etc etc
[21:00] <KodaichiZero> Then finally I decided to look for stuff in an underwater cave andthen end up drowning
[21:00] <KodaichiZero> the end
[21:02] <bildramer> third boss took some time
[21:02] <Splatticus> I fell through the trees. ]:
[21:02] <Splatticus> And it's dark.
[21:02] <Splatticus> And I died.
[21:02] <Splatticus> Luckily the skele shot me out before the creeper went boom.
[21:02] <KodaichiZero> dang.
[21:02] <KodaichiZero> ohhh
[21:02] <KodaichiZero> spawningworks nao?

[21:04] <rbos> they certainly feel short :)
[21:04] <rbos> OHGODOHGODOHGODOHGODOHGOD
[21:04] <Drewseph> feels like 5 min
[21:04] <Drewseph> they should be longer me thinks
[21:04] <KodaichiZero> so
[21:04] <Splatticus> Rofl.
[21:04] <Splatticus> So I pulled an Rbos.
[21:04] <KodaichiZero> i have a feeling this is going to be really epic
[21:05] <rbos> hah! at the bottom of cliffs, there's piles of pig meat
[21:05] <Splatticus> Let the creepers blow the shit out of the spawn point.
[21:05] <Splatticus> So now I'm in a hole fisticuffing about three skeles, one spider, and I think I killed the zombie.
[21:05] <Splatticus> I am vaguely reminded of my forefather, Spartacus, and his tournaments in similiar hole based situations. :l

[21:16] <LuciferZ> So, I was reflecting on things that I learned in Macroeconomics today
[21:17] <LuciferZ> And determined that the main flow of trade in multiplayer survival will be surface to underground.
[21:17] <LuciferZ> I personally, never want to go underground. I like grass and trees and sky.
[21:17] <LuciferZ> But other people hate the surface.
[21:18] <Drewseph> I'm sure notch misses caves too =0
[21:18] <Ten_Tacles> AND THE PANTS WERE DEAD
[21:18] <Yourself> bah, internet is still ridiculously slow
[21:18] <LuciferZ> In theory, the underground world can function without the surface. You can make trees and farms and so forth underground, although it's difficult and expensive
[21:19] <Yourself> downloading stuff at 33 KB/s
[21:19] <Dommys> http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/User:BaronW
[21:19] <Fractal> do trees grow?
[21:19] <Dommys> This is downright scary
[21:19] <Dommys> Yourself, ask comcast to come test your line signal. you might need a booster
[21:19] <LuciferZ> But mutual gain from trade basically insists that the underground focus totally on mining, and the surface focuses entirely on lumber and agriculture.

[21:22] <Dommys> Change it by one digit
[21:22] <Dommys> Reboot modem
[21:22] <Dommys> You'll force a new ip on Comcast protocols.
[21:22] <Dommys> As if you're a new computer requesting a new connection through that router. they'll drop your dhcp lease and automatically assign you a new one
[21:23] <Yourself> worth a shot
[21:23] <Dommys> If that doesn't help.
[21:23] <Dommys> You need to take your modem back, and swap it out, since you won't call them to get a line check.
[21:24] <Yourself> they swapped the modem 3 months ago when this last happened
[21:24] <Yourself> i will be very unhappy if this one's crapped out already

[21:26] <Yourself> anyway, i'll be changing the MAC address now
[21:26] <Dommys> *nod*
[21:27] <Splatticus> If they say "Let me put you through to my supervisor." Don't hang up. Dial back on the cursing/yelling, Be semi-polite but don't cow to the manager. If you sound like you know what the fuck you're talking about usually they'll stop feeding you the bullshit tech support and do what you tell them to. Which is what Dommys here will tell you to tell them. :P Teamwork!
[21:27] <Yourself> "If you sound like you know what the fuck you're talking about usually they'll stop feeding you the bullshit tech support and do what you tell them to."
[21:27] <Yourself> i definitely know that that's not true
[21:27] <Splatticus> Within reason.
[21:28] <Yourself> alright, there's the mac address, now where do i change it

[21:48] <Yourself> cool
[21:48] <DarkWolf> Why?
[21:48] <Splatticus> I love how people think video games don't teach/promote higher brain functions.
[21:49] <DarkWolf> Oh hell yes I'm back
[21:49] <Splatticus> Math is fucking everywhere in games.

[21:49] <Splatticus> I know I can build 4 stone pickaxes because I have a stack of twelve stones, divided by three for the axe-head that makes 4.
[21:49] <LuciferZ> Darkwolf: Dysgalt's D3 Build Server
[21:49] <Yourself> that's because math is awesome
[21:50] <DarkWolf> Summary/details of the server LuciferZ ?
[21:50] <LuciferZ> Multiworld D3 server, with a guest area so that's the only thing that ever gets griefed really.
[21:50] <KodaichiZero> you can make a helmet, boots, and pants all at the same time
[21:50] <LuciferZ> Main flatgrass map, a space map, an ocean map
[21:50] <KodaichiZero> by stacking the materials
[21:51] <DarkWolf> Lol KodaichiZero
[21:51] <LuciferZ> I think it has a landscape map on, can't remember.
[21:51] <ZomBuster> I always do that KodaichiZero
[21:51] <DarkWolf> Awesome LuciferZ, is it active?
[21:51] <KodaichiZero> yeaa
[21:51] <LuciferZ> Yep, averages about ten users on all the time.

[21:52] <Keiya> Mmm, perhaps...
[21:52] * Keiya shrugs
[21:53] <Splatticus> If you pop it up in games, you'll be quicker to pop it up when paying the cashier, etc.
[21:53] <Keiya> True, I guess.
[21:53] <Yourself> it's also more than knowing how to divide, it's also knowing when and what it actually means to divide
[21:53] <Yourself> which i think is what Splatticus is saying
[21:53] <Keiya> That's true, too.
[21:53] <Keiya> Hmm.
[21:54] <LuciferZ> FFFFFUUUUU
[21:54] <Keiya> Still think you should get a mixed diet of brainfood though :P
[21:54] <Splatticus> Idk, I just think about things like that, because I'm a manic bipolar who's been misdiagnosed with ADHD, and I've always kind of been a problem child with math, which is sad because I like math. D: And I think using games to teach would make ADHD kids understand better.
[21:54] <Yourself> start a math argument, i love those
[21:54] <Keiya> Splatticus: Oh, I agree with that.
[21:54] <Splatticus> Because they'd go "OOH TEACHER LETS ME PLAY GAMES. U:"
[21:54] <Speljohan_> haha bildramer this is truly fucked up
[21:55] <Splatticus> But then teacher goes. "You have seven sticks, and six blocks."
[21:55] <Keiya> Splatticus: The only reason educational games don't work is because they're mostly crappy games.
[21:55] <Splatticus> God.
[21:55] <Speljohan_> 4 old irc friends of mine are currently striking deals with people to make ME money
[21:55] <Speljohan_> madness
[21:55] <Splatticus> Then you're getting into remainders!
[21:55] <Splatticus> You can use six of the sticks with a remainder of one.
[21:55] <Keiya> Indeed :J
[21:55] <Splatticus> It's boggling!
[21:56] <Splatticus> U:
[21:56] <Splatticus> Some people might just think of it as "Ffff extra stick -.- I'll just use it as furnace fuel."
[21:56] <Splatticus> But that son of a bitch is a remainder!

[21:59] <Speljohan_> cool
[21:59] <Keiya> (Not really, but that's more because HHH is breakable and the bits get lost >_>)
[21:59] <Splatticus> This is going to blow your mind.
[21:59] <Speljohan_> except i'm not doing anything at all
[21:59] <Speljohan_> to earn it
[21:59] <LG_Legacy> See how fast i got promoted? Apparently they are promoting just the people they seem they trust

[21:59] <Splatticus> I think.

[22:02] <Splatticus> Idk. Maybe an actual randomly generated path system, if that's possible. I mean the idea has been around for a while.
[22:02] <Keiya> So you can't go over hills?
[22:02] <Splatticus> I don't see why the road-blox can't go up a hill like a hill normally goes.
[22:02] <Keiya> Remember, it'd have to be detectable by the computer, not just you.
[22:02] <ZomBuster> generator should only generate natural features
[22:02] <Keiya> Splatticus: Because it's not flat
[22:02] <ZomBuster> just go trough the hill
[22:02] <Splatticus> Keiya, yeah it is.
[22:03] * DarkWolf (Mibbit@80.101.112.30) has joined #minecraft
[22:03] <Splatticus> Build the road like a hill is.

[22:03] <Splatticus> Seems gay, but to the eye it would super-work.
[22:03] <LuciferZ> It's still bullshit, lol. Zuriki doesn't seem to know the D3 server software at all.
[22:03] <Keiya> Splatticus: Flat means all on the same level.
[22:03] <Keiya> To the eye, sure
[22:03] <Keiya> Computers don't have eyes
[22:03] <Splatticus> You do.
[22:03] <Splatticus> The computer generates a hill, right?
[22:03] <Keiya> So you're telling it manually where roads are?
[22:03] <Yourself> <Keiya> Splatticus: Flat means all on the same level.
[22:03] <Splatticus> It makes slopes.
[22:03] <Yourself> not necessarily
[22:03] <Yourself> cliffs can be flat
[22:04] <Keiya> That's just spawn flags basically
[22:04] <Keiya> Yourself: True >_>
[22:04] <Splatticus> Why can't it do that, but instead of placing massive ammounts of dirt bricks, place three wide sections of cobblestone?

[22:10] <Splatticus> Fuck with your shit, you kill them, lol respawn pick up their items, continue.
[22:10] <Splatticus> I think.
[22:10] <Splatticus> It needs to be team based.

[22:10] <Topple> you there?
[22:10] <Splatticus> Person logged into the team the longest is team leader and can designate the team's spawn area.
[22:10] <Fractal> maybe 8 special blocks that when arranged in vertex of cube arrangement, protected the contents and themselves
[22:11] <gdude2002> but in normal mp survival, with smaller maps, the spawns shouldn't be moved.
[22:11] <bildramer> Malikat, you there?
[22:11] <Splatticus> idk, this is hurting my brain.
[22:11] <Topple> nobody is here aahhh
[22:11] <Splatticus> Brb for relaxing minecraft.
[22:11] <Keiya> Splatticus: What if spawnflags weren't precise?
[22:11] <Keiya> Say, you would spawn somewhere within that chunk and its eight neighbors?
[22:11] <Splatticus> Topple, just because notch doesn't talk doesn't mean we're nobody.
[22:11] <Splatticus> Still.
[22:12] <Splatticus> I dunno. I think there should be centralized, group-based spawnpoints.
[22:12] <Topple> but
[22:12] <Yourself> why not make spawn flags a resource that you have to craft from other things?
[22:12] <Topple> your nobody
[22:12] <Yourself> and you can't destroy your spawn flag to move it

[22:23] <Notch> thanks, but don't worry about it =)
[22:23] <Notch> :D
[22:23] <gear1> so will it not blow up easily
[22:23] <chibifs> marach, i see no change
[22:24] <Topple> Also, I was playing Infdev one morning before I had to do stuff
[22:24] <Marach> yeah, you're a free user
[22:24] <Topple> and I turned off my computer with the browser open
[22:24] <Malikat> hi notch
[22:24] <Dommys> So we can make Iron Sticks (rebar) and craft stone with rebar to make Reinforced Stone? ;P
[22:24] <Mive> What are those gray bricks you are talking about Notch? : P
[22:24] <Topple> and it deleted the world. D:
[22:24] <Topple> I think thats a bug or stupidity on my part
[22:24] <Marach> (or you didnt look wel enough)
[22:24] <Marach> well*
[22:24] <Keiya> Nails aren't that hard.
[22:24] <Keiya> I can scratch them pretty easily >_>
[22:24] <Topple> If its as hard as nails
[22:24] <Dommys> I scratch with my nails!
[22:24] <Yourself> now we just need rock climbing equipment, ragggggghhhhhhh
[22:24] <Topple> Please update with a hammer. :C
[22:24] <Dommys> *scratches*
[22:24] <Yourself> craft steel pitons
[22:25] <Malikat> Notch, was the torch / seedling bug related to the water placement bug?

[22:25] <Dommys> That's awesome
[22:25] <Marach> it is

[22:29] <Topple> Ha, it's so funny watching Pigs and Sheep fall off cliffs in Infdev
[22:30] <Marach> bildramer is right about the time.
[22:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> wat
[22:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> We have pigs and sheep in infdev now?

[22:30] <Topple> yep outsomnia
[22:30] <Splatticus> Mobs are back in outsomnia.
[22:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> Oh jesussssssyessssss
[22:30] <Topple> They climb up to cliffs
[22:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> Monsters too?

[22:30] <Marach> mobs of monsters!
[22:30] <Splatticus> Everything.
[22:30] <Topple> and fall off
[22:30] <Splatticus> Sand and Gravel.
[22:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> YesssSSSSS-kablam
[22:30] <rbos> dozens and dozens of monsters
[22:30] <Dommys> Wtf do you need ops for anyways? they never do anything.. lol

[22:34] <Drewseph> its not
[22:35] <outsomnia|Clinton> It's still in development.

[22:43] <Drewseph> We NEED more enemies now
[22:43] <Drewseph> I mean more types of enemies
[22:43] <Drewseph> and the doorway exploit needs to be removed
[22:44] <Serow> Doorway exploit?
[22:44] <Malikat> doorway exploit?
[22:44] <Fractal> Drewseph: what doorway exploit? where you hack away at thier ankles?
[22:44] <Malikat> SEROOOOW
[22:44] <Drewseph> yes
[22:44] <Serow> That's no exploit, that's tactics.
[22:44] <Fractal> that's goddamn tactics
[22:44] <Drewseph> ugh its an exploit
[22:44] <Drewseph> makes enemies not a threat
[22:44] <Drewseph> anyway the enemies should just walk away if they can't see you
[22:44] <Fractal> and when you need to move away from your house??
[22:44] <Drewseph> aka put a block in their facre
[22:45] <Drewseph> and for creepers they should splode
[22:45] <Fractal> doorway trick is only helpful if you intend never to move
[22:45] <Drewseph> fractal what do you mean
[22:45] <Drewseph> move from home?
[22:45] <Fractal> aye
[22:45] <Drewseph> its still an exploit
[22:45] <Fractal> say, for resources
[22:45] <Drewseph> i can make a barricade in less than 30 seconds
[22:46] <Drewseph> and then simply exploit to live
[22:46] <Fractal> and then what?
[22:46] <Drewseph> you can do the doorway trick ANYWHERE
[22:46] <Drewseph> thats what i mean
[22:46] <Fractal> well, isn't living such fun, living in a box
[22:46] <Drewseph> in caves and mine shafts
[22:46] <Splatticus> Can't remember where my base is. ]: Really wish I had a road.
[22:46] <Drewseph> plop, with a click you're safe
[22:46] <Fractal> and stuck
[22:46] <Drewseph> no
[22:46] <Drewseph> the problem is
[22:46] <Drewseph> this doorway exploit allows the player to sit in luxury while you slay the 50+ enemies outside 1 by one
[22:47] <Drewseph> its too easy

[22:47] <Drewseph> higher difficulties = smarter AI
[22:47] <Fractal> ok, so you've killed your enemies, you are stuck in a box. You move from your box, and suddenly, more enemies
[22:47] <Malikat> i like the idea of creepers exploding
[22:47] <Serow> It's not an exploit, it's just tactical. If that's an exploit, then building a wall is an exploit. Oh no, Torches are exploits, they stop monsters from spawning in a place!

[22:48] <Fractal> fire is an exploit, because you can use the flint to burn your enemies
[22:48] <Drewseph> yeah wtf does that mean?
[22:48] <Malikat> stone masonry
[22:48] <Splatticus> I think that they should be scared of the light, but willing to risk two or three blocks to get to you.
[22:48] <Malikat> it's in the forum
[22:48] <Drewseph> does grey block = the ones you have to bake currently?
[22:48] <Fractal> a really hard, and hard to make block
[22:48] <Malikat> who was it that stone masonry suggested
[22:48] <Luraman> :P Ill go look
[22:48] <Splatticus> But if they pass that range, they go back for the dark.
[22:49] <Splatticus> Also, light should cause creepers to initiate, like a slow-tick.
[22:49] <Splatticus> Where they can still move.
[22:49] <Fractal> splatticus: so then there is no defence , not even walls? that would suck
[22:50] <Drewseph> splat you mean they should gradually pop?
[22:50] <Splatticus> There's always water, Fractal.
[22:50] <Splatticus> Eventually, yes.
[22:50] <Drewseph> NO
[22:50] <Fractal> Splatticus: it would be all "i've built a base to be safe, ohshit, now it is exploded by invisible foes"
[22:50] <Splatticus> All mobs in some way should be limited to the dark.
[22:50] <Drewseph> I don;t want to come hope after days of digging to find craters all over my yard
[22:50] <Splatticus> If you have no dark around your base.
[22:50] <Drewseph> home*

[22:50] <Malikat> and put them in a square
[22:50] <Malikat> to get 2 masonry stones
[22:50] <Splatticus> If they leave the dark, they begin to die, creepers lean towards exploding.

[22:51] * Fractal is now known as FractalFooding
[22:51] <Serow> Creepers shouldn't explode in any situation other than to attack you, or they become too much of a problem for trying to build anything.
[22:51] <Malikat> that's the point of creepers
[22:51] <bildramer> If you don't know basic science, you shouldn't be able to express any opinions
[22:51] <Splatticus> What I am suggesting.
[22:51] <bildramer> AT ALL
[22:51] <Splatticus> Isn't that far of a point.

[22:52] <Splatticus> "Monsters spawn in the dark."
[22:52] <Drewseph> we get that

[22:52] <Splatticus> Notch has it coded in as "Light." Period.
[22:52] <Drewseph> looks like this isn't gonna work out
[22:53] <Drewseph> =)
[22:53] <Splatticus> I've put down torches, only to have a pig suddenly spawn.
[22:53] <Malikat> glucose is a sugar.
[22:53] <Serow> Splatticus, if Creepers did that, they'd slowly explode all your torches, then your wall, then all of your building.
[22:53] <Splatticus> Btw that's why your bases are filling up.
[22:53] <gear1> animals spawn in light
[22:53] <Brett> There are levels of light, Splatticus
[22:53] <Splatticus> Serow.
[22:53] <Splatticus> That makes for a fun story. :U
[22:53] <Brett> Levels that torches and lava aren't bright enough to generate
[22:53] <Brett> so there is 'sunlight'
[22:53] <Splatticus> Also, Not if they can't leave the dark willingly.
[22:53] <Brett> there's also capability for colored light, too
[22:53] <gear1> actually
[22:53] <Serow> No, it doesn't. It makes for a game where people ONLY build floating structures because the ground is WORTHLESS
[22:53] <gear1> torches can spawn animals
[22:53] <Splatticus> I dunno, maybe I'm not explaining it well enough.
[22:54] <Splatticus> Serow stop thinking about yourself, and think about the game. You're getting idea-tunnelvision.
[22:54] <Luraman> :3 Found the thread... Like it +
[22:54] <Splatticus> Luraman, link for the lazy?
[22:54] <gear1> whats the arguement here?
[22:54] * SpyLevels_ is now known as SpyLevels
[22:54] <Splatticus> Even if you built a floating island.
[22:54] <Luraman> brb for link
[22:54] <Splatticus> The island will still get dark.
[22:54] <Serow> I'm thinking about the game - And creepers that explode in the light isn't fun. That's why they don't explode in the sunlight - It causes too many problems. Notch did this for a reason.
[22:54] <Splatticus> And creepers will spawn.
[22:55] <Luraman> Here> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=11594
[22:55] <Splatticus> Creepers that explode in the light, but are limited to the dark.
[22:55] <gear1> ugh
[22:55] <Splatticus> Do you not get that idea?
[22:55] <Drewseph> no
[22:55] <gear1> thats obnoxious
[22:55] <Drewseph> we don't liek that idea
[22:55] <Drewseph> they should not explode in light perdio
[22:55] <gear1> creepers used to explode whenever they died
[22:55] <Drewseph> ex, you have a mine, you have torches
[22:55] <Serow> I understand it, and you don't seem to understand that it's not fun, or even a good risk.
[22:55] <Splatticus> I didn't ask if you liked it, I asked if you got it. Do you understand it?
[22:55] <Drewseph> you are digging and a creeper down the hall pops
[22:55] <gear1> and that was a pain in the ass
[22:55] <Drewseph> and takes out the wall
[22:55] <Luraman> That would be kinda laggy and killy! O_O
[22:55] <Drewseph> and WATER FLOODS THE CAVE
[22:55] <Drewseph> fuck that
[22:56] <Drewseph> creepers no die in light
[22:56] <Drewseph> perdiod
[22:56] <Splatticus> My ideas are basically based around how to make the infdev spawns more user friendly. :l
[22:56] <gear1> but it was funny when you would have a pit filled with creeps
[22:56] <gear1> and they would all nuke each other
[22:56] <Drewseph> Splat, i respect your idea though
[22:56] <Splatticus> Without editting them too much. I like it.
[22:56] <Clinton|Shepard> lol "user friendly"
[22:56] <Drewseph> its pretty cool
[22:56] <Drewseph> but it won't work on a gameplay level

[22:58] <Drewseph> Zombies should burry into the ground and dissapear
[22:58] <Drewseph> de-spawn
[22:58] <Clinton|Shepard> You need gunpowder from Creepers.

[22:58] <ClassiestMedic> or NBTedit
[22:58] <Drewseph> dude
[22:58] <Splatticus> And I agree. :l I don't like cobblestone for building. It just looks ugly from a distance.

[22:59] <Splatticus> Okay now the new question.
[22:59] <Dommys> South Park started a KFC movement
[22:59] <Clinton|Shepard> You did see it, you just don't remember it.

[23:03] <Classiest|Infdev|MOBS> I have
[23:03] <Luraman> Couldn't win the first game but i did do the second
[23:03] <Splatticus> You dig slower?
[23:04] <Classiest|Infdev|MOBS> Yeah
[23:04] <Malikat> A+ idea
[23:04] <Marach> ...everyone did.
[23:04] <Splatticus> Maybe that could use that in MP.
[23:04] <Azathoth> wouldn't it be cool if instead of smelting cobblestone to smooth it, you used a chisel tool or something?
[23:04] <Luraman> Yeah lol first one was insane
[23:04] <Splatticus> Enemy digs slower on your territory.
[23:04] <Marach> it's like that so you cant make yourself water pockets
[23:04] <Luraman> Mostly because im a dane

[23:06] * Classiest|Infdev|MOBS does both at the same time
[23:06] <Azathoth> chisels aren't huge
[23:06] * Marach does all of the above
[23:06] <Splatticus> It'd be a reversed sword, so maybe.

[23:26] <Splatticus> I'm actually sitting indian style on a chair with my arms crossed when I'm not typing.
[23:26] <Splatticus> On a pillow, rather.

[23:27] <Azathoth> i'm sitting chair style
[23:27] <Ten_Tacles> I am about to catch a tribe of cave swallowman :D

[23:27] <Ten_Tacles> Good?

[23:27] <Azathoth> on a chair with my arms on the keyboard when i'm not typing
[23:27] <vurtual> my legs are above me
[23:27] <Marach> Azathoth: why did i just read that as topless

[23:29] <bildramer> They're dead, I tell ya
[23:29] <Azathoth> i wish i had 9 screens
[23:29] <bildramer> just lurkin'
[23:29] <bildramer> I wish I had 144 screens
[23:29] <Azathoth> you'd have to build some kind of metal scaffolding to keep them up
[23:29] <Azathoth> in fact, if i had 9 screens, i'd probably not want a desk. just something to hold up my keyboard and mouse
[23:30] <Azathoth> with a dome of screens in front of me
[23:30] <gdude2002|away> epic.

[23:36] <Peerko> people who don't want to spell right are inevitable too, I live with it.
[23:36] <Cydoniac> I don't like to see it decimated D:

[23:49] <Cydoniac> I have gotten consistent 90%'s all the year and then complex numbers came on a test and it went down to 50%
[23:49] <gdude2002|away> :P
[23:49] <bildramer> look, just say a mathematician wanted to know what the root of -1 and -2 and so on and so on is
[23:49] <gdude2002|away> I never did that well
[23:49] <gdude2002|away> honors/ordinary?
[23:49] <bildramer> so he added a dimension to numbers
[23:49] <Fractal> sqrt-4 = 2i, you FOOOL
[23:49] <bildramer> what
[23:49] <gdude2002|away> Fractal: noob.
[23:49] <Vicrry> root of -1 is i
[23:50] <bildramer> yes
[23:50] <rbos> yeah, sqrt(-2) is sqrt(2)*i
[23:50] <bildramer> sqrt(2) <3
[23:50] <bildramer> which is valid math, too
[23:50] <bildramer> :P
[23:50] <Vicrry> lolz bil :P
[23:50] <Cydoniac> Uhh
[23:50] <gdude2002|away> :P
[23:50] <Cydoniac> i^2 is -1
[23:50] <Fractal> sqrt-2 = i*sqrt2
[23:50] <Cydoniac> So i is root-1 yeah
[23:50] <bildramer> indeed
[23:50] <bildramer> well
[23:50] <bildramer> (a + bi)^2 =
[23:50] <gdude2002|away> ah, bild
[23:51] <gdude2002|away> I see what he's getting at
[23:51] <bildramer> a^2 - b^2 + 2abi
[23:51] <gdude2002|away> sqrt(4) == 2
[23:51] <bildramer> and that's how I made some epic fractals
[23:51] <Cydoniac> Then there's polar form
[23:51] <bildramer> gdude: no
[23:51] <gdude2002|away> so sqrut(-4) = i*2
[23:51] <bildramer> it can be -2
[23:51] <gdude2002|away> yeah
[23:51] <gdude2002|away> but
[23:51] <Cydoniac> cos0 + rsin0 or something
[23:51] <rbos> when does diamond ore go into infdev?
[23:51] <gdude2002|away> keeping it simple
[23:51] <Fractal> cos(n)+i*sin(n)
[23:51] <bildramer> polar = angle + radius

[23:53] <Cydoniac> Still don't know how I got 10/10
[23:53] <Ten_Tacles> God those dwarves are dumb.
[23:53] <Yourself> complex numbers are nice because they allow you to finally have polynomials of degree n with exactly n roots
[23:53] <bildramer> lol
[23:53] <Cydoniac> But I suspect she wasn't really correcting them
[23:53] <Yourself> possibly with multiplicity
[23:53] <Cydoniac> Because a friend only did half the test and got the same score
[23:54] <bildramer> I got 58/52 points in a math/computer science/stuff test
[23:54] <bildramer> yeah
[23:54] <bildramer> so technically a 0 or 0-
[23:54] <Codlike_> Grey Brick?
[23:54] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.54.82) Quit (Quit: Quitting)
[23:54] <Yourself> so in some sense, complex numbers are more complete than real numbers
[23:55] <bildramer> had 6 additional points because I was one of the few who did the last thingy correctly
[23:55] <bildramer> it was hilariously easy, I can just get As by... idliong
[23:55] <Yourself> damn, it's hot as hell in here
[23:55] <bildramer> lding*
[23:55] <bildramer> idling*
[23:55] <Yourself> it's not supposed to be this hot in april
[23:55] <bildramer> lol
[23:55] <bildramer> here the weather is undecisive
[23:55] <Yourself> well the weather's always a bit erratic around here
[23:55] <Cydoniac> Well at least it didn't rain
[23:56] <Cydoniac> That's a good day in Ireland
[23:56] <Yourself> there is no spring and fall
[23:56] <bildramer> also, why the hell does my school test fire alarms
[23:56] <Yourself> there's hot and cold
[23:56] <Yourself> the transition between the two usually lasts about a week
[23:56] <bildramer> everyone knows it's just an exercise
[23:56] <bildramer> so they walk like snails to the exits
[23:56] <bildramer> also, there are major flaws like exits being locked
[23:56] <bildramer> sucks
[23:56] <Yourself> and the transition usually doesn't occurr until May
[23:56] <bildramer> if there's a real fire, there will be FUCKTONS OF PANIC
[23:56] <Cydoniac> I worry about school next year
[23:56] <Yourself> occur*
[23:57] <bildramer> I'll just wait inside then calmly walk away
[23:57] <Cydoniac> I'm going to need such high points
[23:57] <Vicrry> OMGFIRE! :p
[23:57] <bildramer> OMG
[23:57] <bildramer> LET'S OVERREACT
[23:57] <bildramer> ideas plz
[23:57] * Icereed (icereed@mnch-5d8582c7.pool.mediaWays.net) Quit (Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de)
[23:57] <bildramer> how not to go to school
[23:57] * Griskard (chatzilla@181.165.dsl.syd.iprimus.net.au) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.0.19/2010031422])
[23:57] <Yourself> i never understood fire drills because there was practically no conceivable way a fire could ever start
[23:57] <Ten_Tacles> DAMN
[23:57] <Ten_Tacles> DAMN
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> DAMN
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> DAMN
[23:58] <Cydoniac> Tell the truth D:
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> DAMN
[23:58] <Vicrry> ...
[23:58] <bildramer> shuddup
[23:58] <LuciferZ> Hey, does today's infdev update have any major bugs I should be warned of?
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> DAMN
[23:58] <bildramer> op
[23:58] <bildramer> LuciferZ: don't think so
[23:58] <Cydoniac> Hey Yourself
[23:58] <Codlike_> lots and lots of enemies spawn
[23:58] <bildramer> beware of creepers
[23:58] <Cydoniac> That's not entirely true
[23:58] <bildramer> yeah
[23:58] <bildramer> about 20 a time
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> Its good :D
[23:58] <Ten_Tacles> YOu get much stuff
[23:58] <Vicrry> Set it on wtf difficulty :P
[23:58] <Cydoniac> There are classes in school in which a fire could easily be started
[23:58] <bildramer> hehehehe.
[23:58] <Yourself> not in my school
[23:58] <bildramer> chemistry ftw
[23:58] <Cydoniac> Any Science subject for example
[23:59] <Cydoniac> Oh god Chemistry
[23:59] <Vicrry> Take shop class. Attempt to weld
[23:59] <Yourself> no, there was no fire allowed
[23:59] <Cydoniac> It's so abstract
[23:59] <Vicrry> On the gas can
[23:59] <bildramer> or maybe... hm...
[23:59] <Tiberrias> it lagged my comp horribly for a moment, when such horde of pigs appeared
[23:59] <Tiberrias> :D
[23:59] <Cydoniac> I can't see things on a molecular level
[23:59] <bildramer> no, actually, only Chemistry
[23:59] <Vicrry> YOU NOW HAS FIAR!
[23:59] <bildramer> Cydoniac: they're little balls
[23:59] <Yourself> no bunsen burners, no matches, nothing combustible
[23:59] <bildramer> *cough* *cough*
[23:59] <bildramer> -_-
[23:59] <Yourself> they're waves
[23:59] <LuciferZ> Hey Tiberrias!
