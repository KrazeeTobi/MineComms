[1:24] <Willox> Im gonna put one on my dedi to pwn all the failhomehosters
[1:24] <morton> Its gonna require a whole lot more resources from the server though thps3m8

[1:50] <Flot> Also, without a doubt. TNT will be one of the rarest resources in SMP. People will be setting up mining camps at the bottom of the map just to find rare ore.

[3:53] <GreenHoopla> That's called a creeper

[3:59] <SkindianaBones> What's wrong with multiple endings?

[3:59] <slot9> uh. in the inventory?

[4:01] <TrueWolves> Anyhow, Iji does not have multiple endings. It has a main ending and then a joke ending you can only get after 100% completion through a controvolted meothod that's not even worth it or that funny, and isn't even a real other ending.
[4:01] <Shrub74> Nuts in a vice.
[4:01] <TrueWolves> It does however change the story leading up to the ending based on weather you kill or not.
[4:02] <Shrub74> oh god
[4:02] <JabJabJab> lol
[4:02] <Shrub74> even worse, non-linear storytelling v.v;;

[4:03] <c418> but in truth you know that you have no idea, really
[4:03] <TrueWolves> Shrub, play the game once and see what I'm talking about?
[4:03] <Perry> " For that, you'll have to wait until Portal 3"
[4:03] <Perry> \o/
[4:03] <Shrub> If things change depending on what you do it's non-linear

[4:09] <TrueWolves> Iji is concidered one of the best games ever made with "Game Maker"
[4:09] <OODavo> Ultimate means last.
[4:09] <Shrub> Game maker?!
[4:09] <OODavo> It only means last.
[4:09] <Shrub> I'm sold!

[4:09] <TrueWolves> ... ok?
[4:09] <Clearbrook> generally when someone says "Ultimate" is means the last great
[4:09] <TrueWolves> o.O;
[4:10] <muddtusk> How about penultimate?
[4:10] <Shrub> Antepenultimate!
[4:10] <TrueWolves> The good thing: Iji's music can easily be changed by replacing the mp3'd in the music folder with your own mp3's. The bad thing(?): Iji's music is usualy to awesome to replace.
[4:10] <Shrub> Well
[4:10] <Shrub> I'm gonna play in fullscreen
[4:10] <Shrub> see you guys soon
[4:10] <muddtusk> Ultimate Antler, shrub-a-dub.
[4:11] <TrueWolves> Byea'
[4:11] <Shrub> no u
[4:11] <Clearbrook> penultimate generally is only used as in "second last" since it isn't used in slang
[4:11] * ylt (youliketha@92.19.169.207) has joined #minecraft
[4:11] <OODavo> Ultimate means last, only.
[4:11] <Clearbrook> but it's used as "Last great" in slang
[4:11] <OODavo> For some reason, penultimate isn't used as slang. :/
[4:11] <OODavo> I reject your slang and substitute accurate language!
[4:11] <Clearbrook> yea I know, it's an awesome word
[4:12] <OODavo> Slang should not be permitted to take over actual, existing words.
[4:12] <Clearbrook> well at least it can be used in the definition of it's slang meaning
[4:12] <Perry> ...Are you really *still* talking about slang?
[4:13] <Perry> Might not be the most interesting topic ever :L

[4:19] <TheCactusman> Hi there
[4:19] <Clearbrook> throwing tomatoes
[4:19] <TheCactusman> Why has c418 got a small C?
[4:19] * laCour is now known as Guest756643037
[4:19] * Guest756643037 is now known as laCour
[4:19] <TrueWolves> It's not as effeicent as holding all 5 ingredents (14 hearts total) but it is a LOT more space-effeicent which is more important with food.

[4:20] * CeSuZ (patrik.per@62.20.189.153) has joined #minecraft
[4:20] <TrueWolves> This could work with most sandwichs as long as they have 2 bread + 1 ham + 2 other ingredents.
[4:20] <muddtusk> TheCactusMan, it is related to precipitation
[4:20] <OODavo> I don't think there are tomatoes yet.
[4:20] <TrueWolves> There isn't
[4:20] <TheCactusman> k.
[4:20] <TrueWolves> This is an item idea.
[4:20] <Clearbrook> yea
[4:20] <Clearbrook> yet*
[4:20] * laCour is now known as Guest756643039
[4:20] * Guest756643039 is now known as laCour
[4:20] <OODavo> That would be pretty awesome.
[4:20] <TrueWolves> There isn't chease yet.
[4:20] <OODavo> More stuff to farm would be great.
[4:20] <Clearbrook> if you let tomatoes sit out, they will rot
[4:20] <OODavo> But there's milk, which will almost certainly become cheese.
[4:20] * laCour is now known as Guest756643040
[4:20] * Guest756643040 is now known as laCour
[4:21] <TrueWolves> That's the point of this, improve farms, and make a craftable food that's helpful.

[4:21] <TrueWolves> It's not space efficentent, but 8 hearts to a single inventory slot = useful.

[4:21] * Guest756643042 is now known as laCour

[4:21] * Guest756643043 is now known as laCour

[4:24] <TrueWolves> unless you mean SMP, which only has a test server no one has a chance of getting in anyway.
[4:24] <lastwill11> then why cant i connect
[4:24] <Cypher100> some kick this guy for spamming nick changes

[4:29] <TheCactusman> Merciless, I know :) Finished the game when I was 9. Loved it like a brother :D
[4:29] <OODavo> The seecret Friday update is not SMP. :P
[4:29] <Merciless> thecactus man, this though is my fav
[4:29] <OODavo> You couldn't possibly do SMP seecretly.
[4:29] <Merciless> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGx0oXgE6wQ
[4:29] <Helar> smp is already here :D
[4:29] <Helar> kind of'
[4:29] <OODavo> We just need servers, yeah.
[4:29] <Clearbrook> smp is in alpha
[4:29] <TheCactusman> ah, ok.
[4:29] <Ronjoe> according to twitter, this update includes powered minecarts
[4:30] <OODavo> But SSP is in alpha too.
[4:30] <Clearbrook> yea but it's like super-alpha
[4:30] <OODavo> SUPER-ALPHA!
[4:30] <OODavo> That would be beta.
[4:30] <Clearbrook> anti-ultimate
[4:30] <Cypher100> Notch you should tell us when u turn on SMP, so us IRC users can connect first
[4:30] <Raijouta> DOUBLE ALPHA

[4:31] <Clearbrook> that wouldn't help me since my internet time it so irregular

[4:31] <Ronjoe> this irc is too wild
[4:31] <lastwill11> man it sucks to live here because i get the update on Saterday

[4:34] <lastwill11> and now hes left
[4:35] <cynicalAlchemist> As you guys noticed that my name is made of 2 words, as well as the password for Minecraft. Well, to show my happiness for SMP. I'm going to make my handle the same as the password.
[4:35] <Roy> TS has lower sound quality

[4:35] <Roy> Well, I always stick to vent :P
[4:35] <Kin> Notch is awesome, but I doubt he can program at the speed he does, while debugging, and talking on IRC to 284 people :P
[4:35] <OODavo> What does TS stand for? :/
[4:35] <LG_Legacy> TS allows free 512 slots
[4:35] <Roy> Teamspeak
[4:35] <LG_Legacy> Teamspeak
[4:35] <Roy> Jynx
[4:36] <OODavo> Oh, right.
[4:36] <xjiro> that's wrong LG_Legacy
[4:36] <hassifa> you would be surprised at what multiple screens can do kin
[4:36] <LG_Legacy> Technically speaking yes xjiro
[4:36] <xjiro> no one's been able to get more than the default out of it, which is like 12 or something so far
[4:36] <lastwill11> or having multiple hands
[4:36] <Kin> -_-; I have 3 screens.
[4:36] <Clearbrook> I'd go up on ts, but all my mics are broken

[4:37] <xjiro> yes, yes you can.
[4:37] <xjiro> and they give you a license that prints 512 on screen
[4:37] <xjiro> then doesn't work for more than some very low number that no one can surpass

[4:46] <Perry> It's so simple. Click the ball to change it's color. Do it. You'll never ever do anything else again.
[4:46] <OODavo> That game's WAY too easy.
[4:47] <FFT> lol
[4:47] <Kizzycocoa> oh, notch is on
[4:47] <FFT> about as mutch is accomplished as any other game
[4:47] <Perry> mutch
[4:47] <Kizzycocoa> surely, he can estimate the time left until the update is out?
[4:47] <Kizzycocoa> :P
[4:47] <Anoniempje> 12h
[4:47] <OODavo> A while.
[4:47] <Shrub> Baaaaaaaaaack
[4:47] <lastwill11> too zeay
[4:48] <OODavo> Actually, no, that game accomplishes far less than, say, Minecraft.
[4:48] <ChJees> Perry, virtual Jojo
[4:48] <TrueWolves> Just a fair warning
[4:48] <Shrub> TW that was a fairly cool game
[4:48] * lastwill11 crys (sad song playing)
[4:48] <TrueWolves> I might kick the next few people who say they want the update out now, as it doesn't contribute to chat and is annoying. Let work get done and all that.
[4:48] <ChJees> I hope i will be able to do something awesome with gold today :P
[4:48] <OODavo> I want the update out eventually. :P
[4:48] <TrueWolves> Have you encountered the "non-linear" story yet Shrub?
[4:48] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Hmm I wonder what the next monster will be
[4:49] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> And if bosses will be made
[4:49] <Shrub> No
[4:49] <Shrub> I got up to Sector 4
[4:49] * TrueWolves nods
[4:49] <TrueWolves> Did you fight the first boss or get by him?
[4:49] <Shrub> You can get by him?
[4:49] <TrueWolves> haha
[4:49] <ZarroTsu[sleep]> hey guys Notch updated his blog, and-- *trampled to death*
[4:49] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> What game?

[4:49] <TrueWolves> Shrub, the levels are the same, the goals are (mostly) the same.
[4:49] <Clearbrook> iji is fun
[4:50] <FFT> iji was a great game
[4:50] <TrueWolves> the only thing that changes is the story behind the actions based on how much you kill.
[4:50] <Shrub> It felt like Duke Nukem
[4:50] <TrueWolves> I wouldn't call that a non linear story line.
[4:50] <Shrub> I would
[4:50] <TrueWolves> The first boss will always die (just not always by your hand)

[4:51] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Same lastwill
[4:52] <Inverness> because /v/ talks about it all the time
[4:52] <Kizzycocoa> I think mechanised minecarts is the update. according to his twitter at least
[4:52] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> I find it in a Let's Play video
[4:52] <ChJees> I found Minecraft through Wurm Online :P
[4:52] <OODavo> Because it was linked on TV Tropes.
[4:52] <Clearbrook> minecraft is being talked about everywhere
[4:52] * Inverness is hoping for handcars

[5:10] <Cintiq> ok
[5:10] <Cintiq> kokiri forest failed.
[5:10] <cynicalAlchemist> Also, they should bring it out that you can grind flower's pigments into ink and then craft a feather into a pen.
[5:10] <Cintiq> miserabally
[5:10] <OODavo> Game balance.
[5:10] <TrueWolves> I plan to set up a system that will make this channel a lot scriter
[5:10] <Shrub> :(
[5:10] <Twangy> Because constantly right clicking instant win
[5:10] <Inverness> Skizomeuh, I agree with that
[5:10] <TrueWolves> the IRCops are already not to happy with this place at times.
[5:10] <Clearbrook> Maybe sandwiches could be stackable?
[5:10] <xjiro> stackable food is dumb
[5:10] <OODavo> define:scriter
[5:10] <Shrub> Cynic, that's not a bad idea
[5:10] <Cintiq> TrueWolves, why's that?
[5:10] <Inverness> Twangy, then make a cool-down
[5:10] <IDTL> Okay two word suggestion. pet slime
[5:10] <Learner0> How about with certain foods
[5:10] <TrueWolves> stricter*
[5:10] <xjiro> it's literally a mechanic that healing items can't be stacked
[5:10] <Learner0> you can stack them
[5:10] <xjiro> that is obvious
[5:11] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Also why don't you have OP status in here anymore truewolves?
[5:11] <Learner0> aka stackable sandwiches in stacks of 2
[5:11] <Shrub> Maybe Food can't be stacked in your bottom bar
[5:11] <RavenBurga> O.5 word suggestions
[5:11] <Learner0> or 3
[5:11] <cynicalAlchemist> I got the idea from the large feather I found.
[5:11] <TrueWolves> Becuase I don't need it.
[5:11] <Shrub> but in your inventory it can
[5:11] <Shrub> and chests
[5:11] <RavenBurga> Po-
[5:11] <Learner0> good idea shrub
[5:11] <TrueWolves> I can prove how I don't need it if someone gives me just a good enough reason to kick.
[5:11] <Inverness> Oh well, I still want some sort of tool that can be used to climb up walls
[5:11] <Shrub> :$
[5:11] <Learner0> but its not going up to 64
[5:11] <Shrub> No
[5:11] <Shrub> just like 8 or something
[5:11] <Clearbrook> I want to see a way that items get moved to the bottom part of the inventory when something runs out

[5:11] <Shrub> for organisational purposes
[5:11] <Learner0> like snowballs
[5:11] <Fantafuzz> Yup
[5:11] <Learner0> keep them at a low number
[5:11] <Clearbrook> like if you click a blank spot, it adds an arrow
[5:11] <Cintiq> i never got snowballs
[5:11] <IDTL> Guys, update speculation time!
[5:12] <Cintiq> you craft them

[5:12] <OODavo> Why can't you stack ladders? They're smaller than blocks by far...
[5:12] <Inverness> Raijouta, >:(

[5:13] <RavenBurga> Oh'z
[5:13] <Shrub> That's a meme?
[5:13] <Skizomeuh> xjiro why ? Let torches don't stack then...
[5:13] <Clearbrook> TrueWolves: sorry I started that D:
[5:13] <Shrub> I thought it was just people being weird O.o
[5:14] <xjiro> because torches arent a combat tactic

[5:14] <xjiro> isn't it clear that healing items don't stack so you can't heal like they're stacked ?
[5:14] <Skizomeuh> xjiro : you're right, capping @ 16 or less, what do you think ?
[5:14] <Learner0> we already have dirt and blocks
[5:14] <ChJees> Minecraft with Quickheal button?
[5:14] <xjiro> ridiculous
[5:14] <AndrewPH> some sort of device that breaks the game
[5:14] <IDTL> putting a sign on a cactus crashes the game

[5:16] <Skizomeuh> Leaning... Why not ! Would be helpful to make bridges
[5:16] * RavenBurga was kicked from #minecraft by TrueWolves

[5:23] <Skizomeuh> Cintiq : Yeah ! Great challenges ahead ! I'm curious to see how Portal & HL2EP3 scenarios will blend
[5:23] <cynicalAlchemist> My idea is that you can attach the rope to something (iron piston, maybe?) and then somehow to yourself so you can stop yourself from falling if you walk way to close to the edge.

[5:25] <OODavo> Shouldn't that be Alt?
[5:25] <Learner0> I would have the rope ladder hang in midair
[5:25] <OODavo> Shift is the sprint key, normally.
[5:25] <Learner0> as long as it connects to something above it
[5:25] <Clearbrook> ctrl is nrml crouch

[5:25] <OODavo> Ctrl = crouch, Shift = sprint, Alt = walk
[5:25] <OODavo> That's how it is in HL2, anyway.
[5:25] <Trolololo> sprint is not needed
[5:26] * Shrub (poop@121.216.199.34) has joined #minecraft
[5:26] <Trolololo> otherwise its just a sprint spam when anyones walking around
[5:26] <ZomBuster> sprint key is no fun

[5:26] * Alram (Marla@fabe.xs4all.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[5:26] <OODavo> Sprint generally has a limited meter.
[5:26] <Clearbrook> no stamina bars
[5:26] <Trolololo> the limited meter on sprint is what makes it annoying
[5:26] <Trolololo> you continually feel limited
[5:27] <OODavo> Hmm.
[5:27] <Clearbrook> how about a dash?

[5:27] <Clearbrook> sudden speed boost, no control
[5:27] <ZomBuster> slime + boots = sticky shoes for climbing
[5:27] <TrueWolves> what you do is you make the normal pace decent so a limited dash bar doesn't seem needed for travel, just escape.
[5:27] <OODavo> Perhaps once hunger is implemented, you get hungrier when sprinting? :/
[5:27] * IceGuest_75 (IceChat7@0x4dd5c701.adsl.cybercity.dk) has joined #minecraft
[5:27] <IDTL> hunger will probably never be implemented
[5:27] <Skizomeuh> Let's have the sprint stackable ! \o/
[5:27] <IDTL> notch said he didn't like the idea
[5:27] <Trolololo> hunger will probably never be implemented
[5:27] <Trolololo> OH GOD
[5:28] <Clearbrook> it should never be
[5:28] <IDTL> there could be some "hardcore" mode, where you have to eat and drink and stuff
[5:28] <Skizomeuh> Hunger in games kills the fun
[5:28] <IDTL> and other stuff
[5:28] <OODavo> It's Survival. There should be some sort of meter like that.
[5:28] <Clearbrook> lets never speak of this hunger again
[5:28] <OODavo> Most games in the Survival genre have that stuff.
[5:28] <Banger> a block cut in half diagonaly
[5:28] <OODavo> Maybe a thirst meter instead, or something. I don't know! :P
[5:28] <OODavo> Diagonally? :/
[5:28] <Skizomeuh> Having it doesn't make them good
[5:28] <Clearbrook> so you want to be punished for playing the game?
[5:28] <Banger> yes

[5:29] <OODavo> It's not a punishment, it's an incentive to leave one's base. :P
[5:29] <Banger> Trolololo that too
[5:29] <TheCactusman> It would be like a stair block that doesn't speed you up.

[5:33] <TheCactusman> Hi ez :D
[5:33] <ez> hi Demki
[5:33] <Clearbrook> I think hunger in general is dumb
[5:33] <OODavo> Okay, make it you can't actually die from lack of sustenance, but you're penalised somehow.

[5:40] <Learner0> you get an anti-box

[6:06] <Hunter712> Minecraft needs some sort of stone that glows at a larger range than regular torches, would be cool to place around and replace normal torches with :v

[6:09] <IDTL> hoo boy am i tired
[6:09] <Kokopure> ez, did you see them at the zoo?
[6:09] <Inverness> LOL, I just thought to myself, I was going to lay more tracks in preparation for powered minecarts. The instant I thought of that, I heard a train whistle outside
[6:09] <Hunter712> He liked my idea of 'Dragon scale'
[6:09] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> ez are you in the UK?
[6:09] <ez> Kokopure: I saw them in the wild
[6:09] <Hunter712> Responded with "Hmm, dragon scale, I like that!"
[6:09] <ez> nope FlyingOvenOfDoom
[6:09] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Shame.

[6:12] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Epic tank is epic

[6:12] <Jest3r> What's this new kind of rock?
[6:12] <IDTL> :o
[6:12] <Jest3r> Some sort of gravel?
[6:12] <IDTL> Clay
[6:12] <Clearbrook> Clay?
[6:13] <Jest3r> No it's probably old.
[6:13] <cornelius> now, explain how a white rainbow can occur.
[6:13] <IDTL> Gravel
[6:13] <Jest3r> Righto.
[6:13] <cornelius> using logic.
[6:13] <cornelius> please.
[6:13] <ez> we had a teenager with a stick protecting us tho, very reinsuring lol
[6:13] <Demki> ez: whaty?
[6:13] <Demki> what?*
[6:13] <IDTL> Oh well then you had nothing to worry
[6:13] <Clearbrook> The moons white glow added to the rainbow color
[6:13] <cornelius> LOL
[6:13] <ez> from the Komodo Dragons, the guide had a stick :P
[6:13] <cornelius> that makes no sense.
[6:13] <cornelius> light doesn't work like that.
[6:13] <ez> lol
[6:13] <JamesK89> ITT: Internet moteorologists
[6:13] <RyMan> cornelius: Well if you don't see a rainbow, then you're seeing a white rainbow
[6:14] <ez> this is all true btw
[6:14] <Trolololo> oh yes rendering engine upgrades!
[6:14] <RyMan> Sort of
[6:14] <JamesK89> Lets go ask /sci/!
[6:14] <Demki> Anyway, ez: Do some logichex
[6:14] <IDTL> what if you put a black pastel crayon on someone's windshield wiper
[6:14] <geraldbrent> guide needs a sawn off 12 guage
[6:14] <Clearbrook> yea, lights mix when two of different wavelengths go the same way!
[6:14] <IDTL> and then they turned it on
[6:14] <ez> right away Demki
[6:14] <ez> (not)
[6:14] <Demki> XD
[6:14] <cornelius> :/
[6:14] <ez> :P
[6:14] <Demki> =|
[6:14] <Clearbrook> you get something in bewteen those colors
[6:14] <CyborgDragon> cornelius: working on that answer as we speak
[6:14] <Clearbrook> :\
[6:14] <cornelius> No dude, you don't.
[6:15] <cornelius> thats not how light works.
[6:15] <Clearbrook> Let me say it like this
[6:15] <CyborgDragon> lunar rainbows go by various names: moonbow, white rainbow, lunar bar
[6:15] <ez> Komodo Dragions are BIG
[6:15] <cornelius> jeezus christ, are you american or something?
[6:15] <Westsidergw> -.. . .-- . ... - -.-- .... . .-.. ---
[6:15] <ez> almost as big as the sharks we saw :P
[6:15] <Clearbrook> When the light is refracted into a rainbow, some parts of the light ARN'T refracted
[6:15] <CyborgDragon> it's not really white cornelius
[6:15] <Kaira-> ... what's going on?
[6:15] <IDTL> #Minecraft, where we talk about everything but Minecraft!
[6:15] <CyborgDragon> but the defraction is so little

[6:15] <Clearbrook> But we don't notice that since it's what we normally see
[6:16] <RyMan> cornelius: every last one of us? right?
[6:16] <IDTL> All I know is that Minecraft has a severe lack of top hats
[6:16] <cornelius> no CyborgDragon, where is the documented reporting of this phenomenon?
[6:16] <CyborgDragon> It is difficult for the human eye to discern colors in a moonbow because the light is usually too faint to excite the cone color receptors in human eyes.
[6:16] <cornelius> right.
[6:16] <Clearbrook> Yea can we atleast get taller hats?
[6:16] <CyborgDragon> documented?
[6:16] <cornelius> :/
[6:16] <CyborgDragon> right
[6:16] <CyborgDragon> let me get that for you
[6:16] <cornelius> Evidence, wikipedia articles etc.
[6:16] <CyborgDragon> right now
[6:16] <ez> cornelius: be nice =)
[6:16] <Jest3r> Can we do anything with crafting?
[6:16] <RaidSoft> cornelius: where is your documented proof of it NOT being true?
[6:17] <CyborgDragon> well first: here's the moonbow wikipedia page
[6:17] <RaidSoft> :P
[6:17] <CyborgDragon> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonbow
[6:17] <IDTL> Nope crafting's completly useless
[6:17] <Clearbrook> cornelius: The moon is reflecting the suns light right?
[6:17] <RyMan> cornelius: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=white+rainbow
[6:17] <CyborgDragon> read that, shut the hell up, and eat your own words
[6:17] <cornelius> are they white?
[6:17] <cornelius> idiot.
[6:17] <IDTL> Oh you guys.
[6:17] <CyborgDragon> they are not white, but they appear white to the human eye
[6:17] <ez> STOP IT cornelius
[6:17] <cornelius> You said there are white rainbows.
[6:17] <Clearbrook> so it goes without saying there is less light coming from the moon then the sun
[6:17] <cornelius> fine.
[6:17] <Clearbrook> yes
[6:17] <CyborgDragon> white light isnt really white either
[6:17] <Clearbrook> White + rainbow
[6:17] <CyborgDragon> it's a combination of colors

[6:24] <cornelius> so
[6:24] <Westsidergw> I loved the slime minecart vid.
[6:24] <cornelius> "BIGJam starts next week. I will release the SMP server before I leave for that. It might be buggy, but I promise to fix it when I get back. It will be missing mobs.

[6:24] <cornelius> friday update SMP?
[6:24] <CyborgDragon> doubt it
[6:24] <Westsidergw> Because of that post I'm hoping today's update includes binaries for SMB.

[6:27] <vede> Crying is God.
[6:27] <CyborgDragon> i have 3 large chests
[6:27] <IDTL> There should be a VERY rare Notch mob, that's a very powerful boss
[6:27] <CyborgDragon> full of cobblestone
[6:27] <CyborgDragon> WAT DO
[6:27] <cynicalAlchemist> Remain strong brothers! It will be here soon enough
[6:27] <IDTL> he would drop a single arrow upon death
[6:27] <CyborgDragon> and i have more cobblestone in my inventory
[6:27] <Kokopure> CyborgDragon, make halfsteps
[6:27] <mib_oqi1vl> Notch said he'll release the SMP alpha before he goes to the Berlin Indie Games thing, and that is tomorrow which means he'll release SMP alpha today? :D
[6:27] <RaidSoft> lol a gigantic notch roaming the landscape, squashing everything
[6:27] <CyborgDragon> koko, half steps are a 1:1 ratio D:
[6:27] <Westsidergw> I thought indie thing was on the 6th?
[6:27] <Kokopure> :|
[6:27] <Kokopure> then..
[6:27] <Learner0> IDTL!!
[6:27] <IDTL> Yo
[6:27] <Kokopure> make stairs
[6:27] <Learner0> I HAD THAT IDEA!
[6:28] <Learner0> HOW DARE YOU STEAL IT
[6:28] <IDTL> wat
[6:28] <CyborgDragon> koko, i have no need for stairs
[6:28] <Learner0> I said a rare Notch mob
[6:28] <hassifa> time for sleep, and hopefully smp will be released when i wake up in 6 hours
[6:28] <Kokopure> CyborgDragon, then whatever
[6:28] <IDTL> Man I don't have time for this drama, I am going to make me some french toast
[6:28] <Kokopure> make smooth stone in your furnace
[6:28] <Inverness> hm
[6:28] <Learner0> that would turn anything that tried to attack it into coding
[6:28] <WolfY5K> then destroy is CyborgDragon
[6:28] <Kokopure> always gotta use for smooth stone
[6:28] <CyborgDragon> but that'd just waste my coal
[6:28] <Kokopure> then make more furnaces
[6:28] <IDTL> lol coding, genius
[6:28] <CyborgDragon> turning 3 large chests of cobblestone into stone
[6:28] <Kokopure> if you have eight full stacks
[6:28] <mib_oqi1vl> <Westsidergw>: I thought indie thing was on the 6th?
[6:28] <mib_oqi1vl> oh snap
[6:28] <Kokopure> you can make 64 furnaces
[6:28] <mib_oqi1vl> you're right, I read somewhere it was the 31st..
[6:29] <Ominus> rare notch mob,he should drop a single nuke upon death and the nuke should detonate and your world should be deleted for awesome purposes
[6:29] <CyborgDragon> and i cant expand my furnace room
[6:29] <Kokopure> make a village around your castle.
[6:29] <Westsidergw> He didn't say it would be the day before he left though. He just said BEFORE I LEAVE.
[6:29] <Kokopure> give each house a furnace.
[6:29] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Silly ominus
[6:29] <CyborgDragon> no castle, underground base
[6:29] <mib_oqi1vl> true
[6:29] <Westsidergw> Could still be in this update.
[6:29] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Its a nuke you send to other peoples worlds
[6:29] <IDTL> build a house out of furnaces
[6:29] <mib_oqi1vl> I really want a seecret update though :P
[6:29] <mib_oqi1vl> and SMP :P
[6:29] <IDTL> there should be prison bars as a glass replacement, maybe water could flow through them too
[6:29] <mib_oqi1vl> yeah, iron bars would be nice
[6:30] <IDTL> err, optional glass-like thing
[6:30] <Ominus> i wants the loadable minecarts back :(
[6:30] <CyborgDragon> idtl, notch has said he'll make toggleable flood gates and trap doors
[6:30] <Westsidergw> I still want trap doors.
[6:30] <Westsidergw> I cant make a door down.
[6:30] <CyborgDragon> TOGGLEABLE FLOOD GATES

[6:31] <Kokopure> I've heard the same thing
[6:31] <Kokopure> I've heard a growl that i couldn't give to any mob
[6:31] <IDTL> although those cave sounds are mighty terrifying
[6:31] <Kokopure> but I only heard it once

[6:33] <Ominus> lol
[6:34] <Westsidergw> They get updated usually around 2-3AM my time.

[6:36] <Westsidergw> I'm in the US Navy.. I know how. I still dislike it.
[6:37] <Kokopure> I think we should use a ten-hour clock :|
[6:37] <Westsidergw> I'm on leave.. its heavenly to not have to use 24-hr time.
[6:37] <Kokopure> like the French did during the revolution
[6:37] <Koramei> it was stupid
[6:37] <Westsidergw> On ship we hardly use it though. All the clocks on-board are 12-hour.
[6:37] <Kokopure> Metric time makes so much more sense

[6:38] <Koramei> we'd be waking up in the middle of the night because it would just rotate
[6:38] <Ominus> discussions are relative

[6:39] * AndrewPH is now known as AndrewPH|AFK
[6:39] <copyboy> Westsidergw: why?
[6:39] <Skyl3lazer> hey dummies 24 hours clocks has nothing to do with sense, it's 360/15 since there's 360 degrees in a circle and horizon to horizon is 15 degrees
[6:39] <Koramei> 24 has been and will continue to be unless humanity becomes entrenched in space or something because it makes the most sense
[6:39] <Westsidergw> Idk. I can't find it useful if I don't use it.
[6:39] <copyboy> why should some random number make sense?

[6:40] <RyMan> Heh, discussing time to pass time
[6:40] <TheCactusman> retarded*
[6:40] <Koramei> it would you'd just have to divide the minute by 3
[6:40] <Westsidergw> Apple is lame no matter HOW you look at it.

[6:42] <Koramei> usually adminium though
[6:42] <TheCactusman> I sorted the adminium argument ages ago. I call it Pony Block to irritate people.

[6:42] <MatthiasVance> Also, I probably hit a map boundary then.

[6:43] <vede> Usually unless Notch says something really explicit like "The official name is THIS!" you can be pretty safe assuming that what he just called something, he won't necessarily consistently call it.
[6:43] <Skyl3lazer> uh no it's adamantite clearly
[6:43] <Helar> aspergite
[6:43] <Skyl3lazer> adamantite is the unbreakable metal in fantasy worlds what else would it be
[6:43] <Ominus> no its a boobie trap block
[6:43] <Westsidergw> Are you guys talking about Obsidian?
[6:43] <copyboy> blackrock
[6:43] <Koramei> op block
[6:43] <vede> ie. "I placed adminium, but this other guy came over and walked on it and I was like dude get off my opsidian!"

[6:43] <Skizomeuh> Let's call it Deirdre

[6:44] <Ominus> names of things are relative
[6:44] <Koramei> no it isn't :|
[6:44] <geraldbrent> lets call it blackshit
[6:44] <Ominus> to the person caling them
[6:44] <vede> Blackstone.
[6:44] <Westsidergw> Lets call it Unobtanium.. and we'll all pirate that great movie Cameron-Avatar-DVDrip.avi.exe
[6:44] <vede> Like redstone.
[6:44] <Demki> it is adminium cause admins make it
[6:44] <Koramei> it's been adminium for like a year now
[6:44] <Koramei> it's what most people call it and that's not gonna change
[6:44] <geraldbrent> ikno im joking
[6:44] <Demki> It's been adminium for more than a year

[6:45] <popbob> it's bedrock you fools
[6:45] <Koramei> adminium is the most common
[6:45] <vede> I call it admin blocks because descriptive names are nice.
[6:45] <Koramei> by far
[6:45] <Ominus> the lizardmen are watching this chat and ROTFLing
[6:45] <RyMan> no votes for admintantanitetanium?

[6:45] <Koramei> I'm gonna pass on that
[6:45] <RyMan> xD
[6:45] <Kyto> adminium != obsidian
[6:45] <cynicalAlchemist> I wonder if notch is seeing this and enjoing the fact that we're going insane for an update.
[6:45] <Demki> I have been playing minecraft for over a year, and since the time I started playing MP(at the same day I started playing MC) I called it adminium
[6:45] <Demki> adminium was before obsidian
[6:45] * PandaBear is back from: Picking the veg
[6:46] <Koramei> as I said Demki...
[6:46] <Koramei> it's always been adminium really
[6:46] <Kyto> they look totally different
[6:46] <Koramei> don't argue about it now :p
[6:46] <vede> Westsidergw, Avatar using the term "unobtanium" was such a dick move.
[6:46] <Skyl3lazer> well you're dumb then since it adamantite
[6:46] <Koramei> far more important things to be concerned about
[6:46] <Demki> But I called it adminium cause that's what I came up with
[6:46] <Demki> XD
[6:46] <Westsidergw> i lol'd
[6:46] <vede> Especially since it decided to go and be POPULAR.
[6:46] <Koramei> adamanTINE is the correct term for a start and it isn't that
[6:46] <RyMan> hrm, perhaps i'll just go to sleep and wait it out like that...

[6:46] <vede> So now anyone who uses "unobtanium" will have a fuckton of people accusing them of ripping off Avatar.
[6:47] <vede> Or referencing it or whatever.
[6:47] <Koramei> unobtanium is a real term
[6:47] <RyMan> unobtanium has been around long before avatar
[6:47] <vede> I know.
[6:47] <Koramei> an unobtanable mineral
[6:47] <Koramei> if you know why are you saying that
[6:47] <Koramei> you clearly didn't know
[6:47] <vede> But *it's not supposed to be used in-universe*!
[6:47] <RyMan> a non existant material really
[6:47] <Koramei> mm
[6:47] <Koramei> can just be one that's hard to get
[6:47] <Koramei> e.g. oil that's way too far down to be cost effective is unobtanium iirc
[6:48] <RyMan> then it wouldn't be unobtainable though
[6:48] <vede> <Koramei> you clearly didn't know <-- You weren't talking about be, right?
[6:48] <Koramei> yes I was
[6:48] <Banger> geraldbrent where u from?
[6:48] <vede> Um, can you read?
[6:48] <RyMan> personally when i think unobtanium, i think super metals that just don't exist

[6:49] <Koramei> why are we talking about this
[6:49] <Drakkar> nothing better to talk about

[6:49] <RyMan> Well it's not like we have an update to talk about
[6:49] <Drakkar> dance puppets dance

[6:50] <RyMan> I can't wait =)
[6:50] <Drakkar> unless powered minecarts are actually made seperate
[6:50] <Koramei> I'll be fine with it however he does it really

[7:09] <Jest3r> Some low pitches growl ish noise
[7:10] <thelinx> I look up towards the rigth
[7:10] <thelinx> and there are torches

[7:13] <Horrible> you can fullscreen in both the Web and the dl client
[7:13] <AlphaGunman> one of the F keys was fullscreen
[7:13] <Horrible> just start the game and hit f11
[7:13] <AlphaGunman> yeah
[7:13] <JamesK89> I already own MineCraft, but it seems like there needs to be a formal demo of Alpha for people new to MC.
[7:13] <AlphaGunman> f11.
[7:13] <Hogofwar> there is a greasemonky script that can get the in broswer aplha fullscreen
[7:13] <Skizomeuh> Is it possible to remove the debug info text displayed on top left corner ?

[7:13] <AlphaGunman> hogofwar, not needed
[7:13] <Samlock> Don't need a demo, people should know it's worth every penny
[7:13] <Zortty> Is the Alpha worth buying?
[7:13] <RyMan> Bring on the 3D Anaglyph!
[7:13] <Horrible> SKiz: turn it off in the options menu
[7:13] <AlphaGunman> Zortty, yes
[7:13] <Samlock> Well worth buying yes Zortty
[7:13] <Zortty> I only played for one day
[7:13] <RyMan> Zortty: Abso-freaking-lutely
[7:13] <Westsidergw> yes
[7:14] <JamesK89> Its penny worth every.
[7:14] <Mithril> JamesK89 , I think its better to focus on getting the game in beta first
[7:14] <thelinx> f11 didn't work
[7:14] <Zortty> But really am addicted already haha
[7:14] <AlphaGunman> Creative <<<< Alpha
[7:14] <thelinx> it did something and then it regressed
[7:14] <AlphaGunman> IMO

[7:14] <Toadbert> once it has all of alphas new features

[7:14] <AlphaGunman> copyboy
[7:14] <Horrible> That should turn the other stuff of too, I think.
[7:14] <McCloud> I kinda think the free stuff available is demo enough
[7:14] <RyMan> Zortty: If you like creative, pop into the survival test for classic to get a very small taste of what alpha is like
[7:14] <AlphaGunman> yes, Alpha >>>>> Creative
[7:14] <Rooster> Alpha should definetly have some of single player trial or demp.
[7:14] <McCloud> you want more content, buy the game
[7:15] <Hogofwar> why the hell is my sand on fire
[7:15] <Toadbert> ITS POSESSED

[7:15] <AlphaGunman> rooster, like what
[7:15] <AlphaGunman> what kind of demo
[7:15] <Rooster> Buh uh
[7:15] <copyboy> depends, if someone likes creative more than alpha, there's nothing wrong with it
[7:15] <JamesK89> Well like someone said, perhaps it'd be better to wait for a demo for when beta comes out.
[7:15] <IDTL> is the 3D anaglyph still "broken"?
[7:15] <Zortty> How do I do that RyMan, I am still working my way around
[7:15] <copyboy> it's two different gamemodes
[7:15] <Hogofwar> Also, when sand goes on fire maybe the sand should turn into glass?
[7:15] <Zombii> Oh god, all I can think about is finally having a completed roller coaster
[7:15] <AlphaGunman> I think the old survival test was removed?
[7:15] <thelinx> can mobs open doors and/or activate pressure plates?
[7:15] <RyMan> Zortty: http://minecraft.net/survivaltest/
[7:15] <Zombii> no linx
[7:15] <Zortty> Thank you Sir
[7:15] <thelinx> Zombii: well that's a relief
[7:15] <RyMan> No problem
[7:15] <Zombii> yeah
[7:16] <AlphaGunman> Pretty sure mobs can activate pressure plates..
[7:16] <Zombii> if creepers could open your doors
[7:16] <Toadbert> they can
[7:16] <Zombii> oh shit
[7:16] <RyMan> AlphaGunman: They can
[7:16] <Zombii> i thought they couldn't
[7:16] <Zombii> SHIT
[7:16] <Toadbert> lol
[7:16] <Zombii> BRB DELETING PLATES
[7:16] <McCloud> not more gun powder
[7:16] <Kokopure> mobs can totally activate pressure plates O_o
[7:16] <RyMan> Use buttons or levers if you don't want a mob to use something
[7:16] <Kokopure> otherwise traps would be useless
[7:16] <Hogofwar> I can fight fire with mah axe!
[7:16] <AlphaGunman> thought so
[7:16] <RyMan> Or reverse a plate so if something is on it, it closes the door
[7:16] * hruhf (Mibbit@kitten.dotneko.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:16] <Samlock> I thought mobs could only activate wooden plates?
[7:16] <Rooster> Who's ready to use C4 abuse EVERYWHERE.

[7:17] <Kokopure> I mean
[7:17] <Kokopure> the part of it that you live in
[7:17] <Kokopure> what I mean is
[7:17] <Zortty> What is the aim of it?
[7:17] <Zombii> well
[7:17] <Samlock> Hogofwar - just printscreen and crop in paint
[7:17] <Zombii> uh
[7:17] <Kokopure> if someone burns down your tree
[7:17] <McCloud> does print screen not work?
[7:18] <copyboy> McCloud: like in that one gmod gamemode where you have to collect poo and piss?
[7:18] <Kokopure> do they burn down your house
[7:18] <Zombii> if someone burns down the tree
[7:18] <Zombii> yes
[7:18] <Zombii> my house burns
[7:18] <bfzzzz> hey, stupid question here... if you travel out from your main base and you get lost, how the hell do you find your way back

[7:18] * geraldbrent is away: WHY THE FUCK AM I AWAY
[7:18] <Zombii> except my furnaces
[7:18] <IDTL> I can't wait to go into someone's base, and put a pressure plate with tnt hidden in their flooring
[7:18] <Samlock> bfzzzz - make markers
[7:18] <IDTL> and watch from a distance
[7:18] <bfzzzz> i had to install cartographer and make all sorts of guesses, i felt like christopher colombus in reverse
[7:18] <Zombii> so like
[7:18] <AlphaGunman> IDTL
[7:18] <AlphaGunman> best idea
[7:18] <AlphaGunman> ever
[7:18] <Zombii> it'd burn
[7:18] <Zombii> and then
[7:18] * hruhf (Mibbit@kitten.dotneko.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[7:18] <Zombii> I'd come back from my mines

[7:18] <AlphaGunman> except you'd get banned :(
[7:18] <Zombii> floating furnaces
[7:18] <Zombii> and I'm like
[7:18] <Zombii> wtf
[7:18] <bfzzzz> i need to make a huge ass lava spire too maybe
[7:18] <IDTL> not if they didn't know it was me ;)
[7:18] <AlphaGunman> oh my god
[7:18] <AlphaGunman> idea
[7:18] <Samlock> Or if you're already lost, try using Cartographer and look for landmarks!
[7:18] <Mithril> Guys I just booted up minecraft and I had an update
[7:18] <AlphaGunman> remove someone's floor completely
[7:18] <Kokopure> am I the only one who thinks it's crazy that the number of sales in the past 24hrs is still going up?
[7:19] <Toadbert> thats nice
[7:19] <AlphaGunman> and the tile under it
[7:19] <AlphaGunman> replace with tnt
[7:19] <AlphaGunman> put floor back
[7:19] <Zombii> Nice try Mithril
[7:19] <AlphaGunman> wire to a lever far away

[7:20] <thelinx> oh shit, huge cave
[7:20] <TrueWolves> So you could set it on a table and the wires safely underground.
[7:20] <Zombii> I wish there wasn't a limit to how far the signal traveled
[7:20] <TrueWolves> and have the*
[7:20] <Mithril> Meh I got to work from 5 to 7 ,so I hope the update is here after work
[7:20] <Hogofwar> meh i'll just use fraps to take a screenshot
[7:20] <cryzed> > 305 people
[7:21] <cryzed> Boy, I remember when 140 was maximum
[7:21] <AlphaGunman> hogofwar
[7:21] <AlphaGunman> how about print screen?
[7:21] <Miek> he said he finished powered carts about 20 minutes ago, give him a chance :p
[7:21] <Hyst> we had 315 last night i think
[7:21] <cryzed> Hyst, not bad
[7:21] <Hogofwar> Fraps is easier
[7:21] <Mithril> Miek: Is that the only thing he finished?
[7:21] <Hyst> i hope we have some more hidden updates ^_^
[7:21] <TrueWolves> Zombii, if it powered 1 redstone dust 3 blocks away, it would power them all connected like normal. I just wish I didn't have to have a bit of dust touching the switch, it prevents me from putting a handy switch on a table.
[7:21] <cryzed> Hogofwar, fraps to take screenshot? Talk about choosing the wrong tool

[7:25] <Cintiq> CruelNoise, if zombies like bacon, certainly.
[7:25] <Leiche> 4. It may be that Valve wants to distribute Minecraft through Steam. What this would mean for current owners of the game though is anybody's guess. It also does not shed any light on whether or not the price of the game will go up beyond what was already expected to happen once the game's multiplayer Survival is released.
[7:25] <tacidsky> Anyone else have a problem where you died and now try to reload the game and your save won't let you respawn?
[7:25] <Leiche> :o
[7:25] <Hogofwar> But will ge say something?
[7:25] <Hunter712> Notch needs to add some sort of stone that glows at a larger range than regular torches
[7:25] <Notch> new mob, too
[7:26] <cynicalAlchemist> I'm not a zombie, I would like to think as myself as a creeper.
[7:26] <AlphaGunman> Notch, how are you?
[7:26] <Kokopure> WHAT
[7:26] <Leiche> bees ?
[7:26] <Kokopure> New mob??
[7:26] <Inverness> o.o

[7:26] <vede> Notch, have you seen the suggestions about bucketing slimes to death?
[7:26] <Hyst> OOH chickens?
[7:26] <Kokopure> or Neutral?
[7:26] <Hyst> :D
[7:26] <TrueWolves> ... friendly bees?
[7:26] <Toadbert> FRIENDLY MOB
[7:26] <Horrible> slimes should be fixed as the secret updaet. D:
[7:26] <guacamole> Fish?
[7:26] <JamesK89> *lanterns
[7:26] <Inverness> oh god

[7:26] <Inverness> Vuvuzelas
[7:26] <Drakkar> oh wow
[7:26] <Notch> and I'm kinda happy with the art. ;D It's extremely silly
[7:26] <Leiche> you know that the is a COW RITE
[7:26] <TrueWolves> chicken? fish?
[7:26] <Kokopure> oh Drakkar
[7:26] <Drakkar> bucketing slimes would be great
[7:26] <cynicalAlchemist> Guys, allow Notch to speak.
[7:26] <Lisimba> Chickens would be nice. Harvest feathers.
[7:26] <mib_4ghga2> smp
[7:26] <Hogofwar> WjAlready posted taht on facepunch
[7:26] <Inverness> DOOOO IIIT
[7:26] <mib_4ghga2> smp
[7:26] <lifeless> spam much
[7:26] <Toadbert> bucketing slimes lolo
[7:26] <Kokopure> Notch, can you make milk useful^_^?
[7:26] <CruelNoise> also, #minecraft has become far too crouded
[7:26] <Leiche> the cow already sounds like a moo-moozela
[7:26] <JamesK89> Oh lawd its Notch himself!
[7:26] <Hyst> but yeah fixing milk, adding a way to get string from sheep, would be so fun
[7:26] <CruelNoise> crowded*

[7:27] * JamesK89 bows and sacrifices his firstborn to Notch almighty
[7:27] <Leiche> so seriously
[7:27] <Cintiq> tbh there needs to be an invite only mc channel
[7:27] <Horrible> without the !.
[7:27] <cynicalAlchemist> Minecraft has become too popular for it's own good.
[7:27] <Cintiq> where all the 'OMEG NOTCH' people don't get invited
[7:27] <Cintiq> :/
[7:27] <Kokopure> friendly mawbs, oh boy <3
[7:27] <Cintiq> but that's just my opinion.
[7:27] <Zombii> Notch, when do you leave for your convention/music festival thing?
[7:27] <Toadbert> that would bar off part of the community
[7:27] <vede> It'd be cool if we were able to scoop up the smallest slimes in buckets, or bucket bigger slimes (reducing their size) and end up with a small slime in a bucket, Notch.
[7:27] <TrueWolves> I won't go to an invite only minecraft room unless Notch aproves of it.
[7:27] <Toadbert> YE CANT DO THAT
[7:27] <Notch> it's a game dev thing
[7:27] <joo> LOL just flooded my mine :')
[7:27] <Notch> I leave on thursday next week
[7:27] <Kokopure> vede, that would be so cool.
[7:27] <Toadbert> good work joo
[7:27] <Kokopure> I would be able to carry my pets around!
[7:27] <Kokopure> :D
[7:27] <RyMan> Notch: I hope you enjoy it
[7:27] <Quatroking> Notch, do you ever visit anime conventions
[7:27] <Westsidergw> BIGJam is on the 6th I think.
[7:27] <CruelNoise> bye notch
[7:27] <Notch> not yet, no
[7:27] <Hyst> smp public before thursday next week?
[7:27] <Quatroking> aww
[7:27] <Hyst> ILY notch
[7:27] <vede> Also, slimes acting differently after touching a liquid. Lava slime, water slime.
[7:27] <Hunter712> It would be cool to throw slime balls at enemies to slow them
[7:28] <Kokopure> ooh.
[7:28] <Drakkar> lava slimes would
[7:28] <Kokopure> slimes absorb properties of their liquid?
[7:28] <RyMan> Hunter712: Spiders right?
[7:28] <Drakkar> be devastating
[7:28] <Toadbert> am i horrible for smashing slimes into lava
[7:28] <Kokopure> I still would like to see lava light things on fire.
[7:28] <Drakkar> to say the least
[7:28] <Toadbert> just to watch them burst into 4
[7:28] <Horrible> PING.
[7:28] * Fisheatsbear (Fish@74.194.196.81) has joined #minecraft

[7:28] <Westsidergw> I've already got my dedicated server put in the rack and primed up. I just need server binaries.
[7:28] <Drakkar> doesn't lava light things on fire
[7:28] <Toadbert> and the burst into 4 again

[7:29] <Cintiq> i'm listening.
[7:29] <Inverness> "This text is hard to read if you play the game at the default resolution, but at 1080p it's fine!"

[7:29] <Hyst> anyone know how to make square brushes in photoshop?
[7:29] <Drakkar> being able to take some slime balls
[7:29] <TrueWolves> Drakkar, can I PM you something random?
[7:29] <Drakkar> stick em in your crafty thing
[7:29] <Cintiq> it's what this channel is supposed to be
[7:29] <Kokopure> and craft slimes??
[7:29] <Horrible> Funny, #minecraft is usually used for what #mcchatter is SUPPOSED to be used for.
[7:29] <Drakkar> and add a block core
[7:29] <Kokopure> hrmmm
[7:29] <Drakkar> so we can have terraforming slimes
[7:29] <Zackery> Redundant post: Dynamite Creepers.
[7:29] <Zombii> Notch, I didn't get into the SMP server, exactly how buggy is it? Is it playable, but just a little annoying at times, or just totally unplayable?
[7:29] <Kokopure> O.o
[7:29] <Drakkar> go for it TrueWolves
[7:29] <Kokopure> Terraforming slimes?
[7:29] <Pilk> Hyst: Define a new one from a square black canvas
[7:29] <Drakkar> yeah
[7:29] <Kokopure> what would that be like?
[7:30] <Hunter712> Meh, I highly doubt Notch would work with Valve, Notch likes working alone :D
[7:30] <Drakkar> they'd adjust the terrain as they wander around

[7:30] <Drakkar> they wouldn't leave them everywhere they go
[7:30] <Drakkar> but
[7:30] <lifeless> lol
[7:30] <Zombii> Also, Notch, when you updated the lighting system or whatever in that one update, my average FPS went down a LOT.

[7:31] <brorave> notch should buy blizzard
[7:31] <Leiche> it is not a limitation
[7:31] <Quatroking> Notch if you would have the money to buy valve, would you do so
[7:31] <Quatroking> brorave, lol no
[7:31] <Leiche> even a fucking flash game is on steam.
[7:31] <Drakkar> anyway
[7:31] <Hunter712> I highly doubt Notch would

[7:37] <Inverness> I hate when people do "1st" its like they have nothing better to do
[7:37] <thelinx> Notch should add some way to trade blocks and stuff with other players

[8:02] <Cial> i dont care if its compatible i just fucking hate steam
[8:02] <RyMan> Because I don't understand why Steam wouldn't be able to...
[8:02] <Krysonian> My interview with Notch is finished, it's going on www.iChan.org later today. http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=21298
[8:02] <Westsidergw> It can't be distributed through Steam.
[8:02] <Fisheatsbear> westside who cares that its java, valve would be stupid to not buy up rights to sell
[8:02] <khashai> Westsidergw: Though I am completely in the dark on Steam's distribution system, I would agree with others that I think that is a good idea, but only when it is out of beta.
[8:02] <Sr_creeper> Notch updated!
[8:02] <NJ> anyone got pics of anything in minecraft that notch built?
[8:02] <Sr_creeper> His blod was updated!

[8:04] <Dr_MadMan> So what is the deal with steam?
[8:04] <NJ> lol alpha
[8:04] <tacidsky> I'm on linux right now.
[8:04] <TrueWolves> Ok, this means stop talking about steam guys.
[8:04] <tacidsky> And OSX.
[8:04] <NJ> The new mob is totally a Notch
[8:04] <tacidsky> so I care.
[8:04] <JamesK89> Yeah! GNU Bros
[8:04] <vede> Outpost, everyone who uses Linux.
[8:04] <khashai> TrueWolves: It is obviously dragons. =)
[8:04] <Toadbert> a notch mob
[8:04] <Dr_MadMan> I think we will all get steam copys if it goes on steam
[8:04] <Roy> And yeah, steam is fine for some, and fail for others... it messes up on my comp a lot, dunno why
[8:05] <Westsidergw> If you own a game on Steam though.. you don't own the game.
[8:05] <Giacomand> I think Valve ported games to Mac because they could. If could port it to Linux then I'm sure they would've by now.
[8:05] <Toadbert> beg it for updates
[8:05] <muddtusk> Ok, TrueWolves. Hopefully summat that has some AI, maybe comes in groups
[8:05] <NJ> we're gonn have to fight off notches 24/7
[8:05] <Westsidergw> Legally they own it.
[8:05] <Outpost> vede: All five of them I suppose?
[8:05] <So_Useless> I hope it swims and is large.
[8:05] <TrueWolves> khashai, dragons are not a friendly mob
[8:05] <TrueWolves> and the kicking for steam starts now.
[8:05] <Skyl3lazer> patch is out
[8:05] <Sr_creeper> I think the friendly mob will prolly be a fellow minecrafter, they go out and fight monsters too.

[8:05] <Victator> Westsidergw: you never OWN a game. you own a COPY of a game
[8:06] <NJ> when suddenly
[8:06] <Westsidergw> Notch just said its updated now.. but I got no update :O?
[8:06] <NJ> HUGE CAVE
[8:06] <NJ> you cant see crap
[8:06] <Outpost> vede: I was doing it on purpose. I use Linux as well, but honestly it doesn't have a big enough base to get people to develope for it.
[8:06] <NJ> PLACE TORCHES,
[8:06] <NJ> OH GOD A DRAGON
[8:06] <Dr_MadMan> Your eyesight is crap

[8:06] <MikkoK> UPDATE JUST CAME OUT LOL
[8:06] <Toadbert> "place torches"
[8:06] <So_Useless> Hmm. Imagine worms. Huge worms that burrow underneath the surface of the map.
[8:06] <Ibutsu> Westsidergw: i saw one, it was quick
[8:06] <Toadbert> "theyll burn out anyway"
[8:06] <MikkoK> not really
[8:06] <Dr_MadMan> I want lanterns
[8:06] <Westsidergw> lbutsu I saw none.
[8:06] <NJ> I want mine caps
[8:06] <Westsidergw> ibutsu: I saw none.
[8:06] <Stenlay> Roy, he should drop Apples haha
[8:06] <Roy> :P
[8:07] <Giacomand> Notch is getting popular by the second. He has had three mentions already, two of them in a popular PC article and one in a popular game blog.
[8:07] <MikkoK> i want cars weapons and motorbikes and huge citys and planes etc
[8:07] <NJ> like, take an iron helmet and put it in crafting table
[8:07] <Sr_creeper> when notch is online, i hope he gives me a hug :3
[8:07] <MikkoK> oh this isnt #gta
[8:07] <TrueWolves> Notch is online, he's working.
[8:07] <vede> Outpost, people who think that are doing an awesome job at continuing the cycle whereby not enough people develop for Linux because not enough people use Linux because not enough people develop for Linux.
[8:07] <NJ> and put a torch on slot above iron helm
[8:07] <Giacomand> Soon he'll be so rich he can live only on the income of Minecraft.
[8:07] <So_Useless> Oh snap, the update is out.
[8:07] <Giacomand> Lies
[8:07] <joo> LINUXFTW
[8:07] <TrueWolves> Giacomand, he already does that.
[8:07] <Dr_MadMan> fuck rule #6
[8:07] <vede> Which is a terrible, stupid cycle, and perpetuating it is an awful thing to do.
[8:07] <Giacomand> He said he works part time
[8:07] <Sr_creeper> You all dont realise, notch spends all the money he gets from minecraft on ez.
[8:07] <TrueWolves> That was a long time ago Giacomand
[8:07] <Dr_MadMan> Comone notch!
[8:07] <Inverness> Notch works on Minecraft full-time now
[8:08] <Dr_MadMan> yep
[8:08] <TrueWolves> He's been working on just minecraft full time for months.
[8:08] <Hogofwar> I want meat to be able to stack
[8:08] <RyMan> Yeah...
[8:08] <So_Useless> Does that mean we are technically Notch's employers?
[8:08] <tacidsky> agreed Hogofwar
[8:08] <Giacomand> In his interview he said he worked part-time, and that was recent.
[8:08] <Link2006> WEll
[8:08] <khashai> As for Notch, and his money: Well, he deserves it. Simple as that.
[8:08] <MikkoK> who is that ez?

[8:08] <CruelNoise> ahh, that was nice
[8:08] <RyMan> Giacomand: Initially
[8:08] <Dr_MadMan> Notch's fiance
[8:08] <NJ> inb4 activision tries to buy out Minecraft
[8:08] <Roy> If food stacked, it would be too easy to spam selfheals
[8:08] <Giacomand> I doubt that Link
[8:08] <Stenlay> Mikkok, don't you know who ez is?
[8:08] <MikkoK> ah okay
[8:08] <muddtusk> Minefield?
[8:08] <tacidsky> Notch: Start stock.
[8:08] <shortyish> and firefox is slower than opera
[8:08] <Toadbert> we should all fly to sweeden
[8:08] <MikkoK> Stenlay: didnt know
[8:08] <Sr_creeper> Link2006 Thats how its always been
[8:08] <Outpost> vede: That cycles going to pretty much continue forever until Linux makes itself easy enough for the common-man. Keep in mind that if you know how to install an OS, you're no longer the common-man in this scenario.
[8:08] <Toadbert> and go to notchs house
[8:08] <Link2006> Giacomand: I just compared the two, They are
[8:08] <JamesK89> >herewegoagain.jpg
[8:08] <vede> More people develop for Linux -> more people use Linux -> more people develop for Linux until eventually the world comes to its collective senses and starts using Linux as a primary operating system.
[8:08] <MikkoK> bought minecraft last week

[8:12] <TrueWolves> take it out of the chat, anything I can do to make this chat slightly less crowded right now.
[8:12] <vede> Outpost, so not only are you suggesting the people shouldn't develop for Linux because people don't use Linux because people don't develop Linux, but you're ALSO saying that people shouldn't use Linux because OEMs don't ship with Linux because people don't use Linux.
[8:12] <RyMan> Dr_MadMan: I couldn't think of a line to continue that until now. The torches are NOW diamonds!
[8:12] <muddtusk> How do you guys feel about MC being less stable on linux as of late?

[8:17] <TrueWolves> I can only read some 250 words per minute, this chat is taxing.
[8:17] <Toadbert> why james

[8:36] <AlphaGunman> just because the engine evolved from that

[8:37] <Westsidergw> CruelNoise: Thats a QUAKE family tree. I'm talking about pre-quake. Its undoubtable that Quake used some of DooM's source.
[8:37] <AlphaGunman> quake -> quakeworld -> goldsrc -> source
[8:37] <Fisheatsbear> BATTLE ROYAL
[8:37] <AlphaGunman> not quake -> source
[8:37] <CruelNoise> Westsidergw: whatever, yu win
[8:37] <Fisheatsbear> accepted quote :D
[8:37] <tacidsky> I heard Nethack uses Doom Source Code too.
[8:37] <user> pretty sure almost every game engine has some code from quake by now
[8:37] <Majestic_XII> Westsidergw could you name what code it used from Doom? Or are you just guessing?
[8:37] <AlphaGunman> obviously they didn't change any code from quake to source
[8:37] <tacidsky> As does Dwarf Fortress
[8:37] <RyMan> Well everybody, I'm nearing 24 hours up

[8:49] <Drakkar> i'm the one saying steam could do it
[8:49] <Drakkar> without problem
[8:49] <AlphaGunman> yep
[8:49] <Westsidergw> Minecraft can't work with steam.. but it could be sold through steam.
[8:49] <AlphaGunman> westsider
[8:49] <Sr_creeper> West side
[8:49] <AlphaGunman> yes it can ffs
[8:49] <Sr_creeper> No
[8:49] <AlphaGunman> it already does
[8:49] <Sr_creeper> It has its own client

[8:50] <Westsidergw> No
[8:50] <Sr_creeper> West side, altitude is java, as drakkar said.
[8:50] <Westsidergw> And it uses the overlay
[8:50] <AlphaGunman> no shit wester it's a "HARDWARE RENDERED OVERLAY"
[8:50] <Sr_creeper> And it's on steam
[8:50] <Inverness> first, steamworks is a C/C++ API, Java bindings can be created for Minecraft
[8:50] <Drakkar> and keeps track of achievements on steam
[8:50] <Drakkar> afaik
[8:50] <Drakkar> beat hazard is C# + XNA
[8:50] <Drakkar> definitely
[8:50] <Inverness> not difficult
[8:50] <McScrappy> neeeeedupdates

[8:52] <Westsidergw> Yea. The Steamworks API is ONLY compatible with C++ applications.
[8:52] <AlphaGunman> user, i think 4 hrs
[8:52] <Kookee> ?
[8:52] <Sr_creeper> westsidergw must think that it is a steam game if it runs on source.

[8:52] <Inverness> Westsidergw, do you not understand that you can make Java bindings for Steamworks?
[8:52] <Sr_creeper> Westsider is wrong, because steamworks API works with altitude
[8:53] <Brandon1> Steamworks API is very adaptable
[8:53] <Sr_creeper> And altitude is java
[8:53] <Westsidergw> It says on the steamworks page that steamworks api is for C++ only.
[8:53] <Brandon1> Its not
[8:53] <Jevon> steamworks API is in my car and watch
[8:53] <Westsidergw> It has the Steam Overlay
[8:53] <Inverness> because its made in C++
[8:53] <Westsidergw> but not the steamworks API
[8:53] <Inverness> bindings can be made for Java
[8:53] <Sr_creeper> Westsidergw, you dont get it, you can modify API to work with java.
[8:53] <Brandon1> Steamworks API can be adapted into java
[8:53] <Westsidergw> BINDINGS?

[8:53] <Kookee> Westsidergw: They're plenty of games where the overlay DOES NOT WORK.
[8:53] <Brandon1> yeah they are
[8:53] <Miclee> Altitude was originally java, but rewritten, iirc.
[8:54] <Westsidergw> How so? Syntax?
[8:54] <Inverness> Westsidergw, what do you think Java was made with?
[8:54] <Sr_creeper> Westsidergw just doesnt want to lose an argument, even though everyone here can agree that he lost it.
[8:54] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Has the update been yet?
[8:54] <Rock_D> i think he's just one of those 'i dont get it' trolls
[8:54] <Inverness> Sr_creeper, indeed
[8:54] <Westsidergw> Being made with C++ doesn't make it C++
[8:54] <Redshift> they see me trollin....
[8:54] <Brandon1> Java and C are very close when it comes to syntax
[8:54] <rampageturke> FlyingOvenOfDoom no
[8:54] <Jevon> C++ is Java
[8:54] <Brandon1> C is a bit more annoying though
[8:54] <Westsidergw> Syntax doesn't make languages the same.

[8:54] <Westsidergw> You people are idiots.
[8:54] <AlphaGunman> ok
[8:54] <Inverness> the programmers here*
[8:54] <Westsidergw> I'm a professional c# dev.

[8:54] <Brandon1> You can interface between the two you retard
[8:54] <Westsidergw> I don't make games.. but I know what I'm talking about.
[8:55] <WolfY> Isnt that the point of an API, to bridge the gap?
[8:55] <AlphaGunman> lol westsider

[8:55] <Spoks> Sure is programmers'y in here
[8:55] <Sr_creeper> Us!
[8:55] <Inverness> first of All, what does Minecraft use to render?
[8:55] <Westsidergw> You people are convinced that Java and C++ are the same! What the hell is that saying?
[8:55] <Kookee> ok westsidergw: if you're a C# dev, then post your work.
[8:55] <Inverness> OpenGL right?
[8:55] <Inverness> what is OpenGL in? C
[8:55] <Redshift> i agree with westidergw
[8:55] <Jevon> you can make C++ isnt coffee
[8:55] <Brandon1> Minecraft uses OpenGL
[8:55] <Jevon> java is
[8:55] <WolfY> LOL
[8:55] <Jevon> oops
[8:55] <rampageturke> AlphaGunman he made a clock in VB he is good
[8:55] <WolfY> thanks for the input Jevon :P
[8:55] <Inverness> you know why Minecraft can use OpenGL? because of Java bindings for OpenGL
[8:55] <Jevon> minus "you can make"
[8:55] <Horrible> OpenGL is to linux as DirectX is to Microsoft.
[8:55] <Westsidergw> I cant. I'll tell you as much as I can though
[8:55] <Sr_creeper> Westsidergw is too smart for us, he must leave, becaus ehe is obviously better than the other 50 people proving him wrong!
[8:55] <AlphaGunman> HOLY FUCK A CLOCK IN VB?!?!??

[8:58] <Drakkar> Westsidergw, steamworks works by sending packets, you would have to program your own game-end interaction with the steamworks API and they actually encourage that and provide the relevant documentation for it

[9:29] <Inverness> Notch, could you just add handcars that you can power by getting on them and holding down the arrow keys? Much like boats
[9:29] <Brandon1> MUSIC IS BACK IN
[9:29] <Brandon1> I HEAR MUISC
[9:29] <tj505050> then can you make it so you can ride in the powered minecart

[9:38] <Inverness> Spades, you put an empty normal cart in front of the powered one
[9:38] <toaster468> ok
[9:38] <Brandon1> You put a regular rideable cart infront of powered one

[9:39] <Brandon1> Why
[9:39] <thelinx> slot9: A zombie trying to get in
[9:39] <Dommys> All this attention on the HEAD of the cow
[9:39] <Outpost> Inverness: Put it this way
[9:39] <Brandon1> it is awesome
[9:39] <slot9> lol!
[9:39] <Inverness> which is anonying and clunky
[9:39] <thelinx> but he will burn soon enough
[9:39] <Outpost> You can make TRAINS like that
[9:39] <Inverness> rather than just having a simple handcar
[9:39] <Dommys> They gianed a pink "knob" on the bottom too
[9:39] <Brandon1> the powered carts are awesome
[9:39] <Spades> Everything is broken.
[9:39] <Inverness> that you can ride, and hold down arrow key to move
[9:39] <Spades> So will IRC soon.
[9:39] <Inverness> that is all I ask for, handcar that moves as fast as boats
[9:39] <PandaBear> Anyone tried linking powered minecarts
[9:39] <Redshift> LOL, a cow got into an empty cart in front of a powered cart, and got carried off
[9:39] <PandaBear> together
[9:39] <Merciless> brandon1 can you ride them y/n
[9:39] <Spades> Inverness: I agree.
[9:39] <acid> milk can be collected from cow with a bucket now
[9:39] <Brandon1> no

[9:40] <Brandon1> but you can put a ridable one infont of a powered one

[10:48] <Spades> Powered minecarts.

[10:49] <Areals> holy shit it is a record player
[10:49] <gear1> im going to go see kesha tonight
[10:49] <Roy> I figured the recipe out the second the update happened.. x.x
[10:49] <gear1> lmfao
[10:49] <Demki> I don't hear any music in minecraft, and it says "Music: ON"
[10:49] <FNugget> My train roundabout works perfectly!
[10:49] <Roy> It plays every 10 mins or so, Demki
[10:49] <anguule> Areals: what makes it a record player
[10:49] <Demki> oh
[10:49] <Bluelight> Am I right if I think Notch added a record player?
[10:49] <Spades> Demki: It takes a while to kick in.
[10:49] <Willox> Really?
[10:49] <Areals> planks surrounding a diamond
[10:49] <bihgboi> minecraft needs levelling
[10:49] <anguule> no, i mean.
[10:49] <bihgboi> and stats
[10:49] <anguule> why is it a record player?
[10:49] <anguule> it looks like a box with a hole in it
[10:49] <Spades> No.
[10:49] <Spades> No stats.

[10:49] <Spades> No leveling.
[10:49] <Areals> because it has a spindle
[10:49] <Spades> That's runescape.
[10:49] <anguule> it looks like a hole for a ballot box
[10:49] <Spades> This. Is. MINECRAFT.
[10:50] <DocRawr> Is Notch going to add server plug ins?
[10:50] <Lantris> It's a record player
[10:50] <Roy> Stats and leveling would kill the game
[10:50] <bihgboi> you dont think it would be cool to have a miner class
[10:50] <anguule> well why is it a record player?
[10:50] <bihgboi> or a merchant class
[10:50] <khashai> anguule: old record players sometimes looked like boxes with holes in them. srsly.
[10:50] <Spades> Indeed.
[10:50] <anguule> what does it do?
[10:50] <Spades> So would money.
[10:50] <bihgboi> toolmaker class
[10:50] <bihgboi> fighter class
[10:50] <Spades> Money would wreak this game.
[10:50] <DocRawr> Classes would be good in a server plugin!
[10:50] <Roy> No, classes limit us from doing everything
[10:50] <DocRawr> Notch said he might add coins
[10:50] <Lantris> How long doe the carts work with coal?
[10:50] <Spades> SMP should have trading, yes, but NO money.

[10:50] <Mos> http://i.imgur.com/PU1yf.png this is the best minecraft hack i've seen yet imo
[10:51] <Roy> Yeah, I made a cart go for like 15 minutes to test it, Lantris, it didn't stop
[10:51] <Roy> In a loop
[10:51] <Spades> Roy: That makes sense, but at the same time, I might say I want, like, iron bars.
[10:51] <Dinare> If currency won't be added, people will just use gold bars as an alternative to coins.
[10:51] <Lantris> YES
[10:51] <DocRawr> Is anyone on the SMP right now?
[10:51] <Loachy> can anyone update me on todays update? :P
[10:51] <Spades> I know.
[10:51] <Lantris> I CAN BECOME RAILROAD TYCOON!
[10:51] <acid> notch said he liked the idea that both players throw their stuff on the ground and if you dont get what you want you hit them with your axe
[10:51] <anguule> Dinare: but gold is useless
[10:51] <Nicknam4> Chickens
[10:51] <JamesK89> How do powered minecarts work? The websites has dead ;_;

[10:52] <Lantris> You will need 2 furnace carts to push you up moutains
[10:52] <Nicknam4> To craft the record player put wood over diamond
[10:52] <anguule> so what does this supposed record player do?
[10:52] <Lily_White> ... One of the passcodes was "CreeperBorg"
[10:52] <Lily_White> @__@

[11:00] <eric_dielli> do you have to right-click to make them go?
[11:00] <DocRawr> You have to right click them
[11:00] <Nicknam4> so he must have replaced an item
[11:00] <Lily_White> thought that when Roy was talking about Powered Carts and stuff, I thought that he meant Mithril as in the material
[11:00] <Lily_White> `-`

[11:12] <Keiya> I think a creeper asploded a chicken o.O
[11:12] <TrueSlide> I can't find any effing chickens! D:
[11:12] <TsukasaFanatic> Survival to build a base
[11:12] <Nahob> How do you find these "DUNGEONS" ???
[11:12] <TsukasaFanatic> And mine for material
[11:12] <Clearbrook> There are chickens everywhere here
[11:12] <TsukasaFanatic> And explore
[11:12] <Dinare> With your eyes.
[11:12] <Brotagonist> Do I need to generate a new map or anything?
[11:13] <Mithril> TrueSlide: I cant find them too
[11:13] <Ze_Flan> Oh, so you get peaceful mode in survival to survive against the unholy hoardes of farm animals?
[11:13] <Roy> Does anyone have the ID for the CDs yet?
[11:13] <thelinx> FUCK THAT SCARED ME
[11:13] <TsukasaFanatic> Sure I could easily sit in my house and live fine with what I got
[11:13] <tman523> I want to hold a chicken above my head and use it to make me fall slowly to the ground
[11:13] <thelinx> I went down my stairs
[11:13] <TrueSlide> Finally found one.
[11:13] <thelinx> turned the corner to my entrance
[11:13] <pontuzedberg> 2222A
[11:13] <TrueSlide> It's cute! :3
[11:13] <TsukasaFanatic> But I go exploring caves and find new lands
[11:13] <thelinx> and BAM SKELETON FIRES ARROW
[11:13] <Mithril> Why is there CDs in minecraft? Notch said no advanced technology
[11:13] <thelinx> dead

[11:13] <TrueSlide> CDs? O_O
[11:13] <Greo> dungeons and creepers
[11:13] <TsukasaFanatic> When you go underground you won't be save in a little mud hut
[11:13] <Mithril> COOL A CHICKEN
[11:13] <acid> i wouldnt callrecords advanced..
[11:13] <Ze_Flan> Record players aren't advanced Mithril
[11:13] <gear1> they could be records
[11:13] <Nunu> Cool, I crashed minecraft by spaming minecarts on a track
[11:13] <TsukasaFanatic> Creepers will blow them away
[11:14] <Jacob_> Minecraft seems to be set between 1880 and 1920
[11:14] <Greo> okay
[11:14] <Greo> time to start a new world

[11:14] <FNugget> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=16842
[11:14] <tman523> Zombies and giant spiders were a real problem in 1880
[11:14] <acid> minecraft is pseudo-fantasy, its whatever notch wants it to be
[11:14] <bihgboi> so at some point does a little mud hut not protect you?
[11:14] <Nunu> they all went random and started going with insane speeds
[11:14] <gear1> what acid said
[11:14] <Dinare> tman523 I had it for a sec, but it went down again.
[11:14] <FNugget> wooo, my plans worked out
[11:14] <Allezk> any one know how to make cds/records ?
[11:14] <gear1> you find them
[11:14] <Allezk> oh :(
[11:14] <TrueSlide> Do I still need to hunt spiders for string?

[11:56] <Learner0> It looks like the forum is doing slightly better
[11:56] <EpicPhail> Notch is probably like, living in a solid gold mansion.
[11:56] <Yoshimitsu> Yeh but if its on steam there wil be an automatic +10k sales
[11:56] <Inverness> Ze_Flan, putting it on Steam means a lot more visibility
[11:56] <Resetting> if your names a reference to the tekken character you have my respect.
[11:56] <Nahob> whats the link for the isometric infmap viewer??
[11:56] <SnowmanHTC> Notch lives in an appartment
[11:56] <Ze_Flan> But less profits
[11:56] <EpicPhail> D:
[11:56] <benjgvps> SnowmanHTC: Not for long :)
[11:56] <Inverness> Ze_Flan, nope
[11:56] <Ze_Flan> Steam would take some money for it wouldn't they?
[11:56] <Furyhunter> The customer conversion rate is increasing. The percentage of paid accounts is already at 13.09%
[11:56] <Inverness> Ze_Flan, the increased visibility would outweigh any lost value in the form of cuts for Valve
[11:56] <EpicPhail> I just want to check on the Haven and Hearth topic, but noooo
[11:56] <Yoshimitsu> I think we will all get a code to redeem minecraft on steam
[11:56] <SnowmanHTC> benjgvps, he just moved there

[12:00] <Zerim> Animator, get a defibrillator
[12:00] <Tchou> yup
[12:00] <SnowmanHTC> Animator, it's not working! Get the deflibliratorthingy

[12:20] <blaster> How fast does a powered minecart travel, can I ride on it, and how much coal does it use up?
[12:20] <Moleman> Ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssso guysssssssssssssssss
[12:20] <Namzo> I need help
[12:20] <tman523> Does wool have any purpose now?
[12:20] <Inverness> There are 3 things that would make powered carts better. 1st, handcars that you can power by being in them and holding down arrow key for personal transport. 2, make the coal powered carts go faster and have more thrust for getting up hills. 3, make carts attachable to eachother
[12:20] <Brotagonist> ?
[12:20] <blaster> THE PLAYER WALKING ANIMATION IS CHANGED

[12:20] <TheDemon> i've got no idea what this chat is about, im really just trying to find some random guy that came into another IRC. Talking about how he had tapeworms and that was his handle pretty selfish.
[12:20] <blaster> It looks like actual walking now
[12:20] <Inverness> 4 should be make them act like furnace where they get X seconds of thrust per piece of coal
[12:21] <Moleman> Yep.
[12:21] <blaster> Before it looked like spastic autism
[12:21] <TheDemon> So with that said, anyone in here say anything about tapeworm recently? i used magical powers od google to guide me here
[12:21] <Inverness> so you can figure out how many pieces of coal you need to use for your thing to get somewhere else without you
[12:21] <tman523> Does wool have any purpose now?
[12:21] <Rocksheep> With wool you can make paintings
[12:21] <tman523> ah
[12:21] <Rocksheep> and thats it
[12:21] <Moleman> Keeps track of how many sheep you have slain?
[12:21] <tman523> any useful purpose?

[13:42] <Quatroking> ID mirror: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1673597/Blocks%2C_items_and_data_values.htm
[13:42] <Sr_creeper> Why not work to make 64 tnt for a rave?
[13:42] <BurningToad> hello, I was walking along my game and then I got frozen in place, the screen is really jumpy. I tried breaking blocks around me and they stutter around to. after a bit it stops jumping around but if I try to move again I get stuck again
[13:42] <tj50505o> how do you make records
[13:42] <Sr_creeper> You don tmake them
[13:42] <tj50505o> yea
[13:42] <Kizzycocoa> or has he kept you in the dark about your own jukeboxes? :\/
[13:42] <Kitoari> do you know how much gunpowder that would take
[13:42] <Snowman> Quatroking, do I have to use the hex or the decimal numbers for the blocks and stuff?

[13:42] <Quatroking> Snowman, decimal
[13:42] <Sr_creeper> Kitoari, Oh no, you have to work.
[13:42] <C418> anythings okay. it would have been magic stones otherwise
[13:42] <Snowman> K
[13:42] <FNugget> Why would powered carts be useless?
[13:42] <C418> like this, it's okay I guess
[13:42] <tj50505o> how do you make records
[13:42] <Sr_creeper> You don tTj
[13:42] <Kizzycocoa> oh, ok! how do they work? I mean, it worked once, then stopped
[13:42] <Kizzycocoa> :S
[13:42] <Kitoari> 5 for one tnt, so you'll need to kill 2 creepers.
[13:42] <tj50505o> oh
[13:43] <C418> what do you mean?
[13:43] <Sr_creeper> They're in dungeons
[13:43] <Kitoari> even at the best drop rates
[13:43] <Snowman> Quatroking, I can just make a stack of 1000?
[13:43] <ChewBaker> how are the powered carts made
[13:43] <NMLittle> Do we know how many different pieces of music/sound the records have?
[13:43] <Kizzycocoa> like, the first one I placed played, then it stopped
[13:43] <Kitoari> that's still over 100 creeper
[13:43] <Quatroking> 255
[13:43] <Kitoari> s\
[13:43] <C418> I thought you meant theoretically, not buggy or something
[13:43] <Kizzycocoa> didn't hear any music after
[13:43] <Sr_creeper> Kitoari, So what?
[13:43] <C418> oh, it doesn't loop
[13:43] <C418> obviously
[13:43] <Kin> FNugget, they can only push, not pull, and you can't sit on them
[13:43] <Kizzycocoa> I know, but playing after it stops?
[13:43] <FNugget> Kizzycocoa: place jukebox, add disc
[13:43] <C418> ...thats why it doesn't loop
[13:43] <Kin> So the most you can do as far as I can see is walk behind
[13:43] <C418> :P
[13:43] <Kizzycocoa> ...disk? O.o
[13:44] <C418> no, its not discs, it's vinyls!
[13:44] <FNugget> Kin: hit it empty handed to change direction, add coal to power
[13:44] <DimJim> Anyone else listened to 13.ogg?
[13:44] <tj50505o> or put then in a uie then click then ride a pushed one
[13:44] <Cheeseum> they can push another minecart I think
[13:44] <Kizzycocoa> ...what?
[13:44] <Sr_creeper> Kizzy, just take the record out and put it back in, like a real record player would >:C
[13:44] <Kizzycocoa> how do I disk?
[13:44] <Kin> Oh, alright, thanks
[13:44] <Willox> Garbage day!
[13:44] <DimJim> 13.ogg is one of the record songs
[13:44] <Sr_creeper> Dungeons
[13:44] <Quatroking> Animator, you said aera had ideas, could you explain that a bit?
[13:44] <ChewBaker> you can make a redstone gate to make it loop
[13:44] <tman523> i MADE A NEW WORLD AND SPAWNED IN A ACEV'
[13:44] <FNugget> 13, and cat. I dont think theres more.
[13:44] <DimJim> You can hear arrows being fired and then the sounds of skeletons being hurt
[13:44] <Kitoari> sr_creeper: it's tedious, boring, takes forever, and worst of all is based on LUCK.
[13:44] <Sr_creeper> C418, what program do you use to make the midi songs?
[13:44] <DimJim> Then it cuts off
[13:44] <C418> midi songs?
[13:44] <Kitoari> and it's a case of "having your cake and eating it too"
[13:44] <Sr_creeper> Kitoari, so dont cheat?
[13:45] <Kizzycocoa> so, anyone know how to make disks?

[13:45] <slowriot> guys, do powered minecarts go on forever?
[13:45] <Kitoari> at least with mining for a castle you keep the reward.
[13:45] <C418> there is no way to craft music
[13:45] * gdude2002 is now known as gdude2002|away
[13:45] <C418> I THOUGHT THAT WAS OBVIOUS
[13:45] <BurningToad> hello, I was walking along my game and then I got frozen in place, the screen is really jumpy. I tried breaking blocks around me and they stutter around to. after a bit it stops jumping around but if I try to move again I get stuck again. any ideas?
[13:45] <Kizzycocoa> but.....how do you hear the music again? x.x
[13:45] <Sr_creeper> C418, Cat sounds like a midi
[13:45] <Kin> Has anyone made a native linux GUI for invedit?
[13:45] <C418> whatever

[13:46] <Sr_creeper> Sure it took a day, but it was worth it to rub it in peoples faces
[13:46] <Willox> Worked for me, all i am saying
[13:46] <Quatroking> snowman, set the damage to 9999
[13:47] <SireTRM> DBN, was that your mob trap map, and if so, will you post a link to the save file?
[13:47] <Willox> Oh, also mineedit can fix it

[13:47] <Kitoari> good for you, I respect your ungodly patience. I prefer to reserve mine for more important things.

[13:47] <Sr_creeper> thelinx Yeah, but it was a while ago
[13:47] <Kodaichi> alright
[13:47] <Snowman> Quatroking, can you edit a world that you're currently using?
[13:47] <Sr_creeper> I deeted it D:

[13:50] <Quatroking> real men use NBTedit
[13:50] <DimJim> Seeing as the minecraft forums are down, can I post my theory behind 13.ogg here?
[13:51] <BurningToad> Willox, I figured it out, I hit F to change fog distance and now I can move
[13:51] <DimJim> It's kind of long and will take a few posts and might look a little spammy, which is why I'm asking
[13:51] <SireTRM> So, this will make it work with Mono more effectively, Kin? If so, yes.

[13:52] <DimJim> At 1:05 while playing it, you can hear the unmistakable sound of arrows. Two are fired, one misses. After that you can hear clatters of skeletons being hit. The weird, small crystalline sounds heard before this could be people mining, or possibly beasts attempting to get in.
[13:52] <DimJim> At 1:30, the sound stops completely. Later it cuts to near silence, the ambient noises of a cave.
[13:52] <DimJim> Where do you find these records?
[13:52] <DimJim> In ruins.
[13:52] <Kin> Yeah, I just plan on editing it so it isn't as ugly, and has save support.

[13:54] <Conundrumer> but then the realization of the amount of time I waste is more negative than satisfaction I get
[13:54] <Mopquill> @Visiiri, I would like one. :D
[13:54] <acid> SCII!
[13:54] <Kitoari> sr_creeper: when you gather enough redstone dust to apparently make a functional turing machine, call us back.
[13:54] <SireTRM> DBN, I understand the basic configuration, however I would like to have saves of more of the mob traps.
[13:54] <Prime_Intellect> lol

[13:54] <Kitoari> HelloSnow
[13:54] <Prime_Intellect> i want a NotchHorse
[13:54] <Kitoari> That actually sounds kinda cool.
[13:54] <Sr_creeper> First of all, how many do you need?
[13:54] <Sr_creeper> And what is a turing machine
[13:54] <SireTRM> BAHAHA.

[13:55] <Conundrumer> Redstone: 14665
[13:55] <SireTRM> DBN, could you just PM me the link or get things finished, then send me the link?

[13:55] <Sr_creeper> Did you guys ever think that a turing machine wasnt meant to be made if you cant find enough dust?
[13:55] <Mopquill> heya, Quatroking, is something up with the miniecraft wiki's server? Is there anything I can do to help? I have a fairly capable VPS.

[13:56] <Mopquill> I figured, but, I was asking if I could mirror any content or anything to take off some of the strain. Just trying to help.

[14:07] <Mopquill> I meant for simple file sharing between normal users
[14:07] <WedTM> the system will still search for homegroups out there.
[14:07] <Mopquill> That is a service though
[14:07] <Mopquill> you can disable that on a specific machine
[14:07] <WedTM> Shows up on the network as an ARP ACK request to the broadcast address.
[14:07] <Mopquill> and then just ghost athe PCs with the already configured one
[14:07] <WedTM> true, but disabling it on 1500 was a PITA.
[14:07] <Mopquill> loading up an OS onto all machines without configuring it first and going live is a bit wreckless

[14:16] <WedTM> I've written a custom server that can handle upto 255 players
[14:16] <Link2006> EpicPhail is EpicWin with his name
[14:16] <Mopquill> so, uh interesting bug
[14:16] <vede> If you're going to have people spectating, why not just let them play?
[14:16] <Mopquill> you can milk a bowl. XD
[14:16] <WedTM> ripped apart the minecraft+ server.
[14:16] <EpicPhail> Yes bfzzzzz

[14:16] <EpicPhail> There are
[14:16] <Jesse> You can "milk" bulls bfzzzz
[14:16] <vede> WedTM, that was a creative server.
[14:16] <Jesse> and that just ain't right.
[14:16] <Conundrumer> bfzzzz, that was last update
[14:16] <WedTM> true that.
[14:16] <bfzzzz> well, i'm buying another copy.
[14:16] <EpicPhail> You can make a river with it too
[14:16] <bfzzzz> that seals it.
[14:16] <EpicPhail> I have a waterfall.
[14:16] <mnjiman> \another copy
[14:16] <WolfX> a bowl or a bull?
[14:16] <WedTM> vede, that's correct.
[14:16] <Mopquill> nvm, you're right
[14:16] <vede> Servers that are constantly streaming map data will require insanely more bandwidth than creative servers.

[14:16] <WedTM> the byte stream for the map is small
[14:17] <vede> Creative servers send the level once, then send a few changes every now and then.
[14:17] <Kizzycocoa> how do you make jukeboxes play music?
[14:17] <Mopquill> tow bfzzzz's one bucket
[14:17] <Conundrumer> how about an infinite map
[14:17] <WedTM> you only need to update the viewable space

[14:17] <Mopquill> two*
[14:17] <bfzzzz> damn right
[14:17] <vede> The SMP server has to send massive chunks of the level every time a player walks.
[14:17] <Link2006> Ohhh I know what the server needs
[14:17] <Mopquill> no
[14:17] <Conundrumer> there's a reason why smp is taking a while to be made

[14:17] <WedTM> Correct
[14:17] <Link2006> ...Or not
[14:17] <DimJim> So Minecraft is apparently getting a little bit of a plot
[14:17] <vede> Mopquill, which is every sixteen blocks.
[14:17] <WedTM> That's not that bad.
[14:17] <Mopquill> All the way down
[14:17] <bfzzzz> a plot of land?
[14:18] <vede> WedTM, yes, it is bad.
[14:18] <EpicPhail> Har har har
[14:18] <Mopquill> No, it's not.
[14:18] <Mopquill> Each block is represented by a digit
[14:18] <WedTM> okay, well when you get off dialup and join the rest of the world, let me know.
[14:18] <Conundrumer> mopquill, incorrect
[14:18] <Mopquill> it just has to send something rather small, considering data
[14:18] * Arghn (Mibbit@cpe-24-160-190-203.columbus.res.rr.com) has left #minecraft
[14:18] <Conundrumer> first, it's a byte, if I'm not wrong
[14:18] <WedTM> actually, it's EXTREMELY small
[14:18] <WedTM> http://github.com/wedtm/Buzur/blob/master/BUZUR/Block.cs
[14:18] <Conundrumer> thne, multiply it by a lot
[14:19] <Mopquill> still small on a net's scale.
[14:19] <vede> It has to send 16 16x16x128 chunks every time a player moves sixteen blocks in a single direction.
[14:19] <bfzzzz> man, this mincraft update is giving me (byte)5
[14:19] <Lisimba> Still, it has to do that whether you are spectator or player. So spectator mode isn't very useful over player mode.
[14:19] <Conundrumer> then why is notch taking so long to make smp
[14:19] <WedTM> You have to send the block type, the x, y, z coords

[14:19] <Mopquill> and memory/processor issues, conundrummer
[14:19] <WedTM> and the byte type is a byte
[14:19] <Mopquill> bandwidth isn't the problem
[14:19] <Mopquill> it's system resources.
[14:19] <bfzzzz> it's not the size that matters, it's the block type
[14:20] <WedTM> err block type
[14:20] <EpicPhail> "It's not the size that matters" That's what she said :D

[14:20] <Mopquill> basically, the server has to make sure everyone is doing the right stuff
[14:20] <Philol> Jukebox...? is that....
[14:20] <vede> Bandwidth matters, especially on infinite servers, and *especially* when you want to have fucktons of players.
[14:20] <Philol> real?
[14:20] <Conundrumer> bandwidth isn't the problem, but having a spectator will still cause strain
[14:20] <Mopquill> and yes, sending all that map data at once, not really a problem
[14:20] <Mopquill> having it all loaded into allocated memory at once
[14:21] <Mopquill> that is a problem
[14:21] <Conundrumer> well, that's if yuo're right
[14:21] <Mopquill> I don't know about you, but, I'd disable spectators on my server
[14:21] <Conundrumer> i don't know

[14:21] <Philol> lol whats it do??
[14:21] <Mopquill> Notch has said you could have 20-24 players on 1GB of RAM
[14:21] <EpicPhail> You don't know what a jukebox is?
[14:21] * PandaBusy has to go: Bai
[14:21] <Mopquill> there's a reason he's concerned about RAM and not bandwidth

[14:21] <Philol> well it just seems like total bs
[14:22] <Conundrumer> is this an argument?
[14:22] <vede> But so many idiots seem to think that spectators won't cause any actual strain on a server.
[14:22] <Mopquill> They absolutely would
[14:22] <EpicPhail> Of course it would o_o I don't know anything about what you're talking about
[14:22] <Mopquill> especially because they could likely travel faster
[14:22] <Philol> password fuxes that
[14:22] <EpicPhail> But I know that for sure.
[14:22] <Mopquill> and you'd have to keep whatever they are looking at in memory
[14:22] <vede> 30 players and 500 spectators would cause just as much strain as 530 players.
[14:22] <Mopquill> I'm sure there be an option to disable spectators

[14:26] <Quatroking> along with my other internal drives which all have letters

[14:27] <Quatroking> (the network shares)
[14:27] <Philol> if I place a juke box, can i pick it back up?
[14:27] <Mopquill> C needs different permissions
[14:27] <Mopquill> because Windows is on it.
[14:27] <Conundrumer> let me check philol
[14:27] <Quatroking> Well yeah but my other drives don't work either
[14:27] <vede> 7 bytes per block for sending entire chunks would just be ridiculous.
[14:27] <WedTM> so 35,000 blocks * 7 = ~273k
[14:27] <Mopquill> it's really recommended to just move everything you want to share, or to share each folder, as C isn't supposed to have many to begin with
[14:27] <Quatroking> I'm trying to open them up using Win2K, by the way
[14:27] <WedTM> So like I said, unless your on dialup, not that bad.
[14:27] <Mopquill> ah, then the permissions are wrong
[14:27] <vede> WedTM, times sixteen.
[14:27] <RyMan> 40,000 purchases!
[14:27] <Mopquill> Ah
[14:27] <vede> Times the number of current clients.
[14:27] <Mopquill> then you have to add the group everyone in advanced
[14:28] <WedTM> Why times the current clients?
[14:28] <Mopquill> let me pull up the window so I can tell you how to do it.
[14:28] <Conundrumer> yea it does
[14:28] <Conundrumer> @philol
[14:28] <Quatroking> Well
[14:28] <WedTM> The only people that need to know that are the people in the viewable range
[14:28] <Mopquill> mind if I take this to PM?
[14:28] <EmpiresBane> WedTM, that would be bad on DSL
[14:28] <vede> WedTM, because you have to send chunks to every player.
[14:28] <Quatroking> Go ahead
[14:28] <Philol> You can pick it back?

[14:28] <WedTM> Correct, the server stores those, and when a new player comes in, and hasn't seen these blocks yet, you update them.
[14:29] <EmpiresBane> it doesn't even matter if the area is different
[14:29] <WedTM> the area wouldn't be different.

[14:36] <lifeless> got blown up, and thrown down a huge hole
[14:36] <Clearbrook> There is still no use for milk?

[14:37] <violetblood> hmm
[14:37] <tb2571989> lifeless, that happened to me yesterday
[14:37] <violetblood> you?re lying
[14:37] <Rehevkor> violetblood: I got into the SMP server earlier. It was mega laggy and there were no trees, so no one could make tools.
[14:38] <DBN> it's not a bug it's a feature
[14:38] <Rehevkor> and then it crashed on me

[14:38] <Clearbrook> I like the idea that the current test server should be a "you die, you get kicked" server
[14:38] <vede> Right now it's essentially a really broken Creative mode with infinite maps and slow block destruction.
[14:38] <DBN> am i the only one who's never even tried connecting?
[14:38] <Jesse> It won't be anything like that on release...right?
[14:38] <Jesse> :(
[14:38] <lifeless> oh wow
[14:38] <lifeless> i went to the point where the creeper blew it up
[14:38] <vede> No mobs, no entities, no smelting, etc.
[14:39] <lifeless> and it blew up several full chests
[14:39] <lifeless> holy fuck
[14:39] <Mopquill> I still haven't been able to get onto that server. XD
[14:39] <SmokestormX> No jesse, i imagine its so slow becuase its got to deal with people trying to connect so much
[14:39] <Rehevkor> Jesse: he's making improvements to it every day pretty much, so I'm sure he'll have it polished up eventually

[14:41] <tb2571989> i've managed to get three powered carts to push me up a hill...worked, eventually

[14:43] <Zerim> Great job, C418
[14:43] <Jesse> lol
[14:43] <WedTM> Someone should tell Notch that he's missing a block from the M in the title screen
[14:43] <Quatroking> Zerim, Notch, derp
[14:43] <Zerim> Bad thing, violetblood
[14:43] <Jesse> 4chan isn't bad.

[14:43] <Hunter712> <vede> Hunter712, wouldn't it have been a lot easier to, like, edit the page source?
[14:43] <Zerim> 90% of 4chan is bad
[14:43] <Hunter712> I did it in Steam
[14:43] <Zerim> >.>
[14:43] <Jesse> Damn quatro beat me to it.
[14:43] <Hunter712> Not on the website :V
[14:43] <Mopquill> I agree with Zerim.
[14:43] <Zerim> /b/ leaks all over it
[14:43] <Quatroking> Zerim, i doubt you have even browsed 10% of it
[14:43] <Mopquill> I'd like to be open-minded about it
[14:43] <violetblood> 4chan looks like a gay site
[14:44] <Jesse> 90%? pfft lol

[14:44] <Zerim> I know some boards aren't bad off topic, but /b/ still leaks all over it

[14:44] <Quatroking> I'm sure the minecraft community is gay-ass shit now
[14:44] <Philol> it is
[14:44] <violetblood> hope not
[14:44] <Zerim> No, because we have mods

[14:44] <Philol> not that i condone words like gay-ass-shit
[14:44] <Zerim> I mean
[14:44] <Mopquill> I know that, Conundrummer, but what they do behind the anonymity of the internet they think they have
[14:45] <Conundrumer> quatroking, I've always seen the mc community as "gay-ass shit"
[14:45] <Zerim> mods and a small enough community that it's possible to moderate it
[14:45] <Mopquill> it's almost like they don't realize the other people they are affecting are real people
[14:45] <Conundrumer> they're totally aware of it
[14:45] <Mopquill> or maybe it's easy because they can't see these people

[14:45] <SkindianaBones> It's a masterpiece
[14:45] <Jesse> and then say it has no mods.

[15:32] <slowriot> can't say i've seen slimes combining
[15:32] <rbos> minecarts are tough to get into, because if you use coal on a pushcart, it goes in the wrong direction, so you have to use it, then jump into the cart
[15:32] <Ohelig> how does reed grow? if I have a tower of 3, can I split it into 3 towers of 1, and eventually have 9 in total?
[15:32] <Clearbrook> yes
[15:32] <rbos> Ohelig: ayep
[15:32] <Clearbrook> they grow from being 1 high
[15:32] <Armonte> how do I make a trebuchets
[15:33] <rbos> I usually plant a bunch, then trim them off at 1

[15:35] <Drakkar> which explode
[15:35] <Drakkar> and then more baby creepers

[15:36] <Drakkar> no

[16:15] <JamesK89> Pro tip: Always exit the game VIA THE MENU
[16:15] <bleak> LunaticGhost yes, and then i buried myself in dirt, restarted, almost suffocated in the dirt, dug my way out and now I can move again
[16:15] <Merkurlicht> JamesK89: derp
[16:15] <JamesK89> If you exit the game by closing it with the "X" then your save will become corrupted and the game will replace it with a new world
[16:15] <Philol> yea old news james
[16:15] <JamesK89> 0xFFFFFFFF
[16:15] <Glendening> odd.. i've done that and it worked fine O.o;
[16:16] <JamesK89> Its easy to forget about though
[16:16] <Zerim> They prolly closed while saving
[16:16] <Philol> can powered mc direction be reversed?
[16:16] <Philol> with a switch or otheR?
[16:16] <Kitoari> figures that after an excellent mining run my save craps out for no apparent reason and I lose the data.
[16:16] <JamesK89> I'll probably setup myself a subversion so I can revert my MC saves

[18:10] <Zerim> lol vent
[18:10] <TsukasaFanatic> But I don't know what the 3rd one is
[18:10] <pekuja> Fisheatsbear: for something that's easy to learn, I wouldn't suggest C++. It is the industry standard for games, but it's not the easiest thing to use.

[18:50] <Fisheatsbear> gah, i forgot that mouse game
[18:50] <bleak> If there's water within a 5 square radius
[18:50] <bleak> It will get darker eventually

[19:09] <Rivenmist> I screamed a lil inside
[19:09] <slowriot> i just dug a hole above it
[19:09] <slowriot> and dropped sand over it
[19:10] <cynicalAlchemist> It says "connecting to server, logging in" and then it's staying at "logging in" so I think the server's down
[19:10] <slowriot> now i'm going to build a complicated trapping system and then release the zoms

[19:13] <Conundrumer> has anyone tried to get monsters inside carts?
[19:13] <leaper> I did pay for it
[19:14] <slowriot> so just download the executable version
[19:14] <Lisimba> leaper: just redownload the whole thing then.
[19:14] <slowriot> it'll update
[19:14] <leaper> i did
[19:14] <SireTRM> If you log into the client with a valid username/password, you will be just fine.
[19:14] <leaper> it doesnt update

[19:24] <SecretAgentCow> No, it is not. If you were born in the year late 1990's and early 2000's which I have a strange feeling a good chuck of players here are they literally have no experience with records
[19:24] <CyborgDragon> i was born in 1993
[19:24] <vede> I mean, at least say "ignorant" because then you don't make yourself sound like some sort of literature-analyzing "ohoho well I happen to be EDUCATED!" douchebag types like you do when you say "uncultured"
[19:24] <CyborgDragon> even if they have no experience with records, they've at the very least seen them in movies
[19:24] <wolf_alex> I was born in 1998 and I know about them
[19:24] <vede> Connotation goes a long way, bro.
[19:24] <wolf_alex> cause I pay attension
