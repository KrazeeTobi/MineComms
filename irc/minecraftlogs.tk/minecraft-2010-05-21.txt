[0:05] <Kodaichi> i wanna get my cat high some time
[0:05] <Kodaichi> but it's supposed to make them chill out, like weed
[0:05] <blaster> Catnip, the cats version of LSD
[0:05] <blaster> It causes halusinations apparently
[0:05] <Kodaichi> oh. that's why
[0:05] <blaster> Halusinations of fake rat toys
[0:05] <blaster> Lol
[0:05] <MuthSera> Theres no scientific way to prove it does such a thing. o.O
[0:06] <Kodaichi> he's probably seeing crazy shit and he's not used to visitors in the house or anything
[0:06] <blaster> She bit the toy open and it contains catnip
[0:06] <MuthSera> Whoever said that to you, was a damned liar.
[0:06] <blaster> And now she is going crazy
[0:06] <Kodaichi> and they're going to hell for telling such a ridiculous lie!

[0:07] <bildramer> hahaha
[0:08] <Kodaichi> only part of me HAS grown up
[0:08] <blaster> You can sort of imagine a gangster cat being a dealer of catnip
[0:08] <MuthSera> Yeah.
[0:08] <MuthSera> I just take a hoodie and add a cat's head.
[0:08] <vurtual> then some really fat one with a mustache
[0:09] <vurtual> you have to talk to him about your outstanding catnip bill.
[0:09] <blaster> And there are catnip farming cats in afganistan

[0:12] <gear> i love having like
[0:12] <gear> 10 forges
[0:12] <blaster> I have 2
[0:12] <blaster> Because I usualy take the time to craft
[0:12] <gear> and smelting a shit ton of things at once
[0:13] <blaster> people who smelt cobblestone are stupid
[0:13] <gear> i was really hoping multiplayer wouldnt have taken so long
[0:13] <blaster> What is the point?
[0:13] * SSC (ssc@i5387CD67.versanet.de) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[0:13] <blaster> I bet notch has lied about not working until june
[0:13] <gear> if for some reason your building requires that particular shade of gray
[0:13] <bildramer> blaster, better looking stone
[0:13] <bildramer> lel
[0:13] <blaster> and has been secretly working on multiplayer
[0:13] <gear> man

[0:14] <blaster> Me blaster
[0:14] <Kodaichi> apparently he's going to be adding more features before multi minecraft comes out
[0:15] <Kodaichi> as a way to get back into it
[0:15] <vurtual> I'm wondering if I should livestream this, hmm
[0:15] <Kodaichi> mob ideas, etc
[0:15] <gear> right
[0:15] <gear> but we're entertaining the idea
[0:15] <gear> that he's lied to us

[0:16] <blaster> I just want trains, a minimap and siege weapons
[0:16] <blaster> In that order
[0:16] <Kodaichi> lol
[0:16] <Kodaichi> okay okaym it's certainly possible
[0:16] <blaster> And then more tiers of gear and deeper mines with rarer resources
[0:16] <blaster> And then raep mode
[0:16] * copyboy (copyboy@p5B31EA34.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft

[0:17] <blaster> Baaa
[0:17] <blaster> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[0:17] <blaster> BOOM you lose
[0:17] <Firetempest> i want more tiers of rock that makes tiers of gear actually useful rather then a few saved seconds of time.
[0:17] <blaster> Yes that aswell
[0:18] <blaster> I want 10 tiers of gears
[0:18] <blaster> that should be enough
[0:18] <Firetempest> ugh, maybe too much
[0:18] <blaster> We already have four (Gold and wood are same tier)
[0:18] * Hunter712 (Hunter@66-227-142-89.dhcp.bycy.mi.charter.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:18] <blaster> Well if you can have the best gear possible in 10 minuets right now
[0:18] <blaster> It is needed
[0:18] <Firetempest> tiers can branch. as i would see gold being useful against undead
[0:18] <vurtual> no
[0:18] <vurtual> gold=useless
[0:18] <vurtual> this is the law
[0:19] <Quatroking> different gears should have different rotate speeds
[0:19] <bildramer> lol suicide mouse
[0:19] <bildramer> :l
[0:19] <Quatroking> also, yes, gold gears?
[0:19] <blaster> Or instead of that how about having to make crafting tables 'research things'
[0:19] <Quatroking> lawl
[0:19] <gear> gear gear gear
[0:19] <bildramer> who the hell finds that shit scary I ask myself
[0:19] <blaster> Like new recipies
[0:19] <blaster> And you can fund research using gold
[0:19] <gear> i like the idea of multiple rock teirs
[0:19] <gear> softer rocks up top
[0:19] <blaster> Which makes the game longer and gives a use for guld
[0:19] <bildramer> OH MY GOD I HAVE A SUDDEN CANCER NNNNNNGGGGGHH
[0:19] <gear> and harder rocks down below
[0:20] <blaster> harder rocks
[0:20] <blaster> harded
[0:20] <FNugget> research doesnt fit minecraft. it's almost like experience levels
[0:20] <blaster> People will make more fhenuses out of harded rocks
[0:20] <blaster> Harder
[0:20] <gear> i think an alchemy table might work as a research table
[0:20] <blaster> Research should take time
[0:20] <blaster> And resources
[0:21] <Firetempest> yeah i don't see research or blueprints catering to the ease of play minecraft is going for.
[0:21] <blaster> It would also give a way for players to discover new crafting recipies without guides
[0:21] * zeroZshadow (zeroZshado@ip4da58d18.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft
[0:21] <blaster> If it shows the new one that was researched
[0:22] <Firetempest> A ingame book that is part of the UI that shows what makes what would be nice rather then needing a bookmark to the wiki
[0:22] <vurtual> HOW LONG IS THE PAUSE MENU MUSIC IN THIS GAME
[0:22] <vurtual> It hasn't been the quite same for
[0:22] <blaster> What game?
[0:22] <vurtual> from 15 to 22
[0:22] <vurtual> Evil genius
[0:22] <blaster> Battletoads pause music
[0:22] <vurtual> I was thinking of livestreaming(tourists can already find the islands anyways)
[0:22] <vurtual> and I noticed that the menu music is ridiculously long
[0:23] <blaster> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jhl9pJB-2Ak

[0:23] <Firetempest> i'm waiting for a battletoads remake. its only a matter of time. who owns that IP anyway
[0:24] <blaster> Companies mearge and split so much
[0:24] <blaster> there is no way for anyone to tell
[0:24] <blaster> Rare
[0:24] <blaster> Rare owns it
[0:24] <gear> http://cdn.medialib.computerandvideogames.com/screens/screenshot_230727_thumb300.jpg
[0:25] <vurtual> I can now livestream this low-resolution game apparently
[0:25] <gear> i wonder how valid that is
[0:25] <gear> because battletoads is listed lmao
[0:25] <blaster> Is that gona be a port to arcade?
[0:25] <Firetempest> likely 360 arcade
[0:25] <blaster> If they have Xfree, where is natal?
[0:26] <blaster> Also why is it sony who is showing off mass effect 3
[0:26] <gear> what is xfree?

[0:29] * blaster dies
[0:29] <Dommys> Pfft.
[0:29] <Dommys> FetusFilms are awesome.
[0:29] <vurtual> livestream cannot pull 30FPS with Evil Genius open
[0:29] * Dman757 (Dman757@ip70-191-95-174.sb.sd.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:30] <vurtual> though streaming actuall works
[0:30] <Firetempest> bioware is a sub of EA so they could do ps3 i guess.
[0:31] <blaster> s
[0:31] <blaster> Stupid sony going around bribing companies to release games on their gold ingot of a console
[0:31] * vurtual bribes you into giving him money
[0:32] <blaster> Evil genius looks like a awesome game
[0:32] <vurtual> I'm livestreaming it! I have proof!
[0:32] <gear> i see nothing wrong with the ps3
[0:32] <vurtual> Of how slow it is!
[0:32] <Yourself> <blaster> Evil genius looks like a awesome game
[0:32] <vurtual> seriously
[0:32] <Yourself> it's fun
[0:32] <vurtual> it's... slow
[0:32] <blaster> Freeware or what?
[0:32] <vurtual> sure, if you suddenly have a glimpse of what to do
[0:32] <vurtual> you may just spend ages
[0:32] <vurtual> no, it's on steam, and costs money
[0:33] <Yourself> no
[0:33] <vurtual> it has a demo
[0:33] <vurtual> that thanks you for trying it.
[0:33] <Firetempest> i never went beyond the demo of evil genius. so much micromanagement with brick dumb Ai out of the Sims. maybe that was the demo though
[0:33] <vurtual> Firetempest, the demo's set to forcably have soldiers 24/7
[0:33] <Yourself> what micromanagement?
[0:33] <vurtual> in reality you can just mildly distract everyone
[0:33] <vurtual> and let the minions take care of it
[0:33] * sppt (i@ip545125db.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft
[0:33] <Firetempest> trying to get people to stop agents
[0:34] <vurtual> kill tag
[0:34] <vurtual> capture tag
[0:34] <Yourself> the only thing you can give orders to are your evil genius or the few henchmen you have
[0:34] <vurtual> annoy-them-endlessly tag
[0:34] <Yourself> your minions act on their own
[0:34] * cheezychicken (cheezychic@saqqara.demon.co.uk) has left #minecraft
[0:34] <Yourself> oh, that's easy if you design your base entrance properly
[0:34] <vurtual> the rockets on the menu
[0:34] <vurtual> they look like headcrab shells
[0:34] <Yourself> and know that the AI agents will prioritize opening doors with high security
[0:34] <vurtual> because of their back, and smoke.
[0:35] <vurtual> NO WONDER MY SIDE ENTRANCE WAS SO ATTACKED
[0:35] <vurtual> brb trapping
[0:35] <Yourself> so you make a dummy tunnel with security level 4 doors that go nowhere
[0:35] <Yourself> so you'll always have guards at the front
[0:35] <Firetempest> yeah so you manipulate your base to get minions and agents to do what you want. a fake base worked well with a ring of locked doors.
[0:35] <Yourself> and if agents try to open the door they'll automatically get marked for capture
[0:36] <Yourself> yes, it's about base design
[0:36] <vurtual> procaster exited me from my game
[0:36] <vurtual> to disconnect me from livestream
[0:36] <vurtual> for no apparent reason
[0:37] * dark (dark@c-66-177-248-172.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:37] <bildramer> ...zerg rushes look like ants
[0:37] <Firetempest> i just found its play too much like a Sims game. didn't interest me for long
[0:38] <Yourself> how far does the demo go?
[0:38] <Yourself> agents get a lot easier once you get freaks
[0:38] <Firetempest> i don't recall, i played it when it first came out
[0:38] <Dommys> Evil Genius? the flash game?
[0:38] <blaster> Does anyone know why koreans like starcraft so much
[0:38] <Yourself> since they'll automatically roam the island and kill any agents they see
[0:38] <vurtual> evil genius is not a flash game
[0:38] <Yourself> Dommys, it's not a flash game
[0:39] <blaster> I bet when starcraft 2 is released south koreas GDP will drop by half
[0:39] <vurtual> and it's not like sims
[0:39] <Dommys> There's a flash game called Evil Genius..
[0:39] <Yourself> well not that one
[0:39] <Dommys> It's kinda an rts, with weird cinematics
[0:39] <vurtual> hmm
[0:39] <bildramer> lol
[0:39] <Quatroking> BFG is quitting the GPU industry :(
[0:39] <Dommys> YAY

[0:47] <blaster> The terrain in the infdev area I am in is crazy
[0:47] <blaster> There is 3 giant valleys all next to eachover
[0:48] <blaster> Its part of the northen continent I call the continent of vallys

[0:50] <bildramer> "The advance, published in Science, has been hailed as a scientific landmark, but critics say there are dangers posed by synthetic organisms."
[0:50] <bildramer> logical thinking fail
[0:50] <Firetempest> chubby chicks have certain advantages
[0:50] <bildramer> lol @ dangers
[0:50] <vurtual> so in this one song in Medal of Honor: Frontline has a small musical cue

[0:51] <vurtual> ...what
[0:51] <blaster> he researchers hope eventually to design bacterial cells that will produce medicines and fuels and even absorb greenhouse gases.
[0:51] <blaster> absorb greenhouse gases.
[0:51] <Yourself> critics = i saw it in a movie, it must be true
[0:51] <blaster> Worst Idea ever
[0:51] <blaster> they will overpopulate the earth
[0:51] <blaster> And with no CO2 in the atmosphere all the plants would die
[0:51] <vurtual> use a bugcatching net
[0:51] <Yourself> that's only if they put you in charge of designing them
[0:52] <Firetempest> We can finally have a real Species movie.

[1:09] <Quatroking> even tho its already possible to make synthetic viruses since 2003
[1:09] <blaster> Yeh, its inhumane to save people from diseases using genetic engineering
[1:09] <blaster> Religions are the reason we dont have 2100 levels of technology now

[1:12] <blaster> Anyway how about industrial possibilitys for mars
[1:12] <Quatroking> Firetempest, go watch Ghost in the Shell
[1:12] <blaster> It has abundant resources
[1:12] <Snowman> Cause 1650763.73 wavelengths of Krypton-86 raciation is 1 meter
[1:12] <blaster> and the lack of plate techtonics means you can dig deeper without melting yourself with magma
[1:12] <Firetempest> ah yes ghost in a shell. love the major
[1:12] <Quatroking> Using synthethics, the alcohol in the beer breaks down as we drink it, making it possible to consume such things during work
[1:12] <blaster> And it has much more helium 3 than earth
[1:12] <Quatroking> same goes for smoking
[1:13] <blaster> About 4-5 times as much
[1:13] <blaster> And taking off from mars using a rocket is many times easier than for earth
[1:14] <Snowman> Smoking has a different problem
[1:14] <Snowman> Other people breathe the smoke
[1:14] <vurtual> mm, the rain outside reminds me of WW2
[1:14] <vurtual> good day for running
[1:14] <Quatroking> snowman: fuck those people
[1:14] <Yourself> too bad getting from Mars to Earth is horrendously expensive
[1:14] <Quatroking> get them synthethic lungs too
[1:14] <vurtual> Earth to Mars=expensive
[1:14] <vurtual> Mars to Earth=less
[1:15] <Snowman> What about just get rid of smoking?
[1:15] <vurtual> technically a single explosion could fling you to Earth, from Mars.
[1:15] <Quatroking> or that
[1:15] <blaster> It may even be proffitable to drag astroids into mars orbit and strip mine them
[1:15] <blaster> By taking off from mars
[1:15] <vurtual> drag them ONTO mars
[1:15] <vurtual> using rockets
[1:15] <blaster> Vurtual that sounds retarded
[1:15] <Quatroking> However I can understand some people can appriciate the taste of tabacco
[1:15] <vurtual> precision, mounted rockets
[1:15] <blaster> You could destabilise the orbit
[1:15] <vurtual> that land it
[1:15] <Yourself> by the time we're able to change the orbits of asteroids that much taking off from the surface of any planet will be trivial
[1:15] <vurtual> without blowing up the planet
[1:15] <blaster> That might work
[1:16] <blaster> But getting a 100,000 ton astroid to land is difficult
[1:16] <vurtual> Yourself, it just takes a few small rockets to push it into orbit
[1:16] <vurtual> not a massive amount of fuel.
[1:16] <Yourself> changing an asteroid's orbit would be stupid anyway
[1:16] <vurtual> hehe, eject the used asteroid by filling it with fuel.
[1:16] <blaster> also if you did not know astroids contain this special type of diamond which is 57% harder than regular diamonds

[2:28] <vurtual> no it does not

[2:31] <vurtual> okay, then the fact is 0.999999999... recurring is not 1.
[2:31] <vurtual> called it
[2:31] <Azathoth> vurtual being wrong is not the same as him trolling
[2:32] <vurtual> Unless I'm actively attempting to enrage you, generally for nothing but laughing at how angry you are, I am not trolling.

[2:32] <vurtual> That, is arguing.
[2:32] <vurtual> this is trolling, see.
[2:32] <Yourself> the fact is that 0.999... represents a real value
[2:32] <vurtual> arguing, trolling
[2:32] <vurtual> different
[2:32] <Darkflux> But there should be no argument
[2:32] <Yourself> to determine its value we can use a number of techniques

[2:37] <vede> Isn't there also a proof that's something like: (1/3)=0.333... and (1/3)*3=1, so (0.333...*3)=((1/3)*3)=1

[2:38] <Quatroking> darkflux I didn't like yakitate that much

[2:40] <sppt> Quatroking, http://www.onemanga.com/Ichigo_100/1/01/ check it out, it's genius
[2:40] <Yourself> it is true
[2:40] <Snowman> Everything equals 4
[2:41] <Snowman> Number of letters that is
[2:41] * Darkflux gains a level in 'the Internet'!
[2:41] <Quatroking> sixteen is 7 letters, seven is 5 letters, five is four
[2:41] <Quatroking> derp
[2:41] <Azathoth> there's a difference between trolling and stating an opinion
[2:41] <Quatroking> I knew that one
[2:41] <Quatroking> ugh
[2:41] <Quatroking> not ichigo
[2:41] <Cial> the anwser to everything is 42
[2:41] <sppt> haha
[2:41] <Darkflux> But how you state your opinion counts
[2:41] <Snowman> It even works in Dutch :D
[2:41] <sppt> dude, it's a great manga

[2:42] <Darkflux> It might be a great manga, but we should make clear it's not a great first manga for blaster
[2:42] <vurtual> int math() {return 42;}
[2:42] <Quatroking> Yeah, I have.
[2:43] <sppt> the whole manga?
[2:43] <Quatroking> blaster, are you finished with your nerd shit
[2:43] <Cial> make blaster read hellsing
[2:43] <Quatroking> sppt; first volume or something
[2:43] <Quatroking> not my taste

[2:43] <Quatroking> blaster go watch bible black
[2:43] <Azathoth> because then he'll be even more worthless than he already is
[2:43] <Quatroking> and fuck off
[2:43] <sppt> man
[2:43] <vede> blaster already is a weeaboo.
[2:43] <sppt> physics exam tomorrow
[2:43] <blaster> What is this
[2:43] <vede> He just doesn't know it yet.
[2:43] <sppt> i am gonna die
[2:43] <sppt> :D
[2:43] <Quatroking> bible black is an anime about religion
[2:43] <Quatroking> its really deep

[2:44] <blaster> 1. I have never realy cared about japanise culture
[2:44] <blaster> 2. I cannot even spell japanise right

[2:44] <Quatroking> Japanese
[2:44] <Quatroking> Nippon
[2:44] <sppt> Azathoth, no im not
[2:44] <sppt> :(
[2:44] <blaster> 3. I am just bored right now and trying to find something to waste my time with
[2:44] <sppt> i did a practise exam
[2:44] <Quatroking> Go watch FLCL
[2:44] <Quatroking> its 6 episodes of 30 minutes each
[2:44] <sppt> and well it was difficult :\
[2:44] <Azathoth> or trigun or ghost in the shell
[2:45] <Quatroking> made by pretty much the best studio's out there
[2:45] <Cial> Cowboy Bebop is good too
[2:45] <Yourself> what area of physics?
[2:45] <sppt> Quatroking, do you know the studio ghibli films?
[2:45] <Yourself> cowboy bebop is good
[2:45] <sppt> Yourself, pretty much everyone
[2:45] <Darkflux> English dub or subbed?
[2:45] <Quatroking> sppt quit being such a fucking retard
[2:45] <Quatroking> Look at the pics of my bedroom
[2:45] <Yourself> so quantum?
[2:45] <Quatroking> and count the totoro's
[2:46] <sppt> no Yourself
[2:46] <Yourself> general relativity instead of newtonian gravity?
[2:46] <Azathoth> sppt is probably just in mechanics
[2:46] <Darkflux> Studio ghibli is retarded?
[2:46] <sppt> Quatroking, like i have the pic open all the time
[2:46] <Darkflux> ah
[2:46] <Quatroking> I even own Totoro on DVD
[2:46] <Quatroking> LEGAL
[2:46] <Quatroking> NO SHIT
[2:46] <Yourself> Azathoth, that's what i hope
[2:46] <Darkflux> D:
[2:46] <sppt> electricity, electromagnetism, force and moment, work and energy, waves and vibrations, light and radioactivity
[2:46] <Quatroking> I actually BOUGHT a DVD
[2:46] <Azathoth> oh
[2:46] <Cial> shits legit
[2:46] <Quatroking> I'm fucking retro
[2:46] <sppt> also some other things but i dont know how to translate it
[2:46] <Yourself> oh, that's not all of them
[2:47] <Azathoth> that's like two semesters of physics
[2:47] <Quatroking> anyways, yeah, I've watched most of ghibli

[2:47] <Azathoth> high school or college, sppt?
[2:47] <sppt> err, i guess mix between both
[2:47] <Yourself> it'd be two semesters even at college level
[2:47] <Yourself> i presume it's for an AP exam
[2:47] <sppt> dutch educational system win
[2:47] <Azathoth> that's what i mean, yourself
[2:47] <Yourself> or not
[2:47] <sppt> i think it's comparable to A levels in the uk
[2:48] <Quatroking> I'm 19 when I'm finishing my study
[2:48] <Quatroking> hardcoreeee
[2:48] <Azathoth> not familiar with uk or dutch educational systems :P
[2:48] <sppt> lol
[2:48] <Quatroking> I'm probably going to do two years of programming after that tho
[2:48] <sppt> Azathoth, i can go to university after this year
[2:48] <Quatroking> learn a specific language
[2:48] <sppt> so it's that level :P
[2:48] <Yourself> well, in the US the AP physics exam is similar
[2:48] <Quatroking> stuff liek that
[2:48] <EmpiresBane> microsoft is so incompetent
[2:48] <Yourself> although it's in two parts
[2:48] <Yourself> mechanics and then E&M
[2:48] <Yourself> and you don't have to do both
[2:48] <sppt> yeah well we get everything in one go
[2:48] <EmpiresBane> i formated my flash drive for extra memory on my xbox
[2:48] <Yourself> you don't actually have to do any
[2:48] <Azathoth> my high school didn't do AP physics :(
[2:49] <Quatroking> sppt, I did VMBO so I don't get to go to university but I'm in my first year of ICT Management
[2:49] <sppt> and i heard exams in america are piss easy
[2:49] <Yourself> but you get college credit if you do well, so it's worthwhile
[2:49] <Quatroking> going to the second next year
[2:49] <EmpiresBane> 1gb drive. I could only use 400Mb
[2:49] <Quatroking> started this study at age 15
[2:49] <Quatroking> bawww
[2:49] <sppt> Quatroking, you might be able to if you go from mbo->hbo, get your p -> uni
[2:49] <Azathoth> standardized tests in america are piss easy
[2:49] <Yourself> AP exams are designed to be difficult
[2:49] <Azathoth> but AP is difficult because it's for college credit
[2:49] <Quatroking> sppt, I'm probably able to, yes, but I'm shitass lazy
[2:49] <sppt> Azathoth, believe me, dutch exams aren't that easy
[2:49] <Azathoth> and college exams typically are very difficult
[2:49] <sppt> or well
[2:49] <Quatroking> Besides, I can make my hobby into my work now
[2:49] <sppt> i dont think so :P
[2:50] <Quatroking> heh
[2:50] <Quatroking> I remember my math exams
[2:50] <sppt> Quatroking, have you ever seen a vmbo kader math exam?
[2:50] <Quatroking> we learned angles for the entire year
[2:50] <Iguana> Was your class full of retards?
[2:50] <Quatroking> and we did NOT have a single one on the exam
[2:50] <Quatroking> Nah
[2:50] <Iguana> Wwas the teacher a retard?
[2:50] <Quatroking> I was on the good side of VMBO
[2:50] <sppt> vmbo kader, oh god
[2:50] <Yourself> anyway, what's the problem with this physics exam?
[2:50] <Azathoth> i miss high school
[2:50] <Quatroking> you had the retards, and the okay folks
[2:50] <sppt> kader is the epitomy of retardedness
[2:50] <Azathoth> it was so slow compared to college
[2:51] <Yourself> it's all the easy parts of physics
[2:51] <Iguana> I WAS THE RETARDS.
[2:51] <Iguana> Amirite.
[2:51] <sppt> or well, i believe there's an even lower level
[2:51] <Quatroking> Yeah
[2:51] <vurtual> those creepers
[2:51] <vurtual> THEY BLEW UP A GRAVE
[2:51] <Quatroking> but then you're not elligible for study
[2:51] <vurtual> :'(
[2:51] <sppt> anyway, i got integrals this year
[2:51] <vurtual> how could theeeey
[2:51] <sppt> that shit's so much fun
[2:51] <Quatroking> I share the building with the level 2 guys
[2:51] <Quatroking> I'm level 4 myself
[2:52] <Quatroking> they spend 2 years on learning how to build a fucking pc and how to take helpdesk calls
[2:52] <vurtual> theeey blew up my buddy's grave
[2:52] <vurtual> whyyyyy
[2:52] <Quatroking> I did all of that in two MONTHS
[2:52] <Azathoth> yourself, that stuff is relatively easy compared to more advanced physics, but it's not EASY for everyone >_>
[2:52] <Quatroking> and my study is 4 years long
[2:52] <Quatroking> BAWWW
[2:52] <sppt> oh god Quatroking
[2:52] <Quatroking> well the lessons material took 2 months
[2:52] <Azathoth> i really struggled through my electromagnetism and optics course
[2:52] <Quatroking> I already knew how to build a pc

[2:53] <Yourself> "here's a wire with current I"
[2:53] <Yourself> "here's a rectangular loop of wire with these dimensions"
[2:54] <Azathoth> it's not usually stated that nicely
[2:54] <Quatroking> I'm switching over from ICT management to Application design next year

[2:54] <Yourself> it's never layed out in steps like that
[2:54] <Yourself> there's usually useless information littered in with it
[2:55] <Quatroking> so sppt
[2:55] <Quatroking> what are you going to study

[2:55] <Quatroking> Isn't that just ICT
[2:55] <EmpiresBane> god damnit guys! you make me feel so young!
[2:55] <Azathoth> sppt, do you realize there's not one person that writes every test in america right?
[2:55] <Azathoth> -right
[2:55] <sppt> i do
[2:56] <Azathoth> it's very dependent on the instructor
[2:56] <sppt> the exams here take years to be prepared and corrected

[2:56] <Quatroking> EmpiresBane, its not like I'm old or something
[2:57] <sppt> you know what they do here? they give you some details about an engine and solar cells, then ask you to calculate the surface area required to meet the standards they set in the assignment
[2:57] <sppt> that is fucking bullshit
[2:57] <sppt> and i don't like it

[2:59] <Quatroking> my case, computers
[2:59] <sppt> ah
[2:59] <Azathoth> because IQ really means something

[2:59] <EmpiresBane> i would have said 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,353

[3:00] <Azathoth> i did
[3:00] <Quatroking> sppt, I'm receiving my first Cisco certificate next month
[3:00] <sppt> nice
[3:00] <Quatroking> Azathoth, i said I can only focus it on one particular subject
[3:00] <Azathoth> oh, do you have one of those classes at your school too, quat?
[3:00] <sppt> a cousin of mine said a friend of his who did mbo informatica is paid 9000 a month including bonusses
[3:00] <Quatroking> uh
[3:00] <Quatroking> wut
[3:00] <sppt> and that's with mbo.
[3:00] <sppt> and a couple of courses in some languages and stuff

[3:01] <EmpiresBane> god! this isn't the military! why are there so many acronyms?

[3:13] <Azathoth> http://www.silverex.org/news/
[3:13] <AndrewPH> mirc is bad
[3:13] <vurtual> mIRC is good.
[3:13] <sppt> why is BUUUUUUUUUUUUULLSHIT
[3:13] <Visiiri> And mIRC > Y-Chat
[3:13] <AndrewPH> sppt, it's called x-chat 2
[3:13] <sppt> which*
[3:13] <sppt> AndrewPH, it says ychat in my titlebar
[3:13] <sppt> ???
[3:13] <AndrewPH> it says ychat
[3:13] <AndrewPH> but
[3:13] <Visiiri> sppt is right, but it's distributed as xchat 2
[3:14] <AndrewPH> it's advertised as x-chat 2
[3:14] <AndrewPH> ^
[3:14] <sppt> yes well
[3:14] <Azathoth> yeah. when you install it, it's YChat. the site says x-chat 2. technically it's x-chat

[3:52] <ClassiestMedic> iron is pretty easy to get
[3:52] <ClassiestMedic> and durable
[3:53] <ClassiestMedic> stone is even better imo
[3:53] <ClassiestMedic> it lasts for a decent amount of time
[3:53] <ClassiestMedic> and VERY easy to get
[3:53] <vurtual> Ceci n'est pas une title screen!
[3:53] <vurtual> "This is not a title screen!"
[3:53] <ClassiestMedic> haha
[3:53] <vurtual> lobster_MB, what kind of ore?
[3:53] <vurtual> generic stone?
[3:53] <lobster_MB> generic stone and iron ore
[3:53] <lobster_MB> tried 'em both
[3:53] <vurtual> hmm
[3:53] <vurtual> tool isn't wearing down, is it?
[3:54] <vurtual> You sure it's a pickaxe and so on, hmm
[3:54] <lobster_MB> it did mine and give me the other type of stone
[3:54] <lobster_MB> tool also isn't wearing down
[3:54] <vurtual> cobblestone?
[3:54] <lobster_MB> nah, the purple-ish one
[3:54] <vurtual> obsidian!?
[3:54] <lobster_MB> with the gravity
[3:54] <vurtual> oh, gravel?
[3:54] <lobster_MB> i never thought of naming it, to be fair
[3:54] * vLK-lap (vLK@c83-254-232-198.bredband.comhem.se) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[3:54] <vurtual> so you're getting gravel via mining? What?
[3:54] <Firetempest> iron and diamond don't save enough time nor will it last that much longer compared to just the shear volume of stone picks you can make for less effort. I like them better for armor.
[3:54] <EmpiresBane> no need. it was named already
[3:55] <vurtual> iron is really much faster, and can mine all the ores, Firetempest
[3:55] * gear1 (amazedchil@adsl-161-130-189.mia.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:55] <vurtual> iron also lasts much longer
[3:55] <EmpiresBane> use a shovel on gravel
[3:55] <vurtual> diamond is many, many many times longer
[3:55] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[3:55] <vurtual> are you using a hook-shaped tool? or a dual-pointed tool?
[3:55] <lobster_MB> vurtual: no, just pickaxing it, but at least it gave me a block as result

[3:59] <vurtual> did you do it wrong?
[3:59] <vurtual> are you acutally preforming the right actions to mine
[3:59] <vurtual> because a bug causing "not being able to mine stone" makes no sense
[4:00] <Firetempest> would deleting the temp folders of minecraft and basically relaunching minecraft fresh work?
[4:00] <Yourself> there
[4:00] <vurtual> uhm, I'm still wondering

[4:04] <vurtual> recently
[4:09] <lobster_MB> well, as recently goes
[4:09] <lobster_MB> last time i played was at my previous savegame
[4:10] <lobster_MB> before my master thesis took up too much time
[4:10] <lobster_MB> so that was some weeks back

[4:47] <shapeshiftr> vurtual, what?
[4:47] <vurtual> especially bigcity
[4:47] <vurtual> I mean really there's no 1-story roofs in the whole map.
[4:47] <shapeshiftr> parkour in a game?
[4:47] <AndrewPH> vurtual, bigcity has doors at the base of some of the buildings which take you to the top
[4:47] <shapeshiftr> other than mirror's edge, that is.
[4:47] <vurtual> unless you walljumped into eternity like a magical wizard, you'd do nothing.
[4:47] <AndrewPH> also double jump and ninja rope
[4:48] <vurtual> that's not parkour! Parkour is not slowly walking up buildings!
[4:48] <vurtual> you do not take the stairs!
[4:48] <shapeshiftr> this is true
[4:48] <Yourself> AndrewPH, link me

[5:43] <EmpiresBane> when torrenting, what are seeds and what are leechers?
[5:44] <Firetempest> seeds are sharing, leechers are downloading
[5:44] <EmpiresBane> hm... thanks
[5:45] <Navineous> Torrenting? Rofl.
[5:46] <Navineous> My cousin torrents alot.
[5:46] <Navineous> I scanned his PC
[5:46] <Navineous> over 75 Trojan horses. xD
[5:46] <Dommys> >implying torrents cause trojans, rather than personal stupidity
[5:46] <Navineous> Sorta...
[5:46] <Furyhunter> Dommys is right, that's an incredibly ignorant assumption
[5:46] <Navineous> he downloaded games that got bad reviews.
[5:46] <EmpiresBane> i wont torrent if there are comments saying that there are viruses
[5:46] <LG_Legacy> If you don't torrent correctly, then you're bount to get viruses and such.
[5:46] <Navineous> like "Viruses inside don't torrent"
[5:46] <Cial> the story of when i snap and kill people
[5:47] <Dommys> Navineos, so that means Torrents are bad?
[5:47] <Navineous> No.
[5:47] <Navineous> I'
[5:47] <Dommys> That your cousin can't read?

[5:51] <EmpiresBane> yeah... if Gish lags your computer, it does
[5:51] <Navineous> I didn't change the color depth...
[5:51] <EmpiresBane> i'm on a laptop and i can run it great

[5:52] <Yourself> so the screen is just black
[5:52] <Yourself> unless i put it in windowed mode
[5:52] <Navineous> I have 2 Monitors >_>
[5:52] <Yourself> then it's fine
[5:52] <Navineous> And it works.
[5:52] <Navineous> Not even in windowed mode
[5:52] <Navineous> in fullscreen too.
[5:52] <Yourself> i have two monitors and it doesn't
[5:52] <Navineous> I have dual monitors and it does xD

[5:53] <Navineous> anyway my graphics card is old
[5:53] <Navineous> it's an "NVidia GeForce 5500 FX"

[5:55] <Yourself> for example, my motherboard's onboard graphics is an nvidia 8 series

[5:58] <Navineous> It's not like I wanna run Crysis on it
[5:58] <Navineous> lulz.
[5:59] <EmpiresBane> finallty
[5:59] <Firetempest> well, it can run minecraft. thats all that really matters right?
[5:59] <Navineous> Is it better than the shit I have?
[6:00] <Navineous> Probally runs faster than the one I have.
[6:00] <Yourself> the video card is 4 generations newer
[6:00] <Firetempest> if its one day newer then shit you have. its better
[6:00] <Yourself> it has 1/3 the RAM of what you currently have
[6:00] <Navineous> I get 80-100 fps running minecraft on this
[6:00] <Yourself> or so you say
[6:00] <Navineous> I can move ram though
[6:00] <Navineous> >_>
[6:00] <Yourself> not sure why you have a machine with 6GB of ram but a video card older than time itself

[6:01] <Firetempest> is your ram swappable with this new board?
[6:01] <Navineous> I bet so.
[6:01] <Navineous> The ram I have is fairly new
[6:01] <Yourself> don't bet
[6:01] <Navineous> And it supports Dual Monitors :D
[6:01] <Firetempest> yeah, dont bet
[6:01] <Yourself> ram has nothing to do with monitors
[6:01] <Navineous> I only have 130gigs on my hardive.
[6:01] <Navineous> I know.
[6:01] <Yourself> that's all the video card
[6:01] <Navineous> The ram I have is 2 years old.
[6:01] <Navineous> It's new.
[6:02] <Kingwolf> or where i can look up how to get to it
[6:02] <Firetempest> new doesn't enter into it
[6:02] <Yourself> the video card you have was two generations old 6 years ago

[6:03] <Yourself> i just can't understand how you ended up with such an old video card in a 64-bit system
[6:04] <Navineous> I have a 32 bit system
[6:04] <Navineous> >_>
[6:04] <Kingwolf> isnvm found it
[6:04] <Yourself> you can't have 6 GB of ram in a 32-bit system
[6:04] <Kingwolf> but its not working dammit
[6:04] <Navineous> O_o
[6:04] <Yourself> the maximum in a 32-bit system is 4
[6:04] <Navineous> I guess my dad lied
[6:04] <Navineous> lemme check
[6:04] <Kingwolf> actually you can yourself
[6:04] <Navineous> brb
[6:04] <Yourself> that's why everyone's moving to 64-bit
[6:04] <Kingwolf> but it requires
[6:04] <Kingwolf> extra stes
[6:04] <Kingwolf> steps*
[6:04] <Navineous> Yep I have 4 GB

[6:15] <Yourself> looks like there are ways around this
[6:15] <Kingwolf> i randomly came across this too
[6:15] <Kingwolf> i forgot what it was called

[6:49] <EmpiresBane> ewhat's its resolution?
[6:50] <vurtual> the TV's probably some kind of HD
[6:50] <vurtual> it's medium-ish
[6:50] <vurtual> It's a bit bigger in physical size than my 22 inch widescreenish and 21 inch very square monitors.
[6:50] <vurtual> and this TV here, that I'm playing on, is about 61 inches.
[6:50] <EmpiresBane> my 22 is 1080p
[6:51] <vurtual> I have a really, realllllllllllllllllly hard time playin console games outside of it

[10:24] <vurtual> tell me
[10:24] <vurtual> do you have a camera?
[10:24] <vurtual> I don't want to be preforming weird balancing acts on my chair when there's a camera

[10:32] <Konogan> As always.
[10:32] <Konogan> Maybe.
[10:32] <eZek0> Why so many lurkers?
[10:33] <Konogan> Can't tell.
[10:33] <Konogan> I mean, I simply don't know.
[10:33] <eZek0> Why not? You should.
[10:33] <Konogan> Should I?
[10:33] <eZek0> You've been here longer than I.
[10:33] <eZek0> Yes.
[10:33] <Konogan> I still don't know.
[10:33] <vurtual> so
[10:33] <eZek0> Damn.
[10:33] <vurtual> The "inverter" is under a logic gate in this
[10:33] <vurtual> I'm not even sure if I should be using it to convert AC to DC
[10:34] <eZek0> What are you trying to do?
[10:34] <vurtual> using it to convert AC to DC
[10:34] <Konogan> Why would you use an inverter to convert AC to DC?
[10:34] <eZek0> Duh.
[10:34] <eZek0> ^
[10:34] <vurtual> it's a logic chip called "inverter"
[10:34] <eZek0> ._.
[10:34] <Konogan> I know that.
[10:34] <eZek0> We get that you're converting AC to DC. Why?
[10:35] <vurtual> I just hooked it up to an AC power source, added an inductor, and now direct current
[10:35] <vurtual> as LED does not run on A/C
[10:35] <Konogan> cause DC is less complicated to work with?
[10:35] <eZek0> what's "it"?
[10:35] <vurtual> http://www.falstad.com/circuit/
[10:35] <eZek0> Ahh.
[10:36] <vurtual> 99% sure this isn't actually how you do this, but it works, and I feel cool :D
[10:36] <Konogan> Lol.
[10:36] <vurtual> hovers between 200 and 250 milliamps
[10:36] <vurtual> going up to 300
[10:38] <Konogan> Electronics <3
[10:38] <vurtual> getting big flashy warning
[10:39] <vurtual> does this mean that having an LED with negative volts is a bad thing!?
[10:39] <Konogan> Maybe.
[10:39] <Konogan> Are you using some kind of software to simulate your circuit?
[10:39] <Konogan> What? negative volts?
[10:40] <eZek0> The link he provided.
[10:40] <eZek0> Go to it, there's a java applet.
[10:40] <vurtual> aaaa
[10:40] <vurtual> I what have I done
[10:40] <vurtual> I added another transformer
[10:40] <vurtual> which rapidly cycles between 480 and -480 volts
[10:40] <Konogan> Actually, if it's DC you only have to reverse the LED's pole.
[10:40] <Konogan> oh.
[10:40] <Konogan> That's AC.
[10:40] <Konogan> Mmmh.
[10:40] <vurtual> INFACT THE WHOLE CIRCUIT IS DOING TIHS
[10:40] <vurtual> Even though I just made DC power
[10:41] <Adurah> http://i.imgur.com/3v4x5.jpg Oh Shiite.
[10:41] <Konogan> That's cause your on AC.
[10:41] <vurtual> at 200+ milliamps.
[10:41] <vurtual> the same would probably happen with a DC current, not in any way made from AC
[10:41] <Konogan> There must be an option to put a DC source in your software.
[10:41] <vurtual> there is
[10:41] <vurtual> I wanted to make DC from AC
[10:42] <Konogan> Alright...
[10:42] <Konogan> Mmmh...
[10:42] <Konogan> You need diodes.
[10:42] <Yourself> <vurtual> I wanted to make DC from AC
[10:42] <Yourself> bridge rectifier
[10:43] <vurtual> anyways kids that's what happens when you cheat and use a hypothetical logic gate
[10:44] <Konogan> Wouldn't a diode on each end of the circuit work?
[10:44] <vurtual> Now the real question is: how am I so capible with real wires?
[10:44] <Yourself> <Konogan> Wouldn't a diode on each end of the circuit work?
[10:44] <Yourself> two diodes would result in you losing half the waveform
[10:45] <Yourself> half the time there'd be no current flowing
[10:45] <vurtual> pardon my complete lack of preconcieved logic
[10:45] <Konogan> ok wait
[10:45] <vurtual> but this "insistor" stores power
[10:45] <Konogan> So we need 2 for AC input and 2 for DC output?
[10:45] <Yourself> <vurtual> but this "insistor" stores power

[11:32] <vurtual> which society would be worse: one where moobs are generally taboo, or boobs are generally taboo?

[11:33] <vurtual> yeah, but what if guys can't become topless?

[18:26] <bildramer> could be improved
[18:26] <bildramer> 80 particles... argh
[18:27] <Siiseli> ... yes could be
[18:27] <bildramer> http://imgur.com/KdfWP.png
[18:27] <bildramer> yes
[18:27] <bildramer> should be
[18:28] <bildramer> pretty
[18:28] <ylt> wow, nice
[18:28] <bildramer> needs more work for a screensaver
[18:28] <bildramer> lol
[18:28] <bildramer> and needs less trying to do nuclear physics
[18:28] <ylt> what language is it?
[18:28] <bildramer> C++
[18:29] <bildramer> running with 320 particles now
[18:29] <ylt> how are you rendering it? opengl/dx?
[18:29] <Siiseli> how the fuck did you make that so slow bildramer
[18:30] <Siiseli> anyway, what's it rendered with
[18:30] <bildramer> ?
[18:30] <bildramer> SDL
[18:30] <Siiseli> right
[18:30] <bildramer> for every pixel I compute the distance to every particle
[18:30] <bildramer> that's why the slowness
[18:30] <Siiseli> jesus
[18:30] <Siiseli> that.. is slow
[18:30] <Siiseli> slowtastic

[18:31] <bildramer> what's that
[18:32] <Siiseli> bildramer, if you don't want color to overflow you could just limit it to a certain range
[18:32] <bildramer> oh
[18:32] <Siiseli> aka. if r>255 r=255
[18:32] <bildramer> true
[18:32] <Siiseli> etc.
[18:32] <bildramer> then it will turn all white instead >_<

[18:32] <Siiseli> well, what would you like to happen
[18:32] <ylt> or could scale it based on number of particles?
[18:32] <Siiseli> yeah
[18:32] <Siiseli> also that
[18:33] <bildramer> ugh divisions
[18:33] <bildramer> I do a square root and a division for every particle 262144 times per frame
[18:33] <ylt> get rid of the square root
[18:33] <bildramer> and still I believe the division takes more time
[18:33] <ylt> i was juast about to mention to get rid of them :p
[18:33] <bildramer> lol
[18:34] <bildramer> actually, that solves the squaring problem
[18:34] <bildramer> let's see how that'll look with 1/r^2
[18:34] <ylt> or... there's a fast square root technique that i've seen before..
[18:34] <bildramer> yes
[18:35] <bildramer> fast inverse square root
[18:35] <bildramer> still needs divides D:

[18:41] <bildramer> alright, let's optimize this shits
[18:41] <TrueWolves> So
[18:41] * bildramer inlines all functions except main()
[18:41] <TrueWolves> Who should I interview first? (given I should have done this a while ago)
[18:41] * TrueWolves wants a mix of regulars and newbies if posiable.
[18:41] <bildramer> (a-b)^2 = a^2+2ab+b^2
[18:41] <Speljohan_> you may interview my penis
[18:41] <bildramer> don't think it will help
[18:42] <ylt> maybe you should have inteviewed about a week ago, before everyone started exams?
[18:42] <bildramer> sub, sub, multiply vs. add, add, multiply, multiply, multiply, multiply
[18:42] <bildramer> true dat
[18:43] <Speljohan_> lolwat
[18:43] <Budda> TrueWolves interview for what
[18:43] <Speljohan_> in sweden exams ended liek months ago
[18:43] <ylt> uk (and i think germany also) are doing it at moment
[18:43] <ylt> no idea about anywhere else
[18:43] <Budda> i have some exams in a few weeks

[18:44] <Budda> but only end of trimester ones, note nd of year
[18:44] * bildramer replaces *256 with <<8
[18:44] * lobster (michielbiq@86.89.201.189) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[18:44] * bildramer is amazed the compiler didn't do this
[18:44] <Speljohan_> anywayz, unless they are uni exams you dont really have to study whatsoever
[18:45] <TrueWolves> Budda, my research for my final school project based on the MineCraft community
[18:45] <ylt> bildramer: nice optimisation (/me fixes server to include it for player coordinates)
[18:45] <Speljohan_> lol
[18:45] <Speljohan_> very much trivial optimization
[18:45] <Speljohan_> but it looks fancier
[18:46] <bildramer> woot
[18:46] <bildramer> almost 4 fps
[18:47] <Budda> project base on mc, rofl
[18:48] <Roadcrosser> is there a sps
[18:48] <Roadcrosser> theres FPS and TPS but SPS?
[18:48] <bildramer> runs smoothly at 256x256
[18:48] <bildramer> :D
[18:48] <Roadcrosser> also what does the S stand for
[18:48] <bildramer> problem #1, particles far away fuck up everything
[18:48] <Roadcrosser> and if there is an SPS what is it
[18:48] <Shadaez> second person shooter

[18:52] <gear1> and closed it again
[18:53] <gear1> also, how is everyone ;3
[18:53] <ylt> nice how windows colour codes match minecraft.. simply convert the hex char into a int.. and pass that to SetConsoleTextAttribute :)
[18:54] <TrueWolves> It be disorentating as hell at first, but a game where you play threw the eyes of those you are fighting would be... well... intresting.
[18:54] <TrueWolves> Any of you up for interviews?
[18:54] <Shadaez> how long
[18:55] <ylt> what about?
[18:55] <TrueWolves> Eh, not sure, about 5~10 minutes maybe
[18:55] <ylt> give some example questions
[18:55] <Shadaez> about horse riding, obviously, ylt
[18:55] <ylt> lol
[18:55] <TrueWolves> I've already said about 10times now it's about the community of Minecraft and your experince with Notch's games and how well you think things are orignized with in the community.

[18:58] * Quatroking puts on his cool shades and lights a ciggie

[19:43] <Kodaichi> niice.
[19:43] <FakeSky_R> Like the same computer with 2 players?
[19:44] <sppt> since it doesn't launch a java process, nor does it have the usual right click menu from flash

[19:52] <Snowman> Don't use it
[19:52] <Marach-18> is it?
[19:52] <Snowman> Code your own webpage
[19:52] <gear1> if i had two of my plugins activated it would cause something to retard-ate
[19:53] <gear1> and if i deleted all the code within
[19:53] <gear1> it would still happen
[19:53] <gear1> so i merged the two plugins
[19:53] <Snowman> gear1, learn HTML and CSS
[19:53] <gear1> and it works fine
[19:53] <Snowman> And make your own site
[19:53] <gear1> oh i know all that

[20:30] <Quatroking> for some reason pacman starts once he starts firefox
[20:30] <Snowman> Protip: Don't use Firefox :3
[20:30] <Dudebro_> No u
[20:30] <Snowman> Opera ftw
[20:31] <Quatroking> snowman, I prefer using a browser with actual features
[20:31] <Snowman> Opera has features
[20:31] <Speljohan_> firefox was good once
[20:31] <Dudebro_> As long as it's not IE
[20:31] <Snowman> Plenty of them
[20:31] <Speljohan_> now it is shit
[20:31] <Speljohan_> and massively bloated
[20:31] <Dudebro_> Or safari
[20:31] <Quatroking> I didn't see the pacman thing yet so I figured he somehow catched a virus
[20:31] <Snowman> Speljohan_, true, it uses 90% of the CPU for me :/
[20:31] <Speljohan_> i stopped using ff after 2
[20:31] <Snowman> And hogs on memory
[20:31] <Quatroking> so yeah his pc is being scanned right now
[20:31] <Quatroking> heh
[20:31] <Snowman> Speljohan_, what browser you use atm?
[20:31] <Speljohan_> chrome
[20:31] <Marach-18> firefox is still best and fastest >:(
[20:31] <Snowman> Ah
[20:31] <Speljohan_> i dislike bloat
[20:31] <Marach-18> i recently compared it to chrome
[20:32] <Snowman> Chrome has nice speed but it lacks buttons
[20:32] <Speljohan_> i like streamlined interfaces
[20:32] <Speljohan_> nd all that
[20:32] <Marach-18> chrome is so much slower than ff
[20:32] * Dudebro_ (Dudebro@166.133.172.82) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:32] <Speljohan_> yeah i dont want any features more than what it has though Snowman
[20:32] <Snowman> It's fine for you then
[20:32] <Quatroking> say, is that pacman thing html5?
[20:32] <Speljohan_> exactly :P
[20:32] <Speljohan_> i'll stop using chrome if they bloat it up though
[20:32] <Dommys> I LOVE BLOAT.
[20:32] <Snowman> Opera is the crossing between Firefox and Chrome
[20:32] <Dommys> It reminds me of a FAT SWEATY chick.
[20:32] <Speljohan_> yeh
[20:33] <Marach-18> Speljohan_: firefox isn't bloated. prove me otherwise

[20:33] <Marach-18> what features would you remove?
[20:33] <Speljohan_> Marach-18 it feels bulky, it has tons of features i will never use and it has bad startup time
[20:33] <Snowman> Marach-18, let me start up Firefox and Opera
[20:33] <Speljohan_> also it hogs more memory than chrome
[20:33] <Marach-18> yeah, but i prefer a fast browser over lightweight one
[20:34] * Cial (Mibbit@68.170.96.228) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[20:34] <Quatroking> I prefer a browser which I can customize to my personal needs
[20:34] <Quatroking> thus, firefox
[20:34] <Dommys> My firefox takes like 1 additional second than chrome to load. lol
[20:34] <Speljohan_> pretty sure the speed difference is incredibly small
[20:34] <Speljohan_> cus
[20:34] <Speljohan_> before firefox 3.5 or wutever
[20:34] <Marach-18> and chrome is even worse than ie
[20:34] <Speljohan_> chrome was fastest
[20:34] <Speljohan_> uhh what Marach-18
[20:34] <Speljohan_> nothing is worse than ie
[20:34] <Marach-18> at least in ie i can scroll pages without waiting 2 seconds
[20:34] <Snowman> Let me open my browser, then navigate to Youtube
[20:34] <Speljohan_> wtf
[20:35] <Marach-18> and ie doesn't freeze unless page is completely loaded
[20:35] <Speljohan_> i have no problems with that whatsoever Marach-18
[20:35] <Kodaichi> sonic 4 says its release date is confirmed
[20:35] <Kodaichi> "fall 2010" is NOT a release date
[20:35] <Speljohan_> chrome has never frozen for me, and i've used it since beta
[20:35] <Marach-18> i mean
[20:35] <Speljohan_> a tab has frozen ONCE
[20:35] <Kodaichi> it needs to be more specific :(
[20:35] <Marach-18> it doesn't respond until all images are loaded
[20:35] <Speljohan_> because of a stupid applet
[20:35] <Speljohan_> but that applet didnt run on any browser
[20:35] <Speljohan_> lol
[20:35] <Speljohan_> wrong Marach-18
[20:35] <Marach-18> right
[20:35] <Speljohan_> you must be very outdated
[20:35] <Speljohan_> because it works fine for me
[20:35] <Dommys> Speljohan is this your favorite band? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP_C8IamUSI
[20:36] <Speljohan_> and frankly, i cant remember it ever being a problem
[20:36] <Marach-18> Speljohan_: there's no point saying something is fast because your ps is fast
[20:36] <Marach-18> at least my pc is slow enough to compare browsers
[20:36] <Speljohan_> that was fucking bad Dommys
[20:36] <Snowman> Firefox spiked to 46% CPU usage and 66000K memory on startup. Navigating to Youtube spikes to 32% CPU and 69000 memory.
[20:36] <Quatroking> dommys
[20:36] <Quatroking> this is my favorite band: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxi7JRJrod4
[20:36] <Snowman> Now, Opera
[20:36] <Marach-18> Snowman: i don't care about memory
[20:37] <Speljohan_> you should if your pc is as slow as you say it is
[20:37] <Speljohan_> lol
[20:37] <Marach-18> i have 512mb ram
[20:37] <sppt> i dont care about memory either, so i've got opera caching 200mb of data to my ram
[20:37] <Quatroking> snowman: have 4GB of RAM and a 3GHZ quadcore, that means I want to waste it on bulky software
[20:37] <Quatroking> fuck lightweight
[20:37] <Marach-18> and everything but windows is placed in pagefile anyway
[20:37] <Marach-18> so it doesn't matter
[20:37] <sppt> so it's typically using around 300mb of ram with usually 10+ tabs open
[20:37] <Speljohan_> Marach-18, 512mb ram, then it's no wonder browsers are fucking slow
[20:37] <Snowman> 40% CPU and 63000K memory. Navigating to youtube takes 12% CPU and 65000K memory
[20:37] <Quatroking> boohoo
[20:37] <Marach-18> Speljohan_: nope, chrome only!
[20:37] <Snowman> Quatroking, sure, I'dlike to waste it on bulky software as well
[20:37] <Marach-18> *browser*, not browsers
[20:38] <Speljohan_> that is odd Marach-18
[20:38] <Speljohan_> because on my dad's pc (512mb ram, 2.0ghz p4)
[20:38] <Snowman> But a browser shouldn't be bulky enough to use half a CPU
[20:38] <Speljohan_> ie is slowest
[20:38] <Speljohan_> with ff being considerably faster
[20:38] <Quatroking> the thing I'm saying is, it runs great on my pc even while I'm using a shitload of other programs
[20:38] <Speljohan_> then opera
[20:38] <Speljohan_> and lastly chrome
[20:38] <Snowman> And Firefox freezes for a few millisecs when performing some actions as well
[20:38] <Speljohan_> as fastest
[20:38] <Quatroking> I don't give a shit if it runs slow for other people
[20:38] <Speljohan_> might want to note he runs windows xp
[20:38] <Marach-18> i haven't had a single issue with ff
[20:38] <Marach-18> i have xp too
[20:38] <Quatroking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxi7JRJrod4
[20:38] <Speljohan_> yeh Quatroking

[20:41] <Marach-18> or images
[20:41] <Snowman> lol,text is so 1996
[20:41] <Kodaichi> it's all in the number
[20:41] <Speljohan_> and 1996 was glory days of internet
[20:41] <Speljohan_> !
[20:41] <Kodaichi> 1: that's terror.
[20:41] <Kodaichi> 2: that's terror.
[20:41] <Snowman> If you can call Web 1.0 the glory days
[20:42] <Marach-18> we can
[20:42] <Speljohan_> ^
[20:42] <Snowman> Not the glory imho
[20:42] <Snowman> I like to pick my nose
[20:42] <Kodaichi> it was slow though.
[20:42] <Snowman> Beans might be useful
[20:42] <Quatroking> gotta love the talking chopper in Deus Ex
[20:42] <Quatroking> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG1qKzIsisU
[20:42] <Kodaichi> what are we waiting for?
[20:42] <Speljohan_> i think what really destroyed the internetz was flash
[20:42] <Kodaichi> i dont know
[20:42] <Quatroking> "its a bomb!" "a bomb!"
[20:42] <Speljohan_> when flash started popping up on websites all hell broke loose
[20:43] <Quatroking> not really
[20:43] <Marach-18> yeah :(
[20:43] <Marach-18> INTROS
[20:43] <Speljohan_> there's NOTHING in the world that is more fucking retarded than websites in flash
[20:43] <Quatroking> IE not following W3 standards
[20:43] <Wervyn> Man, how many of you people are even old enough to be talking like you fondly remember the 90s? How old were you in 1996, two?
[20:43] <Kodaichi> I can only imagine how many people have pirated flash
[20:43] <sppt> i was 5 and i didnt have interwebs back then :D
[20:43] <sppt> what do i win?
[20:43] <Kodaichi> lol
[20:43] <Quatroking> I remember the days of dialup
[20:43] <Speljohan_> loll
[20:43] <Quatroking> ah
[20:43] <sppt> dialup lool
[20:43] <Kodaichi> I remember dialup
[20:43] <Speljohan_> we all do
[20:43] <sppt> we had isdn
[20:44] <Speljohan_> we never had isdn
[20:44] <sppt> in fact
[20:44] <Kodaichi> I used to go on funnyjunk.com
[20:44] <Speljohan_> we had 56k dial up
[20:44] <sppt> we didnt cancel our isdn subscription until 2 months ago
[20:44] <Speljohan_> however, all this is irrelevant
[20:44] <Kodaichi> and look at shitty mario fansites
[20:44] <Marach-18> the hell is isdn?
[20:44] <Speljohan_> the 80's are still > 90's
[20:44] <Speljohan_> and > this era as well
[20:44] <Wervyn> I remember when 56k was a major upgrade to our 14.4kbps modem.
[20:44] <sppt> Marach-18, it's slightly faster interwebs
[20:44] * Hideous (His_Ugline@81-236-232-200-no30.tbcn.telia.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[20:44] <Marach-18> faster than?
[20:44] <sppt> 64 kbps woo!
[20:45] <sppt> faster than 56k
[20:45] <Speljohan_> 56*
[20:45] <sppt> lol
[20:45] <Speljohan_> in fact
[20:45] <sppt> no isdn was 64 kbits
[20:45] <Kodaichi> that's still not as fast as sonic
[20:45] <Speljohan_> 56,6*
[20:45] <Kodaichi> lol
[20:45] <Speljohan_> lele
[20:45] <Speljohan_> my rich friend had 128kbps idsn
[20:45] <sppt> well actually it's supposed to be 128 kbits
[20:45] <Speljohan_> dual connections
[20:45] * Evicous (chatzilla@c-69-244-48-242.hsd1.az.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:45] <Speljohan_> etc
[20:45] <sppt> but that's only possible when you have 2 connections or some bullshit
[20:45] <Speljohan_> ye
[20:46] <sppt> and then we got adsl
[20:46] <sppt> from 64 kbits to i believe 384 kbits
[20:46] <Speljohan_> we got adsl in like 2000 or 20001
[20:46] <Speljohan_> 500kbps
[20:46] <sppt> that was quite an improvement
[20:46] <sppt> we got it in 2003
[20:46] <Speljohan_> then in 2003 we got 24/1 connection
[20:46] <Speljohan_> and we've had it ever since
[20:46] <Speljohan_> l0l
[20:46] <sppt> and well, this year i should be getting VDSL2
[20:46] <sppt> so it'll be upped to 16/2
[20:46] <Speljohan_> we already have that shit
[20:46] <sppt> no you dont
[20:47] <sppt> yours is 24/1
[20:47] <Speljohan_> ye we do
[20:47] <sppt> mine is 16/2
[20:47] <Speljohan_> ...
[20:47] <Speljohan_> i mean vdsl
[20:47] <Speljohan_> silly
[20:47] <sppt> yeah well im getting vdsl2
[20:47] <sppt> which wasnt standardized until 2006
[20:47] <Speljohan_> ye i mean vdsl2
[20:47] <sppt> !
[20:47] <Speljohan_> but the 2 is redundant
[20:47] <Speljohan_> just like in adsl
[20:47] <sppt> orly
[20:48] <Speljohan_> i mean, it's not like adsl exists anymore
[20:48] <Quatroking> eh
[20:48] <sppt> it's two different standards...
[20:48] <Speljohan_> when someone says adsl you assume adsl2+
[20:48] <Quatroking> yes it does
[20:48] <Speljohan_> what really
[20:48] <Quatroking> oh
[20:48] <Quatroking> Yeah, thats true
[20:48] <Speljohan_> it disappeared from sweden a few years ago
[20:48] <Speljohan_> lol
[20:48] <sppt> i got adsl atm
[20:48] <Speljohan_> along with dial up
[20:48] <sppt> regular adsl
[20:48] <Speljohan_> and other shit
[20:48] <sppt> not adsl2
[20:48] <sppt> nor adsl2+
[20:48] <Speljohan_> noob
[20:49] <sppt> blame my isp for being stupid
[20:49] <Speljohan_> apparently we're getting fibre in 2 years as well
[20:49] <Marach-18> die and get ethernet
[20:49] <Speljohan_> i think that sucks major hog-anus though
[20:49] <sppt> they only recently started offering vdsl2
[20:49] <Speljohan_> government spending hundreds of millions on internetz when we have more important and emergent problems to deal with
[20:49] <Speljohan_> idiets
[20:50] <sppt> the lines here arent actually funded by da government iirc
[20:50] <sppt> it's all some random company
[20:50] <sppt> yeah tis a private company these days
[20:50] <Speljohan_> the lines are owned by private company here too
[20:51] <Speljohan_> but faggot government funds them
[20:51] <sppt> lol
[20:51] <Dommys> Free government internet is free monitored internet.
[20:51] <Speljohan_> paranoia

[20:55] <Quatroking> don't expect him to know how technology works
[20:55] <Marach-18> he is fucking lying all the time
[20:55] <Marach-18> i have a hp
[20:55] <Wervyn> Marach uses "A gray one".
[20:55] <Quatroking> "why this floppy no fit??" *smashes a pc-card into an SD cardreader*
[20:55] <Marach-18> lol
[20:55] <Speljohan_> <Marach-18> he is fucking lying all the time
[20:55] <Speljohan_> <Marach-18> i have a hp
[20:55] <Speljohan_> ahahhahhahahhaah
[20:55] <Quatroking> that summarizes marach's knowledge about computer
[20:56] <Speljohan_> that was glorious
[20:56] <Marach-18> Speljohan_: i can take a pic
[20:56] * Quatroking facedesks
[20:56] * Speljohan_ facepalm
[20:56] <Speljohan_> you are making the better and better every second that goes by Marach-18
[20:56] <Speljohan_> this*
[20:56] <Quatroking> the only good hp's are the ones that still say hewlett packard on them
[20:56] <Speljohan_> ^
[20:57] <Speljohan_> and the laptops
[20:57] <Speljohan_> they are still great
[20:57] <Quatroking> (the old ones with pentium overdrive)
[20:57] <Speljohan_> loll
[20:57] <Marach-18> what
[20:57] <Speljohan_> hp makes great business class laptops at least
[20:57] <Speljohan_> i dunno about the rest
[20:57] <bildramer> 21580
[20:57] <Marach-18> i don't need a fastest pc
[20:57] <bildramer> why is it so addictive?
[20:57] <Speljohan_> bildramer
[20:57] <Speljohan_> numbers??
[20:57] <Speljohan_> 76
[20:57] <Speljohan_> 75
[20:57] <Marach-18> at least mine doesn't overheat, like bildramer's dell
[20:57] <Speljohan_> 74
[20:57] <Speljohan_> 98
[20:58] <Speljohan_> :D
[20:58] <Speljohan_> Ehh, Coming
[20:58] <Speljohan_> NOT IN THE FACE NOT IN THE FACE
[20:58] <Marach-18> unlike*
[20:58] <Speljohan_> OWWW MY EYE
[20:58] <Jat> a premade computer that overheats?
[20:58] <Speljohan_> EEUUGHH THE HUMANITY
[20:58] <Marach-18> jat: welcome to dell
[20:58] <Speljohan_> wow
[20:58] <Jat> QUALITY
[20:58] <Aeomin> lol
[20:58] <Marach-18> ask bild
[20:58] <bildramer> I could spend the whole day playing pacman
[20:58] <bildramer> :/
[20:58] <Speljohan_> usually the prebuilt pc's dont overheat easily
[20:59] <bildramer> yes
[20:59] <bildramer> it overheats
[20:59] <Speljohan_> that's fucking terrible
[20:59] <Speljohan_> something must clearly be broken
[20:59] <Jat> i know they dont theyre not supposed to
[20:59] <bildramer> 70-80 degrees Celsius if the fans are left to the standard settings
[20:59] <Jat> so if it overheats someone really fucked up
[20:59] <bildramer> 50% fucking CPU
[20:59] <Speljohan_> rifk bildramer
[20:59] <bildramer> if it's 100% even high fans never save me
[20:59] <Jat> rifk
[20:59] <bildramer> good I have 2 cores
[20:59] <Speljohan_> my cpu fan is always on lowest possible setting (you can barely hear it)
[20:59] <Jat> maybe they did not put any thermal paste on the cpu
[20:59] <Speljohan_> and it never goes beyond 60c
[20:59] <Speljohan_> even on max load
[20:59] <bildramer> I thought of that too
[20:59] <Marach-18> i love loud hd's :D
[21:00] <bildramer> dunno what thermal paste is
[21:00] <bildramer> lel
[21:00] <Speljohan_> my hdd is fairly loud
[21:00] <Aeomin> Maxtor HDD..LOUD
[21:00] <Speljohan_> but everything else
[21:00] <Speljohan_> except for my gfx card
[21:00] <Marach-18> and i have 2 hd's here
[21:00] <Speljohan_> is completely silent
[21:00] <Marach-18> so i get a fucking stereo at startup
[21:00] <Jat> thermal paste is the stuff you put between the heatsink on the cpu and the cpu itself to transfer heat from the cpu to the heatsink
[21:00] <Speljohan_> aaaaah Aeomin
[21:00] <Speljohan_> maxtor diamondmax 9 series
[21:00] <Speljohan_> i had 6 of those
[21:00] <Speljohan_> all broke
[21:00] <bildramer> on Google "This should stay permanent. Maybe update a different game each week."
[21:00] <Speljohan_> in exactly the same way
[21:00] <sppt> lold
[21:00] <Speljohan_> all in different pc's
[21:00] <sppt> used to have those as well
[21:00] <Speljohan_> my brother got one for his pc
[21:00] <Marach-18> bildramer: ?
[21:00] <Speljohan_> it broke in the same damn way
[21:00] <bildramer> "You can almost hear the world's productivity decreasing. I expect the stock market to crash."
[21:01] <bildramer> lol comments
[21:01] <Aeomin> I might switch to WD Caviar Green
[21:01] <Marach-18> lol
[21:01] <Speljohan_> i'm on an old samsung ide 320gb Aeomin

[21:01] <bildramer> rofl 2 player game! :D
[21:01] <Speljohan_> i'd never buy an ssd this early
[21:01] <Marach-18> whaat
[21:01] * Marach-18 checks
[21:01] <Speljohan_> too unreliable unless you buy the really expensive ones
[21:02] <sppt> Speljohan_, did you hear theyve made a nand chip for ssd's that's capable of 10gb/s
[21:02] <Aeomin> Never had samsung hdd
[21:02] <Speljohan_> yes sppt
[21:02] <sppt> but it use platinum, bismuth and strontium
[21:02] <Speljohan_> samsung is pretty reliable aem
[21:02] <Aeomin> had Hitachi before though.. and that thing is..ergh..
[21:02] <Speljohan_> Aeomin*
[21:02] <sppt> so ye, gg @ expensive SSDs
[21:02] <Speljohan_> Aeomin, i've had this hdd since 2002
[21:02] <Speljohan_> has yet to fail me
[21:02] <Speljohan_> so yeah, it's reliable alright :)
[21:02] <Aeomin> nice
[21:02] <sppt> i've got two samsung HD103UJ drives for data storage
[21:02] <Speljohan_> oh and my pc is on nearly 24/7
[21:02] <bildramer> it's ridiculously hard to control 2 pacmans at once
[21:02] <bildramer> lel
[21:02] <sppt> 2tb total :>
[21:02] <Speljohan_> so it's susprising it have not died yet

[21:04] <Speljohan_> !
[21:04] <Dommys> Speljohan next fall
[21:04] <Dommys> 2tbs will be cheap enough to go that route :D
[21:04] <Marach-18> bildramer: what's the insert coin key? it starts automatically
[21:04] <Speljohan_> hmm, true Dommys
[21:04] <Jat> its replacing the i feel lucky button
[21:04] <Speljohan_> the only reason i'm doing this is because i'm moving
[21:04] <Speljohan_> and i won't be having the vinyls
[21:05] <Speljohan_> lol
[21:05] <Jat> also if you insert another coin ms pacman appaers and you can play two handed pacman
[21:05] <Dommys> And if you're feeling really frisky... you can buy a SSD to rip the albums onto.. and then transfer them to storage
[21:05] <Aeomin> is 2TB reliable yet?
[21:05] <Dommys> Meh
[21:05] <Dommys> Reliable enough for storage
[21:06] <bildramer> Marach-18 wat
[21:06] <bildramer> english version of course
[21:06] <Dommys> I wouldn't partition it and use it for everything
[21:06] <bildramer> Insert Coin
[21:06] <bildramer> near Google Search

[21:06] <bildramer> the big gray button
[21:06] <Marach-18> didn't see that
[21:06] <bildramer> press twice
[21:06] <Dommys> 64mb cache helps, though
[21:07] <Speljohan_> i reckon i have about 10-11tb worth of flac vinyls
[21:07] <Dommys> Just rip it to wav
[21:07] <Dommys> lol

[22:10] <Speljohan_> the green in sweden arent even interested in environment
[22:10] <blaster> They want to legalize all currently illigal drugs
[22:10] <Speljohan_> its just a fucking facade
[22:10] <Speljohan_> it's like

[22:11] <Speljohan_> who gives a fuck if some idiot goes and dies from an overdose
[22:11] <Speljohan_> not my problem
[22:11] <blaster> Speljohan drugs cause brain damage
[22:12] <blaster> We dont need more retards being a burden on society
[22:12] <Speljohan_> lold
[22:12] <Speljohan_> "drugs" cannot be generalized as one category
[22:12] <Speljohan_> that's like saying "FOOD GIVES CANCER"
[22:13] <sppt> blaster, then they should ban cigarettes and alcohol
[22:13] <Speljohan_> ^
[22:13] <sppt> and caffeine i spose
[22:13] <Speljohan_> they are way more dangerous than many illegal drugs
[22:13] <blaster> sppt they should
[22:13] <sppt> and chocolate, because women are addicted to it
[22:13] <blaster> They should ban all of those
[22:13] <blaster> Because they create a large burden
[22:13] <Speljohan_> alcohol would have been banned long ago
[22:13] <sppt> exactly what Speljohan_ said
[22:13] <Speljohan_> but it won't happen
[22:13] <blaster> Chocolate, although addictive, cannot instantly cause body damage
[22:13] <Speljohan_> people would revolt
[22:13] <sppt> if alcohol was invented these days
[22:13] <blaster> Speljohan they would
[22:13] <sppt> it would've been instabanned
[22:13] <Speljohan_> alcohol doesn't instantly create body damage blaster
[22:14] <Speljohan_> and marijuana most certainly does not
[22:14] <blaster> There would be 3,000,000 drunken retards storming parliment
[22:14] <sppt> neither does weed
[22:14] <Speljohan_> takes many many years to notice any negative effects from weed
[22:14] <blaster> Alcohol damages nerve connectors
[22:14] <Speljohan_> yes
[22:14] <blaster> Marijuana slowly kills brain cells
[22:14] <sppt> and that's if you smoke regularly

[22:20] <Speljohan_> etc
[22:20] <Speljohan_> maximize profit
[22:20] <bildramer> ...there are like 999 isotopes that could decay into polonium
[22:20] <Speljohan_> eg faggotry
[22:20] <bildramer> lol
[22:20] <Jat> wat
[22:20] <blaster> Hoping farmers will smoke enough to fumigate their farm
[22:20] <Jat> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium#Commercial_products_containing_polonium
[22:20] <bildramer> I'm not even exaggerating
[22:20] <gear1> if you say you never plan to do drugs
[22:20] <bildramer> I mean things that decay to polonium, er...
[22:21] <Speljohan_> it is quite rare indeed gear1
[22:21] <bildramer> <Jat> polonium is one of the decay products from one of the things in tobacco
[22:21] <sppt> ps the reason why marijuana can help if you got cancer: One possible explanation for the new findings, he said, is that THC, a chemical in marijuana smoke, may encourage aging cells to die earlier and therefore be less likely to undergo cancerous transformation.
[22:21] <bildramer> nuclear tobacco
[22:21] <gear1> i hope you considered all the pain killers you may have ever taken
[22:21] <bildramer> yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
[22:21] <sppt> it's from what i linked before
[22:21] <Speljohan_> i smoke weed perhaps 3 times per 6 months or so
[22:21] <Speljohan_> mostly because i generally don't like it much
[22:21] <Jat> yeah i forgot what it was but theres something in the tobacco that actually decays into polonium somethingorother
[22:21] <bildramer> gear1, no painkillers
[22:21] <gear1> and any medicine for anything ever
[22:21] <bildramer> except if I was a baby
[22:21] <bildramer> also whatever, medicine
[22:21] <bildramer> meh
[22:21] <blaster> Sppt that would just mean you kill many cells
[22:21] <bildramer> ...
[22:21] <gear1> my mother is "anti drugs"
[22:21] <Speljohan_> i heard cells do not regenerate
[22:21] <bildramer> blaster, read up on not being stupid
[22:21] <gear1> she takes sleeping pills
[22:22] <blaster> Your oldest cells are your brain cells, which are more or less the same as they were since you were 14
[22:22] <gear1> and im like really?
[22:22] <Speljohan_> lol gear1
[22:22] <sppt> well it kills them to prevent cells from mutating
[22:22] <bildramer> blaster, read up on news
[22:22] <Quatroking> any forum moderator up in this bitch
[22:22] <gear1> she takes anti anxiety meds
[22:22] <bildramer> brain keeps developing etc.
[22:22] <Speljohan_> my mom occasionally does xtacy
[22:22] <Speljohan_> but then, she behaves like a 20 yr old
[22:22] <Jat> actually wikipedia says the polonium 210 just comes directly from fertilizer
[22:22] <Speljohan_> and she is 42
[22:22] <blaster> Brain is already 100% size at about 14
[22:22] <Jat> oh well whatever
[22:22] <gear1> if my mom took all her sleeping pills
[22:22] <gear1> and i smoked all my weed
[22:22] <bildramer> blaster, ...
[22:22] <gear1> guess who would die
[22:22] <bildramer> lol
[22:22] <bildramer> hm
[22:22] <Jat> oh now i know what im thinking of
[22:22] <Quatroking> I hate the minecraft community: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=13258&start=30
[22:22] <bildramer> polonium
[22:23] <Jat> i think im thinking of polonium decaying into lead
[22:23] <Jat> in the lungs
[22:23] <Quatroking> TWO POSTS AFTER THE WARNING some idiot flames another guy
[22:23] <Quatroking> do these people even try to read other posts?
[22:23] <sppt> gear1, your mother would, thc is only lethal if you get like 3kg in 15 mins inside you
[22:23] <blaster> Sppt it still does damage over time
[22:23] <bildramer> ...omg religion omg
[22:23] <sppt> or not
[22:23] <bildramer> -_____-
[22:23] <blaster> Religion is gay

[22:24] <gear1> i know sppt
[22:24] <sppt> because it can prevent a cell mutating into a tumor cell
[22:24] <gear1> my point exactly
[22:24] <bildramer> Jat, if polonium gets in the lungs you already have a bigger problem
[22:24] <blaster> sppt a better way to prevent cancer
[22:24] <Quatroking> if we didn't have religion we'd be traveling through dimensions just to go to our jobs and school
[22:24] <blaster> Just fucking kill the person
[22:24] <sppt> ok, then why don't you go shoot yourself
[22:24] <sppt> have fun.
[22:24] <Jat> bildramer im not talking about the relative risks im just talking about me forgetting what the hell i was talking about
[22:25] <Jat> or thinking of
[22:25] <bildramer> lol
[22:25] <bildramer> ok
[22:25] <Jat> or something
[22:25] <blaster> How is a society supposed to function if everyone is contantly high?
[22:25] <gear1> no one is saying people should be constantly high
[22:25] <sppt> you know, i don't just smoke weed for fun, if i stand for more than an hour, everything goes sore due to my bowlegs
[22:25] <gear1> we have alcohol, and the world isnt constantly drunk
[22:25] <sppt> and i recently found out that if all goes sore, weed relieves the pain

[22:27] <gear1> it was once
[22:27] <bildramer> lol

[22:27] <Speljohan_> yes gear1
[22:27] <Speljohan_> yeah
[22:27] <liq3> Speljohan_: I do. It's pretty pointless to make it illegal though.
[22:27] <Speljohan_> the smuggling etc
[22:27] <liq3> You'll just get huge amounts of blackmarket alcohol.
[22:27] <bildramer> how's that effect called?
[22:27] <Speljohan_> liq3, i don't because i love alcohol
[22:27] <Speljohan_> as in
[22:27] <bildramer> you forbid somethng, it gets more popular
[22:27] <bildramer> and wanted
[22:27] <Speljohan_> not the alcohol itself
[22:27] <Speljohan_> but the vast amount of liquors available
[22:28] <blaster> The UK is fucked unless the situation here is changed quickly anyway
[22:28] <Speljohan_> not to mention beer
[22:28] <liq3> I've yet to have an alcoholic drink that tasted good.
[22:28] <bildramer> my father has actually drunk 100% ethanol once
[22:28] <bildramer> lol, mistaken for water
[22:28] <Speljohan_> really liq3
[22:28] <liq3> I haven't had much (only 1-2 wines, sip of beer and some brandy).

[22:28] <Speljohan_> i am a huge beer/whiskey/rum man

[22:29] <gear1> sangria is so good
[22:29] <Speljohan_> i generally avoid weed despite most my friends smoking on a regular basis
[22:29] <Snowman> Makes everything better

[22:29] <gear1> im picking up a few LSD stamps after work o_o
[22:29] <liq3> I'd much rather be the guy who has tons of fun WITHOUT alcohol.
[22:29] <Snowman> Drugs suck though
[22:29] <liq3> I don't like be reliant on a drug.
[22:29] <blaster> Gear1 do you want me to call the cops or something?
[22:29] <Speljohan_> i can have tons of fun either way liq3
[22:29] <gear1> go on and do it
[22:30] * blaster calls cops and reports this whole conversation to them
[22:30] <Speljohan_> i don't drink to get drunk
[22:30] <gear1> SOME GUY ON THE INTERNET SAID HES GONNA BUY DRUGS
[22:30] <bildramer> Does anyone here want to play Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots with me and Speljohan_?
[22:30] <Dommys> Yay for straight edge.
[22:30] <liq3> Speljohan_: Not really talking about you. More people like Snowman.
[22:30] * blaster realises that I cannot phone the american police
[22:30] <Speljohan_> o ok
[22:30] <bildramer> heh
[22:30] <liq3> Those people who couldn't imagine a party WITHOUT alcohol.
[22:30] <Speljohan_> well, i haven't ever been to a party without alcohol here really
[22:30] <gear1> parties can be fun without alcohol
[22:30] <Speljohan_> lol
[22:30] <gear1> but if everyone is drunk
[22:30] <gear1> god damn its like fun x 100
[22:31] <Speljohan_> mostly because i only hang out with 80's heavy metal people
[22:31] <Speljohan_> and drinking is part of the lifestyle
[22:31] <Dommys> I drink. 1 beer. Then I'm done for the night..
[22:31] <blaster> Gear thats because your main brain shuts down
[22:31] <liq3> gear1: i'd rather do the ffun x100 without alcohol.
[22:31] <blaster> Due to the nerve connectors no longer functioning
[22:31] <bildramer> blaster

[22:31] <Speljohan_> if everyone is wasted it sucks ass
[22:31] <liq3> Fun without the brain damage. :D
[22:31] <Speljohan_> seriously
[22:31] <Snowman> I'm not saying I can't have fun without alcohol
[22:31] <Snowman> And too drunk is bad as well
[22:31] <liq3> Neither am I.
[22:31] <Speljohan_> yeah Snowman
[22:31] <Speljohan_> nothing is more retarded
[22:31] <Snowman> But a few drinks are great
[22:31] <Speljohan_> than kids drinking
[22:31] <Snowman> Kids shouldn't drink
[22:31] <Speljohan_> because they drink until they drop
[22:31] <Speljohan_> i agree
[22:32] <blaster> nothing is more retarded than humanity right now
[22:32] <liq3> I'm just saying those people who 'need' a few drinks to 'losen up'. I'd rather not be reliant on a drug for that.
[22:32] <Speljohan_> correct blaster
[22:32] <blaster> Its like, we eat poison
[22:32] <Snowman> I advocate any alcoholic beverage should be 18+
[22:32] <Speljohan_> blaster, we have done that for thousands of years
[22:32] <Speljohan_> it's nothing new
[22:32] <blaster> If it was not for hospitals natural selection would of turned us all into superintelligent beings
[22:32] <Dommys> Age limits on alcohol are retarded.
[22:32] <gear1> I advocate learning about alcohol at a young age
[22:32] <liq3> ^
[22:32] <Dommys> Maturity limit on alcohol make sense, though.
[22:32] <Speljohan_> yes
[22:32] <bildramer> ...?
[22:32] <Speljohan_> but not from friends
[22:32] <bildramer> yes

[22:33] <Dommys> liq3 yes.
[22:33] <Snowman> Like the internet
[22:33] <Speljohan_> my first drink was on a party with dad when i saw 15
[22:33] <Quatroking> your mom is an alcohol license
[22:33] <Speljohan_> was*
[22:33] <Dommys> Breeding License, PLEASE'
[22:33] <Speljohan_> as in, my first time being drunk
[22:33] <liq3> Quatroking: fuck no.
[22:33] <Speljohan_> i agree Dommys
[22:33] <liq3> Parents are terrible at stopping people from drinking.
[22:33] <bildramer> ^
[22:33] <Speljohan_> clearly
[22:33] <bildramer> So are most teachers
[22:33] <Dommys> "If you cannot read, you cannot breed"
[22:33] <bildramer> so yeah
[22:34] <Wervyn> It's a fun idea. Wouldn't accomplish much though. Think about how many licensed drivers can't drive for shit.
[22:34] <liq3> I've never been drunk.
[22:34] <Speljohan_> drugs are in many ways part of human nature though
[22:34] <Quatroking> yess

[22:34] <Quatroking> what about blind people
[22:34] <bildramer> lel
[22:34] <liq3> I intend to never experience it.
[22:34] <Dommys> blaster then they should be punished.
[22:34] <liq3> Speljohan_: human nature? pffft.
[22:34] <Speljohan_> that's a dumb attitude tbh liq3
[22:34] <blaster> Welll it wont work in the UK because the police just sit on their ass signing forms all day
[22:34] <Speljohan_> you can't say something is bad without trying
[22:34] <Quatroking> dommys what if a woman goes blind one week before the delivery
[22:34] <Speljohan_> i am open minded
[22:34] <Quatroking> KILL THE INFIDEL
[22:34] <liq3> Speljohan_: I have tried it. Last time I drank was 2 shots. Got a massive headache from it.
[22:34] <Speljohan_> i've tried several heavy drugs, none interested me though
[22:34] <Speljohan_> therefore i can say they suck
[22:34] <sppt> what drugs did you try Speljohan_
[22:35] <Dommys> ./ignore Quatro

[22:37] <Speljohan_> not entirely liq3
[22:37] <Speljohan_> if they really wanted to stop they could

[22:39] <blaster> Speljohan it should be illigal to smoke

[22:39] <bildramer> hey Cowie`
[22:39] <bildramer> want some RoN?
[22:39] <Cowie`> Ummmmmmm, yeah I will do in 5
[22:39] <blaster> Dommys the smoke can stay in your lungs for 30 mineuts after smoking
[22:39] <gear1> it should not be illegal to smoke, people should be allowed to do as they please as long as it does not hurt others
[22:39] <Cowie`> So blaster, whats this about drugs are bad and nothing is addictive.
[22:39] <Cowie`> at all.
[22:39] <Dommys> blaster smoking is delicious. Especially meth.
[22:39] <blaster> so breathing out will still cause secondhand smoke after
[22:40] <Speljohan_> blaster seriously though, you should really educate yourself

[22:41] <liq3> ...No, worth it.
[22:41] <Wervyn> Alcohol?
[22:41] <Speljohan_> piracy does way more damage than drugs
[22:41] <liq3> It's not worth making it illegal. :(
[22:41] <bildramer> loooooooooooooooool
[22:41] <Wervyn> They tried that once. It didn't work. It made things worse.
[22:41] <Cowie`> Drugs aren't even bad.

[23:01] <bildramer> nor if it is anything more than bacteria
[23:01] <liq3> gear1: killing us is probably a waste of resources.
[23:01] <gear1> by killing i mean
[23:01] <gear1> teraforming our planet
[23:01] <gear1> to harvest it for resources
[23:01] <liq3> Well I guess they might infect us with some horrile virus that makes us all die, then harvest our planet...
[23:01] <bildramer> already done
[23:01] <bildramer> :P
[23:01] <Wervyn> So in terms of significance, our planetary civilization is the largest one we know of. It's also the smallest one we know of.
[23:02] <blaster> Hey bildramer what was your last GCSE score
[23:02] <bildramer> Germany here
[23:02] <blaster> Oh wait, you dont do GSCEs
[23:02] <Wervyn> Thus, it's meaningless to make claims about how significant it is on a galactic scale. We have no point of comparison.
[23:02] <blaster> Whatever tests you do
[23:02] <bildramer> um...
[23:02] <liq3> Damn, Humans are the least significant sentient life in the known universe. :(

[23:04] <gear1> 3KILOGRAMS COMING RIGHT UP
[23:04] <liq3> lol school grades.
[23:04] <Wervyn> Isn't blaster like 14, too?
[23:04] <vede-learns> Grades in school are an extremely poor meter of a person's intelligence.
[23:04] <sppt> Wervyn, no blaster's 8
[23:04] <vede-learns> ^^
[23:04] <Wervyn> I'd believe it.
[23:04] <bildramer> what vede said
[23:05] <bildramer> really, I suck at poetry e.g.
[23:05] <sppt> when i was 14 i'd pick snot from my nose and still get like an 8
[23:05] <sppt> or higher
[23:05] <sppt> out of 10
[23:05] <Wervyn> Actually kids aren't usually intolerable little shits on IRC at 8, that usually starts happening at puberty.
[23:05] <bildramer> lel
[23:05] <bildramer> "omg luk @ me i can trol u"
[23:05] <sppt> Wervyn, kids at that age use irc?
[23:05] <sppt> wow.
[23:05] <Wervyn> Yes.
[23:06] <Wervyn> asiekierka was like my favorite 9-year-old Polish kid. Except he's 14 or so now.

[23:08] <Speljohan_> rofl
[23:08] <Wervyn> It happens.
[23:08] <vede-learns> blaster, I skipped two grades because I made high scores on tests for Algebra, English, Chemistry, and History.
[23:08] <blaster> What is an AP calculus test
[23:08] <Speljohan_> you failed a bit there bildramer
[23:08] <gear1> i got a 5 on my BC
[23:08] <Speljohan_> lold
[23:08] <bildramer> I skipped 1 grade
[23:08] <Speljohan_> <blaster> What is an AP calculus test

[23:09] <gear1> ye.
[23:09] <vede-learns> blaster, but as I've been saying, being able to make good scores on tests and crap like that does not mean you're intelligent.
[23:09] <Speljohan_> ^
[23:09] <bildramer> ^
[23:09] <Speljohan_> anyone can study
[23:09] <vede-learns> ^ Quite.
[23:09] <Speljohan_> school isn't about grades anyway
[23:10] <bildramer> anyone can be less stupid than your average person
[23:10] <vede-learns> Speljohan_: depends on your idea of "about"
[23:10] <Speljohan_> vede-learns, as in, education isn't really to teach you a bunch of facts and information
[23:10] <Speljohan_> it's about "learning to learn" or whatever
[23:11] <vede-learns> Then yeah.
[23:11] <sppt> our government doesnt even really care about grades, as long as you have a sufficient mark (5.5+) on your exams it's fine
[23:11] <Speljohan_> and help you peek an interest in something you might want to work with in the future
[23:11] <blaster> 5.5 is not a mark here sppt

[23:11] <blaster> Its getting a D, C, B, A or A* here that matters
[23:11] <sppt> but to get <1 is impossible
[23:11] <vede-learns> Despite the fact that in a lot of places that isn't even taken into account, because people prefer to make judgments based on numbers on paper.
[23:12] <Speljohan_> rarely happens here in sweden vede-learns :P
[23:12] <Speljohan_> it's mostly about experience and interest
[23:12] <bildramer> Germany here
[23:12] <Speljohan_> of course, grades help
[23:12] <bildramer> 1-6
[23:12] <bildramer> 1 is best
[23:12] <Speljohan_> but they aren't the most important thing
[23:12] <bildramer> 5,6 are failing
[23:12] <vede-learns> I'd love to be in a scool where the focus is on actual understanding instead of grades. :(

[23:13] <vede-learns> You can generally make satisfactory grades on tests if all you do is remember buzzwords and such.
[23:13] <Wervyn> vede: Generally call that "college". Though it depends on the school then, too.
[23:14] <liq3> Tests are just memorization.

[23:15] <Speljohan_> wrong liq3
[23:15] <Speljohan_> private schools in sweden very much focus on that specifically
[23:15] <Wervyn> They do. But like I said, they're usually colleges. Or private schools, you might have luck there.
[23:15] <Speljohan_> like, they are still forced to have a grading system
[23:15] <Speljohan_> but it is usually not followed very strictly
[23:15] <liq3> Speljohan_: Technically speking it's entirely correct. I was expressing I didn't know that any exist, which is a statement about me and not the schoolss. :D

[23:24] <liq3> SC :BW IS NUTIN LIKE THAT>
[23:24] <blaster> Call the authorities that your parents are being... er... religionist
[23:24] <Speljohan_> Kodaichi is correct
[23:24] <blaster> Extreemists
[23:24] <Kodaichi> lol
[23:24] <bildramer> lol
[23:24] <Speljohan_> + microing 12 units per group?
[23:24] <Speljohan_> no thanks
[23:24] <liq3> Kodaichi is correct... IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOOBS.
[23:24] <Speljohan_> i want epic huge battles
[23:24] <liq3> Good players are lucky to build a BC or nuke.
[23:24] <Speljohan_> on randomized maps
[23:24] <Kodaichi> well anyways I play protoss
[23:24] <Kodaichi> I like the reavers and the carriers
[23:24] <blaster> Speljohan play Total war
[23:24] <liq3> And if they do it's usually not cost effective.
[23:24] <blaster> If you want truely huge battles
[23:24] <bildramer> did you guise see the SC2 beta zerg rush videos?
[23:24] <Speljohan_> i dislike total was blaster
[23:24] <Wervyn> Unless your parents are encouraging you to reject any and all religions. Just like them. Then it's okay, that's not enforcing your beliefs on your children at all.
[23:24] <liq3> Speljohan_: total annihilation. :D
[23:25] <Speljohan_> shit multiplayer

[23:25] <Kodaichi> BW is cool too. I don't really get the difference
[23:25] <liq3> AoE is some piece of shit that tried to be good and failed miserably. >:(
[23:25] <Kodaichi> I don't remember
[23:25] <vede-learns> Guys, guys, guys.
[23:25] <Speljohan_> lies liq3

[23:26] <liq3> ohhh i dunno about thaht.

[23:26] <liq3> some FPS games are pretty sweet.
[23:26] <Kodaichi> I can at least say I'm not a total noob at SC, I have won a couple games before
[23:26] <Speljohan_> what's wrong with rts vede-learns ?
[23:26] <Kodaichi> but it was lan :/
[23:26] <vede-learns> They're just not fun for me.
[23:26] <gear1> RTS GIVES YOU CANCER AND IS ADDICTIVE
[23:26] <bildramer> o
[23:26] <bildramer> D:
[23:26] <liq3> Kodaichi: Get and hold D on iCCup and THEN you can talk.
[23:27] <Speljohan_> gear1 is correct about addictive part
[23:27] <liq3> Kodaichi: need to hold it for at least 12 games.
[23:27] <bildramer> lol
[23:27] <Speljohan_> liq3 we even have a ladder bot in #rts
[23:27] <Speljohan_> !
[23:27] <blaster> Guys, how about a minecraft RTS
[23:27] <liq3> or get 1400+ plat it SC2
[23:27] <Speljohan_> i actually toyed with that idea already blaster
[23:27] <liq3> that counts too.
[23:27] <Speljohan_> and made a prototype
[23:27] <Kodaichi> umm please you're making me feel like an outcast. :/
[23:27] <blaster> With creeper suicide bombers, skelly archers, and zombie melee troops
[23:27] <blaster> It would actualy function realy well
[23:27] <Kodaichi> I am not a pro gamer

[23:28] <liq3> Playing SC2 without someone to chat to about shit is bad.
[23:28] <blaster> This Minecraft RTS could work realy well
[23:28] <Kodaichi> I bet you I can have way more fun than you playing SC >:)

[23:32] <Kodaichi> lol
[23:33] <vede-learns> blaster, you're stupid, and that idea sucks.
[23:33] <Kodaichi> the bots in #tly were just arguing about what their reply rates should be
[23:33] <blaster> How does that idea suck
[23:33] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.24.121) has left #minecraft
[23:33] <blaster> A realistic mode would make the game more chalenging
[23:34] <Kodaichi> and then we need Realism Vs
[23:34] <vede-learns> That's essentially the standard "needing to eat and drink" suggestion which has been shot down every single time the last hundred or so people suggested it, plus a ridiculous item-weights system.
[23:34] <blaster> Hmm about that minecraft RTS
[23:35] <blaster> Killing enemies causes them to drop the loot they normaly would
[23:35] <Kodaichi> oh now
[23:35] <Kodaichi> The only thing I want to make it more realistic
[23:35] <Kodaichi> is for building to take time
[23:35] <blaster> And you can use this to equip your mob 'villagers' with bombs and arrows ect...
[23:35] <Kodaichi> because the instant placement/forever breakdown is stupid
[23:35] <blaster> To create additional troop types
[23:35] <vede-learns> Kodaichi, that would make the game *really* tedious, don't you think?
[23:36] <Kodaichi> not VERY long,
[23:36] <blaster> The constuction time is simulated in the digging time
[23:36] <Kodaichi> the longest stuff would be like 2 seconds, tops
[23:36] <Kodaichi> dirt would be instant
[23:36] <blaster> Digging time acts as constuction time
[23:36] <Kodaichi> rock would be half a second or something maybe
[23:36] <blaster> You cannot build instantly because you need to gather materials
[23:36] <gear1> do you mean for placing it?
[23:37] <Kodaichi> yeah
[23:37] <gear1> like.. constructing a building?
[23:37] <Kodaichi> literally that
[23:37] <gear1> i dont know about you but it still takes me some time to build a building
[23:37] <Kodaichi> yeah. true
[23:37] <gear1> gotta climb all up on shit, make scafolding sometimes
[23:37] <Kodaichi> its true but, maybe you could still place multiple blocks at once
[23:38] <Kodaichi> drag out a shape on yourr screen, etc
[23:38] <Kodaichi> 2 mouse axis + mouse wheel for full 3D control
[23:38] <vede-learns> Building a wall with a build delay could potentially make a decently-sized wall take a very long time (multiple days) to build, and I don't think that spending an entire game-day watching blocks be constructed would enhance the experience at all.
[23:38] <vede-learns> Also I gotta go, so brb in about an hour, homeys.

[23:49] <blaster> 4. I made a 2d topdown minecraft in it
[23:49] <bildramer> not really hard
[23:49] <bildramer> someone made Iji in it

[23:52] <DDRJake> I'm alright with problems but when it comes to axioms and definitions I fall appart
[23:52] <bildramer> one goes 0.5cm to the right
[23:52] <blaster> 3 vectors is 3d
[23:52] <bildramer> one goes 0.5cm to the bottom
[23:52] <blaster> Apparently
[23:52] <bildramer> X and Y
[23:53] <bildramer> you could use one that goes -0.5cm to the left and -1cm to the top and 1cm to the right and 2.5cm to the bottom
