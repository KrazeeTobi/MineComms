[0:46] <Plinky|Sleep> I love how he continued to leak it.
[0:46] <Plinky|Sleep> He is awesome
[0:46] <Nerdyy> SGS
[0:46] <Nerdyy> GSG
[0:46] <Nerdyy> g = gunpowder
[0:46] <Flamester> thanks
[0:47] <Nerdyy> S = sand
[0:47] <Nerdyy> NP
[0:47] <Flamester> thoughy it was gravel
[0:47] <Mos> well, I guess leaking the MP had the result of showing that the server is stable :V
[0:47] <Mos> good work leakers
[0:47] <Nerdyy> ^
[0:47] <Mine_Builder> Hey does anyone know how SMP is gonna work regarding death?
[0:47] <Zaneo> It crashes every 20 lol
[0:47] <Azure> you respawn
[0:47] <Ronjoe> it doesnt work well
[0:47] <Zaneo> if even at that
[0:47] <Link2006> Same as Mos
[0:47] <Azure> and lose all your items
[0:47] <Mine_Builder> Imediatly?
[0:47] <Azure> except it doesn't work yet :D
[0:47] <Azure> yea
[0:47] <Mine_Builder> :
[0:47] <Mine_Builder> :/
[0:47] <Nerdyy> Just like survival pretty much
[0:47] <Azure> you press respawn
[0:47] <Ronjoe> respawn currently sets you in the same place as you died
[0:47] <asiekierka> Someone ask Notch "Who's Thomas?"
[0:47] <Azure> :P
[0:48] <Mos> I'm Thomas.
[0:48] <funnyguy3D> are the players trying to join smp died down a little?
[0:48] <Zaneo> type /home when you get in
[0:48] <Nerdyy> Asie thomas is a sheep
[0:48] <Mine_Builder> I see persistant trolls (or raiders) having fun with this
[0:48] <Nerdyy> There is a thread
[0:48] <Azure> not at all funnyguy3D
[0:48] <Mos> funnyguy3D: 3-5 connections a second
[0:48] <Nerdyy> I can find it for you
[0:48] <Azure> lol
[0:48] <bearz> wonder how many players are there on the server right now?
[0:48] <Azure> 20
[0:48] * Alram (Marla@fabe.xs4all.nl) has joined #minecraft
[0:48] <Zaneo> 20
[0:48] <Azure> lol
[0:48] <Mos> and they all crash in like 5 seconds
[0:48] <Mine_Builder> What server?
[0:48] <Plinky|Sleep> Who is on?
[0:48] <Mos> it was more stable before it got leaked so i'm guessing too many players kills clients
[0:48] <Nerdyy> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=18455
[0:48] <Nerdyy> Thomas in that link
[0:48] <Azure> multiplayer survival server

[0:54] <bearz> nerdyy start fighting with other people >:D kill em
[0:54] <Mystery_Guy> Try 10x10 size map in Dwarf fortress with 20 cats :D
[0:54] <GreenHoopla> Also, would anyone be kind and let me know when the next server crash happens.
[0:54] <Nerdyy> OO green
[0:54] <Nerdyy> When notch was on my stream he did say this
[0:55] <Mine_Builder> Have you guys noticed how it takes waaay too long to get gunpower?
[0:55] <Nerdyy> "If you play on a non-inf map you can have a larger player count"
[0:55] <Nerdyy> So
[0:55] <Azure> tnt is OP
[0:55] <Azure> so gunpower should be scarce
[0:55] <GreenHoopla> I don't mind that nerdyy
[0:55] <Nerdyy> if the map is big but not inf then more players
[0:55] <GreenHoopla> I got 4 extra gigs of ram just for this
[0:55] <bearz> why anybody hasn't spawned like 5000 tnt's yet?
[0:55] <GreenHoopla> so I have 9 gigs of ram now :)
[0:55] <Zaneo> notvh did

[0:56] <GreenHoopla> I am going to be running the best server ever (probably not)
[0:56] <Nerdyy> Lol
[0:56] <Nerdyy> I will join if it is the best
[0:56] <Mine_Builder> I've been wanting to add traps to my alpha map but I haven't played minecraft in about two months atleast so I don't know a nice way to go about that.

[1:32] <Willox> m nImnot even trying
[1:32] <Deages> hm
[1:32] <Deages> assuming this rate keeps up
[1:32] <Drake|Resting> I'm glad I got a few hours when I did O.o
[1:32] <Deages> I might end up making my server private, ish
[1:32] <Phil> i bet once notch has multi running and then moves back to adding pure content, his sales will double
[1:32] <Flot> You should try. That's how I got in and found out it was unfinished and not worth trying for.
[1:32] <Deages> I'd rather a close community of 20-30 regulars than 5 john does every day
[1:33] <GreenHoopla> How will the updating on public servers work?
[1:33] <Deages> I'm assuming he'd release updates for both
[1:33] <Phil> yes
[1:33] <GreenHoopla> Having to download updates?
[1:33] <Deages> what do you mean?
[1:33] <GreenHoopla> Or real time updates like in alpha at the moment
[1:33] <Drake|Resting> also, the RAM useage impresses me
[1:33] <Phil> once smp is done content should release for it normally
[1:33] <GreenHoopla> Like with the old creative

[1:34] <Drake|Resting> Which is a /good/ thing
[1:34] <RavenBurga> Oops wrong channel

[1:34] <Phil> i dont like thise new /slash. technique you're all using
[1:34] <Phil> kinda /lame/
[1:34] <Drake|Resting> any server should be fine.
[1:35] <Willox> I saw that coming
[1:35] <Drake|Resting> Would you rather me use this?
[1:35] <Phil> sdure
[1:35] <Mithril> Phil: I dont think so , this game is too slow for LAN
[1:35] <Phil> no way mithril

[1:35] <Phil> to play
[1:35] <Drake|Resting> * Sometimes an entire chunk fails to get added to the client, making a huge hole in the world. Trying to jump down it leads to the server resetting your position, but since that?s still over the hole, you start falling again, ever faster. It?s pretty disturbing.

[1:58] <polan> let's keeping loging in so we might lag out people in ^^
[1:58] <Deages> TrueWolves|AwayForAFewDays: what about whether child prostitution is acceptable?
[1:58] <Deages> what about THEN

[1:58] <Flot> @ looks like at.
[1:58] <Plinky|Sleep> Flot, Notch has taken it and used it to help his development.
[1:58] <Plinky|Sleep> :P
[1:58] <GreenHoopla> Not this @.
[1:58] <Stenlay> mnjiman, i don't care if i can't play. it just that we can't trust tha someone won't leak the code..
[1:58] <Fiskie> @ looks like @
[1:59] <Deages> @ looks like a reverse (at)
[1:59] <TrueWolves|AwayForAFewDays> almost everything has a good or bad side, a lot of things just have more of one then another.
[1:59] <GreenHoopla> @ looks like a d with a curvy top nowadays.
[1:59] <Flot> And while we're at it, % looks like %!
[1:59] <polan> Notch could make password per slot :)
[1:59] <Deages> so what's a good side of child prostitution then true?
[1:59] <GreenHoopla> And the snozzberries tast like snozzberries!
[1:59] <polan> that way no leaks would be possible..
[1:59] <Deages> yes it would
[1:59] <TrueWolves|AwayForAFewDays> The only one I can think of is more freedom, which is one that not everyone will agree on for other reasons.
[1:59] <Deages> people would just leak each slot
[1:59] <wareya> Make the passwodr a hash based on username!

[2:51] <Traviskolber> Flot, ROFL
[2:52] <xRDVx> sigh..
[2:52] <Roadcrosser> And he said "Darn! Well they'll break up right?"
[2:52] <Quatroking> lol
[2:52] <Roadcrosser> So I said "Well he already moved in with her"
[2:52] <Traviskolber> Roadcrosser, your friend is stupid.
[2:52] <Traviskolber> Slap him for me.
[2:52] <Roadcrosser> He said "Gay!"
[2:52] <Quatroking> and then you said "they're getting married later this year"
[2:52] <xRDVx> This is worse <.<
[2:52] <Roadcrosser> That was a few weeks ago
[2:52] <Traviskolber> He must be gay if he thinks moving in with a girl is gay -.-
[2:52] <asiekierka> ok
[2:52] <Roadcrosser> and nu Quatty
[2:52] <asiekierka> time to stop playing SMP
[2:52] <asiekierka> and get a life
[2:52] <Traviskolber> Asiekierka, O.o
[2:53] <technological> damn full server
[2:53] <GreenHoopla> Hey Ez, i've been wondering something. Has Notch bought anything out of the ordinary or extra fancy with his new income?
[2:53] <Traviskolber> TECHNO,
[2:53] <polan> a sierkierka dobi?a kotka..
[2:53] <Traviskolber> READ FOR ONCE
[2:53] <technological> i know
[2:53] <Traviskolber> You'll never get in.
[2:53] <Traviskolber> Stop trying.
[2:53] <polan> he got house
[2:53] <Shadaez> He bought a bike
[2:53] <Traviskolber> If you magically get n, it isn't worth it.
[2:53] <Traviskolber> Oh, and he doesn't actually get much money.
[2:53] <Shadaez> probably a fancy bike
[2:53] <Compo> can someone please join my livestream I need to see if it's working properly, (I'm just playing infdev atm)
[2:53] <Traviskolber> 60% of all income he doesn't receive.
[2:53] <Compo> http://www.ustream.tv/broadcaster/4541051
[2:53] <Traviskolber> You people know that, right?
[2:53] <Flot> Yup. If you wanna get it, you wanna get in while the Western world is asleep. Those silly Asians don't care about minecraft!
[2:53] <Shadaez> Traviskolber LOL he doesn't get much money
[2:54] <GreenHoopla> I know he doesnt get much, Travis. But that doesn't mean he doesn't get any.
[2:54] <polan> 60%? :o how do you know ;)
[2:54] <polan> but still
[2:54] <xRDVx> lol
[2:54] <Traviskolber> 50% Swedish tax.
[2:54] <polan> 40% of daily = 2k euro.
[2:54] <Traviskolber> 10% Paypal tax.
[2:54] <polan> xP
[2:54] <Shadaez> he gets paid 75 euro an hour, every hour of the day, after taxes
[2:54] <polan> true, it's not alot. ;p
[2:54] <Traviskolber> Shadaez, he doesn't get paid.
[2:54] <Shadaez> he earns, then
[2:54] <Flot> He gets the bread.
[2:54] <Traviskolber> He receives money depending on how many purchases he gets.
[2:54] <polan> and he get 400-500 per day
[2:54] <polan> 10e each
[2:54] <Traviskolber> 35,000 so far, each being $13, calculate that, then reduce 60%.

[2:55] <Traviskolber> And boom, you have his approximate income since the beginning of this project.
[2:55] <Shadaez> after doing the math, about 500 purchases per day = 75 euro an hour after taxes
[2:55] <Flot> Why does everyone here have a finance fetish.
[2:55] <GreenHoopla> Not counting his job before and ez's job ;P
[2:55] <Traviskolber> Then, you need to calculate his needs.
[2:55] <GreenHoopla> He needs lots of coffee

[2:56] <JabJAbJab> Don't mind if i share a thought on how i think the system in the server for SMP should work?
[2:56] <JabJAbJab> :P

[2:56] <Stenlay> Do anyone wanna play garry's mod with me?
[2:56] <Traviskolber> No.
[2:56] <JabJAbJab> bunch of knobs :)
[2:56] <Traviskolber> I'm talking about how much money he has for spare stuff.
[2:57] <Shadaez> sigh
[2:57] <Shadaez> which is a TON
[2:57] <Traviskolber> Not really =/
[2:57] <Traviskolber> Maybe for some people, yea.
[2:57] <Shadaez> how much do you make?
[2:57] <polan> stenlay, what server?
[2:57] <Traviskolber> Uh, nothing?
[2:57] <Traviskolber> I'm not 18 you know -.-
[2:57] <polan> so?
[2:57] <Shadaez> oaky, 75 euro is a lot of money an hour
[2:57] <Pelum> underage b&
[2:57] <polan> you can earn already :)
[2:57] <Pelum> get out now
[2:58] <Stenlay> loMine, it has Minecraft Blocks
[2:58] <Stenlay> Polan
[2:58] <Traviskolber> Shadaez, but 75 euro an hour is not his set income *Facepalm*
[2:58] <GreenHoopla> On average it is
[2:58] <Traviskolber> That is an average, if anything.
[2:58] <Shadaez> your point?
[2:58] <Flot> Yeah. The mean does not mean that he LITERALLY earns that much an hour.
[2:58] <Traviskolber> So say on average, instead of saying "Well, he earns 75 euro an hour".
[2:58] <Plinky> He can earn more or less.
[2:58] <Plinky> :P
[2:58] <Traviskolber> Of course.
[2:58] <Traviskolber> Depending on purchases.
[2:58] <lifeless> Or how about this
[2:59] <lifeless> he earns money
[2:59] <polan> and much mo
[2:59] <Shadaez> I don't see where you're going
[2:59] <Traviskolber> Some days are more active, some are less.
[2:59] <lifeless> period
[2:59] <polan> more
[2:59] <lifeless> lol
[2:59] <Traviskolber> Also depends on time of year.
[2:59] <polan> remember that his sale rate is growing
[2:59] <Shadaez> purchases per day have only increased
[2:59] <Flot> It doesn't take into account the Standard Deviation, and the... oh damn, who am I kidding. I haven't taken statistics in years.
[2:59] <Traviskolber> Polan, true that.
[2:59] <Shadaez> the game's not even released, and is at half price
[2:59] <polan> ya..
[2:59] <Traviskolber> True, true.
[2:59] <polan> key to success is to have nice idea for game ^^
[2:59] <Kodaichi> oh man
[2:59] <Traviskolber> Polan, yup.
[2:59] <Kodaichi> you know what is a really scary sight?
[3:00] <Flot> A dead guy?
[3:00] <Traviskolber> That is why all the major series profit so much.
[3:00] <Kodaichi> lighting up a torch and staring at a ceiling of sand.
[3:00] <Traviskolber> This may join them up there in terms of profit, and the amazing part is that it is all by one guy.
[3:00] <Shadaez> not really, polan, look at avatar
[3:00] <polan> major series :P? well most modern game are failish x/ and they sell only thx to graphic..
[3:00] <Kodaichi> my god the ceiling is huge and almost all sand T_T
[3:00] <Shadaez> if you put enough money into anything it's most likely going to succeed
[3:00] <Shadaez> no matter how bad it is
[3:00] <Traviskolber> Not really.
[3:00] <polan> but success for indie programmer :)
[3:00] <Traviskolber> I don't care for graphics.
[3:00] <Traviskolber> Why do you think I'm playing Minecraft? -.-
[3:00] <polan> me too but there are billions of player that care.
[3:00] <Traviskolber> I play all the major 'three'.
[3:00] <Traviskolber> GoW, Halo, and CoD>
[3:01] <GreenHoopla> I enjoy graphics, but meh
[3:01] <Pelum> lol Halo
[3:01] <Pelum> get out
[3:01] <Traviskolber> CoD a lot less, but that isn't the points.
[3:01] <Pelum> now
[3:01] <Pelum> leave
[3:01] <Shadaez> lol major three
[3:01] <Traviskolber> Pelum, stfu.
[3:01] <Shadaez> what is this
[3:01] <Pelum> bwahahahahhahahahhahahahhaha Halo
[3:01] <GreenHoopla> My top games right now are Minecraft, Read Dead Redemption, Windows Flight Simulator X, and the Sims 3
[3:01] <polan> I have friend who can run source on lowest and czero on highest and he play czero.. why? because it say "high details" in options xP
[3:01] <Traviskolber> You are making yourself look bad.
[3:01] <Shadaez> halo > cod lets be srs
[3:01] <GreenHoopla> I like a wide taste in games :P
[3:01] <Traviskolber> Shadaez, I agree.
[3:01] <Traviskolber> But that isn't the point.
[3:01] <Pelum> original CoD was better then all 3 of those games combined
[3:01] <Flot> I didn't like the original.
[3:01] <Traviskolber> Just because I play the major games, doesn't mean I like them ONLY because of graphics.
[3:01] <polan> wurm online > everything expect minecraft.
[3:02] <Shadaez> oh man i miss being banned from here a little
[3:02] <Traviskolber> I can't care for graphics, otherwise I wouldn't be here.
[3:02] <GreenHoopla> Wurm online was fun to me for a few months
[3:02] <GreenHoopla> but I succumbed to the tedium
[3:02] <Shadaez> all i do is get frustrated
[3:02] <polan> I played it for 4,5 year :
[3:02] <Traviskolber> Everyone here doesn't care for graphics.
[3:02] <GreenHoopla> I do.
[3:02] <Traviskolber> Otherwise they'd be playing something like Crysis on a supercomputer.
[3:02] <GreenHoopla> Depends on the game though.
[3:02] <polan> sandbox games are best..
[3:02] <polan> but it's annyoing how they call game like gta sandbox >..>
[3:02] <Traviskolber> Imo, RTS's are the best.
[3:02] <polan> while it isn't.
[3:02] <Pelum> im a gfx designer by profession =/
[3:02] <Traviskolber> All about opinion, though.
[3:03] <GreenHoopla> This games graphics support it's purpose. As does Sims 3, as does Windows Flight Simulator X
[3:03] <Pelum> and yes RTS's are win
[3:03] <polan> not all..
[3:03] <Traviskolber> But maybe I'm biased.
[3:03] <Traviskolber> Because I like thinking and planning.
[3:03] <GreenHoopla> I do not enjoy RTSs at all.
[3:03] <Flot> I have designed several graphics in my day. Why just the other day I designed no less than five graphics.
[3:03] <polan> rts like cossacks, stronghold, warcraft, rome total war are great. but some like new total wars.. bleh.
[3:03] <Traviskolber> I love the new total wars.
[3:04] <Traviskolber> I'm even doing a LP of Napoleon.
[3:04] <polan> I prefer good old rome :)
[3:04] <Pelum> empire earth 1 was win, EE2 and EE3 are bad
[3:04] <Flot> Rome is best!
[3:04] <Flot> Good work polan.
[3:04] <polan> better morale system, more tactic..

[3:12] <sorre> but it's hard to know what to believe on a place like /v/
[3:13] <Quatroking> polan: yep
[3:13] <sorre> i mean, people have been posting about SMP invites in minecraft general threads for like a week
[3:13] <Quatroking> lmao
[3:13] <polan> btw In the last 24 hours 572 people bought the game. new record?
[3:13] <Quatroking> this is why I love the 7zip format
[3:13] <Traviskolber> Polan, no one cares about purchases.
[3:13] <Traviskolber> Except Notch XD
[3:13] <Quatroking> I just downloaded those leaked afghan documents
[3:13] <Quatroking> the 7zip was 74MB
[3:13] * sorre reads the blog
[3:13] <Quatroking> unpacked, its over 3 gigs
[3:13] <Faegbeard> enjoy your FBI enquiry
[3:14] <sorre> 20 to 24 people per GB>
[3:14] <Traviskolber> I just got five e-mails from the forums O_O
[3:14] <sorre> ?*
[3:14] <polan> time for some gmod :) bye.
[3:14] <Quatroking> sorre: yes
[3:14] <sorre> that's nothing
[3:14] * polan (polan92pl@exodus-109.core.ynet.pl) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[3:14] <Traviskolber> Sorre, 20-24 people per 1 GB of ram.
[3:14] <Compo> bye
[3:14] <Faegbeard> I think that's only if they're all generating new land too.
[3:14] <sorre> god damn, notch
[3:14] <sorre> nice work
[3:14] <Traviskolber> I have no idea how much RAM I have.
[3:14] <Traviskolber> Probably a bit.
[3:14] <Quatroking> get a simple 8GB server and wooo
[3:14] <sorre> i has 6GB ram personally
[3:14] <sorre> and, yeah, a dedicated server would have more
[3:14] <Traviskolber> I bet those people with super computers will have servers with 500+ people on them.
[3:14] <Faegbeard> If someone makes a server with 20+GB of ram
[3:14] <Faegbeard> goddamn
[3:15] <Traviskolber> Guys.
[3:15] <Traviskolber> Guys, listen.

[3:15] <Traviskolber> Imagine the madness with a 500+ people SMP server.
[3:15] <Traviskolber> O_O
[3:15] <sorre> also, like i said before, someone is eventually going to try to network two servers together
[3:15] <sorre> and use them both to power the same gameworld
[3:15] <Faegbeard> greifing
[3:15] <Faegbeard> greifing everywher
[3:15] <Traviskolber> And it'll be REAL.
[3:15] <Plinky> Sorre, I also said that :P
[3:15] <Traviskolber> It isn't a dream anymore.
[3:15] <Traviskolber> It is REAL.
[3:15] <Traviskolber> Those rich ass people with supercomputers will be able to host servers with OVER9000 people!!!
[3:15] <Mattress> A persistant world of cubes
[3:16] <Faegbeard> good thing I have a nigh impenetrable base idea.

[3:16] <Faegbeard> 't
[3:17] <Traviskolber> Bullshit.
[3:17] <Faegbeard> get though 20 cubes
[3:17] <Faegbeard> of lava

[3:17] <sorre> what if gandalf is guaring the bridge?
[3:17] <Traviskolber> Faegbeard, they come in the millions :P
[3:17] <Faegbeard> its just very difficut

[3:18] <Bodie> i hope one day i get a friend called Thomas
[3:18] <Traviskolber> Because it is OVER 9000 years old.
[3:18] <Faegbeard> then you just wait for him to fall of
[3:18] <Faegbeard> then build a new one
[3:18] <Plinky> Quatroking: With the whole custom servers, people will cluster once they start making custom servers. y/n?
[3:18] <Bodie> because i can now instinctively type that name in a few milliseconds
[3:18] <Phil> what if its solid lava dark block things?
[3:18] <Phil> thats not tnt-able i bet
[3:18] <Traviskolber> I hope Notch NEVER lets people create private servers.
[3:18] <Traviskolber> Imagine how lonely it'll be for those who aren't social with over 9000 friends.
[3:18] <Faegbeard> ye
[3:18] <Mattress> Adminium
[3:18] <Traviskolber> -.-
[3:18] <Phil> are you retared?
[3:18] <Phil> im hosting private
[3:18] <Quatroking> For example two servers each sharing 50% of the chunks, workload etc.
[3:18] <Traviskolber> GTFO.
[3:18] <Phil> no way I want milluions of trolls
[3:19] <Phil> in my own server
[3:19] <Phil> only my buddies
[3:19] <Mattress> Like folding@home but a giant minecraft world
[3:19] <Faegbeard> thsounds boring
[3:19] <Faegbeard> wheres the DANGER
[3:19] <Faegbeard> wheres the EXCITEMENT
[3:19] <Plinky> Traviskolber: He is going to release smp server software with option of a private server.
[3:19] <Phil> trolls arent fun danger
[3:19] <Traviskolber> FUCK
[3:19] <Faegbeard> they certainly are
[3:19] <Phil> lol
[3:19] <Traviskolber> -.-
[3:19] <Traviskolber> I quit.

[3:19] <Traviskolber> Screw this.
[3:19] <Traviskolber> Back to SSP.
[3:19] <Quatroking> folding@home is just an excuse for the universities to create a legal botnet
[3:19] <Phil> why do you carte?
[3:19] <Quatroking> duh
[3:19] <Traviskolber> All a TERRIBE idea.
[3:19] <Phil> there will be pulic
[3:19] <Shadaez> Quatroking i'm pretty sure it will be bandwidth bottlenecked more than anything else, so that wuoldn't help
[3:19] <Plinky> Quatroking: Shall be good fun once that is developed.
[3:19] <Traviskolber> And who will play it when everyone is in giant projects?
[3:19] <Traviskolber> <_<
[3:20] <Phil> hahah
[3:20] <Faegbeard> i will destroy their projects
[3:20] <Mattress> Was that guy still working on the Imperial City/

[3:22] <Smoke> oh so that last night was like the first proper multiplayer test?
[3:22] <Phil> fuck that
[3:22] <Phil> pillaring is bvest

[3:22] <Faegbeard> or a floating fortress
[3:23] <Phil> k...
[3:23] <Faegbeard> if some can just 1x1 up to it

[3:23] <Phil> well im not lteting trolls in
[3:23] <Phil> only my personal friends
[3:23] <Phil> so i dont have to worry
[3:23] <Faegbeard> :/

[3:25] <Traviskolber> Mattress, no need to point out the obvious.
[3:25] <Faegbeard> Was I being retarded and trying to reverse reverse troll plot lynch everyone?
[3:25] <Zuriki> Notch applied "fixes"
[3:25] <Zuriki> Which makes the server slower to respond
[3:25] <Traviskolber> No he hasn't?
[3:25] <Traviskolber> Why would he?
[3:26] <Traviskolber> Why apply fixes to a testing server that is overloaded with crap?

[3:26] <Bodie> i'm in the SMP server
[3:26] <Bodie> but i keep falling
[3:26] <Bodie> nothings happening

[3:26] <Traviskolber> There is no point in staying.
[3:26] <Zuriki> He said "RESTARTING TO APPLY FIXES"

[3:27] <Faegbeard> Goddamn.
[3:27] <Plinky> I think the major problem if the connections.

[3:30] <Traviskolber> 1 GB of RAM is 20-24 players :)
[3:30] <lifeless> holy fuck
[3:30] <Traviskolber> So 24x8.
[3:30] <Shadaez> RAM isn't the only thing you need
[3:30] <Plinky> Traviskolber: It allowed Notch to stress test though
[3:30] <lifeless> 192
[3:30] <TotempaaltJ> That'd be 192 players.
[3:30] <TotempaaltJ> Awesome.
[3:30] <Traviskolber> Yup.

[3:30] <Traviskolber> That have like 20+ RAM.

[3:31] <Traviskolber> It is only going to get worse as morning approaches.
[3:31] <Quatroking> Snowman, 4 login requests a sec
[3:32] <Traviskolber> Snowman, when /v/ gets a grip on something, they beat it until nothing is left.
[3:32] <Snowman> Oh, great
[3:32] <Snowman> Severe stress testing
[3:32] <Traviskolber> And it isn't morning yet.
[3:32] <Plinky> I think it is helping Notch though.
[3:32] <Snowman> It's 12:32 where Notch lives
[3:32] <TotempaaltJ> Traviskolber: You know, like, timezones?
[3:32] <Quatroking> Yeah, I don't really expect any actual testing to happen anymore

[3:32] <Traviskolber> Your point is invalid because it is unrelated.
[3:32] <Kodaichi> I know it's tempting for notch to do, but if adventure mode is purely random-generated dungeons I will be very disappointed

[3:34] <Smoke> that thing was spammed around so much.

[3:35] <Plinky> It is unstable because of the connections right now :P

[3:35] <Traviskolber> Unstable is an underestimation.
[3:35] <Traviskolber> Caturday?
[3:35] <Traviskolber> Really?
[3:35] <Plinky> Unstable isn't an underestimation.

[3:36] <Snowman> Is the server still running the same map?
[3:36] <lifeless> i mean with tonnes of connections

[3:44] <lifeless> but this post is 2hrs old
[3:44] <Traviskolber> Np, Ez.
[3:44] <Traviskolber> :)
[3:44] <Traviskolber> I know I reported him a bit too much XD
[3:44] <ez> major annoyance :P
[3:44] <ez> yeh, well, hehe
[3:44] <Madtoaster> Order of Tales is the best webcomic EVER
[3:44] <ChJees> Do a Minecraft channel for programming utilities exist?
[3:44] <Traviskolber> "Thanks for sharing!!"
[3:44] <Traviskolber> XD
[3:44] <ColdFusion> I just spoofed some packages from minecraft. And now i see why the server uses so much bandwich
[3:44] <ColdFusion> http://filesmelt.com/dl/NotchNetworking.PNG
[3:44] <ez> :P
[3:44] <Traviskolber> It was funny.. until I saw it was all 40 of his posts x.x
[3:44] <ez> yeh....
[3:45] <Smoke> So is the alpha like HUGELY different from classic by this point
[3:45] <ez> same
[3:45] <Traviskolber> Then I was like "That's it, I'm callin' ze mods".
[3:45] <Epitaph64> One thing I'd like to see in minecraft is cattails
[3:45] <RavenBurga> Anyone know if MC willsupport lua?
[3:45] <Madtoaster> I dont think so.
[3:45] <BipolarWafflez> lol lua
[3:45] <lifeless> pretty uch smoke
[3:45] <Traviskolber> I've actually been doing a lot of reporting. Mostly asking for moves.
[3:45] <lifeless> much*
[3:45] <RavenBurga> Lol
[3:45] <ez> I played around a bit with the simple hello world java code to try to learn, but haven't touched it since, that was err, two years ago?
[3:45] <Traviskolber> SMoke, yes, it is.
[3:45] <ez> err no
[3:45] <ChJees> Smoke, it is like day and night
[3:45] <Epitaph64> If he does mods I bet it will be in java
[3:45] <ez> one year ago maybe
[3:45] <Madtoaster> I cant stand programming.
[3:45] <ez> it was fun
[3:45] <ez> but I'm old lol
[3:45] <Madtoaster> I stare at it and dont understand anything.
[3:46] <ez> and it takes time
[3:46] <BipolarWafflez> My brain hurts when learning programming related things
[3:46] <lifeless> lol i tried to learn LUA the other day
[3:46] <ChJees> lol
[3:46] <Traviskolber> Notch says otherwise x.x
[3:46] <Smoke> I hate lua , lua can go take a jump
[3:46] <lifeless> made a gamemode for gmod
[3:46] <lifeless> and it failed
[3:46] <Epitaph64> Java is my language of choice
[3:46] <Madtoaster> It would help if there was a tutorial/guide that DOESNT INVOLVE KNOWING ANYTHING IN THE FIRST PLACE
[3:46] <Zaneo> programming ends in a lot of knowing your doing it wrong, but being too lazy to fix it
[3:46] <Traviskolber> One year.
[3:46] <RavenBurga> Ez your like me I tried learning c++ java HTML batch and lua but it's just boring
[3:46] <Traviskolber> 35,000 purchases.
[3:46] <ChJees> Programming is quite fun, if you have a fun project
[3:46] <Traviskolber> Built from the ground up.
[3:46] <lifeless> i just prefer mapping
[3:46] <ColdFusion> Nothing wrong with lua its flexable
[3:46] <Madtoaster> Look at Cortex Command.
[3:46] <Zaneo> see Gmod
[3:46] <Madtoaster> Lua, and full of awesome mods.
[3:46] <RavenBurga> Yeah actually I AM doing lua now
[3:46] <ez> Traviskolber, more like 36301 purchases
[3:46] <Smoke> I like wiremod in gmod, got really into that at one point
[3:46] <Traviskolber> Close enough :P
[3:47] <ez> hehe
[3:47] <Madtoaster> I cant even understand Wiremod.
[3:47] <Traviskolber> You get the point, thuogh.
[3:47] <lifeless> i understand the basics
[3:47] <Traviskolber> *Though.
[3:47] <Madtoaster> I can make buttons.
[3:47] <RavenBurga> Wire is simple
[3:47] <lifeless> but E2 im like... wha
[3:47] <Smoke> I made a delorian that transports when you hit 88 MPh
[3:47] <Smoke> lol
[3:47] <RavenBurga> For 14+
[3:47] <Madtoaster> Yeah, I know the simple bits.

[3:47] <Epitaph64> Haha, smoke, you were the one behind that?
[3:47] <Madtoaster> Learning?
[3:48] <Epitaph64> Think I saw a video on Digg of that
[3:48] <RavenBurga> Do you know how to make a door that opens if you push 1 of 2 buttons and closes after a few seconds?
[3:48] <Shadaez> Phil I'm having a hard time moving from console applications to graphic stuffs, and I'm still confused on a few concepts.
[3:48] <Shadaez> It's getting hard to get by alone
[3:48] <RavenBurga> Without e2?
[3:48] <Phil> shadez: what language?
[3:48] <Shadaez> anything
[3:48] <Shadaez> C# or java preferable
[3:48] <Madtoaster> Ima gonna try writing my own story.
[3:48] <Shadaez> y
[3:48] <Madtoaster> With Illustrations.
[3:49] <Epitaph64> ah yeah, I was in your position Shadaez, and I would just keep trying new languages until one clicks
[3:49] <Madtoaster> Bad illustrations.
[3:49] <Epitaph64> that is, if you have a serious desire to program
[3:49] <Phil> oh c#
[3:49] <Phil> good
[3:49] <Shadaez> Epitaph64 I do.
[3:49] <Traviskolber> Zaneo, Ez was busy locking a thread.
[3:49] <Epitaph64> I tried at least 10+ languages before I found Java and actually made something graphical :P
[3:49] <Traviskolber> Ask him again.
[3:49] <Zaneo> her*
[3:49] <Phil> you should make xbox games
[3:49] <Phil> make scrila
[3:49] <Shadaez> I made an android application

[3:49] <Traviskolber> Didn't know.
[3:49] <Zaneo> heh
[3:50] <Epitaph64> now that I'm in college getting a programming degree though, I pretty much have to know about 6 languages before I graduate haha
[3:50] <Madtoaster> Anyone wanna hear the premise to my story?
[3:50] <Shadaez> it uses intents to scan a barcode with zxing's barcode scanner, then sends you to my website search?=(Barcode)
[3:50] <Bomb_Spammer> Yes, but only so I can mock it
[3:50] <Madtoaster> Ok.
[3:50] <Epitaph64> Shadaez, have you tried Slick?
[3:50] <ColdFusion> Timer. Set timer A to reset and A to close door. Then make a button that start the timer and opends the door
[3:50] <Shadaez> Epitaph64 no
[3:50] <Madtoaster> There once was a GREAT HERO called BOMB_SPAMMER

[3:54] <Phil> k cool*
[3:55] <Madtoaster> There are two... well, like Gods, The Unity Spirit, and Banish, (These names are just the common names, different languages call them different things)
[3:55] <Traviskolber> Ez, I sent in another report.
[3:55] <Traviskolber> Please take a look.
[3:56] <Traviskolber> It requests a lock on a thread that has been answered.
[3:56] <RavenBurga> Lol
[3:56] <Madtoaster> The "Gods" change upon differences of belief, The Unity Spirit is basically thought of as a bringer of life and peace, while Banish the opposite, not neccisarily evil, just chaotic and deathlu.
[3:56] <Madtoaster> ly*
[3:56] <Spaffy> Damn it I will keep trying until I get in
[3:56] <RavenBurga> Travis = ez'.s pet

[3:57] <Madtoaster> However, due to some thoughts that Banish is evil, he is also slightly evil.
[3:57] <cynicalAlchemist> So, the SMP servers are online?
[3:57] <bearz> ..is the smpo code still leaked? :d or is it changed
[3:57] <Spaffy> You mean the code to get in?
[3:57] <Epitaph64> bearz: it's the same and it's full still
[3:57] <RavenBurga> !!Thomas!!
[3:57] <Traviskolber> Bearz, if a code is leaked, it stays leaked.
[3:57] <bearz> kay
[3:57] <Conde> Notch said the PW in his twitter
[3:57] <Traviskolber> Especially when it reaches /v/
[3:57] <Epitaph64> you might get in but it will just boot you in about a minute
[3:57] <Shadaez> Actually, I fixed the leak. It's all good now!
[3:57] <Conde> it's leaked, -releaked and uberleaked
[3:57] <bearz> i mean that.. has notch changed it yet
[3:57] <Phil> mkay, what about the people/races Mad?
[3:57] <Traviskolber> I fixed it with a plug.
[3:57] <Madtoaster> The worlds "people" are split into clans.
[3:57] <bearz> ...so i mean is there new odates
[3:57] <Madtoaster> Hahaha
[3:57] <Traviskolber> :D
[3:57] <Spaffy> How many players do you think it holds?
[3:58] <Traviskolber> 20.
[3:58] <RavenBurga> Madtoaster
[3:58] <SteGriff> Traviskolber, I will address your report.
[3:58] <Madtoaster> These clans are physically and mentally different.
[3:58] <Snake_Logan> 40!
[3:58] <Madtoaster> Yess?
[3:58] <Spaffy> Shit, only 20?
[3:58] <Traviskolber> Stegriff, you aren't mod.
[3:58] <Traviskolber> Gtfo.
[3:58] <RavenBurga> One of the clans is ROTA
[3:58] <charrr> Notch said it could go up to 25
[3:58] <Traviskolber> Spaffy, it was MEANT for 20.
[3:58] <Madtoaster> What?
[3:58] <charrr> but it is set to 20
[3:58] <Madtoaster> Im talking about my STORY.
[3:58] <Snake_Logan> The player cap is 40!
[3:58] <Traviskolber> The password was leaked, thus leading to 30,000+ people trying to connect.
[3:58] <Traviskolber> Hey Charr.
[3:58] <RavenBurga> One of them is rota k?
[3:58] <Traviskolber> I'm going to miss your overlook of the port =/
[3:58] <SteGriff> Traviskolber, You're talking about MCF, right?
[3:58] <SteGriff> I see your report
[3:58] <Madtoaster> Orite.
[3:58] <Madtoaster> Nah.
[3:58] <Spaffy> If somebody is in, tell us when you log out so we can try to get in
[3:58] <charrr> hello, Travis
[3:58] <Madtoaster> The clans are basically races.
[3:58] <RavenBurga> Pleeaaassee
[3:59] <Spaffy> Its a fruitless effort, yes, but I like to stay positive.
[3:59] <Traviskolber> Stegriff, what? O.o
[3:59] * Xini (jostein_li@cm-84.210.20.23.getinternet.no) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[3:59] <Madtoaster> Some of the clans are bird like, others like sloths,
[3:59] <SteGriff> I am a mob, you spoon.
[3:59] <Traviskolber> Charrr, next time, no hints :P
[3:59] <SteGriff> I'm both a mob and a mod
[3:59] <Traviskolber> You are a mob?
[3:59] <Phil> STOP INTERUPTING HIM
[3:59] <Phil> IM TRYING TO READ IT
[3:59] <Traviskolber> XD
[3:59] <Madtoaster> Others remotely human, but, with differences.
[3:59] <Traviskolber> So Stegriff, what does my report say?
[3:59] <Bodie> so i find this castle in SMP
[3:59] <Shadaez> Traviskolber he's a mod
[3:59] <RavenBurga> Here's my story
[3:59] <Bodie> and inside... its digging itself
[3:59] <Shadaez> not all mods are OP's in #minecraft
[3:59] <Bodie> just mining away, by itself
[3:59] <RavenBurga> In the land of Ogard
[4:00] <Madtoaster> Basically, the Gods choose members of the Clans to be their servants, or prophets.
[4:00] <SteGriff> Reported by Traviskolber on 27 Jul 2010 10:55 Thread has been answered. Might as well lock it so it isn't necro'd or spammed in.
[4:00] <Traviskolber> They should be.
[4:00] <Traviskolber> Yup.
[4:00] <Demki> SteGriff, you're here?
[4:00] <RavenBurga> There was a young warrior in tebwaiting
[4:00] <Traviskolber> Legit.

[4:00] <Spaffy> I will not log out of minecraft for the rest of the day if I manage to get in, though.
[4:00] <Madtoaster> Due to the fact that lots of evil cults worship Banish as an Evil god (which truely he is not)
[4:01] <RavenBurga> Don't bag banish
[4:01] <Madtoaster> They are usually chosen, and usually do bad things,
[4:01] <Traviskolber> Spaffy.
[4:01] <Madtoaster> Like, I duuno, killing people.
[4:01] <RavenBurga> He's hot
[4:01] <Traviskolber> You are wasting your time.
[4:01] <Traviskolber> Don't even attempt to get in.

[4:01] <Madtoaster> The Unity Spirit chooses people to learn the Lore and Stories of each Clan,
[4:01] <Spaffy> Yeah, a friend of mine got in, and he said its glitchy as hell.
[4:01] <Shadaez> SMP isn't worth it until it's released into Beta, probably. Not worth your time.
[4:01] <Traviskolber> Fine, fine, you are a mod, Stegriff :P
[4:02] <Madtoaster> So they can spread each others stories and unite them.
[4:02] <Traviskolber> Spaffy, it isn't only glitchy.
[4:02] * RavenBurga (Trolol@CPE-124-190-25-219.obcz1.win.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[4:02] <Traviskolber> It is being griefed to hell and back.
[4:02] <Spaffy> Which reminds me.
[4:02] <Spaffy> How in God's name will Notch prevent griefers?
[4:03] <Phil> private servers :)
[4:03] <Traviskolber> Stegriff, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't talking about editing not alloweD?
[4:03] <Madtoaster> These messengers or "prophets" are called Spirit Souls, for those chosen by the Unity Spirit, but those who follow VBanish usually dont have names.
[4:03] <cynicalAlchemist> How hard would it be to develop a queue system?
[4:03] <SteGriff> Talking about editing what?
[4:03] <Madtoaster> What else.
[4:03] <RavenBurga> Booby
[4:03] <Spaffy> I don't know why, but I always pictured multiplayer as being an MMO.
[4:03] <Epitaph64> I can't think of many games with dedicated servers that have a queue system
[4:03] <RavenBurga> Me too
[4:03] <Shrub> wooo doctor who
[4:03] <Spaffy> Though I know that as a concept is ridiculous.
[4:03] <Demki> Notch's next twitter message will be his 1337th.
[4:03] <Tal> Would be nice if notch released a server client even if it is buggy, too many peeps only one server
[4:03] <Spaffy> It saddens me.
[4:03] <Traviskolber> Doctor Who = epic win.
[4:04] <Zaneo> agreed
[4:04] <Epitaph64> the closest I've seen is steam allowing you to poll the server every 10 seconds but it's just a client automation
[4:04] <lifeless> * 1,336 tweets
[4:04] <lifeless> lol so it is
[4:04] <Shadaez> IS joining SA really worth it
[4:04] <Darth_GW7> Is the multiplayer server still going? :(
[4:04] <RavenBurga> Booby
[4:04] <Spaffy> no
[4:04] <Spaffy> no to shadez.
[4:04] <Traviskolber> Darth, yes.
[4:04] <Phil> Mad: Are the clans doing anything? Or just kinda exist?
[4:04] <Madtoaster> Im gonna illustrate the book.
[4:04] <Traviskolber> But it isn't even worth trying to get on.
[4:04] <Madtoaster> Story*
[4:04] <Madtoaster> Whatever.
[4:04] <Shrub> Traviskolber: Shit yeah son
[4:04] <Shadaez> Spaffy why
[4:04] <Tal> >Implying SA isn't a steaming pile of creeper $#&!
[4:04] <RavenBurga> Booby
[4:04] <Traviskolber> Shrub, say what?
[4:04] <Madtoaster> I may just do some drawings, scan them, then put them on to PC.

[4:05] <Madtoaster> Where I can write around them.
[4:05] <RavenBurga> Well my clan is discussing tactics
[4:05] <Spaffy> Because the Something Awful community is a horrible place.
[4:05] <RavenBurga> And city plans
[4:05] <Shadaez> I want a good forum to be a part of, FP is pretty terrible
[4:05] <Phil> MAD FINISH YOUR STORY

[4:06] <Snowman> It's something with a sheep
[4:06] <Viral> stacked ontop of another
[4:06] <Compo> yes]

[4:07] <Traviskolber> From the TV show.
[4:07] <Shrub> holy shit
[4:07] <Shrub> Thomas the Tank Engine
[4:07] <Shrub> Was so fucking awesome

[4:07] <KillingSpree> Not really.
[4:07] <Madtoaster> They would obviously build underwater.
[4:07] <RavenBurga> Booby
[4:08] <Madtoaster> And have floating/above water areas for visitors.
[4:08] <Traviskolber> I can't wait for giant underwater bubble cities O_o
[4:08] <Tal> Would be funny if the server autokicked everyone every fifteen minutes, give people a chance to jump in build a little ect
[4:08] <Morbid> I've gotten into it like 3 times :(
[4:08] <Traviskolber> Star Wars episode one, anyone? :D
[4:08] <Morbid> Can't seem to get back in now.
[4:08] <Madtoaster> Yeah, but then Notch will get kicked.

[4:08] <Traviskolber> It isn't worth it.

[4:22] <cynicalAlchemist> Well, I didn't have that much luck with the game but I learned one thing. When SMP comes out, there will be not many trees.
[4:22] <Zuriki> Notch took it down
[4:22] <cynicalAlchemist> He's going to work on it.
[4:22] <Tal> NOOOOOOOOO
[4:22] <Morbid> NOOOOOO
[4:22] <DDRJake> excellent
[4:22] <Morbid> Yeah
[4:22] <Zuriki> I hope he changes the password
[4:22] <Morbid> Trees = Rare
[4:23] <Tal> WRYYYY
[4:23] <Zuriki> And makes it private
[4:23] <Morbid> :(
[4:23] <Morbid> Don't be a killjoy
[4:23] <Wizeon> hi, i'm having some beginner problems
[4:23] <Wizeon> the guide, http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v487/lufagathrath/minecraftguide2-1.jpg
[4:23] <DDRJake> if he's takingi t down it means he's working on it
[4:23] <Tal> Sucks to not even get in before it went down.....
[4:23] <Wizeon> tells to shop trees at step 2
[4:23] <Wizeon> i've been punching the same tree for 5 mins and nothing happens? :(
[4:23] <Wizeon> so how do i get planks to craft my first house
[4:23] <cynicalAlchemist> Well, I'm going to cherish the time I had on SMP.
[4:24] <Aexis_Rai> Oh, he gave out the pass
[4:24] <cynicalAlchemist> Even through it was but a short taste of what will come.
[4:24] <Aexis_Rai> Suh-weet
[4:24] <Viral> !!Thomas!!
[4:24] <Willox> hAI
[4:24] <Bodie> Wizeon, you put the wood logs in your crafting bit in your inventory
[4:24] <Willox> Oops caps
[4:24] <Tal> Hope he releases a alpha server client so we can all try it. >_>
[4:24] <Snowman> Zuriki, yeah
[4:24] <Aexis_Rai> ...But what an odd pass

[4:25] <Fiskie> Zaneo: no
[4:25] <Einherjar> O:
[4:25] <Zuriki> I like how the people I am talking about have a shot at me
[4:25] <Snowman> Einherjar, the code was everwhere
[4:25] <KingSam> Zuriki, it's hardly ruined
[4:25] <Snowman> So Notch just said what it was

[4:25] <KingSam> it's still awesome
[4:25] <Cat> lol they mad
[4:26] <Einherjar> So then there's no one to blame for leaking it, then

[4:26] <MPeti> hi all
[4:26] <MPeti> KS :D
[4:26] <lifeless> he put it on his twitter so that now that pretty much everyone knows..then EVERYONE could know lol
[4:26] <KingSam> MPeti, SMP was funnn
[4:26] <KingSam> :D long time no see
[4:26] <MPeti> I tried to get on a ton of times
[4:26] <MPeti> never managed...
[4:26] <lifeless> i gave up lol
[4:26] <KingSam> :p
[4:26] <KingSam> it was funfunfun
[4:26] <MPeti> It's offline now for today or did it just crash?
[4:26] <KingSam> it just went offline like 5 mins ago
[4:26] <RavenBurga> Offline
[4:27] <KingSam> notch will probably change code too :p
[4:27] <Aexis_Rai> Well would you look at that. 5 minutes.
[4:27] <MPeti> Lol at "SMP code is !!Thomas!! , have fun looking at a "server is full" message!"
[4:27] <Aexis_Rai> I say again, my timing is more horrible than Animators

[4:28] <Morbid> It was still fun
[4:28] <Snowman> blaster, grief, explosions, fire, rape, plundering, farming, mayhem, chaos, etc.
[4:28] <Morbid> You just had to wander away a bit
[4:28] <Compo> yes
[4:28] <Conde> I just joined it and it crashed like 30 seconds after
[4:28] <KodaichiZerq> silly Nadeo and their frenchness. well anyway grats to anyone who got in on smp testing
[4:28] <KodaichiZerq> gtg

[4:28] <lifeless> maybe hes gonna release an update soon
[4:29] <blaster> Yep
[4:29] <lifeless> so he took it down to update it? xD

[4:29] <MPeti> I wonder if SMP is off because it crashed, or because he shut it down willingly?
[4:29] <Snowman> lifeless, he can update it without taking it down
[4:29] <blaster> I think he will HAVE to give out the buggy server software soon
[4:29] <blaster> Even if it barely functions
[4:29] <Snowman> He doesn't have to do anything
[4:29] <blaster> Because he is not going to be able to test otherwise
[4:29] <Conde> I even managed to stream a little bit of it http://www.livestream.com/cenodesamfias/video?clipId=pla_8bdc10e5-85ac-4fc7-b5af-431c1c5f5910&utm_source=lslibrary&utm_medium=ui-thumb
[4:29] <Snowman> It's his game
[4:29] <MPeti> Does anyone know if it crashed or has been shut down?
[4:29] <lifeless> well... maybe he wanted to take it down
[4:29] <lifeless> lol
[4:29] <Snowman> If he just doesn't allow the "invite everyone you know and ever met"
[4:29] <RavenBurga> What was the dock like?
[4:30] <Shrub> Maybe he's making two
[4:30] <Cat> sum SMP pics at MineChan http://fragmer.net/minechan/m/res/464.html
[4:30] <lifeless> lol that was set on fire yesterday i saw on livestream
[4:30] <Ronjoe> Snowman, he DOES have to make an income, so dont pull that "he doesnt have to do anything" bullshit
[4:30] <KillingSpree> It's honestly not like smp is very interesting
[4:30] <lifeless> hes talking about updating

[4:31] <Fiskie> PORT IS ON FIRE
[4:31] <Fiskie> GET THE WATER
[4:31] <KillingSpree> Shinki: Probably not.
[4:31] <Snowman> I think he shouldn't release a version that is only half-finished
[4:31] <Twangy> http://imgur.com/lriil.jpg
[4:31] <Viral> you can host your own mc servers right?
[4:31] <Viral> for SMP
[4:31] <Twangy> Last thing I saw before I died
[4:31] <Deages> yes viral
[4:31] <Snowman> Viral, nope
[4:31] <Deages> soon
[4:31] <Deages> not yet though
[4:31] <Snowman> Not yet
[4:31] <Viral> i'll just make one with my bros
[4:31] <Shinki> You must not hav fun in just regular survival mode then
[4:31] <Viral> yeah i nkow
[4:31] <Deages> meanwhile
[4:31] <blaster> Snowman, even if its half finished its still fun
[4:31] <blaster> Isnt that the point of an alpha?
[4:31] <Deages> I'll be hosting a 24 slot server in a half-gated community
[4:31] <Snowman> Yeah, but it's still horribly broken
[4:32] <KillingSpree> ^
[4:32] <blaster> Thats what makes it fun
[4:32] <Snowman> Would you release something that is broken as hell?
[4:32] <Snowman> Makes servers unstable
[4:32] <KillingSpree> No blaster
[4:32] <Nunu> np: Virial theme http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4lvcCklBS8
[4:32] <Deages> for testing snowman
[4:32] <blaster> Yes, if it was fun
[4:32] <Deages> yes
[4:32] <KillingSpree> Not at all
[4:32] <Deages> otherwise no
[4:32] <Nunu> f-ing typo :D
[4:32] <Deages> that's what you're forgetting
[4:32] <Deages> it's in alpha testing
[4:32] <Deages> not a finished product
[4:32] <blaster> And with more people its easier to test more things
[4:32] <Aexis_Rai> So... the error I should be getting is "Failed to connect: connection timed out", or are other people getting other errors?
[4:32] <Deages> hundreds of people using something and finding bugs is better than 5
[4:32] <RavenBurga> Snowma, so that notch can getnbugs found
[4:32] * Roadcrosser (im-a-pc@116.206.190.165) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[4:32] <blaster> For example, notch is not going to try every single possible combination of two blocks stuck together to check for glitches
[4:33] <Conde> I got the same error aexis
[4:33] * Cial (chatzilla@68.170.96.228) has joined #minecraft
[4:33] <RavenBurga> Blaster he could make that automatically
[4:33] <Conde> connection timed out: connect
[4:33] <Twangy> Same here.
[4:33] <Shinki> Im
[4:33] <Aexis_Rai> Mmkay
[4:33] <RavenBurga> But anyway
[4:33] <Rossco> the server is down, that's why it's timing out
[4:33] <Snowman> blaster, sure, it needs bigger scale testing
[4:33] <Snowman> But not yet
[4:33] <blaster> For example, there might be a glitch where a bookcase connected to lava explodes
[4:33] <Shinki> I'm more interested in that Notch isn't coding this thing very server side, which seems odd to me
[4:33] <Cial> Conde, its full
[4:33] <Snowman> The current problems should be fixed first
[4:33] <Shrub> blaster
[4:33] <Cial> oh or down
[4:33] <Shrub> that'd be a kickass glitch
[4:33] <RavenBurga> Blaster that would be a feature
[4:33] <Snowman> And if this works, there should be bigger scale testing
[4:33] <blaster> Shinki more and more will be added to serverside
[4:34] <Aexis_Rai> A different channel is saying something about a different error, probably because its topic is outdated
[4:34] <blaster> as he gets more finished
[4:34] <Shinki> well he's in the wrong direction on the programming side if reading his blog right
[4:34] <cynicalAlchemist> That black hole glitch was fun and afterwards I found 3 pieces of iron where I respawned.
[4:34] <blaster> So far it seems that the void bug can be fixed by placing a block there
[4:34] <blaster> Sometimes a chunk is completely missing though
[4:34] <KillingSpree> no
[4:34] <Aexis_Rai> Black hole?
[4:34] <Conde> it's down, not full, i got a huge lag while i was inside
[4:34] <Shinki> blackholes sound cool
[4:35] <Rossco> the void bug is clientside I believe
[4:35] <RavenBurga> How big are chunks?
[4:35] <Conde> and then timeout
[4:35] <KillingSpree> It's clientside
[4:35] <blaster> 32X32
[4:35] <RavenBurga> Lol
[4:35] <MPeti> 16x16 I think
[4:35] <Rossco> for people who haven't seen them yet: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6036389/void.PNG
[4:35] <Phil> 16
[4:35] <Ronjoe> 16x16
[4:35] <RavenBurga> I made a 64x64 strip mine
[4:35] <Phil> wow awesome blackwhole
[4:35] <lifeless> now that is a blackhole!
[4:35] <lifeless> xD
[4:35] <Phil> even fits the cube theme
[4:35] <blaster> The most important bug to fix right now would be to make smelters work
[4:35] <Shrub> holy shit
[4:35] <Traviskolber> Sigh.

[4:36] <Viral> that's just shadows not rendering properly isn't it?
[4:36] <Aexis_Rai> That's a whole missing chunk.
[4:36] <Traviskolber> Blaster, like?...
[4:36] <cynicalAlchemist> Well, I thought it was awesome.
[4:36] <Shrub> Blackhole is awesome
[4:36] <Phil> travis: lol
[4:36] <Traviskolber> Aexis, actually, it is a massive hole.

[4:36] <Viral> furnaces*
[4:36] <Traviskolber> Yet.
[4:37] <Shrub> :D
[4:37] <Traviskolber> Blaster, the only thing missing really is iron.
[4:37] <Phil> wow
[4:37] <Viral> i was just minicing what he said
[4:37] <Viral> shuttup
[4:37] <blaster> Thats the problem
[4:37] <Viral> mimicing*
[4:37] <Traviskolber> And we had a command to give it to us.
[4:37] <Snowman> That's what /iron is for
[4:37] <blaster> Without iron you cannot dig gold, diamond or redstone
[4:37] <Shrub> I read that as 'Mincing'
[4:37] <blaster> Does redstone stuff work?
[4:37] <Traviskolber> And we had a command to give it to us <_<
[4:37] <Traviskolber> We don't know.

[4:37] <Traviskolber> We didn't bother mining it.
[4:37] <RavenBurga> Yeah blaster
[4:37] <Traviskolber> We were busy building a port.
[4:37] <blaster> Oh. well thats something that needs testing
[4:37] <Snowman> blaster, no, redstone circuits are broken
[4:37] <blaster> Did you get a screenshot of the port?
[4:37] <Traviskolber> I wish :(
[4:38] <Traviskolber> It was epic.
[4:38] <Zaneo> redstone stuff works, i made an odd loop earlier
[4:38] <Aexis_Rai> How does this black hole thing happen?
[4:38] <Traviskolber> And now we'll never see it again.
[4:38] <Traviskolber> Aexis, we don't know.
[4:38] <Traviskolber> But Notch does.
[4:38] <Zaneo> a chunk isn't loaded by the client
[4:38] <Snowman> Zaneo, when I tried it, it was broken
[4:38] <Shrub> Notch should make that server say 'please grief, I want to test bugs'
[4:38] <Traviskolber> And he says he'll fix it.
[4:38] <Shrub> then when they grief
[4:38] <Shrub> kick them for griefing
[4:38] <Zaneo> It was really laggy for me snowman
[4:38] <MPeti> Well, Notch said he THINKS he knows why the holes happen
[4:38] <Zaneo> like 1 cycle every 3-5 seconds
[4:38] <blaster> Hmm
[4:38] <Ronjoe> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPvqRRL58Xg
[4:38] <MPeti> anyway, they're clientside that's for sure
[4:38] <Ronjoe> this port?
[4:38] <Shrub> Stephen Hawking also thinks the same thing.
[4:38] <blaster> Any idea on how to link 6 iron doors to one console
[4:38] <Ronjoe> the one butnt down?
[4:38] <Rossco> he told me and someone else that he thinks the server binaries are coming in a week
[4:38] <Traviskolber> YES!
[4:39] <Traviskolber> That one!

[5:12] <Quatroking> new game
[5:12] <Fiskie> Better systems
[5:12] <Traviskolber> Muddtusk, large DLC.
[5:12] <Fiskie> Should be better than FO3
[5:13] <- *Jake333* sup??
[5:13] <muddtusk> Hmm
[5:13] <Traviskolber> They added a bunch of weapons, a bunch of missions and call it a new game.
[5:13] <Traviskolber> Think iPhone 4.
[5:13] <muddtusk> You know of any mechanics that have changed?

[5:16] <Fiskie> It was boring for me
[5:16] <JJXB> Fiskie: new vegas will actually be an rpg for a start.
[5:16] <arlnet> I concur with mudd
[5:16] <Traviskolber> I'm playing Minecraft. Do you think I care for the pace? x.x
[5:16] <Fiskie> JJXB: yes
[5:16] <Traviskolber> It just isn't my type of game.
[5:16] <Fiskie> http://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/
[5:16] <JJXB> unlike the crap that bethesda came out with for RPG elements.
[5:16] <arlnet> Bethesda never makes quality games
[5:16] <arlnet> They didn't even make most of fallout 3
[5:16] <muddtusk> :|
[5:17] <arlnet> Obsidian did, Bethesda bought it near the end
[5:17] <Darkfire002> Bethesda?
[5:17] <Fiskie> Reputation system is back as well
[5:17] <arlnet> Guess who made the sh*tty ending?

[5:17] <JJXB> if bethesda didn't do fallout 3 then how come the writing was so bad?

[5:18] <Traviskolber> I heard Oblivion IV is very good.
[5:18] <Fiskie> yeah
[5:18] <ChJees> A new Fallout is better than no Fallout :P
[5:18] <ZacharyLy> Can I ask if the server is up?
[5:18] <Traviskolber> And long.
[5:18] <Zaneo> it's down
[5:18] <muddtusk> JJBX, dialogue, story or both?
[5:18] <ZacharyLy> Thankyou.
[5:18] <sppt> oblivion was good
[5:18] <Fiskie> FO3 was too locked down
[5:18] <JJXB> mudd: both.
[5:18] <Traviskolber> Guess what?
[5:18] <Fiskie> And the DLC had more potential
[5:18] <Traviskolber> It is made by Bethesda.
[5:18] <Traviskolber> :)
[5:18] <Morbid> TES IV: Oblivion?
[5:18] <Fiskie> Especially operation anchorage
[5:18] <sppt> yeah
[5:19] <JJXB> strength requirements are back in new vegas as are other stat penalties though. so you can acutally have fun with a low INT character unlike in fallout 3
[5:19] <Fiskie> Could have been better
[5:19] <muddtusk> You guys ever play the settlers mod for FO3?
[5:19] <Morbid> They need to come out with a new one already. Morrowind was still the best
[5:19] <Traviskolber> So if you look at FO3 and sad Bethesda doesn't make good quality games.
[5:19] <Fiskie> JJXB: there's also hardcore mode in New Vegas
[5:19] <Traviskolber> And then say Oblivion is good.
[5:19] <Traviskolber> You are such a fucking hypocrite :)

[5:19] <Fiskie> Need to be fulfilled or you die
[5:19] <arlnet> I agree, Oblivion sounds decent. But not something i'm going to buy.
[5:20] <JJXB> Fiskie: something that was going to be in fallout 2. but they didn't have time to finish it
[5:20] <sppt> fallout as a whole doesnt interest me
[5:20] <Traviskolber> I may buy it.
[5:20] <sppt> i find shooters to be boring in general
[5:20] <sppt> just gimme a sword
[5:20] <Fiskie> Fallout is good for mods as well
[5:20] <Traviskolber> If I ever get to spend money after the spree I started two months ago.
[5:20] <Morbid> If bethesda updated Morrowind with newer graphics/physics it'd be the best game ever. i got sooo bored of Oblivion.
[5:20] <JJXB> sppt: new vegas isn't a shooter.
[5:20] <JJXB> fallout 3 was a shooter, i'll say that much
[5:20] <Fiskie> Yeah
[5:20] <muddtusk> sppt: my frist FO3 build was stealth/melee
[5:20] <Shinki> I haven't liked Bethesda since Daggerfall
[5:20] <sppt> Morbid, you should check out the mod "nehrim"
[5:20] <Traviskolber> I spent so much money in the last two months on games, it isn't even funny X_X
[5:20] <Fiskie> Fallout 3 was just generic explorer fps
[5:20] <Shinki> I thought Morrowind was a step in the wrong direction
[5:20] <muddtusk> frist aint aword, btw
[5:20] <arlnet> sc2 came out, portal 2 soon, minecraft smp soon

[5:22] <Traviskolber> Then Notch was like "Screw it" and fucked around with us by letting everyone in.
[5:22] <DatOneGuy> Notch gave it out after, but it's off topic, there's a channel for that

[5:54] <muddtusk> arlnet, I was more interested with creating a large overhead map. How would I go about creating invis textures?
[5:54] <Ominus> does anyone know if you delet a folder in your world save willt aht area be regenerated or just a empty space?
[5:54] <RavenBurga> Good question
[5:54] <Ronjoe> easily testable
[5:54] <SmokestormX> whats folder
[5:54] <arlnet> Unlike windows, if you open a .jar with its default opening tool, it pulls up a zip-like content
[5:55] <Willox> WinRar opens it like that
[5:55] <RavenBurga> Booby
[5:55] <muddtusk> Yeah, I have changed the default opening application, but I can change it back.
[5:55] <arlnet> you can just take out the textures.png (its in the root folder of minecraft.jar), make an original copy, and edit one
[5:55] <Shrub> Let me answer that with a Pie Chart
[5:55] <Shrub> http://www.27bslash6.com/images/simons_graphs_03.gif
[5:55] <Ominus> apparently some of the files in my world folder got corrupted but checkdisk somewhat fixed them except now that i try to enter an area i already explored a bit the game just freezes
[5:55] <arlnet> Hm, just open it with archive manager

[6:30] <Shinki> I agree, most people in the military are pretty lulzy mentally

[6:30] <Wildstyle> I was on the beach watching fireworks at news years in 1999
[6:30] <Shinki> But I work in intel, everyone is smart and eccentric

[6:31] <Shinki> Insta ban
[6:31] <Wildstyle> an aussie would never misspell beer
[6:31] <Morbid> Pretty much.
[6:31] <Diablodoct0r> The bad side about negative isn't the intelligence, it's the fact that it's the military. People die because of you, and you die because of people. If your superiors see you as expendable, you don't have any human worth left.

[6:31] <Morbid> There's some smart infantry guys... but they're few and far apart.
[6:31] <RagamuffinJoe> lol elitists
[6:32] <Diablodoct0r> Then again, there are people doing paperwork their entire lives in the military
[6:32] <Morbid> Eh... yeah.
[6:32] <Shinki> No one is seen as expendable, even if just numbers. Some of us costs thousands upon thousands of dollars to train
[6:32] <Diablodoct0r> I'd rather serve the rest of society than them though
[6:32] <Morbid> Some of them are batshit crazy.
[6:32] <Shinki> they don't want to get rid of us
[6:32] <Morbid> Tech Jobs :D
[6:32] <Diablodoct0r> Shinki: That's not correct. Many soldiers have been "left behind" or sent in suicide missions just to make a vital distraction.
[6:32] <Morbid> Or... Intel jobs.
[6:33] <BipolarWafflez> But infantry are more expendable than intel officers ;)
[6:33] <Morbid> Hell even aviation mechanics/electricians
[6:33] <Shinki> Not in the US military under current doctrine.
[6:33] <RagamuffinJoe> What
[6:33] <RagamuffinJoe> the
[6:33] <RagamuffinJoe> fuck
[6:33] <Diablodoct0r> You'd be surprised, Shinki..
[6:33] <Shinki> No I wouldn't
[6:33] <Diablodoct0r> Money comes above soldiers.
[6:33] <Shinki> Because it hasn't happened.
[6:33] <BipolarWafflez> it's easier to retrain a rifleman/engineer than an officer
[6:33] <Morbid> If you say so.
[6:33] <Diablodoct0r> They don't sacrifice a good soldier. Unless it costs more to get him out.
[6:33] <Nunuru> WTF, I love how offtopic this channel goes, few minutes ago i saw someone talking about bondage and now you are talking about military suicide missions. :)

[6:55] <Demki> I think this is just a HUUUUUUUUUUGE land mass.
[6:55] <ez> Demki is lost sitting in a tree! :P:P
[6:55] <Demki> o.O
[6:55] <mezo> did it the dummy way by just screenshotting a dirt tile and then lifting the colors of each pixel
[6:55] <ez> hey Cat
[6:55] <Demki> It takes so long to save.
[6:55] <Koramei> Demki how long have you had that save

[6:56] <Koramei> because the ones from before Notch changed the save format got messed up
[6:56] <Demki> Koramei, about a week.
[6:56] <ez> mezo, kinda how i made my lava skin, screenshot, then just copy paste almost
[6:56] <Koramei> oh

[6:56] <mezo> if i knew i'd have done it
[6:57] <Morbid> If you have photoshop
[6:57] * Merciless nods
[6:57] <mezo> i'm sure it's possible to grab the textures from the game
[6:57] <Wildstyle> Merciless
[6:57] <Merciless> i do
[6:57] <Morbid> Take the actually terrain file from the minecraft.jar
[6:57] <Koramei> just go into the .jar and take the stuff
[6:57] <Koramei> yes
[6:57] <Koramei> not hard at all
[6:57] <Wildstyle> you can always just paste a big line of the block
[6:57] <Demki> ez, want me to upload my save?
[6:57] <Wildstyle> onto the skin
[6:57] <Morbid> Go to the prefences and set the reziing to nearest neighbor?
[6:57] <Morbid> I think
[6:57] <Morbid> And just transform up
[6:57] <Wildstyle> and makesure the grass is at the edge of the face
[6:57] <Morbid> It'll keep the sharp edges
[6:57] * Fisheatsbear (Fish@74.194.196.81) has joined #minecraft
[6:57] <Merciless> nice
[6:57] <Morbid> Up to any res you want AFAIK
[6:57] <Merciless> the scaling is what i was worried abt
[6:57] <ez> Demki: might be fun to browse others maps to see what they've done =)
[6:57] <FM4k> It'll still blur after a large enough size..
[6:58] <Morbid> It's got to be nearest neighbor to be sharp at resize
[6:58] <FM4k> I think 2048x2048 is where nearest-neighbor begins to fail in CS4
[6:58] <FM4k> I think they doubled that in CS5

[7:26] <Outpost> Meh, I refuse to buy it.
[7:27] <Outpost> Blizzard/Activision is pulling too much shit for me to support them.
[7:27] <Koramei> I refuse to buy sc2 for now
[7:27] <SmokestormX> I cant see anything in this dark night cycle...
[7:27] <Koramei> but I played the beta since march
[7:27] <Koramei> I'm gonna get it eventually
[7:27] <Merciless> polan will check it
[7:27] <Koramei> although with what activision is doing/planning on doing they're going to take a fall sometime soon

[7:28] <Miclee> Activision is fucking up bad.
[7:28] <Outpost> More so, Starcraft 2 is the exact same game as SC1, minus an expansion... with prettier graphics.
[7:28] <Koramei> some of that stuff is just unbelievable
[7:28] <Outpost> WTF is this? The Sims?
[7:28] <Koramei> no it isn't Outpost
[7:28] <Koramei> it's completely different
[7:28] <Koramei> did you even play it?
[7:28] <polan> it's similar..
[7:28] <Outpost> I ran a few times in Beta.
[7:28] <Koramei> in the same way it's set in the same universe
[7:28] <Koramei> it plays entirely differently
[7:28] <polan> couple units changed nothing more
[7:28] <Koramei> well
[7:28] <Miclee> I still don't think it's worth a buy.
[7:28] <Quatroking> Outpost, the the exact same game except with less features
[7:28] <Koramei> other than being rts
[7:28] <Outpost> What Polan said.
[7:28] <Quatroking> its the*
[7:29] <polan> but blizzard said they won't change too much : P
[7:29] <Outpost> And Quatroking.
[7:29] <Koramei> most of the units are different and it plays very differently
[7:29] <Merciless> polan NICE find
[7:29] <Koramei> I can testify as someone that played it a ton
[7:29] <Koramei> both of them
[7:29] <Quatroking> Didn't they cut off LAN?

[7:29] <Quatroking> Blizzard was a nice company. Then they made World of Warcraft.
[7:29] <Koramei> eh
[7:29] <Outpost> Koramei: Neither does blizzard, that's why it's $180 for the full game.
[7:29] <polan> Merciless it's polsh group "Grupa MoCarta" :) you should check youtube for them, they make amazing stuff with that kind of music : D
[7:29] <Quatroking> Now its, well, shit
[7:29] <Miclee> South Korean WoW players get it for free because most will take place in Blizzard's tournaments, which gets Blizzard even more money.
[7:29] <Koramei> lol
[7:29] <polan> quatroking I agree ^^
[7:30] <polan> wow was slap in face..
[7:30] <Merciless> cool
[7:30] <Koramei> I'm going to get it eventually because I've been playing it on a practically daily basis for the past 4 months
[7:30] <Koramei> but they are ripping us off
[7:30] <Quatroking> Guys, at least you're not in europe
[7:30] <Outpost> And you're one of the reasons why they will continue to do so and get away with it.
[7:30] <Hyst> ...
[7:30] <Hyst> $180 for SC2?
[7:30] <Koramei> by not buying it?

[7:31] <Miclee> Helar: Activision in general is shit.
[7:31] <Quatroking> they just replace the valuta symbol
[7:31] <Outpost> Game company does bullshit things. Everyone STILL buys it. They're going to continue doing bullshit things.
[7:31] <Koramei> I doubt they'll charge $60 for the other ones, it'll probably be expansions
[7:31] <Draqo> So I am the only person in this chat room, who doesn't like Starcraft2?

[7:31] <Crix> ITS BEAUTIFUL
[7:31] <Kokopure> what does the /spew command do in SMP?

[7:31] <JamesK89> Activision used to be awesome
[7:31] <polan> sad to say but many games get turned into something simple just to fit usa..
[7:31] <Miclee> Activision has turned into a money-wanted whorefest.
[7:31] <JamesK89> But then they became all business and Modern Warfare 2 fiasco happened

[7:31] <Koramei> I used to hate EA but activision is way worse now
[7:31] <Quatroking> for example, a $60 game in the USA, gets sold for 60 EUROS in the EU
[7:32] <Koramei> and EA is getting better
[7:32] <polan> maybe
[7:32] <Miclee> Activision has 4 studios working on CoD games, all of which will suck.
[7:32] <Outpost> Quatroking - at least you're not AU.
[7:32] <destroyerx1> lol
[7:32] <Hyst> oh uyou are SHITTING ME.
[7:32] <JamesK89> I think EA learned from their mistakes to an extent, with Spore being the most pirated game in history
[7:32] <polan> but when I go shop, all games are 20-30$ max, never seen ea games with price under 50-60$
[7:32] <Crix> omgomgomgomg

[7:32] <Hyst> Id stop playing WoW
[7:32] <Hyst> but
[7:32] <Koramei> almost all new releases are $50-60
[7:32] <Hyst> I like playing it.
[7:32] <Quatroking> 60 euros is 78,20 dollers
[7:32] <destroyerx1> learn basic economics
[7:32] <Miclee> destroyerx, 1 game every 2 years meets the supply & demand
[7:32] <polan> not in poland
[7:33] <Miclee> Instead of 4 different games at random times
[7:33] <polan> most new game have 1/2-1/3 of ea price
[7:33] <destroyerx1> the demand is huge
[7:33] <Outpost> Koramei: EA games price drop a lot slower than most other companies. There's exceptions though.
[7:33] <polan> + they drop price pretty fast
[7:33] <JamesK89> I like how people are moving back torward indie games though; like Minecraft, AudioSurf, etc..
[7:33] <Koramei> not slower than activision
[7:33] <destroyerx1> therefore, the price is huge
[7:33] <polan> and ea keep their price high for ages
[7:33] <Miclee> Outpost, a lot of EA's games are good, though.
[7:33] <Koramei> the bigger companies keep the prices high
[7:33] <polan> indie is future :)
[7:33] <Koramei> I think EA is doing stuff wrong, but it is far from the worst
[7:33] <Koramei> ubisoft is worse
[7:33] <polan> Valve price are low : p
[7:33] <destroyerx1> its called capitalism
[7:33] <Quatroking> destroyerx1, don't tell me its due to demand shit
[7:33] <Koramei> and activision is just the bottom
[7:33] <polan> and it's quite big company
[7:33] <Quatroking> they even sell fucking spongebob games this way
[7:33] <Miclee> ^^^
[7:34] <Outpost> I won't deny that. EA isn't as horrible as it used to be. But they won't ever see a penny out of me for Command and Conquer 5 (one of my favorute series) thanks to their bullshit DRM.
[7:34] <JamesK89> Indie games remind me of the golden age of gaming (circa 1980-1995) when companies weren't afraid to experament and create new franchises
[7:34] <Quatroking> Hence why I barely ever buy games in my own country these days
[7:34] <Miclee> EA is slowly learning.

[7:35] <Demki> Fiskie, that's because newer ppl barely know about creative.
[7:35] <Koramei> only the sims is really a rip off now
[7:35] <Outpost> EA forced an early release, dumbing down of the system, and they imposed the entire DRM scam.
[7:35] <Miclee> Spore was supposed to come out in March 2006. >_>
[7:35] <polan> they forced earlier release = cut off many features, I was following spore before release for a bit and it supposed to be quite different game.

[7:36] <polan> most pirated
[7:36] <Koramei> actually the humble indie bundle might well be the most pirated game ever
[7:36] <Outpost> Koramei - Yeah, but now they're replacing it with even MORE archaic DRM, like limited installations, or having to be online to play single player at all times.
[7:36] <Cial> Merciless, pirated on the first day
[7:36] <JamesK89> Tetris is GLORIOUS
[7:36] <polan> original creator got 0.00$ for it.
[7:36] <Koramei> like every other company

[7:37] <Miclee> I just don't want to wait for it to come out. >_<

[7:38] <JamesK89> I thought Mass Effect was all hype, but then I tried it myself and it turned out to be the most epic CRPG ever

[7:39] <JamesK89> 2 years sounds like Valve time
[7:39] <polan> usually it take them longer.
[7:39] <Koramei> they probably just made it easier now
[7:39] <polan> :d
[7:39] <Quatroking> its the exact same thing modders used two years before
[7:39] <polan> in valve time 2 years would be probably "this christmas"

[7:39] <JamesK89> Speaking of Valve... EPISODE 3!!!! DO WANT
[7:39] <Outpost> Quatroking : It could be the frickin' Pope. The fact is for two years modding required a hack to get it to work.
[7:40] <Koramei> Outpost
[7:40] <Koramei> that's not true
[7:40] <Miclee> Ep3 won't happen.
[7:40] <polan> it will..
[7:40] <Koramei> modding has been in it since the beginning
[7:40] <polan> sooner or later.
[7:40] <Koramei> eh soon
[7:40] <Miclee> Portal 2 is going to explain things, and then Half Life 3 will come out.
[7:40] <SireTRM> Episode Three. Some day. Valve time.
[7:40] <Koramei> I want the headcrab hat for tf2 already
[7:40] <Outpost> Modding was in it since the beginning when you applied a custom-built DLL file to the Sims 3 directory.
[7:40] <polan> imho but delaying portal 2 just to make release on ps3 at same time was really bad decision x
[7:40] <Outpost> That's a hack.
[7:40] <Quatroking> Outpost, those two years weren't exactly that much of a hack anyways
[7:40] <Outpost> It was a easy hack, but it's still a hack.
[7:40] <JamesK89> TF2 hats take so much time I don't even bother
[7:40] <Crix> what game?
[7:40] <Quatroking> you edited a line and made a folder
[7:40] <Quatroking> bawwww
[7:40] <Crix> required a hack? for mods?
[7:40] <Quatroking> hacked
[7:40] <Quatroking> done
[7:41] <Quatroking> I don't really see much of a problem with it
[7:41] <Outpost> I'm not bitching it's hard. I'm bitching that you had to do even that for something that the Sims series has specifically been known for.
[7:41] <polan> tf2, I got 200h online time and got only hm... 3 hat. Ghostly gibus(everyone have this),cheater lament and one I crafted.. after 200h ; d

[7:41] <Koramei> Outpost it's like that in most games
[7:41] <Koramei> having to make a mod folder and such
[7:41] <Kokopure> I have Ghastly Gibus
[7:41] <Kokopure> aaaand...
[7:41] <Quatroking> at least EA freely added modding abilities
[7:41] <Koramei> there aren't many that install it by default
[7:41] <Kokopure> the paper bag hat
[7:41] <Hyst> inb4TES4
[7:41] <Kokopure> that's it
[7:41] <Outpost> Sims and Sims 2 supported mods + custom content out of the box.
[7:41] <JamesK89> Parasite hat was cool but everybody and their dog has it
[7:41] <Quatroking> there are thousands of games that don't have that
[7:41] <polan> I don't have it dunno why >..<
[7:41] <JamesK89> Some people installed Alien Swarm just to get the parasite hat, and then uninstalled it.
[7:41] <Miclee> Bioware needs to learn what mod tools are for Mass Effect 3.
[7:41] <Merciless> so hat fortress two, people h avent gotten over that still?
[7:41] <Merciless> jesus
[7:41] <Crix> 30%... i hate waiting
[7:41] <Outpost> Those thousands of games are not a series known for support custom content out of the box.

[7:42] <Outpost> Hyst: You're all missing my point.
[7:42] <Hyst> no,
[7:42] <Hyst> you just suck at making it.
[7:42] <Outpost> Then make it for me.

[7:43] <Hyst> If you mean by out of the box will load ALL mods straight away, then yeah its not out of the box
[7:43] <Merciless> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh7GJl3Z7BE
[7:43] <Outpost> My point is, Sims 1 and Sim 2 supported custom content and modding out of the box, on install. No additional work required. Sims 3 requires you to go to a modd site, download a dll, replace a dll - then keep an old backup on hand to restore it when patches came out and otherwise fuck about.
[7:43] <Merciless> what
[7:43] <Merciless> the
[7:43] <Merciless> fuck
[7:44] <Quatroking> I never had to replace a dll..
[7:44] <Hyst> ^
[7:44] <Outpost> http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=344611
[7:44] <Quatroking> or redo everything when a mod came out

[7:46] <Hyst> polan - DDR.
[7:46] <Quatroking> herp derp
[7:46] <Quatroking> outpost: you add a line or two
[7:46] <Outpost> Whatever.
[7:46] <Quatroking> Its just... damn easy
[7:46] <Outpost> I don't care if it's easy.
[7:46] <Quatroking> Big deal if EA didn't made it out of the box
[7:46] <Hyst> last i checked adding lines isnt replacing
[7:46] <Merciless> its so...wow his feet. god damn
[7:46] <Merciless> so faaast
[7:46] <Outpost> The fact is, a game sold on the premise that custome content/modding is out of the box support - should not lock that out.
[7:47] <Quatroking> they did eventually, something barely any company does

[7:47] <Outpost> I didn't buy, thankfully.
[7:47] <Quatroking> I did buy it eventually because I got tired of cracking it
[7:47] <Quatroking> CE, of course
[7:48] <Outpost> I decided to not buy when I realized they got rid of most of the features of Sims 2, that the first iteration of the game was broken in numerous ways, and lack of will to buy 3-4 expansion packs. (Is that what they're up to now?)

[8:07] <polan> oh
[8:07] <asie[afk]> idk if i'm coding my own physics engine
[8:07] <asie[afk]> or using Box2D
[8:08] <asie[afk]> what do you propose
[8:08] <polan> what laungage you code in?
[8:08] <Cat> Troll#
[8:08] <Cat> i mean C#
[8:08] <Draqo> Don't you mean Troll++?
[8:08] <polan> well I prefer to write everything myself, so I get better control over it :), but it need alot times, and it might be better to use rdy lib.
[8:08] <Draqo> I mean C++*
[8:08] <asie[afk]> Troll# or Trava
[8:09] <asie[afk]> err
[8:09] <Fiskie> Troll# is a good language
[8:09] <asie[afk]> C# or Java
[8:09] <Darkebrz> I hate it when I generate snow levels :|
[8:09] <asie[afk]> C# would mean Silverlight
[8:09] <asie[afk]> Silverlight would mean:
[8:09] <polan> webbrowser.
[8:09] <asie[afk]> polan - that's my goal
[8:09] <asie[afk]> but
[8:09] <polan> and user having to downlaod more stuff to pc..
[8:09] <Ominus> good thing is i now know wich dat files are the FUBARed chunks, now is hall delete them and hope it regenerates that area
[8:09] <asie[afk]> 1) either you use Silverlight 1.0 so the people with Linux can use it (yes, there's silverlight 1.0 for linux open-source)
[8:09] <asie[afk]> 2) or Java
[8:09] <asie[afk]> 3) and i'm not using C++

[8:13] <asie[afk]> should I:
[8:13] <polan> decided , but you know this laungage or you will learn ;)?
[8:13] <asie[afk]> polan: I know it! ;)
[8:13] <SmokestormX> My first day of minecrafting is going well...
[8:13] <asie[afk]> so, should I:
[8:14] <asie[afk]> 1) make my own physics engine and most likely fail as i am 13.5 and not 25
[8:14] <asie[afk]> 2) use Box2D
[8:14] * Iggy is now known as Iguana
[8:14] <asie[afk]> what d'y'think
[8:14] <Jevon> you dont get .5 of a year older
[8:14] <polan> 13,.5 = age :?P age doesn't matter in coding.
[8:14] <asie[afk]> Jevon: Yes i do
[8:14] <Jevon> no you dont
[8:14] <polan> but highly possible that you never heard about many stuff that might be helpfull in coding physics..

[8:15] <asie[afk]> there's uncle wikipedia
[8:15] <Hakaze> its not the coding thats hard
[8:15] <asie[afk]> and aunt tigirc
[8:15] <asie[afk]> or
[8:15] <polan> yes
[8:15] <asie[afk]> vice... versa
[8:15] <Hakaze> its noticing when you made a typo

[8:15] <asie[afk]> polan - yus, that's why i'll probably need a bit of help
[8:15] <polan> and if it's something hard, wikipedia might not be good source for it.
[8:15] <asie[afk]> i guess i'll just use Box2D in the beginning
[8:15] <polan> like rotation matrices, you won't know wtf is that by reading wikipedia
[8:15] <polan> and those might be helpfull for physics :)
[8:16] <asie[afk]> well, so i guess i'll use Box2D
[8:17] <polan> you better pray you don't rage quit when first big problem occur.
[8:17] <asie[afk]> yes
[8:17] <asie[afk]> the first big problem will be either implementing in Box2D
[8:17] <asie[afk]> or multiplayer
[8:17] <polan> multiplayer might be harder ; p
[8:17] <asie[afk]> yes
[8:17] <asie[afk]> but the first one
[8:18] <asie[afk]> not the hardest one
[8:18] <asie[afk]> but i have some protocol concepts for multiplayer
[8:18] * Diablodoct0r is now known as Diablodoct0r|away
[8:18] <asie[afk]> i can probably do the client
[8:18] <asie[afk]> it's worse with the server
[8:18] <polan> if you will use tcp remember that sending not always mean = it's send

[8:18] <polan> ya
[8:18] <asie[afk]> TCP is slower but gets it all the time
[8:18] <asie[afk]> :P

[8:39] <Darkebrz> Merciless, the trick with cannons is that you have to drop the TNT into a stream of water
[8:39] <Dommys> What do you do with the zombie cage?
[8:39] <Chenny> hehe it was cool :D got some gunpowder :3
[8:39] <SireTRM> That thing will spawn zombies and there are special items in the chests of that room
[8:39] <Darkebrz> then it wont destroy anything but still damage and force
[8:39] <Merciless> oic
[8:39] <Chenny> i smashed it
[8:40] <Trapiki> oohh grats, I've been trying to find one of those :c

[8:42] <Chenny> man i can't rember the last time i saw daylight

[8:42] <Darkebrz> Maybe once in a blue moon
[8:42] <zeroZshadow> so i think i'll go play on easy today
[8:42] <Trapiki> I play on peaceful so I can build this http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/2205/47162582.jpg :D
[8:42] <Chenny> prehaps
[8:42] <SireTRM> I want customizable spawns, but I don't think that will happen.
[8:42] <Darkebrz> But very rarely do they come out of caves
[8:42] <Darkebrz> Because if they do they burn to death
[8:42] <blaster> Not creeprs
[8:42] <Darkebrz> SireTRM, it will
[8:42] <blaster> or spider
[8:42] <Skorchy> Welp that was beautiful.
[8:43] <Darkebrz> Creepers will stay
[8:43] <Darkebrz> Spiders are harmless during the day

[8:43] <zeroZshadow> when multiplayer is there, i'll be doing this with 3 friends of mine
[8:43] <blaster> Where there are no random monsters spawned in dark areas
[8:43] <blaster> BUT
[8:43] <zeroZshadow> non stop
[8:43] <Skorchy> Greece + Spartans = autowin.
[8:43] <blaster> there are dungeons

[8:45] <SireTRM> Depends.

[8:45] <SireTRM> Boats for oceans, mine carts for hills.
[8:45] <SireTRM> Going down hills, that is.
[8:45] <Darkebrz> C418, whopper
[8:45] <Hakaze> ugh
[8:45] <SoulSolace> How do I place flowers onto ground?
[8:45] <Hakaze> so i can't use a mine card for straight lines?
[8:45] <Darkebrz> right click
[8:46] <SireTRM> Probably boats for going up hills.
[8:46] <gear1> you can
[8:46] <SoulSolace> It doesen't work
[8:46] <gear1> but its not as fast
[8:46] <SireTRM> ^
[8:46] <Darkebrz> Minecarts are for the most part useless
[8:46] <Redshift> yes
[8:46] <Darkebrz> Only good in SMP if they can carry stuff
[8:46] <NMLittle> Until there is a way to power them.
[8:46] <gear1> i will settle for pig powered carts

[9:07] <Killazer> indeed
[9:07] <revenant> hey Fax, I was just telling people about how "Thomas" is notch's boyfriend.
[9:07] <revenant> I looked him up and his full name is Thomas "Lance" Marcelo.
[9:07] <Merciless> revenant is a troll or an idiot or both
[9:07] <SireTRM> Thomas is the honorary name of a dead sheep.
[9:07] <Faxanavia> revenant is a troll.
[9:07] <Fatalis> myes
[9:07] <SireTRM> Or any dead sheep, really.
[9:07] <Faxanavia> RIP Thomas.

[9:08] <Fatalis> just a random name?
[9:08] <revenant> That's where you're wrong.
[9:08] <Killazer> Sheep was named before Revenant born...
[9:08] <Faxanavia> itt revenant is a troll who likes it in the butt.
[9:08] <slowriot> ANYWAY
[9:08] <Fatalis> Notch didn't make the thomas thing
[9:08] <slowriot> come on
[9:08] <slowriot> let's poke notch
[9:08] <slowriot> and get him to bring the server back
[9:08] <revenant> The sheep was named after Notch's boyfriend THomas.
[9:08] <slowriot> i want to sword you all in the face

[9:09] <Rohedin> Oh lawd
[9:09] <Fatalis> a one day test
[9:09] <Fatalis> -_-
[9:09] <slowriot> it can be a one week test

[9:10] <Faxanavia> when notch is talking about releasing a test server
[9:10] <Fatalis> revenant, shut up, and get back under your bridge
[9:10] <Merciless> ez are you here
[9:10] <SireTRM> slowriot, I don't think Notch wants to spend the power to finish that.
[9:10] <Faxanavia> will he be releasing server software?
[9:10] <Iguana> Thomas is that sheep meme
[9:10] <SireTRM> Rohedin, jumping slimes.
[9:10] <Faxanavia> or opening a server
[9:10] <Fatalis> I don't think she is her
[9:10] <Iguana> Ain't he?
[9:10] <Fatalis> here

[9:10] <Fatalis> they all jump
[9:10] <Rohedin> Because I'm playing on peaceful right now
[9:10] <SireTRM> Rohedin, not all of them.
[9:10] <Rohedin> Ah
[9:11] <Fatalis> large ones are hostile
[9:11] <SireTRM> Well, beware. If you played that map recently, even on peaceful, it may have large slimes on it.

[9:14] <Bodie> i have 2 x 22" screens
[9:14] <Dommys> If you place a torch below a stone that is supporting a pile of sand/gravel.. and break the stone, when the sand/gravel hit the torch they "break" and become collectable.

[9:15] <Skorchy> I think I've found the largest naturally generated cave in minecraft ever 0.0
[9:15] <Kokopure> monitors aren't "mean to be" any specific way
[9:15] <Snowman> I ahve 2 monitors, my second on is primarily my IRC monitor
[9:15] <Kokopure> since Windows can flip them however you want
[9:15] <cardgame> how many torches would you use to light it, skorchy
[9:15] <Kokopure> they're "meant to be" however you need them to be.
[9:15] <Killazer> Skorchy, screenshot it
[9:15] <Sketchy> The portrait is mounted on an arm with a pivot so it's easy to make in landscape
[9:15] <Bodie> :P i'm just playing
[9:15] <Kokopure> if you want them portrait, they're "meant to be" portrait.

[9:18] <JamesK89> I'm not a big fan of floating islands
[9:18] <Kokopure> with the new water and lava...
[9:18] <JamesK89> But I like the obsidian idea
[9:18] <Kokopure> those could look effin' gorgeous
[9:18] <Skorchy> I might end up getting a hypercam and putting the size ofit on youtube.
[9:18] <Demki> Kokopure, you can find them on infdev if you are lucky.
[9:19] <Skorchy> Once I finish lighting it, if there is an end.
[9:19] <Hakaze> i wished there was a key that places a tile infront of your feet if theres something to attach it too
[9:19] <Kokopure> not the InDev kind
[9:19] <TehButter> Demki: but very small
[9:19] <Demki> well.
[9:19] <Demki> that's still something
[9:19] <JamesK89> If there was one thing I could change about Minecraft its the water physics

[9:20] <Kokopure> I think of Notch chooses to implement some "volume" in the future, that'd be cool
[9:20] <Skorchy> Fury I want starcraft II
[9:20] <TehButter> so the water is fine
[9:20] <Kokopure> but I don't "need it"
[9:20] <Kokopure> yes cardgame?
[9:20] <Skorchy> But the store is out :(
[9:20] <cardgame> try filling a bucket of water in a deep ocean
[9:20] <Kokopure> oh right
[9:20] <Milp10> Why did my items just vanish after i died?
[9:20] <Kokopure> yes.
[9:20] <cardgame> it create a HOLE in the ocean
[9:20] <Kokopure> that bug
[9:20] <Sketchy> does alpha survival have floating islands at all?
[9:20] <Kokopure> Notch does need to fix that bug
[9:20] <Milp10> Dont i drop my items when i die? mine are gone now

[9:21] <cardgame> whirlpools make me sad
[9:21] <Kokopure> if you grab water out of a water body more than one block deep, all currents flowing into that block will stay.

[9:22] <Milp10> What do i do with slimeballs?
[9:22] <Hakaze> you mean the mechanic that new water spring tiles only are created if the tile is on a natural material tile like stone or dirt?

[9:22] <TehButter> Nuu
[9:22] <Merciless> is anyone else in agreement that HoN and LoL (and dota in general) should appreciate the games they were made from more
[9:22] <TehButter> Throw them
[9:22] <Hakaze> it lets you create vortexes in the ocean thats pretty neat :P

[9:22] <Milp10> how
[9:22] <TehButter> im kidding
[9:22] <Milp10> :)
[9:22] <TehButter> ._.
[9:22] <SireTRM> Kokopure, just add or delete a block on the chunk to force it to update.
[9:22] <Milp10> lawl
[9:22] <Kokopure> SireTRM, I did, obviously
[9:22] <Kokopure> and it didn't work
[9:22] <cardgame> merciless, I don't know what LoL or HoN or DotA are.
[9:22] <SireTRM> Hmm, it works with farms. . .
[9:23] <Milp10> And why are all my items gone that i dropped 3 deaths ago? D:
[9:23] <Merciless> cardgame good
[9:23] <SireTRM> Milp10, item entities vanish after 5 minutes.
[9:23] <TehButter> Yar
[9:23] <cardgame> more like 10
[9:23] <TehButter> i think 10
[9:23] <TehButter> not sure though
[9:23] <TehButter> never counted
[9:23] <Sketchy> I'm just wondering how long it will take for a dota mode to get made in sc2
[9:23] <SireTRM> I dunno. Me either. . .
[9:23] <cardgame> 10 has been confirmed by independent studies
[9:23] <Merciless> it's already made
[9:23] <Merciless> along with TD
[9:24] <TehButter> Alrighty

[9:38] <KillingSpree_> cardgame how so
[9:38] <SireTRM> If I could have found a floating rock, NullAshton.
[9:38] <cardgame> you say the story of Thomas is tldr -.-
[9:39] <NullAshton> I have plenty of them
[9:39] <asiekierka> cardgame - yes
[9:39] <asiekierka> so
[9:39] <asiekierka> where was the code leaked
[9:39] <asiekierka> does anyone know at last
[9:39] <KillingSpree_> Tldr means too long did not read
[9:39] <cardgame> it was during a stream

[9:41] <Hakaze> sniff
[9:41] <KillingSpree_> to be*

[10:26] <Hyst> OMFG.
[10:26] <visiON> Why update java
[10:26] <Sanky> Yeah, I'm updating Java right now
[10:26] <gdude2002> cardgame: Cause it's more copmatible
[10:26] <visiON> java aint the problem

[10:26] <Hyst> Ive just found the fb f one of the people I used to have a huge crush on
[10:26] <Quatroking> cardgame, 32 bit comps aint the problem, there's plenty of those

[10:27] <TehButter> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv6RbEOlqRo&feature=player_embedded
[10:27] <Quatroking> its just that a lot of shitty OEM builders install 32-bit OS's
[10:27] <visiON> That's why you need to build a PC yourself
[10:27] <cardgame> yep
[10:27] <Quatroking> Long story short: don't buy a computer in a store
[10:27] <visiON> from scratch
[10:27] <Willox> I get mine custom made
[10:27] <visiON> Welding as shit like that

[10:45] <visiON> Yeah
[10:45] <visiON> XP has no problems
[10:45] <Kokopure> yeah :D?
[10:45] <Kokopure> I think that would be cool.
[10:45] <Link2006> AA: you dont need one ... www.twitter.com/xnotch
[10:45] <Mataata> I have a twitter, but I only use it for disqus
[10:45] <Link2006> just keep watching that
[10:45] <visiON> wasnt being sarcastic, really , XP has no problems
[10:45] <Wizeon> I just started playing today, and the first night was horrible, I didn't even finish the house so I just standed in a corner shaking all over
[10:45] <Kokopure> if maximum rendering distance was the minimum, EVERYTHING would be fog.
[10:45] <Link2006> i have one tho and use it somewhat widely
[10:45] <Mataata> Mine's heavyweapwnsguy
[10:45] <Kizzycocoa> change fog colour to blood red
[10:45] <Kokopure> and you would be walking, walking, walking
[10:46] <Kokopure> CREEPER
[10:46] <Kizzycocoa> even better
[10:46] <Kokopure> SLIME
[10:46] <Wizeon> and heard those creeps walk D:
[10:46] <Kokopure> it would be fantastic.
[10:46] <Nunuru> SMP server still down?
[10:46] <Kokopure> staying together with other players would be a must.
[10:46] <visiON> SMP is boring atm
[10:46] <Flamester> hmm
[10:46] <Flamester> Slime Creeper?
[10:46] <Nunuru> Is Notch codin still? :D
[10:46] <Mataata> Sleeper?
[10:46] <Mataata> Nahh
[10:46] <visiON> He is always coding
[10:46] <Flamester> Explosive slimes
[10:46] <cardgame> Notch codes in his dreams

[10:47] <Kizzycocoa> notch codes in his sleep and in his dreams :\/
[10:47] <Flamester> imagine it
[10:47] <Evil-Ville> CHUCK NORRIS JOKE HAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
[10:47] <Flamester> you have a huge slime
[10:47] <Flamester> you kill it
[10:47] <Flamester> it explodes like a creeper
[10:47] <Flamester> and makes 4 big slimes
[10:47] <Kokopure> actually, often when I have huge slimes, I kill them
[10:47] <Kokopure> aaand they just die
[10:47] <Flamester> they also exlopode
[10:47] <Azathoth> so chuck norris dies every weekend?
[10:47] <Kokopure> they don't split
[10:47] <Flamester> and each turns into 4 little slimes
[10:47] <Kokopure> I think Notch should make it so slimes always split upon death.
[10:47] <Flamester> and they also exlpode
[10:48] <Kokopure> otherwise why should I be afraid of big ones?
[10:48] <Kokopure> Flamester, that could be an alternate slime maybe
[10:48] <Kokopure> "red slime"
[10:48] <Mataata> I thought big slimes divded into four smaller ones
[10:48] <Kizzycocoa> yes. but each time, he splits to 4 smaller chuck's
[10:48] <cardgame> only if you don't kill them with a sword
[10:48] <Flamester> there are 3 slime sizes
[10:48] <Kokopure> Mataata, sometimes they do.
[10:48] <cardgame> if you slash them to death it's fine

[10:48] <Kokopure> Zombiguides, SMP server is getting DDoS'd into the ground.
[10:49] <Zombiguides> ok
[10:49] <Mataata> Meh, I moved and can't find any nearby mines
[10:49] <Flamester> hmm

[10:49] <Kizzycocoa> I thought it was shut down O.o
[10:49] <Flamester> Ill call it a cluster slime
[10:49] <AA> Probably /v/
[10:49] <Kokopure> it might be shut down, actually
[10:49] <Mataata> Might be, really
[10:49] <C418> probably shut down
[10:49] <Mataata> He left it up all night
[10:49] <C418> makes no sense to keep it alive

[10:51] <C418> I think there is an issue with the slimes though. if there are many, it gets horribly annoying

[10:52] <cardgame> It's a decent weapon but it DOES NOT FIT THE THEME at all
[10:52] <Cosmic_Fool> it disappoints me that the SMP code was linked
[10:52] <Kokopure> C418, you're the audio boss, right?
[10:52] <Kokopure> I'm sure Notch would listen to you if you suggested that
[10:52] <Cosmic_Fool> that is all I have to say to you

[10:52] <SmokestormX> You know what I have learned from playing minecraft
[10:52] <Kokopure> sort of a squeaky sound
[10:52] <SmokestormX> Its addictive.

[10:53] <Jordo76> The Molotov Cocktail is a joke
[10:53] <Kokopure> aww.
[10:53] <Mataata> I was expecting them to be more gloopy sounding
[10:53] <Kokopure> I thought a Molotov Cocktail would be cool.
[10:53] <C418> expectations can never be held up
[10:53] <Kizzycocoa> I think squelching would suit better, but that's just me :3
[10:53] <Azathoth> Link2006, there is no music
[10:53] <Jordo76> Maybe Notch will make a "Future" Addon

[11:07] <Ominus> In the radioactive wasteland of the future, Sam Hell is one of the last fertile men on the planet. A female organization intent on repopulating kidnaps Sam and sends him on a deadly mission to rescue -- and impregnate -- a group of beautiful women held captive by the violent bipedal amphibian leader of Frogtown. Will Sam and his "loaded weapon" survive the mission?
[11:07] <Milp_main> Kokopure weird, some now do, but most dont
[11:07] <Ominus> ROFL
[11:07] <Kokopure> Ominus, what the fuck is that
[11:07] <Ominus> a movie
[11:07] <Flamester> Also
[11:07] <Flamester> here is a real recipie
[11:07] <Flamester> 1.) In an open area, wearing a gas mask, mix 10 gms of glycerine with 2 gm of sodium bisulfate in the 300 ml erlenmeyer flask.
[11:07] <Ominus> called Hell Comes to Frogtown
[11:07] <Flamester> 2.) Light the alcohol burner, and gently heat the flask.
[11:07] <Flamester> 3.) The mixture will begin to bubble and froth; these bubbles are tear gas.
[11:07] <Flamester> 4.) When the mixture being heated ceases to froth and generate gas, or a brown residue becomes visible in the tube, the reaction is complete. Remove the heat source, and dispose of the heated mixture, as it is corrosive.
[11:07] <Flamester> 5.) The material that condenses in the condenser and drips into the collectin flask is tear gas. It must be capped tightly, and stored in a safe place.

[12:07] <pontusedberg> !!Creeper!! says "almost"
[12:08] <Expandedcelt> I'm making an obsidian house come SMP
[12:08] <Kokopure> NullAshton, in order for your house to be griefproof, it's going to have to be suspended in midair and covered in lava.
[12:08] * WateryHell (Mibbit@cpe-098-024-193-223.nc.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[12:08] <frazier6567> ima use lots of lava and purple
[12:08] <NullAshton> kokopure: Or made out of obsidian.
[12:08] <NullAshton> It is fairly incredibly impossible to 'grief' obsidian houses.
[12:08] <coladash> no, diamond can still mine it
[12:08] <frazier6567> yah... two layeras of obsidian.. or one of adminium
[12:08] <Kokopure> yes, but it takes a while
[12:08] <NullAshton> Yes, and it takes about five minutes to mine one piece with a diamond pick.
[12:08] <coladash> Failed to connect to the server
[12:08] <Kokopure> anyway, NullAshton
[12:09] <coladash> Connection timed out: connect
[12:09] <Kokopure> you have to think like a griefer to beat a griefer -__-

[12:09] <blaster> word

[12:09] <Kokopure> indeed.
[12:09] <polan> there must be some way in ;)
[12:09] <Miclee> colon was probably a test password to see if the 'connect' button worked.
[12:09] <Kokopure> and fill the inside with lava.
[12:09] <Expandedcelt> Do you guys know the infinate lava source trick? Makes making obsidian houses alot easier
[12:09] <NullAshton> Kokopure: I would get bored, and burn down the wooden house next to it.
[12:09] <polan> or
[12:09] <frazier6567> bring in the TnT
[12:09] <Lantris> Kokopure
[12:09] <Lantris> Break down front door
[12:09] <polan> you can wall them inside with obisidian ^^
[12:09] <Lantris> Dig under
[12:09] <Kokopure> there you go, Lantris
[12:10] <Firetempest> can you hurt each other yet? until you can hurt each other and kill or be killed by grifers, i dont care about smp
[12:10] <Kokopure> NullAshton, how are you getting into your griefproof house?
[12:10] <Fiskie> I tested griefing already and it works
[12:10] <Expandedcelt> lantris, what if the floor and hidden access tunnel were obsidian?
[12:10] <NullAshton> Probably an iron door with a password type padlock.
[12:10] <Miclee> Fiskie, you weren't the first.
[12:10] <Lantris> Break down door
[12:10] <Kokopure> NullAshton
[12:10] <Fiskie> However water physics don't work in mp properly afaik
[12:10] <Kokopure> "password"
[12:10] <polan> and replace with 2 obsidian blocks ;d
[12:10] <Aexis_Rai> Iron Door = breakable
[12:10] <Kokopure> it's much easier to take a pickaxe to your door.
[12:10] <Kokopure> and they will.
[12:10] <NullAshton> I'm not too sure how tough iron picks are.

[12:22] <TheCactusman> Why firetempest?
[12:22] <Gio3505> and he said they were hard to do or something
[12:22] <Stoup> Actually, if ladders could be placed independently of blocks, they WOULD be fences

[12:50] <Evil-Ville> they got a high paying job -> they deserve the money -> because they have a high paying job
[12:50] <Cheeseyx> So they don't deserve the huge profits
[12:51] <Evil-Ville> very good reasoning
[12:51] <EmpiresBane> Cheeseyx, that's the point
[12:51] <EmpiresBane> the companies that can't do finances fail
[12:51] <pontusedberg> i saw it on TV news, "scientist thinks that the meaning of life is already an answer, and now what we all have bee waiting for, pr0n"
[12:51] <Cheeseyx> The point is they don't fail
[12:51] <Cheeseyx> Not once they get big
[12:51] <EmpiresBane> because the govt. interfered

[13:04] <B45h_V|> I got a bug with minecraft
[13:04] <Lapsus> Flamester: We're not clicking your referral link
[13:04] <Quatroking> so I throw the car into the LHC and run off
[13:04] <Quatroking> Okay
[13:04] <Lantris> The company loses profit because you didn't pay for it
[13:04] <Fatalis> eh?
[13:04] <Quatroking> Now, is my neighbour missing anything?
[13:04] <Miclee> Lantris, they don't lose profit.
[13:04] <brorave> Quatroking: hey you
[13:04] <Cheeseyx> No
[13:04] <brorave> that doesn't work
[13:04] <Miclee> You weren't going to buy it either way.
[13:04] <brorave> closed circuit
[13:04] <brorave> :(
[13:04] <EmpiresBane> the thing is, many people would buyt something if they couldn't pirate it
[13:04] <Quatroking> brorave, :(
[13:04] <Lantris> Yes but you steal it from them still
[13:04] <brorave> to place to put it in
[13:04] <Lantris> You should be paying $50 for it
[13:05] <Lantris> But instead you steal it
[13:05] <Cheeseyx> But a lot of games are really over-priced, too
[13:05] <brorave> NO SEXUAL INNENDO INTENDED
[13:05] <Quatroking> I'm glad I pirated a few games
[13:05] <Miclee> Lantris, they don't lose any money.
[13:05] <EmpiresBane> especially wii games
[13:05] <Miclee> You're downloading a copy of it.
[13:05] <EmpiresBane> whaty pieces of shit
[13:05] <EmpiresBane> disappointing
[13:05] <Miclee> You wouldn't be buying it either way.
[13:05] <Evil-Ville> EmpiresBane more people buy games now than ever before, yet there's more piracy now than ever before
[13:05] <Fatalis> MH is awesome for the Wii
[13:05] <Cheeseyx> And then there is the issue of retaining the thing
[13:05] <Lantris> Even if you had no interest in buying the game and you download it they lose your $50
[13:05] <B45h_V|> minecraft client is freezing after several seconds. If I start it with java -jar, it prints lines like this: "There's no such entity to remove: dq@3ecec78d @ -24, 0"

[13:05] <Miclee> Lantris, it's still not a profit loss.
[13:05] <B45h_V|> I then have to force-close the client
[13:05] <Quatroking> there's this game called Sword of the stars
[13:05] <Miclee> The profit was not there to begin.
[13:05] <EmpiresBane> corralation does not indicate causality
[13:06] <Cheeseyx> If you buy a song on iTunes, and iTunes dissapears off the face of the planet, you no longer own a copy of the song
[13:06] <Cheeseyx> If you pirate it, it is yours forever
[13:06] <Lantris> The profit was lost that you didn't buy a real copy but pirated i
[13:06] <Dragoon> Oh FFS
[13:06] <Quatroking> I playedi t for about 5 minutes then I was like "Even minesweeper is more entertaining" and I killed it

[13:06] <Evil-Ville> Lantris how do you explain the fact that many people buy stuff they've pirated earlier and ended up liking
[13:06] <brorave> because I do
[13:06] <Quatroking> brorave no
[13:06] <Quatroking> I don't even play it
[13:06] <Lantris> They still stole a copy of the game
[13:06] <brorave> pfffff
[13:06] * EmpiresBane is away: learning Perl.
[13:06] <Miclee> The profit was not there to begin, Lantris.
[13:06] <Lantris> Yes they bought a normal copy
[13:07] <Lantris> but they still stole another copy
[13:07] <Evil-Ville> Stop calling it stealing, it's flat out wrong
[13:07] <Cheeseyx> And you get charged less for stealing an actual CD than pirating it
[13:07] <Dragoon> Why are you guys talking about pirating/politics?
[13:08] <Cheeseyx> When you cause more profit loss for stealing the CD
[13:08] <Lantris> Lol
[13:08] <Lantris> I don't really know
[13:08] <Miclee> The profit was not there to begin, Lantris.

[13:08] <Cheeseyx> Take this scenario: I am not going to buy a game

[13:08] <Miclee> The copy itself never existed, as it's cracked.
[13:08] <Cheeseyx> If I pirate it, I play it
[13:08] <Cheeseyx> If not, I don't buy it

[17:08] <DOOMKID> yea but i cant use the iron to get the diamond can i?
[17:08] <Rehevkor> yes

[18:16] <Traviskolber> So I would have suffered it through which I did.

[18:17] <MikkoK> sun is rising in finland
[18:17] <Traviskolber> Like, after a lot of milk I'll puke.
[18:17] <Scripp> Yesterday?
[18:17] <viperfan7> I know what you mean, same done for me with my mold alergies, except they did my arm
[18:17] <Traviskolber> But I can drink a bit.
[18:17] <ZarroTsu> I'm going to assume "No new online hosting for a few days while Notch fixes most bugs"
[18:17] <Scripp> What ever day it was in sweden.
[18:17] <MikkoK> i dont just like milk
[18:17] <Quatroking> I once did a bet with half my class that I would drink a glass of milk, despite my lactose introllerancy
[18:18] <Rooster> Scripp: I love these two word suggestions! :D Bee hives. Yes. I must do that.about 7 hours ago
[18:18] <Quatroking> earned me 50 euros
[18:18] <Scripp> ffff
[18:18] <Sr_creeper> Do you see what i mean quatro, i think i can officially call it a phobia.

[18:18] <benjgvps> Sr_creeper: Are you the fuck who leaves his christmas lights up?
[18:18] <Sr_creeper> HOLY FUCK NO

[18:19] <ZarroTsu> but yeah, I wonder if the next time SMP is hosted, there'll be multiple servers
[18:19] <DimJim> i think the reason he leaves his xmas lights up is because there's a wasp nest on them
[18:19] <viperfan7> lol
[18:19] <benjgvps> haha
[18:19] <Sr_creeper> benjgvps, i leave them up, because its easier to than to hassle around the twisting trees, when they're hardly noticable as they are.
[18:19] <ZarroTsu> then again, even at 100 users it'd fill up far too quickly
[18:19] <MikkoK> i have about 200 flys in this house...
[18:19] <Quatroking> just get an electric bug zapper
[18:19] <viperfan7> meh, nothing a bit of fire cant solve :D
[18:19] <Skillkills> Get some fucking wasp spray
[18:19] <benjgvps> Fire isn't fun
[18:19] <Sr_creeper> I'd rather buy a can of raid to kill the nest.
[18:19] <Quatroking> zapping bugs is awesome
[18:19] <viperfan7> agreed
[18:19] <benjgvps> You need to build your own taser out of an array of disposable cameras

[18:20] <muddtusk_> benjgvps, that don't really work
[18:20] <Skillkills> Yes it does mudd
[18:20] <viperfan7> hey, coil guns are easy to make
[18:20] <Skillkills> Lmao
[18:20] <benjgvps> Get enough and create an arc
[18:20] <muddtusk_> +1 for railgun
[18:20] <MikkoK> i would build a tnt cannon in minecraft style
[18:20] <MikkoK> :D
[18:20] <Sr_creeper> You guys are fucked up, all this to kill a wasp nest? When i can go down to the supermarket and buy a can of raid?
[18:20] <benjgvps> How fun is that?
[18:20] <benjgvps> That isn't even manly
[18:20] <Skillkills> Guize
[18:20] <MikkoK> then just punch a little wood and repair my house
[18:20] <Skillkills> Taser = raid
[18:20] <muddtusk_> nope, discharging a capacitor is not the same as a taser
[18:20] <Skillkills> taser + raid*

[18:21] <Skillkills> No but it works like one
[18:21] <Quatroking> they're legal, cost you 5 bucks, and are fun

[18:21] <Lisimba> I saw a laser system that could aim at positions in thin air and make little explosions there. They used it to make pixel art. If you fit it with a detector and targeting system you could set it up near the nest and blow up every wasp that passes by.
[18:21] <Gflo> wipe out all wasps within a 100 square mile radius
[18:21] <Quatroking> did you know that zapping earwigs makes them smell like caramel?
[18:21] <viperfan7> well, you can always use the cleaning power of ammonium and bleach :P
[18:21] <Quatroking> shit is wack
[18:21] <Skillkills> Ballon + dry ice + hot water..... nail that up right under the wasp nest
[18:21] <viperfan7> please dont do that though
[18:22] <MikkoK> WTF WTF WTF
[18:22] <viperfan7> because mustard gas is not fun

[18:22] <Quatroking> MikkoK, you dug through the world
[18:22] <Sr_creeper> THat picture is relevant
[18:22] <Vicrry> best idea! Set off a thermite reaction just above the nest
[18:22] <viperfan7> its the light
[18:22] <Gflo> shoot wasps with a nerf dart
[18:22] <viperfan7> dont go into the light
[18:22] <benjgvps> Sr_creeper: Hahaha
[18:22] <Quatroking> yay KC green
[18:22] <MikkoK> im going to the light because its in my tunnel
[18:22] <benjgvps> Oh my god, puppy linux is a bitch to install
[18:22] <MikkoK> did get screenshot
[18:22] <viperfan7> hey, anyone think that it would be a good idea to make a tool that converts dwarf fortress maps into minecraft maps?
[18:23] <Quatroking> benjgvps, its a rather annoying process, yes
[18:23] <benjgvps> Every time I try ubuntu again, the isntaller is better. The installer is the same as it was three years ago
[18:23] <Kokopure> anyone know if the SMP server is up for tonight?
[18:23] <Quatroking> also make sure to make a sessionfile once you're turning the pc off

[19:06] <MikkoK> my typo in forums
[19:07] <MikkoK> :D
[19:07] <ConflagratedCanine> Minecraft requires alchohol
[19:07] <bleak> mrstone: you could make a hollow 9x9 pipe out of anything though
[19:07] <bleak> and, there are no pumps!
[19:07] <ConflagratedCanine> Here's a two letter suggestion: Drunk Driving
[19:07] <Firetempest> needs towercaps for alchohol
[19:07] <ConflagratedCanine> Pop a few beers and get on a pig.
[19:07] <mrstone> That's why I mean, make a pump to go with the pipes!
[19:07] <ConflagratedCanine> Enjoy that double entendre.
[19:08] <GreenHoopla> I'll take 5 shots of jack and sit in a minecart any day
[19:08] <bleak> If you put a pipe directly on a spring square, would it kill the spring?

[19:16] <Gio3505> oh, thats because they were there before, happened to me too
[19:16] <ConflagratedCanine> Are you holding a sword when you make your modest request?
[19:16] <ConflagratedCanine> Do you shout?
[19:16] <bleak> alright so... how far down to I have to be to find iron? Is it below sea level? Cuz I'm pretty sure the lake I spawn next to is at sea level, it's got a beach and stuff...

[19:19] <ConflagratedCanine> Minecraft needs caveins.
[19:19] <ConflagratedCanine> Or at least more gravel to help simulate it.
[19:19] <bleak> Mainly because I've found spelunking to be a great way to die after getting lost and lose the 150 iron and 15 diamonds you've foudn on that trip.
[19:19] <Supa> yeah that's the opposite of true
[19:19] <RavenBurga> 150 iron isn't that good
[19:19] <LG_Legacy> Also
[19:20] <LG_Legacy> Guys be careful when you repeatedly spam something, or else you will end up like Budda

[19:20] <bleak> RavenBurga: So how do you not run out of food, not get lost, etc.?
[19:20] <Evil-Ville> was it private messages or something?
[19:20] <RavenBurga> 4chan probably
[19:21] <RavenBurga> Bleak just dig to surface
[19:21] <LG_Legacy> Evil-Ville One moment
[19:21] <bleak> mmm
[19:21] <ConflagratedCanine> I like how being part of 4chan is a requirement to be an asshole on the internet.
[19:21] <Supa> do you need food to survive?
[19:21] <bleak> ConflagratedCanine: It's not a requirement, but it helps
[19:22] <RavenBurga> Booby
[19:22] <ConflagratedCanine> Nice to have a large chunk of people to blame it on, heh.
[19:22] <RavenBurga> Yeah lol
[19:22] <Diablodoct0r> I really think practicising bans for autorejoin is pointless
[19:22] <Diablodoct0r> Everyone has it
[19:22] <RavenBurga> If somehow really bad happens on interwebs, blame 4chan
[19:22] <ConflagratedCanine> Despite 4chan being a bunch of normal people who are really just expressing what they're too polite to do in public.
[19:22] <bleak> I agree with that rule actually. autojoin options make kicking people rather pointless
[19:23] <ConflagratedCanine> In a sense, blaming 4chan is pretty much blaming humanity.
[19:23] <Diablodoct0r> The kick itself serves as a warning

[19:45] <jprogram> one scenario: ocean water vs pond
[19:45] <GreyMario> Stupid Minecraft Classic.
[19:45] <MikkoK> play alpha!
[19:45] <GreyMario> Going to buy it for me?

[19:46] <GreyMario> Yup, grass dies.
[19:46] <MikkoK> notch should make indev testable for free users
[19:46] <jprogram> so, in the middle of the dugout, there's some dent of water
[19:47] <MikkoK> it would make lot more buyers :P

[20:14] <Cheeseyx> Flint arrows for fire arrows
[20:14] <GARY_M_9> then set it on fire with a flint/steel
[20:14] <BlueProtoman> We need horses!
[20:14] <Conundrumer> i just got my cannon to blast through 8 layers of stone in one shot
[20:14] <Fisheatsbear> we could be cowboys :D

[20:15] <Fisheatsbear> so less of them
[20:15] <Cheeseyx> Ooh, that would work

[20:16] <BlueProtoman> Ah.
[20:16] <GARY_M_9> <Cheeseyx> Still, a medium range weapon that is innacurate but powerful would be nice <-- or a more accurate bow that actually shoots in your crosshairs

[20:22] <Deathrogue54> missile*
[20:22] <Deages> but guns and magic would be cool
[20:22] <Deathrogue54> i think...
[20:22] <Cheeseyx> Moltov Cocktails, or other fire weapons would be nice
[20:22] <Deages> it's a fantasy game anyway
[20:22] <Cheeseyx> I want a few kinds of magic:
[20:22] <Conundrumer> it's notch's game
[20:22] <Cheeseyx> Enchantments
[20:22] <Expandedcelt> Cheese they would be good for nothing but trolling
[20:22] <Cheeseyx> No
[20:22] <Deages> lolololol
[20:22] <Cheeseyx> They would be expensive
[20:22] <Deages> you guys are too easy
[20:23] <Conundrumer> moltoc cocktails PLEASE

[20:23] <Cheeseyx> So enchantments, passive magic, and non-combat magic
[20:23] <Deages> cuz he is wun
[20:23] <GMP> teleporter platforms would be nice
[20:23] <Deages> u guys r so butthurt @ gunz
[20:23] <Deathrogue54> i think that is what might happen cheeseyx
[20:23] <Skorchy> Magic and guns would be bullcrap.
[20:23] <Cheeseyx> Passive being a spell to push the opponent, or a shield, or slowing the opponent
[20:23] <Skorchy> I would stop playing.
[20:23] <Deages> why
[20:24] <Deages> cause you can't aim
[20:24] <Deages> rofl
[20:24] <Firetempest> magic AND guns? how about magic guns
[20:24] <Deages> how about guns that shoot magic
[20:24] * BlueProtoman (Mibbit@ool-182d4e17.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #minecraft
[20:24] <Deages> or a magic spell that spawns and fires guns !
[20:24] <Cheeseyx> Non-combat being traps and things
[20:24] <Deathrogue54> higher jumping and slow fall magic would be cool
[20:24] <Skorchy> I came to minecraft to mess around and have fun, not deal with a bunch of fags shooting at me and casting flare blinding my ass.
[20:24] <bleak> I really just want to see like, something that you can apply to your tools so they last longer, or maybe something you can put in while crafting for the same thing. Like craft an iron pickaxe with 3 coal as well and you get a steel pick which lasts longer!
[20:24] <Evil-Ville> well magic is going to be in the game in some form so better stop playing already

[20:45] <GreyMario> One of these biomes may contain an aquifer while another doesn't
[20:45] <Scripp> I know this.
[20:46] <GreyMario> And if you embark while the biome without the aquifer is selected (a bitch if it's the first one and you don't care about biomes)
[20:46] <GreyMario> you won't get warned

[22:15] <Fisheatsbear> ^^ old version
[22:15] <t3h_d00d> yeah i know
[22:15] <Norphax> i bought the game and my keyboard did not work :)
[22:15] <Norphax> was pretty frustrating i tell you
[22:15] <So_Useless> I bought it, then my brother got jealous and I bought it for him.
[22:16] <t3h_d00d> when i have no fog on a huge map i get like 3 fps though

[22:17] <Norphax> i know lol
[22:17] <Rikachu> They dont want me to gift it to them.

[22:36] <Expandedcelt> Crafting table - picks - torches - shack to stay in - urrthang else
[22:36] <Rikachu> All I do is mine...
[22:36] <Rikachu> I have too much iron.
[22:36] <TheDoleKing> Did you go for a 3 hour trip
[22:37] <Rikachu> Its ridiculous.
[22:37] <Fisheatsbear> i make a house where i spawn
[22:37] <Ernimtir> send me some! :P
[22:37] <Zaneo> i like to stay above ground when possible
[22:37] <So_Useless> So, who didn't know that you can push your boat and then jump in rather than slowly accelerating?
[22:37] <Expandedcelt> not wanting to lose my items, I stayed on the island and harvested shrubberies from the one tree on it
[22:37] <So_Useless> Because, I had no idea until a few hours ago.
[22:37] <Expandedcelt> and then I played the waiting game.
[22:37] <Fisheatsbear> lol shrubberies
[22:37] <Rikachu> I actually have pretty much no coal Ernimitir.
[22:37] <Ernimtir> so you went afk and had lunch while trees grew?
[22:38] <Rikachu> If you give me twice as much coal i would givve you iron.
[22:38] <Rikachu> gave*
[22:38] <Ernimtir> funny, I usually end up a chest worth of coal :P too much time on the surface I guess
[22:38] <So_Useless> Rikachu, that would be an awesome trade for me. Coal everywhere.
[22:38] <Expandedcelt> Nope, I mined. I had no torches on me either, and even on my island I did not feel safe from the creeper scourge

[22:39] <Rikachu> alpha.
[22:39] <Ernimtir> well, I don't actually have any coal yet on this world, I do have 11 stacks of clay brick though
[22:39] <Skorchy> I'm still wondering how much TNT it takes to delete the whole entire map.
[22:39] <TheDoleKing> Yes
[22:39] <TheDoleKing> Alpha
[22:39] <Rikachu> how did you find that much clay?
[22:40] <Rikachu> Ive only found some...
[22:40] <Ernimtir> sailed around the entire island
[22:40] <So_Useless> So, who hopes for pigbreeding? I want to capture pigs and then have endless meat.
[22:40] <Rikachu> the entire map is 9 times the size of earth.
[22:40] <Rikachu> I thought...
[22:40] <Ernimtir> not the map
[22:40] <Ernimtir> the island
[22:40] <Fisheatsbear> it takes an infinite amount of tnt to delete the map
[22:40] <Ernimtir> a islan I should say
[22:40] <TheDoleKing> I make Reed Fields
[22:40] <Fisheatsbear> depends on how big an island
[22:40] <BipolarWafflez> so if we have pig breeding do they get to fuck in sight of the player :D
[22:40] <Rikachu> Minecraft needs a proper trading system.
[22:41] <Ernimtir> I'm going with no WaffleZ
[22:41] <Fisheatsbear> ...
[22:41] <Rikachu> Once MP is released.
[22:41] <BipolarWafflez> modding in animal fucking :D
[22:41] <Rikachu> Pigs dont fuck.
[22:41] <So_Useless> I imagine they look at each other, then shake violently without touching, then a bunch of piglets spawn.
[22:41] <Rikachu> ...Only cows.
[22:41] <Norphax> this is why we can't have nice things
[22:41] <Rikachu> Maybe some sheep.

[23:02] <Rooster> Zombies are 2x as scary because of the noises.
[23:02] <FlamingTROUT> The glowing red eyes are... haunting.
[23:02] <Rikachu> Yeah exactly.
[23:02] <Rikachu> Skeletons would come next after spider though in terms of scariness.
[23:02] <Rooster> By far the scariest mob. Skeletons take a close second, because of their arrows.
[23:02] <Rikachu> Oh and skeletons also aimbot.
[23:02] <Rikachu> I swear they do.
