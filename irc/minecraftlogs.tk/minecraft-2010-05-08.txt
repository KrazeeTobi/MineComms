[5:04] * Annihilator (Annihilato@bas2-toronto48-1279609551.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
[5:04] <vurtual> A light that's lighting the area(very bad for a map if you overdo it, not good for size, won't look great)
[5:04] <Flesh> i think i worked it out actually
[5:04] <vurtual> or just like, a sprite?
[5:04] <Malikat> noooo i must go to target.
[5:04] <vurtual> dorf fortress in the shower
[5:04] <Malikat> i'll play dorf fortress when i return
[5:04] <vurtual> yes!
[5:04] <vurtual> To a hotel room!
[5:04] <Flesh> it was a hallway with emergency lighting leading to an exit
[5:04] <Malikat> and stream it maybe if anyone is interested
[5:05] <vurtual> flesh, just be sure to not overdo the lighting turn-on
[5:05] <Scirppy> I am
[5:05] <vurtual> too many unique-named lights in an area=baad.

[5:05] <vurtual> Also, use delays
[5:05] <Flesh> yeah it's a pretty slow strobe
[5:05] <Scirppy> And will enjoy it a great deal.
[5:05] <Malikat> well, you shall have you stream in an hour or two
[5:05] <Malikat> probably about 90 minutes from now
[5:05] <vurtual> so OUTPUT light1 delay 0.20
[5:05] <Flesh> thanks for the advice
[5:05] <vurtual> so OUTPUT light2 delay 0.40 and so on

[5:27] <vurtual> I made two sets of 6 of them on my fridge-hovercar
[5:27] <vurtual> it's like twin automatic laser shotguns firing railguns.

[5:28] <Shcaap> thats more awesome that a machine gun that fires flamethrowers

[5:30] <vurtual> blast
[5:30] <vurtual> like a quake 2 railgun
[5:30] <vurtual> except the beams fired rapidly, in a shotgun pattern
[5:30] <vurtual> and there's 6 barrels
[5:30] <vurtual> and you have two of them
[5:30] <vurtual> so it's like a minigun 6-barreled shotgun that fires railgun rails.
[5:32] <Shcaap> that sounds less awesome
[5:32] <Shcaap> the shotgun firing the actual railgun weapon itself is cooler
[5:32] <Firetempest> I want a gun that shoots tanks that in turn shoorts nukes

[7:30] <Hunter712> pretty coo
[7:31] <vede> People whose sole purpose is to occasionally inject links into the channel of random interest... I appreciate those people.
[7:31] <Malikat> dude, nice
[7:31] <Malikat> did you plane those flat parts?
[7:31] <vede> That's probably natural.

[7:32] <vurtual> okay, dONE WITH ALL THE PICTURES
[7:32] <Hunter712> that entire thing is natural
[7:32] <vurtual> jaw hurts kinda
[7:32] <Hunter712> infdev creator just made it for me
[7:32] <TrueWolves> ...
[7:32] <TrueWolves> That...
[7:32] <TrueWolves> That map is epic^Win
[7:32] <Shadaez> really cool
[7:33] <vede> So I just thought of something about all those people being like "OMFG I FOUND SOMEONE ELSES CRAP IN INFDEV"
[7:33] <Shadaez> looks like it messed up though
[7:33] <vurtual> my jaw is really uncomfortable for singing quietly like an hour straight.
[7:33] <Shadaez> add me on steam
[7:33] <vede> What if Notch actually only generated one big map, and made it so infdev loads it, so later (this is the primary reason for his vacation right now), he can say "Oh yeah. You were all playing on the same map." to illustrate how goddamn big it is.
[7:33] <vurtual> why did I do that!?
[7:34] <vurtual> vede, I really wish he did
[7:34] <vurtual> What if we bumped into eachother!?
[7:34] <vurtual> quickly spam unnatural blocks while running
[7:34] <Shadaez> i doubt the ocllective peopel playing infdev have explored 1/8th of it

[7:34] <Malikat> in a way, we are all playing the same gigantic map
[7:35] <Malikat> because the chunks are all based on the same psuedo-random algorithms

[7:35] <Malikat> not quite oceans yet
[7:35] <vede> Because there's some pretty decently-sized lakes, but nothing ocean-like.
[7:35] <Shadaez> i hope he adds really large ones
[7:36] <Shadaez> great lake sized
[7:36] <Shadaez> at least
[7:36] <Malikat> probably
[7:36] <vede> Yeah.

[7:41] <Flesh> research needs to be done
[7:41] <Vis{err}> They wouldn't delay like common
[7:41] <Vis{err}> you would be ass raped BEFORE you got out of the saferoom
[7:42] <Flesh> well i dont mean replace every single common with a hunter
[7:42] <vede> I occasionally like to try things that are just crazy insanely difficult.
[7:42] <vurtual> how about make them nerfed hunters
[7:42] <Flesh> i'd have to learn about their AI
[7:43] <vurtual> flesh, they are the night
[7:43] <vurtual> there is no
[7:43] <Vis{err}> vede: Realism expert?
[7:43] <vurtual> AI

[7:43] <Firetempest> JC2 is so much better then gta for my sense of mayhem. other then gmod, where else cane you tether a guy to a propane tank and launch him into the sky
[7:43] <vurtual> Then again there's a very blurry line between "really bad weather" and "really light tornado"
[7:43] <vurtual> Firetempest, or fly with propane tanks

[7:56] <DimJim> in fact center the entire thing around fry me to the moon, stranded, one stronghold mission, into the den and a just cause and you've got a great movie
[7:56] <vurtual> With multiple TYPES of CGI
[7:56] <Shadaez> streaming Unity
[7:56] <vurtual> So it's like there's cutscenes
[7:56] <Shadaez> livestream.com/Shadaez I think
[7:56] <vurtual> Where it's a cutscene like event, it looks more like 007: nightfire in saturation, or more real
[7:56] <vurtual> or what's needed
[7:57] <DimJim> i like how at the beginning the game just said "okay we're just going to get the cliches out of the way" and the black guy gets shot
[7:57] <vurtual> and then anything actiony/misc is more game-like
[7:57] <DimJim> also doing into the den with the reapers was kind of disappointing
[7:57] <DimJim> i would have loved to see bolo murdering everything with that machete
[7:58] <vurtual> in the stranded mission, rico should be in a plane, just seeing it short out, it's exploding, he's just all calmly trying to open the hatch, kicks the windshield off the top, places C4, backflips out, and blowsi t up

[8:09] <LuciferZ> I would prefer them to be NPCs with bows and arrows though.

[8:09] <LuciferZ> Something to guard my shit would be nice, yes
[8:10] <vede> LuciferZ, then you'd have the problem of people expecting too much out of them.
[8:10] <LuciferZ> Not if they're like, golems or something
[8:10] <LuciferZ> Which I guess fits under constructable
[8:10] <vede> But with just a stationary defense mechanism, you would never have to deal with the problem of places going entirely unprotected because no one wants to be a guard.
[8:10] <vede> Because being a guard would be *boring as fuck*.
[8:10] <Firetempest> id have a chest guarded like fort knox and only have a feather in it

[8:11] <Malikat> i've decided to say fuck it to this fortress
[8:11] <vurtual> fast travel and everything
[8:11] <Firetempest> like starcraft guns and flame turrets popping out of the floor
[8:11] <vurtual> okay did you flood the world with magma Malikat
[8:11] <vede> I'm imagining a mine with people in it, with a small fortress out in the front entrance. Normally, the entrance would be wide-open because everyone would be inside doing interesting things like mining and channeling, with no one guarding, so the place could just be ransacked and everyone would die.
[8:11] <Malikat> i put a hole in the reservoir and now i'm pumping water into the base
[8:12] <vurtual> total annihilation has better pop-out turrets
[8:12] <vurtual> anyways while you are all fascinating sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
[8:12] <vede> But with auto-turrets (of some sort), potential attackers actually have something to overcome before they slaughter everyone.
[8:12] <vede> And possibly alert a few people close to the entrance of an attack.
[8:12] <Malikat> while i flood my fortress
[8:12] <Malikat> everyone is dying of thirst
[8:12] <vurtual> omg steam fixed not being able to run on windows 2000
[8:12] <Malikat> isn't it ironic?
[8:13] <vede> vurtual, wow, now four more people can run Steam!
[8:13] <Firetempest> heh
[8:13] <vurtual> a few hundred actually
[8:13] <vede> Meh.
[8:13] <vede> Still insignificant.
[8:13] <vurtual> aka a few thousand dollars
[8:14] <vurtual> each buys 10 dollars in games
[8:14] <vurtual> a few thousand dollars
[8:14] <vede> Meh.
[8:14] <vurtual> one patch
[8:14] <vede> Still insignificant.
[8:14] <vurtual> oh hey I'll just do this one patch then
[8:14] <vurtual> and take the profits for myself

[8:14] <vurtual> anyone who uses win 2000 ever, I get all the profits generated by them.
[8:14] <vede> If them making a couple extra thousand bucks off Windows 2000, then they've got their priorities fucked to pieces.
[8:15] <vede> vurtual, a few thousand dollars is quite a bit to you.
[8:15] <vede> To Valve, it'd probably be gone in a week.
[8:15] <vede> ...
[8:15] <vurtual> Valve's still a small handful of people
[8:15] <vurtual> Sure, they're bigger now
[8:16] <Firetempest> http://zebragirl.keenspot.com/comics/ze20100506.jpg
[8:16] <vede> *bucks off Windows 2000 is significant
[8:16] <vurtual> But still, a few thousand dollars to them is still a lot for one patch
[8:16] <vede> vurtual, then like I said, priorities -> fucked to shit
[8:16] <vurtual> OH HEY IT APPEARS WIN 2000 ISN'T PROPERLY SUPPORTED FOR SOME THING. LET'S CHANGE THAT
[8:16] <vurtual> DONE
[8:17] <vede> I mean, if it was just like "Oh damn this Win 2000 bit is missing a semicolon" then why not.
[8:17] <vede> But if they were like "We're working hard to bring this platform to the Windows 2000 users out there." then it's dumb.
[8:18] <Shadaez> it was probably a tiny bug with 2000 that wasn't a hard fix
[8:18] <vurtual> steam always supported win 2000 normally
[8:18] <vede> Linux support for Steam/Source Engine is a nuhsessuhtee
[8:18] <vurtual> also remember how MW2 peaked over counter-strike in players? That's going down now
[8:19] <vurtual> linux steam is beign closer and closer
[8:19] <vurtual> there's hints about it constnatly, and there's mac steam
[8:19] <vede> I know, man, I'm so excited.
[8:19] <vurtual> well I don't have a mac and wine works so far for the two times I run games on my laptop
[8:19] <vurtual> windows 2003 64 bit is 0.42% of steam users
[8:20] <eritz> wine is for frenchmen

[8:20] <vurtual> and there's like hundreds of thousands
[8:20] <vurtual> so that's alot of users
[8:21] <vurtual> 5.1% are DX8 GPU
[8:21] <Shadaez> thats me :D
[8:21] <Shadaez> I think
[8:21] <Shadaez> maybe a dx 9
[8:22] <vede> How do arrays confuse you, Shadaez?

[8:49] <Firetempest> i gave them 10 bucks. people who give them cents are worse then the crazy scotsman form ren and stimpy
[8:49] <Shadaez> how is [2] out of bounds on an array of 2? Rrrrrrrrrr
[8:49] <Keiya> (so that more money can go to the devs of the games who I haven't payed previously :P)
[8:50] <Keiya> Firetempest: What about people who mess with the input box to see what the actual boundry for the 'can't you spare a dollar?' picture is?
[8:50] <Keiya> Are they worse, or are they just weird? ;)
[8:50] <Shadaez> If I had a job they would have got at least $10
[8:50] <Shadaez> s they got $2.
[8:51] <Firetempest> they are worse
[8:52] <Shadaez> I payed 25 cents for world of goo, though

[8:52] <Keiya> I'm just messing with the javascript
[8:53] <Shadaez> I wish I was bill gates and could give them 1,000,000
[8:53] <Keiya> It's probably processor-specific anyway, since they're probably using floats.
[8:53] <Keiya> But :P
[8:53] <Keiya> I like the statistics... Windows users are cheap!
[8:54] <Malikat> Shadaez
[8:54] <Malikat> arrays generally start with 0
[8:54] <Keiya> (Mac users /were/ rich, before they bought their computers, I guess. And linux users channel the savings from their OS to game devs!)
[8:54] <Keiya> Anyway
[8:54] <Keiya> The available balance on my card
[8:54] <Malikat> so an array of 2 would include array(1) array(2)
[8:54] <Keiya> is 18 cents
[8:54] <Malikat> er
[8:54] <Malikat> array(0) array(1)
[8:54] <Malikat> derp
[8:54] <Shadaez> so if I do new array of [2], it doesn't have 3 spaces?
[8:55] <Malikat> no
[8:55] <Shadaez> only 2, at [0], [1]?
[8:55] <Malikat> Yep.
[8:55] <Malikat> generally.
[8:55] <Keiya> So Firetempest, how do I be not evil? ;_;
[8:55] <Malikat> most arrays start at 0
[8:56] <Shadaez> thanks
[8:57] <Keiya> Is it OK to give them next to nothing when you /have/ next to nothing? >_>
[8:57] <Shadaez> give at least 30 cents
[8:57] <Keiya> Shadaez: That would require taking out a 100-dollar loan at high interest

[10:00] <LuciferZ> "Daddy, I had a bad dream."
[10:00] <LuciferZ> You blink your eyes and pull up on your elbows. Your clock glows red in the darkness ? it's 3:23. "Do you want to climb into bed and tell me about it?"
[10:00] <LuciferZ> "No, Daddy."
[10:00] <LuciferZ> The oddness of the situation wakes you up more fully. You can barely make out your daughter's pale form in the darkness of your room. "Why not, sweetie?"
[10:00] <LuciferZ> "Because in my dream, when I told you about the dream, the thing wearing Mommy's skin sat up."
[10:00] <LuciferZ> For a moment, you feel paralyzed; you can't take your eyes off of your daughter. The covers behind you begin to shift.
[10:01] <Visiiri> Shiiiiit
[10:01] <Visiiri> more
[10:01] <Dommys> Yeah, that's prety nice.

[10:02] <Visiiri> And the covers be horses?

[10:02] <Dommys> LuciferZ Steven King wrote a book called Liseys Story where these rural PA folks get all fugged in the brains with basically a posession, they call "bad-gunky" kinda hillbilly folks
[10:02] <LuciferZ> You are home alone, and you hear on the news about the profile of a murderer who is on the loose. You look out the sliding glass doors to your backyard, and you notice a man standing out in the snow. He fits the profile of the murderer exactly, and he is smiling at you.
[10:02] <LuciferZ> You gulp, picking up the phone to your right and dialing 911. You look back out the glass as you press the phone to your ear, and notice he is much closer to you now.
[10:02] <LuciferZ> You then drop the phone in shock. There are no footprints in the snow.
[10:02] <Dommys> Well its narrarated from the 10 year old kids perspective, he wakes up, and his dads standing over his bed staring at him all drooling
[10:02] <LuciferZ> It's his reflection
[10:03] <Visiiri> Shiiiiit
[10:03] <Dommys> And the kid goes "daddy?" : dad goes "Go back slee'"

[10:06] <LuciferZ> This one's not that creepy, but I like it anyways.
[10:06] <LuciferZ> Coffins used to be built with holes in them, attached to six feet of copper tubing and a bell. The tubing would allow air for victims buried under the mistaken impression they were dead. In a certain small town Harold, the local gravedigger, upon hearing a bell one night, went to go see if it was children pretending to be spirits. Sometimes it was also the wind. This time, it wasn't either. A voice from below begged and pl
[10:06] <LuciferZ> "Are you Sarah O'Bannon?" Harold asked.
[10:06] <LuciferZ> "Yes!" The muffled voice asserted.
[10:06] <LuciferZ> "You were born on September 17, 1827?"
[10:06] <LuciferZ> "Yes!"
[10:06] <LuciferZ> "The gravestone here says you died on February 20, 1857."
[10:06] <LuciferZ> "No, I'm alive, it was a mistake! Dig me up, set me free!"
[10:06] <LuciferZ> "Sorry about this, ma'am," Harold said, stepping on the bell to silence it and plugging up the copper tube with dirt. "But this is August. Whatever you are down there, you sure as hell ain't alive no more, and you ain't comin' up."

Once more she awakens to the dripping sound. She reaches her hand down and f

She reaches the bathroom and turns on the light. She is greeted by a horrific sight; hanging from the shower nozzle is her dog with its throat slit open and its blood dripping into the bathtub.
[10:35] <LuciferZ> Something on the bathroom mirror catches her eye she turns around. Written on the bathroom mirror in her dog's blood are the words "HUMANS CAN LICK TOO".

[13:43] <Snowman> Hmmm...
[13:43] <Marach-16> but it's harder
[13:43] <Snowman> Someone else had the same problem a time ago
[13:44] <Snowman> I forgot how to fix it :/
[13:44] <Marach-16> you can be productive in it when you spend a week configuring it
[13:44] <Snowman> I think it's something with the opacity
[13:44] <Marach-16> but then it's a great took.
[13:44] <Marach-16> toolI*
[13:44] <Snowman> kwerty, what number is the opacity slider at?
[13:44] <Marach-16> i wouldn't use it at all though if paint.net had customisable grid
[13:44] <kwerty> I'm using the experimental version for 64-bit windows 7. Surely it can't be that?

[13:46] <kwerty> Normal
[13:46] <Snowman> Hmmm
[13:46] <Marach-16> nosrsly.
[13:46] <Marach-16> gimp isn't for pixelart, really
[13:47] <Snowman> Go to the image tab, then mode and check what mode is selected
[13:47] <Marach-16> it's possible though.
[13:47] <kwerty> Snowman: You mean the layer?
[13:48] <Snowman> No, just press the image button above the image itself, then go to mode
[13:48] <Snowman> And tell me if RGB, grayscale or Indexed is selected
[13:48] <kwerty> Indexed
[13:48] <Snowman> There's your problem
[13:48] <Snowman> Select RGB
[13:48] <Marach-16> indexed...
[13:49] <kwerty> Now all the colors are shades of blue
[13:49] <kwerty> wtf
[13:49] <Marach-16> welcome to gimp kwerty
[13:49] <kwerty> I've used gimp before for some basic photo retouching, it shouldn't be doing shit like this :/

[14:09] <Marach-16> well, Hero Core raised my skills
[14:09] <Marach-16> i hate and love this game at the same time
[14:09] <Speljohan__> nvm
[14:10] <Snowman> I beat like level 70s at MW2
[14:10] <fragmer> hey snowman, you there?
[14:10] <fragmer> wait i guess you are
[14:10] <Snowman> I once beat an entire server that was like level 40+
[14:10] <Snowman> Yeah
[14:10] <Marach-16> poor server :(
[14:10] <Snowman> Or I'm just pro ;)
[14:11] <Speljohan__> i grew away from fps's
[14:11] <Speljohan__> was fun when i was like 10
[14:11] <Speljohan__> lol
[14:11] <Snowman> The best game ever made is still an FPS
[14:11] <Marach-16> which is?
[14:11] <Speljohan__> lies
[14:11] <Speljohan__> best game ever is an rpg
[14:11] <Speljohan__> baldur's gate!!
[14:11] <Marach-16> best game ever is cave story
[14:11] <Marach-16> >:(
[14:11] <Marach-16> casuals
[14:12] <Speljohan__> cave story is fun, but far from best game ever
[14:12] <Snowman> Lol
[14:12] <Marach-16> second is minecraft
[14:12] <Snowman> I once bought baldurs gate
[14:12] <Snowman> CD didn't work
[14:12] <Speljohan__> lolwat
[14:12] <Marach-16> third is Paper Mario
[14:12] <Snowman> But Half-Life is the best game ever
[14:12] <Marach-16> and fourth si Portal.
[14:12] <Snowman> Metacritic agrees
[14:12] <Speljohan__> paper mario is fun
[14:13] <Marach-16> no idea what can be 5th
[14:13] <Marach-16> possible iji
[14:13] <Marach-16> or monster hunter
[14:13] <Speljohan__> baldur's gate 2 takes all prizes, then i guess age of empires is 2nd

[14:15] <Marach-16> i don't say reviews don't influence me at all
[14:15] <Marach-16> hl? like all fps games i played, got boring in the middle
[14:15] <Malikat> okay, i KNOW i shouldn't say this
[14:15] <Malikat> but i think i have a handle on DF so far
[14:15] <Marach-16> i'm not a fan of doing the same thing over and over

[14:16] <Marach-16> omg, Speljohan__ agrees with me. i have to mark that day on calendar
[14:16] <Snowman> Half-Life doesn't really have "doing the same thing over and over"
[14:16] <Marach-16> Snowman: unless you consider pressing switches "puzzles".
[14:17] <Snowman> You have to hold switches sometimes :D
[14:18] <Malikat> i enjoyed half life
[14:19] <Malikat> it was a little bit of platforming and a little bit of puzzling
[14:19] <Malikat> it was a nice combat exploration game with a cool story (bro)
[14:19] <Marach-16> haha, platforming? where?
[14:19] <Snowman> platforming in the lambda core and on xen
[14:19] <Malikat> ^
[14:19] <Marach-16> lol
[14:19] <Snowman> ANd it had no fucking cutscenes
[14:19] <Marach-16> it was so simple
[14:19] <Snowman> I hate cutscenes
[14:20] <Snowman> And it revolutionaised the genre
[14:20] <Malikat> simple is sometimes nice

[14:20] <Speljohan__> real platformers are more fun
[14:20] <Speljohan__> !
[14:20] <Marach-16> and where's that story you're talking about? a person pressed a wrong button and spawned monsters. i walk around and kill everything that moves
[14:20] <bildramer> Half-Life is fucking epic
[14:20] <Marach-16> omg, now bildramer.
[14:20] <bildramer> any attempt to disagree is rendered futile
[14:20] <Malikat> Marach-16: half life didn't fail you, you failed half life
[14:20] <Snowman> It tells the story of an ordinary man who has to fight for his life in order to survive
[14:20] <Malikat> if you think that's all the story was
[14:21] <Marach-16> Snowman: lol
[14:21] <Speljohan__> lol Snowman clich? much
[14:21] <Malikat> cliche isn't instantly bad
[14:21] <Marach-16> it is
[14:21] <Malikat> it just means you have to work to make it interesting
[14:21] <Malikat> which half-life did
[14:21] <Marach-16> and people usually fail at it
[14:21] <Speljohan__> i agree cliche isnt instantly bad
[14:21] <Malikat> by not feeding you the story in cutscenes
[14:21] <Speljohan__> baldur's gate was pretty cliche
[14:21] <Snowman> And of course, the main protagonist is a badass
[14:21] <Speljohan__> but the world was big enough to support several novels
[14:22] <Speljohan__> lots of fantasy politics/regional wars/events around the world
[14:22] <Speljohan__> etc
[14:22] <Marach-16> Snowman: wut? i never even saw him
[14:22] <Marach-16> no mirrors, portals or anything
[14:22] <Snowman> He's on the title screen...

[15:34] <Marach-16> i have to watch it

[15:34] <Marach-16> SPOILERS
[15:34] <Snowman> SOMEONE DIES
[15:35] <Bodie> WHEN THE JETPACK KILLS EVERYONE
[15:35] <Snowman> Multiple people actually

[15:39] <Bodie> i would like to make suggestions
[15:39] <Bodie> :P
[15:39] <Azjherben> well
[15:39] <Marach-16> Bodie: email or twitter
[15:39] <Bodie> true...
[15:39] <Marach-16> or idle for week
[15:39] <Bodie> but i'm sure the idea would have already been submitted
[15:39] <Marach-16> weeks*
[15:39] <Azjherben> I'll port forward in a bit.
[15:39] <Bodie> it'd be more of a confirmation
[15:39] <Azjherben> BBL
[15:39] <Bodie> that hes having it in
[15:39] <Marach-16> also, Notch doesn't enjoy reading suggestions forum
[15:39] <Bodie> yeah
[15:39] <Bodie> its ok
[15:39] <Bodie> i know he knows where hes going with it
[15:40] <Bodie> i should rephrase, i dont want to suggest, i just wanna ask if something is gonna be in the game
[15:40] <Marach-16> he said it makes him feel demotivated by showing how much work is left to do
[15:40] <Bodie> mmh
[15:40] <Marach-16> Bodie: we may know
[15:40] * Evilgrimmy (Mibbit@client-86-31-227-152.oxfd.adsl.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[15:40] <Bodie> its just how the world is randomly generated
[15:40] <Marach-16> omg evil uses mibbit
[15:40] <Bodie> i'd love to see special things, like... shipwrecks
[15:40] <Bodie> ancient ruins
[15:40] <Evilgrimmy> Nonsense Marach.
[15:40] <Evilgrimmy> I'm just not on my regular Computer.
[15:40] <Marach-16> Bodie: they will be there.
[15:41] <Bodie> we talked about it a few days ago
[15:41] <Bodie> also, unique weapons :P
[15:41] <Malikat> anyone interested in watching some dorf fortress and listening to shitty music?
[15:41] <Marach-16> Notch said he'll improve the generator, adding "zones"
[15:41] <Bodie> mmh
[15:41] <Kizzycocoa> trust me bodie. he's a hard man to catch
[15:41] <Flesh> ARGH
[15:41] <Kizzycocoa> I myself am trying to catch him
[15:41] <Malikat> i have a rather picturesque fortress if i do say so myself
[15:41] <Bodie> need a bigger net
[15:41] <Evilgrimmy> Nonsense again. He's not hard to catch, Notch is a great developer.
[15:41] <Bodie> he is indeed
[15:41] <Flesh> if you have a lot of experience with valves hammer editor, put your hand up now
[15:41] <Marach-16> and random objects like shipwrecks are possible. see the random pyramids in early infdev versions
[15:42] <Kizzycocoa> but, he's hard to contact
[15:42] <Kizzycocoa> I do ^^
[15:42] <Flesh> ok, i'm going to quiz you
[15:42] <Flesh> and i want answers
[15:42] <Evilgrimmy> Nope. Email him. He seems pretty open to that.. Well, he was..
[15:42] <Kizzycocoa> kk
[15:42] <Flesh> not excuses
[15:42] <Marach-16> Kizzycocoa: just use twitter.
[15:42] <Kizzycocoa> nope. not
[15:42] <Bodie> well
[15:42] <Bodie> i've used it
[15:42] <Malikat> anyway, for gay fortress action: http://livestream.com/malicraft
[15:42] <Marach-16> he said he's addicted to it
[15:42] <Bodie> i've used hammer editor
[15:42] <kwerty> Marach-16: I'd like to watch that
[15:42] <Kizzycocoa> I don't like twitter. but I won't go into all that again
[15:42] <Kizzycocoa> XP
[15:42] <kwerty> Oops wrong person
[15:43] <Marach-16> ...
[15:43] <Flesh> so i'm compiling my l4d2 map, when it compiles and l4d2 loads up, it gets to the stage where the map is almost finished loading, then i'm hit with a "Steam validation error"
[15:43] <Flesh> what the hell man?
[15:43] <Evilgrimmy> Wow, seems pretty minecraft related Flesh.
[15:43] <Marach-16> ^
[15:43] <Flesh> it is
[15:43] * Evilgrimmy glares at flash.
[15:43] <Flesh> it's a minecraft map
[15:43] <Kizzycocoa> that is just a steam error. how often does it happen?
[15:43] <Flesh> every time i try to compile a map
[15:43] <Kizzycocoa> number?
[15:43] <Bodie> you should let it validate
[15:43] * causticLagomorph_ (chatzilla@client-82-31-18-75.midd.adsl.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[15:44] <Flesh> or use the map command in l4d2
[15:44] <Flesh> there is no number
[15:44] <Flesh> just steam validation error
[15:44] <Kizzycocoa> wait. when does it stop?
[15:44] <Kizzycocoa> Vrad?
[15:44] <Kizzycocoa> Vvis?

[15:44] <Flesh> no, the game actually loads up
[15:44] <Flesh> it stops just before the map finishes loading up
[15:44] <Kizzycocoa> ah. so it's L4D that's the problem?
[15:44] <Evilgrimmy> Like I said. Not very mineraft related. Is it.
[15:44] <Flesh> maybe
[15:44] <Kizzycocoa> can you load normal maps?
[15:45] <Flesh> no and yes
[15:45] <Naserve> Night all
[15:45] <Kizzycocoa> well, it's a source problem, and I can't be of much help.
[15:45] <Flesh> i can load them by starting a normal campaign, but i cant with the map command as i get the same error
[15:45] <Flesh> also to make it minecraft related, how about those half blocks
[15:45] <Kizzycocoa> try http://support.steampowered.com/
[15:45] <Flesh> they suck
[15:45] <Evilgrimmy> Doesn't matter.
[15:45] * Naserve (c4hawktoe@c-24-3-119-94.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) has left #minecraft
[15:45] <Evilgrimmy> Go elsewhere.
[15:45] <Flesh> no
[15:46] <Evilgrimmy> Not #Minecraft.
[15:46] <Kizzycocoa> hey
[15:46] <Bodie> no need to be a dick evilgrimmy
[15:46] <Marach-16> halfblocks are win
[15:46] <Kizzycocoa> I heard people talking about vaginial tumors yesterday
[15:46] <Flesh> you spend enough time in here not talking about minecraft, i figure i'm allowed the same liberty
[15:46] <Bodie> we'd just be talking useless crap, or nothing
[15:46] <Kizzycocoa> your point is invalid
[15:46] <Evilgrimmy> No Bodie, I believe there is a need to be assertive, or as you'd put it. A dick.

[15:46] <Marach-16> Flesh: you are. don't listen to dicks
[15:46] <Flesh> be as assertive as you like
[15:46] <Evilgrimmy> I quit the minecraft community because of idiots like you.
[15:46] <Flesh> it doesnt mean i have to care
[15:46] * Evilgrimmy giggles.
[15:46] <Kizzycocoa> hey, no namecalling :/
[15:46] <Marach-16> Evilgrimmy: so what are you doing in this channel?
[15:46] <Evilgrimmy> Ohh, this is so much fun.
[15:46] <Bodie> nobody was talking about minecraft, so... whats the problem
[15:47] <Evilgrimmy> Marach, Draco told me to go here.
[15:47] <Flesh> so anyway
[15:47] <Marach-16> :/
[15:47] <Flesh> screw valve
[15:47] <Bodie> you should just leave again
[15:47] <Flesh> is my point
[15:47] <Kizzycocoa> what is ANYONE doing here? we have LOADS of idlers
[15:47] <Bodie> if you have a problem
[15:47] <Evilgrimmy> Bodie, people were talking about minecraft related problems, Contacting Notch.
[15:47] <Bodie> yeah but that finished
[15:47] <Kizzycocoa> yeah
[15:47] <Kizzycocoa> with the result of "keep trying. that's all you can do"
[15:47] <Bodie> your crying has caused more of a problem than talking about steam issues anyway
[15:47] <Evilgrimmy> Because some idiot over here decided it'd be more fun to talk about a steam game on a minecraft community.
[15:48] <Evilgrimmy> Dohoho. Crying?
[15:48] <Kizzycocoa> hey
[15:48] <Marach-16> ...
[15:48] <Kizzycocoa> I don't see anyone talking
[15:48] <Marach-16> i smell #mcchatter fag
[15:48] <Kizzycocoa> about ANYTHING minecraft related
[15:48] <Evilgrimmy> Not anymore ehh.
[15:48] <Bodie> you just did
[15:48] <Kizzycocoa> like I said, yesterday was off topic all the way
[15:48] <Bodie> you said minecraft
[15:48] <Bodie> :P
[15:48] <Flesh> so what kind of mapping did you do in hammer anyway?
[15:48] <Kizzycocoa> so, your point is invalidf
[15:48] <Kizzycocoa> a lot
[15:48] <Kizzycocoa> *invalid
[15:48] <Kizzycocoa> ah, portal mapping
[15:49] <Evilgrimmy> It. Does. Not. Matter. What happened yesterday, today, I am here, and I try to uphold rules. Unlike some of you.
[15:49] <Flesh> oh jawsome
[15:49] * Lexi is now known as Lexicality
[15:49] <Evilgrimmy> Related to words!
[15:49] <Kizzycocoa> you aren't a mod.
[15:49] <Flesh> portal would be a pretty fun game to map for i guess
[15:49] <Codlike> Minecraft chatter is preferenced over offtopic discussion, so shut up
[15:49] <Evilgrimmy> No. And neither are you.
[15:49] <Codlike> Not a requirement, preferenced
[15:49] <Kizzycocoa> and I am not upholding it either
[15:49] <Evilgrimmy> Dohoho. I believe this phrase is valid now "Make me"
[15:49] <Flesh> guys
[15:49] <Flesh> please
[15:49] <Flesh> relax for a moment
[15:49] <Kizzycocoa> regardless, in many places, backseat modding is frowned upon.
[15:49] <Evilgrimmy> So, because you're not a mod you don't have to listen to the rules. Of course. Makes perfect snese.
[15:49] <Marach-16> Evilgrimmy: there is no rule that forbids off-topiness
[15:49] <Flesh> oh lord
[15:49] <Marach-16> topic*
[15:49] <Evilgrimmy> I'm not a cop, so I'm totally allowed to loot shops.
[15:50] <Flesh> Evilgrimmy, you are everything thats wrong with the minecraft community
[15:50] <Marach-16> ^
[15:50] <Evilgrimmy> Dohoho..
[15:50] <Flesh> now please, if you dont like what i'm saying, /ignore flesh

[15:50] <Evilgrimmy> Ohh god.. I do believe I am "Rofl"ing in real life now.

[15:51] <Evilgrimmy> Nono, Flesh, please elaborate.
[15:51] <Flesh> elaborate on what?
[15:51] <Evilgrimmy> How I am "Everything that is wrong with the minecraft community"
[15:51] <Kizzycocoa> well, the bitching for one

[15:52] <Malikat> Evilgrimmy: u trollan?
[15:52] <Evilgrimmy> And that is how I am -everything- and I mean everything, because there is no such thing as nothing wrong with the community?
[15:52] <Flesh> i dont really care to talk to you to be honest
[15:52] <Malikat> u trollan
[15:52] <Flesh> effort etc
[15:52] <Evilgrimmy> Malikat, no. And would you mind using proper spelling? I do believe it's "Trolling"
[15:52] <Malikat> stop trollan
[15:52] * Evilgrimmy giggles.
[15:52] <Evilgrimmy> Now that, is weak.
[15:52] <Malikat> what you are doing is known as trollan.
[15:52] <Kizzycocoa> yep
[15:52] <Evilgrimmy> No, it is not.
[15:52] <Marach-16> it is
[15:52] <Kizzycocoa> he's trollin'
[15:52] <Malikat> Yes, si
[15:52] <Malikat> r

[15:52] <Flesh> if it's trolling then it's lame trolling
[15:53] <Evilgrimmy> Hehe, the troll argument has always provided good giggles to me.
[15:53] <Malikat> YOU LOSE
[15:53] <Malikat> GOOD DAY SIR
[15:53] <Flesh> being stupid != trolling
[15:53] <Kizzycocoa> ^^that
[15:53] <Evilgrimmy> Teehee!
[15:53] <Marach-16> but they aren't exclusive
[15:53] <PandaBear> And evil isnt being stupid :P
[15:53] <Evilgrimmy> Ohh god.. This is just. Teehee!
[15:53] <Flesh> aye try that
[15:53] <Flesh> er
[15:53] <Flesh> true*
[15:53] <Flesh> this does not help with my mapping problem though
[15:53] <Evilgrimmy> xD
[15:53] <Kizzycocoa> XDD
[15:53] <Evilgrimmy> I love how whenever people shut down, with no arguments against mine it always resorts to "u trollan"
[15:54] <Kizzycocoa> well, you are
[15:54] <Kizzycocoa> :/
[15:54] <Evilgrimmy> Well, I'm not.
[15:54] <chac> Evilgrimmy: you's troln'
[15:54] <Marach-16> hey, i have an idea
[15:54] <Malikat> stop trying to rouse me to your trollan
[15:54] <Malikat> i only popped in to point out that: u trollan.
[15:54] <Kizzycocoa> if you allow OT discussion to happen, it will stop
[15:54] <Flesh> hey what the hell
[15:54] <Evilgrimmy> I am not. What? That makes very little sense..
[15:54] <Marach-16> /ignore *Evilgrim*!*@* ALL
[15:54] <Flesh> now doors are twice their size
[15:54] <Marach-16> :3
[15:54] <Kizzycocoa> you try to take control, it will get worse
[15:54] <Marach-16> did it myself
[15:55] <Marach-16> now, to wait some minutes so i don't see people talking to air
[15:55] <Evilgrimmy> Nonsense Kizzy, if someone was to take control and you actually listened to their arguments instead of crying "Trollan!" then it will get better.
[15:55] <Malikat> Marach
[15:55] <Malikat> Marach
[15:55] <Flesh> no
[15:55] <Kizzycocoa> this is the internet
[15:55] <Marach-16> what Malikat
[15:55] <Malikat> Hi. :D
[15:55] <Kizzycocoa> your argument is invalid
[15:55] <Evilgrimmy> Kizzycocoa, really? I had not noticed that.
[15:55] <Marach-16> lol
[15:55] <Flesh> if someone listened to your arguements, we'd be talking pointless crap all day that would go nowhere
[15:55] <Evilgrimmy> What, my argument is -not- invalid, please, do tell how my argument is invalid.
[15:55] * Flesh shrugs
[15:55] <Flesh> it would just be a waste of time
[15:56] <Flesh> internet fights etc
[15:56] <Kizzycocoa> ugh. I'm feeding a troll >.> I'll stop now =3
[15:56] <Malikat> Evilgrimmy is neither invalid or valid, Evilgrimmy so far has been completely content-free in her(?) choice of statements
[15:56] <Evilgrimmy> No. It would not, if you listened to my arguments we could stop talking about Left Four Dead maps and could actually talk about something that I came here for. #Minecraft. See?
[15:56] <Flesh> no i'd keep talking about it
[15:56] <Evilgrimmy> Malikat, I had at least one content, and that is Left Four Dead =/= Minecraft.
[15:56] <Evilgrimmy> Flesh, that is because you are ignorant.
[15:56] <Flesh> maybe
[15:57] <Kizzycocoa> so, is your problem solved flesh?
[15:57] <Evilgrimmy> No, you are.
[15:57] <Flesh> naw
[15:57] <Marach-16> it isn't
[15:57] <Malikat> minecraft discussion takes precedence over off topic discussion
[15:57] <Malikat> it does not preclude off topic discussion
[15:57] * Evilgrimmy giggles.
[15:57] <Marach-16> Malikat: and there's no minecraft discusstion right now
[15:57] <Malikat> end of discussion
[15:57] <Malikat> :D
[15:57] <Marach-16> -t
[15:57] <Evilgrimmy> What, it's not the end, you can't have an argument with only one side in it.

[18:04] <Marach-17> it was fixed in infdev
[18:04] <vede> Except water and lighting.
[18:04] <vede> indev's water is broke-as-fuck.
[18:05] <vede> I play infdev primarily, because I like the large terrain features.

[20:06] <vurtual> so I own CIV IV twice.
[20:07] <vurtual> if my old PC started and worked with CIV IV fully again, I could play against myself.
[20:07] <PieceOfcake> I mean the physical thing, not the games on itself
[20:07] <vurtual> The fun way. Running up a flight of stairs.
[20:07] <vede> Give them twenty or thirty years to stew, and I'm sure we'll be seeing people going "OH WOW A CD HOLY CRAP RETRO"
[20:07] <vurtual> CDs will never truuuuly go out of date.
[20:07] <vurtual> They'll just be like "Woah, this disc is old, I have no player to support it inherently."
[20:08] <vede> vurtual, why wouldn't they?

[20:41] <PieceOfcake> Why don't they do the same for InDev ?
[20:41] <vurtual> because it's just one map
[20:41] <Marach-17> PieceOfcake: indev is old. not developed anymore

[20:43] <vurtual> DF has an even more nolifey dev
[20:44] <Marach-17> FakeSky: i think both
[20:44] <Marach-17> Notch said why he doesn't want dock involved, and he agreed
[20:44] <Marach-17> but at least we gained 2 things:
[20:44] <Marach-17> 1. RANA
[20:44] <Marach-17> 2. i got free tumbledrop
[20:44] <PieceOfcake> Now that I found coal, i can't get to find iron... YEAH RIGHT.
[20:45] <PieceOfcake> Oh and, is it normal that a iron pickaxe works better than a gold one ?
[20:45] <Marach-17> gold works like wood
[20:45] <PieceOfcake> Why is gold so precious then
[20:45] <Marach-17> it will probably gain special abilities in the future
[20:45] <PieceOfcake> Oh yeah like that.
[20:45] <wry> like magic
[20:45] <Marach-17> like enchanting or something

[23:06] <Ether_S> MineCraft is ridiculously overpriced for what it is, modified infiniminer code. The current price should be half of what it is, and after alpha it should stay the same.
[23:06] <vurtual> Ether_S
[23:06] <vurtual> It's not infiminer code
[23:07] <vurtual> Not even the same language last I knew
[23:07] <Firetempest> its like saying oh DF is just rogue like

[23:07] <Ether_S> DF is free so it does not warrant any complaints like that.
[23:07] <SpaceManiac> oh man blog entry :V
[23:08] <vurtual> mineccraft isn't built from the infiminer source.
[23:08] <Ether_S> In the last 24 hours 71 people bought this game.
[23:08] <vurtual> it was made from scratch
[23:08] <Ether_S> He's not even working full time and he is rolling cash.
[23:08] <Ether_S> It's overpriced.
[23:08] <vurtual> and?
[23:08] <vurtual> People are entirely okay with the price.
[23:08] <Firetempest> It'll be his only job all too soon.
[23:08] <Adura> Price is dependant on demand.
[23:09] <Adura> At this rate, he could raise the price.
[23:09] <Firetempest> if people are willing to pay for it as is, that is their problem
[23:09] <whatdoestha> Actually, in the gaming market, I'll disagree. Not accusing Notch of anything, but the price of video games is based on what the publisher can get away with.
[23:09] <vurtual> He got away with 15
[23:09] <SpaceManiac> psh
[23:09] <whatdoestha> see: Modern Warfare 2 map pack
[23:09] <SpaceManiac> kids these days
[23:10] <vurtual> 15 dollars isn't that much
[23:10] <SpaceManiac> expecting their games to be 99 cents each

[23:10] <Rooster> Learning Lua is difficult, yet really cool.
[23:10] <Firetempest> 3 hours, good god
[23:10] <Ether_S> What cost does he incur?
[23:10] <vurtual> buy now Ether_S.
[23:10] <vurtual> it'll probably go down soon.
[23:10] <Rooster> What do you mean Firetempest
[23:11] <vurtual> He has to live off of his profits.
[23:11] <Firetempest> i forgot how bad it was to work min wage
[23:11] <vurtual> 3 hours isn't that long.
[23:11] <Ether_S> He's had a job for the duration. Derived inspiration from another game, has other people host the servers.
[23:11] <vurtual> Valve doesn't host all their TF2 servers
[23:11] <Adura> He's a good businessman.
[23:11] <vurtual> they basically took a mod, which wasn't theirs
[23:11] <vurtual> and tf itself was inspired by something else!

[23:12] <Ether_S> But as a gamer, who plays games, buys games, it's too much. Especially considering the quality.
[23:12] <vurtual> One-time pay, good community, constant content updates even after release, lots of servers, fun....
[23:12] <vurtual> This is madness.
[23:12] <vurtual> MADNESS

[23:13] <vurtual> Ether_S, because we have disposable income.
[23:13] <Adura> People in here tend to like the game.
[23:13] <vurtual> 15-30 dollars isn't much to some people here.
[23:13] <Ether_S> Good point vurtual, TF2 is backed by a robust and frequent amount of updates, so a crude block game in js is worth 10 euros.
[23:13] <vurtual> to some it means not starving
[23:13] <whatdoestha> "because we have disposable income" is never a valid thing to say, sorry.
[23:13] <vurtual> Ether_S, minecraft gets updates.
[23:14] <vurtual> Once it's released, notch himself said that he's going to keep adding new stuff.

[23:14] <vurtual> too bad it's in java.
[23:14] <whatdoestha> And I bought minecraft, by the way, I just don't care for people glossing over things and using logical fallacies to gloss over cricisim
[23:14] <whatdoestha> ...I can type, really.
[23:14] <vurtual> I have 15 dollars
[23:15] <Ether_S> Could you make your point with our technical semantics or irrelevant analogies, like TF2 or the theater.
[23:15] <vurtual> I do not NEED these 15 dollars, but i want to spend it on something
[23:15] <vurtual> oh look a minecraft
[23:15] <vurtual> hmmm
[23:15] * vurtual looks at his 15 dollars
[23:15] * vurtual looks at minecraft
[23:15] <Marach-17> Ether_S: don't buy it if you want. nobody's forcing you
[23:15] <Adura> The point is the price is based on demand.
[23:15] * vurtual leaves with a minecraft
[23:15] <Ether_S> Damn vurtual get notch's dong out of your mouth jesus.
[23:15] <Marach-17> now save us time and quit
[23:15] <vurtual> no you get yours out of mine
[23:15] <Adura> So long as it's selling, the price will stay the same or go up.
[23:15] <Ether_S> I bought MineCraft already, I enjoy it, but I think it is overpriced.
[23:15] <vurtual> THEN ASK FOR A REFUND
[23:15] <Adura> Others don't.
[23:16] <vurtual> OR COMPLAIN TO NTOCH HIMSELF
[23:16] <Ether_S> I'm saying Notch doesn't deserve the success based on his work.
[23:16] <vurtual> I don't even like this game that much.
[23:16] <Marach-17> i thought it's worth the price 9 months ago
[23:16] <vurtual> I got gifted it on christmas!
[23:16] <Adura> Other people don't agree with you, Ether_S.
[23:16] <Ether_S> Good point adura.
[23:16] <Ether_S> Wait
[23:16] <vurtual> DO YOU THINK I HAVE A REASON TO SUPPORT YOU? NO I DO NOT
[23:16] <Ether_S> Actually that's a retarded point
[23:16] <vurtual> FIFTEEN DOLLARS IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY
[23:16] <whatdoestha> I think $15 is a fair price, but $30 will be too much, and likely see a drastic drop in sales.
[23:16] <vurtual> 30 DOLLARS, WHEN IT'S GOT EVEN MORE CONENT, IS NOT A BAD PRICE EITHER
[23:16] <Adura> It's retarded all the way to the bank.
[23:16] <Ether_S> lol
[23:16] <vurtual> CHANCES ARE HE'LL LOWER IT IF IT DOESN'T WORK
[23:16] <Ether_S> 30 bucks for this pos.
[23:17] <Firetempest> CAPS is serious business
[23:17] <vurtual> stop playing it
[23:17] <Ether_S> Yeah honestly now.
[23:17] <Marach-17> CAPS ARE AWESOME
[23:17] <vurtual> Complete these steps:
[23:17] <Ether_S> Calm down vurtual I'm not attacking you
[23:17] <whatdoestha> Again, "$15 is not a lot of money" is never a valid response to criticism.
[23:17] <Adura> I don't think complaining here will help with buyer's remorse.
[23:17] <Ether_S> Act more civil you puerile dipshit
[23:17] <whatdoestha> That's what people say when they want to justify buying horse armor and map packs.
[23:17] <vurtual> it's not a map pack no
[23:17] <Ether_S> I don't have buyer's remorse, I'm satisfied.
[23:17] <vurtual> It's a game, you buy once, and then have.
[23:18] <Adura> But, you called it a "pos"...
[23:18] <vurtual> 1. leave channel 2. delete anything minecraft related 3. Disconnect any ties that may try to bring you back.
[23:18] <vurtual> boom
[23:18] <Adura> Mixed messages.
[23:18] <Marach-17> fuck that. back to my server
[23:18] <vurtual> no more minecraft
[23:18] <Ether_S> It's a pretty shitty game but I enjoy it.
[23:18] <whatdoestha> Also, you can safely ignore vurtual, he never has anything intelligent to add.
[23:18] <Adura> You seem trollish.
[23:18] <Firetempest> sweet, a brand new Rocket Knight, for only $11.99. god i loved rocket knight
[23:18] <Adura> So, I shall depart this conversation.
[23:18] <vurtual> I have plenty of intelligence to add, whatdoestha.
[23:18] <vurtual> Nobody ever notices this, because I don't take anyone seriously, at all, but I do.
[23:18] <Ether_S> Be quiet vurtual.
[23:18] <Marach-17> ^
[23:18] <Ether_S> I don't need your grade school ideology on why you're a dipshit.

[23:19] <Ether_S> Whatever aloof or apathetic justification for your ill-behavior you have, I don't fucking care.
[23:19] <vurtual> Either way, if you really, really hate having spent 15 dollars on the game, ask notch for a refund. If you want to tell everyone to stop having fun because of your opinion, then you should go play super smash bros melee instead.
[23:19] <Firetempest> you kinda do when you denounce him in such a way don't you?
[23:19] <Marach-17> welcome to #minecraft - a silent competition who can be the biggest dick to newcomers
[23:20] <Rooster> Ether_S are you sad you can't get the game or something?
[23:20] <vurtual> Everyone else is entirely fine with the price, if you really, reallllly have a problem with the price, get a refund from him.
[23:20] <Marach-17> vurtual is leading with 17 pissed off newcomers
[23:20] <Ether_S> And to conclude, if Notch has any semblence of decency he'll lower the price of this hugely successful yet crude work, out of shame and humility.
[23:20] <Marach-17> Quatroking is second
[23:20] <Quatroking> second in what

[23:21] <vurtual> Oh no some guy has insulted me and all the regulars with his toughguy ego! I am in such humiliation! I have seen the light about my crude work, and must lower the price to some imaginary figure nobody suggested!
[23:21] <Quatroking> meh
[23:21] <Quatroking> Hell if i care, vurtual is already shitting his pants over it
[23:22] <Marach-17> yeah
[23:22] <Marach-17> don't steal his frag
[23:22] <Quatroking> Wait is that newbie saying that Notch should lower the price?
[23:22] <Rooster> Notch leaves in Sweden, doesn't he have to give most of his profits to the government?
[23:22] <vurtual> Thanks to this random guy who clearly is the first person to ever say this, I have truly been able to seek forgiveness for this horrible, horrible crime!
[23:22] <Marach-17> he's implying that
[23:22] <Quatroking> Haha, what a joke
[23:22] <Ether_S> Vurtual did I hurt your feelings?
[23:22] <Quatroking> Ether_S, you're the person right
[23:22] <Ether_S> I'm sorry, don't feel sad.
[23:22] <Rooster> Ye
[23:22] <vurtual> Yes, obviously. I am crying riiiivers here.
[23:22] <Marach-17> he is
[23:22] <vurtual> Riiiiivers.
[23:22] <Quatroking> You do understand that Notch is making Minecraft his full-time work
[23:23] <quaxar> Notch should invent a in game currency and live off of micro transactions
[23:23] <vurtual> So much that it'll cause another midwest flood with my tears of hurt because soome guy on the internet wasn't nice.
[23:23] <Rooster> I think Ether_S is just pissy about something

[23:24] <vurtual> or trolling.
[23:24] <bildramer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbY4ixm_ZM
[23:24] <vurtual> Either or.
[23:25] <Adura> $15 is a month of food for some African kid.
[23:25] <bildramer> PMS?
[23:25] <Ether_S> Damn vurtual, I come in with a serious complaint and you get your feelings hurt. Calm down youngster.
[23:25] <bildramer> lol Adura
[23:25] <bildramer> we don't care
[23:25] <vurtual> post-menestural-syndrome or whatever
[23:25] <Quatroking> Adura: africans don't work for their money
[23:25] <Adura> You don't care about African kids?
[23:25] <bildramer> anyone with enough money to have a computer is able to buy Minecraft
[23:25] <Ether_S> I'm discussing things with daddy, go chill in the corner.
[23:25] <vurtual> 15 dollars is a month of mountain dew for me.
[23:25] <Rooster> Yes, Notch has to give like 60% of his money to Sweden (cause they are socialist?) so of course he has to raise prices
[23:25] <vurtual> Please, think of the nerds.
[23:25] <Siiseli> vurtual, a month?
[23:25] <Marach-17> bildramer: having the money != being able to
[23:25] <bildramer> ...
[23:25] <bildramer> wat

[23:26] <Siiseli> you bastards
[23:26] <vurtual> It's proabbly a bit more than that
[23:26] <bildramer> How can someone have 50000$ and not be able to buy a car for example?
[23:26] <vurtual> maybe 12.
[23:26] <Rooster> I like how Ether isn't really talking anymore but we are.
[23:26] <Quatroking> fuck you vurtual
[23:26] <Marach-17> omg Siiseli speaks!
[23:26] <vurtual> either way, 15 dollars can dew me up for a month easily.
[23:26] <bildramer> lol
[23:26] <Siiseli> well, bildramer, half of notch's income goes to taxes
[23:26] <Quatroking> oh wait
[23:26] <Rooster> Dew it up
[23:26] <Siiseli> nad he needs money to you know
[23:26] * Quatroking calculates
[23:26] <Siiseli> LIVE
[23:26] <bildramer> um
[23:26] <bildramer> totally unrelated?
[23:26] <bildramer> I'm talking about the MC price
[23:26] <Quatroking> nevermind vurtual
[23:26] <Rooster> yes
[23:27] <Quatroking> Anyways, like I said
[23:27] <bildramer> and that if you have a computer you already have spent lots more
[23:27] <Siiseli> oh I thought you were talking about notch's money from minecraft
[23:27] <Rooster> That's his income bildramer
[23:27] <Quatroking> Minecraft is awesome.
[23:27] <vurtual> Also if you guys want to come here you can have some mountain dew. Give me smoe warning though, or I'll give you the old cans.
[23:27] <Quatroking> Buy it.
[23:27] <Ether_S> In summation, Notch is making huge bank, comparable to the work of a full PROFESSIONAL dev team working 80 hour weeks, while he works much more Laxly. Besides making more money than these hard working teams, he also has a band of loyal IRC scrubs to defend his crude and overpriced work.

[23:27] <Siiseli> well, Ether_S, he does ALL the work himself
[23:27] <Quatroking> vurtual, he wished
[23:27] <Rooster> Ether_S most of his money goes to /the government/
[23:27] <Siiseli> where in a dev team you get paid monthly to do a certain one thing
[23:27] <Quatroking> out of each 10 euros less than 4 euros goes to Notch
[23:27] <vurtual> He's pretty much almost married now.
[23:27] <Siiseli> he works, in a sense, a lot more
[23:27] <Ether_S> Dev teams get paid shit.
[23:27] <Quatroking> hooray for tax eh
[23:28] <Ether_S> They don't get royalties.
[23:28] <Siiseli> 15 dollars is by far not too much :D
[23:28] <vurtual> so 4 euros per purchase
[23:28] <Rooster> Does anyone know if his girlfriend works?
[23:28] <vurtual> to support his whole family
[23:28] <Quatroking> Yeah, ez works
[23:28] <vurtual> Do you want his children to starve, Ether_S!?
[23:28] <Ether_S> Notch gets 100%of the revenue, and the vast majority is profit.
[23:28] <Rooster> no

[23:28] <Marach-17> vurtual: lol
[23:28] <Ether_S> 100% of revenue obviously goes to him. Revenue is just the money in, not money he keeps.
[23:28] <Adura> Just have fun with them now.

[23:51] <Quatroking> why do you guys always have such shitty wiring
[23:51] <vurtual> I found the first, and the third, but not the second.
[23:51] <vurtual> It's like... nowhere to be found.
[23:52] <vurtual> Unless I find an item which there is no room for(I checked!) in this area.

[23:52] <Firetempest> I live in NC, they are so damn lax about everything. especially shoddy electrical wiring jobs. when i was west coat iv never had as many electrical problems
[23:52] <Quatroking> ugh
[23:53] <Quatroking> Really, marach
[23:53] <Marach> ya rly
[23:53] <Quatroking> what game are you getting with it
[23:53] <Quatroking> wii fit?
[23:53] <Marach> neno, probably
[23:53] <Marach> none*
[23:53] <vurtual> don't buy the prime trilogy
[23:53] <vurtual> it got nerfed
[23:53] <Marach> i heard about that
[23:53] <Parthon> bweh?
[23:54] <Marach> i'm not a big fan of challenges anyway
[23:54] <Parthon> how did it get nerfed?
[23:54] <vurtual> Marach, as in
[23:55] <vurtual> They added a "hard difficulty" for prime 2
[23:55] <vurtual> and it is easier than the original game, still.
[23:55] <vurtual> The game would be boring without the difficulty.
[23:55] <Marach> fuck my psp analog >:(
[23:55] <Marach> cursor flails like crazy
[23:55] <Marach> and i cba to clean it or something
[23:55] <Firetempest> is it just the control scheme that makes is easier, or like actually less shots to kill or less damage taken
[23:56] <vurtual> they made it easier
[23:56] <vurtual> not just the controls
[23:56] <vurtual> every boss is weaker by alot
[23:56] <vurtual> among actual changes, I think there's light crystals in the boost guardian now
[23:56] <Firetempest> meh
[23:56] <vurtual> I mean, if you're good at the game, most of the bosses can go down pretty quick anyways(boost guardian is no fun if it isn't a race against time)
[23:57] <Marach> wow, hitting links becomes a metagame
[23:57] <vurtual> Marach needs a lock on
[23:57] <bildramer> the game

[23:57] <bildramer> rape is bad
[23:57] <vurtual> or just keep exploring?
