[0:18] <Darnest> Marach-05: there is a point... I wanted to take a look at his code
[0:18] <Caleo> so, I've noticed that iron and coal tend to be right next to eachother... does gold or diamond ever tend to be near iron/coal?
[0:18] <Darnest> Marach-05: maybe run ocr on it
[0:18] <Marach-05> Darnest: why won't you just watch the vid again
[0:18] <Zaneo> he did the tiny vikings game on livestream
[0:18] <Darnest> Marach-05: it wont load?
[0:19] <Marach-05> it should
[0:19] <rbos> caleo - the only diamond I found seemed to be an intersection between an iron and a coal vein, it was pretty epic
[0:19] <Darnest> Marach-05: when I click it it redirects to http://www.livestream.com/mojang
[0:19] <Darnest> which gives 404
[0:19] <Marach-05> strange

[0:26] <Norend> Hopefully he doesn't lol
[0:26] <Marach-05> why
[0:26] <ClassiestMedic> because
[0:26] <ClassiestMedic> We all want a chance
[0:26] <Marach-05> it shouldn't be just random
[0:26] <Snowman> It's a Lost reference ..>
[0:26] <Marach-05> people have to deserve
[0:26] <AfroSammy> ...Deserve? : \
[0:27] <Snowman> Does it matter who we "think" is gonna be in the test?
[0:27] <Snowman> Let's just wait till Notch says who is in.
[0:27] <fenixfurion> ^
[0:27] <Norend> Great idea
[0:27] <IceFlinger> what
[0:27] <IceFlinger> huh
[0:27] <Yourself> if you go in the channel logs notch said he will be playing favorites
[0:27] <AfroSammy> Seriously, that's been talked about waaaay too much.

[0:27] <Norend> Favouriting
[0:28] <Norend> :C
[0:28] <Marach-05> i think he will do "why would you want to be a beta tester?" then shoose from answers
[0:28] <Marach-05> choose*
[0:28] <AfroSammy> All the answers are going to be the same, minus the butt-kissing ones
[0:28] <Marach-05> you think?
[0:28] <Norend> yeah probably
[0:28] <Marach-05> most people are newcomers
[0:28] <AfroSammy> Yep.
[0:29] <Norend> He should set up a place to sign up, then draw random
[0:29] <Marach-05> and most people didn't beta test any game before
[0:29] <Norend> Or pick people who have played for awhile
[0:29] <Quatroking> yeah, citricsquid, fuck you too. http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?p=184283#p184283
[0:29] <rbos> any betatester should be willing to, eg, report problems
[0:29] <Marach-05> i'm neither of those
[0:29] <Marach-05> :D
[0:29] <Quatroking> Guys, guys, guys.
[0:29] <Quatroking> Hold on.
[0:29] <Darnest> Minecraft needs DRM
[0:29] <Norend> LOL
[0:29] <Snowman> Norend, no he shouldn't. He should pick people who know stuff about beta testing, who know stuff about the game they're playing, who know when stuff isn't right. Not just random goofs
[0:29] <Marach-05> ^
[0:29] <Quatroking> Quit whining about multiplayer survival, please.
[0:29] <Darnest> Why doesn't minecraft have DRM?
[0:29] <Quatroking> Its getting annoying to hear the same damn thing over and over.
[0:30] <Marach-05> Quit whining about us whining about multiplayer survival, please.
[0:30] <Darnest> DRM in minecraft would be cool
[0:30] <Snowman> Quatroking, I agree.
[0:30] <Norend> That's also why I said pick people who know about the game and such
[0:30] <Snowman> DRM makes Notch angry
[0:30] <Marach-05> Norend: everyone "knows" about the game
[0:30] <Snowman> <Norend>> He should set up a place to sign up, then draw random
[0:30] <Norend> You know what I mean though
[0:30] <Norend> Or pick people who have played for awhile
[0:30] <Marach-05> just as everyone "trusts" Friend Computer
[0:30] <AndrewPH> aaaa
[0:30] <Snowman> Doesn't sound like that only people who know about the game could sign up there
[0:31] <Darnest> AndrewPH: do you think minecraft should DRM
[0:31] <Quatroking> I kinda agree with Snowman, you should know a bit about basic gaming stuff if you want to test a game real good.
[0:31] <Quatroking> Do things gamer's normally don't do.
[0:31] <Norend> You get what I mean though
[0:31] <AfroSammy> Why? So all the normal people are left in the dust?
[0:31] <Marach-05> exactly
[0:31] <Marach-05> :D
[0:31] <Quatroking> repeat actions over and over..
[0:31] <Snowman> AfroSammy, beta testing isn't about getting to play the game early
[0:31] <Norend> He should pick his friends and companions
[0:31] <Quatroking> throw crap at each others
[0:31] <Snowman> It's to get rid of the bugs
[0:31] <Snowman> And test if it works
[0:32] <Quatroking> Yup.
[0:32] <AndrewPH> I've beta tested a game before
[0:32] <Wervyn> I think you people worry about this way too much. I could care less about getting an advance beta.
[0:32] <Wervyn> But not much less.
[0:32] <Norend> We are going to get multiplayer one way or another, so we shouldn't worry
[0:32] <Marach-05> i always played games the different way. turning left when i'm told to turn right
[0:32] <Quatroking> I remember betatesting Bumptop
[0:32] <AfroSammy> Well I know that, that's not what I mean.
[0:32] * slothic-AFK is now known as Slothic
[0:32] <Marach-05> finding glitches, exploiting features
[0:32] <Quatroking> As well as Quake Live
[0:32] <AfroSammy> This channel gives me a creepy ping noise too lol
[0:32] <Snowman> I beta tested HL2:Ep3
[0:32] <Norend> lol
[0:32] <Quatroking> Lol
[0:32] <Rooster> I beta tested Duke Nukem Forever
[0:32] <Marach-05> lol
[0:32] <Wervyn> Game'll be done when it's done. Open testing will PROBABLY begin in less than a couple weeks. Surely, you can find something to do with your time until then.
[0:33] <Snowman> Is that even in beta?
[0:33] <Quatroking> No, but seriously, I did betatest Bumptop and Quake Live
[0:33] <AfroSammy> Like try and save Indev on OSC lol
[0:33] <Norend> Notch tweeted that he will be beta testing this week
[0:33] <AfroSammy> 'OSX
[0:33] <Quatroking> Also, I betatest Dropbox and Firefox
[0:33] <Quatroking> running beta builds :3
[0:33] <lolman> chaz go off my account now
[0:33] <Marach-05> i alpha-test minecraft
[0:34] <Quatroking> Anyways, we'll just see who gets to test the beta.
[0:34] <lolman> i will finish the inn
[0:34] <Snowman> I beta test OpenTTD

[0:34] * ClassiestMedic waves back
[0:34] <Marach-05> i betatested 3 iPhone games
[0:34] <Snowman> And some shitty half-assed translated spanish pokemon game

[0:34] <Snowman> fan made

[0:50] <Slothic> i think its quite unfair that some ppl get to be named "oldies". Just cause they were lucky enough to find the game before the rest of us.
[0:51] <Ticki> Nah
[0:51] <RaidSoft> it's not about luck, it's about how much effort you put into trolling the net for stuff :P
[0:51] <Yourself> i think it's unfair that we weren't all born at exactly the same time under the exact same circumstances
[0:51] <Slothic> No, i stumbled upon minecraft on youtube.
[0:51] <Snowman> So you say all the new people should be called oldies?
[0:51] <Slothic> No.
[0:51] <Slothic> i say, remove the status, make us all equal?
[0:51] <Slothic> <.<
[0:51] <sppt> haha Marach-05 i think he forgot to take one away
[0:51] <Chezhea> I was never an oldie to anything, now that I think about it
[0:51] <sppt> :>
[0:51] <Marach-05> Slothic: you wouldn't think so if you were an oldie yourself

[0:51] <Marach-05> sppt: ?

[0:52] <Slothic> marach-05: I would care more for status removal if i was an oldie yes.
[0:52] <Snowman> That's what you say now.
[0:52] <Slothic> so?
[0:52] <RaidSoft> such jealousy..
[0:52] <RaidSoft> who cares? seriously
[0:52] <Marach-05> ^
[0:52] <Slothic> Youre supposed to get status cause youve found a game on google before i did?..
[0:52] <Slothic> <.<
[0:52] <Slothic> i mean cmon.
[0:52] <Slothic> is the world really come to that?
[0:52] <Slothic> <.<
[0:52] <Marach-05> i didnt find it on google.

[2:09] <GoaLitiuM> btw, indev and infdef are going publiic soon, is notch going to pull survival later from puplic when game is approaching version 1.0?

[2:10] <Quatroking> hmm
[2:10] <Schaap> no
[2:10] <exe-> manic digger devinf > minecraft infdev
[2:10] <Animator> Hm. I usually fix up de-railed topics. I'd probably lock that topic up, though, because most OS discussions lead to flame wars, even if there are multiple attempts to keep it professional.
[2:10] <Malikat> i would love to not have been banned for pulling a harmless prank, on the topic of the forum. >:
[2:10] <Quatroking> Animator, isn't the fact that people are trying to keep it professional enough to keep the topic open?
[2:10] <Quatroking> I really wanted to add onto the discussion but nooo, topic was closed and the derailers didn't even get a goddamn warning
[2:11] <Quatroking> Its like shutting down a football competition because one player made an error
[2:11] <Quatroking> Its not fair for the other persons

[2:12] <Animator> The number of retards outnumber the amount of people wanting to keep it professional. As for the warns, I'll check on their warn logs. The best thing you could possibly do is re-create the thread for the purpose of having an intellectual conversation about it. I'll keep watch on it for the sake of preventing de-railing.
[2:12] <bildramer> tl;dr
[2:12] <Quatroking> Animator you're pretty much telling me the same stegriff did
[2:13] <Quatroking> "make a new topic"

[2:40] <KodaichiZero> I vote myself for OP so I can kick myself for saying so.
[2:41] <Malikat> Animator: The point i'm trying to establish is that I was banned based on one topic, wherein i didn't break any stated rules or majorly violate the unstated ones
[2:41] <OnyxFantasy> Yeah those a recordings because he's not on now .
[2:41] <KodaichiZero> a poor miserable bastard like me doesn't deserve OP in a million years

[2:41] <Animator> You're welcome, rbos.
[2:41] <Malikat> i agree that misleading people about a contest would have been a ban-worthy offense IF i were actually harming the community.
[2:41] <Yourself> if you opped me my ignore list would become the channel's ignore list
[2:41] <Dommys> rbos, it wouldn't be so bad if they were allowed to strike with impunity.
[2:41] <KodaichiZero> Malikat:
[2:41] <AndrewPH> Animator, thank you for being a generous overlord that protects us from the mibbit-using meme-spouting idiots that sometimes join this channel.
[2:41] <Animator> You were, by feeding them lies about a touchy subject.
[2:41] <whatdoestha> I think that means you should've been banned longer, then, since you obviously don't think you really did much wrong.
[2:42] <KodaichiZero> remember I sent you that super long reply?

[2:42] <Animator> People flood this channel and the forums for those kinds of updates, Malikat, Use your common sense.
[2:42] <Wervyn> Oh suck it up. You were making a fairly average troll. You're still doing it. No need to get all indignant about the details.
[2:42] <Malikat> i read it, i didn't have anything to respond about
[2:42] <KodaichiZero> fyi I love to waste my time with typing
[2:42] <KodaichiZero> so dont feel special ;)

[2:43] <Malikat> i used my common sense. I thought it would be funny.
[2:43] <Animator> Wervyn pretty much summed up my sentiments in a good manner.
[2:43] <KodaichiZero> i did not lol
[2:43] <Malikat> not just to me, but to other people.
[2:43] <Dommys> I don't know how these things work
[2:43] * Animator hi-fives Wyvern.
[2:43] <Wervyn> Heh, hi.
[2:43] <Malikat> i'm not trolling.
[2:43] <Dommys> I thought it was funny.
[2:43] <Malikat> i was, yes.
[2:43] <KodaichiZero> Wanna talk about caves?
[2:44] <Dommys> I like caves
[2:44] <whatdoestha> There's a lot of things that are "funny" to post, and most of them will in fact get someone banned from about anywhere

[2:44] <Malikat> whatdoestha: the difference between what you are talking about and my sort of funny is that my sort of funny doesn't harm anyone.
[2:44] <SubBoy> I'm idly curious if it's a permenant ban, or a temporary one.
[2:45] <Animator> The admins have yet to decide.
[2:45] <Malikat> are you fucking kidding me
[2:45] <Animator> ez was pretty angry about it.
[2:45] <KodaichiZero> owwie kazowwie
[2:45] <Wervyn> Heh, that'd be hilarious.
[2:45] <Cial> sounds well planed
[2:46] <SubBoy> I personaly think that a 1 warning system is always fair, but I'm not incharge in the least.
[2:46] <Cial> what did he say?
[2:46] <KodaichiZero> 1 warning: oh there's things that people really, really should get instantly banned for.
[2:46] <Malikat> i personally think that the person who banned me should have locked the topic and told me to post a retraction
[2:46] <AndrewPH> I think a warning system based on how a person's day went is more fair
[2:46] <Malikat> which i would have done
[2:46] <KodaichiZero> like posting links to shock images, etc

[2:46] <SubBoy> Maybe if it has legal implications, but that's it.
[2:47] <AndrewPH> and then of course things that will get you banned using a static warning system
[2:47] <Malikat> and i've been planning, since the time when i thought it was a 6 hour ban and when i realized it was a week ban, to post a retraction
[2:47] <KodaichiZero> SubBoy: yes we all know there are illegal kinds of images out there.

[2:48] <Malikat> alright, i'm gonna go back to what i was doing.
[2:48] <KodaichiZero> Banning of course doesn't have to be permanent
[2:48] <KodaichiZero> a day or two
[2:48] <whatdoestha> I'm more in favor of instant banning for everything but really minor offenses, with ban duration being the only variable
[2:49] <KodaichiZero> how about
[2:49] <KodaichiZero> post restriction
[2:49] * Mack is now known as ddt
[2:49] <whatdoestha> But that's because I'm a bitter asshole who doesn't have the slightest bit of hope for humanity
[2:49] <KodaichiZero> like never being allowed to start a new topic, fior like a week.
[2:49] <Yourself> i'm of the philosophy that banning should only be reserved for those that can't be reasoned with
[2:49] <Malikat> because either animator is 100% honest, implying the forum administration is .. absurd. or it's not true. either way i can't do anything about it
[2:49] <Malikat> sorry i caused a huge fuss, i didn't mean to seem like a troll
[2:49] <whatdoestha> If you tried to reason with everyone who needed to be banned, you'd be there all day every day
[2:49] <KodaichiZero> Yourself: you also believe it's possible to manage a userbase of 10,000+
[2:49] <Animator> I am 100% honest.
[2:50] <Chezhead> Wait, who got banned?
[2:50] <Malikat> (i'll respond to anything people want to say to me via PM, this is my last post on the topic in this channel)
[2:50] <Chezhead> I just put up my new blog post BTW
[2:50] <KodaichiZero> I am in favor of making Malikat's ban the official IRC topic.
[2:50] <Yourself> look at it this way: the ban has caused more frustration because now you have an agitated user
[2:50] <KodaichiZero> Who's with me?
[2:50] <Animator> No worries, Malikat.
[2:50] <Wervyn> Malikat: See, what you should have done was post questions that were absurdly difficult to answer instead of really easy, so that it was clear you were joking.
[2:50] <Yourself> <KodaichiZero> Yourself: you also believe it's possible to manage a userbase of 10,000+
[2:50] <Chezhead> So malikat got banned? Why?
[2:50] <Yourself> where did i ever say that?
[2:50] <KodaichiZero> you didn't
[2:50] <Yourself> and what makes you think i don't have experience with forums of that size?

[3:00] <Iguana> Fuuuu
[3:00] <Animator> DON'T HURT ME.
[3:00] <blaster> *nice
[3:00] <Quatroking> Yeah, it is.
[3:00] <Wervyn> So like, you have integers modulo 7, or {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}. If you take the number 3 and multiply it by itself, and then take it mod 7, you get 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9 = 2, 3^3 = 27 = 6, 3^4 = 81 = 4, 3^5 = 243 = 5, 3^6 = 729 = 1.

[3:06] <KodaichiZero> gonna play a flash game!
[3:06] <Yourself> i wonder if that guy ever finished the color list that he decided to clutter the development resources page with
[3:06] <KodaichiZero> escape the prison.
[3:06] <blaster> Page statistics Content pages 111
[3:06] <KodaichiZero> sounds kul
[3:06] <Yourself> or if he left it mostly unfinished so the article i spent so much time on looks like shit
[3:06] <Animator> Did you look through each and every page?
[3:06] <EmpiresBane> i think i might learn the wiki syntax sometime and just blow up the our wiki with an information overload
[3:06] <blaster> >.>
[3:06] <blaster> Does anyone know alot about map generation
[3:06] <Darkflux> It's been a while since I did the Number Theory subject I learnt that stuff in, and I don't think we even got as far as using elliptic curves for cryptography, only factorisation. But the maths wasn't too bad from memory, just the proofs :P

[3:07] <EmpiresBane> i just figured the basics to drawing an ellipse!
[3:07] <Yourself> i don't think numbers would be particularly helpful for understanding the map generation
[3:07] <EmpiresBane> by myself
[3:07] <Yourself> need the algorithm
[3:07] <Yourself> and the noise function that's apparently being used
[3:07] <blaster> Yes
[3:07] <Yourself> and how that noise function is used
[3:07] <blaster> Thats what I am on about
[3:07] <PureAdrenallen> So when is Notch gonna fix the water in infdev?
[3:07] <Yourself> after MP

[3:08] <Malikat> EmpiresBane the distance of point to focus 1 + point to focus 2 = constant
[3:09] <Yourself> Malikat, that's an ellipse
[3:09] <EmpiresBane> yeah.... but what's the formula for graphing it?
[3:09] <Yourself> they were talking about elliptic curves
[3:09] <Yourself> which is something else
[3:09] * mnjiman (Mibbit@d24-57-104-173.home.cgocable.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:09] <EmpiresBane> i'm talking about ellipses
[3:09] <Yourself> oh, you are talking about ellipses
[3:09] <Wervyn> Yeah. An elliptic curve is like, y^2 = x^3 + ax + b.
[3:09] <mnjiman> Ok I caved, im going to try Dwarf Fortress
[3:09] <blaster> I have noticed that people dont like using Red links on the wiki
[3:09] <blaster> Red links make it easier to see where stuff needs to be added
[3:10] <Yourself> x?/a? + y?/b? = 1
[3:10] <Yourself> for an ellipse centered at the origin
[3:10] <Malikat> isn't that a parabola?
[3:10] <Yourself> no
[3:10] <Schaap> no one likes to be told what to do
[3:10] <mnjiman> If anyone plays Dwarf Fortress can someone pm me and give me some advice lol

[3:10] <Malikat> when i read the description of an elliptic curve, i visualize a parabola. >:
[3:10] * Yourself rolls eyes
[3:10] <Schaap> i played that alot yesterday
[3:10] <Chezhead> Dwarf Fortress confuses me...

[3:10] <AndrewPH> go nuts
[3:10] <Schaap> found a tutorial
[3:10] <Wervyn> I never did get into that, too confusing.
[3:11] <Yourself> (x - h)?/a? + (y - k)?/b? = 1
[3:11] <SpaceManiac> What's happenin folks

[3:13] <Wervyn> And for some reason, no one was moving any of the barrels full of seeds inside. So to plant, the farmers would walk all the way outside, grab one seed, and walk all the way back inside.
[3:13] <Schaap> dont let an op see it
[3:13] <bildramer> what
[3:13] <Wervyn> Needless to say, everyone starved, before I figured out that "exclude barrels from plot" was on by default.
[3:14] <Wervyn> So yeah. Way too much management, menus, and obscure settings.
[3:14] <EmpiresBane> hurray for randomly changing numbers hoping the game will fix itself!!
[3:14] <bildramer> lol
[3:14] <bildramer> shotgun debugging ftw!
[3:15] <EmpiresBane> i didn't have my ADD medicine today, so proper debugging is out of the question

[3:31] <Schaap> like if you want your water level to rise 5 blocks
[3:32] <Visiiri> Or cheat engine.
[3:32] <EmpiresBane> can't do it IN-game
[3:32] <Visiiri> Unless you use cheat engine.
[3:32] <Schaap> do minus 5 at the bottom
[3:32] <EmpiresBane> except for maybe cheatengine
[3:32] <Schaap> and plus five in the air
[3:32] <Bjerre> ok
[3:32] <EmpiresBane> course, you'll have to know exactly what you're looking for
[3:32] <Bjerre> whats that cheatengine you talk about?
[3:32] <Visiiri> you just edit values
[3:32] <EmpiresBane> type it in google
[3:32] <Bjerre> okok
[3:32] <Schaap> some ram/network editor
[3:33] <Schaap> packet
[3:33] <Bjerre> so there is nothing like /water

[3:37] <Bjerre> green
[3:37] <vurtual> black
[3:37] <EmpiresBane> purple
[3:37] <Animator> I'm thinking a metallic sludge.
[3:37] <EmpiresBane> probably a bright blue
[3:38] <SubBoy> Prpbably brown
[3:38] <EmpiresBane> in an attempt to make things not look as bad as they are
[3:38] <Animator> I don't wanna do black, because then it'd blend too much with the rest of the skin and brown works.

[3:44] <Visiiri> K, guys, I need some advice.
[3:45] <Visiiri> I was planning to release two batch files to help with servers.

[3:45] <EmpiresBane> *fucked
[3:45] <Visiiri> Well, on my port forwarding .bat, I've come across aerrors
[3:45] <Visiiri> *errors
[3:45] <Bjerre> but why is notch creating the game by own? is it because of money or dont trust other ppl? :P
[3:46] <Visiiri> So I am considering switching to python.
[3:46] <Cial> he just is like that
[3:46] <Visiiri> It's sort of going both ways.
[3:46] <SubBoy> PRobably in line with "Because he can"
[3:46] <qizi2> because he's an artist, and this is his masterpiece
[3:46] <Cial> it gives him more control too
[3:46] <Visiiri> Noobs that can't port forward can't have python.
[3:46] <Visiiri> So, it might become useless.
[3:46] <Visiiri> What do you think?
[3:46] * Knuckx (danhemming@c-68-36-60-182.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:47] <qizi2> there are people who cant forward ports?

[3:47] <Visiiri> Ass loads of them
[3:47] <Animator> He just likes doing it alone.
[3:47] <ClassiestMedic> er
[3:47] <ClassiestMedic> in the corner of the http://www.mojang.com/live/ window
[3:47] <ClassiestMedic> it says on-air
[3:47] <ClassiestMedic> :D
[3:47] <Animator> Notch does the work of 10 men for Minecraft anyway.
[3:47] <EmpiresBane> but that's white

[3:47] <Animator> The more people that work with him, the lower the number gets, evidently.
[3:47] <Iguana> More like OVER 9000.
[3:48] <Bjerre> ok animator, but for how long has he been working on it? wouldnt take too long to finish it up if he got more help. But if I had his skills I wouldnt ask for help either
[3:48] <Schaap> The game.
[3:48] <Animator> Months.
[3:48] <Bjerre> only months?
[3:48] <Animator> Well, I dunno.
[3:48] <ExDee> I think so far it's been a yearish
[3:48] <Animator> I'd have to track down dates. Quatroking might know.
[3:48] <EmpiresBane> i thought he started in december?
[3:48] <mnjiman> imagine minecraft like a painting
[3:48] <mnjiman> people
[3:48] <EmpiresBane> or, public version in december
[3:48] <mnjiman> you have a view of what the end product will be
[3:48] <Visiiri> Notch is playing minecraft!
[3:49] <mnjiman> now if you have two people working on it,
[3:49] <mnjiman> their views may differ
[3:49] <Bjerre> true
[3:49] <Animator> Unless they're clones.
[3:49] <mnjiman> then there will be conflict,
[3:49] <mnjiman> OOOO
[3:49] <Animator> WE MUST CLONE NOTCH.
[3:49] <mnjiman> CLONE NOTCH!
[3:49] <EmpiresBane> no

[3:50] <Animator> SAVE NOTCH'S MIND ON A HARD DRIVE.
[3:50] <Cial> he gets to do a "your mom" joke
[3:50] <Animator> PRESERVE IT FOREVER.
[3:50] <SubBoy> Notch has a proto-minecraft youtube video dated 11 months ago, that useful?
[3:50] <Animator> RE-ENGINEER NOTCH 90 YEARS FROM NOW INTO MACHINE.
[3:50] <Animator> ENSLAVE MANKIND.
[3:51] <EmpiresBane> Animator, you're getting a little out of hand
[3:51] <Animator> REINACT GAME INTO REAL LIFE.
[3:51] <ExDee> and then finish minecraft
[3:51] <Animator> Yeah, that's a good ending.
[3:51] <mnjiman> Animator is going into a seizure
[3:52] <EmpiresBane> who's going to be able to ply it at that point?

[3:55] <vurtual> Just wait until we build a real life km-tall building that's really durable and light, but can hold alot.
[3:55] <killer2329> or hold over 2000 tons
[3:55] <vurtual> Then disney will build a gigantic km-tall tree model.

[3:59] <MC_fanatic> any&
[3:59] <MC_fanatic> Any*****
[3:59] <EmpiresBane> javascript is a web scripting language
[3:59] <EmpiresBane> so... if notch made a 3d game in it, he'd be god

[4:00] <Roujo> -dd +ss
[4:00] <Bjerre> well
[4:00] <EmpiresBane> MC_fanatic, it depends on how he programs it
[4:00] <Bjerre> question is
[4:01] <SubBoy> While *I* would of made it in C... I'm better at C, so his being better at java makes it better to program in java
[4:01] <Bjerre> is it possible to do this with c++`?
[4:01] <SubBoy> Oh, god yes.
[4:01] <Bjerre> ok
[4:01] <Roujo> Sure
[4:01] <EmpiresBane> yes
[4:01] <Bjerre> I've only used c++ a few times
[4:01] <Bjerre> never done anything with graphics though
[4:01] <ExDee> Didn't he work on wurm or something
[4:01] <EmpiresBane> java was designed to be an easier form of C++
[4:01] <SubBoy> Actualy, there are opengl and open al for C/C++ too
[4:01] <Bjerre> ok
[4:02] <SubBoy> There's probably a way to translate the code into C.... maybe. With some cleanup.
[4:02] <Bjerre> so everyone here is pro at programming?
[4:02] <EmpiresBane> no

[4:05] <IceFlinger> but crap
[4:05] <EmpiresBane> but that's a great idea

[4:48] <Fleur> Malikat: id win :D
[4:48] <Azathoth> ...doesn't look like anything
[4:48] <SubBoy> I don't fully subscribe to the idea that space itself did not previously exist, that's like saying there's aether.
[4:48] <Malikat> fleur you'd have like 20 lbs of mass that would then be at the center of
[4:48] <skywars> Yet the appeal of minecraft is unending
[4:48] <Malikat> the equivalent of 3 gigatons of TNT
[4:49] <SubBoy> Nice.
[4:49] <Fleur> how much is a gigaton
[4:49] <Fleur> O.lo
[4:49] <Azathoth> over 9000 tons
[4:49] <Fleur> mike rowe puts babies to sleep when he narates
[4:49] <qizi2> \1000 megatons
[4:49] <qizi2> so
[4:49] <qizi2> 100,000 tons?
[4:49] <Malikat> the biggest nuclear weapon EVER is the tsar bomba
[4:49] <Azathoth> 1000 megatons? i will nuke them all
[4:49] <Malikat> 100 megatons
[4:49] <Fleur> i wanna see what nothing looks like
[4:49] <Malikat> imagine 30 of those
[4:49] <Fleur> lol
[4:49] <skywars> Malikat: didnt that blow out windows like 300 miles away?
[4:49] <Fleur> what happens if you go in the nothing
[4:50] <Fleur> there can't possibly 'nothing' there has to be 'something'
[4:50] <SubBoy> In theory, the nothing is so far away, and moving so fast, you'd never catch it, but that's dodgy.
[4:50] <Malikat> skywars: the detonation was reduced to 50 megatons
[4:50] <IDTL> Well Fleur I know how to find out
[4:50] <IDTL> Go in a spaceship and fly there
[4:50] <IDTL> Oh wait
[4:50] <Fleur> smartass xD
[4:50] <Azathoth> it would be cool if the universe just looped around

[5:21] <vede> CruelNoise, actually, Xonotic.
[5:21] <CruelNoise> wat, they have a playtest out now? or whatever?
[5:21] <vede> It's just the git repo.
[5:21] <vede> I downloaded the source and compiled it myself.
[5:21] <CruelNoise> what does that mean?

[5:21] <CruelNoise> ahh
[5:22] <vede> They have the source code online, and they're using a system called Git to organize it. A Git repo is just the source code with some metadata so it's easy to update and recompile.
[5:23] <vurtual> I finally, just now, did the metroid prime 2 101% glitch.
[5:23] <vede> And thanks, CruelNoise!
[5:23] <vurtual> Sneaking past a cutscene, grabbing a new upgrade, and then using the cutscene, to get the same item twice.
[5:23] <vurtual> That means 1-2 upgrades are useless except for 100%, as I've already gotten the extra.

[5:29] <CruelNoise> so, vede, what exactly makes xonotic different from nexuiz, so far?
[5:30] <vede> So far, nothing.
[5:30] <CruelNoise> oh
[5:30] <vede> Except for the fact that there's no maps.
[5:30] <vede> And no textures.
[5:30] <CruelNoise> so what's the point?
[5:30] * fenixfurion gets nexuiz insteadf
[5:30] <vede> Well, I'm making textures/maps for Xonotic.
[5:31] <CruelNoise> what do you use to do that?
[5:31] <CruelNoise> and how is that different from nexuiz?
[5:31] <vede> NetRadiant for maps, GIMP for textures.
[5:31] <vede> It's not, CruelNoise. Xonotic is just a (still very, very young) fork of Nexuiz.
[5:31] <vede> In the beginning stages, they're going to be very similar.
[5:32] <CruelNoise> then why not do those things for the (already ageing) nexuiz?
[5:32] <Malikat> okay, the solution to my hunger issue
[5:32] <CruelNoise> eat
[5:32] <vede> And the point is that the people who are now working on Xonotic wanted to distance themselves from Nexuiz because of the huge dramarama with Illfonic.

[5:33] * Nyghtshade is now known as Nyght
[5:33] <CruelNoise> so, it;s being made for consoles, what;s the big deal, or, dramarama?
[5:34] <vede> The problem is that they now have the rights (copyright, no need to release source code, no more GPL, etc.) to everything that was Nexuiz.
[5:34] <CruelNoise> oh.
[5:34] <CruelNoise> that bad
[5:34] <vede> Yeah, it was basically Illfonic and the Nexuiz lead dev going to the community and then assraping them.
[5:34] <Malikat> could i get a rundown?

[5:38] <vede> Basically, the peeps in the Xonotic forums have agreed that Xonotic should be a sci-fi (ie. interplanetary sci-fi) shooter, so if someone makes a map that's set in ancient Egypt, it won't be accepted.

[5:39] <Animator> Had to be said.
[5:39] <vurtual> Ancient Egypt as created by another alien race, who had a fondness for the designs they were able to see via their advanced telescope?
[5:39] <Animator> How about Egypt in the future?
[5:39] <vurtual> So they end up creating a faintly Egyptian but alien city, with a massive telescope in the background.
[5:39] <Animator> With like, pyramids made of metal?

[5:41] <vede> So it'll probably look a lot more 'next-gen' then Nexuiz did.

[5:44] <Visiiri> I saw a pack of ~30 amish people
[5:44] <vurtual> It's like if you had some kind of logical automatic energy weapon, it'd bounce forever, turning a room into a deahtrap.
[5:44] <Visiiri> and a pimp.

[5:44] <vede> Another good thing about Xonotic, less obsession with goddamn ninjas.
[5:44] <vurtual> Plush trimmed suit and everything?
[5:44] <Animator> Pirates?
[5:44] <CruelNoise> what's wrong with nijas?
[5:45] <CruelNoise> and in my (addmittadly short) playtime, noone had mentioned ninjas ?
[5:45] <vede> Nothing wrong with ninjas, but Nexuiz has absolutely nothing to do with ninjas.
[5:45] <CruelNoise> so how is there an obsession/
[5:45] <vede> CruelNoise, it's a community thing. Pretty much *everywhere* but ingame, there's ninja crap all over the place.
[5:46] <vurtual> I wonder how long before we actually get automatic energy weapons.
[5:46] <CruelNoise> wow
[5:46] <vurtual> What kind of ninja? Solid-black-killer-type-with-health, or naruto kind?
[5:46] <vurtual> Or the more realistic PEASANT KIND

[6:28] <ClassiestMedic> jesus
[6:28] <vurtual> THEY COME UP FROM UNDER YOUR HOUSE

[6:29] <EmpiresBane> you know what's really scary?
[6:29] <Cial> is that a sarcastic best?
[6:29] <vurtual> Anyways, I recently noticed that metroid prime 2 starts about a few minutes before the entire setting would explode.
[6:29] <Cial> what?>

[6:30] <Cial> didnt all the prime games start with a 2 min timer?>
[6:30] <EmpiresBane> one of the engineers said that it should be built away from populated areas "just in case"
[6:30] <Cial> fun fun
[6:31] <EmpiresBane> when you're talking about making a 10km high super tornado your bitch, "just in case" isn't a good thing to be saying
[6:31] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[6:31] <Yourself> <EmpiresBane> one of the engineers said that it should be built away from populated areas "just in case"
[6:31] <Cial> kinda like working on a nuclear reactor and going whoops
[6:32] <Yourself> probably just in case one of the superconducting electromagnets failed and the beam of protons shot out of the ring and punched a hole through everything in its path
[6:32] <Yourself> a microscopic hole
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> once it's working, they want to give each city their own tornado
[6:32] <Yourself> but a hole
[6:32] <ClassiestMedic> wow
[6:32] <ClassiestMedic> scary
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> what do you mean?
[6:33] <Yourself> you're talking about the LHC, right?

[6:34] <Yourself> we need the energy
[6:35] <tons0phun> WE NEED VOLTRON
[6:35] <Cial> wouldnt making a tornado use a shit ton of energy?
[6:35] <Yourself> yes

[6:39] <Cial> sounds like an interesting theory

[6:39] <tons0phun> I think Popular Science had an article on it last year
[6:40] <Cial> "do i want a nuclear bomb in my back yard or a tornado?"
[6:40] <Yourself> what are you, a science journalist?
[6:41] <Yourself> "let's oversimplify things to the point that they sound horrible so that no one will like them"
[6:41] <vurtual> Cial, I'd prefer a nuclear reactor
[6:41] <vurtual> much more safe and less bomb-y
[6:42] <Cial> lol it was a joke about how people react to nuclear energy
[6:42] <vurtual> Choice: Salt, acidic food
[6:42] <Bomb_Spammer> I want a bomb
[6:42] <Bomb_Spammer> A tornado rips your house up by proximity
[6:42] <Bomb_Spammer> A bomb has to detonate
[6:42] <Cial> move to Megaton
[6:42] <vurtual> Do I want something poisonous that explodes when touched by water, or acid?
[6:42] <vurtual> hmmm
[6:42] <Cial> acid is less likely to be in your yard
[6:43] <vurtual> Also, apparently, in some star wars space combat games, you can beat the game in one mission.
[6:43] <vurtual> Say, you have to destroy a massive star destroyer, with some massive sneaky plot to do so? A REAL PILOT can just engage the star destroyer from an X-Wing and take it out himself.
[6:43] <vurtual> Then win every medal, ever.

[6:53] <Malikat> don't kill my ruins. i put effort into making the moss look mossy
[6:53] <Yourself> grading curves are evil
[6:53] <EmpiresBane> also, someone must wash those phonebooths
[6:53] <Yourself> if everyone does the work and demonstrates that they've learned what they're supposed to, they all should get A's
[6:54] <eritz_L> C is defined as 'Average'
[6:54] <eritz_L> B and A are 'above average'
[6:54] <eritz_L> by definition, everybody cannot be above average
[6:54] <Yourself> you don't artificially slide down those who did marginally worse just to preserve some sort arbitrary definition of what the letters mean
[6:54] <EmpiresBane> it's true, even though that's not what they are
[6:55] <EmpiresBane> Yourself, the letters were chosen for grading curve
[6:55] <EmpiresBane> get a new system if you want something else

[6:55] <SubBoy> Don't know where YOU are from, but around here, letter grades are tied directly to numerical values for correctness. And so if you are infact, 100% correct within the context, you should get an A, and it's possible for everyone to be 100% correct (in context)
[6:55] <Yourself> that practice is universally frowned upon

[6:58] <Legolord> soice
[6:58] <Scrippy> I find the majority of the sources that I use on papers on Wikipedia.
[6:58] <SubBoy> Just saying grading papers on a curve just cause they're papers is silly. And also that most papers are silly.
[6:59] <Yourself> grading anything on a curve is silly
[6:59] <SubBoy> WEll yes, that too.
[6:59] <tons0phun> not true
[6:59] <eritz_L> y'all mad
[6:59] <tons0phun> some times a curve is necessary
[6:59] <Scrippy> Grading things on a curve makes sense.
[6:59] <tons0phun> take for example a predicament I fell into:
[6:59] <SubBoy> Why is a curve nessisary? Should not the scale be accurate to it's objective from the start?
[6:59] * Dandistine is now known as Dandistine_afk
[6:59] <Scrippy> That's not always possible?
[6:59] <SubBoy> When?
[6:59] <tons0phun> one of my classes, Fluid Dynamics, is being taught by a part-time faculty graduate student
[6:59] <Yourself> grading on a curve means you're graded on relative performance
[6:59] <tons0phun> and it is his first time teaching the course
[7:00] <Scrippy> If there's a new teacher.
[7:00] <eritz_L> "Hey guys, let's let everybody be above average, even though it's statistically impossible!"
[7:00] <Yourself> not absolute performance
[7:00] <eritz_L> "Sure, we'll destroy the concept of averages in the process, but who cares?!"
[7:00] <tons0phun> the first example he gave us had scores that created a normal-distribution
[7:00] <Scrippy> Well, most of my teachers only grade on a curve if most of the scores are below average.
[7:00] <tons0phun> however, the class average sat over 50%
[7:00] <Scrippy> And even then it just moves the average up to a C.
[7:00] <tons0phun> with the highest score being an 80%
[7:00] <Scrippy> Which is
[7:00] <Scrippy> Average.
[7:00] <tons0phun> 50% is failing
[7:01] <tons0phun> for most teachers, 60% is also failing
[7:01] <Norend> bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon bacon
[7:01] <tons0phun> so by curving it, it rates the class comparatively to one another in their performance
[7:01] <SubBoy> In those cases, have a more able educator adjust the grading scale, instead of just doing it on a curve.
[7:01] <Yourself> the problem with a curve is everyone could score within one point of one another and the curve would put half of them below C and the other half above
[7:01] <SubBoy> BEcvause it is entirely possible that the entire class slacked off.
[7:01] <EmpiresBane> Yourself, it's different in that case
[7:02] <Scrippy> Yeah, that's be biggest problems with curves.
[7:02] <tons0phun> more like it's this teacher's first time teaching the subject, and he's part-time, and he's only a grad-student
[7:02] <EmpiresBane> i don't think you guys realize how it works
[7:02] <EmpiresBane> it's still up to the teacher in the end
[7:02] <Yourself> i realize exactly how a normal distribution works
[7:02] <Legolord> I need a name for my blog
[7:02] <Scrippy> Me too.
[7:02] <Scrippy> Statistics classes, etc
[7:02] <Yourself> IQs are done on a normal distribution
[7:02] <EmpiresBane> it's not a set in stome mathematical formula
[7:02] <Scrippy> (It was graded on a curve, too)
[7:02] <Yourself> and it makes sense in that case because it's supposed to be a ranking relative to everyone else
[7:03] <EmpiresBane> it's a guiding line for the teacher
[7:03] <Yourself> grades in classes shouldn't be

[7:04] <Legolord> to a point
[7:04] <Zaneo> it's like falling sand 3.0
[7:05] <Yourself> nice hustle, tons o' fun, next time try a salad
[7:05] <Legolord> falling sand 3.0...?
[7:05] <tons0phun> Bodie; take the cobblestone, and heat it in the furnace
[7:05] <Legolord> brb
[7:05] <Codlike> Bodie, put it in the furnace and cook it
[7:05] <Bodie> sweet
[7:05] <Scrippy> Why would you bother?
[7:05] <Scrippy> I just use cobblestone...
[7:05] <EmpiresBane> can you bring it back?
[7:05] <EmpiresBane> asheatics
[7:05] <Bodie> you bother if you want your castle looking pretty
[7:05] <tons0phun> indeed
[7:05] <SubBoy> Isn't stone more resistant to TNT/creepers?
[7:05] <EmpiresBane> that was terrible spelling...
[7:06] <EmpiresBane> more resistant than dirt
[7:06] <tons0phun> oooh, I need to test TNT on Diamond blocks
[7:06] <commie> stone is semi resistant
[7:06] <tons0phun> after reading that "TNT Science" thread
[7:06] <tons0phun> I made a TNT cannon, with a steel barrel
[7:06] <Scrippy> True this...
[7:06] <SubBoy> Rather, isn't stone better than cobblestone?
[7:06] <EmpiresBane> test it on iron and gold too
[7:06] <commie> honestly dont rely on TNT resistant stuff for walls
[7:06] * jonnyabc is now known as jonnyabc|shower
[7:06] <tons0phun> the cannon did not survive the test. :/
[7:06] <commie> if someone wants in they'll get in
[7:06] <EmpiresBane> tnt cannon?
[7:06] <tons0phun> yes, TnT Cannon
[7:06] <commie> tnt, pick, undermining, or ladder
[7:07] <EmpiresBane> commie, it's ofr creepers
[7:07] <commie> fil lyour walls with sand
[7:07] <SubBoy> TNT is more accurate than TnT though.
[7:07] <Scrippy> Is there any way to take a minecraft screenshot other than prntscrn?
[7:07] <tons0phun> I thought that the steel would hold up, but the TNT vaporized it

[7:08] <SubBoy> WEll, it keeps their spawn far enough for them to not track you, ideally.
[7:08] <EmpiresBane> and explosion resistance
[7:08] <Scrippy> Hmm
[7:08] <Darkfire002> easy easy way to beat them all.
[7:08] <commie> put them so far out they wont spanw near enough to home in

[7:09] <EmpiresBane> maybe gold walls
[7:09] <EmpiresBane> or iron
[7:09] <Cial> im with Darkfire on that
[7:09] <Darkfire002> why put iron or anything in ur wall?

[7:09] <ClassiestMedic> ftw

[7:10] <ClassiestMedic> it is though
[7:10] <Darkfire002> everyone listen to me
[7:10] <tons0phun> I wish Minecraft had spears
[7:10] <commie> sand trakes longer to destroy cuz of gravity
[7:10] <Darkfire002> dig out ur floor
[7:10] <Darkfire002> at night
[7:10] <tons0phun> that you could melee with, and throw
[7:10] <ClassiestMedic> why?
[7:10] <Darkfire002> put a 1 block hole in the glass
[7:10] <Darkfire002> but at their feet level
[7:10] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[7:10] <commie> everyone does that
[7:10] <Darkfire002> then only spiders are able to hit u

[7:10] <commie> its gonna be nerfed
[7:10] <ClassiestMedic> :D
[7:10] <Cial> tons0phun i would like to melee with spears too

[7:28] <Hatred> They look nice but they're a pain
[7:28] <Scrippy> Use fure.
[7:28] <Scrippy> Fire fire fire.
[7:28] <Eztuzt> Better yet
[7:28] <Eztuzt> USE LAVA
[7:28] <SubBoy> Fire. CAREFULLY

[7:28] <Eztuzt> USE LAVA HAPHAZARDLY!
[7:28] <Legolord> <Eztuzt>: They have so much wood
[7:28] <Legolord> LOL
[7:28] <Scrippy> I accidentally burned my entire treehouse down.
[7:29] <Hatred> If I find some materials for fire, I'll do it
[7:29] <Scrippy> It was five new trees tall
[7:29] <cynicalAlchemist> Do you get tree saplings from burning down a tree?
[7:29] <Hatred> I have yet to find anything beyond coal.
[7:29] <Scrippy> I was using controlled demolition but alas, no longer D=
[7:29] <Scrippy> nope.
[7:29] <Eztuzt> You dont need coal when you have lava
[7:29] <Eztuzt> Use. Lava,
[7:29] <Eztuzt> With no regard or care for your safety
[7:29] <Scrippy> How do you use lava anywho?
[7:29] <Scrippy> Can you carry it?
[7:29] <Eztuzt> Lava cures everything, especially life
[7:29] <Eztuzt> No, you drink it
[7:29] <Eztuzt> And run around
[7:29] <vurtual> Ironically that's how forests keep going very well.
[7:29] <Scrippy> I wish you could.
[7:29] <Neo160> lol
[7:29] <Hatred> Ugh. I'm scrapping my currently InfDev world and starting over
[7:29] <vurtual> They burn down, then saplings grow.
[7:30] <Scrippy> I miss caves too.
[7:30] <Eztuzt> Saplings left on teh ground should sprout new trees
[7:30] <Codlike> trees regrow through leaves
[7:30] * Liam is now known as Liam|Zzz
[7:30] <Codlike> so you dont have to remove them all
[7:30] <Legolord> Im one for retardedly huge projects
[7:30] <Hatred> Yeah, caves made me happy, until I stumbled on a few creepers >.>;
[7:30] <Scrippy> Hee
[7:30] <cynicalAlchemist> Also, wouldn't it be nice if you could build a furnace near lava and you won't need coal or wood?
[7:30] <Eztuzt> I was once in this cave
[7:30] <Scrippy> That would be awesome.
[7:30] <Eztuzt> I saw a lava pool, about 30 blocks udner me
[7:30] <Eztuzt> A few ceepers walked out
[7:30] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[7:30] <Legolord> Cynical: play DF
[7:30] <cynicalAlchemist> Lego: I do
[7:30] <Eztuzt> One pulled out a bag full of ground up weed, and the other pulled out a gun
[7:30] <ClassiestMedic> xD
[7:30] <Legolord> W00t
[7:30] <Eztuzt> I watched from above and they spotted me
[7:31] <Legolord> MagmaSmelters
[7:31] <ClassiestMedic> They shot at you?
[7:31] <Eztuzt> So, they dropped their stuff and one creeper got on the other
[7:31] <ClassiestMedic> Humpage?
[7:31] <Eztuzt> The creeper on teh bottom exploded, and the other started sizzling as it flew towards me

[7:31] <Eztuzt> It exploded on teh ground under me, and I was propelled into the lake of lava
[7:31] <Legolord> I hate when that happens!
[7:31] <Eztuzt> Lego has experience with this.
[7:32] <Legolord> numerous times
[7:32] <Eztuzt> Except with castles and gigantic gorges

[7:32] <Eztuzt> They held them and suicidally launched them at my fort
[7:32] <Legolord> too easy to dodge arrows on hard

[7:33] <vurtual> nightmare, duh
[7:33] <Legolord> creepers are hilariously terrifying
[7:33] <Neo160> does difficulty effect spawning rate for monsters? on my map, they spawn slooow
[7:33] <[JD]> the free versions of minecraft (not indev/infdev) will eventually gain the features like farming and such as indev progresses, right? (my friend wants to know :P)
[7:33] <Eztuzt> well
[7:33] <vurtual> Minecraft needs hillarious, blocky gore.
[7:33] <ClassiestMedic> yes
[7:33] <ClassiestMedic> Easy is few monsters
[7:33] <vurtual> [JD], no.

[7:33] <ClassiestMedic> Hard a lot of 'em
[7:33] <Neo160> ah, thx
[7:33] <Legolord> I want enemies to spawn occasionally, if possible, in a controlled manner
[7:34] <Eztuzt> [JD] I remember seeing that there will be a demo, so yes
[7:34] <Legolord> lol
[7:34] <[JD]> i know eventually everything is planned to be open source :P but my friend was curious about more recent updates
[7:34] <Eztuzt> But it wont be permanant for them
[7:34] <Neo160> i just recently bought the game XD
[7:34] <Eztuzt> Lucky you
[7:34] <vurtual> Open source in say, a few years
[7:34] <vurtual> upon years
[7:34] <[JD]> yeah
[7:34] <[JD]> :P
[7:34] <vurtual> or a few decades
[7:34] <Eztuzt> When beta comes out, price goes from 15 to 30
[7:34] <vurtual> I made an amazing looking mini-lift in hammer

[7:34] <Eztuzt> Ive been a member since..... early october or mid-late august
[7:34] <vurtual> Modding in some kind of scan visor wouldn't work.
[7:34] <Legolord> on the lift..?
[7:34] <Eztuzt> I dont remember :P
[7:35] <[JD]> ok thanks for the infos guys
[7:35] <[JD]> =D
[7:35] <Eztuzt> Np
[7:35] <cynicalAlchemist> Do you guys know where I can find gravel? I can only seem to find sand so far.
[7:35] <MarkTraceur> Scrippy: HUGE.
[7:35] <Eztuzt> \Drop by here a bit more
[7:35] <vurtual> The shape's basically a ,_, shape, distorted a bit in the middle of the sides to fit on rails.
[7:35] * blinky (Mibbit@67.sub-75-250-6.myvzw.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[7:35] <Legolord> toggle it via console, have buttons on each point firing that command
[7:35] <Scrippy> MarkTraceur: Yessir.
[7:35] <vurtual> Oh hey I can magically control it with my use key.
[7:35] <Zaneo> scrippy i am always making mine bigger
[7:35] <vurtual> brb setting it up for that.
[7:35] <Eztuzt> Cynical: I havent found any yet, but try digging under sand or exploring along coasts
[7:35] <Scrippy> Also cynical, just keep walking.
[7:36] <Scrippy> I've never found any under sand
[7:36] <Eztuzt> And walking.
[7:36] <Legolord> <Zaneo>: scrippy i am always making mine bigger
[7:36] <vurtual> or I can just try a holographic panel

[7:36] <Scrippy> MarkTraceur: Well it's going to be a well-lit cave-entrance pit mine independent from my spire
[7:36] <Eztuzt> Thets moxy, and youve got it kid
[7:37] <Zaneo> I made a forest
[7:37] <Legolord> I found diamonds on a rock outcrop in indev a while back, ~2 weeks ago
[7:37] <Scrippy> I just need large amounts of stone for the spire
[7:37] <Zaneo> i walk ontop of it to get to places
[7:37] <Scrippy> I have never found diamonds in infdev

[7:38] <Eztuzt> New discussion: Notch should add support in a .txt file that allows for custom rocks, like in dwarf fortress
[7:38] <MarkTraceur> Eztuzt: I was just thinking how it would be awesome to have conveyor belts.....

[7:38] <Scrippy> MarkTraceur: You found a water cave?
[7:38] <Eztuzt> For them to be..proper
[7:38] <Scrippy> Also fuck year con veyor belts.
[7:38] <Scrippy> I want them so bad.
[7:38] <MarkTraceur> Scrippy: Several, actually. I wound up draining them into each other....

[7:39] <Eztuzt> New clothing, materials, etc

[7:39] <Scrippy> Rubber trees wouldn't be that hard to implement
[7:39] <Eztuzt> Well have gears
[7:39] <eritz_L> imagine the traps you could make with conveyor belts
[7:39] <Eztuzt> Notch already put them in to show us a few months back
[7:39] <Scrippy> Heee
[7:39] <Zaneo> i think a ladder block would be cool
[7:39] <Eztuzt> He just needs a use for em
[7:39] <ClassiestMedic> I agree
[7:39] <MarkTraceur> Oooh, good idea Zaneo
[7:39] <cynicalAlchemist> Yay, gravel
[7:39] <eritz_L> i think notch hates ladders
[7:39] <Scrippy> Conveyor belts!
[7:39] <Eztuzt> Cial said ladders were on the no go list
[7:39] <vurtual> yeah
[7:39] <MarkTraceur> Aw, lame
[7:39] <Eztuzt> Id rather ropes
[7:39] <vurtual> counter-strike made him scared of ladders
[7:39] <Eztuzt> And it will be my rope tower, 5x5x250
[7:39] <vurtual> not the cool hl2 ones either
[7:40] <Zaneo> ropes would be cool
[7:40] <MarkTraceur> Hahaha, good point
[7:40] <vurtual> on rails
[7:40] <eritz_L> elevators, on the other hand...
[7:40] <Scrippy> Ropes would basically be ladders.

[7:40] <Scrippy> I can imagine elevators being crazy hard to make.
[7:40] <Eztuzt> But easier to design(?)
[7:40] <Zaneo> Elevators might be hard to make yeah
[7:40] <MarkTraceur> Well, with an engine/gears, you could do it
[7:40] <eritz_L> ropes should be spelunky-style
[7:40] <Eztuzt> Yeah
[7:40] <Eztuzt> Like shooting an arrow, expect where it lands it tracks the nearest block and lets down a rope
[7:41] <Eztuzt> From said block
[7:41] <Fenix393> if he gives us buckets we can make ladders and elevators
[7:41] <Eztuzt> Then climbing is like climbing up a watervator
[7:41] <Wervyn> Thief-style rope arrows?
[7:41] <Eztuzt> No. Ninja style rope arrows.
[7:41] <cynicalAlchemist> Yay flint. I can finally complete my light house.
[7:41] <vurtual> opposing force ropes :(
[7:41] <Eztuzt> Anyway
[7:41] <Eztuzt> As i said before
[7:41] <Wervyn> What, exactly, is the difference, or are you just someone who's never played Thief?

[8:07] <Scrippy> I love caves, and caves make it way easier to find minerals.
[8:07] <Scrippy> I have to resort to strip mining.
[8:07] <MarkTraceur> No, that's good....that way you don't happen upon a cave and get monsters running out at you
[8:07] <Scrippy> Well
[8:07] <Scrippy> I prefer them
[8:08] <MarkTraceur> It still spawns water and lava, right?
[8:08] <Scrippy> Also no mushrooms, and mushrooms are my main means of sustenance
[8:08] <Scrippy> Not really
[8:08] <Visiiri> question party ftw
[8:08] <Scrippy> No water or lava caves
[8:08] <MarkTraceur> Haha, food
[8:08] <Scrippy> But there is still lava at the bottom
[8:08] <Bodie> caves are awesome
[8:08] <MarkTraceur> Ah, K
[8:08] <Bodie> they will be in it though
[8:08] <Bodie> right?
[8:08] <Scrippy> Yes
[8:08] <Scrippy> But not until the Beta comes out
[8:08] <MarkTraceur> Man, my food stash is whatever amount of meat I have cooked, and a box and a half of bread
[8:08] <Scrippy> Which should be very soon i think.
[8:08] <Scrippy> How do you farm by the way?
[8:08] <Scrippy> I never tried.
[8:09] <MarkTraceur> Oh
[8:09] <MarkTraceur> Make a hoe
[8:09] <Scrippy> But now without mushrooms I may need to.
[8:09] <MarkTraceur> With it, right click on grassy ground
[8:09] <Scrippy> Arg I live in the middle of a lake
[8:09] <MarkTraceur> Every once in a while, you'll get seeds
[8:09] <paz> thats good
[8:09] <paz> u need wate
[8:09] <paz> r
[8:09] <Scrippy> Do you have to irrigate the ground?
[8:09] <MarkTraceur> You need to till the ground (right click with the hoe on any dirt) and then right-click with the seeds to plant them

[8:29] <Visiiri> I do Your mom jokes all the time

[8:29] <vurtual> Similarly, a single dirty joke is bad.
[8:29] <Visiiri> ohhhhhh
[8:29] <vurtual> But, a dirty discussion that's ten times worse, at least, is generally in the clear.
[8:29] <Cial> also i censored that rant alot
[8:29] * Fleur is sad and goes to the corner of sadness
[8:29] <vurtual> Also a pirating reference=bad, but then there's alot of warez-sharing and nobody bats an eye.
[8:30] <vurtual> Are we being TOO good?
[8:30] <eritz_L> from what i've seen, talk about pirating minecraft, and get banned
[8:30] <vurtual> one pirating joke about anything
[8:30] <eritz_L> talk about pirating anything else, and nobody seems to care
[8:30] <vurtual> but warez links are ignored
[8:30] <Visiiri> How can you pirate minecraft?

[8:31] <Visiiri> I'm so confused.
[8:31] <Visiiri> I didn't think it was possible
[8:31] <vurtual> at least one time you could actually just download the game jars from minecraft.net
[8:32] <Visiiri> ROFLMAO
[8:32] <Visiiri> vurtual is right
[8:32] <vurtual> Also, when I realised that I have the exact mathematical values for my elevator already here, and it's built to force itself into being precisely on time, I can just do basic math
[8:32] <Visiiri> the question was "Where do you live"
[8:32] <Visiiri> the answer I put: dick
[8:32] <vurtual> and then make doors open on time delay

[8:33] <LG_Legacy> funfact
[8:33] <LG_Legacy> There technically is a indev client
[8:33] <LG_Legacy> Just not a infdev
[8:33] <Visiiri> Yes sir.
[8:33] <Visiiri> Standalone.
[8:33] <Fleur> technically :/
[8:33] <Visiiri> And it works with infdev perfectly.
[8:33] <LG_Legacy> Oh i bet it does
[8:33] <Visiiri> Except downloading.
[8:33] <Fleur> doesnt it check to make sure the person actually paid for the game
[8:33] <Visiiri> You have to change a few things for that.
[8:34] <LG_Legacy> It does
[8:34] <Visiiri> yes
[8:34] <Marafk-05> it does
[8:34] <Cial> you have to put in you usename/password
[8:34] <vurtual> return YES
[8:34] <LG_Legacy> I bet theres a way to remove it but still
[8:34] <Marafk-05> it just doesn't check if it's running on the website
[8:34] <vurtual> basically someone can packetsniff, and determine how it's supposed to respond
[8:34] <Fleur> id like the client xD i hate using firefox that long
[8:34] <vurtual> then, redirect the jar to listen to the client
[8:34] <vurtual> and pretend that's the internet
[8:34] <Cial> i still wish i could load a indev map offline with out the game fucking up
[8:34] <Marafk-05> vurtual: possible
[8:34] <vurtual> Then the client could have a nice server brwoser

[9:12] <Christoph> I'd wager there are better ones.

[9:12] <vurtual> or ironically, gml, if you aren't exactly capible of jumping in.
[9:12] <Christoph> I too have heard luxurious things about python.
[9:12] <SubBoy> Oo, oo, I change my answer to scheme.
[9:12] <Hunter712> subhazard, HTML

[9:13] <IDTL> I appear to have been kicked

[9:15] <SubBoy> The problem with C you might consider is if you want to program for a lot of different platforms, but want to not deal with portability yourself.
[9:15] <Subhazard> Can someone please point me in the direction of a guide to start out with?
[9:15] <vurtual> google
[9:16] <vurtual> It's programming law.
[9:16] <Subhazard> No, I wouldn't know what to search for.

[9:18] <Fleur> LuciferZ: I said snuggle not buttsex
[9:18] <Christoph> I think I would most likely pay for that guide if it was in print.
[9:18] <SubBoy> Though the logical answer then is to refine your question..

[9:22] <Scrippy> I can't seem to get the rotation right.
[9:22] <Cial> Subhazard Notepad++ is ok for alot of languages
[9:22] <Subhazard> You know.
[9:22] <Subhazard> A lesson plan would be really cool
[9:22] <Subhazard> Like
[9:22] <Christoph> Some languages provide those for free, but others only give you bs free trials.
[9:22] <Luingar> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119174/
[9:22] <Subhazard> 'Open up Notepad++, now do this, note how this does this when you do this, okay this should be the result, now do this'
[9:22] <Luingar> that shit right there is mean
[9:23] <Christoph> Luingar.
[9:23] <Luingar> aye?
[9:23] <Christoph> You dirty rat.
[9:23] <Luingar> you've lost the game
[9:23] <Christoph> You dirty, stinking, feces encrusted filthy little rat.
[9:23] <Luingar> XD
[9:23] <Christoph> Nice job, man.
[9:23] <Christoph> Sort of.
[9:23] <Subhazard> Okay
[9:23] <Subhazard> So
[9:23] <Subhazard> I need to download Notepad++?
[9:23] <Luingar> unexpected obscure reference ftw
[9:23] <Subhazard> Subboy, meet me in query.
[9:24] <eritz_L> yeah, that was pretty good
[9:24] <Christoph> Actually, that looks like an interesting movie.
[9:24] <Subhazard> When will the meme go away?
[9:24] <Subhazard> It's so lame and boring.
[9:24] <Luingar> it's actually quite amusing
[9:25] <Scrippy> Baww nobody will tell me how to build a rotating spire.
[9:25] <Luingar> it has it's moments anyways
[9:25] <Christoph> Wow, what? It's even in the Tag line...
[9:25] <Luingar> scrippy, that's cause it's not possible
[9:25] <Luingar> hah
[9:25] <Luingar> it is
[9:25] <SubBoy> Sure thing
[9:25] <Luingar> >.<
[9:25] <Scrippy> I'm pretty sure it is.
[9:25] <Christoph> You have a choice of dimensions.
[9:25] <Subhazard> The only things that can move in minecraft are entities.
[9:25] <Scrippy> But It is beyond me right now.
[9:25] <Subhazard> Blocks cannot move.
[9:25] <Subhazard> They can only... er.. teleport.
[9:25] <Subhazard> Like sand.
[9:25] <Scrippy> I mean rotating as in twisting.
[9:25] <Subhazard> Okay
[9:26] <Christoph> Yes...
[9:26] <Subhazard> So say twisting you idiot.
[9:26] <Scrippy> Not actually moving.
[9:26] <Christoph> What's hard about that?
[9:26] <Subhazard> Rotating implies movement.
[9:26] <Scrippy> Rotating and twisting are synonymous in this context.
[9:26] <Luingar> ergo, it's not possible
[9:26] <Christoph> So... what's the problem?
[9:26] <Luingar> just, trust us on this. what your asking for isn't possible
[9:27] <Scrippy> Derp.

[9:28] <Luingar> ...
[9:28] <Luingar> i just had an awsome idea
[9:29] <Luingar> i wanna tame creepers
[9:29] <Luingar> and make them carry a platform made of tnt
[9:29] <Christoph> For their milk? It's probably like 300 proof.
[9:29] <Luingar> and put somebody i don't like on it
[9:29] <Luingar> so they'll look like an emporer
[9:29] <vurtual> I have no idea what came over me, but I decided to make my sci-fi ships by manually clipping brushes into polygonal shapes.
[9:30] <Luingar> until they explode anyways
[9:30] <vurtual> Result is an awesome hovertank
[9:30] <Luingar> ...
[9:30] <Luingar> which isn't a good thing
[9:30] <Christoph> Hmm.
[9:30] <Christoph> Soo...
[9:30] <Christoph> A large mag train.
[9:30] <Christoph> With creepers who carry it on their heads...
[9:30] <Luingar> yes

[9:32] <Scrippy> Farming creepers for fun and profit?
[9:32] <TrueWolves> Minecraft RTS
[9:32] <Christoph> And you steer it by hitting the creepers with raw pork in order to get them to walk the direction you want.
[9:32] <Scrippy> I like it.
[9:33] <Christoph> If custom-built vehicles DO get added, the RTS aspect will be close.

[9:34] <Christoph> Huge, terrible machines, powered by the souls of skeletons and containing several thousand trapped creepers each.
[9:35] <Luingar> while i speed in there and steal shit using a sled powered by spiders
[9:35] * Christoph 's eyes glaze over.
[9:35] <vurtual> custom-modelled polygon vehicles would be wonderful in minecraft.
[9:35] <Christoph> Notch did mention logic gates.

[9:36] <Christoph> If there are switches.
[9:36] <Christoph> Perhaps he could create wheel blocks?
[9:36] <Luingar> rock.
[9:36] <Christoph> Or entities....
[9:36] <Luingar> i detect the creation of a bus
[9:36] <Luingar> filled with griefers with bows
[9:37] <Luingar> and chests
[9:37] <Christoph> And then you could attach a steering lever to each.
[9:37] <Christoph> Aye, and fill it with chests.
[9:37] <Christoph> Roaming bandits and merchants carrying things to each town on infdev.
[9:37] <Luingar> but little do they know that there's a line of tnt running down the middle
[9:37] <Luingar> rock
[9:37] <Scrippy> Logic gates?
[9:37] <LuciferZ> Carts are planned.
[9:37] <LuciferZ> Mobile chests.
[9:37] <Luingar> really hope notch adds money
[9:37] <Luingar> i can't imagine what else gold would be good for
[9:38] <Scrippy> I think it'll be a barter system.
[9:38] <LuciferZ> Enchanting tools and such
[9:38] <Scrippy> I like that better anyway.
[9:38] <Christoph> It would also be interesting to be able to change the difficulty in each area.
[9:38] <Christoph> Money is irritating.
[9:38] <Christoph> Goods and services all the way.
[9:38] <Scrippy> Hell yes.
[9:38] <LuciferZ> Yeah, I agree.
[9:38] <Christoph> Gold IS useless right now, though.
[9:38] <Scrippy> A diamond sword if you help me fortify my skybase.
[9:39] <Scrippy> It'll probably be for decoration of some sort.
[9:39] <Christoph> Perhaps if it was used to make gears/machinery.
[9:39] <Scrippy> Crowns, etc.
[9:39] <Luingar> http://tinyurl.com/2crjcz6 guess what that is?
[9:39] <Scrippy> Although I expect I will be a mostly utilitarian hardass.
[9:39] <Christoph> A microscopic pic?
[9:39] <Luingar> that's JIZZ :D
[9:40] <Scrippy> Looks like sperm
[9:40] <Scrippy> Yup.
[9:40] <Luingar> lawl, cum joke
[9:40] <Christoph> Hm. Imagine that.
[9:40] <Luingar> yeah, that's semen developing in the testicals
[9:40] <Luingar> actually pretty interesting
[9:40] <Christoph> I heard about a cancer that spreads between Tazmanian Devils on contact today.
[9:40] <LuciferZ> if you like penis
[9:40] * Luingar likes penis
[9:40] <LuciferZ> I know, lol
[9:40] <Christoph> It's an infectious tumor.
[9:40] <Luingar> wonder what those little things are?
[9:41] <LuciferZ> That's just about the worst thing possible, Christoph
[9:41] <LuciferZ> Nuke it from orbit
[9:41] <Christoph> It's just dumb luck that it works.
[9:41] <vurtual> I agree
[9:41] <vurtual> nuke it
[9:41] <Luingar> lol
[9:41] <vurtual> I find it funny that I can make a sadistic trap for players who want to use my elevator.
[9:41] <Christoph> It has some perfect evolutionary advantages.
[9:41] <LuciferZ> Is it nuke proof?
[9:41] <vurtual> The elevator can move up 128 units, becoming essentially the ceiling
[9:41] <Christoph> The devil's bite each other, the tumors flake off like feta cheese, and get into the wounds.
[9:41] <TestDummy> vurtual: Elevator? I hardly know 'er!
[9:42] <vurtual> Then, a hunter jumps you from behind, and can shoot/attack you, and will either smack you down, make you slip down, suicide down, or smack you forward, into the shaft.
[9:42] <Christoph> And because the Devil's are inbred, they have no genetic variance, so their immune systems don't recognize the tumors as threats.

[9:42] <vurtual> If you do, somehow, not fall, you will be violently and slowly molested and raped by hunter attacks, like Alyx was.
[9:43] <Christoph> They also mentioned on the report another similar disease that dog's have had since the dawn of time.

[9:43] <vurtual> Also, funny, telling the elevator(intentionally or not) to go illogical directions.
[9:43] <Christoph> It was on NPR.
[9:43] <vurtual> Like magically down a hallway, or into walls.
[9:43] <Christoph> I sat in my driveway listening to it.
[9:43] <vurtual> Or at a slight angle, so you're killed by it
[9:43] <Christoph> And felt like a tool.
[9:43] <LuciferZ> Vurtual, you're getting predictable
[9:44] <Christoph> That reminds me of the Gary's Mod traps, vurtual.
[9:44] <LuciferZ> This is the thrid time you've rambled about elevators now.
[9:44] <Luingar> wanna hear a joke?
[9:44] <Luingar> your life.
[9:44] <LuciferZ> Dohoho
[9:44] <vurtual> I've spent all day working on an elevator.
[9:44] <LuciferZ> It's so true

[9:52] <Christoph> I just found the thread about the Adderator on the forum.
[9:52] <Christoph> That is just absurd.
[9:52] <vurtual> You're jumping from pillar to pillar, until water begins filling up
[9:52] <vurtual> which makes the pillars sink down 50%, in the deep room
[9:52] <MarkTraceur> Christoph: Link?
[9:52] <vurtual> So you start falling, but the water filling the room fills over 50% before you hit the ground
[9:53] <Christoph> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=6315&start=0&hilit=adderator
[9:53] <Christoph> Over 100 hours making it.

[9:53] <vurtual> Then, you're floating in the water, and swimming around
[9:53] <Christoph> And I bet it functions perfectly.
[9:53] <vurtual> Cue shark boss you can't speed around
[9:53] <Christoph> Some people are just too smart.
[9:53] <vurtual> I want platform blocks
[9:54] <vurtual> That are half-entity, in that a length of them is stored as one unit with a size, and they need solid blocks supporting them on each side.
[9:54] <Christoph> "This two-hex input (7-cell displays), hex output system takes both input numbers and adds them together, then displays the output on another set of cells (in hex)."
[9:54] <Luingar> i made a trap. it consists of a small cave, with ore in one side.
[9:54] <vurtual> So, you can make sand supports for a bridge.
[9:54] <Luingar> behind the ore is water
[9:54] <Luingar> in the entrance is an airlock
[9:54] <Christoph> Airlock you say?
[9:54] <vurtual> sand seals you in?
[9:54] <Luingar> mining the ore triggers the airlock, which drops sand and gravel, sealing you in to droung
[9:54] <vurtual> "Do dee doo mining some diaamoond"
[9:54] <Luingar> *drown
[9:55] <vurtual> *water begins pouring in* "WE'VE GOT A BREAAAAACH D:"
[9:55] <Christoph> What if you just put a block in its place?
[9:55] <vurtual> *water sets off a support system, which seals the room in by opening a sandvalve that lets magma mix at the entrance

[10:00] <LuciferZ> L4D had the best elevator
[10:00] <Speljohan_> monday and overnight i turned sick
[10:01] <LuciferZ> If you threw an oxygen tank at someone in the No Mercy elevator
[10:01] <vurtual> it takes a few irl seconds for the buttons to respond again
[10:01] <LuciferZ> They fell through the floor and died
[10:01] <vurtual> it's at 10% normal speed
[10:01] <vurtual> but the elevator takes only moments irl to reach the bottom
[10:02] <vurtual> it won't move up with you standing on it, but if you jump, it quickly bats you up into the air repeatedly, launching you up
[10:02] <Christoph> I once was slow getting on the elevator.
[10:02] <Christoph> And then I somehow fell out as the doors were closing.
[10:02] <Christoph> I was stranded downstairs.
[10:02] <Christoph> The horde left me alone, so I wandered around the map.
[10:03] <Christoph> Eventually, I had to light myself on fire in order to let everyone advance.
[10:03] <vurtual> and if it hits you when you're going even mildly fast down, you get injured

[10:07] <Christoph> They have millions, but they still want more.
[10:08] <vurtual> The amount of time for the elevator to physically traverse the longest distance I have it use, is roughly the same time(or slightly shorter?), than the tiny delay I have in for the different floor holobuttons.

[10:09] <Speljohan_> biggest one in sweden
[10:09] <Christoph> Though I suspect their ceo's may be a bit misguided.
[10:09] <Speljohan_> he and his boss tend to go fishing on weekends
[10:09] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:09] <Christoph> That sounds cool.

[10:11] <Christoph> If you open the inventory, it can go out.
[10:11] <vurtual> Should I try to make this hovertank drivable?
[10:11] <Christoph> In real time.
[10:11] <Christoph> So you can leave in a safe spot while waiting for the sunrise.
[10:11] <Bodie> oh nice chritoph
[10:11] <Christoph> No problem.
[10:11] <vurtual> I could totally make an sp level out of this.
[10:12] <Christoph> So there's... Human resources... The team leads... the senior team leads... the...

[10:59] <SubBoy> Woot.
[11:00] <Luingar> i lost 'cause i got a circle drag puzzle, fucked up a memorisation puzzles, htne got another memorisation puzzle
[11:00] <Malikat> Luingar you were totally horrible at the one that was click when the text names the colour of the circle
[11:00] <Luingar> no i wasn't
[11:00] <Luingar> i always got the first one of those.
[11:00] <mnjiman> I want to play now..
[11:00] <mnjiman> lol
[11:00] <Luingar> i never missed those
[11:00] <Malikat> also the circle drag is super easy
[11:00] <mnjiman> sounds interesting
[11:00] <Malikat> because you can hold it against the wall
[11:01] <Malikat> and drag super fast
[11:01] <Luingar> i still failed at it
[11:01] <Luingar> i'm not so good at it
[11:01] <Malikat> we still kicked serious ass
[11:01] <Malikat> i think the game was like "fuck you guys need to stop now it's almost five minute"
[11:01] <Malikat> because we just started losing time like mad
[11:02] <Luingar> yeah
[11:02] <Luingar> that was annoying
[11:02] <Malikat> nah it was cool
[11:02] <Luingar> almost as bad as how i took every free moment to make my cursor rape one of yours
[11:02] <SubBoy> Still got a really high score the second time though. Also, I'm up for another round or two, there are two slots open for those that missed it before
[11:02] <Malikat> it made it more about skill and less about sitting around for four hours to get a good score

[11:13] <vurtual> Then a bunch of soldiers can come in and fight directly, so the player runs to a hover tank, then uses a holographic panel to zoom away.

[12:55] <outsomnia> Find more stone cliffs.
[12:56] <Ash_kin> Just make a pit mine.
[12:56] <outsomnia> Or just hek it.

[13:06] <outsomnia> Sort of like magnets?
[13:06] <AndrewPH> yeah how does that shit work
[13:06] <vurtual> Then you see him stumble out of a corner, and he's zombified, staring at you with some kind of spidery eyes that ripped out of his flesh, blankly.
[13:06] <vurtual> Then he moans "Eenengagggiinng", and charges at you.
[13:06] <Mithril> Lol 430 chunk updates

[13:07] <Mithril> Im playing on peaceful
[13:07] <Mithril> I always seem to die on normal
[13:08] <vurtual> You either end up killing his mutating body, leaving him stumbling to his knees and still staring at you, before collapsing, or he jumps ontop of you and rips you to shreds while staring with the gigantic spider eyes
[13:08] <yoshibot> protip: find wood and coal at the very start, build very well-lit fortress out on the sea

[13:23] <Malikat> second iteration, 9*9*9
[13:23] <Darkfire002> what....

[13:25] <vurtual> I wonder if there's a game that combines the metroid prime 2 mutilated soldiers, left 4 dead's cooperative-ness, a few cans of horror, squad-based action, a few extra cans of creepy, and zombie survival action.
[13:25] <vurtual> It could even have a proper plot and get away with it probably.
[13:27] <vurtual> You could be like, splitting up, and you find some recording made not long before some guy died in a room, then you hear it and it sorta reveals how creeped out everyone is about what's happening

[13:49] <vurtual> Until they run out of ammo, and the 4th guy has to come in railgunning everything. But, now there's only 3 left. The railgunning guy will probably end up wandering off, killing a mutated alien thing, going up to the body to look, and getting a razor-sharp tongue shot through their throat.
[13:49] <Sparky20> is this a game or a movie.

[13:53] <vurtual> He's out of ammo, the other guy traumatized(also out of ammo), and the zombied dude smacks him in the face with his gun, smashing the clear front of his helmet in, cutting his face.

[13:57] <vurtual> Even though soldiers seem a bit undying at first, even they fall.
[13:58] <vurtual> Then you find your hardcore survivalist buddy pulling off stuff like the above, maybe the game records how he acts under stress, and turns that into some screwed up killer version.
[13:58] <Sparky20> lol
[13:58] <Sparky20> U MAD
[13:59] <vurtual> That'd actually be extra scary, the fallen soldiers acting as mentally unstable/more mentally hardened/otherwise more cold blooded versions of the player.

[14:00] <vurtual> A resourceful player, who knew how to use the environment to his advantage, setting traps, and making effective use of controls panels? Backs you into a vertical garbage compressor, calmly types onto a control panel to seal the room
[14:00] <vurtual> Then watches you die through a window, not moving a muscle.
[14:01] <vurtual> If he knows you can't reliably kill him, even blasting the window to shreds and tearing up his helmet won't make him move.
[14:01] <Sparky20> Half life refrence here^
[14:02] <vurtual> Say there's only 3 who survived so far, and 2 of them have just been turned, and the game notices you were using teamwork. So then they, themselves, work togethrer to actively bring the last guy down.

He's out of ammo, the other guy traumatized(also out ofammo), and the zombied dude smacks him in the face with his gun, smashing the clear front of his helmet in, cutting his face. Then zombie dude casually walks away, the traumatized guy crying, until said guy hears an engine start up, and is beamed by headlights. Zombie dude has, audiably, gotte

[14:10] <vurtual> The only way to stop him from taking that extra last gore blow, or razortongue-through-throat, is to kill him while he's still useful.

[14:20] <Subhazard> Light bulbs are not actually "light bulbs" but dark absorbers. When you turn them on, they suck the dark out of the room. You can prove this by holding your hand under a "light bulb". The dark will stack up under your hand where its path to the absorber is blocked by your hand. When they quit working and turn a dark color, it's not because they burnt out, it's because they're full.

[17:36] <Marach-06> sppt_: i'm getting a wii to play monster hunter tri
[17:36] <vurtual> he might do music

[17:38] <vurtual> What macs can do: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7xJXoGIe04
[17:38] <vurtual> so macs are like that one class in an mmo which has lots of use but nobody really wants to use it because of the limitations.

[17:39] <sppt_> vurtual, as if you can't do that with windows or linux...
[17:40] <Marach-06> he can't. people actually use them
[17:40] <vurtual> Yeah but then you have to get lots of crazy extra effort, then it's not quiiiiite exactly what you'd get for the mac class.
[17:41] <vurtual> so if you have it, there's probably gonna be a low chance of you rerolling if you're using that specialization
[17:41] <Marach-06> wow, i filled up 128^3 worth of minecraft space
[17:41] <vurtual> with?
[17:41] <Marach-06> insane superprojects ftw
[17:41] <vurtual> buttslappingly good humor in block-text?
[17:41] <Marach-06> thanks somebody for the term
[17:42] <vurtual> I can just spit out euphamisms and strange phrases out of nowhere can't I
[17:43] <vurtual> anwyays macs have inherent support to function as an amp
[17:43] <sppt_> ...
[17:43] <vurtual> not sure if windows does that for you, or linux.
[17:43] <vurtual> might need a program first
[17:43] <Marach-06> amp?
[17:43] <sppt_> i plug my guitar into my line 6 pod xt, connect it thru USB and bam, done
[17:44] <sppt_> and besides that there's programs like guitar rig
[17:44] <Marach-06> actually might puke? :/
[17:44] <vurtual> guitar amp
[17:44] <sppt_> which actually acts as a VST plugin as well so it works on pretty much every VST-capable program
[17:44] <vurtual> What if someone like, really needed to directly plug in a guitar though? That's an almost semi-potentially-possible situation, if they somehow had no internet!

[17:45] <Marach-06> because i'm not even in half

[18:51] <Superwafflez> It's an e-book reader, it either works or it doesnt.
[18:53] <Marach-07> you'd be surprised
[18:53] <Marach-07> anyway, ds is a bad choice for ebooks...

[19:00] <Superwafflez> D=
[19:00] <vurtual> Two normal nipples, then an extra nipple down from my right nipple
[19:01] <vurtual> When people ask questions about me, I can talk about myself for about ten seconds and then go "Oh by the way, I have three nipples."
[19:01] <vurtual> It's cool.
[19:01] <Superwafflez> oh wow
[19:02] <Marach-07> Monster Hunter Tri, i'm coooooooooooming!!
[19:02] <PuyoDead> I only just started it, but it seemed pretty cool so far.
[19:02] <Marach-07> now i just need a wii
[19:03] <PuyoDead> Yea, that's kind of important.
[19:03] <Marach-07> and a usb keyboard

[19:03] <vurtual> Kids and not-quite-kids alike.
[19:03] <vurtual> I think I should get some sleep-it's 10am, woah!
[19:03] <Marach-07> vurtual: because it's awesome?
[19:04] <Othilious1> Man, I played it before it became cool! All old-skool playstation like!

[19:04] <Bodie> :(
[19:04] <Bodie> this comic has got me all teary
[19:04] <PuyoDead> People have been moist over that series since it came out.
[19:04] <Marach-07> this game can be either loved or hated.
[19:05] <Marach-07> it simple takes a genre, then flips all the cliches and game mechanics inside-out
[19:05] <Superwafflez> anyway im goinggggg
[19:05] <Marach-07> simply*
[19:05] <PuyoDead> I played the PSP ones, and generally never got very far.
[19:05] <Othilious1> It can be HARD.
[19:05] <Marach-07> PuyoDead: HR?
[19:05] <Superwafflez> australia says i have to get up in five hours
[19:05] <Superwafflez> yey
[19:05] <PuyoDead> Probably because the PSP controlls are poop.

[19:16] <Codlike> PDF files are documents though Quatroo
[19:16] <Quatroking> marach how about quit whining
[19:16] <KodaichiZero> you can dissect the format and just read the plain text
[19:16] <Marach-07> you're the one whining. you didn't even say what do you have
[19:16] <KodaichiZero> .doc files are somewhat readable in notepad.
[19:17] <Quatroking> what I have?
[19:17] <KodaichiZero> i imagine the same is true for pdf's
[19:17] <Marach-07> KodaichiZero: it's not that simple
[19:17] <KodaichiZero> I stand corrected
[19:17] <Marach-07> i wish it was

[19:19] <Quatroking> I gave up after the fifth time that my provider shut my account because I didn't use it
[19:19] <KodaichiZero> had to remove the channel
[19:19] <KodaichiZero> there was no evidence, so I was fine
[19:19] <Marach-07> yeah
[19:19] <Marach-07> you obviously made a backup of everything

[19:48] <bildramer> sticks?
[19:48] <Konogan> *wood
[19:48] <chromium24> I guess it made a little more sense than framing a picture with solid wood blocks
[19:48] <bildramer> ohai
[19:48] <chromium24> No, no, in infdev, it's sticks
[19:48] <Konogan> Oh, lol.
[19:48] <chromium24> This means that it no longer takes more wood to frame a picture than build a wall
[19:48] <bildramer> :l
[19:49] <bildramer> yeah
[19:49] <bildramer> we need fireplaces

[19:49] <chromium24> I was thinking about that, and what if there was a tool you could use and select a 3d-space
[19:49] <chromium24> and it would save the structure in the space as a block of its own, to be reproduced?
[19:50] <chromium24> chairs and fireplaces wouldn't have to be 20 feet tall
[19:50] <Jackomel> I wish there was an editor to mix and match chunks in infdev
[19:50] <Jackomel> withouth resorting to random file moving
[19:50] <bildramer> indeed
[19:50] <bildramer> me too
[19:50] <chromium24> I wish the terrain generator was more crazy, less gentle hills and small ponds

[20:51] <Scrippy> Awww yeah cacti.

[20:52] * coolpilot-afk is off to play Volcano Survival on Indev
[20:52] <Scrippy> What kind of custom server fleur?
[20:52] <Quatroking> Theoratically, Windows 64bit should be able to use 192GB of ram
[20:52] <Fleur> Scrippy: c# or something i have a friend who can code in it
[20:53] <Mithril> Has notch been on today?
[20:53] <Fleur> Quatroking: but can a motherboard handle that? lol
[20:53] <Scrippy> Ermm, I mean what custom features?
[20:53] <TerraSleet> if you have 4GB of RAM on a 32 bit OS i think your processor can only use like 3GB of it
[20:53] <Quatroking> Fleur: I've seen motherboards supporting 32GB
[20:53] <Mithril> Yup 3,25 GB
[20:53] <LG_Legacy> Notch has not been on at all lately
[20:53] <LG_Legacy> No wait
[20:53] <Fleur> Quatroking: have you seen them supporting 192 gigs? lol
[20:53] <Mithril> ok ty LG
[20:53] <chromium24> 64 bit can handle, theoretically, 16.3 billion gigabytes of ram. I don't think anything supports that much, though
[20:53] <LG_Legacy> Notch was on yesterday
[20:53] <Chris220> My creative server's up if anyone feels like playing on a server with no griefers

[20:56] <chromium24> The second one is actually adding more heat to your computer than it's taking away from your processor, thanks to the laws of thermodynamics
[20:56] <Fleur> Im getting a full tower case o.O
[20:57] <Fleur> chromium24: would you bother reading teh stuff on it
[20:57] <chromium24> Yes. Peltier coolers are not 100% efficient. They take power to transfer heat. It will cool your processor but for every watt of heat energy it takes away, slightly more than a watt will come out
[20:57] <TerraSleet> he said the word thermodynamics, listen to him
[20:58] <Fleur> "Peltier Cooler," is a solid-state active heat pump capable of transferring heat from one side of the device to the other. Ultra uses a TEC sandwiched between two aluminum plates, each plate with four heat-pipes leading to a large, fan cooled radiator.
[20:58] <Fleur> they lied then?
[20:58] <Fleur> O.o
[20:58] <TerraSleet> i don't see the point in getting a beefed up computer
[20:58] <chromium24> Oh, no. It'll keep your processor cool

[20:58] <Fleur> TerraSleet: o.o cooling is important in any computer
[20:58] <chromium24> It just is kind of durr hurr
[20:58] <TerraSleet> i was generalising
[20:58] <Fleur> i don't trust liquid cooling though

[20:58] <chromium24> If you want cooling, not much gets better than just liqu--
[20:58] <chromium24> Oh.
[20:58] <Chris220> TerraSleet, I agree :)
[20:58] <Fleur> unless im buying nonconductive water
[20:59] <Fleur> cooland
[20:59] <Fleur> stuff
[20:59] <Fleur> w/e
[20:59] <Quatroking> I don't see how liquid cooling is supposed to be all silent
[20:59] <Fleur> it's not..
[20:59] <Quatroking> People seem to forget the radiator
[20:59] <TerraSleet> you need a pump to get the liquid moving
[20:59] <chromium24> Water isn't actually very conductive! Water with stuff in it is, though. Like salt, or dust, or... actually, anythin
[20:59] <Fleur> the pump makes noise
[20:59] <Fleur> lol
[20:59] <TerraSleet> so, no

[20:59] * Snowman (Snowman@sd51100a0.adsl.wanadoo.nl) has joined #minecraft
[20:59] <TerraSleet> i'm pretty sure liquid cooling uses other chemicals than just water..
[20:59] <bildramer> solution: cool the pump with liquid nitrogen
[20:59] <Snowman> Hey
[20:59] <bildramer> durr
[20:59] <Mithril> <chromium24> The second one is actually adding more heat to your computer than it's taking away from your processor, thanks to the laws of thermodynamics - Heat and computer? My PC is actually cooling my room temp
[20:59] <Quatroking> snowman you _just_ missed the multiplayer link.
[20:59] <Chris220> Still, don't go testing it by pouring water all over your PC
[20:59] <TerraSleet> lol liquid nitrogen
[20:59] <Chris220> it won't do it any good :P
[20:59] <TerraSleet> good luck keeping it liquid

[21:01] <Quatroking> too lazy anyways
[21:01] <Snowman> :3
[21:01] <chromium24> Either water or nice simple aluminum radiators, Fleur, that's the way to go. A simple air radiator can get an i7-920 to almost 4 ghz

[21:02] <Fleur> Mithril: I have a giant block of aluminum cooling my cpu with a stock fan with a heat shield thing sucking the hot air from between the heatsinks vents...is hard to explain lol
[21:02] <TerraSleet> i have a better idea
[21:02] <TerraSleet> put a jet engine in your computer
[21:02] <Quatroking> http://www.coolermaster.com/product.php?category_id=7&product_id=6074
[21:02] <Speljohan_> pfft
[21:02] <Speljohan_> my project is awesomest
[21:03] <Fleur> chromium24: copper is better at heat transfer
[21:03] <Speljohan_> a steam-driven computer
[21:03] <TerraSleet> just don't forget to support it with steel beams to the ground
[21:03] <Quatroking> that thing requires a fucking 200 watts
[21:03] <Speljohan_> complete with a psu that has a coal oven
[21:03] <TerraSleet> unless you want your computer to fly
[21:03] <Mithril> My CPU is currently at 32 C, but Ive seen it at 27 C
[21:03] <TerraSleet> i don't really care what temperature my CPU is :V
[21:03] <Quatroking> hmm
[21:03] <Fleur> that thing
[21:03] <chromium24> copper is best used as pipes. Shit's expensive, yo
[21:03] <Fleur> is huge
[21:03] <Quatroking> My cpu seems to be running above 50 lately
[21:03] <TerraSleet> as long as it's not crashing and whirring i'm fine
[21:04] <Quatroking> fleur: it probably uses more power than your GPU
[21:04] <Fleur> chromium24: not when your friends with a heating/cooling company
[21:04] <Snowman> Quatroking, stop using FF :p
[21:04] <chromium24> Also, lest we forget, it's also conductive
[21:04] <Quatroking> isn't that awesome

[21:04] <Quatroking> Snowman, no
[21:04] <bildramer> didn't Notch enter LD?
[21:04] <Fleur> Quatroking: i have a 400 watt gpu..lol
[21:04] <Quatroking> meh
[21:04] <Snowman> bildramer, nope, he was too busy
[21:04] <Speljohan_> i used to have a 400 watt gpu

[21:05] <Quatroking> I wonder how people attach that Coolermaster V10
[21:05] <Fleur> geforce galaxy 240
[21:05] <Quatroking> I mean, fuck, its huge
[21:05] <bildramer> hah
[21:05] <chromium24> because as it turns out, 2x4850 beats almost any graphics card on the market right now under $600
[21:05] <Speljohan_> V12 is bigger Quatroking
[21:05] <Speljohan_> :>
[21:05] <Snowman> 1x GeForce 8600M GT
[21:05] <Mithril> <Fleur> Quatroking: i have a 400 watt gpu..lol - Lol thats like more power then my whole PC uses
[21:05] <Quatroking> They have a V12 already?
[21:05] <Speljohan_> really chromium24
[21:05] <Fleur> that i paid 120$ for ...at bestbuy...which i'd return if the 30 day return wasnt up
[21:05] <Speljohan_> i sold my cards
[21:05] <Mithril> I have a Geforce 210
[21:05] <Speljohan_> and bought a gtx 275 OC instead
[21:05] <Quatroking> Mithril I have a 850W PSU in my rig
[21:05] <Mithril> cheap videocard
[21:05] <Speljohan_> lol
[21:05] <Quatroking> :#
[21:05] <Speljohan_> i didn't like the sound level of dual cards
[21:05] <Scrippy> Hooray stock laptops!
[21:05] <Fleur> Mithril: my psu is only 350 watts
[21:05] <Mithril> Lol giant overheat
[21:05] <Speljohan_> in fact, all new gfx cards suck ass
[21:05] <chromium24> Almost, but yes, Tomshardware says they're actually damn good, and from what I can tell mine manage to do excellently in anything
[21:05] <Speljohan_> for volume
[21:06] <Fleur> Speljohan_: yeah
[21:06] <Scrippy> Also my cooling fan is broken.
[21:06] <Fleur> almost all new graphics cards use dx11
[21:06] <Speljohan_> seriously, any gtx card sounds like a fucking vacuum when you max a game like, say crysis out
[21:06] <Fleur> no games are using direct x 11
[21:06] <Mithril> I just buy a cheap 40 euro graphicscard, so it can handle full HD youtube without problems
[21:06] <chromium24> STALKER: CoP
[21:06] <Speljohan_> loll cus flash sux anus Mithril
[21:06] <Quatroking> jesus fuck that V12 is a giant
[21:06] <Scrippy> My laptop is cooled solely via external USB cooling fan pushing air directly into the intake vent.
[21:06] <Speljohan_> such a cpu whore
[21:06] <Speljohan_> yeah Quatroking
[21:06] <Fleur> like vista..
[21:06] <chromium24> SCOP looks like buttered sex with Dx11
[21:06] <Speljohan_> it's for the memories too Quatroking
[21:06] <Mithril> yeah I know but I want Full HD youtube
[21:06] <Mithril> Else I have my Fiber for nothing
[21:06] <Fleur> I had the new ati card
[21:07] <Quatroking> The V10 looks nicer tho

[21:07] <Speljohan_> i'll be buying a new card
[21:07] <Quatroking> My new HD5770 is being delivered tomorrow
[21:07] <Fleur> chromium24: yes
[21:07] <Mithril> And I kinda like the fact that minecraft still runs at 100 FPS at 500 chunk updates
[21:07] <Quatroking> I'm probably buying an extra one, and then going crossfire, later this year
[21:07] <Speljohan_> do note: i'm probably not buying an nvidia card
[21:07] <bildramer> http://i.imgur.com/8QXKH.jpg
[21:07] <Speljohan_> i just want them to release
[21:07] <Speljohan_> to see what happens to market
[21:07] <bildramer> precisely describes my keyboard experience
[21:07] <Fleur> chromium24: but because it takes up two slots it wouldnt fit and i took it back and got an nvidia card..
[21:07] <chromium24> Why is it that AMD makes awful processors, but ATI makes such amazing graphics cards
[21:07] <Speljohan_> buying in established market > buying bleeding edge
[21:07] <Fleur> i hear nvidia is better then ati anyways
[21:08] <Speljohan_> it's mostly fanboyism Fleur
[21:08] <Speljohan_> like always
[21:08] <Quantum_Potato> nvidia's pretty good
[21:08] <Speljohan_> they keep beating eachother time over time
[21:08] <Quantum_Potato> they deserve their market share
[21:08] <Speljohan_> it's always gonna be like that

[21:08] <Quantum_Potato> DIRTY TACTICS!?!?
[21:08] <Fleur> well the only video card makers i've heard of is nvidia and ati and they both market there crap under so many names
[21:08] <Quatroking> He just painted the thing.
[21:08] <Scrippy> Because I cannot wait for augmented reality.
[21:09] <Speljohan_> they refused to give card up to some reviewer because they claimed all games must run CUDA
[21:09] <Speljohan_> something which obviously ati would fail in
[21:09] <Fleur> just watched donald bitch slap the cat..
[21:09] <bildramer> http://qntm.org/suicide
[21:09] <Quantum_Potato> actually, nvidia and ati just create the chipset, which other manufactureres put on their videocards
[21:09] <bildramer> we need that
[21:09] <chromium24> One spilled soda, Quatroking
[21:09] <Fleur> whats cuda?
[21:09] <Quatroking> chromium24, wat
[21:09] <Speljohan_> they usually create the whole thing Quantum_Potato
[21:09] <Quatroking> fleur: gpu-powered coding or something
[21:09] <Speljohan_> give company pecs
[21:09] <chromium24> One spilled soda to tell you why computers have sides on their cases for a reason
[21:09] <Speljohan_> allow them to alter to an extent
[21:09] <Speljohan_> and then release
[21:10] <Fleur> oh
[21:10] <Quatroking> chromium what
[21:10] <Quantum_Potato> isn't that what i said?
[21:10] <Quatroking> how are you supposed to take pictures if you don't take off the sidepanel
[21:10] <Speljohan_> they create drivers as well Quantum_Potato
[21:10] <Speljohan_> loll
[21:10] <Fleur> i get like...240 fps on minecraft if it's a good day, i don't have good enough psu to push the card
[21:10] <chromium24> I thought his 'mod' was he took off the side panel and painted some bits
[21:11] <Quatroking> his 'mod' is painting over some components
[21:11] <Quatroking> nothing more
[21:11] <Speljohan_> i probably get moar fps in minecraft
[21:11] <Speljohan_> lol
[21:11] <chromium24> If it was just painting some bits you couldn't see without taking off the panel then it's double-stupid

[21:15] <chromium24> One that works when I'm 80 blocks below ground and lost in my unlabeled rat warren of tunnels
[21:15] <Scrippy> Right.
[21:16] <Scrippy> I think that should be a makeable item.
[21:16] <Fleur> we need units of measurement in minecraft...I declare 10 minecraft blocks a chunk xD and 20 doublechunk xD xD
[21:16] <chromium24> Four iron in a diamond shape
[21:16] <Quantum_Potato> i think night should be slightly lighter
[21:16] <Scrippy> I will use that from now on fleur.
[21:16] <chromium24> One block in minecraft is a meter
[21:16] <Scrippy> 100 shall be a decachunk

[21:16] <MPeti> hi all
[21:17] <chromium24> The player is 1.7 meters tall
[21:17] <Quantum_Potato> so it would be ten square metres
[21:17] <Fleur> epic
[21:17] <Fleur> lol
[21:17] <Scrippy> And 10,000 shall be a kilochunk.
[21:17] <Quantum_Potato> then twenty square metres
[21:17] <Fleur> go four doublechunks west xD
[21:17] <Quantum_Potato> then a hundred square metres
[21:17] <MPeti> chromium24, he changed it to 2 metres actually.
[21:17] * Icereed (icereed@mnch-5d855859.pool.mediaWays.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[21:17] <Scrippy> I like chunks.
[21:17] <MPeti> Because it looks that way.
[21:17] <Quantum_Potato> metres
[21:17] <Scrippy> Minecraft should have it's own units of measurement.
[21:17] <Fleur> i just thought about using chunks cause its a chunk based map or w/e
[21:17] <Quantum_Potato> no, metres
[21:18] <MPeti> lol, atually yeah, scrippy
[21:18] <Fleur> Quantum_Potato: im in the US we don't use meters..
[21:18] <Scrippy> I am 1.7 decichunks tall.
[21:18] <MPeti> actually *
[21:18] <chromium24> I'm in the US, I use meters when it comes to things that are measured in meters
[21:18] <Fleur> so we need a universal minecraft standard...UMCS
[21:18] <Jackomel> you should legally use meters
[21:18] <MPeti> scrippy, a chunk is 16^3
[21:18] <Fleur> yards
[21:18] <Vicrry> Minecraft has it's own measurement: block :P
[21:18] <Scrippy> Arg.
[21:18] <Scrippy> That is too complicated.
[21:18] * FalleM (IceChat7@ti0111a380-2242.bb.online.no) has left #minecraft
[21:18] <Quantum_Potato> yeah, but minecraft isn't american
[21:18] <Quantum_Potato> so it uses the metric system
[21:18] <Fleur> the UMCS declares a chunk ten blocks..lol
[21:19] <Ekko> Like everyone should
[21:19] <Quantum_Potato> like everyone else in the world
[21:19] <Scrippy> It SHOULD use the chunk system.
[21:19] <Fleur> Quantum_Potato: >:/
[21:19] <MPeti> well, that means you are 1 and 1/16 decichunks then :P
[21:19] <Ekko> Metric > *
[21:19] <chromium24> So you're looking for .625 chunk^1/3
[21:19] <chromium24> that would be ten blocks in one direction
[21:19] <MPeti> whaat
[21:19] <Scrippy> Well we could have a unit type for linear units
[21:19] <MPeti> bah
[21:19] <bildramer> ...
[21:19] <bildramer> wtf dudes
[21:19] <MPeti> I hate things that I don't understand >.<
[21:19] <Snowman> Ok, this wek's Loading Ready RUn was just wat
[21:19] <Scrippy> And then a different name for units^3
[21:19] <bildramer> 1 block = 1 meter^3
[21:20] <bildramer> = 1000 liters
[21:20] <MPeti> By the way, have you seen the "dynamic structures" thread in the indev forum
[21:20] <bildramer> 1 chunk = 4096 blocks
[21:20] <bildramer> = 4096000 liters
[21:20] <bildramer> etc.
[21:20] <MPeti> which turned into a binary adders/half-adders/multiplers/gates/stuff thread
[21:20] <LG_Legacy> I should be banned from TinyPic
[21:20] <bildramer> don't see a problem
[21:20] <bildramer> lol
[21:20] <Scrippy> I vote that the official UMCS standard of 1 chunk should be 10 blocks ^ 3
[21:20] <bildramer> why?
[21:20] <Scrippy> Mpeti: Link me?
[21:21] <MPeti> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=11523
[21:21] <bildramer> <Scrippy> I vote that the official Universal MineCraft Standard standard of 1 chunk should be 10 blocks ^ 3

[21:21] <Scrippy> Derp
[21:21] <MPeti> that's where someone posted a 6-bit binary adder

[21:21] <MPeti> the same guy is working on a 4-bit multipler atm

[21:22] * Fleur sneezes
[21:22] <MPeti> right now, it'd take loads of space if I made it
[21:22] <MPeti> it does anyway, but it'd take even more xD
[21:22] <Fleur> universal minecraft measurement standards...or UMMS
[21:22] <Fleur> lolol
[21:22] <MPeti> yeah :D
[21:22] <Snowman> 1 block is 1 cubic meter
[21:23] <MPeti> yep

[21:23] <Snowman> All you need
[21:23] <Fleur> how longs a meter

[21:23] <Snowman> Exactly one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth's equator to the North Pole
[21:23] <MPeti> chromium24, are you sure it's the old?
[21:23] <chromium24> Yes, that's the old one
[21:23] <MPeti> there are some strange formations in it still
[21:23] <chromium24> Big swooping overhangs, tons of water
[21:24] <MPeti> yeah
[21:24] * Fleur is already confused
[21:24] * Fleur mass email
[21:24] <chromium24> Oh, certainly, but I once spawned, looked up, and there was an island about 120 meters above the ground. Nothing even CLOSE to it. No way to reach it.
[21:24] <chromium24> That was the old level generator
[21:24] <MPeti> Fleur, well I am European, so I ALWAYS use metric stuff
[21:24] <Fleur> my friends boyfriend flashed me earlier
[21:24] <Scrippy> What should be the standard of linear measurement for UMMS?
[21:24] <MPeti> so I have no idea how to explain it to you
[21:24] <Scrippy> I vote not Meters.
[21:25] <Snowman> A meter is also the length light travels in a vacuum in a time of 1/299792458 seconds
[21:25] <Fleur> MPeti: well im american so i will always come up with retarded lazy shortcuts around it
[21:25] <MPeti> scrippy, decablock?
[21:25] <chromium24> I vote meters because it's unnecessary to add more units

[21:25] <MPeti> kiloblock
[21:25] <chromium24> 1 block-length = 1 meter exactly
[21:25] <bildramer> 1 block

[21:25] <MPeti> fleur, that doesn't exist xD

[21:25] <Fleur> so we walk at like 3 meters/s
[21:25] <MPeti> Megablock, gigablock rather
[21:25] <bildramer> 8th of a block
[21:25] <Scrippy> Because we are dumb and we like minecraft-spesific units.
[21:25] <bildramer> no
[21:25] <bildramer> 16th
[21:26] <MPeti> we need milliblocks xD 1/1000 of a block
[21:26] <MPeti> and microblock
[21:26] <Snowman> Why use a measurement system that makes no sense?
[21:26] * Fleur facepalms
[21:26] <bildramer> 0.0625 blocks is the standard pixel graphics thingy constant
[21:26] <chromium24> But it also means that we can derive things like the exact constant of gravitation in minecraft
[21:26] <MPeti> 1/1000 of milliblock
[21:26] <Fleur> what have i started lol
[21:26] <Scrippy> A chunk is 10^3
[21:26] <Fleur> there are 4 pixles in a block
[21:26] <MPeti> nope
[21:26] <MPeti> 16^3
[21:26] <Fleur> i think
[21:26] <bildramer> nanoblock, picoblobk, attoblock, femtoblock
[21:26] <chromium24> yes, 16^3
[21:26] <MPeti> fleur, WHAAT?
[21:26] <bildramer> ^
[21:26] <Scrippy> Well as per programming standards
[21:26] <MPeti> there are 15 x 15 x 6
[21:26] <bildramer> wat
[21:26] <chromium24> anyone who thinks a block is based on a power of ten needs to take up programming
[21:26] <MPeti> for the whole block
[21:26] <Fleur> MPeti: lol 6 pixels?
[21:26] <chromium24> *chunk
[21:27] <MPeti> 6 sides
[21:27] * Quantum_Potato (cruelnoise@67-43-136-144.agas1a-dynamic.dsl.sentex.ca) has joined #minecraft
[21:27] <bildramer> ...
[21:27] <MPeti> each side has 15x15
[21:27] <bildramer> 16
[21:27] <Fleur> im counting one side
[21:27] <bildramer> not 15
[21:27] <bildramer> nub
[21:27] <Fleur> one length on one side
[21:27] <Scrippy> Yes I know it is 16^3
[21:27] <Fleur> :/
[21:27] <MPeti> dang
[21:27] <Fleur> 16^2?
[21:27] <MPeti> mwah, 16x16x6 thenb
[21:27] <chromium24> So it's either use meters -- nice, easy meters -- or chunks, which aren't actually chunks
[21:27] <MPeti> 6 is side
[21:27] <Scrippy> But I am being silly and arbitrary here and am thinking of things in a distance spesific scale.
[21:27] <MPeti> lol
[21:27] <MPeti> chromium, blocks!
[21:27] <chromium24> Blocks are meters
[21:27] <Mithril> Meh infdev is getting boring
[21:27] <Scrippy> I like chunks that aren't actually chunks.
[21:27] <chromium24> Blocks are meters with a new name
[21:27] <Mithril> Infdev is just always the same
[21:27] <MPeti> block, decablock, hectablock, kiloblock
[21:27] <Scrippy> Blocks are for linear?
[21:28] <chromium24> A block is 1m^3
[21:28] <MPeti> I like those, sound nice :D
[21:28] <bildramer> ^
[21:28] <Snowman> A sector is 16x16x16m
[21:28] <chromium24> A blockwidth is a meter
[21:28] <Fleur> o.o i hate math
[21:28] <MPeti> chromium24, I know
[21:28] <Mithril> I cant wait for multiplayer Survival
[21:28] <MPeti> I just like it
[21:28] <Scrippy> I like that
[21:28] * Fleur emailed notch
[21:28] <Snowman> Since the map is generated in sectors
[21:28] <MPeti> mithril, is there anyone who can?
[21:28] <chromium24> That'd be a good unit, actually, blength
[21:28] <Scrippy> A sector is 16^3 and a chunk is 10^3
[21:28] <chromium24> A blength is a meter
[21:28] <Mithril> dont think so
[21:28] <Fleur> why is this guy looking at me like hes hungry..
[21:28] <Fleur> im scared
[21:28] <chromium24> A block is a cubic meter
[21:28] <MPeti> scrippy, told you, NO
[21:28] <MPeti> chunk = 16^3
[21:28] <Fleur> sectors!
[21:28] <bildramer> chunk = 16^3 blocks
[21:28] <Quantum_Potato> because he wants to eat you.
[21:29] <Fleur> we can use sectors in minecraft
[21:29] <bildramer> sector = wtf meaningless
[21:29] <chromium24> A bolygon is a meter cubed
[21:29] <Fleur> 4 decablocks = a sector
[21:29] <Fleur> xD
[21:29] <Scrippy> Aww MPeti you are not fun.
[21:29] <bildramer> why decablocks?
[21:29] <chromium24> *squared
[21:29] <MPeti> lol
[21:29] <Fleur> cause i forgot what the other one was
[21:29] <MPeti> bildamer, deca = 10 of something
[21:29] <Fleur> lol
[21:29] <bildramer> yes
[21:29] <MPeti> bildramer *
[21:29] <bildramer> but why?
[21:29] <Scrippy> Is sector like a variation of Acre now?
[21:29] <MPeti> so, 10 blocks = decablock :D for fun
[21:29] <chromium24> But really I just use meters, because it makes things much more real. A lake that's twenty blocks deep is just a thing in a game. A lake that's twenty meters deep is something you can imagine
[21:29] <Fleur> i never thought of acres..
[21:29] <bildramer> We don't say m^2 = 100 * m * m either
[21:29] <Fleur> we can measure lengths in minecraft by fives..lol
[21:30] <bildramer> for example
[21:30] <MPeti> dang, what's an acre? >.<
[21:30] <Scrippy> I don't even know
[21:30] <Scrippy> Some feet ^ 2
[21:30] <Fleur> theres like over 1k feet in an acre
[21:30] <Fleur> lol
[21:30] <chromium24> If you want to derive a unit for minecraft, the best way to do it would be to use something that's easily measured and remembered. Blocks are theoretically nice for this, but it's hard to count blocks as you run
[21:30] <bildramer> hahaha
[21:30] <bildramer> non-metric fail
[21:30] <Fleur> One acre comprises 4840 square yards or 43560 square feet

[21:31] <bildramer> and now let's see
[21:31] <Fleur> Scrippy: how >:/
[21:31] <bildramer> metric is powers of ten
[21:31] <Mithril> I hope notch adds some other way in the game to get coblestone, cause I get tired of mining every 10 min
[21:31] <Fleur> feet are better then weight being measured in stones
[21:31] <bildramer> easy stuff

[21:31] <Fleur> how did i get weight from measurement
[21:31] <Scrippy> Because it is a system with lots of different conversion rates for different scales.

[21:31] <Quantum_Potato> what he said
[21:31] <chromium24> Mithril, I hate you. I have six -- SIX -- huge chests full of cobblestone
[21:31] <bildramer> 1 blocklength = 1 meter
[21:31] <MPeti> minecraft should use a pentacimal or pentamal or however it's said system for fun and for confusing people :D
[21:31] <bildramer> 1 blockface = 1 meter^2
[21:31] <Mithril> Give it to me
[21:31] <chromium24> You want some, GOD DAMN, TAKE SOME
[21:31] <Fleur> chromium24: share
[21:32] <bildramer> 1 block = 1 meter^3
[21:32] <Fleur> i have three chests full of black cloth
[21:32] <Fleur> lol
[21:32] <bildramer> 1 block^(4/3) = 1 meter^4
[21:32] <bildramer> if we ever get 4D
[21:32] <chromium24> I actually had eight but I broke the chests and let the stone disappear itself away
[21:32] <Scrippy> I like MPeti's idea
[21:32] <Fleur> what would 4d look like
[21:32] <Azathoth> chests full of materials are now the new standard for e-peen length
[21:32] <MPeti> scrippy, lol

[21:33] <MPeti> bildramer, yeah :D
[21:33] <Fleur> i'd rather stick to dimensions below 4d
[21:33] <Scrippy> I just like the idea of a chunk being 10x10x10

[21:33] <Azathoth> this reminds me of planiverse again

[21:33] <Fleur> Scrippy: so 500 blocks = a chunk? lol
[21:33] <Marach-07> Scrippy: impossible
[21:34] <Marach-07> chunks are 16^3.

[21:35] <bildramer> Scrippy: IT IS A CHUNK
[21:35] <MPeti> heard *
[21:35] <bildramer> CONSTANT
[21:35] <bildramer> YOU CANNOT EVEN CHANG EIT
[21:36] <chromium24> Infdev uses a fragmented storage system with hundreds of files. There's probably a way but good luck figuring it out
[21:36] <bildramer> now shuddup and accept that a chunk equals 4096 blocks
[21:36] <MPeti> scrippy, chunks are what Notch uses for generating a map!
[21:36] <Scrippy> Bildramer I am not saying we should change it
[21:36] <Snowman> We just won't measure things. /discussion
[21:36] <bildramer> and not in any shape either
[21:36] <Marach-07> infdev current file format is a placeholder
[21:36] <MPeti> you can't decide that
[21:36] <Scrippy> I know this!
[21:36] <bildramer> well
[21:36] <Fleur> I want something someoen who hates math can compregend
[21:36] <Fleur> comprehend
[21:36] <Snowman> LET'S NOT MEASURE STUFF! /discussion
[21:36] <bildramer> 10 * 10 * 10 blocks is just a kiloblock
[21:36] <Fleur> think ya can manage that?
[21:36] <chromium24> Yes, Snowman
[21:36] <Fleur> lol
[21:36] <MPeti> snowman, actually right :D
[21:36] <chromium24> I think that's the best idea
[21:36] <Azathoth> let's measure Snowman
[21:36] <bildramer> so use "kiloblock
[21:36] <Scrippy> I just think it's silly to try to use a 16x16x16 block as a standard measurement for volume.
[21:36] <bildramer> "
[21:36] <chromium24> He's a snowman high
[21:36] <Snowman> I'm 25 Awesome
[21:36] <chromium24> and about a snowman wide
[21:36] <Scrippy> It's like using feet for chrissake
[21:36] <bildramer> we never said that we should use it as standard
[21:37] <bildramer> Notch will probably do that
[21:37] <bildramer> and most people trying to mod/program stuff
[21:37] <MPeti> actually, for built stuff, people won't really measure, other than when planning
[21:37] <MPeti> for inventory stuff
[21:37] <Snowman> Let's measure everything in mycock, 1024 blocks is 1 mycock
[21:37] <MPeti> people will always use stacks
[21:37] <Fleur> i'd prefer no one mod the core game
[21:37] <Azathoth> :D
[21:37] <Demki> Scrippy, it isn't a standard measurement of volume, it is a CHUNK, the map is generated 1 chunk at a time
[21:37] <Fleur> i hate when there are multiple versions of one game
[21:37] <Demki> and is calculated in chunks
[21:37] <chromium24> All I want is a compass and a simple "tape measure" that tells me the distance between the center of any two blocks I click on

[21:39] <Demki> 5 is a fun number

[21:39] <Azathoth> holy shit. 5 IS fun
[21:39] <chromium24> Yes
[21:39] <chromium24> Exactly
[21:39] <Snowman> Let's measure everything in wavelengths of krypton radiation
[21:39] <MPeti> yeah, let's use a pentamal system

[21:39] <MPeti> but it's pentamal I think
[21:39] <Demki> O.O
[21:39] <bildramer> or triangulation if you can view 1. the second block from the first block and/or 2. both blocks from a fixed position
[21:39] <MPeti> lol :D

[21:40] <Demki> let's just use metres
[21:40] <chromium24> Wait
[21:40] <chromium24> ... we do that
[21:40] <Snowman> One block is 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of Krypton-86 radiation in a vaccum
[21:40] <Demki> lol
[21:40] <chromium24> BETTER YET, let's throw the cesium into a puddle and watch it explode!
[21:40] <Snowman> It is true.
[21:40] <Fleur> o.o
[21:40] <MPeti> let's measure by the pressure of the air between the two blocks!

[22:02] <chromium24> I think (?) he was being sarcastic

[22:03] <Azathoth> no
[22:03] <Azathoth> you can't state that
[22:03] <Demki> Overlord, that is called the big bang THEOR
[22:03] <chromium24> Apparently not, plavix left right away
[22:03] <Demki> THEORY* for a reason
[22:03] <Overlord> but it is matter from nothing
[22:03] <Overlord> is my point
[22:03] <Litestrider> Demki, that's now what the word Theory means in the context of scientific theory.
[22:04] <Fleur> YOU ARE QUESTIONING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
[22:04] <Fleur> THIS IS
[22:04] <Fleur> UNHEARD OF
[22:04] <Azathoth> does the big bang theory even assert that the matter comes from nothing?
[22:04] <Overlord> Well, where did it come from?
[22:04] <Azathoth> i thought it said something about a super dense ball of mass or something
[22:04] <Fleur> urmom
[22:04] <Fleur> xD
[22:04] <Fleur> sowwe had to do it..
[22:04] <bildramer> Overlord: noone knows
[22:04] <Overlord> The only other option is to state that all the energy in the universe has always existed
[22:04] <bildramer> it existed
[22:04] <Demki> Fleur, it is okay to question the laws of physics
[22:04] <Scrippy> Big bang theory says:
[22:04] <bildramer> ninja;d
[22:05] <chromium24> Overlord, the current understanding of the laws of physics is insufficient to hypothesize on the exact nature and origin of the big bang
[22:05] <Scrippy> And then there was stuff.
[22:05] <Litestrider> Well, last I heard the popular idea was that the big bang not only created our universe, but also created TIME, so it gets a bit weird when you talk about stuff before that.
[22:05] <Scrippy> And it expanded.
[22:05] <chromium24> Litestrider, you are correct
[22:05] <Overlord> But exactly litestrider
[22:05] <Overlord> I was about to say that
[22:05] <Azathoth> maybe the big bang was a tear in some dimensional boundary!
[22:05] <MPeti> Google says, for theory: a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world; an organized system of accepted knowledge that applies in a variety of ...
[22:05] <chromium24> Azathoth, that's actually a major theory
[22:05] <Scrippy> My knowledge of creation physics is pretty much limited to a basic conceptual understanding of string theory
[22:06] <Scrippy> Brotip: it is probably wrong.
[22:06] <Overlord> So if there are infinite dimensions
[22:06] <MPeti> big bang theory:

It consists of cover versions of c
[22:06] <Scrippy> There aren't
[22:06] <Overlord> then the universe is infinite
[22:06] <Scrippy> There are something like 13 dimensions, according to String Theory.
[22:06] <Azathoth> thanks mpeti
[22:06] <Scrippy> Each sort of like a new plane.
[22:06] <chromium24> Which turned out to be bollocks
[22:06] <Azathoth> that's what i said
[22:06] <Overlord> If it exists before time, and after time, it is infinite
[22:07] <Litestrider> Only in the perspective of time.
[22:07] <chromium24> You know, as much as I like speculating about physics, I hope no one figures it all out within my lifetime
[22:07] <Scrippy> There are however multiple universises.
[22:07] <Demki> "well-substantiated" is not necessarily true, just there aren't proves that it is wrong.

[22:07] <chromium24> Scrippy, we're on pace!
[22:08] <Demki> Scrippy, not infinite
[22:08] <Scrippy> But we though we'd have flying cars by now, so I'm skeptical.
[22:08] <Fleur> The problem with America is stupidity. I'm not saying there should be a capital punishment for stupidity, but why don't we just take the safety labels off of everything and let the problem solve itself?

[22:08] <Scrippy> And I'd probably just do internet with a handheld.
[22:08] <Azathoth> well at some point, it should start to pull itself together by some unknown force
[22:08] <Scrippy> For the love of god not my brain.
[22:09] <Scrippy> But I'd probably keep it backed up pretty well.
[22:09] <Azathoth> and pow, another big bang
[22:09] <chromium24> Azathoth, the only problem is that light that goes away from the rest of the universe is lost forever, so every iteration would be significantly smaller
[22:09] <Overlord> to you are talking about a GNAB GIB
[22:09] <Azathoth> well how does light propogate?
[22:09] <Scrippy> Well, is it lost forever or is it just still at the edge of the universe?
[22:09] <Scrippy> There's nothing for it to reflect off of
[22:09] <chromium24> It just goes on forever
[22:09] <Scrippy> As far as we know.
[22:10] <chromium24> space expands faster than light travels
[22:10] <Scrippy> For now.
[22:10] <chromium24> So there will always be more ground to cover, so to speak
[22:10] <Scrippy> It's in flux.
[22:10] <Azathoth> but do we even know how light propogates through a vacuum?
[22:10] <Scrippy> Eventually the expansion will become a retraction.

[22:11] <Overlord> Light is it's own medium
[22:11] <Scrippy> Light is a particle and a wave.

[22:13] <Scrippy> How does that even work?

[22:13] <Demki> LIGHT IS LIGHT!
[22:13] <chromium24> It's a theoretical thing that interacts either nearly- or totally-exclusively by gravitation
[22:13] <Marach-07> light is dark
[22:13] <Azathoth> so a massive source of gravity at the center of the universe could pull it all back :P

[22:14] <Marach-07> we don't know
[22:14] <chromium24> Overlord, good questions
[22:14] <Demki> Define length
[22:14] <chromium24> Feel free to theorize within the observed phenomena
[22:14] <Overlord> Yes we do, it is the resistance to the pull of gravity
[22:14] <Overlord> that is mass
[22:15] <chromium24> ... That is the most awful and wrong thing I've ever heard
[22:15] <Demki> Overlord
[22:15] <rbos> I read a neat paper recently speculating that gravitation is an entropic force resulting from the quantum foam. He derived Newton's and Einstein's basic equations.
[22:15] <Demki> not really
[22:15] <Scrippy> Quantum foam?
[22:15] <Overlord> ok, so you want me to use science terms to restate what I said
[22:15] <bildramer> ........
[22:15] <Scrippy> Is that anything like Gak?
[22:16] <Azathoth> lol
[22:16] <bildramer> Overlord
[22:16] <bildramer> you have no idea
[22:16] <chromium24> rbos, if that was true and it all worked, and was proved by experimental data, I have no doubt that guy would be called the most important person in human history
[22:16] <Demki> DEFINE: length
[22:16] <bildramer> so gtfo or stfu
[22:16] <Scrippy> Einstein's equations are kinda flawed.
[22:17] <rbos> the basic idea is that gravity isn't a "force" like electromagnetism, requiring intermediary particles like gravitons, but is more like elasticity. It falls right out of holographic theory.
[22:17] <chromium24> Yeah they don't work at quantum measurements
[22:17] <Scrippy> The speed of light isn't exactly constant.

[22:17] <Demki> Define length
[22:17] <Overlord> Mass is the a numerical measure of an objects inertia
[22:17] <Scrippy> I'm not sure even how it worked.

[22:18] * Roujo (Mibbit@dsl-103-42.rocler.com) has joined #minecraft
[22:18] <Overlord> Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to a change in its state of motion
[22:18] <Overlord> mass is resisting the inertial pull of gravity
[22:18] <rbos> chromium24: here's a good start point - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_as_an_entropic_force - links to Verlinde's paper.
[22:18] <Demki> in other words, the ratio between acceleration and force...
[22:19] <Overlord> Explain how I am wrong about my statement
[22:20] <rbos> entropic gravity explains why gravity is almost nonexistent at small scales - since it's a statistical effect, it's negligible over short distances.
[22:20] <rbos> anyway, see that link. :)
[22:20] <Overlord> Yes, I have read that paper
[22:20] <chromium24> IF that is correct and gets backed by scientific data
[22:20] <chromium24> I'll give that guy a blowjob for free, no questions asked
[22:20] <rbos> hahah

[22:47] <Speljohan_> for my webserver
[22:47] <Marach-07> do you use anything else than IE?
[22:47] <Speljohan_> that's how awesome lighttpd is
[22:47] <TerraSleet> yes but i don't trust antivirus software :P
[22:47] <TerraSleet> i use firefox
[22:47] <Marach-07> if both are true, you can safely visit

[22:47] <TerraSleet> well you can check if you wnt

[22:56] <Fleur> no its not
[22:56] <Speljohan_> it is not
[22:56] <Speljohan_> not for windows anyways
[22:56] <Speljohan_> for linux it is
[22:56] <Marach-07> it is free for windows
[22:56] <Speljohan_> well, there is a free build for windows
[22:56] <Marach-07> if you know where to look
[22:56] <Speljohan_> but it's not the official one
[22:56] <Speljohan_> lol
[22:56] <AzureAngelic> mirc is technically free too
[22:56] <Speljohan_> i very much dislike mirc tho
[22:56] <Marach-07> Speljohan_: do you care? it's not even illegal
[22:57] <Speljohan_> MDI-windowing is awful
[22:57] <AzureAngelic> i've been using it for three years straight and all it does is make a popup when you start it
[22:57] <Marach-07> yeah. xchat doesn't
[22:57] <Speljohan_> it's sad tho
[22:57] <Speljohan_> there's no really good irc client
[22:57] <Speljohan_> xchat is half-assed with plenty of bugs
[22:57] <Speljohan_> mirc is bloated
[22:57] <Marach-07> bugs?? where
[22:57] <Marach-07> i see none
[22:57] <Marach-07> and mirc IS bloated
[22:57] <Speljohan_> the windows build has quite a few bugs Marach-07
[22:57] <Marach-07> Speljohan_: such as?
[22:58] <Speljohan_> i get random crashes
[22:58] <Speljohan_> memory leaks
[22:58] <Marach-07> well i don't.
[22:58] <Marach-07> it never crashed

[23:02] <Speljohan_> cus my school paid for license
[23:02] <rbos> it's hard to get productive in a new IDE fast
[23:02] <Speljohan_> true
[23:02] <Speljohan_> takes some time to get used to
[23:02] <Speljohan_> hence why most people never switch
[23:02] <Marach-07> idea is strange.
[23:02] <Speljohan_> i started with eclipse but ended up switching to idea
[23:02] <Speljohan_> cus it was so much more efficient

[23:05] <Marach-07> ah i understand.
[23:05] <rbos> apostrophe misuse is like brain rape :(
[23:05] <Marach-07> ie. "i have 2 mobile phone's"
[23:05] <Marach-07> i hate that too
[23:05] <Speljohan_> especially http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/index.html
[23:05] <Speljohan_> the technologies it supports out of the box is amazing
[23:05] <Speljohan_> and the integration is really focused on productivity!
[23:06] <Marach-07> gimp isn't bad. you just need a week to set it up properly and you can actually do something in it
[23:06] <Marach-07> like a super mario bros spritesheet

[23:08] <Fleur> inb4 more stupididty
[23:08] <rbos> my preference for free software is more a moral than a practical stance; I'm more of the RMS school of thought that the right to modify your software ought to be universal
[23:08] <AzureAngel> [10053] Software caused connection abort
[23:08] <AzureAngel> i get this every time i connect to espernet
[23:08] <Litestrider> Is there any good way to build bridges and the like on floating levels, or do you just have to spam save/load like there's no tomorrow?
[23:08] <Speljohan_> i used to be like that rbos
[23:08] <Speljohan_> then i realized it's not the way works
[23:08] <Speljohan_> and it never will
[23:08] <Speljohan_> sad truths
[23:09] <sppt_> owow Speljohan_ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Spu7FWs8ik this is epic
[23:09] <bildramer> Stupid homework time.
[23:09] <rbos> Speljohan_: I realize that, and when it's someone else's money and time, I'll switch to the "better is better" approach
[23:09] <Speljohan_> :P
[23:09] <bildramer> We have a text of mythology from a random tribe in a random country
[23:09] <rbos> but when it's my own money and time I'll generally pull for the OSS solution even if it sucks a little more
[23:09] <rbos> like, android vs iphone
[23:09] <bildramer> and the homework is:
[23:09] <Speljohan_> well iphone is a piece of shit
[23:09] <Speljohan_> so the choice is obvious in that case
[23:09] <Marach-07> iphone is.
[23:10] <bildramer> "What do you think is scientifically true/possible? What is fantasy?"
[23:10] <Marach-07> ipod touch is awesome though
[23:10] <sppt_> what, android inferior to iphone? WHAT IS THIS
