[5:05] <Visiiri> In the first version you escape.
[5:05] <CyborgDragon> to bridge portal 1 and portal 2
[5:05] <CyborgDragon> no in the first version you lay there and black out
[5:05] <Snake> To create hype for Portal 2 as well
[5:05] <CyborgDragon> now you lay there and get dragged away by a robot
[5:05] <Visiiri> CyborgDragon:... you just destroyed the whole fucking thing.
[5:05] <Shrub> rawr

[5:07] <gordenfreechmen> is it possible to put a door on ice
[5:07] <Snake> Probably not
[5:07] <CyborgDragon> no gordenfreechmen it isn't
[5:07] <gordenfreechmen> damn
[5:08] <CyborgDragon> for the same reason you cant put a door on glass or fancy leaves
[5:08] <Shrub> you can't put a door on glass?

[5:09] <Visiiri> when you meet the great duku tree

[5:09] <Pl0x> I just loaded a game with the hacked grass block in it.
[5:09] <CyborgDragon> and how pl0x?
[5:09] <Pl0x> and it's messed up
[5:09] <CyborgDragon> how so?
[5:09] <Pl0x> because all the sides are the sides
[5:10] <Pl0x> like the texture
[5:10] <Pl0x> is not grass on top
[5:10] <Pl0x> it's like the side of the block on the top
[5:10] <CyborgDragon> no pl0x, notch changed how grass works
[5:10] <gordenfreechmen> it does the same thing with tilled soil
[5:10] <Pl0x> oh
[5:10] <CyborgDragon> it actually changes textures now, like tilled soil

[5:12] <Kokopure> lighting your ice base is hard

[5:12] <CyborgDragon> pl0x, you kind of discovered it
[5:13] <CyborgDragon> most people discovered it
[5:13] <Pl0x> I don't think, I like snowy world.
[5:13] <CyborgDragon> they just didnt communicate to others about the fact, mostly
[5:13] <Pl0x> at night it's hard to see.
[5:13] <Visiiri> Use the red torches
[5:13] <Visiiri> they don't melt.
[5:13] <Pl0x> I need red ore
[5:13] <gordenfreechmen> Visiiri: good idea

[5:48] <SireTRM> CyborgDragon, can I have the may, anyways?
[5:48] <SireTRM> Map*
[5:49] <CyborgDragon> especially the creeper sounds, which sound like the creeper failing to ignite
[5:49] <Mojo-Rizan> What's in todays update guys?
[5:49] * Kokopure is now known as Koko|TF2
[5:49] <Superwafflez> snow.
[5:49] <SireTRM> Snow
[5:49] <SireTRM> Lots of snow
[5:49] <SireTRM> Iced oceans.
[5:49] <Mojo-Rizan> what button does that?
[5:49] <CyborgDragon> sure SireTRM , i mean, it is my epic map with a naturally generated crater going down to the adminium layer
[5:49] <SireTRM> Create world
[5:49] <Mojo-Rizan> oh I see.
[5:49] <Mojo-Rizan> SO it's all snow or...?
[5:49] <CyborgDragon> mojo, you just have to generate worlds until you get one
[5:49] <CyborgDragon> it's a chance thing
[5:50] <Mojo-Rizan> oh, so it IS a full snow or not world.
[5:50] <Mojo-Rizan> I see.
[5:50] <SireTRM> There are snow "thin" blocks that spawn and there is a snow animation.
[5:50] <Epsilon1> i like the snow but not it's lag on my laptop...
[5:50] <AwesomeTrout> For some people it took one try, for others (like me) it took 13 tries...
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> it took me 20 tries
[5:50] <SireTRM> I got two in like 20 tries.
[5:50] <Utriax> I am so gonna try that pokemon cave song in a minecraft cave. XD
[5:50] <Epsilon1> it took 1 try :P
[5:50] <Epsilon1> for me
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> well, actually it took me 3 tries after my friend tried 17 times on my computer
[5:50] <SireTRM> Actually, maybe 8 times.
[5:50] <Superwafflez> so next friday... SMP and biomes
[5:51] <Shrub74> Maybe.
[5:51] <Mojo-Rizan> Serious?

[5:51] <SireTRM> Sounds good. We will see how far Notch gets.
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> no, next friday is another seecret, thursday will be SMP
[5:51] <Mojo-Rizan> Anyway, I'm gonna give it a shot and tell you how many tries it took.
[5:51] <Epsilon1> i like the idea of biomes...
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> SMP won't be a seecret friday update, notch said that
[5:51] <Utriax> biomes?
[5:51] <Epsilon1> i like seasons better
[5:51] <Mojo-Rizan> what's biomes?
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> guys
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> i got it
[5:51] <Vicrry_> I only had to try once to get snow :P
[5:51] <SireTRM> Different map gen areas
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> next friday, seasons+biomes!
[5:51] * AwesomeTrout is now known as TheAwesomeTrout
[5:51] <Epsilon1> lol
[5:51] <maseck> snow goes through glass, OMG!!!
[5:51] <Utriax> What are these biomeses? >:o
[5:52] <Superwafflez> it wont be a secret friday update, yeah
[5:52] <SireTRM> Seasons. I protest.
[5:52] <TheAwesomeTrout> Snow makes a good carpet though...
[5:52] <CyborgDragon> sireTRM, boohoo, notch has said he will add it
[5:52] <Superwafflez> but it could still be released on friday with other secret stuff
[5:52] <SireTRM> maseck, transparent blocks are treated as air.
[5:52] <Epsilon1> lol
[5:52] <SireTRM> I want to be able to toggle all this junk. . .
[5:52] <SireTRM> Mobs, seasons, day/night. . .
[5:52] <Epsilon1> i put a minecart on ice...
[5:52] <CyborgDragon> sireTRM, notch will optimize the game eventually, it's just an alpha at the moment
[5:52] <Epsilon1> it fell through
[5:53] <Vicrry_> lol
[5:53] <SireTRM> I want cute little slider bars. . .
[5:53] <maseck> I understand, I'm just suprised
[5:53] <CyborgDragon> also, if you dont want mobs, go to creative
[5:53] <Superwafflez> creative will be updated too
[5:53] <CyborgDragon> infdev creative, whenever notch makes it, will probably have all those options
[5:53] <SireTRM> No, I want to control what spawns and such.
[5:53] <TheAwesomeTrout> Or set difficulty to peaceful
[5:53] <CyborgDragon> but survival itself will have it all on, be default
[5:53] <SireTRM> Customization, I'll just wait and hope.
[5:53] <CyborgDragon> and not able to turn off except mob spawns

[5:54] <Epsilon1> you mean... ill have signsin the creative mode!?
[5:54] <DEElekgolo> quick question
[5:54] <Utriax> does peacefull remove mobs orsomthing? or just the chance of seeing them? ;o
[5:54] <DEElekgolo> http://www.minecraft.net/docs/levelformat.jsp
[5:54] <SireTRM> Utriax, it removes hostile mobs
[5:54] <DEElekgolo> where it says
[5:54] <DEElekgolo> Index = x + (y * Depth + z) * Width
[5:54] <Utriax> lowering the chance*
[5:54] <DEElekgolo> is depth the mac height?
[5:54] <TheAwesomeTrout> It removes the mobs, leaves pigs and sheep in
[5:54] <CyborgDragon> i see no question there dDEE
[5:54] <Pl0x> Video down yet CyborgDragon?
[5:54] <Utriax> oh oke :3
[5:54] <Pl0x> done *
[5:54] <TheAwesomeTrout> And also gives regenerative health
[5:54] <SireTRM> +.5 hp/second
[5:54] <DEElekgolo> hte the depth the height of the map?
[5:54] <DEElekgolo> Index = x + (y * Depth + z) * Width
[5:54] <DEElekgolo> in that equasion
[5:54] <CyborgDragon> no pl0x, youtube is being slow
[5:55] <gordenfreechmen> im making a huge cloth igloo with an ice foundation
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> not sure DEE
[5:55] <Epsilon1> :O!!! I Found a golden apple!!!
[5:55] <Superwafflez> 64k internet, what do
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> i think so
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> epsilon, we know
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> golden apples are in the dungeons sometimes, same for apples
[5:55] <DEElekgolo> im sure Animator would know
[5:55] <AndrewPH> DEElekgolo, what makes you think he would
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> and the apple>golden apple recipe is completely bogus, just some idiot trying to troll everybody
[5:55] <Epsilon1> wait... i have a idea...
[5:55] <Mojo-Rizan> What is it?
[5:56] <gordenfreechmen> why would you eat an apple covered with gold
[5:56] <AndrewPH> gordenfreechmen, it's not covered in gold
[5:56] <Superwafflez> trees need to grow apples already
[5:56] <AndrewPH> it's a golden apple
[5:56] <Epsilon1> i can use NBT Edit to find the dec of the golden apple!
[5:56] <CyborgDragon> gorden, golden apples heal 8 hearts
[5:56] <CyborgDragon> epsilon -.-
[5:56] <gordenfreechmen> AndrewPH: i meant if the recipe was true
[5:56] <CyborgDragon> epsilon1: http://copy.bplaced.net/mc/Items/
[5:56] <gordenfreechmen> its implying the golden apple is an apple covered with gold
[5:57] <CyborgDragon> oops

[6:00] <Pl0x> wtf
[6:01] <maseck> does minecraft have the "on ice" as one of those thingies yet
[6:01] <Pl0x> people are saying

[6:02] <CyborgDragon> and also what superwafflez said
[6:02] <Pl0x> Chris Gallian: " Hes not lying dude, I generated a snow map two days ago. I have no idea how rare this is or w/e, but apparently not many other people have seen snow yet... Im personally looking for the secret update as we speak. So far I'm hearing something new (like heavy breathing and screeching sounds)."
[6:02] <Epsilon1> troll
[6:03] <CyborgDragon> so either they're lying dumbasses, like that guy who tried to add "ice dragons" to the wiki, or they're trolling, or they're just dumbasses

[6:06] <Visiiri> Yeah, really
[6:06] <Shrub> I bet you secretly can.
[6:06] <Visiiri> You just need to mine it with a diamond pickaxe
[6:06] <Visiiri> then smelt it

[6:12] <gordenfreechmen> thats going to bug me
[6:12] <Epsilon1> no i hae a cheat level and a real level...
[6:12] * Schaap is now known as SchaapSleep
[6:12] <CyborgDragon> adminium fortress is just really lame
[6:12] <raquzzic> So adminium is destroyable? I wonder how long it takes bare-handed
[6:12] <Epsilon1> well non-cheat level
[6:12] * wolf_alex (chatzilla@bas1-orleans06-1176115557.dsl.bell.ca) has left #minecraft
[6:12] * tak (tak@72.183.125.48) has joined #minecraft
[6:12] <CyborgDragon> no idea raquzzic
[6:12] <Diablodoct0r> Can you blow adminium with tnt?
[6:13] <raquzzic> ill assume 10 minutes
[6:13] <Epsilon1> no
[6:13] <CyborgDragon> no diablo you cant
[6:13] <Diablodoct0r> shame
[6:13] <CyborgDragon> no raquzzic, longer
[6:13] <LKA> wasnt admin bedrock used for tnt cannons
[6:13] <Epsilon1> i tried :P
[6:13] <raquzzic> half an hour?
[6:13] <Shrub> Cannons?
[6:13] <Diablodoct0r> Now to think of it, there should be some kind of block you could ONLY mine using TNT
[6:13] <LKA> or rather, tnt shotguns
[6:13] <LKA> considering how they behaved
[6:13] <Diablodoct0r> That way, there would be a reason to use TNT in PvP
[6:13] <Shrub> what do you put in cannons? O.o
[6:13] <Diablodoct0r> Like in Lord of the rings
[6:13] <LKA> way too many blocks of TNT for them to be useful thats for sure
[6:13] <Armonte> obsidian
[6:14] <Diablodoct0r> Hey now,
[6:14] <Epsilon1> cannon ammo = iron block
[6:14] <Diablodoct0r> I asked Notch to make Obsidian immune to TNT
[6:14] <Diablodoct0r> And erm,
[6:14] <Diablodoct0r> If he does
[6:14] <Shrub> Does it actually hurt anything?
[6:14] <Diablodoct0r> We can have cannons made of Obsidian
[6:14] <Diablodoct0r> !
[6:14] <CyborgDragon> bleh, BC Headache Powder
[6:14] <CyborgDragon> shit's so nasty
[6:14] <Shrub> drink water.
[6:14] <CyborgDragon> uhh, obsidian breaks to TNT
[6:14] <Diablodoct0r> I know
[6:14] <Diablodoct0r> But I asked Notch to change that
[6:14] <Shrub> lrn2read
[6:14] <raquzzic> a ballista to my knowledge takes 6 tnt, and it takes a least 15 dead creepers to get enough gun powder... You would need a creeper dungeon!
[6:15] <LKA> well if you dont consider roughly 25+ blocks of tnt flying out of an admin bedrock tube at awkward angles to be deadly then no it doesnt hurt anything
[6:15] <LKA> .. except maybe the map
[6:15] <Drakkar> man
[6:15] <Diablodoct0r> Read:
[6:15] <Drakkar> it'd be nice if monsters had more specific enviroments to spawn in
[6:15] <Drakkar> like
[6:15] <Diablodoct0r> (19:29:18) (Diablodoct0r) Notch: I'd like to request that Obsidian is immune to explosions. That way, if you work extremely hard for 22 years, your base won't actually be destroyed by the first creeper after all :)
[6:15] <Diablodoct0r> (19:29:23) (Draconicus) Kyto: Nope. Just kind of busy in here when Notch is around
[6:15] <Diablodoct0r> (19:29:41) (@Notch) i shall make it so!
[6:15] <Epsilon1> wow!
[6:15] <CyborgDragon> HOLY SHIT DIABLO
[6:15] <CyborgDragon> AWESOME
[6:15] <Shrub> HOYL FUCK!
[6:15] <Diablodoct0r> This was long ago, so I don't know if he remembered it
[6:15] * CyborgDragon highfives diablo
[6:16] * Diablodoct0r hi5's
[6:16] <Drakkar> as far as zombies and skeletons go
[6:16] <gordenfreechmen> man. i really wish cave ambiences were toggable
[6:16] <LKA> though they might become *slightly* more practical considering the redstone dust can be used to remote detonate tnt but still youd need a creeper dungeon to farm the gunpowder required
[6:16] * CyborgDragon pulls hand back and watches diablo fall from unbalance
[6:16] <Drakkar> it'd be nice if sectors you murdered animals in
[6:16] <gordenfreechmen> i heard his NNNNNNNEEEERRRRRR instrument noise play
[6:16] <Diablodoct0r> lol
[6:16] <Drakkar> would gradually become more and more dangerous
[6:16] <Drakkar> and BAM
[6:16] <Shrub> I walked into my base and there was a creeper RIGHT THERE
[6:16] <Drakkar> ONE DAY
[6:16] <Drakkar> ZOMBIES AND SKELETONS EVERYWHERE
[6:16] <LKA> and cave ambience more like having a mountainside randomly roar at you

[6:23] * Epsilon1 is now known as failure
[6:23] <Diablodoct0r> A pig just twitched his eyes at me
[6:23] <Diablodoct0r> How is that possible?
[6:23] <Diablodoct0r> >_>
[6:23] <Pl0x> it's a spy
[6:23] <gordenfreechmen> texture glitch probably
[6:24] <failure> lol
[6:24] <Pl0x> NO
[6:24] <Pl0x> it's a SPY
[6:24] <Diablodoct0r> xD
[6:24] <failure> maybe a update
[6:24] <raquzzic> d-d-d-d-down t-t-t-o bedr-r-r-ock???
[6:24] <Diablodoct0r> Well I love that glitch
[6:24] <failure> :P
[6:24] <Drakkar> wait
[6:24] <Diablodoct0r> notch should make it a permanent feature
[6:24] <Shrub> I wonder if snow would fall down a hole and make snow on bedrock
[6:24] <Drakkar> there is actually ice

[6:24] <Diablodoct0r> twitching pigs
[6:24] <Pl0x> Shrub: try it
[6:24] <Drakkar> also
[6:24] <CyborgDragon> the crater is naturally generated, and goes down to the bedrock
[6:24] <Drakkar> twitching pigs would be kind of creepy
[6:24] <Shrub> D:
[6:24] <Shrub> awesome cyborg
[6:24] <raquzzic> why do i never find these caves anywhere?
[6:24] <Diablodoct0r> xD
[6:24] <Diablodoct0r> indeed
[6:24] <Pl0x> twitching creeper
[6:25] <Diablodoct0r> I mean the twitching was cute
[6:25] <Diablodoct0r> It made me just stare into his eyes
[6:25] <raquzzic> i love massive, deep world caves
[6:25] <Epsilon1> i think zombies suit this feature
[6:25] <CyborgDragon> 3 minutes remaining on the video processing
[6:25] <Diablodoct0r> dudes I am keeping this pig
[6:25] <raquzzic> they are very likely to have diamonds!

[6:25] <Shrub> That pig could be in our stomach
[6:25] <Epsilon1> and... if chickens are created... what will zombies drop?
[6:25] <Pl0x> CyborgDragon: How come I started with nothing on your save?
[6:26] <CyborgDragon> raquzzic, the cave does indeed have diamonds and red ore
[6:26] <raquzzic> zombies will drop twigs!
[6:26] <Diablodoct0r> I'll call him...

[6:33] <raquzzic> i herd them, defiantly impactive, but not HOLY FUCKING SHIR BRAWAWAWA like how people describe them.
[6:34] <Drakkar> yeah no they're pretty mild
[6:34] <Drakkar> and rare too
[6:34] <Drakkar> they're surprising though haha
[6:34] <raquzzic> i like cave3 the most
[6:34] <Drakkar> like you're just exploring and after an hour
[6:34] <raquzzic> and cave5

[6:34] <Drakkar> what the fuck

[6:36] <Pl0x> so CyborgDragon are you going to cut the movie?
[6:36] <Pl0x> video *
[6:36] <Drakkar> well i think notch has zoning sectors
[6:36] <CyborgDragon> i am
[6:36] <CyborgDragon> as we speak
[6:36] <Drakkar> its hard to explain
[6:36] <Pl0x> :)
[6:36] <Drakkar> but long story short
[6:36] <Drakkar> if you're in a given area
[6:36] <Drakkar> and it matches certain criteria that boil down to 'cave'
[6:36] <Drakkar> then you'll hear the sounds at random intervals
[6:37] <Aeomin> well, the map generator generates caves using seed provided in level.dat
[6:37] <Aeomin> so it knows where
[6:37] <Drakkar> yeah
[6:37] <Drakkar> but
[6:37] <Drakkar> the thing is it needs to keep track of exactly what determines a cave and what doesn't
[6:38] <raquzzic> paranormal is apparently what the theme is in caves. Now we just need some poltergeists and sound to actually work with minecraft on a mac!
[6:38] <CyborgDragon> aeomin, c418 said no one has figured out how cave sounds work yet, and one of the suggestions at the time of him saying that were already that it uses the "cave seeds"
[6:38] <Drakkar> which is doable as long as it can just check the seed
[6:38] <CyborgDragon> meaning, it's not the cave seeds
[6:38] <Drakkar> anyway
[6:38] <Drakkar> it doesn't really matter
[6:38] <raquzzic> why not just ask notch?
[6:38] <Drakkar> they're fantastic though
[6:38] <Drakkar> are they gone now?
[6:38] <Pl0x> he's away
[6:38] <raquzzic> when possible
[6:38] <Pl0x> you can't ask him if he's away

[6:39] <Aeomin> not using seeds eh.. that means it works with man made caves
[6:39] <ClassiestMedic> what are the cave sounds like
[6:39] <raquzzic> i wish sound for minecraft worked on mac
[6:39] <ClassiestMedic> i can't play MC, so
[6:39] <raquzzic> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvamUrTIzjY LIKE THIS!
[6:39] <Azrooh> I'm pretty sure the cave noises have a chance to play if its dark where you're standing o.O
[6:39] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[6:40] <Aeomin> maybe.. try in a house?
[6:40] <CyborgDragon> i've heard cave sounds under a tree
[6:40] <Azrooh> I have gotten one when putting the roof on a new house, yes
[6:40] <Pl0x> wtf the rawr one scared the shit out of me

[6:40] <Pl0x> GUISE
[6:40] <Aeomin> so likely is based on light
[6:40] <Pl0x> Listen to the rawr one
[6:40] <Azrooh> ?

[7:51] <Grapist> So I dressed up as some grapes and broke into innocent children's rooms at some point or another...
[7:52] <Grapist> Who hasn't?!
[7:52] <Tukiko> Really
[7:52] <shisno> I pointed out that the clit wasnt the whole vagina to.. her.
[7:52] <Tukiko> Everyone does that
[7:52] <shisno> And she decided to randomly log out of msn
[7:52] <shisno> then when I pm her on YIM,
[7:52] <shisno> she?s like
[7:52] <Tukiko> Well stop RPing with idiots.
[7:52] <shisno> ?Fucking msn died.? ?Wanna continue on here?? ?g2g somewhere in 5 minutes?
[7:52] <shisno> I dont mind rping with her.
[7:52] <shisno> Even if she isnt female.
[7:52] <shisno> /shrug

[7:54] <Tukiko> Well, I guess storage or something.
[7:54] <shisno> therefore, base 3? :3
[7:54] <Tukiko> How are dualists opposed to binary?
[7:54] <Tukiko> Aren't dualists opposed to anything that isn't binary?
[7:55] <Grapist> Rideable horses that move faster than you can walk. There.
[7:55] <shisno> ?he term 'dualism' was originally coined to denote co-eternal binary opposition, a meaning that is ?
[7:55] <shisno> -shrug-
[7:55] <Tukiko> But we already walk rather fast
[7:55] <Grapist> But the horse would be faster D:
[7:55] <Azrooh> Horses wouldn't really fit in with the whole minecraft theme imo
[7:55] <Grapist> ? Really?
[7:55] <Azrooh> Yeah. You see a cave. What do you do?
[7:55] <Grapist> Get off the horse

[7:57] <Grapist> Sweet
[7:57] <Grapist> I'm totally pumped for multiplayer survival
[7:57] <Dezerus> So am I.

[7:58] <Dezerus> I hope I get a snow map...
[7:58] <Animator> Jesus Christ, I am locking topics and banning people at the speed of light today.
[7:58] <Dezerus> They aren't, unless needed.
[7:58] <Grapist> ?
[7:58] <Dezerus> You want your land? Work for it.
[7:58] <Azrooh> Land claim flags aren't going to be put in, lol
[7:58] <Grapist> They're on the todo list
[7:58] <Azrooh> The people that don't understand that admins will be enforcing the servers they're in want them in
[7:58] <Azrooh> ...They are? o.O
[7:59] <Dezerus> Not unless Notch thinks they're necessary.
[7:59] <Grapist> I don't know if I'd want them though
[7:59] <PuyoDead> Yea, you beat me to mememepoome, Ani.
[7:59] <PuyoDead> I was looking at that mess at the same time you were.
[7:59] <Grapist> Because part of me really really really wants to be able to go fuck other people over and steal their shit.
[7:59] <raquzzic> @animator hw many banned today?

[7:59] <Animator> Spambot, and 2 trolls.
[7:59] <Azrooh> I REALLY hope these are optional
[7:59] <Dezerus> You will be able to... Just don't get caught.
[7:59] <Azrooh> Because I do not want these in my server :|
[7:59] <mnjiman> Hes been following the list pretty well
[8:00] <Azrooh> Dezerus, you won't be able to if land claim flags are in
[8:00] <Dezerus> If you're caught, ban.
[8:00] <Snake> Grapist: Same here actually. The thrill of robbing someone.
[8:00] <Dezerus> Notch isn't adding those.
[8:00] <Snake> Just seems like fun.
[8:00] <Azrooh> It's right there on the to-do list
[8:00] <Azrooh> Put under 'someday'
[8:00] <Dezerus> He's said he won't add them unless they're needed.
[8:00] <Azrooh> Ah, I see
[8:00] <Grapist> Yeah, a lot of the fun will be missing if people can just buy guaranteed safety
[8:00] <Dezerus> Which is why they're under Someday.
[8:01] <mnjiman> Ya so dont say he isnt adding those
[8:01] <mnjiman> we dont know
[8:01] <mnjiman> you dont know
[8:01] <mnjiman> it depends on how things progress
[8:01] <Snake> Notch may not even know.
[8:01] <mnjiman> ya
[8:01] <Animator> Bam.
[8:01] <Grapist> Just imagine organizing raids and shit
[8:01] <Azrooh> Meh. It's not a problem if he does add them.
[8:02] <Azrooh> If they're not optional I'll just put not to use them in the rules and destroy the shit of anyone that does.
[8:02] <Grapist> Hey, let's all go storm over to that prick's house on that hill and steal his crap. HURRAH!
[8:02] <Dezerus> Dynamite: if you have enough, it's worth it.

[8:03] <Grapist> And you just know that eventually people will start building castles and there will be wars of epic proportions
[8:03] <Grapist> I can hardly contain myself

[8:04] <raquzzic> I wanna make a minecraft campaign actually, were you must be at war with the skeleton mafia!
[8:04] <Dezerus> Just make sure they can't break your walls...
[8:04] <Tukiko> Imagine the underground battles and luring of mobs to people's houses
[8:04] <Azrooh> Zombie siege will rock.
[8:04] <Grapist> I will make a house made of obsidian and diamond.
[8:04] <Tukiko> lol
[8:04] <Iguana> I'm 15 now yay
[8:04] <raquzzic> undrground battles with bows and arrows? fucking awesome!
[8:04] <Tukiko> Until someone gets an iron pickaxe, mines your diamond, and then your obsidian
[8:04] <Dezerus> Inner layers of lava between layers of stone will be an excellent strategy.
[8:04] <Snake> Grats, Iggy.
[8:04] <Azrooh> I hope notch makes arrows easier to get, lol
[8:04] <shisno> easier?

[8:08] <shisno> so iron isnt really too rare

[8:10] <Grapist> And one 56 stack
[8:10] <Snake> Grapist: Nou
[8:10] <Snake> I could never find any
[8:10] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Eventually, yes, you can amass a lot of iron, but at an early point in the game when you're NOT super well-equipped and resources matter, it takes 2 iron to make a sword that lasts for many, many enemies, but that only makes enough arrows for 2.
[8:10] <Snake> D:
[8:10] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Nobody believes you as it is, shisno
[8:10] <shisno> play on peaceful for an hour.
[8:10] <Azrooh> Enough enemies for 2?
[8:10] <shisno> I did ;\

[9:09] <Superwafflez> shoulda filled it level by level

[9:22] <Tukiko> I can still farm
[9:22] <Scribble> Then how do I do it?
[9:22] <Azrooh> If you're in a snowy area you'll need to farm underground

[9:22] <Scribble> Imean
[9:22] <Rooster1> Scribble, you can farm in Alpha
[9:23] <Scribble> Hoe on dirt just destroys it
[9:23] <Azrooh> Gotta hoe on grass, then you have a chance of getting a seed

[9:23] <Azrooh> It'll grow
[9:23] <Azrooh> As long as it has light that is
[9:23] <Scribble> I think that's the problem, I'm not plowing, just destroying.

[9:54] <pl0x> Global Warming.... I'm sick of that word.
[9:54] <Roy> Yea, global warming is a lie imo :P
[9:54] <Tukiko> Global warming itself is not a lie, but humans causing it is total bull.

[9:58] <Tukiko> People seem to forget that in order for the Earth's temperature on a global scale to remain relatively constant each year, whenever some place encounters a heat wave someplace else must encounter a.. cold wave I guess it's called?
[9:58] <Tukiko> Hot + cold = :)
[9:58] <Askee> Cause and effect :D
[9:58] <Askee> One place heating up will cause another to cool :3
[9:59] <Shadaez> Great, no idea where I played the Android SDK.
[9:59] <Tukiko> Lol, usually when I tell people that and it's really hot out they say "That's not true! I'm sure it's really hot elsewhere too." So I remind them of the existence of the southern hemisphere.
[9:59] <Askee> The weather of a location basicly depends on high altitue wind, and ocean currents

[10:49] <pl0x> TTL = Title Title language.
[10:49] <Tukiko> It's Time To Live
[10:49] <pl0x> na I dunno.
[10:50] <Tukiko> Not sure what it does, though.
[10:50] <vede> Shadaez, set it to 0.
[10:50] <vede> Set all of them to 0.
[10:50] <Shadaez> I think it's just how long till it happens
[10:50] <Shadaez> there's no 0
[10:50] <vede> Then 1.
[10:50] <Tukiko> Well then
[10:50] <Shadaez> 1/2 hour is least amount

[11:01] <TheMilkMan> There isn't even currency in minecraft yet, let alone a waffle maker...
[11:01] <mnjiman> use Iron as currency
[11:01] <TheMilkMan> You guys nuts...
[11:01] <Visiiri> There's currency.
[11:01] <Visiiri> If there's goods, there's currency.
[11:01] <TheMilkMan> Oh?
[11:01] <Tukiko> Use gold as currency.
[11:01] <Visiiri> Gold is worthless.
[11:01] <mnjiman> gold isnt a used item
[11:01] <TheMilkMan> And where will I use this so called nonexistent currency? A creeper?
[11:01] <mnjiman> its worthless
[11:02] <Visiiri> Gold achieves nothing.
[11:02] <Tukiko> Like I said, currency
[11:02] <mnjiman> Iron would be worth more
[11:02] <Visiiri> TheMilkMan: If there's good, there's currency.
[11:02] <TheMilkMan> Nah
[11:02] <Visiiri> Yes.
[11:02] <Visiiri> Learn2economics
[11:02] <Rooster> Coal is going to be worth the most.
[11:02] <Tukiko> Say iron = 5 gold, then suddenly gold has a use
[11:02] <TheMilkMan> If that were the case gold would be currency.
[11:02] <Rooster> in the long run IMO
[11:02] <Visiiri> ...
[11:02] <mnjiman> Money = gold in banks and shit
[11:02] <mnjiman> etc
[11:02] <mnjiman> value given to it
[11:02] <mnjiman> etc
[11:02] <mnjiman> etc
[11:02] <Rooster> ^
[11:02] <mnjiman> economics
[11:02] <mnjiman> etc
[11:02] <TheMilkMan> Paper painted green has no use, I deem it of no value....
[11:03] <Shadaez> mnjiman no you're dumb
[11:03] <Tukiko> Money is worthless, gold has worth
[11:03] <Tukiko> Therefore I propose we use iron as money
[11:03] <Visiiri> TheMilkMan: This is MINECRAFT we're talking about.
[11:03] <mnjiman> O my bad Shadaez ill KILL MYSELF then
[11:03] <TheMilkMan> You're talking about currency though...
[11:03] <Visiiri> The currency is clearly going to be the ores.
[11:03] <TheMilkMan> Currency can't be an item you use...
[11:03] <Gunmage> I hope people accept gold as currency
[11:03] <Shadaez> mnjiman no don't :(
[11:03] <Visiiri> Ores -> Have function.
[11:03] <mnjiman> yes it can\
[11:03] <Tukiko> Visiiri: If you want a currency then you need to use something that actually makes sense, and not dirt.
[11:03] <Rooster> Gold is only valuable because we have chosen it's value. Minecrafts currency will be something tangible, I don't think you can just create a capitialest economy in one day.
[11:03] <TheMilkMan> Because then it's not currency it's a necesity that you use.
[11:03] <mnjiman> That the god dam point
[11:03] <Gunmage> Gold thus far is useless
[11:03] <Gunmage> Also did I spy magic in the dev blog?
[11:03] <mnjiman> currency is viewed as something with value, ANYTHING of value
[11:04] <Gunmage> He actually plans on alchemy? :D
[11:04] <TheMilkMan> I'll trade diamond for gold once smp is out
[11:04] <Shadaez> economies will be different on every server
[11:04] <Rooster> Gunmage: where
[11:04] <Shadaez> Hopefully gold is the currency on the server I play on
[11:04] <TheMilkMan> and make a gold castle
[11:04] <mnjiman> It also has to be agreed upon by the majority as tradable
[11:04] <Rooster> I don't there will be economics, it seems way to easy to steal stuff right now.
[11:04] <Visiiri> That's stupid.
[11:04] <sired22> say is there any material that completely stops tnt?
[11:04] <Foe> :l
[11:04] <Visiiri> If it does nothing, why would you want to have it?
[11:04] <TheMilkMan> If i were to go to a newly created esrver and made a shop that used gold
[11:04] <TheMilkMan> eventually everyone would use gold
[11:04] <mnjiman> If gold was actually pretty

[11:04] <Gunmage> fits fairly well with the pseudo fantasy theme of Minecraft, and it will certainly have more uses in the future, mainly for alchemy and possibly other forms of magic.
[11:04] <Visiiri> No
[11:04] <TheMilkMan> this is to say I'm the first shop to do that
[11:04] <Visiiri> Not at all
[11:04] <Visiiri> If your shop has things that people want
[11:04] <mnjiman> and useful
[11:04] <Visiiri> maybe
[11:05] <Gunmage> Quoted straight from the word of notch.
[11:05] <Visiiri> Gunmage: Do we have that now?
[11:05] <Gunmage> So alchemy, woo
[11:05] <Visiiri> Fuck this
[11:05] <Gunmage> Not that I see
[11:05] <mnjiman> right at this moment,
[11:05] <TheMilkMan> I'm gonna be the full metal alchemist hurr derr
[11:05] <Gunmage> Unless you count redstuff
[11:05] <mnjiman> Iron is the best currency we would have
[11:05] <TheMilkMan> just gotta make a skin
[11:05] <mnjiman> its the most used and searched after
[11:05] <Tukiko> Red Crap might also be a currency, but that has a use so it's ill-fitting.
[11:05] <Gunmage> He probably just means conversions
[11:05] <Visiiri> Stone > Iron > Diamond
[11:05] <Visiiri> that would be the logical currency conversion
[11:06] <mnjiman> You cant make tracks out of diamonds
[11:06] <Gunmage> I will just be a hobo and use cobblestone
[11:06] <TheMilkMan> I will use my alchemy pwers to turn your castle to water MUAHAHAHA
[11:06] <Visiiri> But the diamond ends up in the hands of the workers
[11:06] <Gunmage> no
[11:06] <Gunmage> My castle will be ice by then

[11:07] <Visiiri> Not more time
[11:07] <Visiiri> More coal/resources.
[11:07] <Gunmage> I always prospect with cobblestone or wood picks
[11:07] <TheMilkMan> This is my plan, guys, I'm going to cut down every tree in the server before anyone else has a chance, and then have my own private tree farm no one knows about and sell wood for an extremely high price >:D

[11:08] <Visiiri> TheMilkMan: Just when did he say this?
[11:08] <Gunmage> At least 1 earth size
[11:08] <Visiiri> They WILL be infinite
[11:08] <Visiiri> infinite is part of the engine.

[11:09] <chevair> What are yall talkin 'bout?
[11:09] <Visiiri> He said that he would limit the player locations
[11:09] <mnjiman> Notch said that he would make Inf servers be the default, but allow players to make their servers static sized,.
[11:09] <TheMilkMan> ?
[11:09] <Visiiri> He wouldn't rewrite the engine for multiplayer
[11:09] * DimJim|sleep4 is now known as DimJim|sleep5
[11:09] <Visiiri> or he would've done that BEFORE infdev
[11:09] <mnjiman> Im
[11:09] <mnjiman> telling you what he said
[11:09] <mnjiman> so
[11:09] <mnjiman> ya

[11:10] <TheMilkMan> I can't follow you guys xD
[11:10] <sired22> http://imgur.com/KA3Kg.jpg - this is going to take forever to reach the bottom of the world but I'm determined.
[11:10] <Visiiri> TheMilkMan: No, the limit will be set by the admins.
[11:10] <Visiiri> The map still generates the same
[11:10] <TheMilkMan> Ah
[11:10] <Visiiri> That's what he said while in IRC
[11:10] <Tukiko> sired22: DIG STRAIGHT DOWN WOO

[11:12] <TheMilkMan> I maybe can get my clan leader from steam to host....
[11:12] <TheMilkMan> He used to host servers for other games...
[11:12] <TheMilkMan> Hmm idk...
[11:13] <Visiiri> mnjiman: He came in IRC last week
[11:13] <sired22> i hate pigs i have 2 large chests full of meat so now i just try and ignore them
[11:13] <TheMilkMan> Do you need the game to be able to host?
[11:13] <Visiiri> And this question came up
[11:13] <mnjiman> He said that Inf maps will take up alot of ram since it will create alot of chunks to be handled and created at the same time.

[11:16] <DimJim|sleep5> dirt could have small traces of iron
[11:16] <mnjiman> eh
[11:16] <mnjiman> almost all dirt does anyway
[11:16] <Rooster> It shouldn't be easy to get iron, I want refinerys.

[11:22] <Superwafflez> did he just dump a link in IRC?

[11:23] <Shadaez> man, godaddy.com sucks
[11:24] <Visiiri> He's been working on promising us multiplayer for two months.
[11:24] <Visiiri> I doubt it will work by this week.
[11:24] <Azrooh> that was just a link saying he's quitting his job soon.
[11:24] <Visiiri> Read the rest
[11:24] <Visiiri> :|
[11:24] <Azrooh> and notch has been driving hard on multiplayer lately.
[11:24] <Azrooh> he has the netcode done, and he has said he's testing it.
[11:24] <Azrooh> i'll try to find the links if you want.

[11:26] <Azrooh> ...so you think he's not going to release SMP because it has been on the drawing board for two months? o.O
[11:26] <Visiiri> Azrooh: You weren't in IRC with him talking about it.

[11:27] <mnjiman> anyways
[11:27] <mnjiman> ya
[11:27] <CyanRyan> this is implying that it will be out very soon
[11:27] <Visiiri> Issues = issues
[11:27] <Visiiri> progress != issue stopper
[11:27] <Azrooh> and now if he's testing it he has pretty much everything done most likely.

[13:16] <Vis{IDK}> or C?
[13:16] <St4ud3_> <_`Memainman> python = king <-- And its extremely easy to learn
[13:16] <Jackomel> C#
[13:16] <_`Memainman> cpp
[13:16] <bildramer> those are probably too hard
[13:16] <St4ud3_> c++

[13:17] <St4ud3_> Besides Java nothing counts :D
[13:17] <bildramer> Vis, what sort of GUI
[13:17] <bildramer> explain
[13:18] <Keiya> Vis{IDK}: Haskell!
[13:18] <St4ud3_> HASKELL FUCK YEAH
[13:18] <bildramer> I guarantee you can do it in Java or wxWidgets
[13:18] <bildramer> or AutoIt
[13:18] <Vis{IDK}> Java = bad for everything.
[13:18] <_`Memainman> AHK?
[13:18] <bildramer> tru dat
[13:18] <Vis{IDK}> I know AHK
[13:18] <bildramer> ahk?
[13:18] <_`Memainman> oh >.>
[13:18] <Vis{IDK}> That's what my autoclicker is in now
[13:18] <Vis{IDK}> :)
[13:18] <St4ud3_> Go a step further and learn K Keiya
[13:18] <bildramer> oooh
[13:18] <bildramer> learn AutoIt
[13:18] <Keiya> x86 asm!
[13:18] <bildramer> it's more powerful etc.
[13:18] <Vis{IDK}> I want it to have a window
[13:18] <Vis{IDK}> With logos
[13:19] <bildramer> hehehehehe fuck yeah
[13:19] <Vis{IDK}> and purple
[13:19] <bildramer> AutoIt is simple and easy
[13:19] <_`Memainman> ok. VB it is then
[13:19] <bildramer> and supports craploads of shit
[13:19] <Vis{IDK}> And a nice slider for click time
[13:19] <Jackomel> at least use VB.net
[13:19] <bildramer> this too
[13:19] <Vis{IDK}> On off hotkeys
[13:19] <St4ud3_> Or J would probbly be a bit easier :D
[13:19] <bildramer> AutoIt has all of those, Vis
[13:19] <Jackomel> plain old VB is really bad
[13:19] <sired22> frankly my favorite will always be assembly but its not practical now but seeing as you can even use asm in visual basic, c++ and others i still enjoy it
[13:19] <Jackomel> at least vb.net has classes
[13:19] <Keiya> Jackomel: That's what it'd be
[13:19] <Keiya> If he's using Express, it's VB.net
[13:19] <Vis{IDK}> Am
[13:20] <Jackomel> ok then
[13:20] <Keiya> AKA C# with words instead of symbols
[13:20] <Jackomel> exactly
[13:20] <Jackomel> converting from C# to vb.net is easy
[13:20] <Marafk> omg microsoft faggotry
[13:20] <Jackomel> or the other way around
[13:20] <bildramer> Ignore everything C#
[13:20] <_`Memainman> agreed
[13:20] <Vis{IDK}> So, VB?
[13:20] <Marafk> fuck no
[13:20] <bildramer> ^
[13:21] <Vis{IDK}> That seems like a language that's worth learning

[13:22] <Vis{IDK}> Batch, most markup and javascript, Gmod Wiremod's Expression 2 (that counts!) and a basic understanding of Java.
[13:22] <bildramer> then C
[13:22] <St4ud3_> I dont think anything besides Java really counts as experience. Python is worth learning, but C or C++ are always good to know
[13:23] <St4ud3_> If he wants simple then Python
[13:23] <Vis{IDK}> Powerful too!
[13:23] <Marafk> everytime i attempt to learn something else, i end up returning to c++
[13:23] <bildramer> well, python is pretty good
[13:23] <_`Memainman> ^this
[13:23] <bildramer> python or C++ ftw
[13:23] <Vis{IDK}> C++ then
[13:23] <Marafk> it just feels like home.
[13:23] <sired22> most languages are based on c and its ilk so a c or c++ would be best

[14:35] <Flot> Snow was added last update.
[14:35] <Slam> awes0m3
[14:35] <Flot> And he's planning swamps and deserts too.
[14:35] <Shrub> Swamps will be fucking awesome
[14:35] <Slam> thats how i type
[14:35] <Shrub> then I can recreate deliverance.
[14:35] <Euphoriant> hell yeah
[14:35] <Slam> we can recreate fucking tamriel
[14:35] <Euphoriant> can i be hobbled?
[14:37] <Euphoriant> minfinitely deep floating levels
[14:37] <Flot> Also, I'm thinking that the level generator will work a lot like the one in indev: Choose a biome from the start: Hell, Floating, Snowy, Desert, Swamp, Forest, Crazy (Old infdev map generator with lots of landmarks), indev (old indev generator possibly, with flatter land), and All, which includes all biomes which can be generated randomly as you go through
[14:37] <Flot> the map.
[14:37] <Euphoriant> damn that would look crazy
[14:38] <copyboy> oh man, i totally forgot to bring an octagon!

Mine a coal block, open up a scary dark passage that I immediately close up; *deep rumbling sound*. Wandering around in my cave aimlessly, *shweee...* so I look around and realize that I just entered the part of my cave that's exposed to the outdoors and it's the middle of the night.

[15:15] <tPRoC> What do you guys think of these ideas?
[15:17] <Roy> I think they're quite good
[15:19] <tPRoC> I think a temperature meter should be added.
[15:19] <tPRoC> Some biomes are hot, some are cold.
[15:19] <tPRoC> Cloth armour will keep your temperature at around 50% at most times, which means cloth will actually have a use.
[15:19] <Roy> Biomes...?
[15:19] <tPRoC> Armour made out of metal will actually make your temperature go up/down faster, depending on where you are.
[15:20] <tPRoC> Snowy areas/deserts/swamps/etc
[15:20] <Roy> Ah
[15:20] <tPRoC> Water will lower your temperature.
[15:20] <Helar> 9. quicksand doesnt appear in swamps.. it appeares in desert
[15:21] <tPRoC> actually quicksand does appear in swamps.
[15:21] <tPRoC> and jungles.
[15:21] <tPRoC> it's actually pretty rare in deserts.
[15:21] <Helar> estonia is full of swamps.. i know what i'm talking about
[15:21] <Helar> there is no sand in swamps
[15:21] <Helar> only deep deeeeeep mud

[15:31] <Helar> indeed
[15:31] <Helar> minecraft needs a radio
[15:31] <Flot> For those who don't know, there is a rumour that people dug a well into the earth and could hear the sounds of hell.
[15:31] <Flot> Keep listening.
[15:32] <Flot> I would like it if they made the bottom of the earth very dark so you couldn't hear it
[15:32] <Emphursis> they actually did dig down, but it was just a cave or something like that, I can't remember exactly
[15:32] <Flot> And the sounds sounded very loud once you dug down

[16:00] <Lupus> that the music will be specialer if its ingame only
[16:01] <Flot> I like listening to soundtracks individually too. Sometimes I don't want to play, but I want to listen to the music.
[16:01] <Lupus> youd have to be really crap with technology to not be able to crack a simple protection thingy
[16:01] <vurtual> quake 3 music isn't any less special even though I occasionally blast it.
[16:01] <Flot> You understand that, right?
[16:01] <Flot> I mean, you don't go and watch an entire movie just so you can hear a song in it.
[16:02] <Flot> And Lupus, it's not the cracking that I'm talking about at all. It's the idea that these files will be hidden away from users.

[16:04] <Flot> The way I see it, no one will know about the Minecraft soundtrack if they didn't buy the game; and if that's the case, no one will want to pirate it, because they don't know about it!

[16:32] <Shrub> and kills other pimps... with rocket launchers.
[16:32] <sorre> although
[16:32] <Shrub> then takes their hos and GIVES THEM FUCKING HEALTH BENEFITS FOR ONCE.
[16:32] <sorre> unlike mobsters, pimps actually do protect their merchandise

[16:32] <CyborgDragon> yeah, they do shrub
[16:32] <Shrub> but pimps don't have tommy guns.
[16:32] <Shrub> or italian accents.
[16:32] <Shrub> (alternatively, irish)
[16:33] <CyborgDragon> they protect em very well, but threaten them with not being able to work in the hooker business(or death if they're a bad pimp) if they don't work for him.

Because Jesus ate me and fucked me all night long without stopping,
[18:52] <CyborgDragon> it does, koko, but it stops at water, xD
[18:52] <Lutin> Yeah
[18:52] <Kokopure> because I stand under at tree and it stops snowing
[18:52] <Lutin> And it doesn't go through glass
[18:52] <shisno> Because he was a female prostitute who enjoyed not being payed because she had a penis which had herpes.

[18:56] <CyborgDragon> kodaichi, you just generate worlds until you get one
[18:56] <Beardbeard> it's like a 50/50 chance
[18:56] <Kodaichi> I've generated like 6 new worlds and none are snowy - oh okY
[18:56] <Kodaichi> alright
[18:56] <Lutin> I wish snow was a height based thing
[18:56] <Lutin> Like realllly tall mountains would form snow
[18:56] <sorre> there's not enough height for that to work well
[18:56] <CyborgDragon> lutin, shaddap, it probably will be eventually
[18:56] <Lutin> Yeah there is
[18:56] <sorre> no there isn't
[18:56] <CyborgDragon> and it most definitely will be in seasons
[18:56] <Kodaichi> awwight, got it
[18:57] <sorre> have you ever built from sea level to the top of a map?
[18:57] <Kodaichi> woot
[18:57] <sorre> it's not that big
[18:57] <ClassiestMedic> well then
[18:57] <Beardbeard> height only extends like 6-7 blocks above the clouds
[18:57] <Lutin> Well, yeah
[18:57] <ClassiestMedic> notch should make it higher
[18:57] <ClassiestMedic> shouldn't he
[18:57] <Beardbeard> no
[18:57] <Beardbeard> not higher
[18:57] <Beardbeard> nonono
[18:57] <Lutin> Change 0-127 to 0-255
[18:57] <Beardbeard> maps are giant enough in infinite
[18:57] <ClassiestMedic> I think snow should show up above clouds
[18:57] <ClassiestMedic> SOMETIMES
[18:57] <ClassiestMedic> and sometimes it doesn't
[18:57] <Lutin> Make it heigher and add a grapling rope
[18:58] <CyborgDragon> he should make it higher, but at the moment making it higher would break the sun's lighting algorithm
[18:58] <ClassiestMedic> noooo
[18:58] <Beardbeard> How would it show up above clouds
[18:58] <Beardbeard> snow falls from clouds
[18:58] <ClassiestMedic> hum
[18:58] <ClassiestMedic> touche
[18:58] <Beardbeard> do the clouds have hand cannons?
[18:58] <Beardbeard> that they fire snow out of

[18:58] <ClassiestMedic> think of this
[18:58] <ClassiestMedic> mount everest
[18:58] <Lutin> sorre, Yeah I was about to say
[18:58] <sorre> just because clouds are below, doesn't mean clouds can't also be above
[18:58] <ClassiestMedic> it's above ALL clouds
[18:58] <Kokopure> I have
[18:58] <ClassiestMedic> but it's SNOW ALL OVER
[18:58] <Kokopure> not mt everest, but yeah
[18:59] <Kodaichi> you have to play snow worlds with high fog on.
[18:59] <Beardbeard> It's not above all clouds
[18:59] <sorre> i've been to the rocky mountains
[18:59] <Kodaichi> YOU HAVE TO
[18:59] <Beardbeard> There are clouds above everest
[18:59] <sorre> nice place
[18:59] <ClassiestMedic> kodaichi= YES
[18:59] <CyborgDragon> mt. everest isnt above the clouds
[18:59] <Beardbeard> It's above some clouds
[18:59] <CyborgDragon> tallest mountain does not mean highest mountain
[18:59] <Beardbeard> not all
[18:59] <CyborgDragon> mt. everst's base is about 2 miles below sea level
[18:59] <sorre> now you're just being pedantic
[18:59] <sorre> none of this matters
[18:59] <Lutin> If you guys have ever looked at pictures of everest
[19:00] <Lutin> Everest itself forms clouds at it's peaks
[19:00] <Beardbeard> mountains form clouds you heard it here first
[19:00] <Beardbeard> Everest is just above the lowest clouds
[19:00] <CyborgDragon> actually beardbeard, they do
[19:00] <CyborgDragon> meteorology, aint it a bitch?
[19:01] <Beardbeard> everything I learned in grade school is a liiiiieeee
[19:01] <Lutin> Clouds are just tiny water droplets
[19:01] <muddtusk> BS
[19:01] <Lutin> formed around tiny particles
[19:01] <Lutin> Not BS
[19:01] <DimJim|schlepping> i read beardology
[19:01] <Beardbeard> The air temperature forms clouds
[19:01] <muddtusk> They are great ephemeral beasts which sleep on the ground in the mornings.
[19:01] <ClassiestMedic> Lutin is right
[19:02] <Beardbeard> if it is cold enough for vapor to condense

[19:06] <ClassiestMedic> i'm not madly religious
[19:06] <Beardbeard> because they are above our ideas of what is real
[19:06] <muddtusk> If clouds are just "masses of cold/frozen water vapor", how does snow develop without them?
[19:06] <sorre> MAGIC
[19:06] <ClassiestMedic> it BLOWS AROUND
[19:06] <muddtusk> Snow relies very much on cold/frozen water vapor
[19:06] <Shisno> Red vs blue for the win
[19:06] <Beardbeard> clouds are formed from the water vapor coming together
[19:06] <muddtusk> Yep
[19:06] <Beardbeard> it can fall on its own if the conditions are right
[19:06] <sana> epic win shisno XDD
[19:06] <Beardbeard> doesn't have to join into a huge mass
[19:07] <CyborgDragon> clouds are water vapor, not frozen water vapor
[19:07] <Lutin> Hi. If something exists in one place, it can't be in another. I am muddtusk.
[19:07] <Shisno> sana - was that at before?
[19:07] <Shisno> or, red vs blue?
[19:07] <Lutin> Water can't be in cups because it is in the ocean.
[19:07] <ClassiestMedic> the arctic is one of the driest places on earth. There's a shitload of snow, but it just blows around for months and years and decades
[19:07] <CyborgDragon> snow is frozen water vapor, it freezes as it falls, or in the case of snow above clouds, it just freezes on to the landform

[19:12] <CyborgDragon> lutin, the wood tools were me chopping wood
[19:12] <Beardbeard> Oh
[19:12] <sana> 3ds version will probably be outdated and more playable
[19:12] <sana> err
[19:12] <sana> updated
[19:12] <Shisno> sana - You play minecraft.
[19:12] <sana> where is my mind
[19:13] <CyborgDragon> not this again
[19:13] <Shisno> :|
[19:13] <sana> minecraft is retro
[19:13] <sana> and a new product
[19:13] <Shisno> ..ohi, zelda.
[19:13] <Beardbeard> I know what you mean, my n64/sega genesis games look so weird after playing stuffl ike super mario galaxy 2
[19:13] <sana> ^
[19:13] <sana> plus
[19:13] <sana> minecraft skewed my sense of graphics
[19:13] <Beardbeard> Paper Mario is probably the most well-aged n64 game for me, graphics wise
[19:13] <Snake> Beardbeard: But that's the beauty of them.
[19:13] <CyborgDragon> the 3DS version of ocarina of time is a port, with new controls, rounded polygon models, and the dev textures(the ocarina of time textures, before they had to be shrunk to fit on the N64 cartridge)
[19:13] <sorre> >N64 games
[19:13] <Shisno> lol. I give in, you?ve successffully trolled me.
[19:13] <sana> because I manage to find big randomly-generated cliffs impressive
[19:13] <ClassiestMedic> paper mario makes me want to headbang
[19:13] <sorre> >aging well
[19:13] <ClassiestMedic> it's mario
[19:13] <CyborgDragon> beardbeard, they're porting paper mario to the 3DS as well
[19:13] <ClassiestMedic> but looking a LITTLE bit different
[19:14] <Beardbeard> OH MY GOD REALLY
[19:14] <ClassiestMedic> and the fucking developers
[19:14] <ClassiestMedic> managed to pass it off
[19:14] <ClassiestMedic> as a completely new game
[19:14] <sana> fuck paper mario

[19:14] <sana> didnt try the other RPGs yet
[19:14] <Beardbeard> I like all the mario rpgs
[19:14] <sorre> you know what would be an interesting take on an old game?
[19:14] <sana> also holy shit cyborg dragon why would you have 20 wooden axes
[19:14] <Vic> mario and luigi 2 is the worst of all the three games

[19:15] <Beardbeard> I liked mario and luigi partners in time
[19:15] <sana> make golden hoe
[19:15] <Vic> uh. i worded it wrong
[19:15] <Beardbeard> :|
[19:15] <sana> pimp hoes
[19:15] <Vic> but you get my idea
[19:15] <sana> thats because its a good game beardbeard
[19:15] <Kokopure> CyborgDragon
[19:15] <CyborgDragon> partners in time is mario and luigi 2
[19:15] <Kokopure> where does your music come from?
[19:15] <Vic> it IS a good game
[19:15] <Beardbeard> I know
[19:15] <Vic> but it's the worst of the three
[19:15] <sana> ocarina of time ice dungeon Kokopure
[19:15] <Kokopure> ahh
[19:16] <Beardbeard> Don't call it the worst
[19:16] <CyborgDragon> Kokopure : zelda
[19:16] <Beardbeard> That sounds like it's bad
[19:16] <Vic> fiiiine
[19:16] <Vic> but it's way too serious for a m&l game
[19:16] <Kokopure> CyborgDragon
[19:16] <sana> my friend had all of his characters up to level 100
[19:16] <sana> what a fiendish nerd
[19:16] <Kokopure> that crater is naturally ocurring?
[19:16] <Beardbeard> I didn't find it too serious
[19:16] <CyborgDragon> the overworld, ice, theme, is ice dungeon, the theme when i go into the ice cave is "cave" from link to the past, and the battle theme is "battle" from MM
[19:16] <CyborgDragon> yes, koko, it is
[19:17] <Kokopure> but you went into it with torches and cobble beforehand
[19:17] <Vic> compared to the other two, it is
[19:17] <CyborgDragon> i made those beforehand
[19:17] <Vic> and... the kids
[19:17] <Beardbeard> I suppose so
[19:17] <CyborgDragon> other than the torches and coble path, it is naturally occuring
[19:17] <Beardbeard> Yeah getting used to doing things properly with the babies was kind of annoying
[19:17] <Beardbeard> But it made it so much easier once you did
[19:18] <Vic> i just... couldn't get into PiT for some reason
[19:18] <CyborgDragon> also, one last great game for the 3DS
[19:18] <Kokopure> holy shit CyborgDragon
[19:18] <CyborgDragon> they're making a new kid icarus game, and it's for the 3DS
[19:18] <Kokopure> where the hell are those mobs coming from
[19:18] <Kokopure> is that just what caves are like??
[19:18] <Beardbeard> That's the launch title, cy.
[19:18] <CyborgDragon> koko, they just kept spawning, repeatedly
[19:18] <sana> who gives a shit about all that
[19:18] <sana> the 3ds has amazing processing power
[19:18] <Beardbeard> what are you talking about koko/cyborg
[19:18] <sana> its gonna be great for homebrew

[19:40] <Beardbeard> redstone should be useable in explosives
[19:40] <Beardbeard> maybe instead of sand, you could use redstone in tnt?
[19:40] <CyborgDragon> uhhh
[19:40] <CyborgDragon> redstone makes excellent fuses
[19:40] <Shisno> sire - is it a good way?
[19:41] <SireTRM> Shisno, if you can get out of your own pit
[19:41] <Shisno> yeah i can
[19:41] <Beardbeard> shisno, try this
[19:41] <CyborgDragon> shisno, most use ladders, but stairs going round the edge are good too
[19:41] <Beardbeard> make a long hall, and then halls branching off to each side every 2 blocks
[19:41] <Shisno> i do the staircase around the edge
[19:41] <Shisno> not actual stairs
[19:41] <Beardbeard> go downwards a few levels if you need to
[19:41] <Beardbeard> It allows you to find all the ore in an area efficiently
[19:41] <Shisno> beard im not lookin for ore.
[19:42] <Beardbeard> oh
[19:42] <Shisno> i actually cut the stairs in the side of the cave

[20:05] <Beardbeard> you have to mine the spawner

[20:05] <ClassiestMedic> MINE IT

[20:22] <Helar> riverside muthafucka
[20:23] <Akai> what's MCsharp offer, anyways?
[20:23] <PandaBear> Beard, building if the point.
[20:23] <gdude2002|away> lol at #mcc topic
[20:23] <gdude2002|away> Modding MC# = Modding Myne, just don't do it!'
[20:23] <gdude2002|away> I agree
[20:23] <PandaBear> People are creating NEW build servers
[20:23] <PandaBear> the old ones e.g archives
[20:23] <PandaBear> are fine
[20:23] <PandaBear> just now theres too many
[20:23] <visiON> 8so liek
[20:23] <visiON> ahts up
[20:23] <gdude2002|away> Nah, he's getting mixed up
[20:23] <Helar> we need moard SMP servers
[20:23] <vurtual> GTA IV should've had a mode that played like SP
[20:23] <Helar> moar*
[20:23] <vurtual> so you could gain money
[20:23] <Beardbeard> MCSharp has only a few custom building commands, while having insane anti-grief protection
[20:23] <vurtual> and do the minigames
[20:23] <Helar> More*
[20:23] <gdude2002|away> the software isn't called The Archives
[20:23] <gdude2002|away> Bewardb
[20:23] <Beardbeard> This is why it is the only good custom server
[20:23] <visiON> wat is smpg out?
[20:23] <visiON> damn, man
[20:23] <Helar> yes
[20:23] <visiON> damn
[20:23] <gdude2002|away> Beardbeard, man
[20:23] <vurtual> smpg?
[20:23] <visiON> idno
[20:24] <gdude2002|away> you're comparing a whole branch of software with one server
[20:24] <visiON> ima go beg to drink
[20:24] <visiON> more wine
[20:24] <visiON> be back in 50

[20:24] <gdude2002|away> If you want to compare with Myne, it's pretty much the same :P
[20:24] <Helar> oh snap
[20:24] <Beardbeard> Myne is horrible
[20:24] <Beardbeard> Too many silly commands
[20:24] <gdude2002|away> Examples?
[20:24] <Beardbeard> Those uh portal things
[20:24] <PandaBear> Dude
[20:24] <PandaBear> have you not seen
[20:24] <gdude2002|away> those are epic
[20:24] <Beardbeard> and the blocks that make text show up
[20:24] <PandaBear> the MCSharp advanced physics
[20:24] <gdude2002|away> the messageblocks
[20:24] <PandaBear> they have 3 kinds of doors
[20:24] <Beardbeard> and all the damned building commands
[20:25] <PandaBear> ...
[20:25] <gdude2002|away> there's hardly any building commands
[20:25] <gdude2002|away> lol
[20:25] <gdude2002|away> just /build and /blb
[20:25] <Beardbeard> what's wrong with 3 kinds of doors?
[20:25] <PandaBear> Nothing
[20:25] <PandaBear> But if your saying
[20:25] <PandaBear> Myne is complicated..

[20:25] <gdude2002|away> :P
[20:25] <Beardbeard> What is the point of those message blocks and portals
[20:25] <CyborgDragon> 3 kinds? lol, my mcsharp has all door types, all obpblock types, and any block can be a portal as well
[20:25] <Beardbeard> When you can just type a command to enter another level
[20:26] <gdude2002|away> Message blocks are great for the tutorial world
[20:26] <gdude2002|away> and portals don't just change the map

[20:26] <Beardbeard> Add /help and make it show you the commands
[20:26] <gdude2002|away> Beardbeard: Yes, we try to help the new players, and not be elitist, like you.
[20:26] <Helar> mczall will become free in 7 days
[20:26] <Beardbeard> New players suck
[20:26] <PandaBear> The tutorial goes into detail
[20:26] <CyborgDragon> so?
[20:26] <PandaBear> and we're hardly going to add
[20:26] <PandaBear> ./help worlds
[20:27] <Beardbeard> New players can't build decent things
[20:27] <Beardbeard> why would I want them in my server
[20:27] <gdude2002|away> Not the point.
[20:27] <PandaBear> ./help blocks
[20:27] <PandaBear> etc
[20:27] <PandaBear> :P
[20:27] <gdude2002|away> If you don't get new players, then your server gets boring, old, and filled with the same type of stuff
[20:27] <Beardbeard> Not really, no.
[20:27] <gdude2002|away> mhm.
[20:27] <gdude2002|away> I've seen a prime example of it;.
[20:28] <Beardbeard> Why would it get old? There are plenty of people who have been playing since last year.
[20:28] <gdude2002|away> Yeah, I know
[20:28] <Beardbeard> that could show up on the server.
[20:28] <CAPSLOCKGUY> Multiplayer Survival is going to change a lot of stuff.
[20:28] <gdude2002|away> But they're new players to your server
[20:28] <gdude2002|away> :P

[20:28] <ClassiestMedic> which blocks
[20:29] <Beardbeard> They can go to a server full of bad builders then
[20:29] <Beardbeard> like
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> I know allll the blocks there are
[20:29] <Zep--> the rocks i dig
[20:29] <Beardbeard> WoM or the archives or chariot's

[20:29] <Zep--> yes
[20:29] <gdude2002|away> imo you're just too lazy to say: "Look dude, that's nice and all but you need to build more epic stuff"
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> coal is coal
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> or coal ore
[20:29] <Helar> i have been playing for 2 months and still build cubey houses
[20:29] <gdude2002|away> which is what we do
[20:29] <Zep--> but they have no names
[20:29] <gdude2002|away> and it works
[20:29] <gdude2002|away> :P
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> the brownish ore is iron ore
[20:29] <Beardbeard> Too lazy?
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> or iron
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> the goldish ore is gold ore
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> or gold
[20:29] <gdude2002|away> Mcsharp is multiworld now, isn't it?
[20:29] <Beardbeard> If they don't build something good they don't get builder rank.
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> the whitish ore is diamond ore
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> or diamond
[20:29] <Beardbeard> And I tell them to fuck off.
[20:29] <Beardbeard> It is.
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> the reddish ore is copper
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> or copper ore
[20:29] <gdude2002|away> Yeah, and what server had that first?
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> well
[20:29] <ClassiestMedic> we don't really have a name
[20:30] <ClassiestMedic> for the red ore
[20:30] <Tukiko> classiest: Redstone
[20:30] <Beardbeard> It's called redstone
[20:30] <Beardbeard> according to notch
[20:30] <gdude2002|away> Beardbeard: What server had that first? :P
[20:30] <Zep--> i have a picture of all the block names, just wondered if they are named in game somewhere
[20:30] <Beardbeard> Probably the archives.
[20:30] <gdude2002|away> mm, it was
[20:30] <gdude2002|away> Anywas.
[20:30] <gdude2002|away> Anyways*
[20:30] <Beardbeard> They go ridiculously overboard with it though.

[20:31] <gdude2002|away> You may want to stop being bitter, else mc# might not be included in the inter-server communications platform
[20:31] <Beardbeard> The majority of your "regulars" probably suck at building, or have some form of mental handicap.
[20:32] <gdude2002|away> Actually, they don't.
[20:32] <gdude2002|away> I can show you plenty of epic builds.
[20:32] <gdude2002|away> :P
[20:32] <Zep--> !help
[20:32] <Beardbeard> Why would my opinions matter on mc# inter-whatever?

[20:33] <ClassiestMedic> like pennies
[20:33] <Helar> hell no

[20:34] <CyborgDragon> classiestmedic, notch has SAID it isn't copper, it isn't cuprite, it is redstone, and it is magic, not flammable
[20:34] <ClassiestMedic> Idc
[20:34] <ClassiestMedic> I call it copepr
[20:34] <ClassiestMedic> copper
[20:34] <CyborgDragon> REDSTONE, not copper, minium, cuprite, etc, and it's magical, not fire or electricity
[20:34] <ClassiestMedic> idc
[20:34] <ClassiestMedic> copper
[20:34] <Beardbeard> It burns.
[20:34] <ClassiestMedic> I call it
[20:34] <gdude2002|away> oh, yeah
[20:34] <ClassiestMedic> copper
[20:34] <ClassiestMedic> FLAMMABLE COPPER THEM
[20:34] <CyborgDragon> Beardbeard, it isnt burning -.-
[20:34] <Tukiko> I don't care what anyone calls it as long as they don't try to get new people to name it something other than Redstone or whatever they want to name it.
[20:35] <gdude2002|away> Beardbeard: Pretty much all of those commands were requested by the userbase, fyi
[20:35] <gdude2002|away> I don't see the point in some of them either
[20:35] <Beardbeard> then you have terrible users.
[20:35] <ClassiestMedic> brb
[20:35] <Tukiko> Beardbeard: When does it burn?
[20:35] <gdude2002|away> Beardbeard: Bitter ftw.
[20:35] <Beardbeard> It acts as a fuse, tukiko.
[20:35] * Stick_ (Stick@cblmdm24-53-171-141.buckeyecom.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[20:35] <Beardbeard> It's either burning or conducting electricity or something.
[20:35] <Beardbeard> It can set off tnt.
[20:35] <CyborgDragon> beardbeard, magic
[20:35] <CyborgDragon> it's magic, the magic can set off tnt apparently
[20:35] <Beardbeard> Magic causes it to burn.
[20:35] <CyborgDragon> also, the gun powder is magic too
[20:35] * gdude2002|away is now known as gdude2002
[20:35] <Tukiko> Or a wire, Beardbeard, considering there are no sparks and it doesn't get used up by having energy flow through it like a fuse would.
[20:36] <Beardbeard> it is a conductor of some sort
[20:36] <Beardbeard> I wouldn't call it a wire persay
[20:36] <Beardbeard> since it's a dust
[20:36] * gdude2002 is now known as gdude2002|away
[20:36] * gdude2002|away is now away: Eating some fudz!
[20:36] <Tukiko> And nobody would call it a fuse.
[20:36] <CyborgDragon> it is a magically conductive wire, pretty much
[20:36] <ClassiestMedic> i call it wire :/
[20:36] <CyborgDragon> it's a conducter of magical current
[20:36] <Beardbeard> it acts as a fuse
[20:36] <ClassiestMedic> fuses burn
[20:36] <Tukiko> But it's not a fuse.
[20:36] <Beardbeard> A reusable fuse
[20:36] <Beardbeard> a magic fuse
[20:36] <Tukiko> That's called a wire
[20:36] * nNa (klemen_nna@91.185.218.229) has left #minecraft
[20:36] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[20:37] <Beardbeard> but it's not a wire.
[20:37] * Diablodoct0r (bdyddoc@193.71.126.90) has joined #minecraft
[20:37] <Tukiko> And it's not a fuse.
[20:37] <Beardbeard> It's dust.
[20:37] <Tukiko> Dust that conduct either electricity or magic.
[20:37] <Beardbeard> Yes
[20:37] <CyborgDragon> it conducts magic!
[20:37] <Tukiko> conducts*
[20:37] * ChJees2 is now known as ChJees
[20:37] <Tukiko> So it is neither a wire nor a fuse, it is dust that conducts energy.
[20:37] <Beardbeard> It conducts Notch's scent
[20:37] <CyborgDragon> notch has said it conducts a magical current, and that it is called redstone, and is not copper, cuprite, minium, or anything else real
[20:37] <Beardbeard> His scent causes things to activate
[20:38] <Tukiko> He said specifically it was magic?
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> idc
[20:38] <CyborgDragon> yes he has
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> I say it's copper
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> Yeah he did
[20:38] <Beardbeard> Magic in the minecraft world is Notch's scent.
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> But I'm still saying it's copper
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> I like to call it copper
[20:38] <CyborgDragon> copper is not pure red
[20:38] <Tukiko> Travelling along his favorite red thong
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> I like to call the dust copper dust
[20:38] <CyborgDragon> copper is "copper" in color, or tealgreen
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> and the wires wires
[20:38] <Tukiko> CyborgDragon: Lol I had someone trying to tell me copper is green.
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> idc
[20:38] <ClassiestMedic> I like copper
[20:39] <Beardbeard> did he argue that the statue of liberty is green, tukiko?
[20:39] <CyborgDragon> tukiko: copper oxide is tealgreen
[20:39] <Tukiko> Yes
[20:39] <Beardbeard> did you explain to him why it is green?
[20:39] <Tukiko> And yes, Cyborg, but we were talking about pure copper.
[20:39] <Tukiko> Yes I did and he didn't like it.
[20:39] <ClassiestMedic> the statue of liberty was copper colored once
[20:39] <ClassiestMedic> isn't that creepy?
[20:39] <Beardbeard> Punch him in the face for me.
[20:39] <ClassiestMedic> I like it greenish as it is now
[20:39] <Tukiko> No, it's science!
[20:39] <ClassiestMedic> lol, true
[20:39] <Beardbeard> It still is copper colored you twit.
[20:39] <ClassiestMedic> it's creepy science
[20:39] <ClassiestMedic> it's copper OXIDE colored
[20:40] <Beardbeard> It just has copper oxide coating it.
[20:40] <CyborgDragon> and if we took care of the lady like the romans took care of the colossus, she would still be copper in color
[20:40] <ClassiestMedic> oxidized copper
[20:40] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[20:40] <ClassiestMedic> She deserves it
[20:40] <Beardbeard> It's kind of hard to take care of a statue that big
[20:40] <Beardbeard> when it's in the middle of the fucking sea
[20:40] <CyborgDragon> the colossus was copper in color from the day it was erected to the day it was torn down
[20:40] <Beardbeard> speeding up the oxidization process.
[20:40] <CyborgDragon> so was the coloussus
[20:40] <ClassiestMedic> lol

[20:41] <SireTRM> Lazy people without slaves.
[20:41] <Tukiko> ^^^ This
[20:41] <SireTRM> Therefore, no cleaned statue.
[20:41] <Beardbeard> >implying that america now is the same way america was when the statue of liberty was erected
[20:42] <Beardbeard> The people back then were all working on more important things
[20:42] <Beardbeard> And now that it's oxidized so much there's really no way to fix it
[20:42] <Tukiko> And sticking children into large, deadly machines for pennies a week.
[20:42] <Beardbeard> Because they had to, tukiko.

[20:45] <ClassiestMedic> I've never even played roblox
[20:45] <ClassiestMedic> seen it
[20:45] <ClassiestMedic> hate it
[20:45] <Beardbeard> hurp du durr
[20:45] <ClassiestMedic> Do you see me saying

[20:45] <Tukiko> Sorry can't understand you.
[20:45] <ClassiestMedic> <Beardbeard> hurp du durr
[20:45] <ClassiestMedic> How old are you anyway
[20:45] <Tukiko> No I don't. :D
[20:45] <Beardbeard> Roblox has a terrible community. The same people that started turning roblox into a shithole are currently in minecraft.
[20:45] <Tukiko> Beardbeard: No that's 4chan.
[20:46] <Beardbeard> If something isn't done to remove these people(like classiestmedic here) minecraft will turn into the same thing.
[20:46] <CyborgDragon> beardbeard, you mean chesse20?
[20:46] <Beardbeard> 4chan is the reason minecraft has any popularity.
[20:46] * PandaBear is now known as Pandafk
[20:46] * Pandafk is now away: Dinner
[20:46] <Beardbeard> You should be thanking /v/.
[20:46] <ClassiestMedic> so, you're defending 4chan?
[20:46] <ClassiestMedic> The scourge of the internet?
[20:46] <Vic> 4chan is not bad
[20:46] <Beardbeard> The minecrafters from /v/ are decent people.
[20:46] <ClassiestMedic> Hah, and you call ME a shitter
[20:46] <Beardbeard> And they are the REASON this game is popular.
[20:46] <Tukiko> Beardbeard: And the reason it has trolls and horrible builders, as evident from Malikat's stream of 1,000-odd people one night when ti was posted on /v/.
[20:47] <Tukiko> it*
[20:47] <Beardbeard> If it weren't for them minecraft would have like 20 players.

[20:47] <ClassiestMedic> 4chan made Minecraft popular in ONE way: They brought the griefers
[20:47] <vurtual> Beardbeard
[20:47] <ClassiestMedic> And it was not a good way, either
[20:47] <Vic> ...what?
[20:47] <vurtual> ClassiestMedic has been around since the start
[20:47] <Beardbeard> horrible builders from /v/ stick to the /v/ servers.
[20:47] <ClassiestMedic> We might have 20 people
[20:47] <Tukiko> Well I'm not from /v/ and I found this just fine.
[20:47] <ClassiestMedic> but they would be GOOD people
[20:47] <vurtual> the griefers are not from 4chan either
[20:47] <Vic> guys
[20:47] <vurtual> they're from an entirely different amount of people
[20:47] <Vic> not everyone from 4chan is a troll
[20:47] * SerialDrifter (SerialDrif@ip192-98-173-82.adsl2.static.versatel.nl) has left #minecraft
[20:47] <Vic> have you EVER been on /v/?
[20:47] <gear> ^true facts
[20:47] <Vic> i don't think so
[20:47] <ClassiestMedic> seems that way, looking at beardy here
[20:48] <ClassiestMedic> Well, off to lunch
[20:48] <Beardbeard> v isn't half bad really
[20:48] <gear> the /v/tards are a great bunch of people usually
[20:48] <vurtual> Do I look like a troll to you?
[20:48] <Vic> it's got it's share of trolls
[20:48] <gear> i played wurm with them and it was great
[20:48] <Vic> but hell.
[20:48] <Tukiko> Vic: I find it easier to generalize people from 4chan as I've never seen a good one.
[20:48] <gear> BROHALLAAA
[20:48] <CyborgDragon> /v/ is great, except for the summer /v/tards
[20:48] <Beardbeard> The /v/ people that play this game are usually pretty nice.
[20:48] <Vic> again
[20:48] <Vic> it's like going out on the streets
[20:49] <Vic> and shouting "YOU'RE ALL HORRIBLE PEOPLE"
[20:49] <Vic> do you know them? no
[20:49] <Beardbeard> If you think /v/ is all trolls and retards then you might as well say all black people are robbers and rapists.
[20:49] <Vic> but you know that most people are horrible
[20:49] <Tukiko> Well at least I have a nice sample size of channers that I've met and hated.
[20:49] <Tukiko> Beardbeard: /v/ is not a race.
[20:49] <Beardbeard> It's a group of people.
[20:49] <Tukiko> Then it's completely different.
[20:49] <Vic> not really
[20:50] <Beardbeard> No it's not.
[20:50] <Beardbeard> You're generalizing a group.
[20:50] <Tukiko> So then /v/ is a race, got it.
[20:50] <Vic> <Beardbeard> You're generalizing a group.
[20:50] <Beardbeard> This is why the people you met didn't like you.
[20:50] * Mithril (Mithrildor@j31053.upc-j.chello.nl) Quit (Quit: Ik ga weg)
[20:50] <Beardbeard> And why you didn't like them
[20:50] <bildramer> I wish I shall become death, the destroyer of worlds
[20:50] <Tukiko> Beardbeard: I didn't have to say a thing to them for them to be complete assholes.
[20:50] <CyborgDragon> I have become death, destroyer of worlds.
[20:50] <bildramer> cannot killing idiots be made legal?
[20:51] * CyborgDragon has made the atomic bomb
[20:51] <bildramer> at least for a week?
[20:51] <bildramer> also, children's freedom
[20:51] <Vic> bil, we'd lose at least half of our population
[20:51] <bildramer> of course
[20:51] <Beardbeard> Either you said something to let them know that you're not intelligent
[20:51] <Vic> and that's because people don't care
[20:51] <bildramer> and nothing of value was lost
[20:51] <Beardbeard> Or you met a group that happened to be bad
[20:51] <bildramer> what
[20:52] <Beardbeard> You can't generalize a group based on the actions of some members.
[20:52] <bildramer> it's just my ignorant parents and family
[20:52] <bildramer> nonono
[20:52] <Beardbeard> Not you bil
[20:52] <Beardbeard> talking to tukiko
[20:52] <bildramer> oh
[20:52] <Tukiko> I would think the latter since I consider myself rather intelligent.
[20:52] <bildramer> /v/
[20:52] <bildramer> stop bashing 4chan
[20:52] <Beardbeard> And this is why you are not intelligent, tukiko.
[20:52] <bildramer> for the simple reason that there is a majority of people
[20:52] <bildramer> which will not let you win
[20:52] <Beardbeard> exactly, bil
[20:53] <Beardbeard> It's like calling all black people robbers/rapists
[20:53] <Tukiko> bildramer: I'm merely giving a reason for my generalization of the people from a website from a sample size.
[20:53] <Beardbeard> You shouldn't make generalizations in the first place.
[20:53] <bildramer> you may be right, but the other side is more persistent
[20:53] <Beardbeard> It just leads to problems.
[20:53] <Vic> generalising is good for animals
[20:53] <bildramer> idiots believe they're right etc.
[20:53] <Vic> and no, that wasn't a nigger joke
[20:53] <bildramer> ...lol
[20:54] <Beardbeard> I thought it was.
[20:54] <Beardbeard> Now I'm disappointed.
[20:54] <CyborgDragon> but vic, now that you said that, it is a nigger j oke
[20:54] <bildramer> he said the nigger-word!
[20:54] <Tukiko> Who said it was?
[20:54] <CyborgDragon> joke*
[20:54] <Vic> i'm sorry i wasn't strong enough
[20:54] <ClassiestMedic> baaack
[20:54] <ClassiestMedic> Lol wow
[20:54] <ClassiestMedic> huge mosh-argument
[20:54] <Lutin> Vic, that was a meta nigger joke
[20:54] <CyborgDragon> WALL OF TEXT FOR CLASSIESTMEDIC
[20:54] <Lutin> Joking about nigger jokes
[20:54] <bildramer> derp
[20:55] <Beardbeard> dude what
[20:55] <Beardbeard> that's like
[20:55] <ClassiestMedic> ?
[20:55] <Beardbeard> so meta
[20:55] <Vic> so meta
[20:55] <Vic> as meta as metagaming
[20:55] <ClassiestMedic> nigger jokes aint funny
[20:55] <Vic> unless they are
[20:55] <CyborgDragon> you cant meta nigger joke, it's impossible to meta when talking about nigger jokes
[20:55] <Vic> but i just did
[20:55] <ClassiestMedic> it's like, being racist
[20:55] <ClassiestMedic> and that's not cool
[20:55] <Lutin> What's the difference between a nigger and a snow tire?
[20:55] <Beardbeard> They're funny if you're not being serious.
[20:55] <ClassiestMedic> um
[20:55] <Beardbeard> That's the whole point of humor
[20:55] <ClassiestMedic> snow tires have holes in them?
[20:55] <Lutin> One doesn't sing when you put chains on it.
[20:55] <Beardbeard> the fact that it's not serious
[20:55] * NotchBot_ (NotchBot@109.76.91.183) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[20:55] <ClassiestMedic> still
[20:56] <ClassiestMedic> if I say
[20:56] <ClassiestMedic> some nigger joke
[20:56] <sorre> i don't think most people tell racist jokes out of actual racism
[20:56] * NotchBot (NotchBot@109.76.91.183) has joined #minecraft
[20:56] <Beardbeard> People get offended by non "racist" jokes
[20:56] <Beardbeard> it's the same thing really
[20:56] <ClassiestMedic> 1: nigger is a very offensive word
[20:56] <ClassiestMedic> 2: the people being joked about probably don't find it funny
[20:56] <Lutin> 1a: Only if you're white
[20:56] <Beardbeard> Which is why you don't joke about it in front of them
[20:56] <ClassiestMedic> not necessarily
[20:56] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[20:56] <sorre> right
[20:56] <Beardbeard> Have some decency
[20:56] <ClassiestMedic> in FRONT of them
[20:56] <NotchBot> Black people do find "nigger" offensive
[20:56] <Lutin> Exactly
[20:57] <Lutin> I automatically find that black people don't exist on the internet
[20:57] <ClassiestMedic> At this school, someone insulted a black kid and called hima nigger
[20:57] <ClassiestMedic> then he punched the kid's face in
[20:57] <geraldbrent> yay notchbot
[20:57] <Lutin> So nigger jokes on the internet is fine
[20:57] <Beardbeard> Just have the decency to not tell offensive jokes in front of people who would be offended
[20:57] <ClassiestMedic> for insulting him
[20:57] <ClassiestMedic> ofc if he had called him a nigger behind his back
[20:57] <ClassiestMedic> nobody would be offended
[20:57] <Beardbeard> exactly
[20:57] <ClassiestMedic> except the occasional race fanatic
[20:57] <NotchBot> That depends.
[20:57] <Tukiko> I find it pretty funny that people still haven't gotten past the whole thing of offensive words. They are just combinations of letters. It's like saying "efwgqwg" is offensive becuase you wanted to attach some arbitrary hatred to it.
[20:58] <geraldbrent> yea
[20:58] <Tukiko> because*
[20:58] <Vic> guys
[20:58] <Vic> guys
[20:58] <ClassiestMedic> well, it goes beyond that
[20:58] <Vic> we started with a 4chan hate discussion
[20:58] <Tukiko> I mean, they're just words. =/
[20:58] <ClassiestMedic> because this is a LANGUAGE
[20:58] <Beardbeard> It's not the word that should be thought of as offensive
[20:58] <Beardbeard> It's the tone
[20:58] <ClassiestMedic> they're not just words once you attatch meaning to them
[20:58] <ClassiestMedic> they're a language with meaning and the power to hurt people
[20:58] <Tukiko> Tone of voice or tone of discuss/sentence?
[20:58] <Beardbeard> Both, really
[20:58] <Tukiko> Wow, failtyping today. discussion*
[20:58] <sorre> remember, internet: serious business
[20:58] <Vic> both
[20:59] <Armonte> ..
[20:59] <Armonte> GUYS
[20:59] <sorre> never be offended by anything said on the internet, it's most likely just bullshit
[20:59] <Armonte> FREE SONG IN EVERY GOGURT BOX
[20:59] <Armonte> EVERYONE GETS ONE
[20:59] <Tukiko> Well seeing as we're typing then it can't be the former.
[20:59] <ClassiestMedic> aw shuddup you advertiser
[20:59] <ClassiestMedic> I see ads all over
[20:59] <Tukiko> They still make Gogurt?
[20:59] <ClassiestMedic> I DO NOT NEED THEM IN MY IRC
[20:59] <ClassiestMedic> >:U
[20:59] <Beardbeard> There's ads at the top of the irc page
[20:59] <Beardbeard> From esper itself
[20:59] <Tukiko> Those are so nasty. It's like eating fruity pudding in a tube.
[20:59] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[20:59] <ClassiestMedic> but that's in the webpage
[21:00] <Beardbeard> gogurt used to be good
[21:00] <ClassiestMedic> and I'm using mIRC

[21:00] <Tukiko> I never said when they came out. I said when they were good.
[21:01] <Tukiko> They could come out today and they'd still taste like crap.
[21:01] <SireTRM> Eug. I've had one of those in my life. Nasty things, Tukiko
[21:01] <NotchBot> On the sbject of curses, why do so many girls/women find the word "cunt" so offensive?
[21:01] <CyborgDragon> tukiko: it's called developed sense of taste, childrens' taste buds are no where near as developed as a teen's or adult's
[21:01] <geraldbrent> lol
[21:01] <Tukiko> I guess that's true.
[21:01] <Beardbeard> Because they're generally being called cunts, notch.
[21:02] <SireTRM> Wait, wtf
[21:02] <Tukiko> But we're really gross as kids. =/
[21:02] <CyborgDragon> notchbot isnt notch
[21:02] <CyborgDragon> notchbot is gdude
[21:02] <NotchBot> No, but "cunt" is a slang term for vagina
[21:02] <Beardbeard> Yes
[21:02] <NotchBot> And yes, I'm gdude, not Notch
[21:02] <ClassiestMedic> lol, this discussion started as a /v/ argument. now children's tastebuds? how the fuck did we get there?
[21:02] <Beardbeard> Like, here's an example
[21:02] <Lutin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZCS5I80X-8 <- That's a good one about what you were talking about, Tukiko
[21:02] <geraldbrent> OMG
[21:02] <Beardbeard> you say dick to talk about, well, a dick
[21:02] <Beardbeard> a guy won't be offended by it
[21:02] <CyborgDragon> http://hackedirl.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/129199047595759991.jpg
[21:02] <Beardbeard> you say dick to call a guy a dick
[21:02] <Beardbeard> he's offended
[21:03] <Shisno> no not really, beard.
[21:03] <Tukiko> Lutin: Watching them
[21:03] <Shisno> I like being called a dick
[21:03] <NotchBot> Yeah, but even just mentioning the word has some adverse effects on females
[21:03] <Beardbeard> Cunt is normally used to call a person a cunt
[21:03] <Beardbeard> that's why
[21:03] <Beardbeard> it's just its general use
[21:03] <Iguana> In the end, cussing is bad
[21:03] <SireTRM> Derogatory connotation in any and all uses.
[21:03] <Iguana> Let's leave it at that

[21:04] <CyborgDragon> i think the idea of certain words being bad to say around or to other adults is just stupid
[21:04] <Iguana> He goes on the Archives a bunch
[21:04] <Iguana> He was on a few days ago
[21:04] <Iguana> And nobody was on
[21:04] <gdude2002> hm
[21:04] <Iguana> So he went on another server
[21:04] <Beardbeard> It's because certain groups are offended, cyborg
[21:04] <gdude2002> bad timing probably
[21:04] <CyborgDragon> and?
[21:04] <Iguana> He never stays on the server if nobody is on
[21:04] <Iguana> He gets lonely easily :/
[21:04] <CyborgDragon> they shouldnt take any offesne to it
[21:04] <CyborgDragon> offense*
[21:05] <Beardbeard> You should consider who you're talking to when choosing what words to say
[21:05] <CyborgDragon> unless its used as an insult, they shouldnt take offense
[21:05] <CyborgDragon> yet so many people do, and it's just retarded
[21:06] <Beardbeard> cursing is rather crude. you should really only be using it when talking to friends.
[21:06] <Beardbeard> Or when you intend to offend a person.
[21:06] <CyborgDragon> my point is, cursing shouldn't be considered bad unless you're using to offend a person
[21:06] <Beardbeard> It should.
[21:06] <Togwells> New topic: Boats ahoy.
[21:06] <Beardbeard> If someone doesn't know you as a friend or something
[21:06] <Tukiko> I hate when people start insulting you when they're losing an argument.
[21:06] <Beardbeard> talking in a crude manner isn't good
[21:06] <Togwells> BOATS. AHOY.
[21:07] <CyborgDragon> beardbeard, there are cruder manners than cursing
[21:07] <Beardbeard> This is true.
[21:07] <Togwells> No boat chat.
[21:07] <Beardbeard> You don't use those manners either, though, do you?
[21:07] <CyborgDragon> because of how crude they are
[21:07] <Beardbeard> Exactly.
[21:07] <Tukiko> I believe Shakespeare had it right. "Do you bite your thumb at me?" "No, but I do bite my thumb."
[21:08] <CyborgDragon> my point is, almost everybody uses curse words now, yet if you say it to them, they flip the fuck out, even if you're not insulting them
[21:08] <Beardbeard> It's because you're not expected to use cursing casually unless talking to someone you know well
[21:08] <Beardbeard> because it is crude and doesn't give most people a good impression of you
[21:08] <CyborgDragon> or talking on the internet
[21:08] <Beardbeard> well yes
[21:08] <Tukiko> I find it hard that anyone would expect someone to curse.
[21:08] <Tukiko> hard to believe*

[21:16] <ClassiestMedic> they have that rocket car thing
[21:16] <CyborgDragon> its supposed to be the FBI -.-
[21:16] <ClassiestMedic> that uses an xbox 360 controller to drive
[21:16] <ClassiestMedic> fuck I want one of those
[21:16] <Beardbeard> Medic just stop

[21:17] <Beardbeard> The xbox controller is horrible.
[21:17] <ClassiestMedic> lol, manicdigger has snow now?
[21:17] <Beardbeard> No I don't.

[21:17] <Tukiko> WTF?
[21:17] <Tukiko> shitty*
[21:17] <exe> im not playing, im making
[21:17] <exe> also ban me
[21:18] <CyborgDragon> you know what's funny, i have a friend who was arrested by the FBI
[21:18] <ClassiestMedic> really?
[21:18] <Tukiko> exe: Well you're horrible at making. :P
[21:18] <CyborgDragon> really
[21:18] <Beardbeard> Manic Digger?
[21:18] <ClassiestMedic> what, was he smuggling hash or something
[21:18] <Beardbeard> do you get autobanned for saying minecraft on the forums?
[21:18] <ClassiestMedic> it's an MPS clone
[21:18] <CyborgDragon> he fucked around with them, they couldnt find what they wanted on his harddrive because he was smart and gutmann-passed the thing
[21:18] * quasi (Mibbit@ppp-48-188.grapevine.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[21:18] <Tukiko> Probably just decompiled and reused the code with crappy textures.
[21:18] <ClassiestMedic> why were they looking in his computer in the first place
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> not quite tukiko
[21:19] <CyborgDragon> tukiko, exe makes manic digger, and he made it from scratch
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> I've seen the code
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> it's completely different
[21:19] <CyborgDragon> notch approves of manic digger apparently, except for one thing
[21:19] <Tukiko> I never said definitely, I said probably. >_>
[21:19] <Beardbeard> The code is different, but it's still an MC clone.
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> what's that
[21:19] <quasi> what do you guys think of this http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1278781579188.png
[21:19] <vurtual> ...
[21:19] <vurtual> is it safe?
[21:19] <CyborgDragon> exe, notch has said he doesnt like manic digger being an alternative to connecting to minecraft creative servers
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> I never open 4chan images
[21:19] <Beardbeard> It's from /v/ of course it's safe
[21:19] <quasi> "Can be crafted from 3 wool and 6 wood. Using causes 12 minecraft hours to pass. Has limited uses, before a new bed must be constructed. May only be used under shelter in a lit area."
[21:19] <Tukiko> quasi: Would be put to better use as a boat or wind turbine sail.
[21:19] <quasi> its sfw yes
[21:19] <ClassiestMedic> it's safe
[21:20] <exe> CyborgDragon: that should require minecraft premium account
[21:20] <ClassiestMedic> hmm
[21:20] <Beardbeard> If a link is from /v/ it should be safe
[21:20] <ClassiestMedic> not a bad idea
[21:20] <ClassiestMedic> I don't trust /v/
[21:20] <Beardbeard> porn is not normally posted there because it's bannable.
[21:20] <sana> good one beardbeard
[21:20] <sana> 4chanites not posting porn
[21:20] <CyborgDragon> the only porn that's not bannable on /v/ is non videogame porn
[21:20] <sana> havent heard that one yet
[21:20] <Beardbeard> No
[21:21] <Beardbeard> /v/ is a "worksafe" board
[21:21] <Beardbeard> like all blue background boards
[21:21] <quasi> well you just heard 3 people confirm it's safe so..
[21:21] <ClassiestMedic> as the first two rules of the internet dictate
[21:21] <ClassiestMedic> do NOT talk about /b/
[21:21] <Beardbeard> Medic no
[21:21] <sana> ClassiestMedic get the fuck out
[21:21] <CyborgDragon> and also, beardbeard, the porn has to be spoiler'd
[21:21] <Beardbeard> you're acting like you're 12 again
[21:21] <Beardbeard> just stop it
[21:21] <sana> this is why I keep trash talking about minecraft's community.
[21:21] <ClassiestMedic> nope
[21:21] <Beardbeard> I'm pretty sure that only applies to vidya related porn cyborg
[21:21] <Beardbeard> any other types are bannable

[21:22] <CyborgDragon> that's what i said beardbeard
[21:22] <Beardbeard> oh
[21:22] <CyborgDragon> CyborgDragon> the only porn that's not bannable on /v/ is non videogame porn
[21:22] <Beardbeard> I didn't see
[21:22] <Beardbeard> you should remove the not from that
[21:22] <quasi> but yeah, don't you guys think a bed would be a good idea? It would mean you don't have to choose between mining at night, or going afk for 10 minutes while you wait for dawn
[21:22] <CyborgDragon> i know, double negative oopsie
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> I agree
[21:22] <quasi> you could even set the bed as your spawn point
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> beds are needed
[21:22] <Beardbeard> Medic, you're not a good troll.
[21:22] <CyborgDragon> beds wouldnt work in SMP
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> they'd replenish your health somewhat
[21:22] <ClassiestMedic> I'm not trying to be a troll
[21:22] <Beardbeard> If you admit to trolling you're not doing it properly.

[21:23] <vurtual> We should have regenerative pods
[21:23] <Beardbeard> You're attempting to antagonize
[21:23] <quasi> so just leave them out of multiplayer
[21:23] <Beardbeard> that is trolling
[21:23] <ClassiestMedic> I'm just lol'ing at your confrontationalism
[21:23] <vurtual> you stand in them, and they restore all your health and stuff
[21:23] <Tukiko> ClassiestMedic: Farming does that better without using up extra crafting plans.
[21:23] <Beardbeard> that is the very definition of trolling
[21:23] <quasi> or maybe, every player has to use the bed at once for it to work in multiplayer
[21:23] <ClassiestMedic> farming takes time though
[21:23] <CyborgDragon> the best troll is one who is successful, then admits it after everything dies down
[21:23] <ClassiestMedic> you have to make the dirt, till it, plant seeds, ets
[21:23] <Beardbeard> Beds could be useful for passing time.
[21:23] <Beardbeard> No the best trolls never admit it.
[21:23] <Beardbeard> To leave everyone wondering
[21:23] <ClassiestMedic> I already explained this
[21:23] <ClassiestMedic> I'm not trying to be a troll
[21:23] <ClassiestMedic> I'm just lol'ing at your confrontationalism
[21:24] <ClassiestMedic> brb
[21:24] <Beardbeard> You are attempting to antagonize(and failing horribly I might add). Antagonizing is trolling.
[21:24] <CyborgDragon> anyways, beds wouldnt work in SMP, at least, the passing time part wouldnt
[21:24] <Tukiko> ClassiestMedic: But it doesn't use up a crafting plan. Notch needs to make things able to use the same crafting plan by having a selection box or something appear when you make it. So that could be a bed or a sail that you choose by clicking.
[21:24] <Tukiko> Notch
[21:24] <Tukiko> ...
[21:24] <sana> [19:22:08] <ClassiestMedic> You do realize that everything I've said that's immature is to antagonize you
[21:24] <sana> thats the most stupid thing ive ever read
[21:24] <Beardbeard> There should be like

[21:25] <Tukiko> UGH
[21:25] <Beardbeard> So you never forget it
[21:25] <CyborgDragon> the recipe book must be crafted, too
[21:25] <RsquaredDsquared> hi guys where r fish and how can i mine them
[21:25] <sana> beardbeard but there's a wiki!
[21:25] <Beardbeard> You have to crat something for it to appear in there though

[21:25] <sana> there......
[21:25] <sana> is no fullscreen mode
[21:25] <CyborgDragon> RsquaredDsquared there are no fish, yet
[21:25] <RsquaredDsquared> oh ok
[21:25] <Tukiko> Yes there is.
[21:25] <Ominus> lies
[21:25] <sana> you press alt tab and land in firefox
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> back
[21:26] <RsquaredDsquared> there is?
[21:26] <Tukiko> Hit F11
[21:26] <sana> no?
[21:26] <Ominus> F11
[21:26] <Beardbeard> An in game function would still be better.
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> with beds
[21:26] <sana> oh.
[21:26] <sana> rright
[21:26] <Ominus> ruawr!
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> well
[21:26] <CyborgDragon> wut, f11?
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> hm
[21:26] <Tukiko> I agree with Beardbeard.
[21:26] <sana> gotta check that out
[21:26] <CyborgDragon> seriously?
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> beds in SMP
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> could be a problem
[21:26] <CyborgDragon> f11 is fullscreen, not fish
[21:26] <Beardbeard> Just a little thing that records recipes that you find.
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> i mean
[21:26] <RsquaredDsquared> oh...
[21:26] <CyborgDragon> classiest, i've said that five times now!
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> the game is operating in realtime for other people
[21:26] <RsquaredDsquared> i want fishies :( like pets
[21:26] <CyborgDragon> beds+SMP owont work
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[21:26] <ClassiestMedic> it won't
[21:26] <Beardbeard> It would be nice for passing time
[21:26] <Beardbeard> maybe like 8 hours
[21:26] <sana> you're right
[21:26] <RsquaredDsquared> smp isnt that a guy from youtube?
[21:26] <Beardbeard> to get past the night
[21:27] <sana> though it's uh
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> maybe they could be used just for afk people
[21:27] <sana> pretty much the same thing as maximizing the window
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> or healing up slightly
[21:27] <RsquaredDsquared> mr safety
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> smp = survival multiplayer
[21:27] <RsquaredDsquared> oh.
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> maybe when you're asleep
[21:27] <Tukiko> Beds are useless anyway. =/ That pattern could be better used as a sail for a wind turbine or boat as I've previously mentioned. If you want a bed then have a 3x3 area of wool and make it a sleeping bag.
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> disjointed images of the things you did a day ago
[21:27] <RsquaredDsquared> survival has multiplayer now?
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> float across the screen
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> it will
[21:27] <RsquaredDsquared> oh ok
[21:27] <quasi> hows this then, beds make time go faster, and slowly regenerate hearts. In multiplayer, they only function as health regen
[21:27] <Beardbeard> A sail wouldn't look like that
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> quasi
[21:27] <Beardbeard> more like
[21:27] <ClassiestMedic> that wouldnt work for smp
[21:27] <sana> infinite source of healing
[21:28] <Beardbeard> wood cloth air
[21:28] <Tukiko> quasi: SMP
[21:28] <Beardbeard> wood cloth cloth
[21:28] <DDRJake> I was hoping for beds...
[21:28] <Beardbeard> wood cloth cloth

[21:28] <ClassiestMedic> they'd swim around and stuff
[21:28] <sana> go ahead and do it then
[21:28] <Beardbeard> We don't need more pointless entities
[21:28] <ClassiestMedic> and you could damage them
[21:28] <quasi> well in single player, we need a way to pass time
[21:28] <Beardbeard> More entities means more lag
[21:28] <ClassiestMedic> Notch has mentioned fish
[21:29] <ClassiestMedic> sorry, he's mentioned ADDING fish
[21:29] <sana> hardly, beardbeard
[21:29] <Beardbeard> At least make them have a point
[21:29] <Tukiko> quasi: Minecraft -> Mine to pass the time
[21:29] <ClassiestMedic> they do
[21:29] <ClassiestMedic> they're like sea pigs
[21:29] <Koko|MW2> he's also mentioned coral
[21:29] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[21:29] <sana> minecraft doesnt even remotely have enough entities for good game depth yet
[21:29] <Koko|MW2> do you think coral will grow in snow maps?
[21:29] <Beardbeard> sea pigs
[21:29] <sana> adding more wont lag shit
[21:29] <CyborgDragon> breaking news: i just found out my bro's gf is possibly pregnant, did not need to know that they were doing the nasty
[21:29] <Beardbeard> just use
[21:29] <ClassiestMedic> I agree with sana
[21:29] <Beardbeard> normal pigs
[21:29] <Koko|MW2> CyborgDragon
[21:29] <Koko|MW2> it's possible that they weren't :D
[21:29] <Lutin> You know what I want? Furnaces that will run off lava
[21:29] <Koko|MW2> she mighta gotten preggers from a third party.
[21:29] * Shinki (Diablo@dhcp10-185.geusnet.com) has joined #minecraft
[21:29] <Beardbeard> Same lutin
[21:29] <Beardbeard> like in dwarf fortress
[21:29] <Lutin> Cause I have all this lava
[21:30] <Tukiko> Can we please not talk about coral? It serves no obvious purpose in gameplay as of now and would merely be cosmetic.
[21:30] <sana> yes that is gud idea
[21:30] <Lutin> But I can't forge shit with it
[21:30] * laCour|Offline is now known as laCour
[21:30] <CyborgDragon> ahem, sana, have you seen the entity count lately in alpha?
[21:30] <Beardbeard> Would make it so much nicer since I wouldn't have to refill it constantly
[21:30] <CyborgDragon> every flowing water and lava block counts as an entity
[21:30] <quasi> what if you want to build something out in the open? or on a floating island? you can only do so during the day
[21:30] <sana> what are thee talking about
[21:30] <CyborgDragon> so do signs, doors, and mob spawners(cages)
[21:30] <sana> yes
[21:30] <sana> i'm still running it at 300 fps
[21:30] <sana> with a mediocre pc
[21:30] <Beardbeard> You have a good computer then
[21:30] <CyborgDragon> the entity count averages over 1200 for me
[21:30] <Beardbeard> not all of us do
[21:30] <ClassiestMedic> *ahem*
[21:30] <sana> are you seriously suggesting there should not be any entities
[21:30] <ClassiestMedic> Me
[21:30] <Beardbeard> No
[21:30] <ClassiestMedic> I like entities
[21:30] <sana> minecraft doesnt lag if you add a bunch of bushes
[21:31] <SireTRM> CyborgDragon, I think that's the blocks loaded count.
[21:31] <Beardbeard> we're suggesting that they shouldn't be pointless ones
[21:31] <sana> neither will it if nocth adds a bunch of corals
[21:31] <sana> to underwater
[21:31] <CyborgDragon> and it the fps averages at 120 once all the chunks are done loading
[21:31] <SireTRM> C: N/X is the block count.
[21:31] <ClassiestMedic> I think we should have a few more types of entities
[21:31] <sana> water is a useless domain right now
[21:31] <Beardbeard> The game has to calculate entities that move
[21:31] <ClassiestMedic> fish for one
[21:31] <CyborgDragon> siretrm, -.-
[21:31] <sana> if it ever becomes passable, it should be more interesting
[21:31] <quasi> [spoiler] i get 60fps fullscreen, max vision on my mac laptop [/spoiler]
[21:31] <sana> e.g. underwater deco
[21:31] <sana> e.g. corals
[21:31] <CyborgDragon> doors, signs, mob spawners, and water/lava that is flowing ARE entities
[21:31] <sana> so what the hell about it
[21:31] <Beardbeard> I get 50 fps with render distance on tiny and graphics set to fast.
[21:31] <CyborgDragon> there's so many most people cant do shit, sana
[21:31] <Tukiko> sana: I would rather wait for Notch to finish the gameplay of the game before he does cosmetics. Besides it gives him time to further optimize his code before adding cosmetics.
[21:31] <sana> entities are necessary to progress the game.
[21:32] <sana> you can only have that much fun bashing at rock forever
[21:32] <ClassiestMedic> I get 50 with graphics on fancy and render on normal
[21:32] <ClassiestMedic> so I'm fine
[21:32] <sana> and building houses out of the same old materials
[21:32] <Beardbeard> fish are pointless entities
[21:32] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[21:32] <Beardbeard> He should add sea monsters though
[21:32] <ClassiestMedic> Like swimming creepers?
[21:32] <sana> fish are as pointless as torch particles are pointless
[21:32] <Beardbeard> No
[21:32] <CyborgDragon> i know sana, but im saying he should decrease the amount of entities, put tileentities into a separate thread from tiles and entities
[21:32] <ClassiestMedic> I agree
[21:32] <Beardbeard> giant monsters
[21:32] * Adam01 (Adam@cpc1-basl5-0-0-cust446.basl.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[21:32] <Beardbeard> in the sea
[21:32] <ClassiestMedic> Giant monsters?
[21:32] <Beardbeard> like
[21:32] <sana> you're both talking about different things aaaaaaaaaaaaa
[21:32] <Tukiko> He could just let you use a fishing rod in any water connected to an ocean or large lake and fish without any added entities.
[21:32] <Beardbeard> 5 blocks high, 10 blocks long
[21:32] <sana> one is talking crap the other isnt
[21:32] <ClassiestMedic> like evil whales?>
[21:32] <Beardbeard> or more
[21:33] <ClassiestMedic> I'd like swimming creepers
[21:33] <sana> tukiko's idea is good
[21:33] <sana> albeit world of warcraft-y
[21:33] <Beardbeard> giant loch ness monster type things
[21:33] <Beardbeard> maybe they could drop tools or materials
[21:33] <ClassiestMedic> Hm
[21:33] <Tukiko> sana: WoW still has fishing spots, just that you can fish anywhere and get utter crap.
[21:33] <Beardbeard> maybe gold
[21:33] <ClassiestMedic> Maybe
[21:33] <ClassiestMedic> Not gold
[21:33] <CyborgDragon> personally i want notch to optimize before addingb more entities
[21:33] <ClassiestMedic> Pork, maybe wool
[21:33] <Beardbeard> oh yeah
[21:33] <ClassiestMedic> from animals they've eaten
[21:33] <ClassiestMedic> and creeper items
[21:33] <Beardbeard> meat, maybe bones
[21:33] <sana> complaints about performance are silly
[21:33] <ClassiestMedic> yeah
[21:33] <Beardbeard> plus a tool or too
[21:33] <Beardbeard> *two
[21:33] <sana> just because minecraft is simplistic it doesnt mean its supposed to run on a 386
[21:34] <sana> it consumes a fuckton of resources
[21:34] <sana> its no old game
[21:34] <Beardbeard> Perhaps food dropped by monsters could give more hp
[21:34] <sana> get outraged over 2 new entities being added is silly
[21:34] <ClassiestMedic> maybe, if one eats a player, it drops more pork than normal and also drops the player's resources when it's killed
[21:34] <sana> getting*
[21:34] <Beardbeard> oh that's good
[21:34] <CyborgDragon> sana, we know, but it also uonoptimized, so people want him to optimize it
[21:34] <CyborgDragon> unoptimized*
[21:34] <Beardbeard> maybe when he adds dragons those could drop gold
[21:34] <ClassiestMedic> that'd be awesome
[21:34] <sana> but he does
[21:34] <ClassiestMedic> like, killing a sea monster
[21:34] <sana> optimize it
[21:34] <Beardbeard> since dragons are known for having hoards of treasure
[21:34] <sana> remember the update when he reverted saves back to previous state
[21:34] <ClassiestMedic> and it drops some tools, beef, wool, and some coal or torches
[21:34] <CyborgDragon> also, it uses java, which in and of itself is highly unoptimized bullshit
[21:35] <sana> boosted performance tremendously for me
[21:35] <ClassiestMedic> from a person it ate
[21:35] <sana> he does it from time to time, its just not particularly fun so he prefers doing friday updates
[21:35] <Beardbeard> Dragons could drop like
[21:35] <sana> to working on mp/optimization
[21:35] <quasi> Is notch eventually going to put magic in minecraft?
[21:35] <Beardbeard> iron tools, maybe diamonds on rare drops
[21:35] <ClassiestMedic> Yeah
[21:35] <Beardbeard> plus gold blocks/bars
[21:35] <Beardbeard> and meat
[21:35] <CyborgDragon> quasi, yeah, but we already have a form of magic :3
[21:35] <ClassiestMedic> They'd also drop lava, maybe
[21:35] <CyborgDragon> redstone is magic
[21:35] <ClassiestMedic> or when they die they set the ground on fire
[21:35] <ClassiestMedic> yeah! they drop red dust
[21:35] <sana> if anything, those sea monsters should guard underground treasuries
[21:35] <sana> with chests containing that stuff

[21:36] <Beardbeard> Maybe it could let you set things on fire, like what flint/iron already does
[21:36] <ClassiestMedic> hmm
[21:37] <CyborgDragon> beardbeard, i have suggested that a thousand times
[21:37] <ClassiestMedic> That'd be a little too normal
[21:37] <quasi> did notch end up naming it aspergite?

[21:37] <visiON> trololoolo
[21:37] <ClassiestMedic> one, i'm in the caribbean where it's hot as fuck normally
[21:38] <sana> that is because your laptop does not have the space for a bigass fan
[21:38] <ClassiestMedic> and two, I'm sitting on a rug and not letting it ventilate
[21:38] <CyborgDragon> my CPU is hovering at a cool 34 degrees fahrenheit
[21:38] <ClassiestMedic> wow
[21:38] <Beardbeard> Mine is at around 60-70

[21:40] <Beardbeard> holy shit
[21:40] <Lutin> sana, it will
[21:40] <sana> or area-dependant climate zones
[21:40] <CyborgDragon> sana, it will
[21:40] <ClassiestMedic> If you do a half twist midair or something you get extra points

[22:01] <Diablodoct0r> Let me teach you kiddies
[22:01] <ClassiestMedic> in my USA computer it'd be a shitton faster
[22:01] <Vic> we're showing 1mbits
[22:01] <Beardbeard> Your jitter is the same as mine
[22:01] <Beardbeard> but you have 5 times my ping
[22:01] <Diablodoct0r> How many MB's you have in Speed, does not matter.
[22:01] <sana> so thats mbit, not mb/s
[22:01] <Vic> what, are you on 56k?
[22:01] <Diablodoct0r> 1 MB can be a lot better than 50
[22:01] <Beardbeard> I have 7 MB download
[22:01] <Diablodoct0r> I have friends with 50 who lag insanely playing online
[22:01] <Beardbeard> less than half a MB upload
[22:01] <Helar> it shows 0,10MB right now
[22:01] <Helar> on speedtest
[22:01] <Diablodoct0r> Myself, never lag
[22:01] <Diablodoct0r> And I have 3 MB
[22:01] <Vic> oh
[22:01] <Vic> so you ARE on 56k

[22:02] <Helar> Too many users and its a wireless shit
[22:02] <Diablodoct0r> The lines your provider use
[22:02] <Vic> heh
[22:02] <Helar> i have seen 3,5mb though
[22:02] <Diablodoct0r> They matter
[22:02] <Vic> i had that kind of connection before helar
[22:02] <Helar> http://www.speedtest.net/result/875406190.png
[22:02] <Beardbeard> Yes, which is why pingtest is good
[22:02] <Diablodoct0r> In Norway, we have very very stable lines and not laggy ones
[22:02] <Beardbeard> It shows your jitter and ping
[22:02] <Beardbeard> along with your packet loss

[22:03] <Vic> >only
[22:03] <Diablodoct0r> Cue: If your lines are good, you don't need more than 20
[22:03] * mnjiman hides it under his pillow
[22:03] <Beardbeard> 7 mbit download, you can feel better than me cue
[22:03] <Vic> i'd be happy to have 4mbit
[22:03] <CyborgDragon> http://www.pingtest.net/result/20172680.png my connection
[22:03] <Beardbeard> my upload is half a mbit

[22:04] <quasi> you know australia is getting an internet filter soon, not unliek china?
[22:04] <Cue> Also, the upload is awful
[22:04] <CyborgDragon> now to speedtest
[22:04] <Helar> atleast my ping is pretty good considering it has to get the signal wireless from 15KM away
[22:04] <Cue> Virgin Media don't give you any sort of decent upload speed
[22:04] <Diablodoct0r> Cyborg that info is practically useless

[22:05] <ClassiestMedic> in the states
[22:05] <Shisno> but yeah gillard has probably lost the election thats coming up
[22:05] <ClassiestMedic> my upload and download speed
[22:05] <ClassiestMedic> would be about 100x better
[22:05] <Diablodoct0r> What's funny is that some of the slowest connection I've had is LAN wireless
[22:05] <Diablodoct0r> and that's 1000 MB
[22:05] <ClassiestMedic> also, this laptop is a shit

[22:24] <quasi> that, and i'm over calculus
[22:24] <SireTRM> You have to force-set the inability to move further in that direction.
[22:24] <sana> and move your box by the velocity
[22:24] <sana> so gravity accelerates the box down
[22:24] <sana> and if you press the jump key, your velocity is set to a specific number
[22:24] <sana> so it goes down
[22:24] <bildramer> ...
[22:24] <sana> but periodically drains by 5
[22:24] <bildramer> hm, I would use ticks anyway
[22:24] <sana> goes up*
[22:24] <bildramer> I'm talking about what happens in a single frame
[22:24] <Beardbeard> just turn off physics
[22:24] <bildramer> nulling the velocity won't work
[22:25] <Beardbeard> make your characters rocket into space when they move
[22:25] <bildramer> bouncing won't work
[22:25] <bildramer> finding the outermost pixel won't work
[22:25] <bildramer> wat do
[22:25] <sana> i dont understand
[22:25] <bildramer> hmm
[22:25] <bildramer> time for MS Paint
[22:25] <ZomBuster> those methods should work sort of
[22:25] <sorre> woo
[22:26] <ZomBuster> move box to point of collision and set velocity to 0 works p good
[22:26] <sorre> got stepmania fully functional on my ubuntu-powered XBMC box!
[22:26] <bildramer> ZomBuster, they led to perpetual motion, items randomly going inside the ground and so on

[22:54] <vurtual> like, targeted pasting

[22:55] <vurtual> and real-time data reading, so you can see mobs walking about from your satellite view
[22:55] <slowriot> ZomBuster: i'd quite like a very simple feature - the ability to queue multiple slices for output
[22:55] <ZomBuster> trail and error mostly bildramer
[22:55] <bildramer> ^
[22:55] <bildramer> or output all slices
[22:55] <bildramer> or output all data in a binary file
[22:56] <bildramer> and also sometimes chunks are missings or copied
[22:56] <vurtual> like, the whole view goes blue, zooms in at a 30 degree angle(from flat), and there's a grid over it, and anywhere you mouse over, it reads for things like mobs and features and chest contents
[22:56] <vurtual> so you can get an in-depth identification of things
[22:56] <vurtual> or just mousing over chests maybe, without the absurd sci-fi but whatever

[23:29] <bildramer> what the fuck, Minecraft
[23:29] <bildramer> won't work
[23:30] <Diablodoct0r> I'd say, "As long as there is a storyline of set events in which you play a role, your character has a story, or there is any "unique identitiy" to your player, it is an RPG"
[23:30] <Shadaez> and RPG today is leveling; but it's really a huge term

[23:31] <Diablodoct0r> But Minecraft ain't
[23:31] <Helar> GTA IV can be a RPG because it has money
[23:31] <Shadaez> Diablodoct0r the RPG genre has some way of increasing stats
[23:32] <Diablodoct0r> Not really
[23:32] <Diablodoct0r> "Role-Playing Game" does not include "Levelling Up Game"

[23:35] <Shadaez> Diablodoct0r well, what would you call levelupgaems, then?

[23:35] <Pyrosshade> so i save and go to main menu and reload
[23:35] <Pyrosshade> i jump again
[23:36] <Pyrosshade> i'm stuck AGAIN
[23:36] <Shadaez> Diablodoct0r then you could argue that progressive can mean more than levelng

[23:36] <Diablodoct0r> Yes
[23:36] <Diablodoct0r> It can
[23:36] <Shadaez> so just deal w/ it !

[23:37] <Gunmage> Or has someone already done that?
[23:37] <Azrooh> That's why they're all level-up games.

[23:52] <Marach> Shadaez: i get my newest game info from the topic in a wiihack channel
[23:52] <vurtual> So I zoom out of the airport in a moment, and begin to flee
[23:52] <Shadaez> Marach nerd
[23:52] <vurtual> nearly to the end, I get hit so bad my bike is pretty much unreachable, and I'm down to my last sliver of health(flying through the air, whee!)

[23:52] <vurtual> Then I proceed to use my half-life 2 training to avoid the cops entirely
