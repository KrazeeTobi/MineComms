[0:08] <Nightelf21> Did anyone know that sims is pixel?
[0:08] <Nightelf21> And everything on it was images?
[0:08] <TehButter> so, in binary
[0:08] <TehButter> the sum would be 01001000010110?
[0:08] <Demki> TehButter, he used glitched sand
[0:09] <TehButter> er... add 3 zeroes
[0:09] <Zode> there are 10 types of people that understand binary

[0:12] <TehButter> What
[0:12] <Demki> SumWon, using every finger as a bit, I have 10 fingers, each finger has 2 states(up or down), therefore, I can count in binary
[0:12] <Caleo2> redRum2k10: yo bro, turn off forced antialiasing. it makes minecraft look terrible
[0:12] <TehButter> Theres 17 bits at the answer box
[0:12] <TehButter> >:O

[0:14] <SumWon> Not on.
[0:14] <TehButter> well how do you figure out a 17 big number?
[0:14] <muddtusk> If God wills it, Demki.
[0:14] <TehButter> niy.
[0:14] <SumWon> I understand the logic of counting binary on your hands lol...
[0:14] <TehButter> bit**
[0:14] <Gunmage> I mean 13 bit numbers.

[0:16] <Demki> that's 2^20
[0:16] <Clonearmy3> Ok Guys I want a vote. Who is scarrier. Suicide zombies or Skeleton Archers
[0:16] <Demki> =|
[0:16] <SireTRM> Giant, suicide creepers.
[0:16] <Demki> there are 2^20 bytes in a megabyte
[0:16] <muddtusk> Suicide creepers
[0:17] <Kokopure> creepers definitely.
[0:17] <Kokopure> you can't hear them coming.
[0:17] <rob`> there are 1,000,000 bytes in a megabyte. That's what "mega" means.
[0:17] <muddtusk> What is 1/2 a byte?
[0:17] * C418 (C418@p5B3D4DEB.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:17] <Kokopure> they can kill you in one hit and they're silent.
[0:17] <Kokopure> of course they're the scariest.
[0:17] <Demki> muddtusk, each byte is 8 bits
[0:17] * Jougi (asd.asd@a91-155-83-247.elisa-laajakaista.fi) has joined #minecraft
[0:17] <Kokopure> right, and they're the ONLY mob that can fuck up your base
[0:17] <Demki> rob', MB and KB uses powers of 2
[0:17] <Kokopure> that's worth something
[0:17] <rob`> they do not
[0:17] <Demki> they do
[0:17] <Azathoth> within a week, there will be old men running the world
[0:17] <rob`> mibibyte and kibibytes use powers of 2
[0:17] * fuogo (Mibbit@76.197.11.9) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[0:17] <Clonearmy3> Rob 1000000 byts is an advertising thing made for the "common man"
[0:17] <Clonearmy3> bytes*
[0:18] <muddtusk> What is half of one byte?
[0:18] * Paul (Mibbit@88.118.7.65) has joined #minecraft
[0:18] <Clonearmy3> 4 bits
[0:18] <Clonearmy3> maddtusk
[0:18] <muddtusk> have you ever heard that called a nibble?
[0:18] <muddtusk> thats what I was fishing for
[0:18] <Clonearmy3> le sigh
[0:18] <rob`> technically a byte is a variable unit that can mean different things in different contexts
[0:18] <Demki> muddtusk, 8 bits is 1 byte.
[0:18] * Skintkingle (chatzilla@client-82-26-206-242.pete.adsl.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft

[0:18] <Paul> Hello, may I ask a question?
[0:18] * Kandit_ (Kandit@adsl-67-211-170.shv.bellsouth.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:18] <Azathoth> yes, Paul
[0:18] <Clonearmy3> Go ahead Paul
[0:18] <Paul> Is account sharing allowed?
[0:19] <redRum2k10> dont think so :D
[0:19] * Skintkingle (chatzilla@client-82-26-206-242.pete.adsl.virginmedia.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:19] <muddtusk> Can I predict question two?
[0:19] <Kokopure> "A character table ordered by nibbles." <--- well if that isn't the cutest thing I can't understand.
[0:19] <SumWon> rob`, it only changes if you're looking at RAM or hard drive space lulz
[0:19] <rob`> strictly speaking a byte is just an ordered set of bits
[0:19] <rob`> it doesn't have to be 8 bits
[0:19] <muddtusk> \Will account sharing get me banned?\
[0:19] <SumWon> Probably.
[0:19] <Paul> Yeah sure
[0:19] * Kandit (Kandit@adsl-67-211-170.shv.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:19] <Paul> Banned = ?
[0:19] <Azathoth> probably not
[0:19] <redRum2k10> hope so
[0:20] <muddtusk> Banished
[0:20] * PixelEater (brad@h225.231.30.71.static.ip.windstream.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:20] <Paul> Thus money stolen?
[0:20] <Azathoth> i'm sure there isn't anything in place to check for account sharing
[0:20] <Azathoth> and i don't think notch would take your money
[0:20] <Demki> rob', the bytes COMPUTERS use, are 8 bits.
[0:20] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[0:20] <Clonearmy3> Rob thats might be true but all modern computers use 8 bits in 1 byte
[0:20] <rob`> clonearmy3, Demki, SumWon: Your lack of understanding of both computing and the metric system is amusing
[0:20] <redRum2k10> only safety is the multiplayer
[0:20] <redRum2k10> i dont think that 2 players can play together with the same acc
[0:20] <SumWon> rob`, the amount of stick shoved up your ass is amusing.
[0:20] <Demki> rob', I understand the metric system very well, I live with it.
[0:21] <Azathoth> mmm... sticks
[0:21] <muddtusk> Guys at Geek Squad said my last hdd failed because it was covered in gigabitemarks
[0:21] <SumWon> Oh harr harr.
[0:21] <Paul> So basically, no defintive answer to my question
[0:21] <Clonearmy3> I understand both computers and the metric system but if you get a hard drive and it says 500 mb on the box it wont say 500mb in your computer
[0:21] <Paul> definitive*
[0:21] * rob` waves a canadian phd in compsci at you
[0:21] <Azathoth> lol

[0:22] <muddtusk> 3rd year?
[0:22] <SumWon> Again, rob`, stop being so full of yourself :D
[0:22] <shairn> the hard drive may have the designated space with a few bits missing, but the missing data there seems to be is actually used by system space.

[0:22] <muddtusk> then why are you buying hdds with <500mb storage?
[0:22] <Clonearmy3> yeah its a 4 year degree program
[0:22] <Clonearmy3> it was an example
[0:22] * electragician (electragic@207.98.247.147) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[0:22] <ChJees> Computer Science sounds kinda fun
[0:22] <Clonearmy3> last one i bought was 1.5tb
[0:22] <Clonearmy3> Its fun but not for everyone
[0:22] <muddtusk> How much was it truly?
[0:22] <SumWon> ChJees, it's what I'm doing.
[0:22] <ChJees> Like :P?
[0:22] <Clonearmy3> I cringed in the first few classes I had
[0:23] <Azathoth> last one i bought was 500gb :\ but that was 2 years ago and i'm poor
[0:23] <Clonearmy3> 1.36tb
[0:23] <rob`> all I'm saying is that if you want to use powers of 2, don't use metric units, is all, because they're not.
[0:23] <muddtusk> Very nice
[0:23] <ChJees> Programming is easy, but the theory a bit harder i think
[0:23] <rob`> there's established standard units - kibibyte, mibibyte, etc - for powers of 2 units
[0:23] <ChJees> I want theory!
[0:23] <Clonearmy3> Theory is fun but a pain at times
[0:24] <Azathoth> Clonearmy3, what university?
[0:24] <ChJees> I have only learn the programming part by myself :P

[0:26] <muddtusk> Aza, I was making a classist joke. I know there are a lot of cunts w/ resources.
[0:26] <muddtusk> You gonna get money money?
[0:26] <SumWon> School costs are high so the schools can laugh at you while you make them rich.
[0:27] <muddtusk> They don't laugh anymore. The joke is old. They just nod knowingly.
[0:27] <LordAidan> Unless they are public schools.
[0:27] <SumWon> Haha
[0:27] <Azathoth> erm
[0:27] <Azathoth> most of that money goes back to the students in some way
[0:27] <Azathoth> either through scholarships and grants, or to research, or to new construction/equipment
[0:27] <muddtusk> Right
[0:28] <Azathoth> and various other programs
[0:28] <muddtusk> Most of it does not go to you, though. Depending on where you go to school, much of it can go to athletics.
[0:28] <Clonearmy3> stupid athletics >.<
[0:28] <Azathoth> also, free city busses are much appreciated <3
[0:28] <Clonearmy3> lol
[0:28] <muddtusk> Eh, most research at my college was gov and corp funded

[1:13] <Azathoth> tj505050, it was an auto-kick. it thought you were spamming because i guess you lagged and all your messages got sent at once

[1:14] <Helar> yay i guessed a train!
[1:14] <Azathoth> you should have shot her, vurtual
[1:14] <Azathoth> and said you thought she was going to harm you
[1:14] <tj505050> i got kicked by a person

[1:14] <vurtual> she was already inside by the time she was violent.
[1:14] <SumWon> It's like 11PM "Notch Time" isn't it?
[1:14] <vurtual> then she's stomping around and angry when my dad won't actually humor her request to "have a talk" with me
[1:14] <Helar> yes
[1:14] <vurtual> and because I won't listen to their lies :D
[1:15] <tj505050> lol is it the 18 thhhere

[1:15] <Dman757> Have a "talk" with you? That sounds kinda funny.
[1:15] <SumWon> So we can go there at any time to see what the it is for notch.
[1:15] <vurtual> Dman757 yeah
[1:15] <Dman757> For stating your opinion on the whole thing?

[1:16] <vurtual> and timezones each have their own planet
[1:17] <vurtual> er, like
[1:17] <Azathoth> i'm guessing we'll go by earth time for official stuff
[1:17] <vurtual> each planet would have a desegnation before its timezones
[1:17] <Azathoth> but maybe have local planetary time
[1:17] <SumWon> Hey vurtual, http://lunarclock.org/
[1:17] <SumWon> LOL
[1:17] <Azathoth> then all kinds of conversions :\
[1:17] <vurtual> universal time will help
[1:17] <Azathoth> because if you're on a planet with a different day length, it would get pretty confusing going by a 24 hour clock
[1:18] <Dman757> Randomnation you could use cartograph to find out
[1:18] <Azathoth> you'd never be able to guess the time by the light
[1:18] <SumWon> I can't wait till humans master quantum entanglement. We coule use it for instant communication between planets :D. You could go to mars and surf the intertubes with no ping whatsoever.
[1:18] <Azathoth> fuck yeah. watching streaming porn from mars.
[1:18] <Azathoth> oh god
[1:18] <heavenImplode> Azathoth: Duration != clock time
[1:18] <SumWon> Well, you COULD watch streaming porn from mars, but you'd have to wait about 40 minutes for the stream to start.
[1:18] <tj505050> its 11:18 pm in notch time
[1:19] <SumWon> Once it starts, it would buffer pretty fast though.
[1:19] <rob`> quantum entanglement is already being used for encryption key exchange over distances as long as a few kilometers. It's neat tech.
[1:19] <SumWon> It's the latency that kills you
[1:19] <SumWon> Orly rob`?
[1:19] <Azathoth> yeah, i'd rather not wait 40 minutes for buffering
[1:19] <SumWon> I haven't read a whole lot into it, but it's definitely a fascinating subject
[1:19] <rob`> yeah, look up quantum cryptography on google
[1:19] <Azathoth> what do you mean, heavenImplode ?
[1:19] <rob`> it's not used for message data yet, though
[1:19] <SumWon> I think I shall

[1:20] <Randomnation> So
[1:20] <Randomnation> How is world placement going to work in SMP?
[1:20] <Randomnation> Everyone spawns at the same spot?
[1:20] <Dman757> I think the single most "retarded" argument I heard against adoption of a universal time was "Well what happens when its 04:00 and its light out somewhere?"
[1:21] <Azathoth> yeah, but you'd have a completely different date system
[1:21] * AndrewPH is now known as AndrewPH|AFK
[1:21] <SumWon> It's not. SMP is going to be so epic it will create a black hole in the center of the Earth and kill us all.
[1:21] <Randomnation> =@
[1:21] <Randomnation> The wiki says that the alpha maps can be 8x the length of earth
[1:21] <heavenImplode> Azaroth: Date systems are fine. Clock time doesn't need to get in the way of dates.
[1:21] <SumWon> If you have a 50 TB hard drive, Drakkar
[1:21] <SumWon> Randomnation*
[1:21] <SumWon> lolol not sure how I got Drakkar there

[1:22] <tj505050> lol
[1:22] <Randomnation> jinky? ;o
[1:22] <vurtual> everything will be measured in unix time now
[1:22] <SumWon> lmao
[1:22] <Cat> http://www.youtube.com/v/3BzxfEEd1DQ
[1:22] <Nam-Ereh-Eon> has anyone else run into minecraft not deleting chunks when deleting a world and then having it use those chunks when you generate a new world?
[1:22] <evaldusia> I wish no one invented clocks
[1:22] <vurtual> BINARY uinx time
[1:22] <evaldusia> would be awesme
[1:22] <heavenImplode> I kind of like the concept of Swatch metric time, to be fair.

[1:22] <SumWon> you mean the number of seconds since the 1970...?
[1:22] <SumWon> -the
[1:22] <Azathoth> i guess it would just get confusing if the date switched in the middle of the day :D

[1:41] <heavenImplode> Cats can piss off.
[1:41] <vurtual> All the people who argue for metric are always HURR BASE TEN and OLOLOLOL IT'S MEASURED FROM SOME BIZARRE PLANET MEASUREMENT AHURRRR
[1:42] <vurtual> I'm not a computer, son.
[1:42] <heavenImplode> A cat almost KILLED me with its claws when I was little :<
[1:42] <vurtual> Being able to divide more numbers cleanly out of units, and actually having rough comparisons of them at hand(ahurrr) is useful.
[1:42] <vurtual> When I was much younger.
[1:42] <vurtual> Before any of you were born
[1:42] <vurtual> My brother had a cat, this cat was outside, and a bit spooked, so I jokingly went "rawr" at it
[1:42] <vurtual> then, he screams at me
[1:42] <vurtual> and I'm sitting there
[1:43] <vurtual> and he lets the cat in, which is rearing to attack something.

[1:43] <heavenImplode> It's weird that vurtual uses British Imperial measurements when Britain has moved on to more sensible forms of measuring.
[1:43] <vurtual> It then proceeds to jump up onto my face and tear it off
[1:43] <SumWon> I'm 17.526 tall.
[1:43] <vurtual> blood everywhere
[1:43] <vurtual> and then he gets bit pulling the cat off
[1:43] <vurtual> and gets his arm infected
[1:43] <vurtual> now apparently I'm the evil, horrible person in this story, and whenever it's brought up he painfully hits me in the leg.
[1:44] <vurtual> Next time he tries to hit me on the leg, I'm ramming scissors through his throat.
[1:44] <ZomBuster> and that's why imperial measurments are EVIL

[1:51] <vurtual> how is that funny cial
[1:51] <vurtual> people agreeing?
[1:51] <Arsonide> My friend complains about Minecraft because there are no persistent needs that you have to fulfill. You could survive just as easily by surrounding yourself in dirt as building all these structures. There's no need to go out and kill stuff.
[1:51] <Arsonide> I told him multiplayer will pretty much fix that.
[1:51] <Cial> vurtual, its funny becaues people think it can be done
[1:51] <Arsonide> As inaction isn't going to stop a player from killing you.
[1:51] <vurtual> I disagree ahurrhurr
[1:51] <SumWon> Haha
[1:51] <Lmaoboat> I agree with your friend
[1:52] <SumWon> Other players will be the most dangerous game.

[2:03] <SumWon> Except for one hole where arrows could shoot through

[2:46] <vurtual> but sliding-out

[3:24] <Randomnation> Tips on blowing TNT safely from a distance? I've tried wool, didn't work
[3:25] <Randomnation> I ran out of TNT so
[3:25] <SumWon> Randomnation, hit TNT, run away?
[3:25] <Shadaez> that's p cheap
[3:25] <SumWon> Or redwire
[3:25] <Randomnation> It's way down
[3:25] <ialdbaoloth> do you have NBTedit?
[3:25] <Randomnation> I was planning to place one high and hit it
[3:25] <SumWon> red stuff + TNT + switch = remote detonation
[3:25] <Randomnation> so it'd fall down
[3:25] <Randomnation> but I placed the last one by mistake :(
[3:25] <SumWon> lol
[3:25] <ialdbaoloth> I have no problems with cheating extra ingredients for purposes of science

[3:40] <Arsonide> I've been wanting to study up on logic gates, my friend and I are going to play coop and it's sounding like since I'm a programmer I'll be messing with all the redstone, since obviously electronics and programming are remotely related.

[3:46] <Arsonide> You guys missed my sarcasm.
[3:46] <Arsonide> Since electronics and programming are REMOTELY RELATED.

[3:53] <vurtual> also guys I have an idea on how to get fat people less fat
[3:53] <vurtual> we build them special scooters
[3:53] <vurtual> which are commanded by pedalling
[3:53] <geraldbrent> cool
[3:53] <Conundrumer> is that suppose to be funny?
[3:53] <vurtual> not like a bicycle, motorized, but they have to actually use effort to get anywhere
[3:53] <vurtual> after a while they'll be used enough to everyday casual pedalling that it won't overtax them, and they'll burn some weight to boot.
[3:53] <Phil> DONT DISS ME GUYIES IM SO FAT
[3:53] <Phil> STOP MAKING FUNNY OF ME

[3:54] <Phil> know what Ive always though, if we hooked generatorz up to all the running crap in gyms, they could each generate a lot of power
[3:54] <Phil> why dont we do this...?
[3:54] <vurtual> I honestly don't know.
[3:54] <vurtual> Generator bikes are fun though

[4:18] <Cial> yes? to one or both?
[4:18] <J1288> both
[4:18] <Cial> how much ram does your system have?
[4:18] <J1288> 2 Gig
[4:18] <Vicrry> So you tried both? And also, that kinda sounds like a hardware problem, like a heat or bad chip
[4:18] <Cial> hm
[4:19] <J1288> well that's odd, I play modern games like Mass Effect and stuff for hours with no problems

[4:36] <J1288> I really hope is not my HDD, I purchased it 4 months ago
[4:36] <slowriot> i mean
[4:36] <slowriot> o_
[4:36] <Joelyyyy> out of the 12 that ive purchased (for myself or other computers i've built) i've never had any issues
[4:36] <Quatroking> sure, high speeds, booyah
[4:36] <Quatroking> as if everyone requires that
[4:36] <J1288> but so far Indev hasn't locked up
[4:36] <Azure> why wouldn't one want a fast computer?

[4:37] <Joelyyyy> it would slightly, as read/write times would increase, but its not worth the pricetag imo
[4:37] <slowriot> that's a stupid thing to say
[4:37] <Azure> afaik a SSD will make the proccesses faster then if you had a HDD
[4:37] <slowriot> of course a faster hard drive allows you to access your programs faster
[4:37] <Quatroking> slowriot, with the exception of shitty old pc's that run on OEM hardware, yes
[4:37] <slowriot> unless you don't keep your programs on your hard drive
[4:37] <slowriot> Quatroking: so the speed with which you read data makes no difference to you?
[4:38] <Quatroking> as long as its not some shitty PII speed, no.
[4:38] <slowriot> or are you just suggesting that current off the shelf disk drives are fast enough?
[4:38] <Randomnation> So, shall I ride to the end of the worlds on my boat?

[4:38] <Joelyyyy> do eet
[4:38] <Quatroking> My simple 640GB drives from WD work fine, and when I do need to move large amounts of data interdrive, it doesn't really take that long either, less than a minute for 10 gigs
[4:38] <Quatroking> hell, I put it on the background and go watch porn while its busy
[4:38] <vurtual> So my craving for helicopters occoured after I realized boat rudders lose efficiency at speed
[4:39] <slowriot> has anyone worked out how fast boats are btw, and how long it would take to cross the world?
[4:39] <liq3> slowriot: i could figure it out.
[4:39] <vurtual> and after I realized my boat wasn't fast enough compared to the song I play while boating around
[4:39] <liq3> i'll do it later.
[4:39] <slowriot> ace

[4:40] <Quatroking> So anyways, unless people for some reason need to transport shitloads of data frequently, whats so wrong about conventional hdd's
[4:40] <slowriot> and make them go IN THE SKYYYYYYYYY
[4:40] <vurtual> no seriously
[4:40] <slowriot> Quatroking: i don't think anyone said there's something WRONG with hard drives
[4:41] <Quatroking> sdd's seem to be more suited for servers
[4:41] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL1CJgd9oRw boats are not fast enough for this
[4:41] <vurtual> I want to go like, 80MPH+ and then have biiig oceans to zip along
[4:41] <slowriot> i think someone just said they had an SDD, and you went on a rant
[4:41] <ZzZGuy> I hear minecraft has some sort of online DRM, what might this be?
[4:41] * Amatsu is now known as GMAmatsu
[4:41] <vurtual> ZzZGuy you launch it off the internet.
[4:41] <vurtual> so yeah
[4:41] <slowriot> 80mph is too slow :/
[4:41] <Quatroking> I ranted about how people all of the sudden need to show off with their sdd's
[4:41] <vurtual> It's not so much DRM as how it launches
[4:41] <vurtual> 88MPH
[4:41] <slowriot> that's more like it!
[4:41] <ZzZGuy> so you need to be online to start the game?
[4:41] <vurtual> then you accelerate in time, warping ahead if it's clear
[4:41] <slowriot> Quatroking: so your rant is really about people showing off shiny new technology?
[4:41] <vurtual> yeah
[4:42] <Quatroking> have fun people, spending shitloads of money on a drive with less capacity than the drives I used three years ago :D

[4:42] <ZzZGuy> ah, ty. I'll have to think harder about if I want this game or not then.
[4:42] <slowriot> shit quatro, why so trolly?
[4:42] <ZzZGuy> orly?
[4:42] <vurtual> ...it's not really a problem.
[4:42] <slowriot> people can buy whatever drives they want
[4:42] <vurtual> I mean
[4:42] <ZzZGuy> so what is this offline client?
[4:42] <vurtual> You casuals
[4:42] <Quatroking> slowriot, its kind of like showing off a hybrid car with 20 HP
[4:42] <vurtual> ZzZGuy there's 2 links to the newest dev version of the game
[4:42] <slowriot> sure, horses for courses
[4:42] <vurtual> one is run in the browser as an applet
[4:42] <slowriot> you can't deny there are legitimate applications for SSD
[4:43] <vurtual> the other runs from an exe o rsomething
[4:43] <slowriot> but it's hardly a panacea
[4:43] <vurtual> and I think it has offline-paly

[4:43] <Vicrry> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136456 <- I'd probably get one of these instead of SSD - I'd like a SSD for the robustness too. You can play soccer with one and Windows will still boot :)
[4:43] <vurtual> for the twelve dollars you'll use for this it's a small enough investment that you won't get really that bored.
[4:43] <Quatroking> the way I see it, unless you do a lot of data stuff (archives, servers) you don't really need an ssd
[4:43] <vurtual> But unless in rare occasions, or during an update/around friends, there's nothing really to do
[4:43] <Quatroking> oh well
[4:43] <vurtual> but wheee boats
[4:43] <slowriot> Vicrry: sure, they survive being run over by trucks, but they don't survive having data written on one place more than a hundred thousand times or so
[4:43] * DimJim (chatzilla@cpe-24-242-36-94.hot.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[4:43] <Quatroking> I'll just listen to 7. Agree to disagree.
[4:44] <slowriot> so it's a matter of what kind of "robustness" you value more
[4:44] <vurtual> Quatroking is a coward and scared of a nonexistant argument
[4:44] <vurtual> aaanyways
[4:44] <Vis{AFK}> you're all wrong
[4:44] <Vis{AFK}> >:D
[4:44] <vurtual> There's probably some OICW-fan here who will use SSDs as an argument for why we should use it
[4:44] <Quatroking> and vurtual is too much of a pussy t actually participate in the whole discussion, hmm?
[4:44] <Quatroking> ;)
[4:44] <Quatroking> to*
[4:44] <vurtual> nah
[4:44] <slowriot> i don't think anyone even disagreed... i just wanted to know why quatro has such a chip on his shoulder about ssd
[4:45] <vurtual> there wasn't one in the firs tplace
[4:45] <vurtual> slowriot because PEOPLE HINTED ABOUT USING THEM IN A NORMAL COMPUTER
[4:45] <slowriot> how dare they!
[4:45] <vurtual> How could ANYONE ever do such a HORRIBLE CRIME AND WASTE OF MONEY?
[4:45] <slowriot> how dare ANYONE waste their OWN MONEY!
[4:45] <Vis{AFK}> I waste money all the time
[4:45] <Vis{AFK}> and I'm terrible at TF2
[4:45] <Quatroking> slowriot: I'm not really too much of a fan about ssd's yet simply because people are better off with normal hdd's

[4:46] <Vis{AFK}> I need help.
[4:46] <vurtual> SSDs have plenty of fine uses
[4:46] <Quatroking> "omg this pc has an ssd ITS SO AWESOME"
[4:46] <Vis{AFK}> nvidia GeForce or ATI radeon?
[4:46] <vurtual> ATI
[4:46] <slowriot> Quatroking: gigabytes per pound/dollar/whatever, is only one measure of value... there are other things people may value more over a given technology
[4:46] <vurtual> unless linux
[4:46] <Vis{AFK}> You sure?
[4:46] <Quatroking> yes yes i know
[4:46] <slowriot> having said that, SSDs are neither the fastest nor the most expensive storage mediums

[4:46] <Quatroking> the thing is, why do home users need superfast drives
[4:46] <Vis{AFK}> I'm getting the 57(50?)
[4:46] <vurtual> SSDs are compact and durable
[4:46] <slowriot> i don't know, ask the individual home users
[4:47] <vurtual> this makes them useful for wrist-mounted computers
[4:47] <vurtual> where you can't afford to have a hard drive
[4:47] <Quatroking> lets just end the ssd crap and move on to ati versus nvidia fanboy wars, okay
[4:47] <slowriot> if someone made the decision to spend more cash on an ssd instead of a platter drive, they probably think they have a good reason for that
[4:47] <slowriot> even if the only reason is bragging rights
[4:47] <vurtual> so now I'm IRCing with you guys thanks to these SSD techs

[6:24] <Conundrumer> my hex display has 0-9 and A-F

[6:29] <ialdbaoloth> I just timed it, seems like both around 10
[6:30] <vurtual> Not "airships"
[6:30] <Scrippy> But Notch said he's keeping thing somewhat fantasyish.
[6:30] <vurtual> Proper, functionally-flies-like-a-helicopter helicopter
[6:30] <CompuHacker> Oh yerr. Crafting should make time skip by, so you can do your crafting at night instead of waiting.
[6:30] <Scrippy> And I agree with that.

[6:56] <Scrippy> You ca just break the minecart

[7:17] <Scrippy> It makes it reeeeally hard to do things non-locally.
[7:18] <Scrippy> That would work.

[7:38] <funnyguy3D> haha you have summer school
[7:39] <funnyguy3D> i sometimes get the cavern effect without even being in a cavern!
[7:39] <Rooster> Worse part is that this week Notch is giving out SMP invites.
[7:39] <CompuHacker> Cave sounds are entirely random imo.
[7:39] <CompuHacker> I hear them everywhere.
[7:39] <SumWon> funnyguy3D, they happen if you are near/in a cavern.
[7:39] <LordAidan> Nah
[7:39] <LordAidan> If you hear them
[7:39] <SumWon> Perhaps you're walking over one?
[7:40] <LordAidan> then you are near a cave entrance
[7:40] <SumWon> Not necessarily an entrance, LordAidan.
[7:40] <CompuHacker> a cave entrance is the same as a grassy knoll, or a mountain, or an ocean
[7:40] <SumWon> There just may be a tunnel neary
[7:40] <LordAidan> Anything leading into one
[7:40] <CompuHacker> There is no distinction.
[7:40] <LordAidan> You know what I mean
[7:41] <funnyguy3D> who here got the snow map first try?
[7:41] <CompuHacker> And every try after.
[7:42] <Rooster> I had the generate a good 20 times.
[7:42] <CompuHacker> My game probabilties are rigged or something.
[7:42] <SumWon> I got it on the second try
[7:42] <funnyguy3D> i got it first time
[7:42] <Rooster> fag
[7:42] <funnyguy3D> next time was normal

[7:42] <CompuHacker> to the most anticipated game ever
[7:42] <Rooster> funnyguy3D: Don't get your hopes up.
[7:42] <CompuHacker> what a horrible idea.
[7:43] <funnyguy3D> one thing i'm unhapy about with alpha is you cant choose what kind of map you want
[7:43] <LordAidan> Totally
[7:43] <Rooster> Most likely only supreme regulars will get it.
[7:43] <Phil> who cares about invites? seriously its not going to be fun so who cares

[8:14] <CyborgDragon> MOOOOOOOOOOO
[8:14] <Shadaez> Wikipedia originally ran UseModWiki, a general wiki script by Clifford Adams. In January 2002, we switched to a PHP script, which in turn was completely overhauled the following July to create what we now call MediaWiki.
[8:14] <CyborgDragon> I live.

[8:16] <CyborgDragon> so, i just got down playing majora's mask again, with interruptions of red dead redemption, and now i'm downloading GTA IV and installing fallout 3 again

[8:17] <So_Useless> So, WoW doesn't have you by the balls, it's gently caressing them?
[8:18] <So_Useless> Otherwise, I doubt you would be alright with it.
[8:18] <CyborgDragon> i've done this same thing 3 times now
[8:18] <Risugami> using tile set, it's okay

[8:22] <SumWon> Was a dark dark day.
[8:23] <CyborgDragon> my parents threw away my NES, SNES, genesis, and some other old consoles i cant remember
[8:23] <So_Useless> My Stepmom and Dad decided to keep mine. Then she pawned it for cigarettes.
[8:23] <SumWon> And my genesis D:
[8:23] <Pel> my dad knew not to touch any of my gaming machine or id destroy his motorbike
[8:23] <Ezral> I pulled out my SNES after I found a classic game store in town
[8:23] <furyhunter> AND MY AXE
[8:23] <SumWon> No, he threw them away when I was like 8. And still played them.
[8:23] <CyborgDragon> well actually they gave the SNES to my 4 year old(at the time) cousins who ruined the thing
[8:23] <Ezral> Bought the original Star Fox for $5 :D

[8:24] <furyhunter> whose ass was beat
[8:24] <So_Useless> Except I never made it past the second level.
[8:24] <SumWon> That's cool o.o
[8:24] <So_Useless> My tiny baby hands couldn't pull it off.
[8:24] <Pel> soo thats how i got my NES console
[8:24] <CyborgDragon> i wanted to kill them at first, but then i learned that my favorite ones(the twins) weren't the ones who ruined it, and in fact played it quite frequently
[8:24] <SumWon> lol So_Useless, why So_Useless

[8:27] <Ezral> I just stood slack jawed and she laughed at me.

[8:36] <EmpiresBane> i never sell consoles
[8:36] <EmpiresBane> and rarely games
[8:36] <vurtual> the problem being
[8:36] <So_Useless> I didn't want to. I had to pay my tuition and time was running out.
[8:37] <vurtual> I can only IRC from bed using the upper-network because my bed is outsiiide
[8:37] <So_Useless> Your bed is outside?
[8:37] <Ezral> Zelda is my favorite series, when I read about the story to Skyward Sword I giggled like a small girl.
[8:37] <Rooster> That's pretty stupid.
[8:37] <Pel> you live in a dog house?

[8:37] <vurtual> not the dog house though
[8:37] <So_Useless> Umbrellabed.

[8:37] <vurtual> in the sense that I have used an RV as an awesome place to sleep in for a while now
[8:37] <Rooster> Well gentlemen, I'm off to summer school tommorow, it's been an honor serving with you.

[8:38] <So_Useless> I guess it depends on outside of what.
[8:38] <CyborgDragon> so did i, so did i
[8:38] <SumWon> FUCK...Damn cave ambience
[8:38] <vurtual> yeah but it's on the router that can be reached from outside
[8:38] <So_Useless> I haven't read the story on it, yet.
[8:38] <vurtual> so like
[8:38] <vurtual> anyone have any idea why ONE site wouldn't load?

[8:38] <SumWon> A loud ass "WRRRYYY" sound, as I'm all freaking out mining some red stone hoping a creeper doesn't sneak up on me..
[8:39] <vurtual> but EVERY OTHER SITE works fine
[8:39] <Pel> its been barred because fakku.net is a bad site
[8:39] <CyborgDragon> so_useless it details the creation of the master sword and the discovery of hyrule
[8:39] <Pel> and you should feel bad for draining all the bandwidth
[8:39] <SumWon> haaah fakku

[8:40] <SumWon> The hive rotfl
[8:41] <Ezral> Endless Zelda shirts, hats, and pins
[8:41] <Pel> i made my own pillow cases with hylian crest on it
[8:41] <SumWon> That's too awesome
[8:41] <vurtual> is the sword genuinely functional as a sword, Ezral?
[8:41] <Ezral> $200 custom made, one-of-a-kind Zelda shoes
[8:41] <Pel> mine is :D
[8:41] <Soviet> now, i need to make a train station
[8:41] <Arsonide> What wouth South-Southwest be in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds? I'm consulting a star map...
[8:41] <Ezral> The sword is for display only, though some light welding can change that.
[8:41] <CyborgDragon> sadly, i have no zelda paraphernalia(because i cant buy any), i'm just a big fan who knows almost every detail of every game, and own(ed) every game, except the CD-i and BS Zeldas, though I could've gotten the CD-i zeldas, but i passed it up
[8:42] <Ezral> CD-i are like abortions, they don't count.
[8:42] <SumWon> lmao
[8:42] <So_Useless> Could you get arrested for cleansing the world of evils like burglary with such a sword?
[8:42] <vurtual> I' mnot even a zelda nerd
[8:42] <mnjiman> Soviet: i love that idea
[8:42] <So_Useless> Cull those robbers.

[8:43] <Ezral> So I can attack robbers like a gentlemen.
[8:43] <Ezral> gentleman*
[8:43] <CyborgDragon> the CD-i's are only good because they're like one of those bad movies that's so bad it's ridiculously funny
[8:43] <So_Useless> I want a sword that is disguised as a shotgun... but the handle shoots poison darts.

[8:45] <CyborgDragon> my metroid fusion's battery died, so no saving any more, i eventually lost it
[8:45] <vurtual> I think I might buy the handheld ones multiple times
[8:45] <Ezral> I have the Prime collection but I've only beaten the 3rd one.
[8:45] <vurtual> so I can have more saves
[8:45] <So_Useless> Yeah. I suck at the 2d games. Aiming with the keyboard... bleh.
[8:45] <Soviet> i am designing the current hive for prepartion in my multiplayer server
[8:45] <vurtual> I somehow blanked my fusion saves once
[8:45] <SumWon> Aaaw, I hate that...
[8:45] <vurtual> it was devestating
[8:45] <CyborgDragon> my metroid and super metroid were given away with my NES and SNES
[8:45] <SumWon> My pokemon blue battery died xD

[8:47] <Ezral> Because I'm going as Red to Comic-con

[8:47] <SumWon> I like lightning, but it fried one of my computers once, which makes me *sadface*
[8:47] <CyborgDragon> gameboy pocket*
[8:47] <funnyguy3D> so less worry
[8:47] <So_Useless> I love any weather other than blazing hot, cloudless but somehow horrifyingly humid weather.

[8:49] <CyborgDragon> not only did the screen shatter, but there were a lot of fried components inside
[8:49] <So_Useless> If I remember correctly, they are a couple of inches of glass... maybe it just seemed bigger because I haven't seen a CRT screen taken apart since I was a kid.
[8:49] <CyborgDragon> i was like 5 when this happened
[8:49] <vurtual> so, guys, maybe, just maybe
[8:49] <CyborgDragon> surprisingly, i dont have a phobia of thunder from it

[8:50] <So_Useless> We were cleaning out the shed and my brother cut his arm on a rusty nail. I managed to convince him that he would get tetanus and gangrene and that they might have to amputate the arm.
[8:50] <CyborgDragon> tetanus is lockjaw -.-

[9:38] <SumWon> In terms of SMP?
[9:38] <vurtual> but be super-slow
[9:38] <funnyguy3D> saved my game
[9:38] <vurtual> as in, slow, but tools are faster
[9:38] <SumWon> Wut?
[9:38] <vurtual> and only return ore for digging it with a wood pickaxe
[9:38] <funnyguy3D> sumwon what you talkin about

[9:41] <vurtual> so basically you know what'd be funny?
[9:41] <vurtual> If creepers got "angry" when around you, in order to attack you
[9:41] <SumWon> Easy Broski
[9:41] <vurtual> but otherwise were exceedingly hard to encounter
[9:41] <Risugami> you wire both doors
[9:41] <SumWon> No, Risugami
[9:42] <vurtual> and when they are angry, they start making deep, loud sucking sounds
[9:42] <SumWon> Make one wire come off of the switch
[9:42] <Broski> How...the hell...
[9:42] <SumWon> Then make it split
[9:42] <vurtual> like, someone comically inhaling hard
[9:42] <vurtual> angry
[9:42] <TehButter> Broski:
[9:42] <SumWon> Have on wire go to one door and the other wire to the other door
[9:42] <SumWon> Now, invert one wire
[9:42] <SumWon> :D
[9:42] <TehButter> What they said.
[9:42] <TehButter> >.>
[9:42] <Risugami> which wires both doors....
[9:42] <funnyguy3D> broski you got redstone?

[9:45] <TehButter> Its kind of like this
[9:45] <Risugami> if you don't know what they are already, just ignore them :P
[9:45] <TehButter> If a redstone torch is on a brick,
[9:45] <funnyguy3D> WOK DOM U
[9:45] <vandelay> Yea Im new and all and I can't really comment too much on minecraft since I've only been palying for like 48 hours
[9:45] <TehButter> And power is coming to that brick,
[9:45] <TehButter> The torch will turn off
[9:45] <vandelay> BUT IF ONE MORE FUCKING CREEPER DIES NEAR MY FUCKING HOUSE
[9:45] <vandelay> AND BLOWS IT UP
[9:45] <vandelay> ILL BREAK MY GODDAMN SCREEN
[9:45] <vandelay> Just had to get that off my chest.
[9:45] <funnyguy3D> lol
[9:45] <Shrub> lol vandelay
[9:45] <funnyguy3D> thats counterproductive
[9:45] <vandelay> My entire house is surrounded by them and spiders
[9:45] <Shrub> Creepers never touch my shit ;-;
[9:45] <Risugami> break his face instead
[9:45] <vandelay> And they keep blowing up my house
[9:45] <Ghos7Soldier> I'm new as well. Well, to the single player alpha part anyways.
[9:45] <vandelay> and i have to rebuild it and the tunnels
[9:45] <vandelay> FUCK THIS GAME GRANDMA
[9:45] <TehButter> Ive only seen 2 monsters in my *life*
[9:45] <Risugami> they want a hug

[9:46] <TehButter> at least,
[9:46] <vandelay> TehButter, They stalk me NONSTOP
[9:46] <TehButter> life in Alpha.
[9:46] <funnyguy3D> they blow up the redstone?
[9:46] <vandelay> And im only on normal
[9:46] <SumWon> Broski
[9:46] <TehButter> Thats creepy, vandelay :O
[9:46] <Risugami> they blow up everything
[9:46] <Ghos7Soldier> I'm not bothered by the creepers at all.
[9:46] <TehButter> ^
[9:46] <funnyguy3D> they blow up for no reason?
[9:46] <TehButter> what?
[9:46] <vandelay> I've killed maybe... 30 skeletons, 30-40 spiders, and too many creepers to count
[9:46] <TehButter> yes, creepers explode
[9:46] <Bodie> eating horse meat was just legalised in australia
[9:46] <Bodie> :P
[9:46] <SumWon> BROOOSKIIII
[9:46] <Risugami> they blow in your face
[9:46] <TehButter> Bodie:
[9:46] <TehButter> What.
[9:47] <funnyguy3D> no i mean your randomly running around you house?
[9:47] <vandelay> They've blown up my house/tunnels about 4-5 times
[9:47] <Bodie> lol its odd
[9:47] <SumWon> I made him a diagram...
[9:47] <Bodie> i didn't know people WANTED to eat horse
[9:47] <TehButter> Er... what, funnyguy?
[9:47] <SumWon> But he disappeared...
[9:47] <TehButter> You confuse me :D
[9:47] <vurtual> so, this mysterious internet outage wouldn't be so bad
[9:47] <funnyguy3D> are they blowing up your redstone because your near it? or because theyre just blowing it up
[9:47] <vandelay> Are monsters like creepers and spiders not supposed to die from sunlight?

[9:48] <TehButter> He never said they blew up his redstone o.o"
[9:48] <vurtual> if an attractive, ideal girl in a bikini with very large and perky breasts suddenly crawled ontop of me, and wanted me to have my way with her
[9:48] <Risugami> i wish pigs would ignite in sunlight
[9:48] <Ghos7Soldier> Walk in base for night. Walk out at day and see burning enemies.
[9:48] <TehButter> Risu: WTF.
[9:48] <Pharod42> So this is odd. Minecraft has, since the cactus update, been slightly slower but still playable.ing practicallyender in catograph now, everything practically grinds to a halt for several minutes.
[9:48] <funnyguy3D> teh i dont really get how they're blowing up your stuff without you near it
[9:48] <Shrub> vurtual: Go on.
[9:49] <funnyguy3D> vurtual go on
[9:49] <vurtual> not until you fix my internet :|
[9:49] <Pharod42> Note that I could run them together just fine before.
[9:49] <Risugami> vurtual go on
[9:49] <SumWon> vurtual, I thought you yourself were a girl.
[9:49] * Shrub fixes vurtual's internet
[9:49] <TehButter> funnyguy, THEY DONT.
[9:49] <funnyguy3D> well thats what you were telling me!
[9:49] <TehButter> Creepers only go boom when you are near them
[9:49] <TehButter> When?
[9:49] <Shrub> SumWon, put 2+2 together v.v;;
[9:49] <TehButter> I never said that o.o
[9:49] <funnyguy3D> yes you did
[9:49] <SumWon> lol
[9:49] <Risugami> 22
[9:49] <vurtual> mhm SumWon
[9:49] <TehButter> No i didnt.
[9:50] <TehButter> Proof or it didnt happen D:
[9:50] <vurtual> girl on girl is hot amirite?
[9:50] <SumWon> Are you sure you're a girl?
[9:50] <SumWon> xD
[9:50] <vurtual> mmmmhm
[9:50] * SumWon shrugs
[9:50] <vurtual> no idea what shrub is though
[9:50] <vurtual> are they one of those plants

[9:51] * nilzero (chatzilla@c-75-66-106-86.hsd1.tn.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:51] <TehButter> that creepers blew up randomkly?
[9:51] <TehButter> o_o
[9:51] <vurtual> Creepers SHOULD blow up randomly
[9:51] <vurtual> but firing fragments off
[9:51] <vurtual> which are the block-breakers
[9:51] <TehButter> What, no
[9:51] <funnyguy3D> they keep blowing up my house
[9:51] <vurtual> or like, only breaking a few blocks
[9:51] <TehButter> Because then a creeper could just spawn in a cave
[9:51] <TehButter> And blow up
[9:51] <vurtual> randomly, within their predicted blast pattern
[9:51] <vandelay> Creepers spawn every time I build something
[9:51] <Risugami> because you are nearby possibly
[9:51] <vandelay> AND BLOW IT UP

[9:55] <vurtual> shoving a lot of skittles into your mouth
[9:56] <TehButter> I dig for 3 hours and, if im lucky, 5 redstone and 10 iron
[9:56] <Broski> Thats mate :)
[9:56] <vurtual> then it burns and dries your throat for a bit
[9:56] <SumWon> Me too TehButter. But I like my island
[9:56] <TehButter> Hergy..
[9:56] <SumWon> It's great for defence.
[9:56] <hergy7> yes?
[9:56] <SumWon> I don't mine on my island. Tried that...found crap
[9:56] <TehButter> It should keep going
[9:56] <TehButter> does it stop?
[9:56] <hergy7> yes
[9:56] <SumWon> So, I use a boat and go find caves
[9:56] <TehButter> Well idk.
[9:56] <hergy7> it just turns into a black/white screen
[9:56] <SumWon> You can find a ton of resources in caves :D
[9:56] <Risugami> creepers should be able to bump switches lol
[9:56] <TehButter> Lol no.
[9:56] <funnyguy3D> sumwon you want my save? i found 5 caverns full of resources
[9:56] <TehButter> THE SHEEP KNEW YOUR CODE!
[9:56] <SumWon> lol I'm good, funnyguy3D.
[9:56] <funnyguy3D> like, all around my area
[9:57] <SumWon> I have tons of caverns ;P

[9:58] <SumWon> Oh, well that's why.
[9:58] <SumWon> You haven't explored very much :P
[9:58] <TehButter> I dig down
[9:58] <TehButter> not around :O
[9:58] <SumWon> -_-
[9:58] <SumWon> Don't dig.
[9:58] <TehButter> Wat.
[9:58] <vandelay> DIG DIG DIG
[9:58] <vandelay> DIG AROUND
[9:58] <TehButter> Its minecraft
[9:58] <SumWon> Get a boat, leave your island, and walk around.
[9:58] <Broski> you have two choices mate
[9:58] <vandelay> ~what what~
[9:58] <vandelay> DIG AROUND
[9:58] <TehButter> What.
[9:58] <SumWon> Digging won't get you anywhere lol
[9:58] <TehButter> >:O
[9:58] <Broski> save it and you can direct it to the location (desktop to be easy)
[9:58] <SumWon> You have to find an existing mine.
[9:58] <SumWon> And explore it.

[10:05] <SumWon> Ezral_, cheater ;P
[10:05] <Ezral_> I like to keep it simple
[10:05] <SumWon> It's much cool using a circut such as the one in that diagram

[10:06] <SumWon> lol
[10:06] <SumWon> Need, or want?

[10:30] <Broski> http://prntscr.com/lhqx
[10:30] <gordenfreechmen> it does real fast, risugami
[10:30] <Broski> There is the view from above, XOR behind, inversion infront, then the double gate
[10:30] <gordenfreechmen> it gives you a motive to kill in peaceful!
[10:31] <Risugami> replace with fart sounds

[10:32] <gordenfreechmen> does anybody want to try the stuff

[10:33] <SumWon> oooh, cool
[10:33] <Risugami> guess so
[10:33] <TehButter> Broski:
[10:33] <TehButter> Where do the two lines go?
[10:33] <Broski> First time I've worked with redstone so that was just a big fat learning experience with lady gaga in the background
[10:33] <TehButter> They lead into a wall :P
[10:33] <SumWon> lol
[10:33] <Unrealomega> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgvFIuIvb5o
[10:34] <Broski> If you look closely they turn to switches, just did that temporarily so I could see if they were working...ideally I'll put this mechanism under the gate, then bring the two inputs up on each side of the gate...keep it all hidden away
[10:34] <Dman757> Redstone can be a frustrating at first and even once you understand it its still annoying.
[10:34] <Risugami> if we could manually add redstone to walls and ceiling it'd be better
[10:34] <Broski> Gosh I wish

[10:47] <TehButter> I dont think his lock thing works
[10:47] <ouT|Phaze> I feel like I'm asking too many questions, lol, but what's a good map size? and what's a limit I should avoid?
[10:47] * SumWon shrugs
[10:47] <ouT|Phaze> the tutorials don't really say
[10:47] <SumWon> It was close enough lol
[10:47] <TehButter> http://prntscr.com/lhqx
[10:47] <Cat> ouT|Phaze 128x128x128
[10:47] <TehButter> Okay look at that closely
[10:48] <SumWon> I know, it goes into the wall
[10:48] <ouT|Phaze> so 512x512x512 is too big?
[10:48] <TehButter> Im seeing, when both of them are either on, or off
[10:48] <TehButter> No, no
[10:48] <TehButter> The wall thing is fine
[10:48] <TehButter> But
[10:48] <SumWon> That's the only problem.
[10:48] <Cat> TehButter http://minechan.isgreat.org/m/src/127942099386.png
[10:48] <SumWon> What do you see wrong?
[10:48] <TehButter> When both the levers are on, or both are off
[10:48] <TehButter> The right wall-wire
[10:48] <SumWon> OMG LOL CAT
[10:48] <TehButter> Is off
[10:48] <gordenfreechmen> a metal plate that shocks people when powered would be lol
[10:48] <gordenfreechmen> lol*
[10:48] <SumWon> Yeah, it's a XOR gate.
[10:48] <SumWon> That's how it works
[10:48] <SumWon> lol
[10:48] <TehButter> Yes, well
[10:48] <SumWon> It's not a lock
[10:48] <SumWon> It's so you can have a switch on either side of the door.
[10:49] <Shrub> Switchable cactus
[10:49] <TehButter> Its an opener..
[10:49] <SumWon> He just hasn't moved one to the other side yet
[10:49] <ouT|Phaze> Cat: so 512x512x512 is too big?
[10:49] <TehButter> And it would only open one door
[10:49] <Varriount> Hmm
[10:49] <SumWon> It works. lol.
[10:49] <TehButter> No >:O
[10:49] <TehButter> Look at the right side
[10:49] <TehButter> where the wire runs into the wall
[10:49] <TehButter> follow it down
[10:49] <Cat> <ouT|Phaze> Cat: so 512x512x512 is too big? < No thats ok
[10:49] <SumWon> Yeah

[10:49] <SumWon> They require reverse signals
[10:49] <ouT|Phaze> Cat: awesome, sure is taking forever to generate, though
[10:49] <ouT|Phaze> lol
[10:49] <TehButter> What
[10:49] <SumWon> The flipped one has a flipped signal
[10:49] <ouT|Phaze> but I'm using ZOMG right now
[10:49] <SumWon> Yeah
[10:49] <ouT|Phaze> is Omen faster? or is that normal
[10:49] <TehButter> OHHHHH
[10:49] <TehButter> OH
[10:49] <SumWon> lol
[10:50] <TehButter> I remember now

[10:50] <TehButter> To make double doors
[10:50] <Cat> ouT|Phaze, if ur pc is slow go with a smaller map

[11:17] <TehButter> :D
[11:17] <Shrub> man I love apples
[11:17] <SumWon> Quiet you
[11:17] <TehButter> Anyway
[11:17] <Shrub> I want Notch to implement spring
[11:18] <Pel> dunno ive only ever seen 1 apple
[11:18] <TehButter> In the very first survival modes
[11:18] <TehButter> There was a very rare Notch mob
[11:18] <TehButter> And you could kill Notch
[11:18] <TehButter> to get an apple
[11:18] <Shrub> trololol
[11:18] <TehButter> and make gold apple the same way
[11:18] <Pel> http://trololololololololololo.com/
[11:18] <TehButter> I saw him once,
[11:18] <SumWon> lmao, my dad walked in, saw me playing minecraft and said "Wow. That game looks archaic. "That's one doomed space marine""
[11:18] <TehButter> but he killed me
[11:18] <TehButter> :D
[11:18] <Shrub> XDXDXD
[11:18] <TehButter> XD
[11:18] <Shrub> Your dad rocks SumWon
[11:19] <Shrub> als TehButter
[11:19] <SumWon> lol
[11:19] <Shrub> you shouldn't have messed with Notch
[11:19] <Shrub> he made the world you live in
[11:19] <SumWon> lol
[11:19] <SumWon> Even the real one?
[11:19] <Shrub> Yes.
[11:19] <SumWon> My god.
[11:19] <Shrub> Yes, that's who we're talking about.
[11:19] <SumWon> NOHMYGOD
[11:19] <Shrub> NOTCHMYGOD
[11:19] <SumWon> lmao
[11:20] <SumWon> Heritic.
[11:20] <xjiro> has anyone successfully used cartographer to locate treasure rooms
[11:20] <Shrub> Yes.
[11:20] <SumWon> Nope
[11:20] <xjiro> what do they look like
[11:20] <SumWon> Haven't tried though lol
[11:21] <Shrub> Rooms.
[11:21] <SumWon> Squares I assume?
[11:21] <xjiro> are they square ?
[11:21] <Shrub> Cuboid
[11:21] <xjiro> so you use cave mode right
[11:21] <SumWon> Well on Cartographer they would look like squares...
[11:21] <Pel> you sad people
[11:21] <Pel> sif not discover them yourselves
[11:21] <xjiro> i try
[11:21] <LanternGhost> http://www.darkspore.com
[11:21] <xjiro> i want to see a spawner for once
[11:21] <Pel> i found 2 just by following the horrible noises
[11:21] <LanternGhost> New spore game
[11:21] <LanternGhost> I think so
[11:21] <SumWon> Why?
[11:21] <LanternGhost> Hidden message in the source code
[11:22] <SumWon> Oh really?
[11:22] <LanternGhost> Yar
[11:22] <xjiro> so
[11:22] <xjiro> treasure rooms are always connected to cave systems yes ?
[11:22] <xjiro> are they only beyond a certain depth, etc
[11:22] <LanternGhost> I don't really know xjiro
[11:22] <LanternGhost> I have only found one
[11:22] <LanternGhost> And that was not to far down
[11:22] <xjiro> mythical
[11:22] <Pel> no they are not always connected to a cave system
[11:23] <Pel> i had one 5blocks over sea level
[11:23] <SumWon> Well, there's something encoded in thar.
[11:23] <SumWon> In a bunch of different methods o.O
[11:23] <xjiro> it would be a stunning victory to find anything in game that i located with a cartographer map
[11:23] <xjiro> much less underground
[11:23] <SumWon> LOL AND PI

[11:24] <SumWon> Oh fuck I'm figuring this shit out.
[11:24] <Slam> Gentlemen.
[11:25] <TehButter> An easy way to find one is to look underground for cobblestone you didn't place, or an area where a lot of one mob is coming from.
[11:25] <TehButter> Dungeons on minepedia
[11:25] <furyhunter> SumWon you don't really need pi to that accuracy on a 32-bit system do you?
[11:25] <TehButter> Do you think that would explain that one guy's creeper problem?
[11:25] <Pel> actually the binary message above it is strange
[11:26] <Pel> 
[11:27] <Pel> hrmm
[11:27] <TehButter> Paste the binary
[11:27] <Pel> OMG
[11:27] <Pel> it spells out sam wise like futa
[11:27] <Pel> D:
[11:27] <TehButter> o.o
[11:27] <funnyguy3D> wtf is the darkspore thing
[11:27] <SumWon> TehButter, it's malformed and fuckedupzored

[11:28] <epaGamer> aloha
[11:28] <xjiro> what is the distance between atoms
[11:28] <xjiro> about 1x10^-15
[11:28] <SumWon> xjiro, 2x10^-4200

[11:29] <xjiro> my point is
[11:29] <TehButter> I think i'd rather just tunnel through the ground and find ore that way.
[11:29] <SumWon> Also, hi epaGamer
[11:29] * v is now known as v-is-for-varriount
[11:29] <xjiro> precision up to 15 decimal places implies meters measuring the distance between atoms
[11:29] <SumWon> You'll never get anywhere that way, TehButter lol
[11:29] <xjiro> do you need more digits than that of pi ?
[11:29] <xjiro> no
[11:29] <SumWon> xjiro...wow
[11:29] <SumWon> I understand this.
[11:29] <SumWon> It's a puzzle.
[11:29] <SumWon> Do you have any idea of the context it is in..
[11:29] <SumWon> Did you look at it?
[11:29] <SumWon> DERP DERP
[11:30] <xjiro> derp derp
[11:30] <xjiro> >furyhunter: SumWon you don't really need pi to that accuracy on a 32-bit system do you?

[11:32] <Pel> i think its the grox
[11:32] * Cat is now known as C-is-for-Cancer
[11:32] <SumWon> Mabye there's a limit to relative precision.
[11:32] <xjiro> first of all there is generally a limit dealing with how small real things can get

[11:33] * Varriount is now known as A-is-for-AotC

[11:33] <SumWon> The universe has no limit to precision. :D
[11:33] <xjiro> explain the situation where a constant used needs more than 15 decimal places
[11:33] <SumWon> Each particle is made up of smaller particles
[11:33] <xjiro> it's thought to
[11:34] <SumWon> And smaller particles.

[11:35] <SumWon> I'm pretty sure it's a jpeg lol
[11:35] <xjiro> herp derp infinite precision
[11:35] <SumWon> ikr
[11:35] <SumWon> I'm just being a jackass, xjiro

[11:37] <SumWon> ouT|Phaze, install the JD

[11:37] <SumWon> Add it to your class path :D

[11:38] <SumWon> Nevermind I'm full of shit
[11:38] <ouT|Phaze> lol
[11:38] <SumWon> You do however need to add java to your path variable
[11:38] <ouT|Phaze> and is there a better premade server?
[11:38] <ouT|Phaze> I saw a list of them
[11:38] <SumWon> ouT|Phaze, what OS are you on?
[11:38] <SumWon> are you using*
[11:38] <ouT|Phaze> downloaded fcraft, which is neat, but doesn't load levels that XOMG outputs
[11:38] <ouT|Phaze> I'm on Win7
[11:38] <SumWon> Okay.
[11:38] <SumWon> Click start, right click computer, click properties.
[11:39] <SumWon> Then on the window that pops up, click advanced settings or whatever on the left side bar
[11:39] <ouT|Phaze> k
[11:39] <SumWon> Then click the "Advanced" tab on the window that pops up
[11:39] <ouT|Phaze> k
[11:39] <SumWon> Then click "Environment Variables"
[11:39] <SumWon> Oh, we'll need to find your version of java.
[11:40] <SumWon> So, go to start again, click computer
[11:40] <SumWon> Then go to c:\program files\java
[11:40] <Pel> sumwon
[11:40] <ouT|Phaze> hold on
[11:40] <Pel> want to see the pic?

[11:40] <ouT|Phaze> there isn't an "Environment Variables"
[11:40] <SumWon> There isn't?
[11:40] <Pel> give us a tick uploading to tinypic
[11:40] <ouT|Phaze> under the advanced tab
[11:40] <xjiro> just reinstall java with a windows installer
[11:40] <xjiro> it will solve all your path problems for you
[11:40] <SumWon> Will it xjiro? Didn't know it automatically added java to the path
[11:40] <xjiro> probably
[11:41] <SumWon> ouT|Phaze, do what he said xD
[11:41] <ouT|Phaze> it does, but I've already done this
[11:41] <xjiro> plain jdks are not made for developers
[11:41] <SumWon> Oh you have...
[11:41] <ouT|Phaze> worked fine in my java class
[11:41] <Pel> http://i30.tinypic.com/5orz1h.jpg
[11:41] <SumWon> Well, then it shouldn't be telling you, java is an unrecognized command..
[11:41] <ouT|Phaze> that's why I'm saying something is wrong :|
[11:41] <ouT|Phaze> lol
[11:41] <ouT|Phaze> are there any better prepackaged servers out there?
[11:42] <SumWon> HAH, so I was right, Pel, it was a jpg in base64.
[11:42] <ouT|Phaze> jcraft is neat, and C#, which is exciting
[11:42] * SumWon feels smart.
[11:42] <xjiro> im sure they all require java
[11:42] <ouT|Phaze> *fcraft
[11:42] <ouT|Phaze> not jcraft
[11:42] <Pel> yea it was
[11:42] <Pel> not the best pic tho
[11:42] <SumWon> lol
[11:42] <SumWon> DId you check it's exif data to see if anything is hidden in it?

[11:42] <xjiro> i see
[11:43] <SumWon> How disappointing lol
[11:43] <SumWon> Now there's the last part...why is pi in there...?
[11:44] <ouT|Phaze> I don't mind if it requires java, I'm saying maybe another one will work better. fcraft works fine, but it doesn't support the map type ZOMG outputs
[11:44] <ouT|Phaze> unless I'm missing something about maps
[11:44] <SumWon> What are you trying to use right now ouT|Phaze?
[11:44] <ouT|Phaze> what do you mean?
[11:44] <ouT|Phaze> I'm trying to use the normal minecraft server
[11:44] <ouT|Phaze> from the main website
[11:44] <xjiro> do you understand what you're doing
[11:44] <xjiro> you said you had a java class
[11:45] <ouT|Phaze> it was missing a server.properties, so I wrote one based on what I saw in the tutorial
[11:45] <xjiro> just find java.exe and use the full path for everything from the command line
