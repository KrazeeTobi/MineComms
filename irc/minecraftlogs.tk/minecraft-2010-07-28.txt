[2:18] <Roadcrosser> So I carelessly made a mistake in my Mathematics assignment
[2:19] <Roadcrosser> My grandmother keeps checking my homework without my consent and this was no exception
[2:19] <Roadcrosser> She found the mistake and now she is telling me to write the numbers bigger (I don;t use calclators)
[2:20] <Roadcrosser> Also now she finds a question done CORRECTLY
[2:20] <Willox> Are there any mobs on peaceful?
[2:20] <True|Away> there are neutral mobs (pigs and such)
[2:20] <Willox> Enemy mobs i mean
[2:21] <True|Away> and smaller slimes (but not the big deadly ones)
[2:21] <Willox> So there are spiders?
[2:21] <True|Away> spiders are not neutral
[2:21] <Willox> I think they used to be?
[2:21] <Willox> i read something like that
[2:21] <Roadcrosser> She takes it and compares it with some other almost related question I got wrong. She told me the same question just now
[2:21] <Roadcrosser> Big blobs of slimes used to be in peaceful
[2:22] <Willox> I never played on peacful, but i feel like making something good and not being afraid of the dark :c
[2:22] <True|Away> spiders have never been on peaceful, but big slimes used to be.
[2:23] <Willox> Yeah, i usually play on normal
[2:23] <True|Away> the only things that show up on peaceful now are pigs/cows/sheep/smallslimes

[3:58] <Chelmo> does anyone ever get this feeling that you're gonna walk through a door in your house/castle/whatever and see a creeper staring at you with those awful eyes? something like silence of the lambs.
[3:58] <Siiseli> and destroy the grid by, say, picking up bombs and throwing them
[3:58] <Siiseli> and other staff like that
[3:58] <Milesaru> Notch i have a question, ive just graduated from a Games Design course and awaiting funding for a games projecti have on the go, got 4 coders and 5 designers. Any tips for a fellow starting games company?
[3:58] <asie[rlyafk]> and if they don't i use a self-implanted exploit in the game to crash all servers
[3:58] <TheCactusman> Blizzard will buy it and charge $25 a month.
[3:58] <visiON> Shit, I need Fog of War
[3:58] <visiON> How to code fog of war?
[3:58] <Cat> Siiseli sleef kinda?

[3:58] <Chelmo> lol
[3:58] <Notch> Milesaru: Well, yes. Make a game.
[3:59] <Siiseli> Milesaru, properly set up your version control. Seriously, do it
[3:59] <JabJabJab> But hey Notch, I have some ideas for some machinimas, and I want to use you in some of them, be it voice, or just some really funny, but awesome scripts im comming up with for some upcomming machinimas, so are you interested in that?

[3:59] <LG_Legacy> Cows everywhere.
[3:59] <Quatroking> so it sounds like you're being innovative
[3:59] <Milesaru> we are, we've got a prototype almost done, Im just wondering about pitfalls that people over look when starting companies

[4:50] <Kizzycocoa> drawing? :S
[4:50] <Nibbsy> Notch you should make a class based team deathmatch style thingo
[4:50] <Cial> i do wonder about the slime balls :/
[4:50] <ez> ok, it was koko then!
[4:50] <NullAshton> Okay, you know how dynamic water is not infinite anymore?
[4:50] <Nibbsy> in minecraft
[4:50] <Kizzycocoa> I don't know. I don't draw much
[4:50] <Kizzycocoa> if at all
[4:50] <Pilk> Yes
[4:50] <Plinky> Slime balls are basically the current curiousity.
[4:50] <ez> then I remember correctly, thought I might have mixed you two up
[4:50] <Plinky> SPA does not agree with the killing of small slimes too!
[4:50] <Kizzycocoa> Plinky, no, it's books :P
[4:51] <Plinky> Kizzycocoa: Slime balls have no use
[4:51] <Plinky> Books have a use.
[4:51] <Kizzycocoa> nope
[4:51] <NullAshton> If water(or lava) flows down an incline, how many tiles does each level have to be?
[4:51] <Kizzycocoa> no use
[4:51] <ez> I want a way to move blocks with redstone dust!
[4:51] <Darkfire002> 5.
[4:51] <Plinky> Kizzy, you make book shelves with them.
[4:51] <vede> "Slime Protection Agency" -> "SPA" -> slime spa; what slimes SHOULD be used for, ya damn hippies
[4:51] <Kizzycocoa> and they have no use
[4:51] <Kizzycocoa> :P
[4:51] <Cial> i want to be able to put redstone dust up a wall
[4:51] <ez> book shleves are pwetty
[4:51] <Darkfire002> as do i.
[4:51] <Pilk> Oh I see what you are saying, I'm not sure though. Do a test
[4:52] <Plinky> In a way, bricks have no use too then Kizzy
[4:52] <Cial> bricks are ugle
[4:52] <Twangy> Very strong though
[4:52] <Snowman> ez, you had one in SMP :3
[4:52] <Cial> *ugly
[4:52] <Snowman> I made you one
[4:52] <Kizzycocoa> they do. as a building material
[4:52] <Twangy> Griffer resistant
[4:52] <Kizzycocoa> a strong one
[4:52] <Snowman> I sailed across half the map to get enough papyrus
[4:52] <Snowman> Almost got lost
[4:52] <Nibbsy> you're all racist against slime-kind
[4:52] <Plinky> So are bookshelves.

[4:53] <asie[really-afk]> Brett - a 2D sandbox
[4:53] <Plinky> SLIME!
[4:53] <asie[really-afk]> with physics
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> my friend described it as (minecraft - 1 dimension) * GMOD-like physics props
[4:54] <Brett> ah, one of those sand games?
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> no
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> not at all
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> it's not one of those sand games
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> it's like a 2D platfomer-ish Minecraft
[4:54] <Shrub74> You'd think everybody would've moved away from Midsomer by now.
[4:54] <Cat> http://fragmer.net/minechan/m/src/12800591517.png
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> with props that you can shoot at people
[4:54] <Plinky> Brett, do you know what a sandbox is?
[4:54] <Plinky> :P
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> or stack them into cubes
[4:54] <Brett> Plinky: yes
[4:54] <Nibbsy> off the top of your head, what is the worst game you have ever played?
[4:54] <Nibbsy> anyone
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> Nibbsy: Can't recall one
[4:54] <Brett> minus a dimension, though, i was just curious as to how you'd go about creating one
[4:54] <Shrub74> E.T.
[4:54] <asie[really-afk]> I only played 9-ish games in my life

[4:55] <Nibbsy> :O!
[4:55] <asie[really-afk]> so, yes
[4:55] <Kizzycocoa> wow. notch is on, and we have about 275 people
[4:55] <Shrub> Actually
[4:55] <asie[really-afk]> #asiepits is the channel for it
[4:55] <Brett> asie: of that i am aware
[4:55] <Nibbsy> I've been playing games since i was about 3 or 4
[4:55] <Kizzycocoa> that's a record I think
[4:55] <Shrub> 3D-1D would just be 2
[4:55] <Nibbsy> because I have no life
[4:55] <Demki> asie, how is your game going along?
[4:55] <Shrub> if you actually DID algebra >.>
[4:55] <Plinky> Nibbsy, I can't name one right now.
[4:55] <KingSam> Notch, I found a glitch with snow and stair blocks
[4:55] <Nibbsy> and was obsessed with SMB
[4:55] <asie[really-afk]> Demki - it's planned, i'm working on the devkit
[4:55] <KingSam> snow falling on stair blocks = snow overhang
[4:55] <LG_Legacy> Cat god damn blocks
[4:55] <asie[really-afk]> it'll probably be both online and standalone from the get-go
[4:55] <asie[really-afk]> as in
[4:55] <Brett> asie: what language?
[4:55] <Nibbsy> my most hated game ever
[4:55] <asie[really-afk]> Brett - C#
[4:55] <asie[really-afk]> as I know it the best
[4:55] <Nibbsy> syphon filter omega strain
[4:56] <Nibbsy> it pissed me off so much
[4:56] <Shrub> you guys didn't even acknowledge my witty pun :(
[4:56] <Shrub> fuck you
[4:56] <asie[really-afk]> C#/Silverlight for the online version, C#/.NET or Mono for standalone
[4:56] <Shrub> Syphon Filter rocked
[4:56] <Nibbsy> It doesn't explain what to do
[4:56] <asie[really-afk]> (there's Silverlight for Linux (Moonlight) so don't worry)
[4:56] <Plinky> Actually, mine is probably mario paint :P

[4:57] <asie[really-afk]> Brett - so it is cross-platform-compatible, yes
[4:57] <asie[really-afk]> and if your OS doesn't support Silverlight
[4:57] <asie[really-afk]> chances are it supports Mono
[4:57] <asie[really-afk]> so you can still run it
[4:57] <Cat> Cat blocks?

[5:03] <ez> nice song Shrub
[5:03] <Shrub> It is
[5:03] <Brett> mmm trent reznor <3
[5:03] <Cial> Johnny Cash
[5:03] <Shrub> I love Johnny Cash's version
[5:03] <Brett> i'd tap that
[5:03] <Brett> it's good, but it lacks the raw passion of the original
[5:03] <Shrub> but it can't beat the original, :(
[5:03] <ez> yeh johhny cash does it good
[5:03] <phil> original > jc
[5:03] <Shrub> But the original is always better, it's a cold hard fact :/
[5:03] <Cial> ive never heard the original
[5:03] <Shrub> neither
[5:04] <Brett> cash's is good, but it approaches the song from a different angle and with a different background
[5:04] <Shrub> i think I might go listen
[5:04] <AcidMan> Eddie Van Halen is the best guitarist ever
[5:04] <AcidMan> :D
[5:04] <Shrub> and the riff is so haunting
[5:04] <phil> perfect song when played live

[5:40] <CyborgDragon> -.-
[5:40] <CyborgDragon> wait where's catalonia?
[5:40] <muddtusk> Good.
[5:40] <Shrub> Spain >.>
[5:40] <muddtusk> Spain-ish.
[5:40] <Shrub> Spain.
[5:41] <PetiePal> Well they kill the bull at the end don't they lol
[5:41] <CyborgDragon> also, most bullfighting is humane, because they use tranq-tipped spears
[5:41] <PetiePal> After stabbing him with those spear things like 50x
[5:41] <Shrub> Bullfighting is a rich part of their culture!
[5:41] <CyborgDragon> those spears are tranq-tipped
[5:41] <Shrub> That's more important than life!
[5:41] <muddtusk> I'm pretty sure they are still torturing an animal to death for sport.
[5:41] <CyborgDragon> meaning the bulls feel no pain
[5:41] <Shrub> No
[5:41] <PetiePal> Well maybe they're have to find something else to have fun with
[5:41] <Shrub> You know
[5:41] <PetiePal> Like if we took Nascar away from rednecks
[5:41] <Shrub> sometimes the matador loses
[5:41] <CyborgDragon> mudd, im all for animal rights and stuff
[5:41] <Shrub> and the bull lives
[5:41] <PetiePal> Lol well
[5:42] <PetiePal> It should be a cage match
[5:42] <CyborgDragon> but bullfighting is something i dont really care for, as they kill it humanely
[5:42] <PetiePal> no little rodeo clowns to get them away

[5:42] <Shrub> I love bullfighting :(
[5:42] <Shrub> It's one of the greatest sports of all time
[5:42] <Shrub> How could they...
[5:42] <Shrub> Now I'm pissed at all animal rights activists.
[5:42] <muddtusk> Animals have no rights.
[5:42] <PetiePal> And what are you? I'm a cow!
[5:43] <PetiePal> YOU'RE A BASEBALL GLOVE GET ON THE TRUCK!
[5:43] <Shrub> lol
[5:43] <CyborgDragon> mddtask, they have the right to a painless death at the very least
[5:43] <PetiePal> And wha are you? I'm a seal!
[5:43] <Shrub> that'd be so awesome to say to a cow
[5:43] <PetiePal> I sit on my flippers and do cute little human things!
[5:43] <PetiePal> You're free to go.
[5:43] <Shrub> yay seals :D
[5:43] <Shrub> I love seals
[5:43] <Shrub> they're so cute
[5:43] <muddtusk> No. Animals all over the planet die painful deaths.

[5:43] <PetiePal> I like manatees too
[5:43] <Shrub> The ones NOT in captivity die worse deaths than ones that die in sport :(
[5:43] <PetiePal> Cows of the sea lol
[5:44] <Shrub> We're -helping- them
[5:44] <PetiePal> I used to see them in Fl all the time when I was fishing
[5:44] <Kokopure> wait wait
[5:44] <muddtusk> Right, but that doesn't mean we are doing them a favor when we make them fight a human and bleed out.
[5:44] <Kokopure> which animals die in sport?
[5:44] <Shrub> Bulls
[5:44] <Kokopure> ...
[5:44] * Deiz (swh@69-196-147-109.dsl.teksavvy.com) has joined #minecraft
[5:44] <CyborgDragon> regardless muddtask, they do have rights, those rights just differ from human rights
[5:44] <Kokopure> Bulls don't die in the wild from predators.
[5:44] <Kokopure> bulls are farm animals.
[5:44] <Shrub> We are the Stalin of animals!
[5:44] <muddtusk> Where do their rights come from?
[5:44] <Kokopure> if we didn't kill them, they'd lay around fucking al day.
[5:44] <Shrub> Koko nobody said anything about predators
[5:44] <Kokopure> dude, where do our rights come from
[5:44] <PetiePal> Yeah that's depriving them of a lot of buillsex

[5:45] <Shrub> That would be awesome
[5:45] <muddtusk> You read a lot, Kokopure?
[5:45] <CyborgDragon> damn, koko ninja'd me
[5:45] <muddtusk> West Civ lit wise?
[5:45] <Shrub> Animal Farm?
[5:45] <Kokopure> muddtusk, I read some stuff.
[5:45] <Kokopure> I have read Animal Farm
[5:45] <Shrub> Animal Farm sucked
[5:45] <muddtusk> Animal Farm isnt really west civ lit
[5:45] <CyborgDragon> wtf is with people talking about animal farm all of a sudden
[5:45] <CyborgDragon> just yesterday 5 people mentioned it
[5:46] <CyborgDragon> and now more are talking about it
[5:46] <Shrub> Because it's a shitty book
[5:46] <Shrub> not really it's a classic
[5:46] <PetiePal> I didn't like animal farm
[5:46] <Shrub> but I couldn't get into it
[5:46] <PetiePal> Or the Great Gatsby
[5:46] <Shrub> fuck you
[5:46] <muddtusk> GG was badass
[5:46] <TheCactusman> http://fragmer.net/minechan/m/src/127917496881.jpg

[5:46] <Shrub> and 1984 is my 3rd favourite Dystopian Novel :D
[5:46] <muddtusk> Because it is witty, well written and meaningful today
[5:46] <PetiePal> It's like 1930s Lindsay Lohan
[5:46] <PetiePal> What are your top 3?
[5:46] <Shrub> 1) Fahrenheit 451
[5:46] <CyborgDragon> my top 3?
[5:47] <Shrub> 2) Brave New World
[5:47] <CyborgDragon> uhh....let's see
[5:47] * NullAshton now has a kickass waterfall entrance to his house.
[5:47] <PetiePal> Ahhh I liked Farenheit
[5:47] <Kokopure> I actually haven't read 1984 or Fahrenheit
[5:47] <Shrub> Fahrenheit 451 was the most badass book I ever read
[5:47] <PetiePal> It was pretty awesome

[5:48] <Shrub> I fucking loved that
[5:48] <Kokopure> I have read To Kill a Mockingbird and Of Mice and Men

[5:49] <Kokopure> but I did read them in HS
[5:49] <PetiePal> and the other one Flowers for Algernon lol
[5:49] <PetiePal> that was sad
[5:49] <Shrub> Flowers for Algernon...
[5:49] <Shrub> don't mention that to me
[5:49] <PetiePal> lol
[5:49] <Kokopure> oh oh
[5:49] <PetiePal> that was a good story
[5:49] <Kokopure> I loved The Importance of Being Earnest
[5:49] <Shrub> I used to read that to my girlfriend as she slept ;-;
[5:49] <muddtusk> Wylde?
[5:49] <CyborgDragon> to kill a mockingbird
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> that's just one fucked up story

[5:50] <NullAshton> Infinite water blocks. You pick it up with a bucket, and it doesn't vanihs.
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> kizzy, he idles in irc
[5:50] <Stenlay> i lost my glasses the today i bought new one, they only cost 25?? haha
[5:50] <Kizzycocoa> I mean, he's just there. :\/
[5:50] <CyborgDragon> nullashton, it's known
[5:50] <PetiePal> Oh you crazy Brits!
[5:51] <muddtusk> Null, I've seen that done. Not with a single source block, though.
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> if a space is bordering two other springs, then it will turn into a spring
[5:51] <CyborgDragon> this only applies to water
[5:51] <Kizzycocoa> I guess. :P but it's sorta odd. you expect chaos, and he stops it by not being here, which makes people wonder what happened to him :P
[5:51] <muddtusk> Did it ever work with lava?
[5:51] <NullAshton> I kinda wish it did. kinda.

[5:54] <CyborgDragon> building, not tools
[5:54] <Slam> but if you build with it you dont mine it.
[5:54] <Shrub> v.v;;
[5:54] <Shrub> you mine it
[5:54] <Slam> you use lava and water to create
[5:54] <Shrub> so you CAN build with it
[5:54] <Slam> on the spot
[5:54] <CyborgDragon> -.-
[5:54] <TheCactusman> What?
[5:54] <Shrub> what if you don't have lava or water with you?
[5:54] <Shrub> what if you find it underground?
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> slam, why waste lava when there's already obsidian there?
[5:55] <Slam> then i hope you enjoy speniding like 30 seconds mining it
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> i'd take the obsidian there first before wasting any lava
[5:55] <Slam> wait guys
[5:55] <Slam> ill upload an image.
[5:55] <Shrub> 15*
[5:55] <TheCactusman> What is it cat?
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> also, bricks are the second strongest mineable material
[5:55] <Shrub> Epic
[5:55] <NullAshton> Also obsidian still takes a ridiculous amount of time to mine.
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> taking 5 seconds with every pick
[5:55] <NullAshton> huh. Really?
[5:55] <CyborgDragon> furnaces 3, taking 4 seconds with every pick
[5:55] <PetiePal> Time to make an obsidian pick

[6:56] <Shrub74> I remember this one time this chick asked me out, and I said no, 3 years later she got married into my family v.v;;
[6:56] <Diablodoct0r> Though, maturity comes generally with age
[6:57] <TheCactusman> Not always.
[6:57] <Diablodoct0r> Very few 14 year olds are as mature as 19-year olds
[6:57] <killer2329> ^^lies and slander
[6:57] <Lisimba> I'm old enough that I don't have to pretend to be mature.
[6:57] <Viral> i'd have to respectfully disagree with that.
[6:57] <Diablodoct0r> And one or two "special people" won't make that difference

[7:25] <ColdFusion> [quote] Quatroking, trying to keep Multiplayer to himself like a Jew and continuing to want to feel important, demanded Notch to shut down the server. Notch responded with a simple "lol no" and kept the server up, even releasing the invite code on his Twitter. Quatroking then tried to cause drama by blaming the code leak on World of Minecraft and Brocraft, then eventually the blame spread to /v/.[/quote]

[7:34] <Diablodoct0r> Bet you didn't know that
[7:34] <gdude2002|work> Quatroking: Good point

[7:34] <gdude2002|work> Diablodoct0r: I did know that >.>
[7:34] <PetiePal> I don't know how they can determine that either, since there's not clear medical records of Da Vinci lol
[7:34] <Vic> actually it wasn't aspergers
[7:34] <Vic> it was something close to it
[7:34] <JamesK89> Well with dyslexia its easy to get confused and do mental math since digits become swaped, etc..
[7:34] <Diablodoct0r> Orly vic?

[8:10] <visiON> Yeah
[8:10] <visiON> but
[8:10] <visiON> how do you mine
[8:10] <visiON> when you carry torch
[8:11] <visiON> oh nvm
[8:11] <Koko|busy> ability to carry lit torches would be nice, but I think it'd be laggy.
[8:11] <Outpost> You plant it down and pull out a pick.
[8:11] <race122> good point

[8:11] <cnr> You guys lag at night->day?
[8:11] <visiON> i mean not PC laggy
[8:11] <visiON> but the change of light
[8:12] <visiON> its not smooth

[8:12] <visiON> its like.. light on 1st block..........................light on 2nd block...... etc
[8:12] <Koko|busy> it might be cool, but, I'm just saying it could cause performance issues, potentially.

[8:12] <cnr> hi Notch
[8:13] <Shadaez> it really wouldn't
[8:13] <ChJees> I am eating Icecream
[8:13] <ChJees> It is delicious
[8:13] <ChJees> Fact of the day
[8:13] <Shadaez> it would be the equiv. of adding a torch and removing a torch, every step, to the light layer
[8:13] <Evil-Ville> if you just make the torch update every 0.2 seconds or so it wouldn't be any more resource intensive than placing new torches
[8:13] <Outpost> I'm sure there's a way to work around performance loss. I know things like L4D and HL2 have the held-torch light client only.
[8:13] * ahref (ahref@82.45.98.130) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[8:13] <Shadaez> Outpost that's completely different
[8:13] <Outpost> So MP-wise it wouldn't be an issue.
[8:14] <Milp_main> My trees dont fully vanish after i fell them, why?
[8:14] <NullAshton> Well.
[8:14] <Outpost> The other thing they do is the older ones they're not 'true light'
[8:14] <visiON> Magic
[8:14] <Outpost> It's just a gamma projection on the screen.
[8:14] <Quatroking> Milp_main, just throw in some fire
[8:14] <visiON> Or magic
[8:14] <Outpost> But that only works for flashlights, and not torches.
[8:14] <NullAshton> Everyone else still sees flashlights, but they're relatively cheap sprite cones I believe.
[8:14] <Milp_main> meh no time for that D:
[8:14] <Evil-Ville> if the leaf blocks touch anything that isn't a leaf block they won't vanish
[8:14] <ChJees> Server Light + Client light
[8:14] <ChJees> Herp
[8:15] <visiON> only client light
[8:15] <visiON> else it WOULD get laggy
[8:15] <NullAshton> Well from what I've read, the episode 2 flashlight isn't actual light either.
[8:15] <visiON> Give client coords of torches and such. client renders light

[8:15] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.6.150) Quit (Quit: Quitting)
[8:15] <Outpost> Not actual light, so no real calculations would have to be done.
[8:15] <visiON> but thats not real
[8:16] <visiON> refer to http://xkcd.com/772/
[8:16] <Outpost> It doens't matter if it's not real, it works.
[8:16] <visiON> Minecraft needs more realistic
[8:16] <Outpost> Eat food every hour, OR YOU DIE.
[8:16] <NullAshton> If I recall, Episode 2 uses some sort of projected texture thing.

[8:17] <Evil-Ville> i mean i know everyone here has autism but come on
[8:17] <NullAshton> It is probably muchsimpler for the server to simply tell the client where lights are.
[8:17] <visiON> Koko|busy: server sends light sources to client, client renders
[8:17] <Outpost> koko: That gets REALLY laggy if you have multiplayer. It's why stuff like that was cut out of L4D
[8:17] <NullAshton> This is all of course moot as players CANNOT PRODUCE LIGHT.

[8:19] <Kizzycocoa> I made a massive one. it has each mob seperated

[8:44] <Lantris> Say if they only have 60 copies of one game and 85 people pre order it
[8:44] <Glendening> minecraft fortress?
[8:44] <Dragoon> THE SECOND SLIME FELL IN THE FUCKING POND NEXT TO MY BASE AND DIED
[8:44] <Dragoon> HRRRRRRRRRNGH
[8:44] <Lantris> They would give out the 60 copies tot he first 60 people
[8:44] <Koko|busy> hrm
[8:44] <Skorchy> Dragoon, trying to capture one?
[8:44] <Koko|busy> I think Minecraft on the DS could work.
[8:44] <TheCactusman> Nope.
[8:44] <muddtusk> :|

[8:45] <Lantris> I don't see it working
[8:45] <Koko|busy> and the shoulder buttons could be the respective mouse clicks.
[8:45] <TheCactusman> The DS could not run it due to Graphical capabilities.

[8:46] <TheCactusman> But now that Nintendo DS R4 cards are illegal, you can't use them for Homebrew stuff like Minecraft DS.
[8:46] <RocketSquid> Definately would be neat to see. Touchscreen could be an always open inventory slot
[8:46] <muddtusk> Does the 3DS have BA hardware?
[8:46] <Lantris> Controls would be meh
[8:46] <Lantris> And it would lag after some time inless he limited size
[8:46] <Koko|busy> ... I meant like, if Notch actually wanted to port Minecraft to the DS someday.

[8:47] <Dragoon> Yes, Skorchy, I am.
[8:47] <Lantris> To much pirating.
[8:47] <Koko|busy> Lantris, he wouldn't really need to do a deal with Nintendo O_o

[8:47] <Demki> Skorchy, then why do they swarm at me?
[8:47] <Koko|busy> Lantris, I guess that's true.
[8:47] <Skorchy> I've only found 1-2 slimes ever. Poor lil' buggers.
[8:48] <Koko|busy> Skorchy, you killed them?
[8:48] <muddtusk> Is DS piracy off the charts right now?
[8:48] <Lantris> I guess I just don't like the idea of it being on the DS.
[8:48] <NullAshton> Cows.
[8:48] <Koko|busy> I made papercraft slimes :D
[8:48] <NullAshton> They are evil.
[8:48] <Lantris> Yes.

[8:48] <Koko|busy> actually
[8:48] <Koko|busy> I was thinking
[8:48] <Demki> don't forget to put led inside them.
[8:48] <Shadaez> I bought Heartgold
[8:48] <muddtusk> Sales of the hand-held device or the games, Shadaez?

[9:00] <Tommy_> prob
[9:00] <ouT|Dead> star trek has it done right

[9:00] <Diablodoct0r> Democracy has proven the best form.
[9:00] <Tesla> yeah Diablodoct0r, I know. That's why it doesnt work :P If they managed to make some sort of incentive, itd be great

[9:04] <Tesla> Diablodoct0r, i dunno, if I could do literally anything, I can imagine a whole lot of plus and a large dearth of minus
[9:04] <Tesla> :S
[9:04] <Diablodoct0r> Well,
[9:04] <Tesla> :D
[9:04] <Diablodoct0r> Let's say this was paradise
[9:04] <Diablodoct0r> Everything = perfect
[9:04] <Diablodoct0r> Constant orgasm, constant taste of ice cream and all you like
[9:04] <muddtusk> End Scene
[9:04] <Diablodoct0r> Perfect temperature..
[9:05] <Tesla> This is what I could do if I could do anything
[9:05] <NMLittle> Sounds rather boring
[9:05] <Diablodoct0r> There would be Nothing new to explore.
[9:05] <Tesla> 1) Create a universe
[9:05] <Tommy_> yes
[9:05] <Diablodoct0r> You'd be so passive, life would be shit.
[9:05] <Evil-Ville> or you could end this horrible discussion
[9:05] <Tommy_> percisly
[9:05] <Tesla> 2) Create a dyson sphere that somehow works constantly
[9:05] <C418> yeah I never want to be rich

[9:05] <gear> fuck that
[9:05] <muddtusk> I'm down w/ the D sphere
[9:05] <gear> i definately want to be rich
[9:05] <Diablodoct0r> Without differences, without negative things, there are no positive.
[9:05] <Tesla> 3) Seed the sphere with all kinds of civilizations throughout history, and incredible nature
[9:05] <Diablodoct0r> There is only one state
[9:05] <C418> I rather live a life where I can get enough to live happily
[9:05] <C418> in a nice job
[9:05] <Diablodoct0r> ^
[9:05] <Tesla> 4) Pass like, 50 million years in an instant, so that the civs randomize and create culture
[9:06] <gear> thats not to say i wouldnt be happy living with enough
[9:06] <buttcrabs> Diablo thats... difficult to think about
[9:06] <Tesla> 5) Have religion actually WORK for the people there
[9:06] <gear> but if i somehow had tons of money
[9:06] <Tommy_> so true
[9:06] <Diablodoct0r> I'd say, the perfect is the imperfect.
[9:06] <gear> awesome
[9:06] <buttcrabs> do you think people would be unhappy
[9:06] <buttcrabs> well the question is
[9:06] <Outpost> If I could do anything, I'd make RL become an RPG and force people to grind boring repetative tasks for money.
[9:06] <C418> you'd change your way of living
[9:06] <Lantris> I wouldn't care to be rich but if I had a job that I knew would allow me to live a good life and allow me to buy things I wanted such as a new computer I would be fine.
[9:06] <C418> definitely
[9:06] <Tesla> 6) Be born into that sphere as a child with no memories, and live in the awesomeness as many times as i like

[9:06] <buttcrabs> It's too odd a scenario because we need to look at our minds being happy in terms of evolution as well

[9:07] <Chezhead> Anyone want to join us for minecast? We really need people
[9:07] <gear> or expensive cars
[9:07] <buttcrabs> but I don't think we would neccesarily be unhappy if everything was perfect
[9:07] <Diablodoct0r> Chezhead: People to do what exactly
[9:07] <Diablodoct0r> ?
[9:07] <C418> I wouldn't know what to talk about
[9:07] <gear> id probably outfit myself with a nice small place
[9:07] <Chezhead> C418, we would talk about SMP mainly
[9:07] <Tesla> in summary, if i could do anything, i would just leave and make my own universe with different laws and just dick around
[9:07] <Tommy_> yeah,
[9:07] <C418> that I'm not interested in
[9:07] <Tommy_> oh woops
[9:08] <Chezhead> I would write up a topic sheet going through the topics
[9:08] <Chezhead> Then you don't have to join in
[9:08] <Chezhead> Anyone else?
[9:08] <buttcrabs> Sorry mod
[9:08] <RocketSquid> I totally would Chezhead if I wasn't stuck at work

[9:08] <Thunder11> C418, i have an idea for SMP, could you by any chance get it to notch?
[9:08] <Diablodoct0r> Tell me what you want us to do
[9:08] <Tesla> guys, im gonna go enjoy the imperfect capitalistic world

[9:08] <Chezhead> what, Diablo
[9:08] <vede> "Everything being perfect" would basically be a scenario in which there is enough of that "bad stuff" to allow the "good stuff" to outweigh it vastly enough to be the primary focus of any given person while still being able to exist. There's bad parts but there's little enough that it's barely noticeable but enough to keep the good parts working.

[9:14] <vede> Diablodoct0r, so since you're so "WE NEED PEOPLE TO SUFFER SO PEOPLE CAN BE HAPPY" what's your stance on things like, say, stopping war or giving food to starving people?
[9:14] <RocketSquid> I was thinking carniverous plants
[9:15] <Koko|busy> I think slime trails...
[9:15] <Drakkar> in fact
[9:15] <Koko|busy> should act like snow

[9:15] <Drakkar> would mess with me

[9:15] <buttcrabs> RocketSquid I like that
[9:15] <Evil-Ville> vede that's just subsidized suffering

[9:15] <buttcrabs> We already suffer
[9:15] <Diablodoct0r> Without poor people, we would never have these cheap computers
[9:15] <TheCactusman> I want miniture blocks in Minecraft, and tables you can place them on. We should have miniture model things we can place on blocks.
[9:15] <buttcrabs> we would just suffer more
[9:15] <Kizzycocoa> slime trails, like snow. thin, and slidy. slimes would create them. good idea? :P

[9:21] <Koko|busy> if you're fine with not being "wealthy"

[9:21] <Koko|busy> it's possible
[9:21] <Koko|busy> unfortunately, that is not the world we live in
[9:21] <vede> Couldn't we base our current happiness on suffering that we know occurred in the past? All of humanity could be happy at the same time because they know that the current situation is very good in comparison to the things that happened before.

[9:23] <Koko|busy> but right now we don't have that technology.
[9:23] <vede> The planet isn't "meant" to do jack shit. It's just a bunch of crap that we use as well as we can. The number of people the world can sustain is dependent upon how well we can use all the stuff it's made of.
[9:23] <Koko|busy> right now we have the technology that we do have.
[9:23] <Snowman> Protip: don't read books in the kitchen
[9:23] <Koko|busy> and that technology cannot sustain 10 billion.

[9:24] <Snowman> The Earth is just a supercomputer
[9:24] <Koko|busy> cash that is surplus
[9:24] <Outpost> Or war.
[9:24] <Diablodoct0r> yeah

[9:24] <Koko|busy> either way, money

[9:30] <Drakkar> doesn't need it though
[9:30] <Tommy_> that makes a ton of sense

[9:30] <Diablodoct0r> hmm
[9:30] <Diablodoct0r> I might just..
[9:30] <Diablodoct0r> Get it
[9:30] <Drakkar> its singleplayer
[9:30] <Diablodoct0r> Cause I wanna know what POstal 2 is like
[9:30] <Diablodoct0r> yeah

[9:46] <ZarroTsu> Notch is it just the one server up at the moment? Max 20 players?
[9:46] <Koko|busy> Notch, yellow snow exists o.o?
[9:46] <KingSam> ah, I see :L
[9:46] <GreenHoopla> Is the stability better, Notch?
[9:46] <Notch> yeah, just one
[9:46] <Notch> stability was good last time
[9:46] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Notch
[9:46] <Snowman> Notch, why didn't you make it private again?
[9:46] <Notch> and I think I've fixed the two biggest bugs now
[9:46] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Can you put up another server?
[9:46] <Diablodoct0r> back
[9:46] <Diablodoct0r> Hi Notch
[9:46] <GreenHoopla> That's good :)
[9:46] <CyanRyan> "FruktBorg", "SomeShell", "GravelManhattan"
[9:46] <Overv> Notch, have you seen the e-mail I've sent about an Android MineCraft client?

[9:46] <ZarroTsu> Actually I'd wonder if multiserver random choice would even work
[9:46] <Overv> Ah
[9:46] <asiekierka> overv - call it "craftr"
[9:46] <ZarroTsu> probably not
[9:46] <Dragoon> Slimes are more transparent now
[9:46] <Notch> but you can make a game clone that's almost the same if you want, that's just cool. =)
[9:46] <asiekierka> that's a name for my clone of minecraft i never used
[9:47] <Overv> But I can not make it connect to Minecraft servers?
[9:47] <ClassiestMedic> @Mystify89 either form is fine, but I muuch prefer short one-liners that can trigger my imagination. Two word ones are best, like "lava pig"
[9:47] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> Notch how many people are in the server?
[9:47] <Notch> Diablodoct0r: Laziness..
[9:47] <ClassiestMedic> Discuss
[9:47] <Snowman> Notch, why didn't you make it private again?
[9:47] <Notch> FlyingOvenOfDoom: 20.

[9:47] <AcidMan> Dammit , server has to be full :(
[9:47] <Cat> !blog
[9:47] <Sr_creeper> Notch, i have to ask you, how can you have the patience to keep going on this, i couldnt even dream of doing something like this.
[9:47] <Notch> bigger won't help much. ;)
[9:47] <asiekierka> if you see any connections from 78.88.180.66, that's me trying to get in
[9:47] <GreenHoopla> Hah.
[9:47] <Snowman> How is this better? Random people who probably won't give feedback
[9:47] <Snowman> And who will probably grief
[9:47] <Stenlay> Notch, is it possible that any players can host servers?
[9:47] <KingSam> Notch, it will help
[9:48] <Notch> it's FUN, Sr_creeper
[9:48] <KingSam> since more people = more people going in and out
[9:48] <Koko|busy> you should let C418 make a second server. he'd love it.
[9:48] <ClassiestMedic> Stenlay
[9:48] <Sr_creeper> Understandable.
[9:48] <TheCactusman> It will help stress testing Notch if you make it a higher player limit.
[9:48] <C418> ...what?
[9:48] <Koko|busy> :3
[9:48] <ClassiestMedic> He needs to do more debugging
[9:48] <Notch> the client is hardcoded to just join the one server
[9:48] <C418> I'm not making a second server
[9:48] <asiekierka> "LaserManhattan"
[9:48] <ClassiestMedic> befre he hands out the software
[9:48] <Stenlay> ok
[9:48] <NullAshton> I assume Notch is also getting quite a bit of money from sales. I helped!

[9:48] <Koko|busy> for what~?
[9:48] <asiekierka> Notch - can I use a two-word combination made by your password generator for a name of my game?
[9:48] <ClassiestMedic> Notch deserves any money he gets!
[9:48] <Notch> sure

[9:49] <GreenHoopla> Ah, Fruit. That's odd :P
[9:49] <ZarroTsu> @Cold : slimes look different, apperantly (I'm assuming transparency), and there is SMP progress
[9:49] <destroyerx1> are you gonna put the survival server up?
[9:49] <Stenlay> yeah

[9:55] <Marcos> Notch i pmed you a thing
[9:55] <RocketSquid> New slimes look creepy
[9:55] <Dragoon> Yep
[9:55] <C418> I could try an autokick with "notch,"
[9:55] <Zaneo> This is why we can't have nice things
[9:55] <Genemos> shush, just shush :P
[9:55] <Helar1> Do furnaces work in SMP?
[9:55] <C418> just for giggles and shitting
[9:55] <SireTRM> New slimes aren't as cute :((((
[9:55] <Genemos> C418 please do
[9:55] <asiekierka> Notch - and "OICU812!"?
[9:55] <Iguana> But they look better
[9:55] <Evil-Ville> do it C418
[9:55] <tssguy123> lol
[9:55] <Diablodoct0r> I dislike the new slimes D:
[9:55] <Cheeseyx> No,tch, are you going to add a left hand slot for things like shields and carryable lanterns?
[9:55] <Snowman> C418, put one on Minecraft as well
[9:55] <asiekierka> ALSO WHY DID NOTCH REMOVE colon
[9:55] <Skorchy> Diablo, whats the biggest cave you've ever been in?
[9:55] <Krysonian> www.livestream.com/krysonian
[9:55] <Krysonian> Streaming SMP!
[9:55] <C418> now that would be amusingly destructive

[9:55] <C418> well
[9:56] <Dragoon> Hey hcton, will we be able to add custom soundpacks sometime during beta?
[9:56] <C418> the slimes look more like slimes
[9:56] <GreenHoopla> I just got NotchLord
[9:56] <Diablodoct0r> Several kilometers long
[9:56] <Skorchy> Currently on my 247th torch

[9:56] <Dragoon> I like the solid slimes more
[9:56] <Sr_creeper> "YellowBorg"
[9:56] <Diablodoct0r> I cant livestream without lag
[9:56] <Syncaidius> heh i survived about 1min on the SMP server before i got bugged >.>
[9:56] <Skorchy> Cheesey
[9:56] <asiekierka> i'll count how much it takes me to connect
[9:56] <Evil-Ville> is there a picture of the new slimes somewhere
[9:56] <Dragoon> What's all the random words for?
[9:56] <RocketSquid> I agree, C418. Old slimes looked like pets and less like mobs
[9:56] <Firetempest> I think the slimes outer shell needs to be more translucent
[9:56] <C418> ...the smp server is still running?
[9:56] <Kokopure> Evil-Ville, one was just posted

[9:56] <Marcos> Notch?
[9:56] <Kizzycocoa> there should be a queue system with MP. would be nicer :\/
[9:57] <Skorchy> Remember when I led TC5?
[9:57] <asiekierka> Ugh

[9:57] <asiekierka> My counter says

[9:57] <asiekierka> that it takes me 3.7 seconds per SMP attempt
[9:57] <Kokopure> the Hot Hot Tamale song desyncs after a little while.
[9:57] <Skorchy> Do you know how many times I said STFU in that challenge, cheesey?
[9:57] <FlyingOvenOfDoom> NotchSoup... sounds delicious
[9:57] <Snowman> That's one of the big problems of it being public, it's like it's being DDoS non-stop
[9:57] <Evil-Ville> they look pretty good to me

[9:58] <KingSam> lolwut
[9:58] <TheCactusman> D: cactussoup is bad D:
[9:58] <Kokopure> is this a password generator?
[9:58] <asiekierka> Notch - is it OK that I run an attempt to connect SMP every 4 seconds (counted with a timer) or should I slow down
[9:58] <Diablodoct0r> If a server is properly set up, you can deal with an extreme amount of DDoS without problem
[9:58] <Diablodoct0r> Just make your server drop any client connection that isn't active

[11:02] <Fiskie> Siiseli: it's useless
[11:02] <Snowman> Autojoin is just asking for a ban in every channel
[11:02] <Siiseli> Fiskie, how so
[11:02] <Snowman> If someone kicks you, it's for a reason
[11:02] <Siiseli> indeed
[11:02] <Siiseli> it's kick evading
[11:02] <sgtpepper> snowman is righ
[11:02] <gdude2002> A kick is a kick though
[11:02] <gdude2002> not a bna
[11:02] <sgtpepper> right*
[11:02] <gdude2002> ban*
[11:02] <Fiskie> Lol
[11:02] <NullAshton> Kick evading wha
[11:02] <Fiskie> "Kick evading"
[11:02] <Siiseli> gdude2002, but autojoin is really just kick evading
[11:02] <gdude2002> Imo, a kick evade is not getting kicked in the first place
[11:02] <Fiskie> Lol wut
[11:02] <Snowman> Autojoin makes it like you're not even kicked

[11:02] <gdude2002> So?
[11:02] <X440> Gdudes right
[11:02] <Fiskie> Kick evading would be doing /part before getting kicked

[11:05] <Fiskie> In the channels I moderate I only kick for fun
[11:05] <Siiseli> anyway, kick evading is when you completely(or nearly) nullify the effects of a kick with autojoin. You deserve to have to do that awful horrible extra work of typing /join #minecraft.
[11:05] <LG_Legacy> gdude2002 Cause Siiseli has control over the channel with ez, and we can't say shit or else he will say he has more fucking authority.
[11:05] <NullAshton> Man.
[11:05] <gdude2002> I suppose.
[11:05] <NullAshton> Having to type for two whole seconds.

[11:07] <muddtusk> hai
[11:07] <Siiseli> well anyway, I honestly don't think it's that absurd. When someone's kicked it basically means "fuck off for a small while"
[11:07] <Aeomin> ^
[11:07] <gdude2002> Siiseli: In the real world, it lasts for about 1s anyways
[11:07] <Zaneo> hmm so we need clients that let us specify how long before reconnect
[11:07] <sgtpepper> which fiskie needs
[11:07] <Dragoon> I wish small slimes could get in boats
[11:08] <Fiskie> Siiseli: gg. Autojoin bans are now considered useless
[11:08] <NullAshton> No, that's what a temporary kickban does.

[11:16] <Compo> What's everyone up to?
[11:16] <rcfighter> When entered, it should check your username, and if it matches a list, the server kicks a random non-trusted user from the SMP server so you can join
[11:16] <Marcos> Testing kelraider
[11:16] <rcfighter> So the original testers can get in
[11:16] <TrueWolves> or it could just go 10 trusted slots, 10 public slots, 2 private slots (Notch/ez X3)
[11:16] <rcfighter> That would work too.
[11:16] <NullAshton> rcfighter: I really hate that system. I like private slots better.
[11:16] <Fiskie> http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/27/worms-reloaded-beta-going-worldwide-on-monday/
[11:16] <Fiskie> yayyyyyy
[11:17] <Nahob> hey chaps
[11:17] <TrueWolves> and it warns you if your taking a trusted slot as a public user that you may be kicked when a trusted user gets on.
[11:17] <Nahob> why is IRC dying? :(

[11:19] <Darktooth> :D
[11:19] <Fiskie> xjiro: lold
[11:19] <NullAshton> pardon for ruining the dreams. But slimes are made out of liquid. How does a leash attach to it?
[11:19] <Darktooth> ;~;
[11:19] <Darktooth> Well!
[11:19] <rcfighter> Let me guess, you want to- Ah, Null brings up my point.
[11:19] <Fiskie> I remember when Quatro demanded to take the SMP server down because he wouldn't get in otherwise
[11:19] <commandhat> NullAshton, how do slimes not fall apart?
[11:19] <Zaneo> Non-newtonian fluid?
[11:19] <rcfighter> Oobleck.
[11:19] <NullAshton> They're liquid.
[11:19] <Zerim> Do you, Fiskie?
[11:19] <Darktooth> We will put the slimes in a freezer!
[11:20] <Darktooth> Problem solved.
[11:20] <Fiskie> Zerim: what
[11:20] <NullAshton> But that would kill them.

[11:25] <cryzed> Notch, why is it only possible on a Mac to easily exchange the textures by placing them next to the Minecraft.app? Can't you implement that for the Linux and Windows version aswell? There you would place them next to the launcher.

[11:25] <xjiro> does notch use a mac
[11:25] <Darktooth> There should be an easier way to install textures.

[15:59] <doomkid> you sure i can ram the boat into that and it wont bust?
[15:59] <TrueWolves> I'm not 100% sure
[15:59] <Dragoon> Who's advertising here?
[15:59] * Mattie2009 (mattie@5ac2077a.bb.sky.com) has joined #minecraft
[15:59] * Firetempest (Mibbit@adsl-235-21-186.clt.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[15:59] <WateryHell> Nope, Notch took the server down
[15:59] <TrueWolves> but I know it used to be a bug.
[15:59] <Neoboy80> I don't see it on the rules list on the minecraft site
[15:59] <sgtpepper> thank you
[15:59] <_Sata_> how do i lower the chunks being updated?
[15:59] <blaster> * TrueWolves kicks you from #minecraft (advertisment)
[15:59] <TrueWolves> There's a few rules we have now not on the list, the rules need to be updated.
[15:59] <blaster> Advertising is not against the rules
[15:59] <Neoboy80> Yes they do
[15:59] <_Sata_> I mean, no matter if it's near or far
[15:59] <doomkid> i will be going fast i have some rapids made all down hill but the darn boat keeps busting
[15:59] <blaster> or at least not advertising other irc channels
[15:59] <WateryHell> I mean, it's somewhat related to Minecraft
[16:00] <_Sata_> it's always 100-200 chunks being updated here
[16:00] <sgtpepper> truewolves it is a unspoken rule :D
[16:00] <sgtpepper> an*
[16:00] <blaster> Also, if you are making up a temporary rule, at least announce it before you begin banning people for it
[16:00] <Mattie2009> ...what.
[16:00] <sgtpepper> blaster
[16:00] <sgtpepper> shush <.<
[16:00] <Neoboy80> It's probably not temporaray
[16:00] <Neoboy80> temporary*
[16:00] <Dragoon> Man what. Who's advertising/
[16:00] <Dragoon> ?*
[16:00] <WateryHell> blaster?
[16:00] <blaster> I was advertising a seperate irc channel
[16:00] <sgtpepper> correcct
[16:00] <sgtpepper> correct*
[16:01] <blaster> Or, more redirecting people to it for a contest
[16:01] <Firetempest> I need a Firebat to purge my mines of slimes.
[16:01] <blaster> which began here
[16:01] <Shadox> lrn2read scrollback >_>
[16:01] <WateryHell> He was advertising a irc channel for a contest
[16:01] <Neoboy80> true
[16:01] <doomkid> if galss still hurts the boat i think a rubber block would be nice to have use it for roads and such
[16:01] <WateryHell> That's related to minecraft skins
[16:01] <Firetempest> rubber roads.....
[16:01] <WateryHell> It's not ENTIRELY advertising

[16:03] <WateryHell> He heard it was good, I think
[16:03] <Firetempest> because SCII is cool
[16:03] <Mattie2009> SC2 is good
[16:03] <Dragoon> ...
[16:03] <Neoboy80> Notch heard about SC2, and it was good
[16:03] <Mattie2009> I'm actually cob
[16:03] <Siiseli> Dragoon, uh, to play it?

[16:04] <Kodaichi> Minecraft and TF2 happen to be the 2 games I play most often
[16:04] <Kodaichi> but I don't like payload maps :/
[16:04] <Kodaichi> I mostly do surfing
[16:04] <WateryHell> Minecraft map for TF2 = AWESOME OF EPIC PROPORTIONS
[16:05] <Mattie2009> Also one of the main characters is a Jamaican smuggler rogue ghost
[16:05] <Firetempest> The funniest damn thing ive seen yet is in the armory and two spider mines get into a slapfight
[16:05] <Mattie2009> I still don't get it
[16:05] <Risugami> I would play more TF2 but since I have about 4 seconds of lag. FPS MP and me don't get along
[16:05] <Skorchy> gj notch, putting in yellow letters "sexy". Proud ofim.
[16:05] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[16:05] <Genemos> ClassistMedic, I have bought it, and I don't regret it, all my friends got MW2= I got it. Now all my friends got SC2+ notch, and I am kinda thinking about getting it aswell. I did regret paying for MW2 a lot though, it is a broken game.

[16:06] <Kodaichi> TF2 is expensive man, like 500 million bucks
[16:06] * Kodaichi lies and it's probably like 20 bucks
[16:06] <Neoboy80> It's $20
[16:06] <Neoboy80> Maybe less
[16:06] <Lantris> ^
[16:06] <Conundrumer> I can't find any other cannon that's better than mine, ignoring simplicity

[16:21] <FlamingTROUT> Okay.

[16:21] <slowriot> and you need mossy cobble to craft them

[16:56] <So_Useless> Zeph, the purpose of chat rooms is to have a bunch of insecure people try and prove they are the smartest ones in the room. Additionally, you win the chat if you can halt conversation somehow.
[16:56] <Risugami> rules are for fools
[16:56] <Zerim> Fools are for rules

[17:24] <Animator> Hey citricsquid.
[17:24] <Quatroking> hahahaha
[17:24] <So_Useless> Minecraft isn't even in beta, yet, and there is a chance it will be on steam.

[17:25] <citricsquid> in september I told you all to fuck yourself in more words and then left, I think. I forget, but I was a dick.

[17:25] <citricsquid> we discussed it loads in here back in june/july last year

[17:26] <midtown123> And Minecraft: Source is next to impossible.
[17:26] <Animator> I wonder how that dude will react to the possibility of Notch turning down said offer.
[17:26] <whaleboobs> Big jo
[17:26] <Darke> So_Useless, that would be so inefficient
[17:26] <Truce> MINECRAFT: DM
[17:26] <Cosmic_Fool> for a second I thoughht it said only 150 people
[17:26] <Darke> It's not even funny
[17:26] <Kyto> source is one of the crappiest engines ever
[17:26] <Cosmic_Fool> I was excited
[17:26] <Neoboy80> Minecraft: source? No.
[17:26] <Kyto> it's beautiful but bugged
[17:26] <Animator> The most awesome thing is him inviting Notch to work for Valve.
[17:26] <yoshibot> midtown123, every game doesnt need to be in source to be on steam
[17:26] <midtown123> Source handles entities different so having that many entities would cause ridiculous amounts of cpu usage and lag.

[17:26] <citricsquid> Valve do that
[17:26] <citricsquid> buy out dev teams
[17:26] <Kokopure> Notch is invited to Valve?
[17:26] <Neoboy80> Minecraft infdev + source engine = Reliable snapshot overflow every 3 seconds

[17:27] <Kokopure> o_o?
[17:27] <Flot> "HURR DURR MINECRAFT =/TF2"

[17:27] <Quatroking> I did, I'm just finished with a nice session of nuclear holocaust
[17:27] <joo> Hello?
[17:28] <citricsquid> SPECULATION.
[17:28] <Quatroking> there's this fallout 3 mod I downloaded today, Cube Experiments
[17:28] <Kokopure> I think that after Notch finishes Minecraft, he might be okay with that
[17:28] <joo> Will minecraft be linux compatible?
[17:28] <Quatroking> worst level designers ever but its pretty cool and reminds me of Aperture Science
[17:28] <JamesK89> Playing Minecraft on Linux as we speak
[17:28] <citricsquid> joo: runs on java, any system that supports java
[17:28] <Quatroking> joo, its java
[17:28] <joo> Oh right, thanks
[17:28] <midtown123> make ajax version, die from lasg
[17:28] <Quatroking> technically you can even run it on your tomtom
[17:28] <Flot> Notch always wanted Minecraft on Steam... I hope I wouldn't have to make a new account if it does eventually get onto it.
[17:28] <joo> I'mma buy it soon then

[17:29] <yoshibot> Quatroking, actually not on your Tomtom. It doesn't have accelerated 3D last I checked
[17:29] <midtown123> hopefull we won't have to buy it again once it gets onto steam, assuming it does
[17:29] <Rooster> I need a stubborn analogy.
[17:29] <whaleboobs> Java sux
[17:29] <citricsquid> Quatroking: don't you remember when we discussed it like, last july?
[17:29] <Quatroking> yoshibot, meh
[17:29] <Rooster> An analogy about stubborness
[17:29] <yoshibot> any desktop system with 3D acceleration can play Minecraft
[17:29] <Darke> Scrippy, chunks are 15x15xmap height?
[17:29] <Flot> He said it'd be neat to have Minecraft on steam, like... months ago.
[17:29] <Scrippy> Yes Darke.
[17:29] <Quatroking> citricsquid, well, yeah, but that was about payment methods

[17:30] <Scrippy> It'd be cool if there were multiple layers of chunks, vertically
[17:30] <Risugami> minecraft loves eating RAM
[17:30] <Quatroking> didn't Notch throw away the steam idea after figuring out steam marketing and DRM sucks dick?
[17:30] <So_Useless> To whom it may concnern: For eons, now, our chunks have been generated in strictly a horizontal manner. We are tires of this abherrant practice! We demand change! We shall not sit by and allow this flagrant abuse of our civil liberties to continue!
[17:30] <Darke> Scrippy,
[17:30] <Darke> why
[17:30] <Scrippy> That allow players to explore cavernous depths and build high into the sky.
[17:30] <Darke> (oops)
[17:30] <JamesK89> I'm ok with Steam and I trust Valve
[17:30] <yoshibot> just that it would run AT ALL
[17:30] <yoshibot> i had a laptop that chugged through Minecraft at 15FPS with fog at the closest setting
[17:30] <So_Useless> I think that should be fleshy enough.
[17:30] <joo> I can't get the classic web version to run, i assume i must be missing something?
[17:30] <Kyto> Quatroking: never heard of Steam DRM
[17:30] <Rooster> I just realized something.
[17:30] * Quatroking facepalm
[17:30] <Scrippy> Because 128 blocks above ground is so limiting.
[17:30] <JamesK89> However I despise Activision and Ubisoft
[17:30] <Darke> Scrippy, doubling the height would half the FPS
[17:30] <Rooster> Minecraft is like a political debate.

[17:31] <Zerim> Keep your text to one line, guys. We have too many people on right now, so it's hard to follow conversations.
[17:31] <Furyhunter> steam drm is basically you have an account and your game licenses are associated with it
[17:31] <Scrippy> And only rendering chunks you've explored?
[17:31] <Kyto> wow
[17:31] <Darke> However higher you make it the laggier and larger amount of RAM it requires
[17:31] <noq> anyone know what time it is where notch lives? and what time we usualy gets online
[17:31] <Flot> Notch said steam was nice as recent as a stream this month, I believe.
[17:31] <JamesK89> FPS could be improved if there were a super-chunk... like an Octree type structure
[17:31] <Scrippy> Okay
[17:31] <yoshibot> i'm sure notch could figure a way to migrate Minecraft accounts to Minecraft-on-Steam licenses
[17:31] <Flot> And Steam is hardly DRM.
[17:31] <Kyto> you got minecraft account and your game is associated with it
[17:31] <whaleboobs> The time here is 3:30
[17:31] <whaleboobs> 2:30 *
[17:31] <Furyhunter> to access your games on a fresh install, you log in to the steam client, and it downloads the game files
[17:31] <Quatroking> oh god
[17:31] <Scrippy> So say there is only one 15x15x256 chunk loaded.
[17:31] <Quatroking> oh god oh god oh god
[17:31] <Zerim> what?
[17:31] <Quatroking> move it awayyyyy
[17:32] <yoshibot> Darke: the same mechanism that limits your view horizontally should work vertically too
[17:32] <Darke> Scrippy, it wont happen
[17:32] <Furyhunter> the binaries are typically tainted in a fashion where they're either encrypted or merely depend on steam running
[17:32] <Darke> Notch already said it
[17:32] <WateryHell> What?
[17:32] * Quatroking is reading the TF2 forums
[17:32] <AzureAngelic> lol
[17:32] <Quatroking> this is even worse than
[17:32] <WateryHell> Oh.
[17:32] <Flot> You're late Quatro
[17:32] <Zerim> What is happening!?
[17:32] <Scrippy> When was that?
[17:32] <JamesK89> Its 16x16
[17:32] <Flot> They're terrible huh
[17:32] <Rooster> Liberals are content to keep the game open and conservatives are pressed to keep the game "in theme"
[17:32] <AzureAngelic> trust me
[17:32] <yoshibot> so it wont rape your FPS so hard
[17:32] <AzureAngelic> ignore the tf2 forums
[17:32] <Darke> yoshibot, except chunks are only 16x16 horizontally
[17:32] <Furyhunter> the newest iteration of steam drm encrypts the binaries and requires that the steam servers send a decryption key
[17:32] <midtown123> /me is lul
[17:32] <AzureAngelic> it's like a cesspool
[17:32] <Quatroking> even worse than playing a shooter on a console
[17:32] <Rooster> Oh yeah, Steam talk.
[17:32] <Furyhunter> offline mode works by storing this key for a period of time
[17:32] <Scrippy> Look
[17:32] <Animator> Rooster, I already did that analogy back when Dock was in town.
[17:32] <Darke> It would just be WAY To complicated to make them vertical
[17:32] <Scrippy> Theortically
[17:32] <Darke> And it isnt happening
[17:32] <Quatroking> this is even worse than wiiware
[17:32] <Rooster> pFFFF

[17:35] <AzureAngelic> they held a contest where everyone submitted content
[17:35] <Flot> Polycount contest was held last month, people would submit custom weapon models to be integrated into TF2
[17:35] <yoshibot> so you guys can add whatever things you want
[17:35] <AzureAngelic> the winners get put in the game

[17:48] <Zerim> WoM
[17:48] <Jacob_> Dozens of players with minimal lag
[17:48] <Scrippy> Soap operas are higher FPS than conventional television and movies.
[17:48] <Scrippy> That's why they look fake
[17:48] <Flot> We can already host dozens of players with minimal lag
[17:48] <Flot> Silly
[17:48] <Jacob_> On an infinite map?
[17:48] <Scrippy> This just in: Everything you know about television is wrong.

[17:48] <Flot> Soap operas.
[17:49] <citricsquid> I built a hosting system for minecraft servers, gotta wait for SMP to be released to see how it holds up. The resource usage of SMP isn't too bad though, about 40MB RAM per player and only 2/3% of CPU according to Notch.
[17:49] <Scrippy> But it's true.

[18:41] <Rooster> Theres a difference between not liking a game and calling people fanboys Zerim.
[18:41] <BurgaRaven> someone tell me how to portforward for minecraft
[18:41] <Risugami> rip out the extra modes, free PC mods
[18:41] <TrueWolves> and a game-kill glitch if you use the mapsystem while climbing the outer wall.
[18:42] <Zerim> Rooster, they are just trolls and should be ignored anyway
[18:42] <Rooster> Whatever
[18:42] <TrueWolves> and you don't have to be the game for the boss rush, which reveals the secret final boss.
[18:42] <Rooster> Not getting in a stupid argument.

[18:48] <Krysonian> Okay you guys, listen up.
[18:48] <Scrippy> I mean
[18:48] <Keiya> Zaneo: Yeah, it's still Source.
[18:48] <Scrippy> In similar styles
[18:48] <Cheeseyx> Got TF2 started up
[18:48] <Azu> it's like.... moving two dimensionally across the face of a cube and being able to freely switch to the others? idkd
[18:48] <Krysonian> I'm interviewing Notch tomorrow morning and I need two more questions.
[18:48] <Azu> -d
[18:48] <Scrippy> With good gameplay.
[18:48] <Keiya> The engine versions deviate, but yeah
[18:48] <Krysonian> I was going to chalk these ones up to the community.
[18:48] <Scrippy> I'm a sucker for pixelly art.
[18:48] <WateryHell> Interview?

[18:48] <Scrippy> And music.

[18:51] <Krysonian> It's official, it's scheduled for 9 AM EST tomorrow.
[18:51] <bleak> Krysonian: Ask him what he thinks about redstone and coal being used as a sort of flux for steel and magic steel, or something
[18:51] <nupanick> I was bummed when I first played pokemon third gen
[18:51] <Krysonian> It's going to be posted on www.iChan.org for sure.
[18:51] <xjiro> bleak: herp derp suggestions in the forms of questions
[18:51] <Risugami> 9AM? ugh
[18:52] <bleak> xjiro I JUST WANNA KNOW OK
[18:52] <Rooster> Krysonian: Ask him what his next step is after SMP has been released, what direction of updates he'd like to implement most of all.
[18:52] <nupanick> in the first two pokemon games, things were so pixelly that you could imagine the trainer looking however you wanted
[18:52] <xjiro> SUGGESTION NOT QUESTION OK
[18:52] <bleak> no not ok
[18:52] <nupanick> and of course I imagined him looking like me
[18:52] <Rooster> And I'd stay away from suggestion questions
[18:52] <nupanick> in third gen the trainer was much more detailed
[18:52] <nupanick> and looked stupid
[18:52] <Risugami> "When will we get TF2 hats?"
[18:52] <nupanick> I couldn't identify with him anymore without the big pixels
[18:52] <Rooster> You usually get an answer of "Ya that sounds great" and that's it.
[18:52] <Krysonian> Risugami: He probably has no word about that as of now.
[18:52] <Scrippy> Ask him how he will expand on the current crafting system.
[18:52] <Risugami> :P
[18:52] <xjiro> Krysonian: i'd like to know if he's taken any statistics on piracy, and any related observations. i have a suspicion that minecraft has a ridiculous pirate-to-sale conversion rate
[18:53] <Scrippy> Also the obliatory question about hats.
[18:53] <Scrippy> Of course.
[18:53] <Philol> Ask about BOATS PLX
[18:53] <Risugami> how bout those powered minecarts
[18:53] <Krysonian> Boats? MineCarts? What about?
[18:53] <RyMan> Krysonian: Ask him about LAN play and if it will require more than one copy of Minecraft.
[18:53] <Risugami> when?
[18:53] <Cheeseyx> Krysonian, if you do chose to ask abotu the stealth system, can you tell me first?
[18:53] <nupanick> fez and miegakure: more like Duke Nukem 4Dimensional amirite
[18:53] <Philol> scrippy : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO7cVIk8CmY
[18:53] <Cheeseyx> I have a few examples of what the stealth system could be like
[18:54] <Krysonian> Cheesyx: I'll just post the interview, you can see it when everyone else does.
[18:54] <Zaneo> It's a fair price, and a relatively small community compared to larger games, i really don't see any need pirate...

[18:55] <Cheeseyx> Runescape is free for limited features, and so is minecraft

[18:55] <TrueWolves|Sick> Becuase people are fucking retarded.
[18:55] <TrueWolves|Sick> Enough said.
[18:55] <Cheeseyx> But if you want to buy one, minecraft costs less than three months of runescape membership
[18:55] <Flot> Also, good news; Valve is trying to get in direct contact with Notch to discuss something.
[18:55] <RyMan> I bought it because I'm terribly happy with even the current features lol
[18:55] <Zaneo> It's hard to explain the game and how fun it is. You really do have to play it yourself
[18:55] <nupanick> Meh, I don't much mind

[18:56] <nupanick> I love crafting
[18:56] <Flot> Minecraft will be fine on steam, it's just a standard content distribution service. Not DRM. Not a burden. Not even remotely annoying actually.

[18:57] <Cheeseyx> If it got on steam, we would have to get our purchases of minecraft ported to steam
[18:57] <Cheeseyx> So we can get the achievements
[18:57] <Risugami> still need to buy L4D but I doubt it'd run on my pos pc
[18:57] <Flot> Well, yeah.

[18:58] <Ted> Awsooooooome
[18:58] <Flot> You would buy the game on Steam, which would then ask you to make an account; Steam would automatically validate it. If you already have an account, I'm sure they'll find a way to get that into steam, much like the CD-key thing they did back in 2004.
[18:58] <dickweed> Okey guys. I'll try to keep this short, I would like if someone could share their Minecraft account with me for a while so I could download Minecraft Alpha to TRY it. Because I like things fair (Even though life isn't), and because Minecraft is some sort of an indie game and not controlled by some huge corporation, I think it would be "ok" if I could TRY..
[18:58] <dickweed> ..Minecraft before actually buying it.

[18:59] <dickweed> ...
[18:59] <WateryHell> dick, there's a browser-based version of Minecraft that's free
[18:59] <Risugami> which btw have about 20% of the features current game has
[18:59] <dickweed> Sorry for my name, it was the first thing to come to my mind.. for some reason.
[18:59] <Cheeseyx> Survivaltest is better than no alpha at all
[18:59] <Flot> Yeah. Survival test/creative will effectively tell you if you want the game or not; Alpha is basically a version in survival test with a shitton more features and immersion.
[18:59] <Flot> version of*
[18:59] <Cheeseyx> Yeah

[19:00] <wolf_alex> rooster couldnt that be hacked like
[19:00] <wolf_alex> easyily
[19:00] <noq> that would be too easy to crack
[19:00] <Rooster> :/
[19:01] <Deages> has notch said anything in here about bandwidth usage for the server?
[19:01] <Rooster> How about updated /survivaltest
[19:01] <Deages> >_>
[19:01] <dickweed> I have in fact thought about sending an email to Notch about some sort of "try for free" thing but I have also come to the conclusion that that would made pirating the game too easy.
[19:01] <Cheeseyx> When it was infdev not alpha most current, the newest version of the game was still technically not a mode, just a peek at the new features
[19:01] <wolf_alex> deages not bandwidth but ram useage
[19:01] <EmpiresBane> you can't crack a trial if it doesn't have the full game
[19:01] <Flot> But Dick, you CAN try it for free.

[19:02] <GreenHoopla> bandwidth is more important
[19:02] <Deages> well. would 40GB of bandwidth be enough for a 24 slot server?
[19:02] <Flot> The Minecraft release out of beta might take a very long time. It took nearly a year to get from the start of development to near-beta, which is where we are now.
[19:02] <Deages> the other offer is 75GB
[19:02] <wolf_alex> rooster indeed, thats why when I run I use vanila
[19:02] <Cheeseyx> Sweet, I got on the TF2 server

[19:03] <Flot> dickweed, it's only a small sum of money. You should be able to tell from the bit of the game you've played already whether you want it or not.

[19:24] <Fisheatsbear> he put it on his blog
[19:24] <Lightbourne> So is the problem lag or you literally can't play?
[19:24] <RyMan> nemesis: just uploading it there won't host it
[19:24] <LinuxPoser> literally cant play
[19:24] <noq> its not the same post
[19:24] <nemesis> sweet are there any system specs
[19:24] <LinuxPoser> it tells me drivers are too old
[19:24] <Lightbourne> yeah but Facepunch is talking about it going on steam which could be cool
[19:24] <nemesis> like how much memory and bandwidth this would use?
[19:24] <noq> he posted about the video not the article
[19:24] <Lightbourne> anyone have a link to the article?

[19:25] <RyMan> nemesis: no problem
[19:25] <Lightbourne> Nope
[19:25] <RyMan> Furyhunter: Why is that a problem?
[19:25] <Furyhunter> there's no JNI binding for the steamworks API
[19:25] <Fisheatsbear> notch is in for a big surprise
[19:25] <Furyhunter> notch'd have to make one himself
[19:25] <LinuxPoser> looks like im cursed to never play :\

[19:26] <LinuxPoser> who wants to link me to the linux i should have

[20:01] <FM4k> Hey all - question: Why is the discussion of "guns" such a "no-no" topic?
[20:01] <Risugami> you know, I think I noticed that too
[20:01] <Scrippy> Steve jobs is a goddamn nut.
[20:02] <Scrippy> Because Notch wants to keep things fantasy oriented.
[20:02] <DBN> not sure if they're disabled or it's other factors like snow
[20:02] <FM4k> But who says guns, to some inception, aren't fantasy?
[20:02] <Scrippy> I could see cannons maybe.
[20:02] <FM4k> Right :)
[20:02] <wolf_alex> oh god

[20:02] <wolf_alex> just a toy!
[20:02] <Scrippy> Guns I don't think he's allowing because of balance.
[20:03] <wolf_alex> ask this prson
[20:03] <Scrippy> Since it would imply massive damage and long range.

[20:04] <Brotagonist> It's liek gold.
[20:04] <Scrippy> Cannons I could see.
[20:04] <FM4k> Personally, I feel like Notch broke the rule by giving skeletons a projectile.
[20:04] <Brotagonist> Hard to obtain, perfectly useless.
[20:04] <Scrippy> Muskets are useless unless you're firing into a crowd.
[20:04] <Scrippy> Well we have arrows too.
[20:04] <FM4k> Yea, but we run out.
[20:04] <Risugami> cannons at least are hard to move
[20:04] <Scrippy> The range is limited though, that's the point of them.
[20:04] <FM4k> And we have to aim.
[20:04] <Brotagonist> Arrows are our pistol and muskets would eb the shotgun of minecraft.
[20:04] <Scrippy> And skeletons have shitty aim.
[20:04] <GARY_M_9> We should have Crossbows
[20:04] <FM4k> Have you tried to survive a pit of skeletons in closed quarters? lol
[20:04] <Scrippy> They can't predict motion paths.
[20:04] <WateryHell> yea
[20:05] <Scrippy> Have you tried to survive a pit of anything in close quarters?
[20:05] <GARY_M_9> or we should get more accuracy on the bow
[20:05] <FM4k> I have - skeletons give me trouble :P
[20:05] <Scrippy> If you get surrounded you're pretty much screwed.
[20:05] <Risugami> pigs? yes
[20:05] <GARY_M_9> because it doesn't aim right
[20:05] <WateryHell> creepers...
[20:05] <Brotagonist> Also, Maybe it's just really hard to code bullets and how they move/react/make other things react
[20:05] <FM4k> Creepers sucks... but its possible to survive if you have enough bacon ;)
[20:05] <wolfx> Im happy with TNT, although proper cannons would be awesome
[20:05] <Scrippy> Yes wolfx
[20:05] <Scrippy> Awesome indeed
[20:05] <Scrippy> Creepers aren't that bad for me
[20:05] <FM4k> Brotagonist - it's easier to code a bullet than it is to code an arrow with an arches tragectory :P
[20:05] <Scrippy> Just hack at em'
[20:05] <Brotagonist> If I fall into a pitch black pit and hear TWANG TWANG i immediately turn it to peacful.

[20:12] <Dommys> I say FFA :3

[20:12] <FM4k> Scrippy: That's kind of fucked... I'm paying money to get my shit jacked?
[20:12] <Dommys> Designation is lame.
[20:12] <Scrippy> Hey, FM4k
[20:12] <Dommys> Paying money?
[20:12] <bleak> Can you stake your own claims
[20:12] <Zerim> If you're running a MC server with 1 gig of ram, you haz problems
[20:13] <wolfx> (coins) Which would be craftable? Because they shouldn't be, that's like counterfeiting right?
[20:13] <Scrippy> Notch is giving us options.
[20:13] <Scrippy> Traps.
[20:13] <Scrippy> Concealed walls.
[20:13] <Risugami> *paid* money

[20:13] <nemesis> how do you run multiple servers?
[20:13] <Scrippy> Your shit will be perfectly safe if trap and hide it right.
[20:13] <Brotagonist> Yay it worked.
[20:13] <benjgvps> I hope the server doesn't use too much CPU, I run a small 8 person source server and a minecraft server on my 1.8 GHz P4 box with 768 MB of RAM :/
[20:13] <FM4k> shouldn't all of us assholes get together and decide what we want as a majority?
[20:13] <Risugami> you're paying money to work in a kitchen? heh

[20:14] <UWBW> We need trapdoors

[20:15] <Scrippy> He's going to be the final decider.
[20:15] <FM4k> Not when it's for sale.
[20:15] <Risugami> really, #1 thing we want for redstone, is trapdoors
[20:15] <wolfx> Exactly
[20:15] <UWBW> Damn straight
[20:15] <Scrippy> This has been said many times.
[20:15] <FM4k> That's the problem.
[20:15] <Scrippy> Yes, when it's for sale.
[20:15] <UWBW> It's Notch's game, not the communities
[20:15] <UWBW> '
[20:15] <Scrippy> He's not a publicly traded company
[20:15] <Brotagonist> :9
[20:15] <Brotagonist> I bought it.
[20:15] <SmokestormX> Ever see that episode of red dwarf with the justice field, if he tried to set something on fire instead he catches fire.. yea you need a justice field.. griefers on fire
[20:15] <Risugami> drops what is standing on it, and allows water passage
[20:15] <Scrippy> He can do whatever the shit he wants to his product
[20:15] <nemesis> how to run multiple servers on one pc!?!?!
[20:15] <Scrippy> And there is nothing we can do about it.
[20:15] <FM4k> That's all well and good

[20:16] <benjgvps> We don't own stock, though I did buy the game 5 times :)
[20:16] <Scrippy> Maybe even suggest a few
[20:16] <bleak> Scrippy I'm tantalized by the idea of having to keep your property under lock and key
[20:16] <Scrippy> http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=1c111&t=1c111.40&f=1c111.6c55a
[20:16] <FM4k> Scrippy: But that's the problem, isn't it? You're stance is that what we say doesnt matter.
[20:16] <Scrippy> Here's mine
[20:16] <bleak> Wild Westcraft
[20:16] <Scrippy> It's not that it doesn't matter
[20:16] <Brotagonist> SO did Notch get the message that I'd give mine 100$ to implement intelligent gravity for nearly all blocks by this fridays update.
[20:16] <Zerim> If we the community don't like anything in the game, Notch will change it. If he doesn't, then it's gonna hurt him more than us.
[20:16] <Scrippy> We can tell notch what we want
[20:16] <Scrippy> And he's smart, he will probably implement a lot of it.
[20:17] <wolfx> He could, tomorrow, make every texture look like sponge, and we could change it, but it would still be up to him
[20:17] * ClassiestMedic (Kevjohnson@12.197.57.185) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[20:17] <Scrippy> But all in all it is his game and if there's something he doesn't want he won't add it.
[20:17] <Scrippy> Like we could get a million people voting for goddamn space ships
[20:17] <FM4k> Scrippy: If the majority of community agreed on a feature and demanded it, notch would comply within 2 weeks. I'll bet you anything.
[20:17] <wolfx> Good thing is is that he has common sense
[20:17] <Scrippy> And Notch would still go "Lol no"
[20:17] <Zerim> In the end, yeah, but again, any bad choices hurt him more than us
[20:17] <wolfx> Not with guns
[20:17] <FM4k> Zerim gets the idea.
[20:17] <Scrippy> He is the Executive branch.
[20:17] <FM4k> wolfx: topic migrated from guns ;)
[20:18] <Scrippy> He has veto power.
[20:18] <FM4k> Scrippy: We're the judicial.

[20:18] <Risugami> \/
[20:18] <Brotagonist> We aren't worthy!
[20:18] <FM4k> lol
[20:18] <Scrippy> He may veto it, he may implement it.
[20:18] <Scrippy> But he has the final say.
[20:18] <Zerim> We're the congress, and Notch is everything else
[20:18] <Kitoari> point is, it's up to him
[20:18] <Zerim> >_>
[20:18] <wolfx> ZarroTsu: like it
[20:18] * Risugami looks for good arrow unicode
[20:18] <Scrippy> Kitoari has it right.
[20:18] <FM4k> *sigh* It's up to him if he decides he hates money lol
[20:19] <Scrippy> He has shittons of money.
[20:19] <WateryHell> money
[20:19] <FM4k> Only now
[20:19] <FM4k> which we gave the fucking guy
[20:19] <Scrippy> He's made 400K in the last year.
[20:19] <FM4k> and i'm sure he's a sick programmer on top of it
[20:19] <Scrippy> He could stop producing right now.
[20:19] <FM4k> But he wont.
[20:19] <wolfx> Well taxes are fuck high there
[20:19] <Risugami> ????????????
[20:19] <Brotagonist> Man, I bet he's got some serious taxes
[20:19] <Kitoari> and paypal fees
[20:19] <Risugami> nice
[20:19] <Scrippy> 200K spending money.
[20:19] <FM4k> And all you're arguing in all the world won't change the fact that I'm right ;)
[20:19] <Scrippy> He keeps half.
[20:19] <wolfx> 60% or more
[20:19] <Scrippy> *sigh*
[20:19] <wolfx> Taxed I think
[20:19] <Zerim> It's Notch's business how much he makes. This is not a socialist economy. He's earned what he makes.
[20:19] <Kitoari> FM4k: what is your argument, and why are you so stuck up.
[20:20] <FM4k> Kitoari - Mind if I PM you? :P

[20:21] <Scrippy> And that's a lot of green
[20:21] <Brotagonist> So the donations aren't taxed?

[20:21] <Lantris> Donations are taxed

[20:38] <Skorchy> By adding a new power supply and gfx card.
[20:38] <Brotagonist> Why were you opening it?
[20:38] <Brotagonist> Ohhh.
[20:38] <Zerim> adding a PSU was pretty easy
[20:38] <Skorchy> My parents
[20:38] <Brotagonist> Especially if it's modular

[21:02] <noq> that was your score from the one i posted?

[21:07] <GreyMario> I already did.
[21:07] <Scrippy> Also diphenhydramine = artifically induced sleep deprivation.
[21:07] <Risugami> hobo's have internet and paypal?

[21:14] <TrueWolves|Dead> The sad part is Animator is by far more mature then most people I know.
[21:14] <EmpiresBane> you're 15?
[21:14] <Rikachu> I know your older noq
[21:14] <Mitagitsu> No noq, I meant I am older than Azure

[21:21] <Mitagitsu> Heh
[21:21] <Deages> hey guys
[21:21] <Risugami> i think memes are funny when you can find people who know them IRL

[21:23] <Scrippy> I call that being socially awkward D=
[21:23] <wolf_alex> someone needs to nuke this place of all the idlers
[21:23] <Mitagitsu> Yes, I use them in real life to find the people that get it, then avoid the ones who actually get it :V
[21:24] <Scrippy> Tarpsocks: Go buy it
[21:24] <Rikachu> THere should be an autokick.
[21:24] <tarpsocks> scrippy: why should i buy it
[21:24] <wolf_alex> indeed

[21:33] <Mitagitsu> I got into gaming right when the N64 came out I think
[21:33] <Scrippy> Never owned an N64.
[21:33] <IceFlinger> I was born playing SNES
[21:33] <IceFlinger> Grew up with N64
[21:33] <Risugami> and Sonic the hedgehog was probably first game
[21:33] <Scrippy> I was a Playstation/gameboy kid.
[21:33] <IceFlinger> good times
[21:34] <EmpiresBane> anybody else notice slimes don't split when killed with a sword?
[21:34] <EmpiresBane> is that on purpose?
[21:34] <Rikachu> scrippy, ppl start playing games at different ages.
[21:34] <IceFlinger> I cannot recall any time of my life I didn't play video games
[21:34] <Rikachu> Yes that is on purpose.
[21:34] <Scrippy> True
[21:34] <EmpiresBane> that's dumb
[21:34] <Scrippy> But it still baffles me when people know nothing of the classics
[21:34] <Rikachu> As time went on though, I started playing indie games the most.
[21:34] <Scrippy> Like Mortal Kombat
[21:34] <Risugami> no scratch that first system was Gameboy, and tetris/DKL was first game
[21:34] <EmpiresBane> my first system was the virtual boy
[21:35] <Scrippy> I still have my big grey gameboy
[21:35] <Scrippy> Wow
[21:35] <Rikachu> ^^
[21:35] <Risugami> that must have sucked

[21:35] <GreyMario> Oh man I remember that thing
[21:35] <Scrippy> Wait no
[21:35] <Scrippy> I'm thinking of something different
[21:35] <EmpiresBane> the virtual boy was amazing!
[21:35] <Rikachu> My first was PS2.
[21:35] <EmpiresBane> too bad the left eye is out of alignment now...
[21:35] <Firetempest> i pawned my brick to get a gameboy pocket

[21:39] <Rikachu> I know nothing about how the servers work.
[21:39] <ShaunMH> aw

[21:39] <ShaunMH> i cant host a server to play with my gf at all
[21:39] <Mitagitsu> Is anyone getting the 3DS at launch?
[21:39] <ShaunMH> it just wont generate the files so i cant play
[21:39] <noq> what question
[21:39] <Rikachu> You can try asking the forums.
[21:39] <EmpiresBane> not at launch
[21:39] <Mitagitsu> When I saw the list of games announced for it already, I am soooo buying that.
[21:39] <Risugami> i think getting consoles at launch is stupid
[21:39] <ShaunMH> Yeah ill try that if no one here knows
[21:39] <ShaunMH> @noq starting a server.
[21:39] <EmpiresBane> but i am getting the 3ds

[21:39] <ShaunMH> My game wont generate the files i need to start one
[21:39] <EmpiresBane> when is it released?

[21:40] <ShaunMH> just to see if i get different results

[22:06] <techk8> DEMONS'S SOULS
[22:06] <tman523> BEJEWLED ON MY RAZER!
[22:06] <CyanRyan> you know what's not casual?
[22:06] <tman523> FUCK YEAH!
[22:06] <CyanRyan> Minecraft
[22:06] <mnjiman> Puzzle QUEST!!!!!!!!!
[22:06] <Rikachu> Tetris.
[22:06] <tman523> Minecraft is so indepth
[22:06] <Risugami> i played FarmVille then got bored doing the exact same thing over and over. it sucks
[22:06] <techk8> Tetris can be literally hardcore
[22:06] <Mitagitsu> You know what the manly-ist game of all time is?
[22:06] <CyanRyan> FARMVILLE
[22:06] <Mitagitsu> HARVEST MOON

[22:06] <tman523> I hate it when people see me playing it then are like: "lol casual"
[22:06] <Rikachu> DAMN IT I WA GOING TO SAY THAT!
[22:06] <Mitagitsu> :3
[22:06] <Rikachu> I was thinking of harvest moon.
[22:06] <techk8> Maria is the best
[22:06] <Risugami> yea Harvest moon is fun, but Rune Factory is alot better
[22:06] <Hourhero> PEGGLE
[22:07] <mnjiman> Minecraft is casual Tman523

[22:07] <Rikachu> 6.
[22:07] <Conundrumer> 10
[22:07] <mnjiman> the length of time you can play a game isnt in reference to whether its casual or not, its the difficulty of the game + the indepthness that can be involved
[22:07] <techk8> and take away Farmville
[22:07] <Conundrumer> ....in base 4
[22:07] <Hourhero> ShaunMH , yes
[22:07] <Risugami> 22

[22:08] <techk8> no joke

[22:14] <tman523> What's your steam?
[22:14] <techk8> THE BEST THING ABOUT ALIEN SWAMRM IS THAT IT RUNS OFF STEAM'S SDK

[22:24] <mnjiman> If/when Notch adds Landclaim flags, he thinks it will involve gold

[22:25] <tman523> Is a trading system being worked or thought of..?
[22:26] <Hourhero> hopefully
[22:26] <techk8> Just to throw this out: no currency system
[22:26] <Flot> When Notch went to sleep last night: "Oh cool, someone made a Minecraft map, I think I'll post that on my blog."
[22:27] <Flot> When Notch wakes up: "Hey Notch, Brandon from Valve here. Want Minecraft on Steam?"
[22:27] <Risugami> at least some kind of secure trade, no currency please

[22:27] <Hourhero> he should have a place to buy and sell stuff to npcs
[22:27] <Flot> Trading an item for another item isn't called trading, it's called bartering.

[22:29] <tman523> farming*
[22:29] <WateryHell> It does

[22:29] <techk8> Between a griefer, and a theif?
[22:29] <techk8> *thief
[22:29] <Flot> No need for farms, unless you're offland on an artificial island.

[22:30] <Flot> Player: Destroys everything you own, then takes some stuff.
[22:30] <techk8> I mean, I wanna be a renegrade thief
[22:30] <Flot> It all makes sense now!!!
[22:30] <techk8> Taking weapons, food, etc. from camps
[22:30] <techk8> And hiding in the woods/caves
[22:30] <Flot> Pfft.
[22:30] <Flot> Hiding.
[22:30] <Risugami> herding would be nice though
[22:30] <Flot> The best thief steals without people knowing.
[22:30] <WateryHell> Thief: Stealing from chests
[22:30] <techk8> You get the point, right?
[22:31] <tman523> I want to TNT peoples' homes in SMP and take the stuff they drop and loot the house...am I griefer? or just a player?
[22:31] <WateryHell> Grief
[22:31] <GreyMario> You are a killer.
[22:31] <Flot> A player.
[22:31] <tman523> So
[22:31] <GreyMario> A player, but a killer.
[22:31] <tman523> I kill people in games all the time
[22:31] <tman523> Why not MC>
[22:31] <Risugami> a player would just steal, griefers destroy
[22:31] <Flot> Pfft. OMG YOU DESTROYED MY HOUSE TO STEAL MY STUFF GRIEFER GRIEFER ADMIN PLZ BAN!!!
[22:31] <Cheeseum> you're a very very dilligent creeper killer
[22:31] <techk8> Wow, you sure are hardcore.
[22:31] <techk8> OTL
[22:31] <Flot> Dummies.
[22:31] * cynicalAlchemist sees Notch's twitter and sees that he has obtained starcraft and then said "damn.
[22:31] <Cheeseum> that gunpowder is valuable stuff
[22:32] <techk8> Diamond too (for noobs)
[22:32] <Flot> Uh, no?
[22:32] <Flot> Diamond is valuable for everyone.
[22:32] <Risugami> agreed, gunpowder could be worth alot in a trade
[22:32] <Risugami> since creepers don't spawn from spawners
[22:32] <Kitoari> gunpowder is going to be very valuable, yes
[22:32] <Risugami> can't farm it
[22:33] <tman523> So you're telling me that if I tunnle under your house, a project that could take (game)days for me just so that I can stretigically blow your unexpecting ass up and take all your stuff, that's griefing?
[22:33] <Cheeseum> sssssss may soon become a wonderful sound to hear
[22:33] <Kitoari> I could see gunpower <-> diamond trades
[22:33] <tman523> I think it's part of the game
[22:33] <hassifa> http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=mehiffa
[22:33] <Risugami> don't blow it up, not a griefer then
[22:33] <hassifa> really shouldnt be this bored
[22:33] <Flot> Value of functional items: Diamond > Gunpowder > Iron >Redstone > Coal > Wood
[22:33] <tman523> Why not?
[22:33] <Flot> Obviously.
[22:33] <Risugami> just dig into house and steal shit
[22:33] <Flot> Redstone, Coal, and Wood are going to be pretty useless.
[22:33] <Flot> For selling.
[22:34] <Azu> Flot -- toss clay in there possibly?
[22:34] <techk8> More like Diamond=Gunpowder>Iron>Redstone>>>Coal>>>>>>Wood>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Dirt
[22:34] <Flot> Clay would probably be between Iron and Redstone.
[22:34] <Boris-B> Hey guys, I just got minecraft (I'm on Arch Linux) and It won't start. It can't find something in java.lang. Can anyone help?
[22:34] <Flot> Clay is semi-rare, but found in abundance.
[22:34] <Azu> also gunpowder is renewable, diamond is hidden and exhaustable

[22:34] <tman523> Why just steal? TNT doesn't really do THAT much damage. I just want to kill thwe guy to take what he has on him
[22:34] <tman523> He can repair the reletivly small hole when he gets home
[22:35] <Flot> Diamond is exhaustible, but there is tons of it, even on a finite map.
[22:35] <Risugami> if he gets home from spawn point
[22:35] <Flot> The average small indev map has at least 500 diamonds.
[22:35] <Flot> All located near the bottom z-level.
[22:35] <tman523> Red Powerd is at the bottom
[22:35] <Flot> Yeah, but it's very common down there.
[22:35] <techk8> Man, I imagine tman trying to kill people in a camp
[22:35] <tman523> Always afriad I'm gonna fall through when mining that shit
[22:36] <techk8> and when one gets hurt by the tnt
[22:36] <Flot> It's technically more common than coal down there, but I put it ahead of coal because you have to make the effort to get down there.
[22:36] <techk8> he activates a security system
[22:36] <techk8> causing tman to be chased by the entire camp
[22:36] <Risugami> besides a real player would try to kill you with arrows
[22:36] <tman523> Dude, I would set up traps

[22:37] <Cheeseum> Boris-B: http://omploader.org/vNTJ1Ng/minecraft my script to launch it, make sure proprietary jre is installed
[22:37] <Flot> TNT isn't activated with arrows though, are they?
[22:37] <Boris-B> Cheeseum, thanks I'll look into it...
[22:37] <Risugami> at least that isn't griefing
[22:37] <Dommys> No, Flot
[22:38] <tman523> Dude, I would never go and systimatically dismantle someone's work. But I have no problems if it gets a bit damaged while I'm just playing the way I like to play
[22:38] <Keiya> I wonder if Minecrat will hit 1000 sales in 24 hours?
[22:38] <Hourhero> shooting tnt with arrows dosent set it off
[22:39] <Flot> Steam forums whines about everything.
[22:39] <tman523> Then I'd set up a red powder/lever combo
[22:39] <Hourhero> why must there be trols
[22:39] <Flot> They won't buy it right off the bat.
[22:39] <tman523> Is MC on Steam..?
[22:39] <Fisheatsbear> no :/
[22:39] <Hourhero> its a browser game
[22:39] <Flot> It will be soon, most likely.
[22:39] <Hourhero> but it's a browser game
[22:39] <Flot> Hour, it's not a browser game anymore. It can be palyed on a client.

[22:41] <Flot> Yup. Brandon from Valve told Notch to "respond to his email." It could mean lots of things really, from Minecraft coming to Steam or Notch being hired by Valve: Which IMO, wouldn't be too good for Minecraft.

[22:41] <IceFlinger> Yeah
[22:41] <tman523> Servers 'n shit yo
[22:41] <Flot> It would be good for Valve, but definitely not for Minecraft, unless it was made a commercial product.
[22:41] <IceFlinger> I was amazed when I saw the blogpost because they've never done something like that
[22:41] <IceFlinger> Except for gang garrison 2
[22:41] <IceFlinger> but that IS TF2
[22:41] <Flot> I know what you mean.

[22:42] <Flot> Yeah, Notch getting hired by Valve.... eh.
[22:42] <Einherjar> Do not want.
[22:42] <Flot> Remember before Notch quit his job at King? How he only updated Minecraft once a week?
[22:42] <Flot> Sometimes less?
[22:42] <Risugami> that could be possible though
[22:43] <Kitoari> only once a week.
[22:43] <Risugami> he is a programmer they are a business
[22:43] <Cheeseum> maybe brandon just wants to know the secret to the extreme memory optimization
[22:43] <tman523> When your game gets on Steam Valve doesn't "Hire you"
[22:43] <_Sata_> oh neat
[22:43] <Risugami> they want quality programmers
[22:43] <_Sata_> I just found a bug
[22:43] <_Sata_> maybe it's known
[22:43] <_Sata_> anyone could tell if I said what it was?
[22:43] <Flot> Right now, Minecraft is Notch's work. If he gets hired at a job that pays over $100K a year, he might just take it...
[22:43] <Fisheatsbear> im sure notch will get more money by flying solo
[22:43] <tman523> it's like free advertising and they keep a % of the profits
[22:43] <Hourhero> _Sata_ your not supposed to tell others about hacks
[22:44] <_Sata_> not a hack
[22:44] <_Sata_> a bug
[22:44] <Keiya> Notch working out a distribution agreement and integrating nicely with Steam, would be cool
[22:44] <Flot> Valve is a multimillion dollar company, Fish. They have made no less than 6 best-selling titles.
[22:44] <_Sata_> it's a glitch
[22:44] <Hourhero> \sam difference
[22:44] <tman523> Valve doesn't look fro programmers like that :P 90% of the games on Steam are NOT Valve
[22:44] <Hourhero> same
[22:44] <tman523> They don't even work for valve
[22:44] <_Sata_> same difference?
[22:44] <_Sata_> that doesn't make sense
[22:44] <tman523> it's simply a selling contract
[22:44] <Hourhero> you dont either
[22:44] <Fisheatsbear> gwa
[22:44] <tman523> They sell the game for him
[22:44] <tman523> they keep some of the money
[22:44] <tman523> that simple
[22:44] <Flot> tman, Counter Strike, TF2, Alien Swarm, and L4D are all products started by modders/other development teams that Valve saw.
[22:44] <tman523> he doesn't work for them
[22:44] <Risugami> content distibution service
[22:44] <WateryHell> Minecraft + Steam = Good, but a HUEG community
[22:45] <Flot> TF*
[22:45] <tman523> Flot: okay, but they can't own Minecraft
[22:45] <Flot> Not tf2 :P

[22:45] <Cheeseum> or the incredible lole
[22:45] <Fisheatsbear> draggin me down
[22:46] <Hourhero> they should put it on ps3 so it would have a game
[22:46] <Cheeseum> xbox with minecraft on it would be hilarious
[22:46] <Flot> It takes at least 2GB of RAM to run Minecraft well on a computer. The 360 only has 512MB of shared RAM.
[22:46] <WateryHell> @_@
[22:46] <Cheeseum> you'd get so many complaints of overheating and 2 frames per second
[22:46] <Flot> lol @ 360 not being able to run a java game
[22:46] <Hourhero> or any game
[22:46] <Hourhero> zing
[22:46] <WateryHell> Minecraft would be better as a PS3 port
[22:46] <tarpsocks> minecrafters
[22:46] <Fisheatsbear> at least it has games
[22:46] <Miclee> I can picture it, now
[22:46] <Miclee> Minecraft: Source
[22:46] <tarpsocks> i hope minecraft beta is good
[22:47] <_Sata_> the only good to come out of this bug
[22:47] <_Sata_> is killing yourself
[22:47] <Flot> Minecraft beta is the alpha you're playing right now, man! Notch said that multiplayer is the last thing before beta.
[22:47] <_Sata_> I'll just say it
[22:47] <Hourhero> _Sata_ what is it
[22:47] <Flot> ... Which is sad because he also said seasons would be in before beta.
[22:47] <_Sata_> you can place blocks on yourself
[22:47] <_Sata_> if you're in a stream
[22:47] <Hourhero> duh
[22:47] <Risugami> wonder if Notch will ever add natural ramps
[22:47] <_Sata_> it's a glitch
[22:47] <Hourhero> that's known _Sata_
[22:47] <_Sata_> yeah I figured so
[22:48] <Keiya> Oh, can you do rail tracks on top of staircases?
[22:48] <WateryHell> no
[22:48] <Keiya> Aww.
[22:48] <WateryHell> Normal blocks= yea
[22:48] <Keiya> It worked so nicely in the TF2 map :P
[22:48] <WateryHell> TF2 =/= Minecraft
[22:48] <Keiya> Fixed the jumping-up-after-it problem
[22:48] <Keiya> WateryHell: I...know.
[22:49] <Keiya> I'm saying this as part of my reasons for wanting it >_>
[22:49] <WateryHell> Wait, you no has TF2?
[22:49] <Hourhero> i still think guns in minecraft could work, i mean they got bows and arrows
[22:49] <Hourhero> so it's just a zombie shooter
[22:49] <Azu> I don't get why you can't place various things on glass
[22:50] <Azu> that seems weird and unnecessary
[22:50] <Hourhero> cause it would look strange
[22:50] <WateryHell> Such as torches
[22:50] <Hourhero> riddle me this, why can dirt float in mid air
[22:50] <Risugami> magic dirt
[22:50] <Keiya> WateryHell: No
[22:50] <Azu> I've wanted minecart tracks on glass forever

[22:55] <tehcid> still gets a whopping 180k
[22:55] <Hourhero> i use dollars not ureos
[22:55] <Hourhero> can you calculate it in american and canadian

[23:39] <CyborgDragon> not really
[23:39] <Zaneo> it just has a custom tileset
[23:39] <CyborgDragon> zaneo, no, it's different
[23:39] <exe_> and shadows on creative servers
[23:39] <CyborgDragon> MD is it's own game and can render minecraft worlds and servers
[23:39] <Cat> go away exe
[23:39] <CyborgDragon> wom is a wrapper
[23:40] <CyborgDragon> it uses the minecraft.jar itself
[23:40] <Cat> yes, but wom is decompiled version of MC ;)
[23:40] <CyborgDragon> it isnt decompiled, it uses the minecraft.jar itself
[23:40] <Zaneo> So then MD is less intrusive?

[23:40] <TrueWolves> I do.
[23:41] <CyborgDragon> me too
[23:41] <Risugami> it injects code or something
[23:41] <Keiya_> Honestly, the problem with MD on Minecraft servers
[23:41] <Keiya_> Is support headaches
[23:41] <Cat> notch is happy that stfff like MD is made

[23:41] <Keiya_> Was it because of MD?
[23:41] <Keiya_> And that's a good reason to not like alternate clients :P
[23:42] <Fisheatsbear> "Lives in a pineapple under the sea!" << yellow text ftw
[23:42] <Zaneo> The server is responsible for handling code thrown at it..
[23:42] <Zaneo> it shouldn't be brought down by MD
[23:42] <Flot> Who cares about Manic Digger. It can't be used maliciously.
[23:42] <Flot> I think it's cool!
[23:42] <exe_> md is going to implement infdev multiplayer too :/
[23:42] * Tukiko is now known as Tukiko|Wet
[23:42] <CyborgDragon> zaneo, the vanilla server lets you crash the server by placing a non-minecraft block type
[23:42] <Flot> If that's so, then that's so. If Notch cares enough about MD allowing this, then he will just find a way to stop it.
[23:42] <Zaneo> McTunnel...
[23:43] <Keiya_> Zaneo: Well, yeah. But it makes it harder to track down what happened.
[23:43] <Zerim> what is MD
[23:43] <Zerim> >_>
[23:43] <Flot> Mine Digger.
[23:43] <CyborgDragon> MD=Manic Digger

[23:43] <exe_> nooo, thats ugly video!
[23:43] <Keiya_> Though, I'm tempted to try to hack together weird games on top of Manic Digger. It being opensourcy makes it nicer for that than Minecraft...
