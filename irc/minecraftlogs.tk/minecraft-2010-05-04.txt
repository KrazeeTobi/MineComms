[0:00] <vurtual> Are you a kid who plays runescape and lives in nowhere?
[0:00] <vurtual> who went down in one punch?
[0:00] <KodaichiZero> Nope
[0:00] <vurtual> Crying?
[0:00] <vurtual> Okay, I'm not your friend.
[0:00] <Dommys> lol
[0:00] <KodaichiZero> I've never tried the Rune
[0:00] <vurtual> The downside, that thing where you act differently around different people sorta goes outta hand, as I'm used to acting like my sarcastic brother around my mom.
[0:00] <vurtual> My source of sarcasm? Above matrix quote, things like the scout, and in general whatever's funny.
[0:01] <Dommys> Meh
[0:01] <hyperhopper> guys... generalchatter goes in #mcchatter
[0:01] <KodaichiZero> >that thing where you act differently around different people
[0:01] <KodaichiZero> that's my life
[0:01] * Grummler (Grummler@f055242185.adsl.alicedsl.de) has joined #minecraft
[0:01] <KodaichiZero> hyperhopper: you must not have been here for long
[0:01] <vurtual> I think I'll play a half-prank by mixing up the music I have running randomly, so it switches suddenly from nine inch nails quake soundtrack to tf2 to mario to star trek
[0:02] <vurtual> to dramatic readings of poorly-written fanfiction
[0:02] <KodaichiZero> we rarely ever talk about minecraft in here.
[0:02] <Dommys> I think the main issue with mcchatter is that it's not moderated by the same folks here.
[0:02] <vurtual> nor does it have the regulars
[0:02] <Dommys> It's literally a completely seperate chanel
[0:02] <vurtual> I'm the life of the party.
[0:02] <Plus-san> (????????)
[0:02] <Plus-san> ??(????????)
[0:02] <Plus-san> ??(??????????)
[0:03] <KodaichiZero> That's werid
[0:03] <KodaichiZero> WERID
[0:03] <Plus-san> no ur weirs
[0:03] <vurtual> (+)??_??)>@=={==========-
[0:03] <Seiseki> werido
[0:03] <vurtual> have at ye, asian undead.
[0:03] <Plus-san> (?????????)
[0:03] <KodaichiZero> NO U R WERDO
[0:03] <Plus-san> werd up
[0:04] <Plus-san> there needs to be a 'place item into chest' button
[0:04] <vurtual> It doesn't help that to her, I have no friends, and beyond interaction with my parents and rare occasional social events(where I may end up just staring at people ominously because of some people being there), I don't talk to anyone
[0:04] <vurtual> so to her, I just spend all day and night just sitting around, without even the slightest human interaction.
[0:04] * Shori (KamaroHito@199.2.122.109) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:04] * Miclee (Miclee@CPE001839f2360a-CM0012c99a3e00.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:04] <vurtual> You want to place your "item" into my chest, Plus-san?
[0:04] <Plus-san> sure
[0:04] <vurtual> is that name a pun on plus sign
[0:04] <vurtual> but -san
[0:04] * Shadaez (JWheeler@24-113-66-251.wavecable.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:04] * Plus-san shouts tribal chants
[0:04] * Kimd41 (chatzilla@212.183.196.16.dyn.user.ono.com) Quit (Quit: KEN LEE)
[0:04] <KodaichiZero> SAME BROTHA!
[0:05] * Plus-san reaches into vurtual's chest, removes heart
[0:05] <vurtual> The only issue I have is consistent deja vu and dreams
[0:05] <KodaichiZero> Lol
[0:05] <vurtual> :(
[0:05] <KodaichiZero> IRC is social as hell man
[0:05] * vurtual goes down to 2 heart containers
[0:05] * Plus-san drops vurtual into pit of lava
[0:05] * vurtual loses one heart of health
[0:05] * revenant (dlukes@pool-74-111-168-109.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Segmentation fault)
[0:05] <vurtual> <3 -:
[0:05] <Plus-san> and no my name is not a pun
[0:05] <Plus-san> though i do enjoy puns
[0:05] <KodaichiZero> I didn't think it was
[0:05] <vurtual> I'll just mislead her a bit by saying I have 2500 facebook friends.
[0:06] <vurtual> see if she tries to get to know me by getting facebook
[0:06] <vurtual> "No no I use ICQ."
[0:06] <Plus-san> my internet name is +18 and since I don't like numbers and eighteen is long i just use -san
[0:06] <vurtual> Then things like IM and then... 4chan, but I might get shot
[0:06] <Plus-san> on irc at least
[0:06] <Seiseki> dejavu is just the brain faultily sending a realtime impressions/feelings through the memory-part of the brain (in lack of a better word)
[0:06] <vurtual> Seiseki, through time!?
[0:07] * Grummler (Grummler@f055242185.adsl.alicedsl.de) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:07] <Seiseki> what?
[0:07] <vurtual> Because it's like I have a dream and then it happens exactly. This is very common apparently, and can be used to influence what actually happens.
[0:07] * Grummler (Grummler@g226245227.adsl.alicedsl.de) has joined #minecraft
[0:07] <vurtual> Also, one time, I closed my eyes, and I saw my dog burned into my eyes in detail
[0:07] <vurtual> THen later I saw the exact same image when I was looking at my dog actually.
[0:07] * kizzycocoa1 (Mibbit@92.25.62.125) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[0:07] <Seiseki> so your dreams come true?
[0:08] <Plus-san> so are there diamonds in the current build of infdev or have I gone like 40 stone picks worth of blocks in one direction for no reason
[0:08] <vurtual> No it's more like they're arbitrary recordings of unimportant time.
[0:08] <vurtual> there's diamond, Plus-san.
[0:08] <vurtual> desu
[0:08] <Plus-san> well they must be stupidly rare then
[0:08] <vurtual> not really
[0:08] * Dandistine (biocon8600@136.176.103.142) has joined #minecraft
[0:08] <vurtual> Maybe I should learn german guys
[0:08] <Plus-san> then where should i look
[0:08] <vurtual> ground, deep
[0:08] <Plus-san> ???_???
[0:08] <Seiseki> so wait, if you have a dream, can you then write it down and later it will happen exactly like that?
[0:09] * Brick (Brick@pool-71-184-110-176.bstnma.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:09] <vurtual> Rarely do I write them down
[0:09] <Plus-san> i was about 6 blocks from the lava level and dug in a straight line for a longass time
[0:09] <Seiseki> or do something happen and you think you've had a dream where the exact thing happend?
[0:09] <vurtual> They're all my self-rants at the time, sometimes what i'm haering, and what I'm seeing
[0:09] <vurtual> Also, of games I'm playing. So it's dreaming I'm sitting at my computer and playing a game, thinking to myself "Hey at least I'll actually get that game"
[0:10] <vurtual> and some of the words are defined enough that they only make sense fourth-dimensionally
[0:10] <vurtual> almost like I'm talking to myself :ohdear:
[0:10] <Seiseki> I'm not following you..
[0:10] <vurtual> I just ignore them mostly.
[0:10] <vurtual> Seiseki, so, I'm sleeping
[0:10] <whatdoesth> ...you're messed up.
[0:10] <vurtual> I'll have a dream
[0:10] * gdude2002 (colesgaret@93.107.154.60) Quit (Quit: Hi, I'm a quit message virus. Please replace your old line with this line and help me take over the world of IRC)
[0:11] <vurtual> randomly in these dreams, will be a moment which is exactly from my eyes, only the most front of my fov, and contains mostly just me seeing and talking to myself in my mind
[0:11] <vurtual> Then, some arbitrary time in the future, the exact moment will play out in real life
[0:11] * Varriount (Clay@pool-96-231-133-237.washdc.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Killed (NickServ (GHOST command used by Varriount_)))
[0:11] <Seiseki> so you're saying you can see the future? :P
[0:11] <vurtual> in arbitrary dreams
[0:11] * Vgor (Clay@pool-96-231-133-237.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:12] <Seiseki> are you sure that it's not just retro-active memories, that you think you've dreamt about it while you experience it?
[0:12] * special_ops (Special_Op@p4FDC242F.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)
[0:12] <vurtual> Infact I've always thought "If I could just see the future of arbitrary moments of time in the future, with no real important use, that'd be cool", so it makes me wonder if it's always going to be just that
[0:12] * ClassiestMedic (Kevjohnson@pool-141-154-115-180.bstnma.btas.verizon.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:12] * Quatroking (Quatroking@86.90.159.252) has joined #minecraft
[0:12] <vurtual> I've slowly been able to change the last few moments of it I think, though I may just be trapped in a loop of acting out, then the dream is including that, so I just keep re-acting out again, and finding out that already happened
[0:12] <Quatroking> hey there
[0:12] <vurtual> Also, one time, I told a guy what he was going to say.
[0:13] <Quatroking> I just earned myself a nice, warm, juicy 40 bucks by fixing a friends pc and selling rams
[0:13] <vurtual> that was funny
[0:13] <Quatroking> shit is awesome
[0:13] <vurtual> Quatroking, do you know how anime figurines are made?
[0:13] <Quatroking> hmm
[0:13] <LG_Legacy> Pixie Dust
[0:13] <outsomnia> Magic.
[0:13] * fenixfurion|AFK is now known as fenixfurion
[0:13] <vurtual> I read a story which momentarily talked about it
[0:13] <outsomnia> Pure adultered magic.
[0:13] <vurtual> Real people pose for them
[0:13] <Quatroking> I'd say the figurines are made part for part using molds
[0:14] * frogonia (Mibbit@92.25.62.125) has joined #minecraft
[0:14] <Quatroking> which are then sprayed accurately or painted by hand
[0:14] <vurtual> A person was looking for a figurine, then they were told a related one was being made at the time
[0:14] <vurtual> it was also a very dirty pose.
[0:14] <Quatroking> the molds themselves are most probably designed using 3D software along with 3D printers
[0:14] <vurtual> so most/all of the figurines lying around in your house(including that one) had real people posing for them in costume.
[0:15] <vurtual> to create a design
[0:15] * amphibulus (Mibbit@92.25.62.125) has joined #minecraft
[0:15] <vurtual> especially more dirty ones.
[0:15] <outsomnia> So all of those figurines were hand-made?
[0:15] <Seiseki> vurtual, either your brain is confusing realtime events with memories or you're delusional because I refuse to believe you experience flashforwards in your dreams :P
[0:15] <Quatroking> vurtual, same goes for my nendoroids?
[0:15] <vurtual> no, manufactured
[0:15] <vurtual> seiseki, people also refuse to believe I have friends
[0:15] <vurtual> do you not exist
[0:16] <Quatroking> vurtual you're a robot.
[0:16] <Seiseki> you said you didn't have friends? :P
[0:16] <amphibulus> when is notch usually on?
[0:16] <Quatroking> Therefore, you cannot simulate human feelings 100% accurately
[0:16] <vurtual> I do teechnically, IRC.
[0:16] <amphibulus> ugh
[0:16] <Seiseki> well.. IRL :P
[0:16] <vurtual> but nobody irl believes I have friends.
[0:16] <Seiseki> ah
[0:16] * amphibulus is now known as kizzycocoa
[0:16] <whatdoesth> I do hope for your sake you're just trolling. Otherwise you probably should see someone about the fact that you believe you see the future.
[0:16] <Quatroking> which means you are unable to experience friendship
[0:16] <Quatroking> thus, no friends.
[0:16] <vurtual> whatdoesth, I've had no reason to not believe that
[0:16] <vurtual> I'm like, hey, cool, that happens.
[0:16] <vurtual> and then get on with my life
[0:16] <vurtual> It's an interesting novelty that happens
[0:17] <Quatroking> I should probably clean out my keyboard tomorrow, there's fucking salsa behind my F1 key and several other keys are covered with dorito dust
[0:17] <vurtual> stop being so mundane guys
[0:17] * CruelNoise (cruelnoise@64-7-147-204.agas1a-dynamic.dsl.sentex.ca) has joined #minecraft
[0:17] <vurtual> so what if something illogical is happening, and nobody cares to deal with it?
[0:17] <Quatroking> vurtual answer me
[0:17] * Vgor (Clay@pool-96-231-133-237.washdc.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Join the hollow hills server! Oh, and cats are cool)
[0:18] <vurtual> Nobody's put forth a theory that fits well with the events themselves and screw thinking
[0:18] * Ksg89 (nn@cpc5-shef10-0-0-cust136.barn.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:18] <Quatroking> are nendoroids made using real humans
[0:18] <vurtual> answer what
[0:18] <Quatroking> or at elast designed
[0:18] <vurtual> pic
[0:18] <Quatroking> least*
[0:18] <Seiseki> well I have no doubt as to how the human brain can deceive us, after all we get all our input from our brains so it's a bit biased and it can go haywire, and the probability for that is much much larger than someone actually seeing the future
[0:18] <Quatroking> pic?
[0:18] <vurtual> of these things
[0:18] <Quatroking> hold on
[0:18] * outsomnia (wahaha@69.233.226.178) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:18] <vurtual> we get input from nerves Seiseki
[0:18] <Quatroking> http://quatroking.jalbum.net/Quatroking%27s-Bedroom/ number 7
[0:18] <vurtual> unless we really do have psychic powers
[0:18] <rob`> It takes a perverse turn of mind to leap from "something weird is happening" to "psychic powers".
[0:19] <Seiseki> yeah, but what part of our body does translate the sensory input from the nerves?
[0:19] <rob`> weird things can happen that are nonetheless perfectly explicable, even if you don't know the explanation
[0:19] <vurtual> It takes an easily amused mind, rob`.
[0:19] <kizzycocoa> uh, when is notch on? :S
[0:19] <Quatroking> I'm talking about the eleven schoolgirls in picture 7
[0:19] <Quatroking> kizzycocoa, who's Notch?
[0:19] * frogonia (Mibbit@92.25.62.125) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[0:19] <vurtual> I dunno

[0:19] * Shadaez (JWheeler@24-113-66-251.wavecable.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:20] <vurtual> it sounds offtopic, kizzycocoa, might want to take it to #mcchatter
[0:20] <kizzycocoa> ..........
[0:20] <Quatroking> Ralph made Minecraft
[0:20] <kizzycocoa> uh, I think you'll find, this is his official room
[0:20] <Seiseki> philosophically speaking we can't really trust anything, not even ourselves
[0:20] <vurtual> no
[0:20] <vurtual> this is about being creepy
[0:20] <kizzycocoa> any you're talking about being phychic
[0:20] <vurtual> normally speaking, I can tell people I CAN SEE THE FUUUUUTUUUUURE, and screw with them
[0:20] * ralphie (Mibbit@86.90.159.252) has joined #minecraft
[0:20] <kizzycocoa> *and
[0:20] <rob`> kizzycocoa: he's just being an ass. you see, in 4chan, trolling is how they mate.

[0:21] <kizzycocoa> that isn't even possible :/
[0:21] <ralphie> made of RAINBOWS
[0:21] <kizzycocoa> that isn't even possible :/
[0:21] <Quatroking> rainbow toilets
[0:21] <Quatroking> omg
[0:21] <kizzycocoa> now, does anyone know when he's on?
[0:21] <Seiseki> I have a lot of lucid dreams and I've had my share of battles against my subconcious :P
[0:21] <rob`> Seiseki: no kidding, eh. The veil of perception is thick enough without wanting to add to it or find more reasons to doubt its veracity. :/
[0:21] <vurtual> http://www.wallstory-murals.co.uk/mural_images/Rainbow%20clouds/Over%20the%20rainbow.gif like this ralphie?
[0:22] <ralphie> im also considering adding mechanical unicorns

[0:22] <vurtual> kizzycocoa, nobody knows
[0:22] <kizzycocoa> which isn't off topic, compared to you lot
[0:22] * revenant (dlukes@pool-74-111-168-109.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:22] <vurtual> instead of saying no like we have TEN THOUSAND TIMES
[0:22] <ralphie> I shall add mechanical unicorns that shoot 4D bananas using their turds
[0:23] <kizzycocoa> no-one at all? :/
[0:23] <vurtual> we be humorous and hillarious
[0:23] <rob`> Oh, usually he's not. Signs in maybe once a week, and it'll be on Swedish time.
[0:23] <Quatroking> kizzycocoa, really, who is Notch
[0:23] <vurtual> it's like the halloweentown people
[0:23] <Konogan> Guys, I think I got the asperger syndrome, lol.
[0:23] <ralphie> isnt notch that guy who pretends to be the creator of my game
[0:23] <vurtual> we just love a good lol
[0:23] <vurtual> Konogan okay let me diagnose you
[0:23] <Quatroking> konogan: why
[0:23] <AzureAngelic> df just crashed again
[0:23] <vurtual> firstly, can you tell when people aren't talking?
[0:23] <AzureAngelic> time to build the magma forge for the third time :rage:
[0:23] <vurtual> do you have exactly one obsession?
[0:23] <Quatroking> vurtual: I can
[0:23] <Konogan> What?
[0:23] <Quatroking> vurtual, I have multiple obsessions
[0:23] <vurtual> do you have a good sense of balance, konogan?
[0:24] <mezo> vurtual why can't you go outside?
[0:24] <vurtual> multiple obsessions is not aspergers, it's being obsessed
[0:24] <Quatroking> bullshit vurtual
[0:24] <mezo> do you have an immune system deficiency?
[0:24] <Konogan> XD
[0:24] <Quatroking> I'm obsessed with Computers and Japan
[0:24] <vurtual> no, people don't like me being outside barefoot
[0:24] <Seiseki> you mean obsessive? :P
[0:24] <Quatroking> and I have asspergers
[0:24] <vurtual> no you don't.
[0:24] <mezo> allergic to socks or shoes?
[0:24] <Quatroking> lol I didn't intend to spell it that way
[0:24] <vurtual> I like running barefoot
[0:24] <vurtual> good for balance
[0:24] <Quatroking> oh well
[0:25] <ralphie> I'm going to rub my butt until it burns

[0:25] <ralphie> oh shit
[0:25] <Seiseki> people with aspbergers can't tell when people are talking or not? O.o
[0:25] * ralphie is on fire

[0:25] <vurtual> Seiseki, they'll go on and on without any regard to people going wtf.
[0:25] <vurtual> I think my mom claimed I had aspergers once, when yelling(she rarely yells, and it was a long time ago), and she denies it.
[0:26] <Seiseki> so they can't tell when to stop talking?
[0:26] <vurtual> not very easily
[0:26] <Quatroking> vurtual you're pretty much wrong now
[0:26] <vurtual> also, extreme single obsessions.
[0:26] <vurtual> wikipedia said so
[0:26] <Seiseki> lol, sounds like my dad when he's drunk
[0:26] <Konogan> XD
[0:26] <Quatroking> I have aspergers and stuff
[0:26] <vurtual> you go on and on about your japan Quatroking
[0:26] <rob`> Asperger's is a rare condition used by dicks to justify their dickery on the Internet, most of the time.
[0:26] <vurtual> also you probably don't have aspergers
[0:26] <rob`> I'm not convinced it actually exists.
[0:26] <Quatroking> vurtual, I'm also obsessed with computers
[0:26] <vurtual> everyone is
[0:26] <vurtual> it's called being normal
[0:27] <vurtual> and advanced
[0:27] <Quatroking> tell that to school
[0:27] <Konogan> XD
[0:27] <Seiseki> asperbergers have a lot of different definitions though?
[0:27] <Quatroking> fag
[0:27] <vurtual> schools suck
[0:27] <vurtual> screw them

[0:27] <vurtual> with a blowtorch
[0:27] <vurtual> I told her my sense of balance was way too sharp for any kind of aspergers
[0:27] <Quatroking> vurtual are nendoroids designed using real people
[0:27] <vurtual> then she was like I NEVER SAID THAT
[0:27] <Quatroking> you still didn't answer you sick fuck

[0:27] <vurtual> nobody knows how the little ones are made Quatroking
[0:27] <rob`> Seiseki: Your best bet is to pull up the wikipedia page or something.
[0:27] <Quatroking> its magic
[0:27] <vurtual> some say resized people, some say rough proportions, some say 3D models
[0:27] <Quatroking> I'd say 3D models
[0:27] <Konogan> well, I do have less balance than most people :P

[0:28] <vurtual> can you walk linearly with your heels hitting between steps, Konogan?
[0:28] <Seiseki> I doubt wikipedia will have the solutions since it's quite a loosely defined diagnosis
[0:28] <Konogan> but I mean, even a normal dude could have a balance problem :P
[0:28] <vurtual> wikipedia has everythiiing
[0:28] <whatdoesth> Who needs doctors when you have wikipedia to diagnose your made-up conditions?
[0:28] <vurtual> I don't think aspergers was known for like... giving people superbalance and ninja-like confidence in acrobatics.
[0:28] <rob`> heh, no kidding
[0:28] <Konogan> my heels hitting between steps? what do you mean?
[0:28] <vurtual> it's a kind of walk
[0:29] <vurtual> which people with aspergers have a hard time doing I think, not sure
[0:29] <rob`> I used to do the heel thing when i was, like, eight
[0:29] <Quatroking> crabwalk?
[0:29] <vurtual> I wondered about it, then noticed I did it subconsciously
[0:29] <Quatroking> or like mc hammer
[0:29] <vurtual> you walk forward Quatroking
[0:29] <vurtual> walk normally, but when one foot is going infrotn of the other, your feet are close enough that he heels hit.
[0:29] <vurtual> then your foot keeps going normally
[0:29] <Quatroking> oh line linewalk
[0:29] <Quatroking> like*
[0:29] <Quatroking> like when your drunk and the cop tells you to walk a line
[0:29] <vurtual> basically
[0:30] <Quatroking> lemme try

[0:30] <Quatroking> done
[0:30] <vurtual> I think at this rate of increasing acrobatic maneuvers, I'll be even cooler soon
[0:30] <Quatroking> shit is easy
[0:30] <Seiseki> I read that people with aspergers lack certain "things" in the brain which are used to playback anything we see but with ourselves being the subject, like if we see someone getting hit, a couple kissing, etc.
[0:30] <vurtual> you don't have asparagus-burgers, Quatroking.
[0:30] <Quatroking> I do
[0:30] <Quatroking> I even have a pass saying it
[0:30] <Quatroking> do i need to make a picture of it
[0:30] <vurtual> you just proved you don't have one of the main symptoms ok
[0:31] <vurtual> schools are horrible at diagnosing
[0:31] <vurtual> They'd say I have it.
[0:31] <Quatroking> school?
[0:31] <Quatroking> lolwut
[0:31] <Konogan> I can do it, but i wouldn't qualify it easy...
[0:31] <Quatroking> I'm been in special education for 6 years
[0:31] <ZomBuster> hello
[0:31] <Quatroking> I've*
[0:31] <vurtual> infact nobody can diagnose aspergers certainly enough, so they accept everyone under it.
[0:31] <Quatroking> I really have keyboard aids today
[0:31] <ZomBuster> discussing Quatrokings mental health are we?
[0:31] <Seiseki> and those "things" in the brain are what makes us able to put ourselves into someone elses situation and feel compassion

[0:32] <vurtual> I've sorta never been able to imagine myself boning someone in first person.
[0:32] <blaster> You vote on the best suggestions
[0:32] <vurtual> It's third person, and my rough mental self-image makes it too much like imagining another guy
[0:32] <Konogan> vurtual, I can do the line thing, but I wouldn't qualify it easy.
[0:32] <Seiseki> no one can change the future silly!!!
[0:33] <blaster> Ok, it could change what notch makes first after beta is out
[0:33] <vurtual> open space or open space, blaster
[0:33] <vurtual> hmmmmm
[0:33] <blaster> Nominate some shit vurtual
[0:33] <rob`> vurtual: too much porn?
[0:33] <vurtual> I nominate rape mode
[0:33] <vurtual> no rob, too much thirdperson
[0:33] <blaster> As long as there is a post in suggestions, you can nominate it
[0:33] <Konogan> Seisiki, you can change dimension so you experiance another future though :D
[0:33] <vurtual> Also I'm actually trying hard to find reasons to have aspergers.
[0:33] <vurtual> Like me hating most societies.
[0:34] <blaster> Vurtual is rape mode your final nomination?
[0:34] <Seiseki> that's just being anti-social
[0:34] <vurtual> and easily accepting strange or unusual things by not caring
[0:34] <Seiseki> or insecure
[0:34] <vurtual> I'm not insecure.
[0:34] <blaster> Vurtaul are you nominating rape mode or was that a joke?

[0:49] <vurtual> I don't like anyone's ideas
[0:49] <vurtual> never seen good ones

[0:52] <vurtual> then, hl2, since it's sorta modern(requires modern stuff) but easy to run.
[0:52] <blaster> Oh i see
[0:52] <vurtual> then crysis
[0:52] <blaster> Can it run Empire total war, as far as I know that is even higher spec

[0:59] <DrakeHiggins> haha
[0:59] <whatdoesth> The FoV seems a bit too low for fullscreen 16:10, it's not a major problem, and a slider to set it for personal preference is probably the best option.

[1:01] <Dommys> lol, Visiiri
[1:01] <Dommys> Welcome to reality
[1:01] <blaster> Ez is his girlfreind
[1:01] <Seiseki> which is why no one will really be interested in the thread
[1:01] <Visiiri> Shiiiiit
[1:01] <Visiiri> I've been here for alot longer than all of you
[1:01] <Visiiri> and I didn't know that
[1:01] <Naxza> Chances are, he won't consider most of the ideas there. MineSpaceCraft and RapeCraft just won't float.
[1:02] <blaster> Yes, but naxza you can nominate something which will
[1:02] <DrakeHiggins> RAPE-CRAFT
[1:02] <blaster> seriously, anything

[1:02] <blaster> I need some sensible ones
[1:03] <Visiiri> http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/user/visiiri/1863436/music
[1:03] <blaster> Thats why I want people to nominate
[1:03] <Visiiri> :D
[1:03] <whatdoesth> "some" sensible ones?
[1:03] <Naxza> Isn't that what the rest of the suggestions forum is aiming to do?
[1:03] <blaster> And remember it needs to be nominated twice
[1:03] <whatdoesth> If you want anyone to take it seriously, don't you think it should be nothing BUT sensible ones?
[1:03] <blaster> The suggestions forum is for suggesting stuff
[1:03] * Marach-14 is now known as Marafk-14
[1:03] <blaster> This is to decide what should be added first
[1:03] <Seiseki> the game is not in a stage where he's gonna add stuff that we ask for, perhaps in a few months when the technical stuff is worked out
[1:03] <whatdoesth> Even then, there's a certain amount of... players tend to not know what's good for a game.
[1:03] <Marafk-14> Hero Core... so addicting... must beat hard more
[1:03] <Marafk-14> sleep first
[1:04] <blaster> Visiiri is your suggestion more music?
[1:04] <Seiseki> that too, whatdoesth
[1:04] <Marafk-14> bye
[1:04] <Visiiri> Why the hell would notch add things we ask for>
[1:04] <vurtual> what is galcon fusion, Seiseki?
[1:04] <whatdoesth> What players want, and what's actually a GOOD addition to a game... usually unrelated.
[1:04] <Visiiri> blaster: My suggestion is ANAL SECKS
[1:04] <vurtual> basically what I said Visiiri?

[1:05] <Visiiri> blaster: Perhaps time pausing?
[1:05] <vurtual> app store?
[1:05] <Visiiri> AND THE REWIND

[1:06] <Visiiri> blaster: TIME pausing
[1:06] <Visiiri> You press a button and everything freezes!
[1:06] <Visiiri> And rewind
[1:06] <Visiiri> and fast forward
[1:06] <blaster> Visiiri unless there is a forum thread for that its too complex
[1:06] <blaster> And it seems kind of odd
[1:06] <Visiiri> :\ Haven't you ever played Timeshift?
[1:06] <Naxza> And SpaceCraft and RapeCraft aren't?
[1:06] <Seiseki> vurtual it's not just for the iphone and ipad
[1:06] <blaster> No
[1:07] <Seiseki> notice the windows/mac/linux icons :P
[1:07] <blaster> Spacecraft and rapecraft are straightforward ideas
[1:07] <Visiiri> Seiseki neither is child porn
[1:07] <whatdoesth> ...
[1:07] <Naxza> You want to try coding them?
[1:07] <blaster> But time pausing would need a thread to explain it
[1:07] <Visiiri> blaster: how about this:
[1:07] <Seiseki> uh youre point?
[1:07] <Seiseki> *your
[1:07] <Visiiri> VCR Time Controlling Device
[1:07] <whatdoesth> Yeah... don't complain about people not taking your poll seriously.
[1:07] <Visiiri> Does that make sense?

[1:07] * Visiiri rewinds
[1:07] * Visiiri shoots vurtual in the past
[1:07] * Visiiri fast forwards
[1:08] <blaster> But unless a second person nominates it wont be added to poll
[1:08] <vurtual> Well finally got that bb gun bruise healing
[1:08] <vurtual> vis did
[1:08] <blaster> So, any other nominations?

[1:26] <Snowman> blaster, agreed
[1:26] <LG_Legacy> I know 'most' issues.
[1:26] <hyperhopper> when survival updates, will it be indev or infdev?
[1:26] <AzureAngelic> visiiri, if there's an underground vatican chapel there should be pedophiliac axotols as well
[1:26] <LG_Legacy> hyperhopper It's fine.

[1:39] <blaster> Knuk what is the best suggestion of what to add to minecraft of all time?
[1:39] <Knuk> I created a server on my computer, and I tried to connect to it from my sister's computer
[1:39] <DrakeHiggins> blaster, not now
[1:39] <Knuk> but it didn't worked
[1:39] <DrakeHiggins> Are your ports open?
[1:39] <blaster> Its coz he on same network
[1:39] <Yourself> don't need to be open on a LAN
[1:39] <Knuk> that's means the problem is from my computer or from the router?
[1:39] <blaster> not gona work ever
[1:40] <blaster> I dont think minecraft works on lan
[1:40] <DrakeHiggins> If it's the same network, I know there is a way to make it work.
[1:40] <Yourself> you need to add &override=true to the link
[1:40] <Visiiri> blaster: "max connections"
[1:40] <Knuk> it did the classic server is probably down error
[1:40] <Visiiri> That defines the amount of people that can connect from one IP
[1:40] <Visiiri> so increase that
[1:40] <Knuk> it's 3

[1:54] <DrakeHiggins> A real good suggestion list would be made with care and take time.

[2:54] <blaster> Your feild of view is 1d

[2:55] <Snowman> Dude, I know
[2:55] <Snowman> Oh btw
[2:55] <blaster> Thinking in 2d is realy entertaining
[2:55] <Snowman> That site is so ripped

[4:35] <Naxza> It then connects to the internet and uploads your score if yours is the highest for the map/wad.

[4:55] <Skillkills> Oh wow
[4:56] <Skillkills> I just got a message from this faggot on Myyearbook.com
[4:56] <Skillkills> saying "http://lifeandrulesofanarchy.yolasite.com/ want to join"
[4:56] <Skillkills> He doesn't even fucking know what anarchy is....
[4:56] <killer2329> no gov
[4:56] <AlexVMiner> >:D
[4:56] <vede> It sounds like it might be cool so obviously you should believe it's best, right?
[4:56] <Skillkills> xD
[4:57] <CrazySpai> I love how Anarchist come together to accomplish a goal, however that goes against their main belief.
[4:57] <vede> Isn't that how philosophy works?
[4:57] <Skillkills> This fucker cant even structure a sentence properly
[4:57] <killer2329> anonymous the only anarchy
[4:57] <vede> CrazySpai, people working together isn't necessarily anti-anarchy.
[4:57] <Skillkills> Check out the site... lmfao
[4:57] <CrazySpai> However, when they form as a group with a hierarchy and leadership it does.
[4:57] <Skillkills> vede, Someone has to lead it
[4:58] <killer2329> no
[4:58] <vede> Anti-anarchy would be a bunch of people coming together and creating a set of rules and punishing people for breaking them.
[4:58] <killer2329> go look at project chanology
[4:58] <CrazySpai> The most prominant anarchist group in the 30's had president and it's own laws.
[4:58] <Skillkills> I would rather not, it has the word chan in it.... that tells me STAY AWAY
[4:58] <vede> That's pretty hilarious.
[4:58] <CrazySpai> They called themselves anarchists, however they were far from it.
[4:58] <Konogan> That's weird... 50 tabs in IE and it only uses 50 mb...
[4:59] <Skillkills> xD
[4:59] <CrazySpai> Are they blank tabs?
[4:59] <killer2329> project chanology was just anti Co$
[4:59] <Skillkills> Get firefoc
[4:59] <Skillkills> firefox*
[4:59] <CrazySpai> Each tab of mine had a minimum of 6 images, 2 dynamic content and a decent bit of text (which doesn't mean shit)
[4:59] <Konogan> I have the firey fox, just testing.
[4:59] <killer2329> it was a complete anarchy

[5:05] <fenixfurion> they're interconnected/whatever
[5:05] <killer2329> >.< wtf am i downloading i wana play doom 2 allready
[5:05] <Naxza> I was just saying vanilla because it's the flat-out simplest to set up.
[5:05] <fenixfurion> you need to have doom
[5:05] <Skillkills> The worst he can do is report me, then he will still get in trouble cuz his original post was advertising, bad advertising at that

[6:07] <RaidSoft> sounds damn messy to eat?
[6:07] <EmpiresBane> not really
[6:07] <vede> RaidSoft, you use actual utensils for that kind of thing.
[6:07] <EmpiresBane> i used my hands...
[6:07] <vede> O_o
[6:07] <Visiiri> They have greasy as shit burgers, but they're soooo good.
[6:07] <vede> The bun-less burgers I've seen would have practically exploded if you used your hands.

[6:08] <Visiiri> + a side of haystack onions
[6:08] <vede> They were bun-less because when you picked it up the bun would just fall apart and you'd end up with burger-soup on a plate.
[6:09] <Ptero> That sounds ewie.
[6:09] <RaidSoft> Usually those types are "fancy" burgers, stuff you don't get at KFC :P

[6:12] <Ptero> Aw. Why not?
[6:12] <RaidSoft> I don't like it as much anymore after eating pretty much nothing except pizza for a few months :P
[6:13] <EmpiresBane> i ate a family sized pizza in under 10 minutes once
[6:13] <EmpiresBane> i wasn't even paying attention
[6:13] <EmpiresBane> that was probably my worst crap ever
[6:13] <Ptero> I've got a thing for deep dish/stuffed crust pizza.
[6:13] <Ptero> Soooo good.
[6:14] <RaidSoft> thin crusted pizza is pretty much the standard here
[6:14] <EmpiresBane> i hate when the sauce is oozing out onto the crust
[6:14] <RaidSoft> and thick crust pizzas are american pizzas :P
[6:14] <Ptero> I don't like thin, I actually like the crusts on pizza.
[6:14] <Ptero> Ah, well I am American!
[6:14] <Shori> thin crust is kinda gross
[6:14] <EmpiresBane> oh hey! i can play infdev again
[6:14] <Ptero> Why couldn't you before?
[6:14] <RaidSoft> I prefer the topping being the highlight of the meal and not the bread ;P
[6:15] <RaidSoft> thin crust is only gross if the topping is gross
[6:15] <RaidSoft> and then you have a shitty pizza maker
[6:15] <Ptero> For me, the topping is just an addition of flavor!
[6:15] <Ptero> Yeah, I hate it when it's not made right.
[6:15] <EmpiresBane> the lag was unbearable before
[6:15] <RaidSoft> but I have always found it weird how you see in movies where they order a pizza and everyone is like sharing slices
[6:15] <RaidSoft> I would eat that whole thing myself
[6:15] <Ptero> But at least it's not made by a machine.
[6:16] <RaidSoft> always like that in american movies :P

[6:16] <Ptero> Hah!
[6:16] <Ptero> I got for like 4-6
[6:16] <Ptero> go*
[6:16] <RaidSoft> a meal is pretty much always a whole pizza here
[6:16] <RaidSoft> well at least for me
[6:16] <ClassiestMedic> is any of you skilled in OMEN?
[6:17] <Ptero> Aha, but they are thinner.
[6:17] <RaidSoft> yea
[6:17] <ClassiestMedic> um
[6:17] <ClassiestMedic> how would I add veins
[6:17] <RaidSoft> and they are HUGE
[6:17] <RaidSoft> like massive in size
[6:17] <ClassiestMedic> of gold ore or diamond ore or whatevs
[6:17] <Plus-san> http://images.4chan.org/v/src/1272939416373.jpg last screenshot before my game crashed
[6:17] <Ptero> Sorry, no clue =[
[6:17] <EmpiresBane> wow... 50 cloth from one group of sheep
[6:17] <RaidSoft> ofc varies between pizzerias, but most of the places they are massive :)

[6:21] <RaidSoft> Ptero: http://www.geting.se/images/2/200416-pizza.JPG there you have approximate sizes on a "normal" sized pizza
[6:21] <RaidSoft> though it looks like they have bad choices of toppings
[6:21] <RaidSoft> :P
[6:22] <outsomnia> "french fry pizza" I'm sorry, what?
[6:22] <Shori> that looks delicious and disgusting at the same time.

[6:31] <Yourself> technically it could, but it doesn't since this kind of linear fog is standardized
[6:31] <Malikat> yeah
[6:31] <EmpiresBane> how long does it take for a tree to grow
[6:31] <Ptero> I think about a full day.
[6:32] <Malikat> if the graphics card handled opengl in a radically altered way, it could change things
[6:32] <Ptero> In the daylight.
[6:32] <Malikat> but that would be WEIRD.
[6:32] <Ptero> Trees can grow with just torchlight, though. Has to be close to the torch.
[6:32] <Ptero> Or so I think.
[6:32] <Malikat> that's what your mom said

[6:36] <EmpiresBane> infdev
[6:36] <Ptero> Did you try a fogging it up?
[6:36] <EmpiresBane> yes
[6:36] <EmpiresBane> i always have fog on. trust me, it's a distance thing
[6:36] <EmpiresBane> i tested it
[6:37] <Ptero> I know I can't run anything else other than infdev when playing it or I lag hard.
[6:37] <Ptero> Well, IRC is fine.
[6:37] <EmpiresBane> and it didn't happen until Notch optimized it
[6:37] <Ptero> Maybe it will get optioptimized!

[6:40] <Ptero> You need a wooden pickaxe at least, to get stone.
[6:40] <Malikat> yeah, if you dig with an understrength tool, you don't get the resource
[6:40] <leBMD> if a game about cutesy animals gave you a stiffy, I'm scared.
[6:40] <Malikat> need wood for coal / stone, stone for iron, iron for gold / diamond
[6:40] <EmpiresBane> that's really retarded
[6:41] <Malikat> not really
[6:41] <Malikat> you used to not even be able to break the block if you had an understrength tool

[6:58] <Ptero> Floating islands ftw.
[6:58] <williamdh> and realistically people wont run into the depth limitation for the most part unless they are just tunneling randomly so its likely that notch will focus on things that matter alot more to actual gameplay rather than something with so much work involved
[6:59] <Ptero> I want floating islands in infdev =[
[6:59] * Shori (KamaroHito@199.2.122.109) has joined #minecraft
[7:00] <williamdh> id imagine he could make it taller easier than deeper and in fact do both without to much of a performance hit once hes optimized things more
[7:00] <EmpiresBane> his idea was to do height dynamicly or something
[7:00] <Malikat> oh shit
[7:01] <Malikat> i just did a 3d flood fill on omen
[7:01] <Malikat> and now my computer is making overheat alarms
[7:01] <williamdh> the idea for future implementation that im most interested in is the varied environment one
[7:01] <williamdh> forests, seas, deserts and even hells as places you can travel to
[7:01] <Dman757> I made my own floating islands in infdev
[7:02] <Ptero> I had that idea too, william!
[7:02] <Ptero> So awesome.
[7:02] <williamdh> itd be interesting if difficulty varied over areas too
[7:02] <Malikat> oh damnit omen
[7:02] <Ptero> Woah. Go look at that tumblr page of his and ctrl+f "ptero". Hahhh.
[7:02] <williamdh> well i didnt exactly "ave that idea" its something that notch is planing
[7:02] <Ptero> Same idea.
[7:02] <Ptero> Oh.
[7:02] <Ptero> Well
[7:02] <EmpiresBane> anyways. it was gonna have each column of chunks keep track of the height
[7:02] <Ptero> That's even sweeter.

[7:05] <EmpiresBane> so that towers and such would be possble
[7:05] <EmpiresBane> and building on the mountains
[7:05] <williamdh> though just the idea of being able to find a chunk of hell on infdev with endless swarms of monsters sounds interesting to me, anyone who could brave the danger would be tough to attack by other players
[7:05] <Ptero> So, has anyone tried jump-tile spamming to see the height limit on infdev?
[7:05] <williamdh> it makes sense that above ground lighting is easier then below

[7:06] <williamdh> you dont even need that ptero its not that high, ive found mountains near the limit
[7:06] <Visiiri> Ptero: It's not really that high.
[7:06] <Ptero> =O
[7:06] <Visiiri> Not only that, but you can buld three blocks out of it.
[7:07] <Visiiri> And when you delete one of these said blocks, your game, browser, and possibly computer crash!
[7:07] <Ptero> What do you mean three blocks out of it?
[7:07] <williamdh> its weird having clouds pass through you
[7:07] <Ptero> Oh. 8I
[7:07] <Visiiri> Three blocks above the clouds.
[7:07] <Ptero> Scary.
[7:07] <EmpiresBane> Visiiri, you can still do that?
[7:07] <EmpiresBane> i thought he fixed it
[7:08] <Ptero> I did the dumbest thing ever. Changed an mclevel extension to .lvl and tried to load it, lol.
[7:08] <Ptero> Crashed my computer.
[7:08] <Kawa> GJ
[7:08] <williamdh> if he does increase the height like empire said it would be interesting if notch kept some low clouds
[7:08] <Visiiri> http://dailycasual.com/?p=236
[7:08] <Ptero> I always thought that was cool in floating islands, being above the clouds.
[7:08] <Visiiri> linkz
[7:08] <williamdh> the idea of looking down from your base with clouds below you just seems cool to me

[7:36] <ThomasBags> well thing is, I already made it a mile long
[7:36] <ThomasBags> the normal way
[7:36] <ThomasBags> and ive been digging a staircase down it
[7:36] <ThomasBags> so its like tons of blocks deep, mile long
[7:37] <ThomasBags> I experimented with ce and got 14 levels done
[7:37] <Malikat> i'm not even sure how i'd use cheat engine to speed up digging
[7:37] <Malikat> however you're not supposed to talk about hacking the game in the channel
[7:37] <ThomasBags> taking out that part where i hold W and M1 for an hour
[7:37] <ThomasBags> hm i guess
[7:38] <ThomasBags> still, its interesting
[7:38] <Malikat> you dug a 1600 block long tunnel?

[7:39] <EmpiresBane> i thought a mile was 1609.2 meters?
[7:40] <ThomasBags> how many blocks does a double chest hold
[7:40] <ThomasBags> cause i've filled 4 of them
[7:40] <ClassiestMedic> er
[7:40] <ClassiestMedic> a lot?
[7:40] <TrueWolves> XD
[7:40] <ThomasBags> lol
[7:40] <ThomasBags> so 64 times a lot
[7:40] <TrueWolves> how would you /transport/ that?
[7:40] <ThomasBags> thats deep too btw
[7:40] <ThomasBags> im gonna build a mega castle above me
[7:40] <ThomasBags> right now i live in a mud hiut
[7:41] <ThomasBags> made by a creeper
[7:41] <TrueWolves> someone needs to build the wall of china
[7:41] <ThomasBags> I decided to make home where he blew up
[7:41] <ThomasBags> lol I can probably
[7:41] <TrueWolves> make a 1kilo meter by 1 kilo meter area with torchs so no enemies can spawn, then build a whole city
[7:41] <EmpiresBane> i think a double chest has 60 slots
[7:41] <EmpiresBane> no wait
[7:42] <EmpiresBane> 6*9
[7:42] <TrueWolves> 54
[7:42] <EmpiresBane> 54*4
[7:42] <ThomasBags> 12,824 blocks
[7:42] * Firetempest (Mibbit@adsl-235-74-36.clt.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:43] <TrueWolves> so he has about 50k blocks
[7:43] <TrueWolves> or in other words
[7:43] <TrueWolves> Enough blocks to make a line 50 kilometers long.
[7:43] <PoF59[DS]> (54*4)60(theres 60 per stack, right?)
[7:43] <EmpiresBane> i got 14904 when i did the math
[7:43] <EmpiresBane> 64 in a stack
[7:43] <Firetempest> 64
[7:43] <PoF59[DS]> ah.
[7:43] <ThomasBags> 64
[7:44] <TrueWolves> 384,403,000 blocks
[7:44] <ThomasBags> christ why do i always have more iron than coal
[7:44] <EmpiresBane> what?
[7:44] <TrueWolves> if you can get that many, you could build a pilar to the moon
[7:44] <PoF59[DS]> wow.
[7:44] <EmpiresBane> you did some math wrong
[7:44] <ThomasBags> yea
[7:44] <TrueWolves> That wasn't how many he had
[7:44] * TylerP223 (kvirc@75.136.26.124) has joined #minecraft
[7:44] <EmpiresBane> 6*9 = 54
[7:44] <TrueWolves> That's how many it would take to get to the moon
[7:44] <EmpiresBane> 54*4 = 216
[7:44] <ThomasBags> whats always cool is when you make a tunnel so long the fog catches up with you
[7:45] <EmpiresBane> 216*64 = 13824
[7:45] <EmpiresBane> he has 13,824 blocks
[7:45] * TylerP223 (kvirc@75.136.26.124) has left #minecraft
[7:46] <EmpiresBane> not 384 million
[7:46] <Firetempest> that would be one amazing block game if it let you make a tower to the moon. orbital block stations. where is that warp core block...
[7:46] <ThomasBags> lol
[7:46] <ThomasBags> but the moon moves
[7:46] <Malikat> i wonder how long it would take to fall from the moon
[7:47] <ThomasBags> WHY IS THERE ONLY 1 15 MIN FLAPJACK EPISODE A WEEK
[7:47] <Malikat> someone use NBTedit to set your height that high
[7:47] <Firetempest> doesn't have to be earth
[7:47] <ThomasBags> but you couldnt really fall from the moon
[7:47] <TrueWolves> FOR THE LAST TIME
[7:47] <vede> Yeah the moontower only works a couple weeks every year.
[7:47] <Malikat> well, duh
[7:47] <TrueWolves> 384 MILLION is how much it takes to get to the moon
[7:47] <vede> All the other times it just kinda leads to void.
[7:47] <TrueWolves> I wasn't calculating how many he had guys. =/
[7:47] <Malikat> hmm
[7:48] <vede> Hm.
[7:48] <Firetempest> alright, forget the tower. dyson sphere.
[7:48] <vede> I wonder how many blocks there would be in a fully-generated world.
[7:48] <EmpiresBane> well, you kinda said it in a weird spot
[7:48] <TrueWolves> I did
[7:48] <TrueWolves> my fault there.
[7:48] <Malikat> not even unrestricted infdev has enough space to make a dyson's sphere
[7:48] <EmpiresBane> vede, notch said at one point
[7:48] <EmpiresBane> it's too big for the human mind to fully coprehend, though
[7:48] <vede> EmpiresBane, I know he's said the distances and filesizes and all that, but a block-count?
[7:49] <EmpiresBane> yeah
[7:49] <ThomasBags> whats the most diamond someone's found in infdev?
[7:49] <Malikat> you could make a ringworld at about midway between mercury and venus
[7:49] <ThomasBags> most ive seen is like, 10 blocks
[7:49] <Firetempest> well, the main drawback to any of these ideas is the game engine is a flat plain.
[7:49] <Malikat> it wouldn't be a very THICK ringworld
[7:50] <Malikat> in the original theoretical size of infinite maps, you could fit the orbit of mercury in the map, to scale
[7:50] <Firetempest> http://sealwyf.wikispaces.com/file/view/DysnSphr.gif/33563317/DysnSphr.gif

[8:03] <JacobR248> Can't register a prepaid debit card on Paypal, blah blah blah.
[8:03] <JacobR248> Is there like a direct payment option?
[8:03] <JacobR248> Without Paypal?
[8:03] <Shadaez> don't register it, just pay it through paypal without an account
[8:03] <JacobR248> I did that.
[8:03] <JacobR248> Did the same thing.
[8:03] <JacobR248> Any other way?
[8:03] <EmpiresBane> and no, there is no direct payment
[8:03] <JacobR248> So that's it?
[8:03] <JacobR248> Only Paypal?
[8:03] <EmpiresBane> yeah

[8:04] <FoxtrotZero> Gentlemen
[8:04] <EmpiresBane> notch tried something else for awhile, but it was terrible
[8:04] <Shadaez> Log into the gift cards website and change the address and stuff
[8:04] <Konogan> Why people don't like paypal?
[8:04] <JacobR248> I did all that.
[8:04] <JacobR248> Paypal is a pain for me.
[8:04] <Shadaez> how much is the giftcard worth
[8:04] <JacobR248> It doesn't like me using prepaid debit cards.
[8:04] <FoxtrotZero> Anyway, I can't figure out what to do at the beginning of indev...
[8:04] <JacobR248> It's worth 50 bucks.
[8:04] <JacobR248> I'll just give Notch the whole card if I can get registered.
[8:04] <EmpiresBane> build shit, FoxtrotZero
[8:04] <FoxtrotZero> You're unhelpful
[8:05] <FoxtrotZero> I can';t build shit without materials
[8:05] <JacobR248> So yeah, how did you ask Shadez?
[8:05] <Konogan> Got to go guys.
[8:05] <Konogan> Bye.
[8:05] <Malikat> genitalmen
[8:05] * Konogan is now known as Konogan|AFK
[8:05] <EmpiresBane> start by getting some wood
[8:05] <EmpiresBane> make a pickaxe
[8:05] <EmpiresBane> get some stone
[8:05] <EmpiresBane> make a stone pickaxe
[8:05] <FoxtrotZero> Do I just keep hitting the tree, because that didn't seem to do anything...
[8:06] <JacobR248> You know how I can come into contact with Notch?
[8:06] <EmpiresBane> hold down the mouse button
[8:06] <JacobR248> Maybe email him?
[8:06] <FoxtrotZero> ahh
[8:06] <Visiiri> How can I improve my L4D2 ping?
[8:06] <EmpiresBane> clicking it a lot does nothing
[8:06] <Shadaez> I can't imagine it not working
[8:06] <Visiiri> I am constantly over 1000 and it's impossible to play.
[8:06] <EmpiresBane> buy FiOS?
[8:06] <Shadaez> it's called fiber optics
[8:07] <Shadaez> FiOS is some crappy word made by verizon
[8:07] <Malikat> Visiiri: are you on satellite?
[8:07] <Visiiri> No sir.
[8:07] <EmpiresBane> FiOS is the brand for Verizon
[8:07] <EmpiresBane> so... i used the correct term
[8:07] <Malikat> there's a command in l4d that will set the maximum ping for a server when you start a game, presumably it's in l4d2 also
[8:08] <EmpiresBane> he doesn't want to get kicked cuz his ping is too high...

[8:09] <FoxtrotZero> How do I get a workbench?

[12:24] <Firetempest> ive have zero problems with vista 64, other then a few nagging admin requests
[12:24] <Speljohan_> i had no problems with vista after the service pack
[12:24] <Speljohan_> it's just like it will always be with windows
[12:24] <Azathoth> 1, 2, 3, 95, 98, Me, XP, Vista, 7
[12:24] <Speljohan_> shit in the beginning
[12:25] <Azathoth> and tehn there were some funky ones in between
[12:25] <Speljohan_> windows 96 was cool
[12:25] <Azathoth> like NT and 2000
[12:25] <liq3> Speljohan_: lol i suck. Only 7 million. :(
[12:25] <Azathoth> oh and there's CE

[12:39] <Dommys> Azathoth, they were replaced by 20gb drives, and were put on our "tech rack" to be sold at auction which usually never happened, as the shop teacher would pilfer the rack tri-annualy to upgrade his "gaming rig"
[12:39] <Azathoth> that's a pretty big price drop per gb in 6 freakin years

[12:42] <Parthon> because half the time kids weren't allowed near the phone anyways

[13:00] <Firetempest> wow got me started in mmos. it was pretty easy to start. and that was fine by me. but its even easier now to the point of why bother making people "lvl up" since they still wont learn to group tell max lvl. so i quit.
[13:00] <Dommys> Wow wasn't terrible at launch..
[13:00] <Speljohan_> for an uo player it was
[13:00] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:00] <GoaLitiuM> original wow was <3
[13:01] <Azathoth> the social aspects of WoW seem really fucking lame
[13:01] <GoaLitiuM> but when first expansion came...
[13:01] <Dommys> I enjoyed it for a few months
[13:01] <Azathoth> people treat it more like a job or something
[13:01] <Speljohan_> bound items, shitty economy, gear based progression
[13:01] <Dommys> Then it got head explodey
[13:01] <Speljohan_> enemies of real mmos
[13:01] <Azathoth> OK GUYS LETS MEET EVERY TUESDAY AT 7 TO RUN THIS QUEST
[13:01] <Azathoth> UNTIL THEN PRACTICE YOUR STRATS
[13:01] <Azathoth> WE NEED TO GET THAT DPS OUT THERE
[13:01] <Dommys> lol
[13:01] <Azathoth> fuck that. i want a real cooperative experience
[13:01] <Dommys> Never been in a raiding guild :D
[13:01] <Azathoth> not more work to do
[13:01] <Dommys> I raided in EQ, but never in a steady guild.
[13:02] <Dommys> We threw together what we could muster, and tried to wing it
[13:02] <Dommys> 50 players raiding one mob.. and getting their asses handed to them. lol
[13:02] <Speljohan_> work is fun if you accomplish something long term
[13:02] <Speljohan_> eg make 9999999999 money
[13:02] * Superwafflez (jbrand@CPE-121-222-229-227.lnse2.woo.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[13:02] <Speljohan_> and everything is purchasable
[13:03] <Dommys> Speljohan_ friend of mine, we got his father into eq.. and he's the sorta guy who never quits something once he likes it
[13:03] <Dommys> Played eq non stop from like, 2001 till last year
[13:03] <Dommys> And when he was bored/tired
[13:03] <Speljohan_> lool
[13:03] <Dommys> Had his character stand in a safe area, "foraging"
[13:03] <Azathoth> i want to play a good sci fi fps
[13:03] <Azathoth> err
[13:03] <Dommys> every minute you get a chance to "pick up" food, fruit, drinks whatever
[13:03] <Azathoth> mmo*
[13:03] <Dommys> And certain areas had other shit that could be foraged
[13:04] <Dommys> Like a ruins, you might forage a necklace, or something
[13:04] <Dommys> Or a broken weapon
[13:04] <Dommys> Some of that shit ended up being valuable
[13:04] <Speljohan_> there has only been one really good sci-fi mmo
[13:04] <Speljohan_> and that was star was galaxies pre-all the bullshit
[13:04] <Dommys> Anyways, in the long run, he ended up with over 500million in game currency
[13:04] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:04] <Azathoth> meh. swg
[13:04] <Firetempest> I tried LotR online. it was interesting yet never grabbed me.
[13:04] <Speljohan_> lotro is yet another boring grindclone
[13:04] <Dommys> There was not ANYTHING even remotely near putting a dent in that pocketbook
[13:04] <Azathoth> maybe this 40k mmo will be decent
[13:04] <Azathoth> but it will probably just be another fuckin wow clone
[13:05] <Dommys> I played Galaxies pre CU
[13:05] <Speljohan_> don't expect anything good Azathoth
[13:05] <Speljohan_> ye
[13:05] <Speljohan_> ye Dommys
[13:05] <Azathoth> like warhammer online
[13:05] * Superwafflez (jbrand@CPE-121-222-229-227.lnse2.woo.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[13:05] <Speljohan_> new mmo's just focus on making money the first month
[13:05] <Speljohan_> it's like
[13:05] <Azathoth> i played WAR for a few weeks
[13:05] <Dommys> Mind sniping Krayt Dragons for hours
[13:05] <Dommys> Oh yes
[13:05] <Azathoth> and then i realized i was just playing WoW again
[13:05] <Azathoth> so i quit
[13:05] <Speljohan_> 500k sales + 1 month of payment for each acc
[13:05] <Firetempest> when i first heard warhammer was going to be a mmo. my first thought was 40k. i was so disappointed it wasn't 40k
[13:05] <Speljohan_> and it has paid their expenses
[13:05] <Speljohan_> then they dont care anymore
[13:06] <Dommys> EVE isn't TERRIBLE.
[13:06] <Azathoth> EVE looks pretty good
[13:06] <Speljohan_> eve isn't bad except i hate time-based progression
[13:06] <Azathoth> but i'd prefer a third or first person sci fi mmo
[13:06] <Speljohan_> and i'm not a big space-fan
[13:06] <GoaLitiuM> ah eve
[13:06] <Azathoth> as opposed to space ships
[13:06] <Dommys> Spel yeah, starting late after everyone is hard.. but they make it pretty decent for a NEWB to be worthwhile to a group
[13:06] <Speljohan_> needs moar first person mmo's
[13:06] <Azathoth> first person MMOs just don't work very well
[13:07] <Speljohan_> lies
[13:07] <Dommys> That and, the best way to get cash, is Mining.. and that shit is boring as fuck all
[13:07] <GoaLitiuM> i have tried eve trial like ten times...
[13:07] <Azathoth> because they require way more bandwidth and stuff
[13:07] <GoaLitiuM> but never got into it
[13:07] <Speljohan_> that's a fucking terrible excuse though Azathoth
[13:07] <Azathoth> not really
[13:07] <GoaLitiuM> the concept itself looks nice
[13:07] <Speljohan_> it's a dumb excuse used by lazy developers
[13:07] <Dommys> How the hell does it matter what view your pc renders the area from?
[13:07] <Dommys> The data coming down the pipes is the same
[13:07] <Azathoth> i don't know what the tick rate is for a standard MMO, but i know it's a hell of a lot slower than what would be needed for smooth FPS movement
[13:07] <Speljohan_> hell, they always complain about not being able to do non-instanced housing/item dropping on the floor due to bandwidth and cpu
[13:07] <Speljohan_> yet UO did it in 1996
[13:07] <Speljohan_> with no trouble
[13:08] <Speljohan_> loll
[13:08] <Dommys> mob_x: location x13, y150
[13:08] <Azathoth> or combat rather
[13:08] <Firetempest> EVE is the only mmo i'm currently playing. I like finding a new wormhole and poping out in nul sec to be chased by Russians.
[13:08] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:08] <Azathoth> since in an FPS you physically aim your attacks rather than targeting
[13:08] <Speljohan_> i have a mad friend who has 3 accounts Firetempest
[13:08] <Dommys> I played Endless Ages when it came out
[13:09] <Dommys> It was amazing
[13:09] <Azathoth> there needs to be a smooth response time, and also the server will need to do tons of ray traces for shots and stuff
[13:09] <Dommys> Err. in beta
[13:09] <Dommys> Then the retail was terrible
[13:09] <GoaLitiuM> combat in eve is hell booring
[13:09] <Dommys> Why they changed so much was beyond me
[13:09] <Firetempest> i have 3 too, but i play for them though game money
[13:09] <Firetempest> pay*
[13:09] <Dommys> GoaLitiuM, it depends on what you're flying with/against buddy
[13:09] <GoaLitiuM> the only thing i didn't like much
[13:09] <Dommys> I've been in insane firefights
[13:10] <Dommys> Guild Wars also.. Amazing in Beta, released was terrible
[13:10] <Speljohan_> i am not expecting any good mmo to be released in the upcoming 10-15 years or so
[13:10] <Dommys> They literally changed the game world so much between beta and retail I hated it
[13:10] <Speljohan_> it's a dead and oversaturated market
[13:10] <Azathoth> only good thing about GW is that it's free to play
[13:10] <Speljohan_> it's not an mmo tho
[13:10] <Dommys> I always say "I'm gonna buy the GW Trilogy"
[13:10] <GoaLitiuM> instanced rpg
[13:10] <Dommys> And then I remember, I hate it.
[13:11] <Dommys> lol
[13:11] <Azathoth> it's not?
[13:11] <Speljohan_> ye GoaLitiuM
[13:11] <Speljohan_> but then
[13:11] <Speljohan_> pretty much all so called mmorpgs are turning into instanced multiplayer rpgs
[13:11] <Speljohan_> minimal effort, maximum instant gratification
[13:11] <Dommys> Planetside was an interesting concept of FPS+MMO
[13:11] <Dommys> But was wayyy to limiting
[13:11] <Speljohan_> it worked quite well imo Dommys
[13:11] <Dommys> It was like Tribes but with a giant ass map and a lot more people
[13:11] <Azathoth> planetside looked fun
[13:12] <Azathoth> never played it
[13:12] <Dommys> It was for awhile.. but then, Capping bases turned boring
[13:12] <Speljohan_> i played the 72 day trial i got from pc gamer
[13:12] <Speljohan_> :D
[13:12] <Firetempest> I hope DUST for EVE is finished some day.
[13:12] <Dommys> Stealthing around stabbing the shit out of people was a blast though
[13:12] <Dommys> Wayyy better than Spy TF2
[13:12] <Dommys> Because it meant something there
[13:12] <Speljohan_> all fps's turn boring quickly though
[13:12] <Speljohan_> play one, you've played them all prty much
[13:12] <Speljohan_> and it's fun for about 1 hour
[13:12] <Dommys> When you got shanked in the back on planetside, there was a good chance you were in for a 10+ minute transit back to the frontlines
[13:13] * PyroCat is now known as Cat
[13:13] <Azathoth> i like FPSes with RPG elements
[13:13] <Firetempest> I want another No one lives forever game. that was some really funny stuff
[13:13] <Dommys> And the whole time your team is getting stomped
[13:13] <Azathoth> they tend to be more diverse
[13:13] <Dommys> STALKER?
[13:13] <Speljohan_> i prefer straight out rpgs
[13:13] <Speljohan_> like baldur's gate
[13:13] <Speljohan_> !
[13:13] <Azathoth> stalker was a bit of a disappointment but it was alright
[13:13] * Mithril (Mithril2@e54013.upc-e.chello.nl) has joined #minecraft
[13:13] <Firetempest> i got stalker for a few bucks during steam x-mas. it sucked. so many glitches.
[13:13] <Azathoth> but i really like deus ex and system shock 2 type games
[13:14] <Azathoth> never played SS1
[13:14] <Speljohan_> i prty much stopped playing game completely after 2004 or so
[13:14] <Speljohan_> with very few exceptions
[13:15] <Dommys> Really, I played the shit out of the Stalker series, and never saw a glitch at all
[13:15] <Dommys> I heard so much bad shit about it
[13:15] <Dommys> But never had an issue
[13:15] <Azathoth> but those games had interesting combinations of skills, inventory management, and straight up FPS gameplay that i liked
[13:15] <Dommys> Thought people were just full of shit
[13:15] <Dommys> lol
[13:15] <Dommys> Playing DF atm
[13:15] <Azathoth> stalker doesn't seem very glitchy to me
[13:15] <Azathoth> it just seem unpolished
[13:15] <Firetempest> i think its just the steam version. other apps ive d/l through steam were screwed up too
[13:15] <Azathoth> and not very well optimized
[13:15] * KodaichiZero (kodaichize@69.158.43.81) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[13:16] <Azathoth> it's the only game that causes my video card to overheat to the point of visible artifacts
[13:16] <Azathoth> and it doesn't even have very good graphics
[13:16] <GoaLitiuM> i should've bought eve from steam when it was like 5 euros >.<

[13:20] * Prototy (IceChat7@ip56573ca3.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft
[13:20] <Firetempest> its like RTS combat. a bit disconnected.
[13:20] <GoaLitiuM> are they going to change that standing system in upcoming expansion?
[13:22] <Firetempest> they are only changing player standing system to a less complex one. hate, neutral, like. compared to -10 to +10
[13:24] <Firetempest> some mineral/item changes and planet mining. thats about it for expansion
[13:24] * Shrimp3000 (shrimp_97@d122-111-48-147.mas17.nsw.optusnet.com.au) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

[13:58] <McC1oud> i made a nuke using omen
[13:58] <McC1oud> i wouldnt recomend it
[13:58] * Speljohan_ (had07josjo@192.165.96.21) Quit (Quit: L?mnar)
[13:59] <Roadcrosser> LEMME USE IT
[13:59] <vurtual> I can't believe people actually buy JC2 DLC.
[13:59] <Roadcrosser> I* WANNA MAKE A CRATER!
[14:00] <vurtual> unless they actual physically implement new functions.
[14:00] <vurtual> then they're nothing but shiny mods!
[14:00] <McC1oud> sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate. 3 new blocks needed in the game
[14:01] <vurtual> what are you implyiong
[14:01] <Plinky> And Salt Peter.
[14:01] <Plinky> XD
[14:01] <vurtual> are you implying bullets
[14:01] <McC1oud> no, so we have another source other then creepers
[14:01] <Plinky> Well, potassium nitrate is saltpeter
[14:02] <Plinky> But saltpeter is a better name :D
[14:02] <McC1oud> basically the nuke was just a 16x 16 block of tnt,
[14:02] <McC1oud> crash big time
[14:03] <Roadcrosser> yeah:/
[14:03] <Roadcrosser> knew that
[14:03] <Roadcrosser> LINK
[14:03] <vurtual> those rarely crash
[14:03] <vurtual> You're a bad pilot.
[14:04] <vurtual> Anyways minecrafters should be the first to invent explosion-driven railguns
[14:05] <McC1oud> we've heard talks about the ramps, do you think we'll ever see a round object?
[14:05] <McC1oud> ie a canonball
[14:05] <vurtual> Create a tube, other various parts, assmble in crafting, then craft an iron bar+gunpowder, and get a metal rod with gunpowder in the end. Craft 4 bars and a gunpowder to make a huge amount of firing caps, add one to metal rod.
[14:06] * Snowman (Snowman@sd51100a0.adsl.wanadoo.nl) has joined #minecraft
[14:06] <vurtual> Then, craft together the weapon and the round, and you load it. Then, you can fire this. Reload and repeat.
[14:06] <Snowman> hELLO
[14:06] <Snowman> Whoops
[14:06] <McC1oud> hi
[14:07] <McC1oud> The topic is...: Gunpowder and nukes
[14:07] <Snowman> Nukes aren't made with gunpowder.
[14:08] <Plinky> Vurtual, explosion powered railguns...
[14:08] <Plinky> I want to slap you for that
[14:09] <McC1oud> hmm, were there any plans for scuba gear?
[14:09] <McC1oud> Have a new hazard in the game:radioactive material
[14:09] <vurtual> It's like a railgun in the sense that it gives you the effect of "solid metal slicing through things like flying sword"
[14:09] <vurtual> and it's explosion powered because it has the power of a whole tnt for it.
[14:10] <Plinky> But it isn't a railgun in the sense of being a railgun.
[14:10] <Plinky> XD
[14:10] <vurtual> it has rails on the inside
[14:10] <McC1oud> block of uranium that causes imminent damage
[14:10] <slowriot> well tbh
[14:10] <vurtual> It fires a small train.
[14:10] <slowriot> you could always use an explosive electric generator
[14:10] <slowriot> like a z-pinch
[14:10] <Plinky> >.<
[14:10] <slowriot> and hook that up to a railgun arrangement
[14:10] <slowriot> BZOOP
[14:10] <Plinky> Slowriot has a better idea
[14:10] <Plinky> XD
[14:10] <vurtual> No no I'd rather it charge via fission
[14:10] <Plinky> And replacing the rails after each shot.
[14:10] * aera (andrew@hydrae.aeracode.org) Quit (Excess Flood)
[14:10] <slowriot> why not fusion?
[14:11] <Plinky> Huge negative of railguns.
[14:11] <McC1oud> URANIUM!
[14:11] <slowriot> Plinky: replacing them? That's too much like hard work... why not fire the rails as well!
[14:11] * aera (andrew@hydrae.aeracode.org) has joined #minecraft
[14:11] <Plinky> They break the rails after the shots.
[14:11] <Plinky> Slowriot: They would be too damaged.
[14:11] <vurtual> So when it's low on energy, you have to load in a uranium thing, and then it-
[14:11] <vurtual> No wait, it could deplete the uranium really quickly to get enough power for firing.
[14:11] <slowriot> i mean, have them jettisoned as part of the cartridge, and load a new round rails and all
[14:11] <slowriot> rounds would be pretty big, mind
[14:12] <Plinky> That would be smart.
[14:12] <Plinky> But still takes a similar amount of time.
[14:12] <McC1oud> Recoil like in half life
[14:12] <vurtual> tau cannon has never been called a railgun
[14:12] <vurtual> faintly a gauss gun, but not a railgun
[14:12] <Plinky> People need to find a material for the rails that won't break itself
[14:12] <vurtual> it just fires flashy rape jetpack beams

[14:12] <slowriot> depends what you need, really
[14:12] <Plinky> Doesn't the Tau cannon fire electricity?
[14:12] <slowriot> copper rails can work quite well
[14:13] <vurtual> it uses depleted uranium
[14:13] <vurtual> for a nuclear reaction?
[14:13] <slowriot> if you give the round a graphite sabot type arrangement
[14:13] <McC1oud> wtf lol

[14:13] <Plinky> Copper would still be damaged if you overloaded it.
[14:13] <Plinky> Which would be a pain the behind.
[14:13] <slowriot> well, depends what the mechanism of damage is
[14:13] <Plinky> pain in the behind.*
[14:13] <vurtual> Like, I can't remember where but it was described as using depleted uranium as an energy source, instead of "the enriched isotope"
[14:14] <vurtual> So maybe the tau cannon literally charges itself from its rounds.
[14:14] <slowriot> if it's just a matter of carrying current, a 1" by 1" square copper rod can take a fuckload before overheating
[14:14] <vurtual> then sends them in some kind of energy-form or matter-form-but-small
[14:14] <slowriot> if it's a matter of pitting and oxidation by arc damage, then you just need a surface
[14:14] <slowriot> that's why graphite-boxed rounds do the job quite well
[14:14] * aera (andrew@hydrae.aeracode.org) Quit (Excess Flood)
[14:14] <McC1oud> Borox plated bolts
[14:14] <slowriot> a disposable square graphite casing with a hollow cylinder cutout, and the actual round in the cutout
[14:14] <Plinky> Yeah slow, but with the amount of charge you need, it would still get damaged.
[14:15] * aera (andrew@hydrae.aeracode.org) has joined #minecraft
[14:15] <Plinky> As in, to fire it over a distance.
[14:15] <slowriot> i dunno - if the graphite excludes oxygen, and can close the gap so there's no arcing, it also self-lubricates
[14:15] <vurtual> Aren't we throwing out the whole rail thing every shot though?
[14:15] <vurtual> OH HEY
[14:15] <Plinky> If it was a portable one, it might be too hard to do all this.
[14:15] <vurtual> Do it like the javelin
[14:15] <slowriot> well, you could just go the whole hog and have graphite rails and do away with the sabot
[14:15] <Plinky> Too expensive per round.
[14:16] <vurtual> Have the whoole barrel and lancher system detach from the reusable part.
[14:16] <McC1oud> Silly hats only
[14:16] <slowriot> each shot would utterly destroy the graphite rails, but they'd be lighter and cheaper to replace than copper ones
[14:16] <vurtual> Slap on a new one, fire.
[14:16] <Plinky> Yeah.
[14:16] <Plinky> Slowriot, not sure how the American railgun is setup right now though, they probably don't want to replace the rails.

[14:17] <vurtual> You act like America has just one railgun
[14:17] <vurtual> we have thousands of them.
[14:17] <Plinky> Vurtual, I'm reffering to a specific one.
[14:17] <vurtual> oh
[14:17] <vurtual> There's some special railgun that's specially American?

[14:17] <vurtual> The scary part is that this almost makes enough sense irl to actually build as a weapon for actual militaries.
[14:17] <Plinky> I will doubt I'll be able to find it.
[14:18] <slowriot> once when i was at school, me and a few friends started a railgun project
[14:18] <slowriot> it was quite serious stuff
[14:18] <vurtual> Maybe we could make them a cost-efficient weapon for elimination of light vehicles and neighborhood cats and walls.
[14:18] <Firetempest> I think chemical lasers are easier to field then a a rail.
[14:18] <vurtual> and make it work directly with the javelin system, so if you need to take out a light vehicle you can just snap a railgun on and blow it to shreds.
[14:19] <slowriot> we abandoned the project after realising how prohibitive the cost of bar copper stock was, rather than any concerns about capacitors etc
[14:19] <slowriot> each rail was going to cost over ??200 just in raw copper, which was more than we wanted to pay as school kids
[14:19] <Plinky> Ouch Slowriot.
[14:19] <slowriot> otherwise we had a theoretically attainable launch velocity of around the speed of sound with a 200g round
[14:20] * McC1oud (neon__fox@ppp118-208-132-153.lns20.bne1.internode.on.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[14:20] <slowriot> with just 1.2m long rails
[14:20] <slowriot> tbh, if i were to build an experimental weapon just now for laughs, it would defo be a laser
[14:21] <Plinky> I forgot the name of the one in development in the U.S. High velocity something rather.
[14:21] <slowriot> there's something so appealing about the idea of being able to aim through a window and pop car tyres outside
[14:21] <Plinky> It has 5 or 6 letters in the acronym.
[14:21] <Firetempest> id be happy with a blue laser phaser that can pop ballons
[14:22] <Firetempest> maybe propane filled ballons
[14:22] <AndrewPH> propane and propane accessories
[14:23] <vurtual> propane-based wasn't it
[14:23] <slowriot> for me it defo has to be car tyres :)

[14:23] <vurtual> no just propane and propane accessories
[14:23] <vurtual> Anyways you guys are thinking far too small.
[14:23] <slowriot> you could do it with something fairly low powered, less than 100W easily
[14:23] <slowriot> the important bit would be the focusing mechanism to get the most out of it
[14:23] <AndrewPH> I downloaded nusphere phped or whatever yesterday and I have nothing to do with it. I perfer notepad++ it doesn't make me lose all my ideas.
[14:24] <slowriot> why not use an SLR autofocus mechanism and lens to focus the beam optically on the point of contact?
[14:24] <slowriot> that's how i'd do it
[14:24] <AndrewPH> I'ma go cry myself to sleep now
[14:24] <Plinky> Slowriot, what is your opinion on electromagnetic catapults?
[14:24] <AndrewPH> afk
[14:24] <slowriot> Plinky: don't know much about them tbh, tell me more?
[14:25] <Plinky> System used to give spacecraft the speed to launch into space.
[14:25] <Plinky> Also know as a mass driver
[14:25] <vurtual> There's a specific point on my speaker volume percent
[14:25] <vurtual> which makes it sound unnervingly realistic
[14:26] <vurtual> and it includes a jump in the desk-shake, you can feel the air near the speakers moving too.
[14:26] <slowriot> ah right yes
[14:26] <slowriot> i prefer space elevators :)
[14:26] <slowriot> but that's just cos i'm an arthur c clarke fanboi
[14:26] <Plinky> They are cool.
[14:27] <Plinky> Have you seen the concepts for solar sails?
[14:27] <vurtual> I prefer a jet
[14:27] <vurtual> that just flies really high
[14:27] <Plinky> Jets cannot fly in space.
[14:27] <Plinky> :P
[14:27] <vurtual> and then you're like "TURN ON THE SPACE PROPULSION THING YEARR" once you'
[14:27] <vurtual> you've launched yourself into space. Because you moved so quickly, that your fighter was flung into space.
[14:28] <Plinky> Vurtual, huge problem with Jets, they used Jet engines.
[14:28] <Plinky> Jet engines are crap.
[14:28] <vurtual> Alternately, self-contained air.
[14:28] <vurtual> then, when you're in space
[14:28] <vurtual> antimatter thrust.
[14:28] <Plinky> Well, in terms of anything high in the atmosphere.
[14:28] <Firetempest> solar sails are fine, if you dont mind waiting half your life for it to get up to speed.
[14:28] <Plinky> Vurtual, you mean a rocket?
[14:28] <Plinky> Firetempest, depends on the size of the sail.
[14:29] <Plinky> Vurtual, rockets have onboard supplies on oxygens, jets do not.
[14:29] <vurtual> it flies like a jet, then once you get high enough, you can just use antimatter-based and other crazy stuff for getting moving quickly.
[14:29] <Plinky> Ion thruster would be better.
[14:29] <vurtual> a jet, that you pump air into. Like, you take some kind of modern equivelant of an F-22, and then slap an air compressor on it.
[14:29] <Plinky> Antimatter is dangerous obviously enough
[14:29] <vurtual> Then you stick a few other maneuvery functions that work in space. Then, antimatter engine, and fly anywhere you want.
[14:30] <Firetempest> would need to be a damn big sail. then you get to be one giant micro meteorite sponge
[14:30] <Plinky> Vurtual, you just want a rocket in that scenario, a jet engine with its own oxygen supply.
[14:30] <slowriot> ion thrusters have the same problems as solar sails
[14:30] <slowriot> very efficient, but take a damn long time to get going
[14:31] <slowriot> very poor actual thrust capacity
[14:31] <Plinky> Not if you pick up speed with a rocket.
[14:31] <slowriot> like a toyota prius ;)
[14:31] <vurtual> Can you use them to turn?
[14:31] <slowriot> well it's a thruster same as any other, but it still exudes a crappy amount of thrust whichever direction you point it in
[14:31] <vurtual> Make them turn!\
[14:31] <slowriot> so sure you can turn, but it still takes an age
[14:31] <Plinky> Pick up speed with the rocket, then switch over to thruster.
[14:31] <slowriot> er, newtonian mechanics anyone?
[14:31] <vurtual> Anyways antimatter space fighters.
[14:32] <vurtual> just add g diffuser.
[14:32] <Plinky> I hate people that play those cards/
[14:32] <Plinky> XD
[14:32] <slowriot> assuming antimatter was cheap enough to just scoop up by the handful and shove in a spaceship, the containment system required would have more deadweight than simply using normal reactive fuel
[14:32] <vurtual> and cannons like a WW2 fighter, but are actually belt-fed coilguns.
[14:33] <slowriot> get them to shoot through your space propeller!
[14:33] <vurtual> And we'll call them railguns anyways because "coilgun" doesn't sound as hardcore.
[14:33] <slowriot> scramjet biplane ;)
[14:33] <Plinky> Slowriot, exactly, it would be two inefficient.
[14:33] <Plinky> too*
[14:33] <vurtual> I thought it'd just be one inefficient.
[14:33] <Plinky> >.<
[14:33] <Firetempest> antimatterpunk
[14:33] <slowriot> btw, speaking of ramjets / scramjets, space isn't actually that empty when you go fast enough
[14:33] <vurtual> WARP SPEED AHEAD
[14:33] <vurtual> vwooooom
[14:33] <Plinky> Lol
[14:34] <vurtual> Then you have fightery intakes on the front, with nose art
[14:34] <slowriot> when you get to an appreciable portion of the speed of light, such as 1/20th or so, you begin to hit oxygen and hydrogen gas molecules with enough frequency to make scooping viable

[14:34] <vurtual> and they suck up hydrogens
[14:34] <vurtual> Here's this craazy idea guys.
[14:34] <vurtual> We have to use magnets to contain antimatter right? Electromagnets possibly?
[14:34] <Plinky> Slowriot, solar sails combined with that would seem effective.
[14:34] <vurtual> What does that entail besides repelling the antimatter away from the parts?
[14:35] <slowriot> vurtual: keeping it accelerated as you accelerate
[14:35] <slowriot> Plinky: that's a thought... the sail area could double as a scoop...

[14:35] <vurtual> Also get a dilithium crystal.
[14:35] <vurtual> warp coils and boom
[14:36] <Plinky> Solar sails would need to be large though and they would need a clear way of slowing down
[14:36] <slowriot> trouble is, sails tend to be fragile at best
[14:36] <slowriot> and when you're going 1/20th speed of light, hydrogen and oxygen atoms aren't the only things you hit
[14:36] <Plinky> Yep
[14:36] <vurtual> Anyways back on the 1%-more-serious side, let's not forget that by the time we're up in space, our ideas for going faster will be beyond any sane level now.
[14:36] <vurtual> So if an antimatter engine is relatively feasable but
[14:36] <Plinky> Planets are possible targets too.
[14:36] <Plinky> XD
[14:36] <vurtual> "inefficient"
[14:37] <Plinky> Vurtual, how about a whole antimatter ship, with you suspended in the middle?

[14:37] <Plinky> I mean, as long as the air you breath doesn't hit any antioxygen, you are pretty much fine.

[14:39] <slowriot> some of the russian satellites in the 70s came armed with machineguns, with their own oxygen cartridges, you know
[14:39] <Plinky> XD
[14:39] <slowriot> just to defend against any risk of manned assault
[14:39] <Plinky> Slowriot, using mass drivers to propel a spacecraft and to launch it?
[14:39] <slowriot> i never heard it explained whether they had some sort of firing reaction system though, to stop them going off-kilter if they fired
[14:39] <vurtual> I, for one, cannot wait for our impending time very soon where we have gigantic space warships.
[14:40] <Parthon> so .. will there be space travel in minecraft?
[14:40] <slowriot> Plinky: it's a nice idea, like in bubblegum crisis or something :)
[14:40] <vurtual> that we can steer using our mind.
[14:40] <Plinky> You just harvest rocks from an asteroid and use them to propel the ship.
[14:40] <vurtual> and then essentially become a massive spaceship when we fly it
[14:40] <slowriot> in minecraft, i want to go to the square moon!

[14:56] <Shadaez> VHE
[14:56] <vurtual> So there's no middleman.
[14:56] <Shadaez> Plinky try Unity3D
[14:56] <Parthon> I thought hammer was the source engine map edit
[14:56] <Parthon> editor
[14:56] <vurtual> it is
[14:56] <Plinky> Shadaez, don't have enough money
[14:56] <vurtual> what in butts is going on
[14:57] <Plinky> My friend has bought it though. So I'm like :(
[14:57] <Shadaez> you don't have $0? :(
[14:57] <vurtual> why does hammer have a "manifest" and why is it broken
[14:57] <Parthon> aaah
[14:57] <Plinky> Shadaez, I mean the expensive version :P
[14:57] <Shadaez> Unity3D's free now, for the indie version
[14:57] <Shadaez> so?
[14:57] <Parthon> it is?!?
[14:57] <Plinky> ...
[14:57] <Plinky> if it is
[14:57] <Parthon> lol
[14:57] <Plinky> I'll shit my pants.
[14:57] <Shadaez> you can use it commercially and stuff, it just lacks pixelshaders

[14:58] <Snowman> I can change my avatar back
[14:58] <Parthon> and no good version support
[14:58] <Shadaez> who cares, it's not that bad

[14:59] <bildramer> hai
[14:59] <Plinky> ...
[14:59] <Plinky> FSS
[14:59] <Parthon> I'm undecided between using unity, or writing my own engine in c++
[14:59] <Parthon> but only because I'm not totally familiar with how unity works
[14:59] <bildramer> good to take an one-day break from computers every once in a while
[14:59] <bildramer> once or twice in a century
[14:59] <bildramer> so
[14:59] <bildramer> Parthon: own engine

[15:02] <Shadaez> Plinky if you use it, I don't mind helping you out, you can also head over to Unitys IRC channel
[15:02] <bildramer> well
[15:02] <bildramer> customizability etc.
[15:02] <Plinky> Thank you Shadaez
[15:02] <Plinky> I might grab the mac version too
[15:02] <Plinky> And use that for computer graphics
[15:02] <vurtual> all of hammer
[15:02] <vurtual> broken
[15:02] <Shadaez> If you're familiar with Hammer, you could probably import maps from it somehow
[15:03] <Plinky> Are there only two free versions Shadaez?
[15:03] <Shadaez> huh?
[15:03] <Shadaez> there's just Unity
[15:03] <Shadaez> iphone's not free
[15:04] <Plinky> Oh, yeah, I just read that XD
[15:04] <Shadaez> you could easily port a game to it though, if you ever wanted to
[15:04] <vurtual> this is not funny.
[15:05] <vurtual> I need my hammer
[15:05] <Shadaez> what?
[15:05] <Plinky> My friend has Unity Pro, I envy him in someways
[15:06] <vurtual> An update broke the entire source sdk.
[15:06] <Plinky> Shadaez, his hammer editor isn't working. XD
[15:06] <vurtual> hammer is completely broken, for pretty much everyone.
[15:06] <vurtual> welp tf2 works and that's it
[15:08] <Plinky> Downloading unity 2.6.1 for mac and windows. I love the fact they released free versions.
[15:08] <vurtual> no it'd have been better if they hid the free versions
[15:08] <vurtual> secretly
[15:08] <vurtual> and you have to solve an ARG to download it.

[15:10] <vurtual> that's only 91f
[15:10] <vurtual> man up
[15:10] <Plinky> F is fail.
[15:10] <Plinky> K is the best
[15:10] <Iguana> Kelvins are gay
[15:10] <Iguana> Celcius is the way to go.
[15:10] <bildramer> :|
[15:11] <bildramer> Kelvin = C - 273.15
[15:11] <Plinky> Kelvin is the best in terms of how it is measures
[15:11] <bildramer> you can say 2K is 2 times 1K
[15:11] <bildramer> unlike C
[15:11] <bildramer> also, 0K is no energy
[15:11] <bildramer> well,
[15:11] <Plinky> 2 Celsius is not double 1 Celsius, which is funny.

[15:23] <Plinky> Not yet.
[15:24] <Plinky> 45 mins left on the windows version download
[15:24] <vurtual> hammer has taken a turn for the not-useful as now you can't use the numpad to camera around while editing a texturre's properties
[15:25] <vurtual> so applying textures is really, really annoying.
[15:25] <Shadaez> Anyone know anyone who makes chiptunes?
[15:25] <Marach-14> but "retro" translation is epic
[15:25] <vurtual> anyone can

[15:26] <Shadaez> a good soldier or demo probably could
[15:27] <Parthon> soldier can

[15:28] <vurtual> I'm just wondering how to put the intel in this shriney-area
[15:29] <vurtual> on the upper platform overlooking it, or inside it?
[15:29] <Shadaez> an engineer oculd probably too, if it build a dispenser by it and hopped up it, lo
[15:29] <Shadaez> wait
[15:29] <vurtual> Yeah but by then he could walk up the ramp right next to it
[15:29] <vurtual> It's moreso just so I don't have all the "fast" classes outrunning everybody else.

[15:30] <vurtual> Demo and soldier can rocketjump/sticky jump, medic's capible of zipping around the ramp I guess.

[15:36] <Iguana> Lul
[15:36] <Shadaez> don't all classes jump the same height
[15:36] <vurtual> so this isn't a problem at all
[15:37] <vurtual> gonna lower the water level, and snow it over a bit
[15:37] <Plinky> Shadaez, but three have ways to increase their jump height
[15:37] <Shadaez> four
[15:37] <Plinky> Scout with double jump, soldier with rocket jump and demo with sticky jump.
[15:37] <Plinky> Wait, what is the fourth?

[15:38] <Plinky> Unless you mean engies and dispensers

[16:04] <Shadaez> you can't get colder than abs 0
[16:04] <CrazySpai> vurtual, not really.
[16:04] <Shadaez> because no energy is present
[16:04] <vurtual> the atoms move backwards in time, Shadaez.
[16:04] <Snowman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vAfXNzXueE&feature=related
[16:04] <vurtual> the forces are negative
[16:04] <bildramer> fuck yeah bubblegum
[16:05] <KodaichiZero> I think I figured out cannons for minecraft.
[16:05] <bildramer> sadly I can't kick ass
[16:05] <vurtual> and thusly, when you hit anything, multiple instances of it are in that spot at once, and heat cannot transfer.
[16:05] <vurtual> adding heat makes it colder.
[16:05] <KodaichiZero> You build a cannon out ot a sideways U shape of iron
[16:05] <bildramer> wtf
[16:05] <bildramer> -1 is not reachable
[16:05] <bildramer> nor is 0 supposed to be
[16:05] <vurtual> this ice is -12 degrees
[16:05] <vurtual> do you want to lick it, bildramer?
[16:05] <Snowman> -1 Kelvin is impossible
[16:05] <KodaichiZero> It works like a crafting table: open it up, it has 4 things
[16:05] <bildramer> it would need infinite energy and shit
[16:05] <vurtual> your tongue will fly out the back of your head
[16:06] <Snowman> 0 is the the complete lack of energy
[16:06] <bildramer> lol
[16:06] <Wervyn> Triple dog dare.
[16:06] <bildramer> well
[16:06] <bildramer> energy is quantized amirite
[16:06] <KodaichiZero> one slot for a cannon ball, one slot for gunpowder, and two buttons that rotate it left or right
[16:06] <bildramer> so let's say a particle is moving at 1 quant

[16:06] <Wervyn> They'll totally have to call the fire department.
[16:06] <bildramer> it's like 0.0000000000000000..0001483866 Kelvin
[16:06] <KodaichiZero> you put in one cannon ball, and the amount of gunpowder you put in determines the trajectory
[16:07] <vurtual> the fire department will have to be reverse-called Wervyn
[16:07] <KodaichiZero> then, light the back of the cannon to fire it.
[16:07] <bildramer> so you can't stop it without having another 0-energy particle
[16:07] <Shadaez> 0 is possible, and probably has occured in a lab, it's just impossible to observe and prove, because as soon as you do, you add energy and it is ruint
[16:07] <vurtual> what happens if I put 3 cannonball in, and one gunpowder, KodaichiZero?
[16:07] <Wervyn> They'll have been there already.
[16:07] <vurtual> shoootgun?
[16:07] <KodaichiZero> It fires a particle that makes an explosion the size of a creeper blast!
[16:07] <vurtual> determine how much energy you add observing
[16:07] <vurtual> then, observe the energy
[16:07] <bildramer> well, p -> <- p => <- p p ->

[16:09] <bildramer> or 3s etc.
[16:09] <KodaichiZero> 10 gunpowders + 10 cannonballs + 1 cannon = Tactical Nuke
[16:09] <bildramer> then if every ball is moving at s, you can't stop one
[16:09] <vurtual> shotgun nuke
[16:09] <vurtual> 1337 gunpowders + 1 mega cannonball=deagle brand cannondeagle
[16:09] <vurtual> TAKE THE WHEELS OFF AND IT'S A DEAGLE
[16:09] <bildramer> energy conservation etc. means all collisions will have somehow 2s undirectionally
[16:09] <KodaichiZero> lol. anyways I think it would work.

[16:11] <bildramer> so
[16:11] <vurtual> take off the grip and load one round at a time, firing it like a cannon at cans.
[16:11] <vurtual> or some other pistol round
[16:11] <KodaichiZero> seems impractical lol.

[16:11] <KodaichiZero> But then you might be able to survive the recoil
[16:11] <bildramer> more like water
[16:11] <vurtual> You'd have a computer based fuse, so you hit the fire button on top and then run away

[16:18] <vurtual> The DEAGLE brand DEAGLE has been submitted to the tf2 contribution thing

[16:21] <bildramer> ffffffuuuuuuu
[16:21] <vurtual> Could you make it so it ubers into tigerstripes and gold?
[16:21] <vurtual> Because all real DEAGLE brand DEAGLES are tigerstripe and gold
[16:21] <Shadaez> I think it's a shader

[16:23] <LG_Legacy> But it affects down below?
[16:23] <Shadaez> it prevented something or something
[16:23] <vurtual> I can see it now. A 7 round revolver, infinitely accurate, recoil to make you face the other direction, extra damage, and when it crits it becomes flaming, painted gold with tigerstripe. And fires rockets.

[16:25] <vurtual> it's a fire beam
[16:25] <vurtual> like the quake 2 beam but it's fire.
[16:25] <liq3> Neo > fire.
[16:25] <vurtual> Would come with a secondary fire that adds cannon wheels.
[16:26] <vurtual> And when you crouch and look down, they roll with the ground.
[16:26] <Shadaez> why did you post that disturbing image?
[16:26] <vurtual> If you try to do supported fire with the cannon wheels, they just blow off.

[16:28] <KodaichiZero> The cerebral cortex (cerebellum?) I think is the most important part

[17:40] <Snowman> Anyway, Should I give him trollface.jpg?
[17:40] <KodaichiZero> FireRat: one way to fix internet lag is to stop the downloadin man
[17:41] <FireRat> I'm not downloading
[17:41] <KodaichiZero> to fix graphical lag, update your graphics card drivers
[17:41] <bildramer> FireRat: close useless programs, get a better internet connection, get better RAM/CPU/graphics card
[17:41] <bildramer> buy a new computer, delete old files, check for viruses
[17:41] <Jat> what kind of lag?
[17:41] <bildramer> anything can reduce lag
[17:41] <bildramer> lol
[17:41] <Jat> firerat what kind of lag?
[17:41] <FireRat> Lag while playing MineCraft...
[17:41] <Jat> in multiplayer or singleplayer?
[17:41] <FireRat> mostly when I am chasing down a pig or a monster
[17:42] <Jat> oh
[17:42] <FireRat> in Infdev
[17:42] <Jat> yeah

[17:42] <Jat> infdev?
[17:42] <Jat> haha
[17:42] <gear> KodaichiZero: because in spanish the ja is the "ha" sound
[17:42] <Jat> i cant play infdev either because of the lag created by the constant hard drive access
[17:42] <vurtual> how do I fix problem?
[17:42] <KodaichiZero> yeah
[17:42] <vurtual> anyone?
[17:42] <vurtual> What kind of problem!?
[17:42] <vurtual> The problem kind!

[17:42] <KodaichiZero> vurtual: make sure your computer is plugged in
[17:42] <bildramer> lol
[17:42] <FireRat> So while playing infdev there is no fix for lag? besides getting all kinds of expensive thins for my computer
[17:42] <Quatroking> wasn't jajajajaja that thing that muslims yell when they're about to blow up
[17:42] <Jat> hopefully that problem will not be a problem by the time multiplayer is updated or else i am fucked

[17:43] <Quatroking> honestly I'm not having any hdd problems with my two Western Digital drives
[17:44] <gear> is it very choppy or is it slow to move?
[17:44] <Quatroking> sata baby
[17:44] <FireRat> choppy
[17:44] <Quatroking> its a lot faster.
[17:44] <KodaichiZero> I think you can like furry stuff without being a total furfag.
[17:44] <bildramer> FireRat, you can close other programs, lower the resolution, press F until it doesn't lag
[17:44] <gear> what are your computer specs?
[17:44] <Jat> quatro what speed are your hdds?
[17:44] <Quatroking> uh
[17:44] <vurtual> you're setting me up

[19:09] <bildramer> they should erupt
[19:09] <blaster> There is a ore containing gold,silver and sulpher all together
[19:09] <blaster> but if that was added it would be overpowered as hell
[19:10] <blaster> Not to mention we cannot use pyrrhotite, despite containing iron, with the current smelters
[19:10] <bildramer> RL is op
[19:10] <Snowman> http://i44.tinypic.com/141obup.jpg

[19:35] <vurtual> ok guys, we need to build a sustainable structure on our moon, which can be lived in, at least for a time(a week), without any effort on the part of an operator or the person, by an everyday person, and comes with the ability for an everyday person to equip a suit and use an airlock to walk on the moon casually, and can take a fast form of transit for anyone who visits.
[19:36] <vurtual> before 2020
[19:36] <vurtual> BEFOOAAH THIS DECADE IS OUT
[19:36] <Vicrry> gl curt
[19:36] <Vicrry> *vurt
[19:36] <Cial> so we tie rockets to japan and launch it to the moon?
[19:36] <vurtual> Having big curved windows that show the moon are optional, though at least one casual viewing room should be cool.
[19:37] <Quatroking> build a magnet train between earth and the moon
[19:37] * Elsie (Mibbit@c-98-209-8-247.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[19:37] <vurtual> nothing about it actually having a super-super-fast transit. It could support some kind of universal docking clamp, even if we can't use it.
[19:37] <bildramer> cool story bro
[19:37] <bildramer> think of rotation nubz
[19:38] <vurtual> Like, you go up an elevator platform(because on the moon, a simple elevator platform is safe enough), or do a low G climb, and then maybe through an easy safety airlock, and then you're in a big dome that lets you clearly see everything.
[19:38] <Quatroking> bildramer we add gps
[19:38] <bildramer> it should be attached to the moon
[19:38] <Quatroking> done
[19:38] <blaster> Yeh, google moon
[19:38] <sllide> hmm whenever i load indev and generate a new level it generates it and then returns to the main menu? 0.o
[19:38] <bildramer> <Cial> so we tie rockets to japan and launch it to the moon?
[19:38] <bildramer> yeeeeeeeeah
[19:38] <vurtual> Then the next innovation should be retrofitting the moon to support our GPS systems.
[19:38] <vurtual> so we can use any normal GPS on the moon
[19:38] <vurtual> and it has google maps running 24/7
[19:39] <AzureAngelic> i would think the moon lacks landmarks
[19:39] <bildramer> wat
[19:39] <AzureAngelic> "to your right, a crater"
[19:39] <AzureAngelic> "to your left, a bigass crater"
[19:39] <bildramer> "and now...
[19:39] <vurtual> "Now arriving, at: Crater your momma made."
[19:39] <vurtual> "Next right."
[19:39] <bildramer> the moment we've all been waiting for...
[19:39] <blaster> Gone make a minecraft map which looks like this: http://i43.tinypic.com/21vk41.png

[19:40] <AzureAngelic> a lava pit with a support pillar and a floating turd?
[19:40] <vurtual> Did we ramp into space again?
[19:40] <blaster> Yes azure
[19:40] <Cial> sush they dont know that vurt
[19:40] <blaster> The floating turd has trees on
[19:40] <Cial> plus i got a tad mixed up in my numbers
[19:40] <bildramer> D: mental image
[19:40] <blaster> It will take partial map editing
[19:40] <vurtual> ALSO GUYS I JUST
[19:40] <vurtual> GOT THIS REALLY COOL IDEA
[19:40] <bildramer> came
[19:40] <vurtual> Instead of WINDOWS
[19:40] <blaster> partial building in creative
[19:40] <vurtual> We use CAMERAS and SCREENS
[19:40] <vurtual> To LOOK LIKE WINDOWS
[19:41] <blaster> wat
[19:41] <bildramer> ^
[19:41] <bildramer> stupid ide
[19:41] <bildramer> a
[19:41] <vurtual> So there's cameras outfitted on the outside of the moonbase, and they're on
[19:41] <bildramer> glass is cheaper
[19:41] <vurtual> then, on the inside of the base, are curved screens that display what the cameras see
[19:41] <vurtual> but there's thick metal walls and such in between.
[19:41] <vurtual> So you can't accidentally break a hole in it.
[19:42] <bildramer> there's a cheap alternative
[19:42] <bildramer> end of discussion
[19:42] <vurtual> yeah, but do you want to be playing moon-baseball

[19:43] <AzureAngelic> i think we should just forget about the moon and colonize jupiter

[19:43] <vurtual> I want a moonbase mansion ok
[19:43] <blaster> Jupiter = death
[19:43] <blaster> Unless you colonise a moon

[19:44] <blaster> Jupiters moons are a good choise
[19:44] <vurtual> OUR moon is near here
[19:44] <gear> if you like freezing
[19:44] <vurtual> OUR moon can be easily outfitted with stuff
[19:44] <blaster> The moon has shit minerals
[19:44] <AzureAngelic> we should totally launch that icelanding volcano into neptune
[19:44] <vurtual> If we had a temporary base, we could just ship in gigantic modular sections
[19:44] <vurtual> that snap together
[19:44] <AzureAngelic> see if it catches fire
[19:44] <blaster> You dont have all the shit you need to grow food

[19:45] <vurtual> That's not hindering us
[19:45] <blaster> Dont move to the moon, you cant make a profit there
[19:45] <vurtual> We can literally build anywhere we want.
[19:45] <blaster> Mars you can make a big profit
[19:45] <vurtual> It's called "you build a thing to live in"
[19:45] <AzureAngelic> if we can build anywhere
[19:45] <vurtual> duh
[19:45] <AzureAngelic> why not jupiter >:I
[19:45] <vurtual> because it's far away
[19:45] <vurtual> it'd take forever
[19:45] <vurtual> we do jupiter later
[19:45] <bildramer> we use Earth as a cow farm

[19:46] <AzureAngelic> make the spaceship launcher in a volcano
[19:46] <vurtual> What minerals does it have?
[19:46] <bildramer> CO2 and CH4 get siphoned out every month or so
[19:46] <blaster> You can run one on mars being self sufficient
[19:46] <AzureAngelic> so when it erupts it blasts it to jupiter
[19:46] <bildramer> then it's hamburger time
[19:46] <blaster> Vurtual it does not have the minerals required to grow anything

[19:46] <blaster> its a space colony, not designed to be a permanant home
[19:46] <vurtual> and why does the ISS magically get resources?
[19:46] <AzureAngelic> you know, i wonder if the iss has a self-destruct button
[19:46] <vurtual> We can basically do what we did on the ISS
[19:46] <bildramer> lol
[19:47] <vurtual> but more efficiently

[19:47] <vurtual> It's located in a nuclear submarine
[19:47] <blaster> Dont wana hit anyone
[19:47] <Vicrry> No Azure - they'll just let it slip into the atmosphere and burn in atmo
[19:47] <AzureAngelic> they tried that once though
[19:47] <vurtual> The advantages of the moon is that you have SOME gravity(good for health), a sense of down, and a huge amount of area to land.
[19:47] <AzureAngelic> with a meteor
[19:47] <blaster> Vicrry raining molten metal = not good
[19:47] <blaster> The mir was small enough
[19:47] <AzureAngelic> and it ended up killing the dinosaurs
[19:47] <AzureAngelic> you know what
[19:48] <bildramer> earth = farm
[19:48] <vurtual> Also it's on the moon
[19:48] <bildramer> moon = home
[19:48] <AzureAngelic> lets just hollow out the moon and use it as a cross-planetary storage container
[19:48] <bildramer> easy
[19:48] <bildramer> lol
[19:48] <blaster> The advantage of mars is you have unlimited metals, oxygen can be extracted from rocks and it has the same land area as earth
[19:48] <AzureAngelic> attach some bigass rocket thrusters
[19:48] <blaster> along with a varied geography
[19:48] <AzureAngelic> so we can push it into mars' orbit
[19:48] <vurtual> blaster, so?
[19:48] <bildramer> just colonize everything
[19:48] <vurtual> One of the main challenges of the moon
[19:48] <vurtual> is that if we can colonize it
[19:48] <blaster> We can colonise it
[19:48] <vurtual> Then, we can essentially colonize anywhere
[19:48] <bildramer> the moon is near enough
[19:48] <vurtual> the technology will just require placing somewhere else.
[19:48] <blaster> But colonising mars should be our next step after that
[19:48] <vurtual> and boom, a colony there, too.
[19:49] <bildramer> think of travel time etc.
[19:49] <AzureAngelic> if we can colonize anything
[19:49] <blaster> And take down the moon colony because its shit
[19:49] <AzureAngelic> the next space station should be made out of bauxite
[19:49] <vurtual> add a hovering system, you can colonize Jupiter
[19:49] <bildramer> lol
[19:49] <AzureAngelic> and put in orbit around the sun
[19:49] <blaster> Moon colony = starting dwarf fortress in the ocean
[19:49] <bildramer> lol
[19:49] <vurtual> Make it spin, colonize space
[19:49] <bildramer> you can find stone to go through the aquifer though

[19:49] <AzureAngelic> we should build a giant bauxite bubble and put it inside the sun
[19:49] <vurtual> how far down do you have to dig on the moon to reach rock?
[19:49] <AzureAngelic> and use it to harvest solar energy
[19:49] <bildramer> and the waves are nice
[19:50] <vurtual> estimates
[19:50] <bildramer> 6000000m
[19:50] <bildramer> merp
[19:50] <bildramer> 100m
[19:50] <AzureAngelic> i kinda figured rock was everywhere on the moon
[19:50] <AzureAngelic> considering
[19:50] <AzureAngelic> you know
[19:50] <AzureAngelic> its a giant rock
[19:50] <vurtual> yeah, but you have to get to it
[19:50] <Ensirum> anyone i know in here?
[19:50] <AzureAngelic> oh sup
[19:50] <vurtual> Okay, once the little moon base HQ tower is up, and you have a working moonhome.
[19:50] <vurtual> build a moon elevator.
[19:50] <Ensirum> do i know you Azure?
[19:50] <AzureAngelic> i was the guy talking to you on gaia earlier
[19:50] <vurtual> that goes down 100m, into the rock.
[19:51] <bildramer> colonizing anything shouldn't be that hard
[19:51] <bildramer> but it needs money
[19:51] <vurtual> If we have enough air, we can pump it with a little bit of air at a time, so incase of someone's light cave spacesuit malnfuncioning, they don't die very fast.
[19:51] <bildramer> and the military needs money too, you know
[19:51] <vurtual> Then, mine it for rock.
[19:51] <bildramer> priorities
[19:51] <vurtual> We will make things out of moonrock.
[19:51] <vurtual> deep rock
[19:51] <bildramer> killing terrorists and nonterrorists and stuff
[19:51] <bildramer> > moon colony
[19:51] <Ensirum> what are you two talking about?
[19:52] <vurtual> Crafts to sell, things we need made out of stone, and such.
[19:52] <Ensirum> people dying = crafts?!
[19:52] <bildramer> vurtual, there's no atmosphere
[19:52] <vurtual> basically their economy will be based off of random funny stuff.
[19:52] <bildramer> remember
[19:52] <vurtual> Imagine having model moons.
[19:52] <vurtual> made out of the moon
[19:52] <bildramer> we should make just a big hollow hemisphere
[19:52] <Ensirum> am i allowed to post a link to tinypic? or one of my crafts?
[19:52] <bildramer> yeahc

[19:54] <vurtual> and a moon observatory
[19:54] <vurtual> for observing things
[19:54] <blaster> Vurtual once your on mars you dont need to send more stuff over
[19:54] <vurtual> so?
[19:54] <vurtual> the moon is close enough
[19:54] <Jake> so last night I dreampt I was in Multiplayer Survival
[19:54] <bildramer> wat
[19:54] <blaster> you can smelt iron, create oxygen from the rocks, get water from the rocks....
[19:54] <bildramer> blaster: water?
[19:54] <blaster> You can even grow stuff from the rocks
[19:54] <vurtual> rent out things like moon summerhomes, moon hotels, moon spacesuits for moonroaming
[19:54] <blaster> Yes bildramer, water
[19:54] <bildramer> the rocks have hydrogen?
[19:54] <Jake> slugging it out in a flooded mine with a few other players
[19:54] <bildramer> :o
[19:54] <blaster> Yes, they have enough
[19:55] <bildramer> well
[19:55] <blaster> a 1x1 meter cube will provide 6 gallons
[19:55] <bildramer> I don't think it's enough
[19:55] <bildramer> why the hell do you research
[19:55] <bildramer> ok, it's enough
[19:55] <blaster> Because I do
[19:55] <bildramer> so
[19:55] <bildramer> mars
[19:55] <vurtual> also, another advantage of the moon base
[19:55] <vurtual> internet
[19:55] <AzureAngelic> last night i dreamt i was on a patio overlooking a huge sunset area with a bunch of other people discussing the deleted dance sequence in the third digimon movie which didn't exist
[19:55] <blaster> If you increased the martaian tempreture you could terraform the planet in just 200 years using FC's
[19:55] <bildramer> bonus points for colonizing Mars on April 1st
[19:56] <vurtual> guys there's spiders in my room I'm outta here
[19:56] <bildramer> in just 200 years

[19:56] <blaster> Thats fast

[19:56] <AzureAngelic> if batman helped us
[19:56] <bildramer> nueks
[19:56] <Quatroking> hmm
[19:56] <blaster> with a population of about 10,000 it would take 200 years
[19:56] <AzureAngelic> he can breath and fly in space
[19:56] <bildramer> nuke the shit out of rock
[19:56] <Quatroking> maybe I should make a movie with muhammad
[19:56] <blaster> With a population of 100,000 it would take 20 years
[19:56] <AzureAngelic> so he could colonize everything
[19:56] <bildramer> can rock absorb radiation or something?

[19:56] <blaster> Yes
[19:56] <blaster> DUH
[19:57] <Vicrry> last night I hads a dream: I was dreaming that I was asleep and dreaming about being asleep and dreaming about being asleep and dreami.. then I got up and turned off the Pink Floyd that was screwing with my head :P
[19:57] <bildramer> and send it back slowly over time?
[19:57] <bildramer> :|
[19:57] <blaster> But that makes rock radioactive
[19:57] <blaster> Luckily it leaves mars easier due to no atmosphere
[19:57] <descention> I don't understand why we don't just spit some cactii at mars...
[19:57] <bildramer> exattly
[19:57] <bildramer> c
[19:57] <blaster> But nuking mars is stil;l bad
[19:57] <vurtual> Also also also also another reason to colonize the moon
[19:57] <blaster> Descention its because they would explode

[19:58] <vurtual> and then an extra little thing
[19:58] <vurtual> nerf guns, in spaaace.
[19:58] <bildramer> :|
[19:58] <descention> blaster: how about space cacti?
[19:58] <bildramer> bazookas
[19:58] <bildramer> in spaaace
[19:58] <blaster> Guys, the only shit worth colonising in this solar system is Mars, ganymede, and io (Although Io is extremely dangerous)
[19:59] <blaster> Unless you thing setting up a space station in saturns atmosphere is a good idea
[19:59] <bildramer> IO
[19:59] <bildramer> cue the jokes
[19:59] <blaster> Io has good selection of minerals
[19:59] <blaster> Very good
[19:59] <blaster> Extremely rich
[19:59] <blaster> but dangerous
[19:59] <descention> so it would be good for a mining colony?
[19:59] <blaster> Yes, a profitable colony
[19:59] <descention> like in those sci-fi shows
[19:59] <bildramer> why not look in other solar systems
[19:59] <Wervyn> Or Europa. Except not, attempt no landings there.
[19:59] <descention> blaster: they're kinda far away
[20:00] <blaster> Bildramer we should take over the solar system before that
[20:00] <bildramer> orly
[20:00] <bildramer> why not miss a step
[20:00] <bildramer> :P
[20:00] <bildramer> HEY I KNOW LET'S COLONIZE THE SUN
[20:00] <vurtual> I want to use a nerf gun in space
[20:00] <vurtual> that's our priority
[20:00] <bildramer> that's one big power source
[20:00] <blaster> Moon = sending a supply ship every month Mars = only need 1 supply ship a year
[20:00] <blaster> Bildramer mercury might be a possibility
[20:01] <bildramer> or a big supply ship at the start
[20:01] <descention> solar panels ftw
[20:01] <blaster> Unless solar flare shit happens, then your fucked
[20:01] <bildramer> with lots of honey
[20:01] <Wervyn> We should totally ignite Jupiter into a star.
[20:01] <vurtual> A sun colony would be cool too
[20:01] <bildramer> or some other food that won't rot easily
[20:01] <bildramer> lol
[20:01] <vurtual> imagine landing a ship on a pad
[20:01] <blaster> bildramer you can only take about 20T worth of shit NO MATTER HOW BIG IT IS
[20:01] <bildramer> :O
[20:01] <bildramer> why?
[20:01] <vurtual> and then yo usee a flare, and the entire pad submerges
[20:01] <blaster> Because hevier = more fuel = hevier
[20:01] <bildramer> yeah
[20:01] <vurtual> then you get out of the shuttle in soem fancy suit, and there's laser grids that stop you from falling off, even while you're half-inside sun stuff
[20:01] <bildramer> research better fuel
[20:01] <bildramer> use nukes to launch
[20:02] <descention> ...
[20:02] <bildramer> antimatter maybe
[20:02] <blaster> bildramer we are trying ion drives
[20:02] <bildramer> lol
[20:02] <vurtual> then you walk inside, and you can go down to glass which lets you see inside the sun
[20:02] <blaster> but they are only useful once your out of earths orbit
[20:02] <descention> yeah... make a single use explosion as your propulsion

[20:02] <vurtual> and there's ships and people working down there
[20:02] <blaster> Ion drives cannot be used to take off, so they still give the limit of 20t
[20:02] <bildramer> :l
[20:02] <blaster> They can only be used once your in space
[20:02] <whatdoesth> you're*
[20:02] <bildramer> you're**
[20:03] <bildramer> <blaster> but they are only useful once your out of earths orbit
[20:03] <bildramer> here too
[20:03] <blaster> Yes...
[20:03] <bildramer> grammar Jews
[20:03] <bildramer> :|
[20:03] <descention> blaster: so we send several ships of 20t each up to space then use the ion drive?
[20:03] <bildramer> so

[20:03] <blaster> Yes, but that is still expecive as fuck
[20:04] <descention> but it would be cheaper than sending several 20t ships the entire distance
[20:04] <bildramer> 1 unit of weight -> X percent is fuel
[20:04] <bildramer> 2 units of weight -> 2X percent of 1 unit is fuel
[20:04] <bildramer> right?
[20:04] <bildramer> actually, that's not right, but why?
[20:04] * DarkCybrid (Mibbit@207.191.155.222) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[20:04] <blaster> Descention once you have a velocity you wait
[20:04] <blaster> You can go as fast or slow as you like
[20:05] <blaster> but faster increces the price, and requires either less cargo or ion drive

[22:10] <AzureAngelic> they can do that?

[22:10] <vurtual> is it the dark green tile covering it?

[22:12] <vurtual> smelters only have the top tile I think
[22:12] <vurtual> while metalsmith forges have the left and right
[22:12] <vurtual> try building one, and check which tiles are light/dark, then hover exactly over the spot of the already-placed one and see if the magma is in the light or dark
