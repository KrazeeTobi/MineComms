[0:03] <Visiiri> omg
[0:03] <Visiiri> the topic says "Don't read topic"

[0:03] <DatOneGuy> Once SMP rolls around, I'm making a huge town
[0:03] <Visiiri> i read it
[0:03] <Zivhayr> I'm quite content with my small hut with pig farm
[0:03] <Visiiri> what do I does
[0:03] <Manomow> yes?
[0:03] <DatOneGuy> With fucking EPIC huge walls
[0:03] <Zivhayr> It said, don't read it at your own risk
[0:03] <DatOneGuy> and we'll fight the other guys >:)

[0:04] <Visiiri> I stopped reading there to prevent trouble.
[0:04] <Zivhayr> "Don't read the topic at your own risk"
[0:04] <LordAidan> *reads*
[0:04] <Visiiri> I can't read it to prove you wrong
[0:04] <Visiiri> x.x
[0:04] <csc> and the precise reason i hate windows, because it loves to crash and freeze for no obvious reason at all :)
[0:04] <DatOneGuy> YAY i found slimes :D
[0:04] <asiekierka> i didn't read it
[0:04] <asiekierka> :D
[0:04] <DatOneGuy> but I don't have an arrow, what do? >.>
[0:05] <DatOneGuy> bow/arrow*
[0:05] <csc> thus breaking one of my sd cards in the process o/
[0:05] <Zivhayr> What do slime balls craft?
[0:05] <Manomow> Im also going to add the "black market"
[0:05] <asiekierka> ALSO the village will probably have a free tram road to the spawnpoint
[0:05] <asiekierka> yes, free
[0:05] <Visiiri> guys, today
[0:05] <Visiiri> I found a bite array in Minecraft
[0:05] <Visiiri> that can stop the delay if you miss hitting something
[0:05] <Zivhayr> Black Market in SMP. Every time a member of the group dies, 3 pieces of meat mysteriously appear for sale.
[0:05] <Visiiri> so you can just swing constantly
[0:05] <Manomow> lol
[0:05] <DatOneGuy> 1 cloth can be turned into 9 string right? My only problem seems to be the bow...
[0:05] <DatOneGuy> the arrows*
[0:06] <DatOneGuy> I don't have a lot if iron :|
[0:06] <Zivhayr> Cloth can be turned into string? :S
[0:06] <DatOneGuy> Not sure, read it on echidna tribe
[0:06] <Zivhayr> My long spider hunts were all a waste!
[0:06] <Manomow> anymore town ideas?
[0:06] <DatOneGuy> Oh god... I found water, in my cavern! D:
[0:07] <Zivhayr> Oh dear.
[0:07] <DatOneGuy> It's at the top, but not flowing down
[0:07] <DatOneGuy> Will it eventually flow? O.o
[0:07] <Zivhayr> What do you mean?
[0:07] <Inside> I don't get MC water
[0:07] <Inside> it makes even less sense than infinite water in creative
[0:07] <DatOneGuy> I mean I actually have a waterfall in here, and the water flows, then just 'stops'
[0:07] * Azure (Azure@pool-74-96-16-239.washdc.east.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)
[0:07] <DatOneGuy> It 'should' keep going and fill this entire cavern
[0:07] <DatOneGuy> but it seems to just stop
[0:07] <Inside> if it's not actively expanding, it's not expanding.
[0:07] <Zivhayr> It won't go any furthur than where it stopped
[0:08] <Zivhayr> unless you break the things below it
[0:08] <Inside> the rest evaporates or something.
[0:08] <DatOneGuy> Found more water down or some deal
[0:08] <LordAidan> You know what would be stupid?
[0:08] <Zivhayr> Minecraft?
[0:08] <LordAidan> If Notch made it so you found lava outside
[0:08] <Zivhayr> I found lava outside
[0:08] <LordAidan> ...
[0:08] <LordAidan> Notch, you fail.
[0:08] <Zivhayr> A waterfall, in front of my house.
[0:08] <Zivhayr> It's this really wierd map, caverns, caves, spires, everywhere
[0:09] <Zivhayr> There was one hollow bit in a cliff where I made my house
[0:09] <Zivhayr> And I snipe creepers
[0:09] <Inside> LordAidan: volcanic activity lol
[0:09] <Zivhayr> Volcanos. Would ruin so much, yet be so awesome.
[0:09] <Rooster> LordAidan: He did on purpose
[0:09] <DatOneGuy> 1 iron block = 1 iron bar?
[0:09] <Rooster> Because he can.
[0:09] <Inside> DatOneGuy: yes
[0:10] <DatOneGuy> I'm gonna need a looot more iron then :(
[0:10] <Zivhayr> And it's free
[0:10] <Inside> it looks fucking awesome, until you wrap your head around it and go "whaa?"
[0:10] * chariot (charitoPL@cpe-065-188-062-039.sc.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: : -)

[0:12] <Shrub> I just found one the most beautiful harbours
[0:12] <DatOneGuy> It also... has a waterfall...
[0:12] <DatOneGuy> and randomly stops :|
[0:13] <Zivhayr> It thins out.
[0:13] <Willox> I found an awesome environment made cave yesterday, sadly that was whilst i had unlimited tnt :c
[0:13] <Willox> Cave = Dead
[0:13] <DatOneGuy> omg I killed a slime :D
[0:13] <DatOneGuy> and it was big
[0:13] <Willox> I loaded my save during the slime bug, :| they were literally everywhere
[0:14] <Dormarth> I have a question, actually. Anyone know if there's a way to have a mouseover label display for the inventory? A mod maybe?
[0:14] <Willox> If you dont kill it with a sword it turns into smaller slime
[0:14] <DatOneGuy> Can stone mine gold, or do I need iron?
[0:14] * ZirumsHero_ (IceChat7@68-190-251-164.dhcp.ccmn.ca.charter.com) has left #minecraft

[0:15] <Soviet_1> willox, your 'everywhere' is not everywhere enough
[0:15] <Soviet_1> every part of my base spawns slimes
[0:15] <Soviet_1> EVERY part
[0:15] <Soviet_1> except the doors
[0:15] <mnjiman> and you need diamond for obsidian
[0:15] <DatOneGuy> Thanks
[0:15] <Shrub> this harbour is so gorgeous
[0:15] <Willox> Thats what i mean, i saved in a little room with no slimes and 2 doors, both doors had slimes staring it at me, i didnt know what a slime was i was like wtf
[0:15] * ZirumsHero_ (IceChat7@68-190-251-164.dhcp.ccmn.ca.charter.com) has left #minecraft
[0:15] <Rooster> Slimes need to stop spawning so much.
[0:15] <Rooster> Or I
[0:16] <Willox> I think they will
[0:16] <Rooster> m gonna stab someone
[0:16] * Twdtwd (Twdtwd@c-76-97-42-209.hsd1.ga.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:16] <Soviet_1> something is wrong with the game, when 80% of my base has slimes
[0:16] <Dormarth> Yeah, I've started farming obsidian. I have something like 400 blocks saved up for a vault in the skyscraper I'm building =D
[0:16] <Willox> After i killed them all i havn't seen a single slime since, i made then extinct
[0:16] <Shrub> OH FFS
[0:16] <csc> one thing that bugged me about alpha is the fact that i kept getting my house blown to pieces after daybreak
[0:17] <Shrub> DON'T FUCKING CRASH JAVA
[0:17] * Xybjj (orangeband@bb219-74-248-249.singnet.com.sg) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:17] * Shrub rages so hard
[0:17] <csc> its like *ding dong* *poof*
[0:17] <ZirumsHero> Weren't the slimes supposed to be able to climb walls or something?
[0:17] <csc> D:
[0:17] <DatOneGuy> Heh charcoal is so good for burning once I found quite a bit of it o_o
[0:17] <Zivhayr> I remember when ladders came out
[0:17] <Shrub> charcoal?
[0:17] <Zivhayr> I had a huge ladder up to my tower thingy
[0:17] <DatOneGuy> Also found me some of that bamboo shit
[0:17] <DatOneGuy> coal, my bad :\/
[0:17] <Zivhayr> "Hurr I'm safe up here"
[0:17] <Zivhayr> Then a zombie climbed up
[0:17] <Zivhayr> And pushed me off
[0:17] <Willox> If they learn to climb, my lava moat may become useless
[0:18] <pocketprobe> I'm goin to bed, its 3:20 here. NIght all
[0:18] <DatOneGuy> Lol climbing zombies
[0:18] <DatOneGuy> Nigjht

[0:18] <slowriot> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=20091
[0:18] <slowriot> happy days
[0:18] <slowriot> etc
[0:18] <Dormarth> So, anyone have an idea for how to get labels on the inventory? Hard to tell some blocks apart from eachother on a netbook =/
[0:18] <ZirumsHero> Labels?
[0:18] <DatOneGuy> It'd be very nice if there were popups to tell me what was what, eah
[0:18] * Buffalo (Buffalo@110-174-33-89.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[0:18] <Soviet_1> i can'y play MC on netbook
[0:19] <Soviet_1> the frame rate of 2-3 fps can't do for me
[0:19] <Soviet_1> especially with slimes everywhere
[0:19] <Pelum> 5 levels got the speed run
[0:19] <Pelum> woo woo
[0:19] <Pelum> :D
[0:19] <ZirumsHero> On my netbook, I get 23 - 25 fps if I were by the ocean, above ground, doing nothing, staring at a tree.
[0:19] <Dormarth> Zirums - Yeah, like a little box with an items name that pops up when you mouse over it.
[0:19] <Soviet_1> that is weird...
[0:19] <Soviet_1> i got asus eeepc 1000 he, and it lags like mad
[0:20] <Rooster> So my saves exploded
[0:20] <ZirumsHero> Ah.. didn't Notch say he didn't want to name blocks "officially" anymore?
[0:20] <ZirumsHero> (disregarding Redstone)
[0:20] <Willox> I broke perl on my netbook and cant be bothered to fix it so i cant download anything except binaries... from firefox on wine because firefox without wine needs perl
[0:20] <Willox> grrr
[0:20] <Zivhayr> Yes, he did.
[0:20] <Rooster> ZirumsHero: I think he broke that rule when everyone started bitching over names
[0:21] * Buffalo slaps Zerim around a bit with a large ceylon gooseberry
[0:21] <ZirumsHero> O: Poor Zerim
[0:21] <Zerim> wat
[0:21] <Buffalo> No clue.
[0:21] <Zerim> :<
[0:21] <Buffalo> Hey Zerim.
[0:21] <Zerim> what did I do D:
[0:21] <Zerim> Who are you? >:O
[0:21] <Buffalo> /nick iamthehero
[0:21] <Dormarth> Well, then a mod? I don't care if it labels gold as shiny pebbles and iron as sharp 'n pointies, I just want to have an easier time telling them apart
[0:21] <Buffalo> I feel like following people around, today.
[0:21] <Zerim> oh hai
[0:22] <ZirumsHero> Rooster: Yeah... Redstone was a mess pre-named hahahaha
[0:22] <DatOneGuy> Is iron armor better or an iron sword?
[0:22] <DatOneGuy> To get first that is
[0:22] <Grizzlechips> I still have no idea how to use redstone
[0:22] <Willox> I didnt even try to fight till i had my diamond stuff, so i never had an iron sword
[0:22] <Grizzlechips> other than to make an auto-opening door
[0:22] <Dormarth> Iron sword. The armor only helps maginally.
[0:22] <DatOneGuy> Thanks
[0:22] <csc> DatOneGuy, would you rather procrastinate or be proactive :P
[0:22] <DatOneGuy> I have 20 steel leftover, and no string :|
[0:22] <Dormarth> Grizzle - You can also set up lighting systems and explosives =D
[0:22] * Twdtwd (Twdtwd@c-76-97-42-209.hsd1.ga.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[0:22] <ZirumsHero> to me, redstone is only useful for making XOR gates and a lock switch.
[0:23] <Willox> I bet theres a counter with how many times people try to guess the invite code
[0:23] <Manomow> any town ideas!?!?!?!?
[0:23] <Zivhayr> I guessed "NotchisGod"
[0:23] <Willox> Damnit i bugged
[0:23] <Zivhayr> It didnt work
[0:23] <DatOneGuy> I only have one arrow that I got from a skeleton :|
[0:23] * Tukiko (Tukiko@c-98-225-141-35.hsd1.pa.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[0:23] <Dormarth> I'm thinking a town that leaves no surface trace of its existance.
[0:24] <Willox> Underground, water entrance? :D
[0:24] <DatOneGuy> I guess I'll finish my house and have a try at killing those zombehs
[0:24] <ZirumsHero> Zombies are strong! U:
[0:24] <DatOneGuy> D:
[0:24] <Zivhayr> zthey are!
[0:24] <Dormarth> Yeah, and replace a dirt block on top of the ladder down so someone could be swimming right over it and not know
[0:24] <Zivhayr> I once saw a Zombie solo a skeleton
[0:24] <DatOneGuy> So what should I get before I kill those? :<
[0:24] <Dormarth> Er, standing on it
[0:24] <Zivhayr> Swords!
[0:24] <DatOneGuy> I need arrows!
[0:24] <DatOneGuy> I have an iron sword , is that enough?
[0:24] <Zivhayr> Yes
[0:24] <Willox> When multiplayer is done im gonna have a 2 man coop server :3
[0:24] <ZirumsHero> Zivhayr: hehe I did, too. But that's only if the skele is fighting on a hill.
[0:25] <DatOneGuy> Hmm, and for the spiders?
[0:25] <DatOneGuy> I want anarrow :|
[0:25] <DatOneGuy> bow/arrow*
[0:25] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@180.181.107.135) Quit (Quit: bye peoples.)
[0:25] <Zivhayr> It was strange, I got a skeleton to fight a zombie, the zombie just kept walking after it. I was thinking, "Heh, skeleton will win hands down" and they went around a corner. I waited a bit then I saw a single arrow on the ground and a zombie walking off
[0:25] <Manomow> I!
[0:25] <Manomow> NEED!
[0:25] <Manomow> TOWN!
[0:25] <Manomow> IDEAS!
[0:26] <ZirumsHero> HAH! Nice.
[0:26] <Manomow> PLEASE!
[0:26] <Dormarth> Mano, what are you looking for?
[0:26] <DatOneGuy> I need 4 slime bubbles for a pet?
[0:26] <Dormarth> What kind of town idea? Secure? Flashy? Traditional? Hidden?
[0:26] <Rooster> Manomow, theres a thread somewhere on the forums
[0:27] <Zivhayr> Is it possible to actually keep a pet? i.e One pig in a certain area that won't despawn
[0:27] <Rooster> Manomow: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=14998

[0:31] * Ko (chatzilla@66.183.161.129) has joined #minecraft
[0:32] <Willox> I now have lava lighting
[0:32] <ZirumsHero> SMP is going to rock.
[0:32] <Willox> I think coop servers will be better than public
[0:32] <ZirumsHero> I do not see how bad a public server can get, really. :)
[0:33] <DatOneGuy> If I get a bucket I can make a lava tower right?
[0:33] <DatOneGuy> Like will that one bucket continuously flow and be stopped by the glass?
[0:33] * Echidna-chan is now known as JTE
[0:33] <ZirumsHero> The worst, that I think, is a player gets a stone pickaxe.. mines stone like hell and seals up someones house.
[0:33] <ZirumsHero> but a bucket requires.. 3 bars of steel.. a ton o' effert, no?
[0:33] * Fagbeard (mcflighii@CPE-121-222-189-14.lnse1.woo.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[0:33] <Willox> Well some will be fun, but theres so many overpowered ways to break into someones house
[0:33] <DatOneGuy> I have extra steel so it doesn't seem like a problem I guess..
[0:33] <Willox> Traps wont help, they can just build through your house, not the door
[0:34] <Fagbeard> Lava walls.
[0:34] <Willox> Water buckets

[0:34] <Willox> why sand?
[0:34] <Fagbeard> because
[0:34] <Fagbeard> if they dig it
[0:35] <Fagbeard> lava spill over the top
[0:35] <Fagbeard> on top of them
[0:35] <Willox> hm
[0:35] <Manomow> That link was about bases, im talkin about towns!
[0:35] <Willox> What about

[0:41] <ZirumsHero> O_o
[0:42] <quaxar> Sea otters should be in minecraft as enemies
[0:42] <quaxar> they hold hands
[0:42] <quaxar> and kill you
[0:42] <quaxar> and they wait for you in the kelp
[0:42] <ZirumsHero> lol. . . <_<

[0:43] <Willox> Blue Whales
[0:43] <Willox> Pokemawn!
[0:43] <quaxar> right wales
[0:43] <quaxar> so you can farm spermaceti
[0:43] <quaxar> to make actual eternal torches
[0:43] <quaxar> oh yeah notch isnt from norway damn it
[0:43] <Willox> So no pokemawn? :<
[0:43] <TrueWolves> And hunt the white whale?
[0:44] <quaxar> the joke dosnt work unless he is from norway or greenland
[0:44] <quaxar> ;_;
[0:44] <ZirumsHero> White Whales would be epic. Like a rare find.
[0:44] <DatOneGuy> One question though, why the hell don't they learn how to use offsets on the microwave?
[0:44] <quaxar> how many meters tall are the large enemies?
[0:44] <quaxar> blocks
[0:45] <quaxar> Do they jump in perportion to their height
[0:45] <quaxar> so giant spiders can jump ontop of trees :D

[0:45] <Fagbeard> so the blocks are like 80cmx80cmx80cm?
[0:45] <quaxar> no 1m
[0:46] <Fagbeard> because the player is 2 and a bit blocks tall
[0:46] <TrueWolves> 1 block = 1 meter
[0:46] <Fagbeard> so the player is like
[0:46] <TrueWolves> the minecrafter is 2 meters tall.

[0:46] <ZirumsHero> a player is 1.7 (since you can jump)
[0:46] <Fagbeard> f5
[0:46] <TrueWolves> 1.7? where did this 1.7 come from?
[0:46] <Fagbeard> go third person
[0:46] <quaxar> Notch said it
[0:46] <Fagbeard> he is not 1.7 blocks tall
[0:46] <DatOneGuy> 1.7 came from stfu
[0:46] <ZirumsHero> I recall Notch saying it. . .
[0:46] <TrueWolves> He's 2 meters tall O.o
[0:47] <quaxar> nope
[0:47] <TrueWolves> press f5 and see for your self.

[0:50] <ZirumsHero> blocks, as defined by Notch, are 1mx1m.
[0:51] <Soviet_1> if i want to take human sizes as 1.5 -2 m, then the block size can go for 75cm to 100cm

[0:51] <Fagbeard> as a given, 1 block=1meter

[0:55] <TrueWolves> It's donut shaped.
[0:55] <quaxar> the metric donut
[0:55] <Pelum> DONUT!
[0:55] <Rooster> Like a banana?
[0:55] <TrueWolves> take a very flexable peice of paper, connect 2 sides and you get a tube, right?
[0:55] <quaxar> Time works the same way?

[2:04] <Visiiri> fucking
[2:04] <Visiiri> almost
[2:04] <Visiiri> there
[2:04] <Visiiri> 3 am
[2:04] <Visiiri> ugh
[2:04] <liq3> i
[2:04] <liq3> like
[2:04] <liq3> to
[2:04] <liq3> speak
[2:04] <liq3> in
[2:05] <liq3> one line sentences too.
[2:05] <redRum2k10> shut up
[2:05] <Dormarth> Yeah. I'm hoping to keep all the combat I see to traps. I know it's a pipe dream, but I love engineering!
[2:05] <sorre> there are several forms of trap that are simple, easily concealed, and deadly
[2:05] <liq3> what's gonna be fun is the "obviously trapped hallyway"
[2:05] <liq3> :D
[2:05] <liq3> and how many kills it scores.
[2:05] <Dormarth> Pressure plates EVERYWHERE
[2:06] <Visiiri> Spy sappin my furnace!
[2:06] <Dormarth> None do anything
[2:06] <liq3> "That's no pig, THAT'S A SPY"
[2:06] <Visiiri> That sheep's not one of us!
[2:06] <MikkoK> shit cave sound
[2:07] <Dormarth> So... I'm forseeing a lot of structures built out of furnaces, too. Apparently the 2nd most durable block out there.
[2:07] <Soviet_1> i am still waiting for the conductive block to make my system easier to make
[2:07] <Soviet_1> why furnace again?
[2:07] <Soviet_1> anti TNT?
[2:07] <Dormarth> Takes more time to break

[2:14] <Manomow> I opened a hole in it and looked in and left with remembering to close the hole
[2:14] <TrueWolves> let me know if you disprove the whole mossy stone being immune to TNT thing.
[2:14] <Soviet_1> k
[2:14] <Soviet_1> i will do it tomorrow
[2:14] <Plinky> Well, I doubt anything is immune to tnt
[2:14] <Plinky> Besides bedrock
[2:14] <Dormarth> Mano - So someone screamed griefer? Lame. One hole does not a griefer make.
[2:15] <Dormarth> w
[2:15] <Plinky> Even obby breaks when tnt
[2:15] <Manomow> It was only 9 blocks
[2:15] <Dormarth> That is unless it's under a lava pool <.<
[2:15] <Manomow> i left and came back with a creeper rank
[2:15] <Soviet_1> i just make a simple 3x3x3 test environment with another layer of dirt, drop the TNT right to the middle from the top and see the damage done
[2:15] <Manomow> i mean greifer not creeper
[2:15] <Manomow> lol
[2:15] <Dormarth> Same dif.
[2:16] <Dormarth> Creepers = npc griefers
[2:16] <Manomow> I started a thread for my map: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=20133
[2:16] <Roadcrosser> TW I do
[2:16] <Soviet_1> it is not griefer in natural sense, because griefers do it for lolz
[2:16] <Soviet_1> and they will not do it in your face

[2:20] <Manomow> IM SO STUPID!!!!!!!
[2:20] <epaGamer> lol
[2:21] <Manomow> I SHOULD ADD A GOLDEN ZOMBIE INN TO MY INFDEV TOWN!!!!!
[2:21] <TrueWolves> You know...
[2:21] <TrueWolves> I would trade 6400 dirt for a diamond pickaxe.
[2:21] <bearz> caeks
[2:21] <bearz> :3
[2:21] <TrueWolves> Just becuase 6400 dirt would make me lol.
[2:21] <Plinky> So would I. That would be great for building shit.
[2:21] <Plinky> Or dropping all at once.
[2:21] <bearz> i hope that notch makes that clan flags system
[2:21] <bearz> or something like that
[2:21] <Plinky> The dropping all at once would be lolworthy.
[2:21] <TrueWolves> I sure hope he doesn't, unless it's fair for people who are clanless.
[2:21] <Darksonn> I can take 6400 diamonds for a diamond pix
[2:22] * TrueWolves will NOT be joining a clan.
[2:22] <Plinky> I don't think I will anyway
[2:22] <bearz> TrueWolves: i mean that they can make their own skinnable flag
[2:22] <bearz> that i mean
[2:22] <Plinky> I'll just join servers and make abandon ruins
[2:22] <Plinky> Then leave.
[2:22] <TrueWolves> XD
[2:22] <bearz> they can skin it like you can skin your character
[2:22] * Dormarth will likely join one for the sake of being able to help in large projects.
[2:22] <Darksonn> Will /me work here?
[2:22] <Dormarth> Yes
[2:23] <MikkoK> omg
[2:23] <Darksonn> :)
[2:23] <MikkoK> that baby had poop in her diaper
[2:23] <Plinky> TrueWolves: "These ancient ruins weren't here yesterday,,,"
[2:23] <sorre> would be kind of interesting if minecraft servers could achieve higher numbers of users by having multiple servers work together as a network
[2:23] <MikkoK> smelled very bad
[2:23] <TrueWolves> I'll hunt down oppresive people, assassin for the hire. (though I'll have more fun once Lua scripting is in, Oregon Trail server anyone? or perhaps Sealab survival infmap style?)

[3:34] <Shrub> Build a multi-level tower
[3:34] <Shrub> chinese architecture
[3:34] <RenoFox> i should copy one of the layouts of the old final fantasy castles =D

[3:34] <Shrub> Make the Final Chaos' temple
[3:35] <RenoFox> i mean i have over 3 large chests full of stone and processed stones xD
[3:35] <sorre> only 3?
[3:35] <sorre> it doesn't go as far as you'd think
[3:35] <RenoFox> i started playing last night lol
[3:35] <Plinky> Sorre, I'm happy as long as you don't kill the slimes.
[3:35] <sorre> well, i guess that makes sense
[3:35] <RenoFox> so yea all i've done is mine and mine... and mine, so at least I can start
[3:36] <sorre> it might help to do a bit of casual reading on actual castle architecture
[3:36] <sorre> you may end up with something that's actually a good defense
[3:36] <sorre> in addition to looking totally badass
[3:36] <RenoFox> so many large chests of stone will I need for something inspireing?
[3:36] <sorre> well, what i like to do
[3:36] <sorre> is build above-ground and below-ground at the same time
[3:36] <sorre> like, make a basement
[3:36] <sorre> that way, you can work on the basement when you need stone
[3:36] <sorre> and work on the above-ground half when you have stone
[3:37] <sorre> a self-sustaining project
[3:37] <RenoFox> yea my main establishment is just above my strip mine which i'll make into a basement

[3:39] <sorre> well, 3 is the absolute minimum
[3:39] <sorre> but i like to reserve that for smaller buildings
[3:39] <sorre> 4 is a good base height
[3:39] <RenoFox> okay
[3:39] <sorre> if you don't think it looks high enough, make it higher

[3:41] <RenoFox> ah cool
[3:41] <Cyanicman> non

[3:55] <sorre> here's the same castle, a few days later http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v666/sorretil/Minecraft/castle-front-new.png
[3:55] <Plinky> You know, inside is pretty large compared to the outside really.
[3:55] <RenoFox> yea i'll have to change the dimentions to fit the biggest things then fit the looks to it xD
[3:56] <RenoFox> that' looks cool sorre
[3:56] <sorre> i even had an apartment building behind the castle
[3:56] <Shrub> I can't understand RPG castles ;-;

[3:57] <Shrub> I wonder if there'll be like RP servers, where only people with certain jobs can affect certain blocks, and there'll be currency, and stuff.
[3:57] <Shrub> That'd be fun.
[3:57] <bearz> that guy must have been really drunk
[3:57] <RenoFox> that's a great idea!

[4:35] <Demki> they don't
[4:35] <MikkoK> yeah
[4:35] <DatOneGuy> Do the spawns spawn when there's water/darkness nearby?
[4:35] <Demki> they can respawn
[4:35] <DatOneGuy> I see water and I see a TONNNN of them
[4:35] <Demki> what do you mean spawns spawn?
[4:36] <MikkoK> slimes are like humans!
[4:36] <Plinky> They just keep on reproducing!
[4:36] <Demki> slimes are like cockroaches, you kill 1, 4 more come at you
[4:36] <DatOneGuy> xD
[4:36] <DatOneGuy> I found some static lava
[4:36] <T4r4ntul4> slimes are not above ground luckily
[4:36] <DatOneGuy> but water and slimes everywhere, looks risky

[4:38] <Nahob> cacti are the worst enemy
[4:38] <DatOneGuy> I jumped in, and lost all my armor, but made it out alive :0
[4:38] <DatOneGuy> Those slimes sure know how to gang on a fella
[4:38] <MikkoK> believe us slimes are friends
[4:39] <T4r4ntul4> the little ones..
[4:39] <Plinky> Slimes are like one of my friends, they try to flying hug you into lava.
[4:39] <T4r4ntul4> dont hurt anyone
[4:39] <DatOneGuy> Ah the one that tried to push me in the water...
[4:39] <T4r4ntul4> thats cute plinky :P
[4:39] <DatOneGuy> WAsn't small, he was medium
[4:39] <Plinky> In fact, the only different between a slime and my friend is that my friend is a good singer.
[4:39] <DatOneGuy> so i haven't killed small ones yet :\/
[4:39] <Plinky> T4r4ntul4: It really isn't.

[4:42] <MikkoK> OMGOMG
[4:42] <Plinky> FlyingOvenOfDoom: Did you kill the small ones?
[4:42] <DatOneGuy> I'd join SPA (I haven't killed small ones yet!), but I think It's better to be Slime-neutral :
[4:43] <Vic> slimes are a part of the food chain
[4:43] <Demki> yep
[4:43] <MikkoK> i have 40 slimeballs because of slimes that have fallen from high
[4:43] <Vic> which goes as follows: Everything -> the player
[4:43] <DatOneGuy> Yay, I got lava :D
[4:44] <Demki> vic, nah, the player can survive anything
[4:44] <Vic> but yeah
[4:44] <Demki> lol

[4:59] <Demki> vic, advice, when breaking stuff underwater, don't move
[5:00] <Plinky> That made SPA angry.
[5:00] <Vic> advice
[5:00] <Vic> more like
[5:00] <Vic> there was no ground to stand on
[5:00] <DatOneGuy> That 's it, I fucking hate slimes
[5:00] <DatOneGuy> Forever
[5:00] <Demki> so vic, find a ground
[5:00] <Akai> It's amazing how much a reminder that mod/admin/ops are watching can change someone's behavior.
[5:00] <DatOneGuy> I'm deleting this map just so they can all fucking die
[5:00] <Vic> how
[5:00] <Vic> i'm underwater
[5:00] <Demki> =|

[5:17] <blaster> DatOneGuy, for ??600 in shops, I would get about half that
[5:17] <DatOneGuy> Yeah I know :\/
[5:17] <DatOneGuy> but it's used
[5:17] <Vic> reno: you should play a man's final fantasy game
[5:17] <blaster> Feel free to look for a better one
[5:17] <Vic> not those pansy games
[5:17] <DatOneGuy> He probably blew his load on the CPU a few times and said it was thermal glue
[5:17] <Vic> and by that im saying ff5
[5:18] <RenoFox> I can't get any maps for 5's castles
[5:18] <Shrub> FF5 was so good

[5:18] <blaster> Its new
[5:18] <sorre> I THOUGHT FINAL FANTASY STARTED WITH 7
[5:18] <DatOneGuy> I put 'New' on everything I sold on eBay
[5:18] <Shrub> what
[5:18] <DatOneGuy> It was all mildly used
[5:18] <DatOneGuy> Most people do
[5:18] <Shrub> DatOneGuy
[5:18] <DatOneGuy> It sells faster
[5:18] <Shrub> that's so slack
[5:19] <blaster> He has sold 14447 items
[5:19] <Vic> it's not slack it's very common
[5:19] <blaster> I doubt anyone could of used that many PCs
[5:19] <Shrub> Just because it's common doesn't mean it's not slack
[5:19] <DatOneGuy> That doesn't really make a difference :|
[5:19] <blaster> Or blow his load over that many
[5:19] <Shrub> If everybody started shoplifting
[5:19] <DatOneGuy> I doubt he sells just PCs
[5:19] <Shrub> would that make it legal?
[5:19] <blaster> unless its his hobby
[5:19] <DatOneGuy> You underestimate how many PCs I'd blow my load on
[5:19] <Vic> except shoplifting is outright illegal

[5:25] <blaster> Pointless war
[5:25] <blaster> over thomas
[5:25] <Plinky> This is true.
[5:25] <Roadcrosser> also bigger than small slimes hurt you
[5:25] <DatOneGuy> I don't even..
[5:25] <blaster> The guild of industry does not support your mindless violence over slimes
[5:26] <Roadcrosser> is it ok to kill these? (in SPA)
[5:26] <blaster> And will refuse to do business with you
[5:26] <Plinky> Yus.
[5:26] <Plinky> Blaster, I as the head, am not involved in protection or hunting of slimes.
[5:26] <DatOneGuy> But I need your business...
[5:26] <Roadcrosser> WHat if small slimes push you into lava?
[5:26] <blaster> Unless you wish to join the guild of industry
[5:26] <Pelum> remember i can still sanction you as i am a founder of the MMoFT
[5:26] <Plinky> Roadcrosser, just go SHA and kill them all?
[5:26] <Plinky> :D
[5:27] <Roadcrosser> if you in SPA
[5:27] <Roadcrosser> and then small sliems push you into lava
[5:27] <Roadcrosser> what happens then?
[5:27] <Kizzycocoa> hey, I just had a hell of an idea. what if slimes could mutate pigs to become creepers?
[5:27] <Roadcrosser> YES
[5:27] <Plinky> Hope to hell the slimes fall in the lava.
[5:27] <Roadcrosser> You said you wouldnt hunt/protect them
[5:28] <Kizzycocoa> destroy slimes and pigs to get creepers
[5:28] <Kizzycocoa> :D
[5:28] <Roadcrosser> I wonder why usually the player gets touched he looses lives

[6:54] <Roadcrosser> best way to annoy someone: have your entire inventory Lava buckets except for some cloth on your hands. Follow someone until he reaches a mine that slopes downwards. Pour lava around the edges.
[6:55] <Kokopure> but hopefully, it's able to be replicated
[6:55] <Kokopure> roadcrosser, I think they'll be like "why are your hands full of cloth"

[6:55] <Stealez> hide in the darkness then pop out and kill someone
[6:55] <Akai> because then they do it to you. With water

[6:56] <Hyst> could always have been a troll from the start.
[6:56] <Kokopure> Stealez, he said that Notch was giving out SMP invites in the channel.
[6:56] <Kokopure> which lead to massive floods

[6:56] <Jevon> oh
[6:56] <Dman757> Your honestly trying to find the dude that troll on 4chan.

[6:58] <Stealez> Its not just that
[6:58] <Kokopure> not all of 4chan is /b/, but a lot of it comes close.
[6:58] <Stealez> But everyone floods everything from /b/ to others like /v/
[6:58] <Kokopure> and /b/ does mix into everything every now and again.
[6:58] <Dman757> Sounds a little impossible and/or paranoid to me.
[6:59] <Kokopure> /u/ is a fairly secluded bunch in my experience, though.
[6:59] <Kokopure> aside from /u/ I only go to /vp/, though.

[7:12] <frogpen> didnt think so
[7:12] <Jevon> Its in the client...

[7:42] <Pelum> i take it they sell well o your server
[7:42] <Hyst> 1.06383g per minute :|
[7:42] <Hyst> Pel, They sell well on any mid to high pop server.
[7:43] <Budda> i bet wurm is worse...2 hours fishing for 100kg fish
[7:43] <Hyst> Put em in for 8-9g, 10g on weekends
[7:43] <Hyst> then you can basically go afk on the character for a month
[7:43] <Pelum> thats prolly why im on the lowest pop realm
[7:43] <Hyst> (a day)
[7:43] <Hyst> why?

[8:44] <So_Useless> Well, it won't be a problem forever. According to some recent research that I haven't personally read, but have heard about, the human population is evolving towards being more intellegent.
[8:44] <So_Useless> I don't get what selective pressure is driving that.
[8:44] <Ivorius> Wow
[8:44] <Miclee> From everything I've seen, I'd say it's going the opposite.
[8:44] <sorre> it's bullshit
[8:44] <sorre> we're not getting smarter
[8:44] <Ivorius> I'm the only one that kept beeing online the whole day till now ^^

[8:45] <sorre> you don't suppose that the autists are altering the curve?
[8:45] <Ph477> turns out 138 is fairly high
[8:45] <So_Useless> It's possible, Sorre, but would they drive it up or down?
[8:45] <sorre> up
[8:45] <C418> ...intellegent
[8:45] <Zeph> iq has got to be dropping
[8:45] <Zeph> i refuse to believe otherwise
[8:45] <sorre> high-functioning autistics can be very smart
[8:46] <sorre> they say 1 in 125 children is born autistic at this point
[8:46] <Hyst> trying to think of a decent minecraft challenge
[8:46] <sorre> i have to wonder if we have a whole hell of a lot of undiagnosed mild autists running around out there
[8:46] <So_Useless> Yeah, but most of them probably aren't high functioning. And, no matter how smart they are on the inside, if you can't get them to take the test, they can't effect the curve... so, yeah. Only the high functioning autists would effect the curve, I guess.
[8:46] <Ph477> i guess i'm a target example of high fucntioning autism
[8:47] <sorre> an increasing number of autism cases are high-functioning

[8:48] <So_Useless> Be right back. Bread is burning.
[8:49] <sorre> the reason for the interest in computers is for two main reasons
[8:49] <Ph477> well i can funtcion fine in the real world but i find trivial things that people don't think of that make me irrationally angry
[8:49] <sorre> one is the high degree of logic inherent in computers

[8:50] <Scrippy> I have a healthy social life
[8:50] <Ph477> noted
[8:50] <Scrippy> But I hate people.
[8:50] <sorre> also, given that they have problems reading unspoken social cues, such as body language, communication mediums like IRC are great for them, because it levels the playing field

[8:51] <Interman> get an outdoor hobby

[8:51] <sorre> i don't go outdoors much because i have very sensitive eyes
[8:51] <sorre> i do, however, have friends
[8:51] <Scrippy> Yes, I can't tell the difference between autists and non autists on the internet
[8:51] <Ph477> agreed azu

[8:51] <Scrippy> And I'm okay with this.
[8:51] <Scrippy> Huh what Dommys?
[8:51] <sorre> i'm a medically-diagnosed autist

[8:52] <Scrippy> do that like three times before he finally completes the damn thing.
[8:53] <Dommys> My wife does that.
[8:53] <Dommys> Not exactly that.. she just drops off mid sentence
[8:53] <Scrippy> Is that a condition, or just funky brain wiring?
[8:53] <Scrippy> He does that too.
[8:53] <Kamila> upon SMP release, let's have LAN party
[8:53] <Scrippy> But when I try to get him to finish it, that's what he does.
[8:53] <aszurom> I wish I had medically diagnosed tourettes, because then I could say what I'm actually thinking at work and not get fired
[8:53] <So_Useless> I just stumble on words while talking. I know the perfect word for what I want to say, but it just slips away from me... so I spent five or ten seconds trying to get it out, while the other person in the conversation offers equally valid words for what I wish to describe. But god damn it, my word must be said.
[8:53] <Dommys> "So I.. was going to... uhhhhh" Nothing for 2 minutes before my head feels like it's going to implode and then finally "wait what?"
[8:53] <Scrippy> A LAN party for a first-person autism simulator?

[8:54] <sorre> when you think about it...
[8:54] <Dommys> Or, get photoshop, and set up Grids.

[8:55] <Dommys> Grids will look just like Graph Paper, and you can draw anything you want using it :D

[11:34] <Cial> Skorchy, Shogun Total War was better
[11:34] <SireTRM> Ah. . . I'm making myself a slime-study area. This is will be interesting.
[11:35] <Stealez> Skorchy
[11:35] <Stealez> You win.
[11:35] <Stealez> Its decided.
[11:35] <tssguy123> there, i disabled it
[11:35] <Skorchy> ?
[11:35] <bearz> im gonna have a clan with my friend.. w're going to burn every stuff up and kill people.. >:3
[11:35] <Rawer> i know he's op but he's pissed anyway
[11:35] <Quatroking> shit
[11:35] <bearz> then we're gonna have lots of undeground bases etc
[11:35] <Skorchy> Define my victory?
[11:35] <csc> im just trying to figure out if its pointless searching for my work, which is lighted from the outside, and i still cant see it high above the actual map
[11:35] <Quatroking> I just crashed lmgtfy

[11:35] <Skorchy> As in, in the game or wha?
[11:35] <Cial> bearz, then im gonna kill you for killing people
[11:35] <Stealez> Spartans vs romans
[11:35] <Stealez> Each spartan equals 100 romans
[11:35] <destroyerx1> itll people say lots of underground bases
[11:35] <Stealez> Therefore you have over TRIPLE the power
[11:35] <bearz> yeah like you could do that in private servers >:I
[11:35] <Stealez> So you win.
[11:35] <Skorchy> lolialreadyconqueredrome
[11:36] <Skorchy> These fags are from scythia.
[11:36] <Stealez> Well
[11:36] <SireTRM> Takos_360, underground tunnel system. I've already contacted a primary slime spawn area, but they are currently contained. Now I build a facility to study them.
[11:36] <Stealez> Each spartan equals 500 sycthians
[11:36] <Stealez> so
[11:36] <destroyerx1> most servers will discourage pvp
[11:36] <destroyerx1> probably
[11:36] <Stealez> You win
[11:36] <Takos_360> Epic ._.
[11:36] <Stealez> Destroyers
[11:36] <destroyerx1> it will be too chaotic otherwise
[11:36] <destroyerx1> IMO
[11:36] <Stealez> Im going to join a discouraged pvp server
[11:36] <tssguy123> laal, sorry about that quatro.. i don't think i have any scripts loaded, but if it does that again boot me from the channel
[11:36] <asiekierka> Stealez: Me too
[11:36] <Skorchy> And I have a phalanx with a valley
[11:36] <Stealez> and hax in 1000 tnt
[11:36] <asiekierka> Stealez: Good luck
[11:36] <realg> hellos
[11:36] <Stealez> thanks.
[11:36] <Takos_360> Wish i could see how it looked like when it was done, SireTRM
[11:36] <realg> josrence44
[11:36] <realg> you rang?
[11:37] <SireTRM> Takos_360, I'll upload the save at some point

[12:18] <Kitoari> slimes are the new griefers
[12:18] <Stealez> otherwise it looks fine
[12:18] <Ensirum> BUT NOT THE ORIGINAL STUFF

[12:18] <Ensirum> none of the original death items were around

[12:19] <Kookee> sooo, who's got premade areas for smp?
[12:19] <Stealez> it took over 5 minutes
[12:19] <Stealez> to get to your spot then
[12:19] <Kizzycocoa> I have =D
[12:19] <Ensirum> they disappear after 5 inutes

[12:19] <Ensirum> when will notch add dye and spawnflags?
[12:19] <Stealez> 5 minute
[12:19] <geraldbrent> lol
[12:20] <Stealez> after you get within a certain range
[12:20] <Stealez> Ensirum
[12:20] <Stealez> most likely dye
[12:20] <Stealez> with a new plant
[12:20] <Stealez> like grapes
[12:20] <Ensirum> >grapes
[12:20] <Stealez> Spawn flags is a big maybe
[12:20] <Kitoari> ensirum: dye, yes. Spawnflags should be an option for admins, but otherwise no.
[12:20] <Ensirum> >plant
[12:20] <Ensirum> hahahah
[12:20] <rcfighter> Hopefully a fix for the Slime hitboxes comes first
[12:20] <zerocool> >ALCOHOL!
[12:20] <Stealez> RC
[12:20] <Kookee> cool. craft milk into cheese, and then craft grapes into wine
[12:20] <Ensirum> kitoari, i mean for you alone
[12:20] <Ensirum> your own spawn point
[12:20] <Stealez> That and the fact they spawn on peaceful
[12:20] <Kookee> >:3
[12:20] <Kitoari> ensirum: no.
[12:20] <Ensirum> he mentioned he'd let you be able to move your own spawn point with a flag
[12:20] <MikkoK> hello everybody!!

[12:20] <Ensirum> so what if i set up a base 32 million blocks away
[12:20] <MikkoK> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXsmGSnq3lE great song
[12:21] <Stealez> That would be able to abuse
[12:21] <Ensirum> am i screwed if i die?
[12:21] <Wtf> Anyone notice how the no-source archive for Cartographer seems to include the sourced archive for Cartographer complete with another copy of Cartographer?
[12:21] <Ensirum> how could it abuse?
[12:21] <Kitoari> maps will not be 32 million blocks wide in smp
[12:21] <Stealez> Go raiding and if you die close just set your spawn flag close
[12:21] <Stealez> before you die
[12:21] <rob`> I think notch is going to have to implement some kind of food buffing system - simply having different foods give different numbers of hearts is boring and doesn't support a complex farming system
[12:21] <Stealez> -_-
[12:21] <Stealez> Raiders would have total control
[12:21] <zerocool> we are going

[14:46] <xX-Darkebrz-Xx> Its the same name with or without the underscores.
[14:46] <csc> rob`: because its technically a non-renewable resource, but technically considering the fact that minecraft's limit for levels is about <insert number here>x the surface area of earth, there's always going to be coal in single player
[14:46] <destroyerx1> I like minecraft a lot more than IB now because I can develop for it
[14:46] <wolf_alex> destroy ib?
[14:46] <csc> but eventually, at some point, it'll be all used up or inaccessable

[14:47] <Genemos> ahh ok, and that is?
[14:47] <Darke> Google.
[14:48] <wolf_alex> google is your freind
[14:48] <csc> wolf_alex: well if you think about it this way, with the price per gig so cheap, the storage will increase by the time you need to expand your search for coal

[14:48] <csc> i built a computer specifically to play minecraft
[14:48] <Kitoari> map resets are more grating because of the massive work put into getting those resources
[14:48] <wolf_alex> csc you didnt see the post that noth said it would be 100 terebytes if its fully explored
[14:48] <wolf_alex> er
[14:48] <wolf_alex> I think
[14:49] <csc> some dipshit somewhere in the world will probably build a mainframe just to play minecraft
[14:49] <Quatroking> checkout my mad skillz
[14:49] <wolf_alex> quatro cause you can hack and play unfair?
[14:49] <Darke> Quatroking, would be more impressive if you actually dug it out
[14:49] <Dragoon> I'm going to make a slime army in SMP.
[14:49] <Quatroking> wolf_alex, cause I can build forever
[14:49] <Darke> Without infedit

[14:50] <Quatroking> burn down trees
[14:50] <Quatroking> that stuff
[14:50] <wolf_alex> lol you may be right csc
[14:50] <Quatroking> I don't really like to gather resources a lot in singleplayer survival, I prefer to just build a shitload of stuff

[14:52] <Quatroking> you can easily turn your existing mod in winter mode though
[14:52] <Quatroking> just turn over the switch using nbtedit
[14:52] <csc> so a world without snow, will never see snow, or is it just randomized when you load minecraft
[14:52] <Quatroking> warning: lakes will freeze forever
[14:52] <Quatroking> a world without snow will never see snow naturally
[14:52] <wolf_alex> anyone else notice that fiskie came outta nowhere andsaid ima greif o much :D

[14:54] <Quatroking> my first project in SMP will be recreating the Tibian city of Rookgaard
[14:54] <wolf_alex> fiskie wait what fingerprint reader?
[14:54] <Quatroking> um
[14:54] <Fiskie> Notch thought he fixed water griefing, however
[14:54] <Fiskie> Just flood a place with water, water springs EVERYWHERE
[14:54] <wolf_alex> no
[14:54] <wolf_alex> notch made a mistake then
[14:54] <Quatroking> minus the of
[14:55] <Fiskie> wolf_alex: it's integrated on the left side of the keyboard
[14:55] <Kitoari> Fiskie: you'll be needing a lot of iron
[14:55] <Wtf> Someone told me to use NBT Forge to tell which chunks these sectors are, but how would I do that? I don't see any acknowledgment of chunks in NBT Forge
[14:55] <wolf_alex> spiders need to place web

[15:08] <csc> yeah
[15:08] <Fiskie> I dunno
[15:08] <Fiskie> Stupid rule
[15:08] <jonnyabc> cuz ppl like to argue

[15:08] <Radon> because it breaks copyright
[15:08] <Radon> basically
[15:08] <Diablodoct0r> ^

[15:08] <Kitoari> radon: no, actually
[15:08] <Diablodoct0r> And because hacked clients are forbidden by Notch
[15:08] <csc> when its linked indirectly from minecraft.net

[15:09] <wolf_alex> anyone read the hunger games?

[15:09] <Diablodoct0r> Hacked client talk is disallowed
[15:09] <Radon> I'm pretty sure it breaks copyright terms
[15:09] <AzureAngelic> then why does he link to wom on the minecraft community page
[15:09] <Kitoari> radon: explain
[15:09] <Diablodoct0r> Notch is AGAINST the WoM client.

[15:09] <Fiskie> We need a non-nazi version of #minecraft
[15:09] <Kitoari> I asked him a couple days ago but I got the silent treatment
[15:09] <Radon> heil

[15:10] <Kitoari> really people stop comparing everything to nazis
[15:10] <AzureAngelic> this is the internet
[15:10] <AzureAngelic> everything is a nazi reference on the internet
[15:10] <csc> yknow, i find it hilarious that a supposidly banned client can be found by going on minecraft.net
[15:10] <AzureAngelic> truth
[15:10] <copyboy> no
[15:10] <Radon> Hitler is for the WoM client, are you?

[15:10] <AzureAngelic> hitler hated creepers
[15:10] <copyboy> ignore the fail +
[15:10] <AzureAngelic> therefore creepers are holy sacred beings
[15:10] <jonnyabc> lol copyboy
[15:10] <destroyerx1> wom client is specifically designed so that server owners can ban it on their servers
[15:10] <jonnyabc> ily
[15:11] <destroyerx1> it's not evil
[15:11] <Cial> Kitoari, well if you consider the segregation and hatred a of over half the minecraft community yes it is kinda nazi-ish
[15:11] <Kizzycocoa> I think the internet can be compared to nazis
[15:11] <Kizzycocoa> as well as america
[15:11] <AzureAngelic> well if nobody likes the client what about nbtedit
[15:11] <Kizzycocoa> and the scottish

[15:11] <ChJees> csc, recursion
[15:11] <csc> recursive minecraft client is recursive
[15:11] <ChJees> dammit
[15:11] <Tukiko> csc: ... running on a gameboy color
[15:11] <AzureAngelic> csc, make a minecraft liquid computing construct capable of playing minecraft

[15:12] <csc> AzureAngelic: i failed Wiremod 101
[15:12] <janger> imagine if a wom servers banned wom client on there servers
[15:12] <jonnyabc> CHAOS

[15:13] <Cial> Krysonian, welcome to the internet
[15:13] <Cial> they put -hax in the motd
[15:13] * Kito is now known as Kitoari
[15:13] <Cial> damn ninjas
[15:13] <AzureAngelic> yeah
[15:13] <janger> whats a motd
[15:13] <Kitoari> message of the day
[15:13] <sllide> i want something like gmod
[15:13] <sllide> but less resource demanding
[15:13] <AzureAngelic> the wom client hack is designed to intentionally not work on servers that put -hax in the intro message
[15:13] <Kitoari> the thing you see when you enter the server
[15:13] <Cial> o_o
[15:14] <janger> ohh cool
[15:14] <Cial> but thats not fool proof there is more than just the wom client
[15:14] <Kitoari> cial: most well known is important
[15:14] <AzureAngelic> basically they added it as a failsafe so 10-year-old script kiddies wouldnt download it and grief everybody
[15:14] <Kitoari> unless you're REALLY determined, you aren't gonna look for a diff. client
[15:15] <vede> Krysonian, uh, I think you read "Deep Thought" as "Deep Throat." Classy moves, Krysonian.
[15:15] <AzureAngelic> of course not kit
[15:15] <Kitoari> and slimes are not usually determined
[15:15] <AzureAngelic> if you were a real nerd you'd code your own
[15:15] <Cial> and then the client has been cracked by a few people so yea make sure your ops do their damn jobs
[15:15] <AzureAngelic> in basic

[15:15] <AzureAngelic> if you ask me griefing is really dependant on the kind of griefer
[15:15] <AzureAngelic> if some guy just comes in and spams the delete button everywhere he sucks
[15:16] <Fiskie> Ok I registered a non-nazi channel for later
[15:16] <Fiskie> Just in case 3:
[15:16] <AzureAngelic> if some guy comes into a pixel art server and hand-makes a 40x40x40 3D image of a wang he at least deserves a high five
[15:16] <vede> Fiskie, aren't most channels non-nazi channels?
[15:16] <Diablodoct0r> Radon

[15:17] <AzureAngelic> internet maturity is like when little kids take off all their clothes and run around in a towel saving their pets from themselves and singing superhero music
[15:18] <AzureAngelic> its the same sort of entitlement
[15:18] <So_Useless> ...
[15:18] <Fiskie> That sounds very pedophilic

[15:20] <AzureAngelic> i dunno
[15:20] <Fiskie> Griefing with Lava is a good idea too
[15:20] <Dommys> Anyone live streaming?
[15:20] <So_Useless> Taht would take like a whole map to be recognizable as hitler.
[15:20] <So_Useless> that*
[15:20] <AzureAngelic> thats the idea
[15:20] <Cial> Dommys, some one is always streaming
[15:20] <AzureAngelic> if theres genuine effort
[15:21] <AzureAngelic> and its not just delete everything
[15:21] <Cial> check out live stream or brocraft
[15:21] <janger> fiskie you anti-semitist fuk come to my town and call my grandfathers grave a jew when you might not even be around if he hadnt fought in ww2
[15:21] <AzureAngelic> its at least entertaining
[15:21] <So_Useless> I've never met a griefer that actually put forth effort of any kind.
[15:21] <Fiskie> janger: whatever
[15:21] <Dommys> Cial, I ask here, to see if anyone new is streaming. :D
[15:21] <So_Useless> I assumed they were incapable.

[15:22] <So_Useless> My grandfather is still alive. It seems like his condition has been deteriorating for years.
[15:22] <So_Useless> Get better or die, old man.

[15:26] <Kitoari> except his kidneys were failing....
[15:26] <Kitoari> ...
[15:26] <So_Useless> We should burn our dead for fuel, if it could be made economically feasible and wouldn't pollute the environment too much.

[15:26] <Dommys> Google "I Require Nutrients" if you're not already familiar.

[15:29] <Fiskie> Why would you care if you were already dead
[15:29] <So_Useless> I'd like my body stuffed in a sitting position and put into various restraunts.
[15:29] <Cial> there is no point in making a spectacle out of someones worst moment
[15:29] <So_Useless> Make a hidden camera show out of it.
[15:29] <Azathoth> hah
[15:29] <Cial> heh sell it to FOX?
[15:30] <Dommys> Cial, being dead isn't always guaranteed to be your worst momeny.

[15:30] <Kitoari> "Sir? Sir, what do you want?"
[15:30] <Dommys> What about when you were fapping to beastiality.
[15:30] <Kitoari> "OH MY GOD HE'S DEAD"

[15:44] <Siiseli> Cial, excuse me?
[15:44] <Cial> no but quagmire is a clam
[15:45] <Dommys> The word meme defines something that has been so used that it has become a meme.. at which point, it has been overused, and is no longer good.
[15:45] <SireTRM> Statements that seem internally contradictory.
[15:45] <Diablodoct0r> Hehe
[15:45] <So_Useless> Living dead is an oxymoron... until the zombies come for you.
[15:45] <Dommys> Therefor no meme is good, but a meme could have been good, at one point.

[17:46] <KillingSpree> xD
[17:46] <Chezhead> Maybe if you had a TNT spawner somehow and caused it to accelerate 2x as much ever 5 squares, with possibly some waypoints spreading ovber 5 chunks or so, you could possibly make a laser
[17:46] <Chezhead> laser of sorts
[17:46] <Hiiro> Making what?
[17:47] <Chezhead> You would have to have great timing with mulitple people at each waypoint activating TNT making it accelerate farther

[17:47] <Chezhead> It's possible, just takes a load of people, as you need to have percise timing on each waypoint.

[17:54] <Hiiro> Holy sex
[17:54] <rob`> yeah, the US Navy has been trying to get railguns into service for a while now as main ship guns
[17:55] <CyborgDragon> the smaller scale, gun types, require as much power as a car

[17:55] <rob`> they've got a lot of potential - high projectile energy-to-target, flat trajectory, ridiculously high velocity
[17:55] <CyborgDragon> which causes them to be very impractical
[17:55] <CyborgDragon> however, a large mounted railgun cannon
[17:56] <Conundrumer> the speed of that projectile is causing the air to combust
[17:56] <CyborgDragon> on a nuclear powered ship(carriers)
[17:56] <CyborgDragon> now that
[17:56] <Greo> yay slimes.
[17:56] <CyborgDragon> that is VERY possible
[17:56] <CyborgDragon> more than combust conundrumer
[17:56] <Greo> *waiting for Notch to implement something that involves the slime goo*
[17:56] <rob`> currently one of the big problems with railguns is plasma erosion of the coils - since the projectiles "ride" on a cushion of magnetic plasma, you don't get many shots
[17:56] <CyborgDragon> that isnt fire you're seeing, it's plasma
[17:57] <TrueWolves> wait
[17:57] <Diablodoct0r> There's a Secret Room less than 15 blocks away from my base
[17:57] <Conundrumer> well, damn
[17:57] <CyborgDragon> and that is why we're also trying to develop cold plasma
[17:57] <TrueWolves> that gun was only fired at a third of it's potential power?

[17:58] <Greo> i'm touching plasma right now
[17:58] <rob`> KillingSpree: just light a match and put your finger in the flame
[17:58] <rob`> there ya go
[17:58] <CyborgDragon> the problem with plasma is that it cools too fast
[17:58] <rob`> fire is basically a low-energy electron plasma
[17:58] <CyborgDragon> rob, that's not plasma
[17:58] * TrueWolves hands KillingSpree a bag of blood 'plasma'
[17:58] <rob`> isn't it?
[17:58] <KillingSpree> Rob' not even close
[17:58] <CyborgDragon> fire is the visual representation of energy released
[17:58] <CyborgDragon> by heat
[17:59] <Dormarth> Rob - Nope. Electrons aren't being stripped form the atoms.
[17:59] <KillingSpree> I actually didn't know plasma was visible
[17:59] <CyborgDragon> plasma is a superheated particle, to the point where it's past a gas

[17:59] <rob`> " You asked a good question, but the answer is--no, fire is not hot enough to create a plasma.
[17:59] <Chezhead> OK, I got it. With enough power, you could potentally shoot TNT so fast that no one could detect it coming. To the victim, it would just look like a random explosion. They wouldn't know where it would be coming from
[17:59] <CyborgDragon> and electrons start falling off
[17:59] <rob`> Most flames are yellow. The main reason is that flames contain little bits of burned material--bits which later form its smoke--and they get hot enough to glow. Hot solid materials always glow--for instance, the filament in a lightbulb. However ,glowing in yellow light does not require a very hot temperature. "
[17:59] <rob`> yeah, you're right
[17:59] <rob`> electric arc welding does create a plasma

[18:09] <CyborgDragon> xD
[18:09] <Greo> use flint and tinder then
[18:09] <Greo> but it's harder to use IMO.
[18:09] <Mizser> rob`: thats fantastic

[18:10] <Chezhead> Did anyone manage to make a railgun in my 5 minute absence?/
[18:10] <CyborgDragon> conundrumer: wind blows to the west, when you hit activate tnt, it falls slightly to the east
[18:10] <Azathoth> you can't make a railgun :\
[18:10] <DerSandman> lava put out my torches, can't really get down and place magma

[18:10] <Quatroking> Chezhead, dude, thats old
[18:10] <DerSandman> if i jump in the pit, i die in about a second

[18:11] <Greo> the room with all the slimes? move just barely into it but don't fall in
[18:11] <Conundrumer> does it move anywhere besides east?
[18:11] <DerSandman> and the 2x2 slimes can hit me through the door
[18:11] <KillingSpree> zeph: kinda.
[18:11] <Greo> and put some magma on the wall, it'll flow down
[18:11] <Greo> and melt the slimes
[18:11] <theholyduck> Zeph, happens to me aswell,
[18:11] <DerSandman> can't get too close to the door, they push me back

[18:11] <Greo> forget it then, gg to your fort.
[18:11] <Greo> :P
[18:11] <csc> or atleast, finite water to never stop flowing
[18:11] <DerSandman> that's why i hate slimes
[18:11] <Quatroking> cuntdrummer
[18:12] <DerSandman> they spawn all over my base

[18:12] <Greo> i've never had problems with slimes, cause I got buckets of magma and uber slime slaying skills.

[18:12] <theholyduck> *concerned
[18:12] <DerSandman> greo, that vid was taken after i killed alot of them too
[18:12] <CyborgDragon> the bug with water is that if there's water, ice, or glass below it, it wont fill in from two neighboring water blocks
[18:12] <Greo> also what mode are you playing on?
[18:12] <csc> you mean retardedly infinite finite water?

[18:14] <DerSandman> eating
[18:14] <DerSandman> oh
[18:14] <Zeph> hmm, the water bug is related to like drawing water from below the surface level, it doesnt bug when its only 1 deep water, but a lake gets the bug, annoying to fix
[18:14] <DerSandman> that's a skin
[18:14] <CyborgDragon> slayed, it's leather, not meat -.-
[18:14] <DerSandman> it's leather
[18:14] <csc> i spent eight hours playing alpha, and accomplished nothing but creating something that looks like randomness in woods

[18:14] <sLayed> ok ty
[18:14] <DerSandman> i know, leather looks like fried chicken

[18:14] <Darke> Put it in a furnace
[18:14] <Darke> I think
[18:14] <sLayed> i killed like 20 pigs and still got no meat :(
[18:14] <Darke> That makes 0 sense
[18:14] <csc> you craft it into leather armor iirc
[18:14] <DerSandman> skinny pigs
[18:14] <sLayed> indeed
[18:14] <CyborgDragon> the bug is if the "unfilled" space is on top of glass, ice, or more water
[18:14] <Vicrry> mmm
[18:15] <Randomnation> I always get 2 pieces of bacon when I set the pigs on fire without hitting them
[18:15] <CyborgDragon> then it wont fill in

[18:54] <TrueWolves> yes.
[18:55] <Boyofcheese> oh god, tnt cannons are epic
[18:55] <TrueWolves> Warlord from the forums gives a perfect explaination to the practicalness of (smaller) cannons)
[18:55] <TrueWolves> "Despite the cost of using 4 TNT to set off 1 at the enemy's base, it eliminates the possibility of counterattack, which is immensely valuable, and bypasses build permissions that might prevent using sand to climb up and place TNT on a tower or other high structure. Also, if done at night, such an assault would be a wonderful surprise attack. I'd be flattered if someone were to destroy my fort in such a fashion."
[18:55] <Boyofcheese> what thred is that?
[18:55] <Boyofcheese> thread
[18:55] <TrueWolves> TNT cannons, the answer to annoying forts with land-claim flags.

[18:56] <Boyofcheese> The pics suck
[18:56] <Boyofcheese> but the content is good
[18:56] <TrueWolves> if they happen, TNT cannons are much more awesome.

[18:57] <Boyofcheese> Forts are wet tissue compared to tnt cannons
[18:57] <Outpost> Can't destroy or build on someone's land? It defeats any kind of potential PvP.
[18:57] <TrueWolves> Becuase TNT cannons will be one of the only ways to combat them (and fair too, a random greefer is going to have trouble getting enough TNT for an extended assult)
[18:57] <Boyofcheese> Yeah
[18:57] <Boyofcheese> outpost I dont like land flags either,but i think theyd only slow down destruction
[18:58] <Boyofcheese> not stop it

[19:06] <funnyguy3D> why do you say that?
[19:06] <Conundrumer> csc no

[19:06] <funnyguy3D> then email him and complain if you care so much
[19:07] <Diablodoct0r> The snow don't even add properly on halfblocks

[19:31] <Kodaichi> Killingspree, if that's really how you feel then I guess I can accept that
[19:32] <Diablodoct0r> KillingSpree: on servers I admin, I don't actually put "op" disrespect into it's own category that much. If a person is being an ass, they're out; their opinions about an op are still just opinions

[19:37] <Outpost> sorre: You haven't seen the Philadelphia police force...
[19:37] <KillingSpree> @outpost I lol'd
[19:38] <TrueWolves> I won't kick for petty insults, the other ops may.
[19:38] <sorre> just like the police, a great many ops fall victim to power trips
[19:38] <Cial> mad with power
[19:38] <Naxza> A lot of people succumb to power trips nowadays. >_>
[19:38] <PuyoDead> Being an op is like being a janitor.

[19:44] <KillingSpree> Also, why don't creepers die in the sun T.T
[19:44] <Azure> yea >__>
[19:44] <Naxza> They're not undead abominations.
[19:44] <Naxza> They're just abominations.
[19:45] <Azure> they should explode
[19:45] <KillingSpree> Good point.
[19:45] <Azure> that would make holes everywhere
[19:45] <KillingSpree> Azure
[19:45] <Azure> lol
[19:45] <KillingSpree> that would be terrible
[19:45] <Azure> :D
[19:45] <KillingSpree> considering when you play on hard

[19:45] <KillingSpree> sometimes it sucks.
[19:46] <wolf_alex> I play on hard all the time
[19:46] <KillingSpree> The new plant should be referred to as Bamboo/Papyrus

[19:46] <wolf_alex> hi five!
[19:46] * wolf_alex raises hand
[19:46] * KillingSpree Virtual high fives alex
[19:46] <yellowrock> i said bamboo or cacti, as in those things that grow in sand
[19:46] <wolf_alex> now someone help me find the matterdom map :(
[19:46] <yellowrock> anyway
[19:46] <yellowrock> i think it's a bug or something
[19:46] <TrueWolves> I don't understand why we can't come up with creative names to things that we think are the same in are world as in the minecraft world but may be completely diffrent. 3=
[19:47] <funnyguy3D> its like a lego orgy
[19:47] <yellowrock> isn't bamboo/papyrus supposed to be common?
[19:47] <funnyguy3D> lol
[19:47] <wolf_alex> ok howbout
[19:47] <wolf_alex> blandicus
[19:47] <Naxza> It's easy to make a large amount of once you find some.

[19:47] <funnyguy3D> that lego house when valued as art was said to be worth 500000 pounds, holy crap!
[19:47] <yellowrock> i mean, it says the correct version and all, and it's a new map, but i don't see anything at all
[19:47] <wolf_alex> the matterdom anyone know where to find it?
[19:47] <KillingSpree> Lol funny still watching that video
[19:47] <wolf_alex> yellow its allways by water btw
[19:48] <Naxza> Dangitttt. If you're going to send me migrants, send more than three!
[19:48] <KillingSpree> Yellow
[19:48] <yellowrock> i know, but i haven't seen any
[19:48] <KillingSpree> I've never seen cactus
[19:48] <Conundrumer> I will still top that, truewolves
[19:48] <Conundrumer> in terms of efficiency
[19:48] <Naxza> Cacti and papyrus would do well to be less sparse, I'd agree.
[19:48] <KillingSpree> Conun
[19:48] <wolf_alex> anyone knows where to find the matterdom?

[19:49] <Conundrumer> 2 chunks?
[19:49] <KillingSpree> considering we have no idea what you're talking about
[19:49] <Naxza> Fairly, yes.
[19:49] <KillingSpree> No
[19:50] <Naxza> The other plant is, again, easy to make more of once you've found a unit of the stuff.

[19:52] <tehcid> who is
[19:52] <yellowrock> because they can.
[19:52] <tehcid> SC is awesome.

[19:53] <Naxza> I'm sick of Blizzard and Starcraft 2 since it's been delayed so many years.
[19:53] <tehcid> they built their entire telecommunications infrastructure because of SC
[19:53] <KillingSpree> Naxza, you can't really say that
[19:53] <Naxza> First Starcraft? No problem here.

[19:53] <KillingSpree> It's not like it's been in development since the first one
[19:54] <KillingSpree> Also, making a new engine takes time
[19:54] <Naxza> No, but it was announced a looong time ago, then delayed, then the beta for it was delayed, etc.
[19:54] <KillingSpree> making models takes time, making animations take time

[19:54] <CruelNoise> Hello #minecraft
[19:54] <Naxza> It all takes time, yes, but if it takes so long, why'd they show off footage two years before beta testing?
[19:54] <KillingSpree> Get people excited?
[19:55] * Blue_Protoman (Mibbit@ool-182d4e17.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #minecraft
[19:55] <KillingSpree> Naxza, I won't agree with you on SC2
[19:55] <KillingSpree> but if you make the same argument about D3 you will hear no complaints from me
[19:55] * NoaHall (Noah@host86-155-81-33.range86-155.btcentralplus.com) has joined #minecraft
[19:55] <Naxza> Not after moving the release date several times. I'm sure people wouldn't agree with me either. I'm just really, really frustrated with blizzard.
[19:55] <KillingSpree> Blizzard time is worse than valve time
[19:55] <KillingSpree> and I'm a fan of both
[19:55] <Conundrumer> how far can a 6 tnt booster cannon go?

[19:57] <Darke> >TF2
[19:57] <Darke> Like
[19:57] <Darke> 7 years
[19:57] <KillingSpree> Naxza, all to ensure perfect gameplay
[19:57] <KillingSpree> (Meaning other things besides bugs)
[19:57] <Darke> I'll get starcraft 2
[19:57] <Darke> Ive never played the first one though
[19:57] <KillingSpree> And also, footage to reassure people it's coming out
[19:58] <KillingSpree> Naxza one thing I FUCKING HATE is their aprils fools jokes.
[19:58] <KillingSpree> because they take so much time on those.
[19:58] <Naxza> That, and they're charging sixty bucks for the thing and there's another two campaigns coming yet. Guess the prices of those.
[19:58] * revenant (dlukes@pool-74-111-168-109.pitbpa.fios.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Segmentation fault)
[19:58] <KillingSpree> Naxza, those are for story junkies
[19:58] <Naxza> Oh, and DoTA? You'll probably have to pay for the Starcraft 2 equivalent.
[19:58] <KillingSpree> <Plays HON
[19:59] * Blue_Protoman (Mibbit@ool-182d4e17.dyn.optonline.net) has left #minecraft

[19:59] <Naxza> Russians? Some of them will have to buy months of Battle.Net time.
[19:59] <KillingSpree> Are you russian?
[19:59] <Naxza> No.
[19:59] <KillingSpree> Then why do you care?
[19:59] <sorre> just because you're not part of a maligned group doesn't preclude you from caring
[19:59] <Naxza> Because it goes against the very concept of Battle.Net, which was to provide a free medium for online gameplay.
[20:00] <Naxza> That, and rooskies are awesome.
[20:00] <KillingSpree> It's not like blizzard started the whole p2p thing in Asia
[20:00] <Dragoon> Well like they always say..."S nami Bog."
[20:00] <Darke> Yup like always

[20:02] <Naxza> Let's not forget Blizzard's new RealID plan.
[20:02] <KillingSpree> people knowing my real name?
[20:02] <KillingSpree> Fun
[20:02] <sorre> they appeared to step down from it, but it's not gone for good
[20:02] <Darke> Naxza, what?
[20:02] * Darke has not heard of this
[20:02] <KillingSpree> Sorre what do you mean step down from it
[20:03] <sorre> they backpedaled amidst massive public outcry
[20:03] <Naxza> Oh yeah, RealID. In order to get more connected to social networking systems, Blizzard's making it so you have to use their RealID system to use Battle.Net.
[20:03] * lobster_MB (michielbra@86.89.201.189) Quit (Quit: COCKBUSTER SLEEP MODE)
[20:03] <Darke> Why.
[20:03] <KillingSpree> Realid being your battle.net account
[20:03] <Darke> because my name for most things is Dick McCoke
[20:03] <Naxza> This system that asks you to put up your real name, info, etc.
[20:03] <Wtf> Of all chunks touching 0,0, which chunk is the 0,0 chunk? The south-east one?
[20:03] <KillingSpree> Naxza
[20:04] <Darke> Wtf, depends
[20:04] <KillingSpree> Guess what, blizzard has been asking that since 2005
[20:04] <Darke> You have to spawn on one of the corners
[20:04] <Darke> Of the chunks
[20:04] <Darke> Which is it
[20:04] <Wtf> I didn't spawn on 0,0 at all
[20:04] <Naxza> It's still really frikkin' unbelievable. I think I've made my point that I just don't like Blizzard, so I'm going to quit it now.
[20:05] <Wtf> I spawned multiple chunks away from 0,0
[20:05] * Nozickles (nathan@cpc1-oldh3-0-0-cust791.manc.cable.ntl.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[20:05] <Darke> 0,0 is usually on x and y axis
[20:06] <Darke> So Im guessing it would be in the middle of those chunks? I dont know
[20:06] <Wtf> It's not
[20:06] <Wtf> I know where the chunk edges lie
[20:06] <Darke> I dont know anything about how minecraft saves levels
[20:06] <Wtf> and I know where 0,0 is
[20:06] <Wtf> and it's right on a corner
[20:06] <Wtf> so 0,0 is probably the top-left corner of the 0,0 chunk, that makes sense to me
[20:06] <Wtf> but I was hoping to get confirmation before ruining my save

[20:36] <CruelNoise> But, TF, I WAS PARTICIPATING TOO!?!
[20:36] <CruelNoise> at least unban him, plz?
[20:37] <CruelNoise> he didn't deserve that.
[20:37] <TrueWolves> Alright, he gets a warning this time.
[20:37] <Outpost> Brodacious brodyeyo brah, don't be hating on the bro.
[20:37] <Areals> unban him, he at least deserved warning

[20:37] <KillingSpree> He doesn't deserve a warning
[20:37] <Areals> oh god damn no bots
[20:37] * TrueWolves normaly equates lots of spam with a bot attack
[20:37] <DatOneGuy> It's not up to you to say what he deserves.
[20:37] <TrueWolves> When I saw most of my screen with spam, my instinct was ban-kick.

[20:39] <CruelNoise> Do it, TF
[20:39] <Naxza> Kicking does the same job.
[20:39] <DatOneGuy> Not always
[20:39] <CruelNoise> autorejoin?
[20:39] <Dvc> Thanks for unbanning me
[20:39] <DatOneGuy> And autojoin is bannable so it's the same fucking deal
[20:39] <DatOneGuy> Although according to the rules it's usually not a permanent ban
[20:39] <CruelNoise> dvc, he was just going to ban you for 24 hours
[20:39] <CruelNoise> i convinced him that a shorter warning was better
[20:40] <Dvc> Thats a long ban
[20:40] <Kitoari> not really
[20:40] <Dvc> Sorry

[21:06] <DatOneGuy> Or am I doing something wrong...
[21:06] <Dvc> Sadly, I cant find a download
[21:06] <DatOneGuy> I click 9 or 0, or 1, or 2, and nothing happens
[21:07] <cardgame> Visualizer has issues sometimes
[21:07] <DatOneGuy> Wow that's badass
[21:07] <DatOneGuy> That would be an awesome pack to play with
[21:07] <cardgame> it froze when I was scrolling around one time, and sometimes it won't load any maps
[21:07] <DatOneGuy> I hope there's a way to make sure everyone uses the same pack, would be col :P
[21:07] <DatOneGuy> So you'd have to force visuals on everyone on your server
[21:08] <Canebrake> hmm...
[21:08] <Naxza> I can imagine, texture packs could probably be temporary files downloaded through the server.
[21:08] <Canebrake> it would be nice,notch needs to add it :P
[21:08] <DatOneGuy> Yeah would be nice :P
[21:08] <Dvc> I was going to host a post-apoc build server
[21:08] <TrueWolves|Busy> Could be an options thing "Use personal skin, use server skin"
[21:08] <Dvc> but
[21:08] <Naxza> Let's wait 'til we get SMP first.
[21:08] <DatOneGuy> I'd hate to make something like this video, and someone comes ina nd it looks like shit because they're using regular

[21:10] <TrueWolves|Busy> It be really awesome for luntic Lua scripters, 2 server side skins for a normal and "Eversed" (get the referince?) map where mobs act diffrently towards you (and look vastly diffrent) depending on which skin the server is showing you at the momment, with certain portals or items or what have you switching between the skins (with both loaded to make it faster)
[21:10] <TrueWolves|Busy> That be more a server susphific scripted set of events though.

[21:13] <Traviskolber> So Notch listens to this server when he works for questions and suggestions?
[21:13] <Areals> we live in an irc channel of contradictions
[21:13] <Areals> no
[21:13] <Areals> he has a google thing for suggestions
[21:13] <TrueWolves|Busy> He visits this channel once every 2~3ish weeks
[21:13] <TrueWolves|Busy> He doesn't look for suggestions though.
[21:13] <TrueWolves|Busy> He perfers to just hang out (not that it ever happens anymore. 3=)
[21:14] <TrueWolves|Busy> by it not happening I mean he gets spamed with questions anyway (though happily answers them when able, he quickly ends up realising he's being distracted from programing and focuses on that instead)
[21:14] <Traviskolber> I thought there was a channel that he listened to? O.o
[21:14] <TrueWolves|Busy> He's a user of this channel like you or me, he just owns this channel is all.
[21:14] <CruelNoise> Oh, was notch here?
[21:14] <sorre> well, that was horse shit
[21:15] <sorre> had to tinker with mineedit to get myself unstuck
[21:15] <sorre> ended up killing myself
[21:15] <Areals> sorry man
[21:15] <CruelNoise> Only every couple weeks?
[21:15] <Areals> one of the things i really hate
[21:15] <sorre> i lost some shit, but at least i'm not stuck anymore
[21:15] <CruelNoise> He used to come here pretty much every day...
[21:16] <TrueWolves|Busy> He used too ._.
[21:16] <Traviskolber> Meh.
[21:16] <Manomow> But really, does anyone know how to advertise my map more and have it critisised?
[21:16] <Dvc> He also made this, smp
[21:16] <Traviskolber> I wonder what he has in store for us this week.
[21:16] <Dvc> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JuaUm4hOco&feature=related
[21:16] <Traviskolber> What I find amazing is that he made this, all alone, in only one year from scratch.
[21:16] <Areals> manomaw: forums mostly
[21:16] <Traviskolber> Manomow, forums.
[21:16] <Traviskolber> I was one of the testers, remember?
[21:17] <TrueWolves|Busy> Notch's programing speed is fucking insane
[21:17] <Traviskolber> :P
[21:17] <Traviskolber> I know.
[21:17] <TrueWolves|Busy> He types like 80 wpm, I've seen it >.>
[21:17] <TrueWolves|Busy> more sometimes.
[21:17] <Traviskolber> An.
[21:17] <Traviskolber> *Ah.
[21:17] <Traviskolber> Fast typist.
[21:17] <Traviskolber> Close to me.
[21:17] <TrueWolves|Busy> Fast typist who knows his way around code very well.
[21:17] <Traviskolber> I can reach 100 under pressure x.x
[21:17] <cardgame> I type 101wpm according to a test
[21:18] <Traviskolber> For casually typing without mistakes, I type at like 50-60 WPM.
[21:18] <Areals> >he codes
[21:18] <TrueWolves|Busy> Not to mention he quit his real job to work on Mojang Specifications full time.
[21:18] <CruelNoise> I was just reading about Starcraft
[21:18] <cardgame> of course I normally type much slower to avoid typos (not that I do much of those anyway) and also to relax my fingers
[21:18] <Areals> any self respecting coder types like a mother fucker
[21:18] <Traviskolber> But if I abandon fixing mistakes and I don't care about grammar, I just go nuts and reach 105 wpm sometimes.
[21:18] <Traviskolber> Starcraft 2 is awesome.
[21:18] <Traviskolber> I played the beta.
[21:18] <Zode> typing code is slower because of ()?!=/" etc marks :I
[21:18] <Manomow> I alreay put it on the forums here Anyone know how to futher advertise and get cirtsism on my map? http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=20133&p=365815#p365815
[21:18] <TrueWolves|Busy> So basicly, until he starts another game, he's working on minecraft almost full time.
[21:18] <CruelNoise> Apparently professional starcraft players (read: koreans) can do 300 APM
[21:18] <Zode> and those spaces.. and {}... >_>
[21:18] <Naxza> If I mistype something, I HAVE to fix it. I don't even think about it, I just fix it.
[21:18] <Traviskolber> Well, TrueWolves, he HAS earned a lot of money...
[21:18] <Areals> it just means typing words is easier
[21:18] <Manomow> oops
[21:18] <Traviskolber> 20,000 purchases and each is $13.
[21:18] <Manomow> im ment
[21:19] <TrueWolves|Busy> Travis, he also has payed a LOT in taxes. X3
[21:19] <cardgame> travis
[21:19] <Manomow> I already put it on the forums
[21:19] <cardgame> your stats are way out of date
[21:19] <Traviskolber> True, 60%.
[21:19] <cardgame> there were 35,000 purchases earlier today
[21:19] <Naxza> Manomow, you're advertising again. =|
[21:19] <Areals> <cardgame> there were 35,000 purchases earlier today
[21:19] <Areals> no way
[21:19] <Areals> oh wait i thought you meant today alone
[21:19] <cardgame> 50-60% go to tax, 10-20% go to paypal
[21:19] <Traviskolber> 50% for Sweden and 10% for paypal.
[21:19] <Traviskolber> And actually 35,000 purchases.
[21:19] <Traviskolber> That is STILL a lot of money.
[21:19] <TrueWolves|Busy> Manomow, the best way is to become a liked and contributing member of the chat

[21:20] <CruelNoise> So, Truewolves, were YOU in the SMP test?
[21:20] <TrueWolves|Busy> No.
[21:20] <CruelNoise> K
[21:20] <Dvc> Anyone have a spare server up and running?
[21:20] <Animator> 'http://www.effectgames.com/demos/canvascycle/
[21:20] <CruelNoise> What for?
[21:20] <Animator> Holy balls.
[21:20] <DatOneGuy> How does the SMP testing even work?
[21:20] <TrueWolves|Busy> I was sick and slept the day of the test, and I'm still sick now.
[21:20] <Areals> why do green globs still exist in peaceful mode? fuuuu
[21:20] <DatOneGuy> That's nice as hell Animator o_o
[21:20] <Dvc> How does the SMP testing even work?
[21:20] <Dvc> You enter code
[21:20] <cardgame> Minecraft is doing pretty damned well for a game that has no advertising budget and is still in damned Alpha
[21:20] <Dvc> then get smp
[21:20] <CruelNoise> Animator, what is that?
[21:20] <Dvc> :v:
[21:20] <CruelNoise> Exactly?
[21:21] <sorre> the game is just that good
[21:21] <DatOneGuy> Right, when you enter said code, you enter the only SMP server, or is that to set one up or something?
[21:21] <cardgame> yeah :)
[21:21] <TrueWolves|Busy> you enter the invite code from Notch and it directs you to the server not unlike creative now.
[21:21] <DatOneGuy> Ah, okay
[21:21] <Animator> It's sex in 256 colors, CruelNoise.
[21:21] <cardgame> lol
[21:21] <CruelNoise> Sounds good enough to me~
[21:21] <Traviskolber> Has testing for SMP begun yet or?
[21:21] <cardgame> lol, I don't like Chrome
[21:21] <Dvc> yes
[21:21] <cardgame> ie8 is faster :D
[21:21] <DatOneGuy> >ie8
[21:21] <DatOneGuy> no thanks
[21:21] <Dvc> Get out
[21:21] <DatOneGuy> Opera or Firefox for me :P
[21:22] <TrueWolves|Busy> There was some light testing that ended in an server crash from memory leak.
[21:22] <Traviskolber> I'd use IE, but Youtube on it broke :(
[21:22] <Areals> holy shit 6k hours in pixelartpaint
[21:22] <CruelNoise> Did someone seriously just vouch for IE?
[21:22] <DatOneGuy> Currently strongly preferring firefox
[21:22] <cardgame> ie8 is the fastest browser of every one I've tried
[21:22] <Traviskolber> So I use Chrome.
[21:22] <cardgame> including firefox
[21:22] <Traviskolber> So I use Chrome.
[21:22] <cardgame> and chrome
[21:22] <cardgame> and opera, and safari,
[21:22] <cardgame> IE8 comes out on-top
[21:22] <Areals> opera is fast
[21:22] <DatOneGuy> IE8 is so slow...
[21:22] <DatOneGuy> that microsoft doesn't even say it's fast
[21:22] <Areals> because it's barebones
[21:22] <cardgame> You guys must have fail computers then
[21:22] <cardgame> my IE8 is fast

[21:24] <BATLORD> and the floor is cobble/wood/wool so no slimes spawning in my base
[21:24] <TrueWolves|Busy> green I think is other mibbit users, red text I think means the mibbit user is typing, a silver star is someone who can chat when the channel is muted, and a gold star is an op.

[21:24] <Darke> Lol mibbit
[21:25] <Darke> Are you guys really using mibbit
[21:25] <Golden> or Voice
[21:25] <BATLORD> people tare talking

[21:25] <TrueWolves|Busy> Darke, about 50% of the channel uses mibbit now ._./
[21:25] <Darke> :(
[21:25] <Traviskolber> So wait, red is typing.
[21:25] <Darke> I remember when there were like
[21:25] <Golden> Yes
[21:25] <Darke> 100 or so people
[21:25] <Traviskolber> But what are the stars?
[21:25] <Darke> That was awesome
[21:25] <Traviskolber> Admins?
[21:25] <TrueWolves|Busy> yes Travis
[21:25] <Golden> Red is typing
[21:25] <Darke> ops
[21:25] <CruelNoise> True, maybe Gold is IRCOP?
[21:25] <Traviskolber> Ok.
[21:25] <Traviskolber> And the people in dark green are official members and the light green are guests or something?
[21:25] <TrueWolves|Busy> Gold is op, silver is half op I think Cruel. (this server doesn't have half ops)
[21:25] <cardgame> light green are afk
[21:25] <cardgame> dark green have chatted in past 15 mins or so
[21:25] <CruelNoise> Travis
[21:25] <Darke> Send everyone with a gold star horse porn to get into their club
[21:26] <TrueWolves|Busy> Travis, use something that is not mibbit.
[21:26] <Traviskolber> Ah, I see.
[21:26] <CruelNoise> =F
[21:26] <Animator> Darke, don't say that.
[21:26] <TrueWolves|Busy> mibbit is slow. 3=
[21:26] <CruelNoise> hey, TrueWolves
[21:26] <zerocool> even telnet
[21:26] <zerocool> is better then mibbit
[21:26] <CruelNoise> Can i have a star?
[21:26] <Darke> Animator, :(
[21:26] <Traviskolber> Why, how, and give me a link.
[21:26] <Golden> Er
[21:26] <sorre> man, these fucking slimes
[21:26] <Banger> ER!
[21:26] <cardgame> Animator doesn't like horse porn
[21:26] <Darke> Traviskolber, XChat 2
[21:26] <TrueWolves|Busy> Traviskolber, google Xchat or mIRC
[21:26] <sorre> i've got two and a half stacks of slime goo from killing slimes on the way down
[21:26] <Golden> mIRC is pretty good.
[21:26] <TrueWolves|Busy> Those are the 2 biggest clients.
[21:26] <Animator> I LIKE TO BE STROOOOONG but no horse porn, please.
[21:26] <cardgame> mIRC fails for me
[21:26] <Darke> Xchat xchat xchat
[21:26] <Golden> But 20 bucks for registration.
[21:27] <Golden> I think.
[21:27] <f> http://www.silverex.org/news/ < compile of XChat2 without the "buy me" popups
[21:27] <TrueWolves|Busy> mIRC is free Golden.
[21:27] <cardgame> I can't seem to get it to freaking work
[21:27] <TrueWolves|Busy> the 30 day trial is false
[21:27] <CruelNoise> Animator likes little girls masturbaing with mushrooms
[21:27] <Golden> Whattt
[21:27] <DatOneGuy> Need iron to get redstone? :s
[21:27] <Golden> I failed then, I paide for registration.
[21:27] <CruelNoise> but that's just his personal preference.
[21:27] <cardgame> mushrooms you say?
[21:27] * TrueWolves|Busy has used it for almost 900 days, the 30 days ran out a long time ago
[21:27] <Traviskolber> CruelNoise, o.o
[21:27] <Darke> Golden, did you really
[21:27] <Golden> Lol...
[21:27] <zerocool> after 30 days the splash screen is lengthened
[21:27] * CruelNoise was kicked from #minecraft by TrueWolves|Busy
[21:27] <DatOneGuy> mIRC is free, it's just pester-ware
[21:27] <Animator> CruelNoise, that's too far.
[21:27] <Golden> Didn't know, I freaked out.
[21:27] * CruelNoise (cruelnoise@67-43-142-1.border7-dynamic.dsl.sentex.ca) has joined #minecraft
[21:27] <DatOneGuy> You can hack that if you want with cheat engine, and even then it keeps lasting
[21:27] <CruelNoise> Truewolves, I must say I agree.
[21:28] <Golden> And paid.
[21:28] <cardgame> Animator you were a bit late
[21:28] <cardgame> lol
[21:28] <CruelNoise> I regret saying it.
[21:28] <zerocool> err, or you can roll your date back
[21:28] <zerocool> because it uses a registry key
[21:28] <Darke> Or you can use XChat
[21:28] <Golden> :P
[21:28] <DatOneGuy> Xchat has a few issues that makes it not as good as mIRC
[21:28] <DatOneGuy> But it's still good for casual IRCing
[21:28] <Darke> Like?
[21:28] <DatOneGuy> Colors are teh sux on it
[21:28] <DatOneGuy> I do love the button channels though...
[21:28] <Darke> no.
[21:28] <DatOneGuy> I hate mIRC's tree
[21:28] <DatOneGuy> HATE
[21:28] <Darke> You can change those anyways
[21:28] <CruelNoise> Animator, these things are really pretty.
[21:28] <PuyoDead> I want to be able to combine features of XChat, and mIRC.
[21:28] <cardgame> I can't get mIRC to wIRC
[21:29] <CruelNoise> What exactly are they?
[21:29] <cardgame> (haha punny)
[21:29] <DatOneGuy> So, do I need iron to get redstone, or is stone eonugh?
[21:29] <PuyoDead> And mIRC's "tree" can be changed.
[21:29] <zerocool> Puyo, little bit of winapi knowledge and networking.. your own custom client within a week
[21:29] <cardgame> redstone req's iron
[21:29] <zerocool> and suited to your needs
[21:29] <Naxza> You need iron
[21:29] <DatOneGuy> Gay :(
[21:29] <PuyoDead> And my almost total lack of programming skills.
[21:29] <DatOneGuy> Oh well I'll get it later
[21:29] <Traviskolber> Ironz.
[21:29] <cardgame> as does gold, and diamond
[21:29] <DatOneGuy> I have iron but don't want to cook it >.> yet
[21:29] <zerocool> it's a nice hobby to pick up

[21:32] <chariot> You can set nick colors for specific nicks manually with mirc
[21:32] <cardgame> I made Golden silver.
[21:32] <chariot> although its a bit of a chore
[21:32] <PuyoDead> True, that it is.
[21:32] <chariot> not really worth the effort

[22:07] <Vicrry> Useless, if there's proper commentary along with the game it can be fun

[22:07] <cardgame> i am back
[22:07] <So_Useless> I've heard of them but never watched one.

[22:08] <DatOneGuy> I'm not a fan really, but heh
[22:08] <Naxza> All kinds of Let's Plays- Video, screenshot, etc.
[22:08] <Naxza> The Pokemon Blue one was really good.

[22:15] <Lutin> cardgame: disappointed* even though it ruins the meme
[22:15] <Manomow> 1.I was building a book store 2.I dont have a mic, only in the laptop downstairs
[22:16] <cardgame> you cannot grammar nazi a meme. >:(
[22:16] <DatOneGuy> Don't stream them :'(
[22:16] <Lutin> I just did.
[22:16] <TheCameraWorks> Oh I see what you did there >_>
[22:16] <cardgame> IT IS UNPOSSIBLE
[22:16] <Vicrry> Useless, it's a terrible game. Still better a lot of trash on Flash, but not great. Is more of a joke than a real game
[22:16] <Lutin> impossible*
[22:16] <TheCameraWorks> Grammar Nazi is a meme >_>
[22:16] <cardgame> lolzzzzzzz
[22:16] <cardgame> that was intentional
[22:16] <DatOneGuy> >implying calling something a meme makes it a meme
[22:16] <Lutin> I am aware.
[22:17] <Vicrry> Also, be sure to listen to the ending credits tune on Burn the rope - more effort went into the credits than the game :P
[22:17] <sorre> >milhouse
[22:17] <CruelNoise> I think that giving something the official title of meme takes away the charm of memes
[22:17] <cardgame> maybe press refresh and start again!
[22:17] <TheCameraWorks> Like longCat :D
[22:17] <DatOneGuy> >implying milhouse isn't a meme
[22:17] <CruelNoise> It's barely a meme if what you do is go to KYM and research it.
[22:17] <cardgame> yeah
[22:17] <So_Useless> I listened to it, and I get the whole parody thing. I just disagree that being funny means it's a good game. It's just my opinion, though. I won't argue it.
[22:17] <DatOneGuy> >KYM
[22:17] <DatOneGuy> Gtfo.

[22:52] <Mastranios> I just started playing, but i must say one of the best games ive ever played
[22:52] <TrueWolves> They use redstone, watersprings, shaped charges, and TNT to create reuseable cannons with high accuracy and in some cases insane range.

[22:56] <Soviet> 3 TNTs surely will be expensive
[22:56] <TrueWolves> the most basic non-cheat cannon only uses 3 TNT
[22:56] <Soviet> truevolves, let me make that for you
[22:57] <Soviet> also, cobble stone and mossy one are the same against TNT
[22:57] <Skorchy> I think notch is high.

[23:06] <Banger> Hello folks, should I buy minecraft? i figured the best location to ask is in the offical minecraft irc channel
[23:06] <Skorchy> Mastra, Im in idaho though.
[23:07] <sorre> what do you think we're going to say?
[23:07] <Whaleboobs> Banger, Heeeell yeeah

[23:07] <Banger> I like modifying trains :D
[23:07] <Canebrake> And Do you like running away from explodie type devices?!
[23:07] <Skorchy> Banger, do what I did.
[23:08] <Skorchy> Its a 12.50 game.
[23:08] <Banger> i used to have a crapload of legos untill a bowl of icecream ruined a bunch of them
[23:08] <Banger> so i threw them all away
[23:08] <Canebrake> if the answer to all that is yes i'd say it's probably a good buy.
[23:08] <sorre> think of what else you could buy with $13
[23:08] <Skorchy> Banger, its 12.50 and it goes towards notch making vikings in his spare time.
