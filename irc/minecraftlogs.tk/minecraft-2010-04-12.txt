[0:00] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[0:00] <Quatroking> Cheeseyx, how so

[0:00] <Cheeseyx> I had to

[0:01] <Quatroking> no reboot yo
[0:01] <Cheeseyx> Ah
[0:01] <Cheeseyx> Weird
[0:01] <Cheeseyx> I can't wait until FF has tab isolation
[0:01] <vurtual> you mean like
[0:01] <Quatroking> its probably because mozilla is like "oh shit quatroking is downloading this DAAAAAYUM
[0:01] <vurtual> porn mode
[0:01] <Cheeseyx> And can enable/disable add-ons without restarting
[0:01] <Cheeseyx> No
[0:01] <vurtual> what kinda tab isolation
[0:01] <Quatroking> I remember the handy-dandy history deleter button on netscape
[0:01] <Quatroking> perfect for hiding away my porn
[0:01] <Cheeseyx> I mean if one tab crashes, the rest are fine
[0:02] <vurtual> it's getting there
[0:02] <Cheeseyx> FF lets you delete specific sites from your history
[0:02] <vurtual> also install two firefoxen
[0:02] * Rooster (chatzilla@pool-74-111-197-38.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:02] <Rooster> You people!
[0:02] <Rooster> Entertain me
[0:02] <Cheeseyx> Okay
[0:02] <Quatroking> netscape made mozilla which made netscape which made firefox
[0:02] <Ten_Tacles> Vurtual
[0:02] <vurtual> Mein Firf??uxenn
[0:02] <Quatroking> fact
[0:02] <vurtual> HITLER USED FIREFOX
[0:03] <vurtual> ^proof there
[0:03] <Cheeseyx> lol
[0:03] <Ten_Tacles> Can you make peace with the underground civilizations?
[0:03] <Cheeseyx> Hitler gave to charity
[0:03] <vurtual> Ten_Tacles
[0:03] <vurtual> make them kill hostiles
[0:03] <Cheeseyx> Therefore Charity donors use FF
[0:03] <Ten_Tacles> Duh
[0:03] <Rooster> Hitler was also a vegetarian
[0:03] <Quatroking> Ten_Tacles, you mean like in Gurrenn Lagann
[0:03] <sllide> god damnit i can only find 0.31 D:
[0:03] <vurtual> once any of them attacks a fellow hostile
[0:03] <Ten_Tacles> I don't want to kill them
[0:03] <vurtual> that one becomes peaceful
[0:03] <bildramer> .....
[0:03] <vurtual> per-unit basis
[0:03] <Ten_Tacles> (Yet)
[0:03] <vurtual> sllide, discussing warez on esper!
[0:03] <Ten_Tacles> Uh
[0:03] <vurtual> SAUND ZE ALAHMMM
[0:03] <Cheeseyx> Therefore, to not be hitler, you must eat only meat, use only IE6, and never give to charity
[0:03] <vurtual> ALAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHM
[0:04] <Quatroking> sllide, what do you mean
[0:04] <Cheeseyx> God, Most americans are nowhere near hitler
[0:04] <vurtual> Cheeseyx, hitler did comparisons.
[0:04] <Cheeseyx> DAMMIT!
[0:04] <vurtual> HITLER CALLED AMERICANS UNHITLERY TOO
[0:04] <Cheeseyx> Hitler breathed!
[0:04] <Quatroking> america made some goddamn anti-nazi movies
[0:04] <Quatroking> disney yay
[0:04] <Quatroking> http://www.metacafe.com/watch/2195704/walt_disney_banned_donald_duck_nazi_cartoon/
[0:04] <vurtual> also Quatroking be careful with those emo chicks
[0:04] <Cheeseyx> Disney is really racist/sexist/etc.
[0:05] <bildramer> Hitler used Firefox
[0:05] <bildramer> haha.
[0:05] <Griskard> No
[0:05] <vurtual> sometimes they're the I DON'T CARE type, who honestly don't care

[0:05] <Griskard> But he still didnt get laid
[0:05] <vurtual> well trying that in public would be a bad idea
[0:06] <vurtual> Hitler used Firf??uxenn.
[0:06] * Hedious (His_Ugline@62-20-188-142-no30.tbcn.telia.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:06] <vurtual> Also fun thing to note, in Medal of Honor: Frontline
[0:06] <vurtual> There's a sign, pointing out cars, labelled "Furherwagens"
[0:06] <vurtual> Which means "Hitlercars"
[0:06] <vurtual> WE MUST HURRY TO THE HITLERCARS
[0:07] <CruelNoise> EA sucks.
[0:07] <vurtual> ea does good nintendo console games
[0:07] <vurtual> no way to have fancy DRM or anything
[0:07] <vurtual> subpar graphics are okay there
[0:07] <vurtual> only the better ones get ported

[0:08] * Kokopure (Kokopure@richard-a-king-2.umeres.maine.edu) has joined #minecraft
[0:08] <vurtual> It was like goldeneye sorta, but with sneaking and bond stuff.
[0:08] <sppt> vurtual, fuhrer doesn't necesarrily mean hitler, yano
[0:08] <vurtual> sppt, but hitlercars sounds funnier.
[0:08] <CruelNoise> nightfire was okay.
[0:08] <sllide> oh shi-
[0:08] * sllide hides
[0:08] <sppt> yeah ok, but it doesnt really mean hitler :P
[0:08] <vurtual> Loved playing that and still can go back and have some fun
[0:09] <vurtual> It's goldsrc btw.
[0:09] <vurtual> Too bad EA was directly involved... wait
[0:09] <vurtual> has anyone figured out mapping for nightfire
[0:09] <CruelNoise> what IS goldsrc?
[0:09] <vurtual> it's waht source was
[0:09] <vurtual> back in 1998
[0:10] <Rooster> My Goldsrc is broken
[0:10] <Rooster> WHO WANTS TO HELP ME?
[0:10] <CruelNoise> wat. valve was involved in nightfire?
[0:10] * Dysgalt (Mibbit@70.114.168.148) has joined #minecraft
[0:10] <CruelNoise> or what?
[0:11] <vurtual> no
[0:11] <vurtual> It was on goldsrc though
[0:11] <vurtual> oh, and gearbox was involved
[0:11] <vurtual> but it was never in the opening sequences or anything
[0:11] <vurtual> never knew that until just now when reading forum posts from 2002
[0:11] <CruelNoise> hmm.
[0:11] * Kawa (fff@66-230-80-236-rb1.fai.dsl.dynamic.acsalaska.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:11] <CruelNoise> i love forums that keep threads of that age open-posting.
[0:13] <vurtual> ahaha
[0:13] <vurtual> "GBX doesn't specifically owe it to Valve to give them the features and as we've seen Valve has been working of WC/Hammer on their own taking it in a different path so that it could be used for future releases (TF2....hahaha, yeah if it ever comes out)"
[0:13] <vurtual> I wonder what they think now
[0:13] <bildramer> lo.
[0:14] <bildramer> l.
[0:14] * sirzo (zolofto@66-190-48-45.dhcp.mdsn.wi.charter.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:14] <bildramer> :|
[0:14] * CruelNoise is out of the loop and does not understand
[0:14] <vurtual> CruelNoise
[0:14] <vurtual> TF2 was in development for a long time.
[0:14] <CruelNoise> okay.
[0:14] <Marach> wow, sequel thread is receiving positive feedback.
[0:14] <vurtual> Like, TFC was ported in entirely during TF2's devtime
[0:14] <Marach> we have to do that again sometime
[0:15] <vurtual> yay I made something with positive feedback
[0:15] <vurtual> NEXT STEP: EBAY
[0:15] <Marach> eBay 2: Monies
[0:15] <CruelNoise> what's TFC?
[0:16] <vurtual> It's like the original team fortress
[0:16] <vurtual> but on goldsrc
[0:16] <vurtual> Originally, Team Fortress was a quake mod and game
[0:16] <vurtual> well, quake mod
[0:16] <CruelNoise> okay..
[0:16] <vurtual> Then, valve bought the guys, quickly threw out TFC
[0:16] <vurtual> and worked on TF2
[0:16] <vurtual> threw out as in made
[0:17] * Dandistine is now known as Dandistine_afk
[0:17] <vurtual> Team Fortress is older than half-life, the original modification being around in 1996
[0:17] <Marach> The Final Conquering?
[0:17] <CruelNoise> why exactly was quake so important to... um.. alot of things?
[0:17] * Chicken_Face (chicken_fa@host86-164-189-237.range86-164.btcentralplus.com) Quit (Quit: awesomeawesomeawesome)
[0:17] <vurtual> because it could be modded
[0:17] <vurtual> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Quake_-_family_tree_2.svg
[0:17] <vurtual> and it was in general well made, easily licensed
[0:18] <Marach> i want to shrink that svg
[0:18] <vurtual> ctrl+mousewheel
[0:18] <vurtual> do do da doooo
[0:18] <bildramer> :l
[0:18] <vurtual> anyways
[0:18] <vurtual> Yeah, anyone could mod quake
[0:18] <bildramer> my mouse wheel is broken
[0:18] <bildramer> :(
[0:19] <vurtual> and that was a pretty amazing thing, especially after doom wads
[0:19] <vurtual> bildramer, numpad keys?
[0:19] <CruelNoise> wow, so valve's engine is actually based on quake?
[0:19] <vurtual> +- normal and numpad?
[0:19] <vurtual> CruelNoise, yup
[0:19] <bildramer> ...
[0:19] <vurtual> quakeworld and a bit from quake2 somehow apparently maybe
[0:19] <bildramer> learned 2 things in a minute
[0:19] <bildramer> wow
[0:19] <vurtual> 2 learned in 2 minutes, excellent
[0:19] <vurtual> Then, this was goldsrc, half-life was made
[0:20] <bildramer> goldsrc?
[0:20] <CruelNoise> did ID open-source the engine, and all this happened?
[0:20] <bildramer> canihaz Source
[0:20] <vurtual> the source was around for a looong time
[0:20] <vurtual> as in, id always did that
[0:20] <vurtual> That was their thing
[0:20] <bildramer> source's source
[0:20] <bildramer> [/lamepun]
[0:20] <vurtual> bildramer extract it
[0:20] <bildramer> how
[0:20] <vurtual> Gearbox did the expansions Blue Shfit(basically a mappack for half-life, with new hands and some implemented content, pretty nice, made way differently than half-life in ways),
[0:20] * DatOneGuy (DatOneGuy@adsl-64-30-235.mia.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[0:20] <bildramer> if*
[0:20] <vurtual> and Opposing Force(added new weapons, enemeis, plot, and felt a lot more modern, had some lame mapping practiceas as usual)
[0:21] * DatOneGuy (DatOneGuy@adsl-64-30-235.mia.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:21] <CruelNoise> i wonder how Id could possibly be bought out...
[0:21] <vurtual> opfor came out like, in the 2000s
[0:21] <CruelNoise> untill i heard it, i thought it was, like impossible.
[0:21] <Marach> ...id is cool.
[0:21] <vurtual> Then, they also went and did more games
[0:21] <vurtual> like nightfire and such
[0:21] <bildramer> so
[0:21] <vurtual> valve did source in half-life 2
[0:21] <Marach> releasing source code for old games = win
[0:21] <bildramer> what's the name of the new decade?
[0:21] <CruelNoise> they were with nightfire?
[0:21] <vurtual> Marach, the source wasn't just "released"
[0:21] <bildramer> we're living in the <___>s
[0:21] <vurtual> because it's old
[0:21] <vurtual> They released it pretty early on
[0:22] <vurtual> infact with the pak0 thing, you could compile quake 3 arena yourself
[0:22] <Marach> isn't that like, even better? :D
[0:22] <bildramer> :l
[0:22] <CruelNoise> okay, okay... so all these games are technically heavily modded quake?
[0:22] <bildramer> lol
[0:22] <CruelNoise> holy shit
[0:22] <vurtual> yes, very heavily modded
[0:22] <vurtual> and modified, upgraded, modernized
[0:22] <vurtual> modern warfare 2 is too
[0:22] <bildramer> ...
[0:22] <Marach> ^
[0:22] <vurtual> Basically it's like discovering evolution
[0:22] <bildramer> lolol
[0:22] <vurtual> all the games descended from one quake
[0:23] <Rooster> an earthquak
[0:23] <Rooster> Earth Quack
[0:23] <vurtual> one quake to rule them all, one quake to find them. One quake to make them all and in the darkness install them.
[0:23] <CruelNoise> woow.
[0:23] <sllide> frikken hel
[0:23] <sllide> hell
[0:23] <sllide> lol
[0:23] <vurtual> I have the q2 and q3 sources on my computer right now, waiting for me to find a q3 disc or q2 disc
[0:23] <CruelNoise> i suddenly love old things even more than i did
[0:23] <vurtual> if I find a q3 disc the first thing I'm doing is modding it, alot.
[0:23] <CruelNoise> can't you get quake on steam?
[0:24] <vurtual> yeah, not the same man.
[0:24] <vurtual> Not the same.
[0:24] <CruelNoise> quake(s)
[0:24] <CruelNoise> not the same..
[0:24] <vurtual> Also I don't want to spend money because of quake live
[0:24] <Furyhunter> you can buy quake and doom on steam and use your own source port
[0:24] <vurtual> popping in a disc/floppy
[0:24] <CruelNoise> i have so much to learn
[0:24] <vurtual> running an oldschool-assembled game just...has so much fun to it
[0:24] <CruelNoise> floppy
[0:24] <Marach> is there anything you can pay for in qlive?
[0:24] <vurtual> Marach, eventually listen servers
[0:24] <vurtual> cheaply
[0:24] <Furyhunter> no
[0:24] <CruelNoise> I WISH I WAS SO MUCH OLDER
[0:24] <Furyhunter> the game is entirely handled by ads
[0:24] <vurtual> the upside: play with friends
[0:24] <vurtual> CruelNoise, these worlds have not died
[0:24] <vurtual> the quake games are still modded
[0:25] <Marach> and played!
[0:25] <vurtual> as in, people, to this day, still do quake mods, and doom mods even.
[0:25] * Adam01 (Adam@cpc1-basl5-0-0-cust446.basl.cable.virginmedia.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:25] <Furyhunter> very big doom mods.
[0:25] <Marach> when i first heard about qlive, i thought it's a joke
[0:25] <vurtual> It's like the only game you could really call a sport.
[0:25] <CruelNoise> yeah, but i've always loved the idea of watching these sorts of things grow.
[0:25] <CruelNoise> i'm a lurker by nature
[0:25] <Marach> i expected " trial expired" any moment
[0:25] <vurtual> CruelNoise, learn C++ enough
[0:25] <vurtual> go make your own quake/doom modification
[0:25] <vurtual> That does everything uniquely
[0:26] <CruelNoise> see previous comment
[0:26] <vurtual> maybe try to splice quake and doom somehow
[0:26] <vurtual> using the graphics from doom, in quake's environments, modified to work with 3d.
[0:26] <vurtual> also licenses back then let you do stuff like, sell a game with the source and be allowed to without even contacting the dev
[0:26] <vurtual> or the funny "if you like this game, send me money" era
[0:26] <vurtual> When commercial games really did that
[0:27] <CruelNoise> so, if i make a mod of quake, i can sell it?
[0:27] <vurtual> I think
[0:27] <CruelNoise> how queer.
[0:27] <vurtual> if you have the source included
[0:27] <vurtual> not sure anymore
[0:27] <vurtual> Oh maybe that was... doom I think
[0:27] <Marach> hmm, can hl2 mods be sold on steam?
[0:27] <vurtual> quakeworld's gpl I think
[0:27] <vurtual> Marach, through valve
[0:27] <CruelNoise> well, if ID open sourced it, if i start with the very original i should have no problems.
[0:27] <vurtual> You know what'd be hillarious? Even funnier if there was never a source leak
[0:28] <vurtual> mod quake into becoming similar to source
[0:28] <vurtual> to the point where it emulates most qualities of it, looks similar to it, and works with all source tools
[0:28] <CruelNoise> ...?
[0:28] <vurtual> supporting .mdl, the compiling tools in the source sdk, and such.
[0:29] <CruelNoise> it makes me cry that i don't understand some of this.
[0:29] <vurtual> CruelNoise, make a quake mod
[0:29] <vurtual> that turns quake into Source
[0:29] <Marach> lol
[0:29] <vurtual> supporting all the features and technology
[0:29] <vurtual> while still being a directly modified quake engine
[0:29] <vurtual> or even better: The other way around, and have it support both
[0:29] <Marach> what physics engine does it use?
[0:29] <vurtual> Source uses havok which would be a problem
[0:30] <vurtual> anyways, that'd be cool, being able to load quake maps over the ages into source.
[0:30] <CruelNoise> vurtual, do you do things like this?
[0:30] <vurtual> sorta
[0:30] <Quatroking> I should ask Notch about the vertical loop idea again
[0:30] <vurtual> It's always funny to combine things
[0:30] <Quatroking> for floating maps
[0:30] <Marach> lol
[0:30] <Quatroking> jump down in the nothing and fall back on the level
[0:31] <vurtual> aperture science handheld minecraft
[0:31] <bildramer> lol
[0:31] <vurtual> aaaaanyways I have ear protection on my knee
[0:31] <vurtual> my knee doesn't have years
[0:31] <vurtual> ears*
[0:31] <bildramer> what
[0:31] <Marach> Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Vurtual?
[0:31] <vurtual> black, green ear things, a big gold R and "Remington" in gold below that
[0:31] <vurtual> padding rings and foam on the inside
[0:32] <bildramer> ...
[0:32] <bildramer> see previous comment
[0:32] <vurtual> your run of the mill don't-go-deaf-from-bullets ear protection

[0:34] <CruelNoise> i've never fought it.
[0:34] <CruelNoise> /sad
[0:35] <vurtual> What the world needs now is another id-inspired internet hero
[0:35] <vurtual> Working then wouldn't change much
[0:35] <vurtual> working now would only bring more fun into this world
[0:35] <bildramer> :o
[0:35] <bildramer> fun
[0:35] <bildramer> D:
[0:35] <vurtual> go compile quake and make your own game, maybe some generic hardcore space marine.
[0:35] <bildramer> get the pitchforks
[0:35] <vurtual> or some generic person who found a weapon
[0:35] <bildramer> no fun zone here
[0:35] * vurtual blasts bildramer with creativity beams
[0:35] <CruelNoise> vurtual, how do i do that?

[0:36] * Furyhunter (Furyhunter@cpe-70-112-108-97.austin.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:37] <vurtual> firstly, get quake 3
[0:37] <vurtual> and the pak0 thing
[0:37] <vurtual> Then, go download the q3 source from id's site
[0:37] <vurtual> then, maybe get gcc, get q3 to compile properly
[0:37] <vurtual> then, start changing it as you see fit.
[0:37] * HyperPyro (PyroPyro@79.101.158.126) has joined #minecraft
[0:37] <CruelNoise> what's pak0, gcc?
[0:37] <vurtual> Get some modelling software you can use for this, make cheap really low res models. Once you get it working right, you can have anything you can possibly imagine.
[0:38] <vurtual> a file in quake 3 that is needed to use the source
[0:38] <vurtual> gcc is gnu compiler collection, a compiler
[0:38] <vurtual> it will turn the raw code into quake for you
[0:38] <bildramer> lol
[0:38] <vurtual> it is a weapon hard to master, but will serve you well.
[0:38] <bildramer> durr
[0:39] <CruelNoise> gnu... isn't that what linux is made from?
[0:39] <bildramer> :|
[0:39] <vurtual> okay
[0:39] <vurtual> here's how I can best help you
[0:39] <vurtual> dual boot ubuntu
[0:39] <CruelNoise> already done
[0:39] <bildramer> my.
[0:39] <vurtual> okay
[0:39] <bildramer> Discuss Minecraft for free cookies
[0:40] <vurtual> linux is not "made from" gnu
[0:40] <vurtual> I don't even know how to explain that
[0:40] <vurtual> also gcc should already be in ubuntu by default

[1:16] <CruelNoise> well, not high-high end
[1:16] <CruelNoise> but above average
[1:16] <Marach> slowriot: wtf
[1:16] <Azathoth> must have been an error with their fps monitoring code. because a negative fps is impossible
[1:17] <Azathoth> it would be like... the game going backwards?

[1:30] <vurtual> Every random tiny thing, in boxes

[1:31] <Vis{ROTR2010}> sure, the world would be better without them

[3:35] <LG_Legacy> Alot of Ban Globally threads have been shot down/closed down
[3:35] <EmpiresBane> i guess it failed
[3:36] <Animator> And the others lead to full-on battles.
[3:36] <LG_Legacy> Though
[3:36] <LG_Legacy> He does lack evidence
[3:36] <LG_Legacy> People will compare it to a griefer list
[3:36] <LG_Legacy> Trolling and flaming will ensue
[3:36] <LG_Legacy> Yadda yadda
[3:36] <mail2345> @animator why not?
[3:37] <Animator> For starters, people might actually believe you.
[3:37] <Animator> Secondly, it's just stupid.
[3:37] <mail2345> oh
[3:37] <mail2345> the still believe part
[3:37] <mail2345> umm
[3:37] <mail2345> if they actually belive it
[3:37] <LG_Legacy> He's right
[3:37] <mail2345> then their server is likly shit
[3:37] <LG_Legacy> Remember that griefer fake list and people believed it?
[3:38] <jayther> yea, wasnt notch's name on there? x]
[3:38] <mail2345> oh
[3:38] <mail2345> but all those people probably have shit servers
[3:38] <vurtual> ban ban globally threads globally
[3:39] <primis> lol
[3:39] <EmpiresBane> i've never been on any list. it's kinda surprising, i was very active at one point
[3:39] <vurtual> I'm not on any lists really
[3:39] <vurtual> cept the userlist
[3:39] <vurtual> also I just snowboarded on a car
[3:39] <rbos> sounds productive
[3:40] <Aeomin> someone should make a topic on how to make a bad server
[3:40] <mail2345> @animator
[3:40] <EmpiresBane> Animator, were you there on the first officialy unofficial forum?
[3:40] <mail2345> how about a "Ban notch globally"
[3:41] <LG_Legacy> I like how someone once suggested to add kaitou to the banned.txt on download. Like that will make a difference.
[3:41] <EmpiresBane> talk about how notch never builds anything and obviously hacks cuz his name is a different color
[3:41] <LG_Legacy> Funfact:
[3:41] <Animator> Empire, no.
[3:41] <LG_Legacy> Someone did think he hacked cause of his name
[3:41] <Animator> I came later on.
[3:41] <LG_Legacy> And banned him
[3:41] <Cial> oh dear god
[3:41] <rbos> nice
[3:41] <Cial> we have some smart people in this game
[3:42] <jayther> yes, very, cial.
[3:42] <jayther> x]
[3:42] <EmpiresBane> can notch get around bans?
[3:42] <CruelNoise> LG! i know that guy IRL
[3:42] <Cial> i would say so EmpiresBane
[3:42] <Animator> Now then, I'm going to talk to the staff about the fate of ban threads. There are some huge pros and cons being considered here.
[3:42] <Iguana> Cruel.
[3:42] <CruelNoise> iguana
[3:42] <Iguana> You know a kaitou irl?
[3:42] <CruelNoise> i know duane
[3:42] <Iguana> DUANE IS KAITOU?!
[3:42] <CruelNoise> also, bring nwn
[3:42] <Iguana> WTF IS DIS.
[3:42] <Cial> KIll Kaitou
[3:42] <Iguana> DO WE HAVE TO KILL HIM?
[3:43] <CruelNoise> duane did that, but...
[3:43] <Cial> YESSSSS
[3:43] <Iguana> Banned Notch?
[3:43] <Iguana> Oh.
[3:43] <Iguana> BUT IF HE WAS KAITOU.
[3:43] <Iguana> I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TO KILL HIM.
[3:43] <Animator> CALM THE BALLS DOWN OR I'LL MUTE THE CHANNEL.

[3:43] <Iguana> Don't do it bro.

[3:44] <vurtual> Today is the start of a new national holiday, Animator week.
[3:44] <CruelNoise> okay
[3:44] <CruelNoise> what do we do on animator week?
[3:44] <Iguana> When is Iguana day then?
[3:44] <CruelNoise> tuesday
[3:44] <vurtual> Anyone caught not observing will be flogged with a whip that makes you unable to speak.
[3:44] <vurtual> but do nothing else
[3:44] <CruelNoise> now, guess what i'm gonna say, iguana.
[3:44] <Iguana> I know.
[3:44] <vurtual> Talking during this will be stressful.
[3:44] <Iguana> The day I bring NWN.
[3:44] <Iguana> Amirite.
[3:44] <Animator> Now then, there's good things and bad things about these ban threads. For starters, these kinds of threads can warn people of major griefers out there (this is how kaitou was revealed).
[3:44] <CruelNoise> sure, if that's wat you want to do
[3:45] <Iguana> No Iguana day then.
[3:45] <CruelNoise> animator, just impliment a report system or something
[3:45] <CruelNoise> iguana, we'll still celebrate you on tuesday
[3:45] <vurtual> Make the default server send all ban states to a server

[3:45] * TrueWolves (DontGiveUp@69-176-226-109.static.izoom.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)

[3:45] <Animator> Um. Cruelnoise.

[3:46] <Animator> We already have a report system.
[3:46] <Animator> >_>
[3:46] <CruelNoise> owait
[3:46] <CruelNoise> they're telling people to ban people on their servers?
[3:46] <CruelNoise> i had it all wrong
[3:46] <Animator> No, they're telling people to tell other people to ban specific people from a server.
[3:47] <Animator> All servers, really.
[3:47] <CruelNoise> i thought they were asking you to ban people on the forums...

[3:47] <vurtual> Could you say, ban "durr*", and ban any name that starts with "durr"?
[3:47] <EmpiresBane> no
[3:48] <vurtual> aww
[3:48] <vurtual> Then people could ban everyone in those lists, by adding a space and * or something.
[3:48] <Aeomin> put "*"
[3:48] <CruelNoise> X
[3:48] <EmpiresBane> ban all xX*Xx
[3:48] <AndrewPH> regex bans would be better

[3:49] <EmpiresBane> regex?

[3:50] <rbos> i.e, m/^xX.*Xx$/ would match any string beginning and ending
[3:50] <rbos> with xx
[3:50] <CruelNoise> i wouldn't use that expression regularily
[3:50] <mail2345> i would
[3:50] <EmpiresBane> that's a lot of typing for something simple
[3:50] <rbos> it's actually really simple once you know it
[3:50] * mail2345 sets mode: +b xX*Xx!*@*
[3:51] <rbos> and you get a lot of bang for the complexity buck
[3:51] <CruelNoise> yeah, but it could be simpler

[5:01] <vurtual> as in like, soem guy with a small flat piece of land and a windsock
[5:01] <CruelNoise> heh
[5:01] <CruelNoise> a closer guess would be...
[5:02] <vurtual> so basically find some place with wayyy too much stuff, really shiny stuff, kinda near-ish to that general area and you'll find me.

[5:04] <vurtual> CruelNoise, if you do find it
[5:04] <vurtual> you will immediately recognize it
[5:04] <vurtual> shiny, expensive things
[5:05] <CruelNoise> that's kinda hard to see from google maps
[5:05] <vurtual> not really

[5:08] <Cial> "twister"

[5:08] <vurtual> just it has less giant building
[5:09] <CruelNoise> are you north, south, east or west of the airport?
[5:09] <vurtual> I have to be southeast
[5:09] <vurtual> since it's yknow, on the border

[5:14] <vurtual> WEAPONS WEAPONS WEAPONS WEAPONS WEAPONS
[5:14] <Chezhead> But dead zombies could flow in
[5:14] <Chezhead> So what location do you think would be most protected in the continental USA against a zombie outbreak?

[5:14] <vurtual> happens there

[5:15] <Chezhead> Washington DC? The pres. lives there, lots of support/
[5:15] <vurtual> rock island arsenal is on the mississippi you know
[5:15] <vurtual> DC is one of the worst places to be
[5:15] <Chezhead> Hm...
[5:15] <vurtual> populated, run down
[5:15] <vurtual> violent
[5:15] <Chezhead> Yeah, bad taxes and stuff
[5:15] <EmpiresBane> vurtual, are there any epic scars left in the earth from tornaoes?
[5:15] <vurtual> You, EmpiresBane.
[5:15] <EmpiresBane> i'm a scar?
[5:15] <Chezhead> But if the pres. needs protections, a lot of military would eb at washington DC and all
[5:15] <vurtual> yup
[5:15] <vurtual> Chezhead, a few guards
[5:15] <vurtual> and that's it
[5:15] <EmpiresBane> that's tight!
[5:16] <vurtual> as in, just his white house stuff
[5:16] <vurtual> Nobody's dumb enough to try to attack the president
[5:16] <vurtual> they'd just get their homeland nuked
[5:16] <vurtual> or, if American, insulted into nonexistance
[5:16] <EmpiresBane> course, those guards are highly trained most of the tine
[5:16] <Chezhead> What about the Alquida or whatever?
[5:16] <vurtual> jsut a few vs zombies
[5:16] <Chezhead> They have no real hometown
[5:16] <vurtual> no seriously rock island arsenal
[5:16] <vurtual> technically an island
[5:16] <EmpiresBane> as in, almost as good as NYPD special forces
[5:16] <vurtual> Massive amount of defense
[5:17] <vurtual> no end to many awesmoe weapons
[5:17] <vurtual> major river
[5:17] <EmpiresBane> LA should be a trainig ground
[5:17] <EmpiresBane> *training
[5:17] * EmpiresBane is now known as EmpiresBane|chores
[5:18] <Chezhead> Alquida could just release nerotoxins in a presedental speach thing and no one could nuke them, they would rather die than be captured
[5:18] <Chezhead> So Alcida, Alquida, IDK could easally kill him
[5:18] <vurtual> we can cure most bioweapons that exist
[5:18] <Chezhead> It's a matter of time, and in this case, I don't like time
[5:18] <vurtual> ..
[5:18] <Chezhead> Not all
[5:18] <vurtual> only just realised what you said
[5:18] <Chezhead> And how would he know? By the time it kicked in, he could be dead?
[5:18] <CruelNoise> do you live somewhere near swan lake road?
[5:19] <vurtual> Al-Qaeda
[5:19] <EmpiresBane|chores> if they really wanted to, they could just snipe hime
[5:19] <vurtual> also we sorta nuked them
[5:19] <vurtual> EmpiresBane|chores, people try
[5:19] <vurtual> like, all the time
[5:19] <vurtual> we shoot them
[5:19] <Chezhead> Yeah
[5:19] <LuciferZ> We shoot them in faces
[5:19] <Chezhead> We can't nuke them, they live in a HUGE range of mountains
[5:19] <vurtual> you miss, they have sensors to tell where the bullet is
[5:19] <LuciferZ> With wepon
[5:19] <vurtual> they can even detect scope glint
[5:19] <vurtual> or the glint of your retinas
[5:19] <Chezhead> They don't care if they are killed, they want to kill everything in whatever case
[5:19] <vurtual> Chezhead, we sorta did
[5:19] <vurtual> figurativel
[5:19] <CruelNoise> do you live near a bridge?
[5:20] <vurtual> no CruelNoise, inland
[5:20] <vurtual> not caring about being dead doesn't really make them immune to being dead
[5:20] <CruelNoise> i thought you said you lived right on the mississipi
[5:20] <vurtual> no, near.
[5:20] <CruelNoise> mississippi
[5:20] <Chezhead> Nukes arn't actually too powerful, if you live upwind from the 4 mile blast radius, you are safe
[5:20] <vurtual> the airport is on it
[5:20] <vurtual> hiroshima had what... 8 miles?
[5:20] <Chezhead> Hydrogyn bombs are different

[5:25] <vurtual> I spent AGES
[5:25] <vurtual> Getting a boat rigged to a chopper
[5:25] <LuciferZ> Everyone is screwed
[5:25] <vurtual> then lifting the boat to a specific location
[5:25] <vurtual> then found out I cannot push the boat
[5:26] <LuciferZ> If the US gets hit by a hydrogen bomb, pretty much everyone is going to get the counterattack
[5:26] <vurtual> yeah IF
[5:26] <vurtual> We can shoot them down
[5:26] <LuciferZ> Yep.
[5:26] <LuciferZ> With lasers too!
[5:26] <vurtual> anything really
[5:26] <vurtual> puppies

[5:55] <ClassiestMedic> yeah?
[5:55] <vurtual> they can allow you to move at walk speed
[5:55] <jhoijhoi> Do any of you host your own servers?

[5:55] <vurtual> but can slide down slopey terrain
[5:55] <jhoijhoi> And if so, can you view the daily chat log thing?
[5:55] <vurtual> I do
[5:55] <vurtual> ...chat log thing
[5:55] <Dysgalt> My new skin confuses me
[5:55] <jhoijhoi> lol me too, I was just wondering if you can read the chat log

[5:56] <vede> O_o

[6:25] * Cial wants a wants a 2.5 block high character so it would be 6 ft tall
[6:26] <Superwafflez> we're 2m tall already D=
[6:26] <EmpiresBane> oh my god.... the suggestions and support forums are breeding ground of stupidity
[6:26] <EmpiresBane> which means taller than 6'
[6:26] <billyman> I know they would be terrible
[6:26] <rbos> 6 foot is around 170cm i think
[6:26] <billyman> Maybe restricted to a gamemode
[6:26] <billyman> they could work well
[6:26] <rbos> 182cm
[6:26] <Superwafflez> 6 feet = 1.8288 meters
[6:26] <EmpiresBane> no. they couldn't for too many reasons to list
[6:27] <billyman> Meh
[6:27] <EmpiresBane> like memory
[6:27] <billyman> Sounded better awhile back
[6:27] * Bomb_Spammer is now known as Bomb_Spammer|shower
[6:27] <Brett> our toon is a freak of nature
[6:27] <billyman> yeah
[6:27] <Superwafflez> 2 meters = 6.56167979 feet
[6:27] <Superwafflez> D=
[6:27] <Brett> aside from being 2m tall he's about 0.5 m wide
[6:27] <Cial> oh well you have to understand i dont know the metric system well at all
[6:27] <Brett> psh
[6:27] <rbos> well, it's easy to learn
[6:27] <Brett> silly imperialists
[6:28] <Superwafflez> Metric is simple.
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> cial, that's sad
[6:28] <Brett> easier than the imperial system was... although that might be because imperial was my 2nd
[6:28] <Superwafflez> Imperial is just screwed up.
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> imperial is nice
[6:28] <Superwafflez> 12's and 6's... ergh
[6:28] <Cial> my high school sucked ass
[6:28] <rbos> the US uses a *lot* of metric measurements
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> once you know it
[6:28] <Chezhead> Metric is awesome
[6:28] <Chezhead> Stupid imperial junk
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> cial...
[6:28] <Wedge> a gelatinous cube would be 3x3x3 blocks in minecraft
[6:28] <EmpiresBane> i learned it in elementary
[6:28] <Cial> EmpiresBane?
[6:29] <Brett> aren't we getting jellies as an enemy?
[6:29] <EmpiresBane> metric
[6:29] <Wedge> according to twitter yes
[6:29] <Cial> well like i said my school sucked and they never made us use it so i forgot it

[6:30] <vurtual> "imperial" is useful
[6:30] <EmpiresBane> i never use it. i still remember basics
[6:30] <vurtual> The units aer actually applicable
[6:31] <vurtual> games make me use km :(
[6:31] <Brett> what?
[6:31] <EmpiresBane> like 1 meter is 39 inches, am i correct?
[6:31] <Brett> unstandardized naming
[6:31] <Brett> arbitrary unit sizes
[6:31] <Brett> yep, applicable :D
[6:31] <rbos> I think a foot is 30.mumble centimeters
[6:31] <rbos> like 30.5 or something
[6:31] <Cial> i can convert temperature from F to C and thats about it
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> that i can't rememeber well
[6:32] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[6:32] <Superwafflez> C is great
[6:32] <rbos> I try not to convert between metric and imperial, it's simpler just to think in one or the other
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> its like C=F(5/3)+10?
[6:32] <rbos> that said, I'm stuck with pounds/feet for height/weight
[6:32] <EmpiresBane> or are the f and c switched?
[6:33] <Brett> point in case: 0 is placed at a universally accepted zero: the freezing point of earth-bound, unsalinated water
[6:33] <Superwafflez> cant argue with that
[6:33] <EmpiresBane> ah... but it allows for much more differentation for the common man

[6:34] <vurtual> Brett, how tall are you?
[6:34] <Legolord> I think I should join a clan.
[6:34] <EmpiresBane> the difference between 10 C and 20 C is different than 10 and 20 F

[6:35] <vurtual> most peoplea re around 6 feet
[6:36] <vurtual> 5 feet=really short

[6:37] <EmpiresBane> your system is off
[6:37] <Azathoth> i'm 5'8" and i'd consider myself to be short :P
[6:37] <Superwafflez> Looks like I'm 6' and... 1/2 an inch...

[6:46] <EmpiresBane> Azathoth, java isn't as strong as other languages if those other languages are done right
[6:46] <Azathoth> strong?
[6:46] <EmpiresBane> although it is easy to mess them up
[6:46] <EmpiresBane> fast
[6:47] <rbos> sounds like we got ourselves a real expert coder

[6:47] * TD|Blah is now known as TestDUmmy
[6:47] <mail2345> HEY GUYS
[6:47] <Azathoth> java is powerful and easy to use
[6:47] <EmpiresBane> you've got yourself a coder that knows basicd
[6:47] <mail2345> I CAN PORT JAVA TO C++
[6:47] <mail2345> IN 3 DAYS
[6:47] <EmpiresBane> *basics
[6:47] <Azathoth> it isn't as fast as c++, but as it is, i'd say it's fast enough for minecraft
[6:47] <EmpiresBane> java is powerful, but others can be faster
[6:47] <rbos> java has advantages unrelated to speed
[6:48] <rbos> different languages are designed for different purposes: film at eleven
[6:48] <EmpiresBane> course it takes a lot of management to get better performance
[6:48] <EmpiresBane> i'm not saying java sucks
[6:48] <Superwafflez> It's just slow.
[6:48] <Brett> uh
[6:48] <Brett> azathoth
[6:49] <Brett> in some situational cases java is faster
[6:49] <Brett> jvm hotspot <3
[6:49] <EmpiresBane> what will speed up minecraft will a standalone client
[6:49] <Brett> a better pc will
[6:49] <Brett> fo sho
[6:49] <EmpiresBane> *be
[6:49] <Azathoth> i'm not familiar with what that is, but in general it's slower because it runs on a virtual machine
[6:49] <Brett> well, yeah, that's true
[6:50] <rbos> it's too bad hardware java bytecode interpreters never caught on
[6:50] <EmpiresBane> what's intereating is bluray players use java
[6:50] <Azathoth> that would be kinda nifty
[6:50] <outsomnia> .___.
[6:51] <Brett> but in some cases the hotspot component of the jvm enables the jvm to optimize for frequently executed areas of code

[8:33] <LuciferZ> Well, if you're trying to save to one of the five online slots, it won't work. Those slots are for creative/survival
[8:33] <LuciferZ> In order to save indev, you need to use the 'Save File' option
[8:33] <TerryRollings> Oh, I see
[8:34] <TerryRollings> Will that keep any items and such? Objects stored in chests and the like?

[8:34] <LuciferZ> Yes, it will
[8:34] <TerryRollings> Awesome. Thanks LiciferZ.
[8:34] <LuciferZ> Probably does in infdev too, but I haven't tested that much. Definitely works in indev
[8:35] <LuciferZ> No problem.
[8:35] <TerryRollings> One more question
[8:36] <TerryRollings> This whole Hacking issue, I've gathered it's frowned upon by some parts of the community, but others embrace the concept for creative mode.
[8:37] <LuciferZ> I love hacks in creative, personally.
[8:37] <TerryRollings> What is the 'official' stance on the custom client wrappers?
[8:37] <rbos> TerryRollings: if you use a map editor on the save files, it'll destroy any inventory or chest items
[8:37] <rbos> </fyi>
[8:37] <LuciferZ> Oh yeah, that's true.
[8:37] <TerryRollings> Oh, thanks for the heads up, rbos
[8:38] <LuciferZ> The official stance, as in Notch's view, is 'No'
[8:38] <LuciferZ> But really it's up to the server owner
[8:38] <TerryRollings> I see...
[8:39] <LuciferZ> The most common wrapper can be blocked at will by the server admin by putting -hax in their server's MOTD. Other clients will ignore that, unfortunately.
[8:40] <LuciferZ> We're actually not supposed to talk about them in this channel but meh. I think it's silly to ignore what is obviously there.
[8:40] <TerryRollings> Well, I enjoy the WOM community and it's public creative servers, I dont see any reason why measures should be implemented to stop the moddings...
[8:40] <TerryRollings> Oh, sorry, I didnt realise.
[8:41] <Varriount_> The main reason is that it takes away creative control of the game from notch
[8:41] <LuciferZ> Yeah, there are arguments for and against them. It makes griefing a lot easier is the big counter-hacks point.
[8:41] <Varriount_> But it also makes OP'ing a server easier too
[8:42] <TerryRollings> Lucifer; Agreed, griefers do suck, but the main WOM servers have come up with very effective counter measures against griefers.
[8:42] <AndrewPH> Not just WoM bro
[8:42] <AndrewPH> Lots of servers have antigrief
[8:42] <LuciferZ> Exactly. But those measures are private, so many servers don't get the protection.
[8:42] <TerryRollings> Aye, tricky...
[8:42] <Varriount_> Although, if you want to talk about custom servers in general, go to #CCoalition
[8:43] <AndrewPH> While the /undo types of commands are only in privately distributed servers atm, I have a feeling they'll start blooming soon.
[8:43] <Varriount_> I use minercpp, it's one of the most common custom server
[8:43] <Varriount_> What do you mean by /undo?
[8:43] <AndrewPH> It's also dead and sucks
[8:43] <Varriount_> Hey!
[8:43] <AndrewPH> What?
[8:43] <AndrewPH> I'm only saying it like it is
[8:43] <LuciferZ> MinerCPP is better than fucking MCSharp though
[8:44] <LuciferZ> I hate that software so much, lol.
[8:44] <Varriount_> The "and sucks" is opinion
[8:44] <AndrewPH> What ISN'T better than mcsharp?
[8:44] <LuciferZ> Admincraft?
[8:44] <AndrewPH> that's not a server
[8:44] <LuciferZ> It's some sort of addon thing
[8:44] <AndrewPH> It's a wrapper for the official server
[8:44] <AndrewPH> :1
[8:45] <TerryRollings> I understand why the Dev might be bothered that creative control might slip from his grasps, but still...
[8:45] <LuciferZ> Well you asked "What isn't better than MCSharp?" not "What server isn't better than MCSharp"
[8:45] <LuciferZ> I could have said getting skullfucked isn't better.

[8:57] <vurtual> I should totally learn to model and make a shooter game
[8:57] <vurtual> give it things like sound and fun and then have it be like, some minorly-actiony shooter with really rigid and useful physics.
[8:57] <bildramer> :l
[8:57] <vurtual> so if you like, jump on a speeding train, you will stay on it(granted that it doesn't throw you off)
[8:58] <bildramer> morning.
[8:58] <LuciferZ> give it things like sound and 'fun'?
[8:58] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[8:58] <vurtual> then people will have knife fights ontop of trains, or ride in the backs of supply trucks
[8:58] <ClassiestMedic> Win
[8:59] <vurtual> If, maybe if, I could get some flashier physics, I could pull off stuff like rocketing a truck so that it blows around, and people are thrown about.
[8:59] <LuciferZ> I want to play a game where there's no coherent plot, control scheme, or even genre
[8:59] <LuciferZ> It's just an interactive montage of the most ridiculously cool things they could fit in
[8:59] <AndrewPH> JC2?
[8:59] <vurtual> AndrewPH like if halway through a gunfight
[8:59] <LuciferZ> Does JC2 have pirates?
[8:59] <vurtual> you ended up turning into tetris
[9:00] <AndrewPH> vurtual, sometimes you do
[9:00] <vurtual> and you clear lines to do actions

[9:00] <LuciferZ> Hmmm
[9:01] <vurtual> does there big explosion on the ship?
[9:01] <LuciferZ> Does it have giant eagles?

[9:01] <vurtual> so you fire exploding airships?
[9:01] <vurtual> No wait, is the end boss missile thing a possible model for things?>
[9:02] <AndrewPH> you don't fire anything
[9:02] <AndrewPH> you throw the triggered explosive
[9:02] <AndrewPH> and when it detonates you get a big boom
[9:02] <vurtual> I mean for like, bullets and rockets
[9:02] <vurtual> like how you could change bullets into a rocket model, give them a rocket impact, and add a damage radius.
[9:03] <AndrewPH> idk
[9:03] <vurtual> to make anything fire awesome rockets. Pistols, assault rifles, sniper rifles, miniguns.

[9:04] <vurtual> MOST REWARDING VICTORY SCREEN EVER SOMEHOW
[9:04] <bildramer> lol
[9:04] <bildramer> just make it insanely hard
[9:04] <vurtual> in rainbow six I had an amazing amount of joy and feeling of victory every time I saw a mission complete screen
[9:05] <bildramer> so IWBTG is a toddler's game in relation to it
[9:05] <vurtual> maybe because I failed alot.
[9:05] <bildramer> then we can talk
[9:05] <vurtual> and it was one of the few game sI cuold actually progress in
[9:05] <vurtual> and it was pretty hard since you had to plan an assault yourself
[9:05] <vurtual> so every time I finished I would just be like "woo!" and then feel like I accomplished something
[9:06] <Azathoth> rainbow sex
[9:06] <vurtual> Rescuing random people suddenly becomes like saving lives
[9:06] <vurtual> that game rocked

[9:06] <vurtual> rainbow :sax:
[9:06] <Azathoth> when a game is that hard, you don't need a flashy cinematics as a reward for beating a level. the fact that you actually did it is it's own reward
[9:07] <LuciferZ> Kay wait when you say rainbow sex
[9:07] <LuciferZ> Do you mean sex on a rainbow, or rainbows fucking each other?
[9:08] <bildramer> ...
[9:08] <Azathoth> i was thinking more like gay sex
[9:08] <bildramer> fucking rainbows
[9:08] <LuciferZ> Oh.
[9:08] <Azathoth> cause rainbows are a symbol of fags

[9:15] <Dysgalt> she could of just gotten a rock
[9:15] <Dysgalt> for a ipad
[9:15] <Dysgalt> same damn things
[9:15] <Azathoth> iPads are a complete waste of money
[9:15] <Dysgalt> except the ipad uses batteries
[9:16] <Azathoth> except there's this little marble rolling game called labyrinth 2 i think that's really addicting
[9:16] <Azathoth> but besides that, it's a paperweight
[9:16] <LuciferZ> 32 GB is an embarrassment
[9:16] <Dysgalt> my phone has half that :v and its like 1/15 the size
[9:16] <LuciferZ> It's not like hard drives take up space
[9:16] <Dysgalt> or solid state
[9:16] <LuciferZ> My laptop fits 250 GB in one corner, right under my hand
[9:17] <Dysgalt> I have a 64gb flash drive
[9:17] <Aeomin> cost more..
[9:17] <Dysgalt> thats like 3 quaters long
[9:17] <LuciferZ> So if I put pressure on it it beeps at me
[9:17] <Azathoth> the ipad is impressive with its thinness and the awesome touch screen, but it's really kinda useless
[9:17] <Dysgalt> and a quarter high
[9:17] <bildramer> hm...
[9:17] <LuciferZ> It doesn't even have fucking headphone jacks
[9:17] <bildramer> you could carve the screen out and use it as a picture frame
[9:17] <Dysgalt> wtf
[9:17] <Azathoth> it doesn't?
[9:17] <LuciferZ> Nope
[9:17] <Dysgalt> Azathoth ever heard of oled?
[9:17] <bildramer> iPads are indeed useful
[9:17] <LuciferZ> No USB either
[9:17] <bildramer> lololol
[9:17] <Azathoth> yes
[9:18] <bildramer> what about frisbee?
[9:18] <LuciferZ> Don't think it has SD slots
[9:18] <Azathoth> lol. you can use your iPad as a digital picture frame
[9:18] <Azathoth> :P
[9:18] <bildramer> no
[9:18] <bildramer> not digital
[9:18] <LuciferZ> Oh, and! The new Flash! CS5 or whatever
[9:18] <bildramer> >_>
[9:18] <LuciferZ> It was going to be able to save as iPhone apps
[9:18] <Azathoth> also, the iPad is a bitch to type on
[9:19] <LuciferZ> But Apple just banned 3rd party software for creating apps
[9:19] <Dysgalt> My sister said the ipad was the greastest technological revolution ever
[9:19] <bildramer> hahahaha
[9:19] <bildramer> what
[9:19] <Dysgalt> I was "wut"

[9:22] <LuciferZ> So long as it supports pen and touch I'll be happy
[9:22] <Dysgalt> it does
[9:22] <Azathoth> oh yeah
[9:22] <LuciferZ> Good
[9:22] <Azathoth> the iPad doesn't even have a stylus :|
[9:22] <LuciferZ> Of course not
[9:22] <Azathoth> so it's like completely useless for doing anything
[9:22] <Dysgalt> Mad TV should sue apple
[9:22] <Dysgalt> for lols
[9:22] <Dysgalt> over the ipad
[9:23] <LuciferZ> Having a stylus implies it can do anything useful enough as to require precision
[9:23] <Malikat> the stylus should be called the iPon
[9:23] <LuciferZ> But since all it does is dumb shit, you might as well mash your sausage like fingers all over it
[9:23] <Malikat> the iPon absorbs the majority of the blood
[9:23] <Malikat> the iPad is just there to catch any leakage

[9:58] <vede> 'predatory' definitions were mixed in with the 'greedy' definitions.
[9:58] <vede> So I think we can agree it can be either.

[10:08] <Cial> oh hey my download is half done
[10:08] <KodaichiZero> the next update should be pretty good.
[10:09] <KodaichiZero> I hope notch keeps up to his usual work pace, if so then something epic will be in the next update
[10:10] <KodaichiZero> but it's probably just going to be a lighting fix and a really buggy monster spawning system or something
[10:10] <Dysgalt> he said it was fine
[10:10] <Dysgalt> the only thing that was wrong was the lighting code
[10:10] <Dysgalt> from what the last blog post said
[10:11] <Dysgalt> it was all broken
[10:11] <KodaichiZero> yeah
[10:11] <Malikat> fff yes
[10:11] <Dysgalt> that probably means he is rewriting it
[10:11] <KodaichiZero> but he hasn't got monster spawning at all yet
[10:11] <vede> People need to figure out the goddamn standard and use it.
[10:11] <Dysgalt> the post said it was there
[10:11] <vede> Mb = megabits MB = megabytes
[10:12] <vede> b=bit B=byte
[10:12] <AndrewPH> vede, I just said that stop raging.
[10:12] <KodaichiZero> you can spawn monsters with a bow, yeah, but currently we don't have access to a bow

[10:12] <mail2345> fail
[10:12] <mail2345> ever
[10:12] <mail2345> okay so my computer is in the lower shevle of my desk
[10:12] <Dysgalt> thats what you are :v
[10:12] <mail2345> now
[10:12] <mail2345> the power button is facing the wall
[10:12] <vede> AndrewPH, then you went and said "mb" which stands for nothing.
[10:12] <mail2345> my legs pushed the computer in
[10:12] <mail2345> which pushed the power button
[10:13] <AndrewPH> vede, I don't give a shit
[10:13] <vede> D:< RAEGRAEGRAEG
[10:13] <AndrewPH> mb = Mb
[10:13] <KodaichiZero> that sucks
[10:13] <AndrewPH> mb = easier to distinguish from MB
[10:13] * Dysgalt is now known as dys\sleep
[10:13] <vede> When I see "mb" I think "does that person want to say "megabit" or are they just neglecting to capitalize the megabyte symbol?"
[10:14] <vede> Ambiguity ftl.
[10:14] <KodaichiZero> vede you're so picky. most people don't give a damn. if you see someone type mb, just assume they're too lazy or dumb to press the shift key.
[10:14] <Cial> lazy in my case
[10:14] <vede> KodaichiZero, you realize there's a difference between megabytes and megabits, yeah?
[10:15] <KodaichiZero> because in reality, most people are.
[10:15] <KodaichiZero> bit is 8 bytes
[10:15] <KodaichiZero> OTHER WAY AROUND I MEAN
[10:15] <vede> It's really important that people know which one you're talking about, otherwise confusion happens.

[10:16] <KodaichiZero> megabyte = 1000 kilobytes, or 1024? who knows?
[10:16] <vede> KodaichiZero, it's 1000.
[10:16] <KodaichiZero> yeah you know what, vede is right
[10:16] <vede> Mebibytes are 1024. ;)
[10:17] <vede> (That's "MiB")
[10:17] <Malikat> erm
[10:17] <Malikat> actually
[10:18] <AndrewPH> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGyKmvQesgs
[10:18] <AndrewPH> aaaa
[10:18] <AndrewPH> help
[10:18] <AndrewPH> over 9000 penises
[10:18] <Malikat> huh
[10:18] <KodaichiZero> except when you go out and buy a 1 TB hard drive, there's no way you're actually getting 2^40 bytes of data
[10:18] <Malikat> i thought ... what
[10:18] <Malikat> that's so weird
[10:19] <KodaichiZero> commercial products rip people off like that
[10:19] <vede> KodaichiZero, that's because they label stuff with the 1000 system.
[10:19] <vede> Er. multiples-of-ten system.
[10:19] <KodaichiZero> exactly
[10:19] <vede> But your computer will usually measure it with powers of two.
[10:19] <KodaichiZero> and they dont tell you that so it's another ambiguity problem
[10:20] <vede> Indeed.
[10:21] <Malikat> i thought megabyte was the dominant, 1024 term
[10:21] <Malikat> when did it change? D:
[10:22] <KodaichiZero> If I go out and buy a 2GB usb drive and I find out it's actually 1000 megabits, someone's gonna get hurt
[10:22] <vede> Malikat, Around 2000-ish.
[10:23] <vede> There was a big problem with ambiguity so a standard was made stating that "mebi, kibi, etc." would be powers of two and "mega, kilo, etc." would be powers of ten.
[10:24] <Malikat> >`:
[10:24] <Malikat> it was part of the 9/11 conspiracy

[10:34] <vede> Like computing industry
[10:35] <Drewseph> hey guys
[10:35] <Drewseph> do yuo know if Notch plans a score system?
[10:35] <Drewseph> every time you mine a block you get points
[10:35] <Drewseph> and the better the material the better the point earned?
[10:35] <yoshibot> that's a terrible idea
[10:35] * vurtual gets out some dirt
[10:35] * vurtual spams place and dig
[10:35] <Cial> no clue
[10:35] <Drewseph> then WTF is the score for?
[10:35] <yoshibot> killing mobs
[10:36] <vede> Drewseph, no idea, but if he goes through with that scripting stuff he's talked about, it'll almost definitely be possible.
[10:36] <vurtual> 9999
[10:36] <vede> Drewseph, the score comes from the Survival demo.
[10:36] <Drewseph> I'd love to get points for rare materials
[10:36] <vede> It just wasn't ever removed or anything.
[10:36] <Drewseph> like gold and diamond
[10:36] <Drewseph> there should be emeralds too
[10:36] <yoshibot> shouldn't the rare materials be enough?
[10:36] <vede> I like having an arbitrary 'score' value in games.
[10:36] <yoshibot> although i will admit gold is practically USELESS
[10:36] <Drewseph> me too
[10:36] <Drewseph> gives me something to shoot for
[10:37] <vede> I get kind of sad inside when a game doesn't give me some meaningless number to mindlessly increase.
[10:37] <Drewseph> lol
[10:37] <Drewseph> then again a flaw would be placing a block and then breaking it again
[10:37] * AFK|Dae is now known as ZzZ|Dae
[10:37] <Drewseph> do you get points....
[10:37] <vurtual> me too
[10:37] <Drewseph> maybe a score system based on that is bad
[10:37] <vede> Drewseph, place block, lose points?
[10:37] <Drewseph> hmmm
[10:37] <vurtual> hoarding sim
[10:37] <Drewseph> Lose points of that value
[10:37] <Drewseph> ...
[10:37] <Drewseph> VERY NICE
[10:37] <vurtual> half-life 2 had no mindless number, I was sad
[10:38] <vurtual> Just Cause 2 had the chaos bar, then completion %
[10:38] <vede> I mean, I love when a game shouts in my face: HIGH FUCKIN' SCORE MAN WAY2GO
[10:38] <darkedone02> just cause 2 storyline is too short.
[10:38] <vede> And I'm all like FUCK YEAH I GOT TEN MORE POINTS THAN THAT "ABG" PERSON
[10:38] <darkedone02> grinding on chaos and doing missions get a bit too boring

[12:51] <Azathoth> lol
[12:51] <Azathoth> yeah... $400 a day isn't bad at all
[12:52] <Azathoth> 2 days would cover my rent for a month... 11 days would cover tuition for a semester...
[12:52] <Azathoth> damn, i really need to make a successful independent game
[12:54] <Superwafflez> Server costs on top of that
[12:55] <Speljohan_> servers are cheap
[12:55] <Azathoth> that can't be too much
[12:55] <Superwafflez> Depends what country
[12:55] <Speljohan_> not at all
[12:55] <Azathoth> but he will need pretty high bandwidth
[12:55] <Speljohan_> nope Superwafflez
[12:55] <Azathoth> still, not more than a hundred
[12:55] <Speljohan_> because you generally rent servers internationally
[12:55] <Speljohan_> not like you lock yourself into your current country
[12:55] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:55] <Superwafflez> Depends what your market is
[12:56] <Azathoth> i bet minecraft has a larger US audience than swedish :P
[12:56] <Speljohan_> seems pretty pointless, because to the end user there's no real difference
[12:56] <Superwafflez> Most likely
[12:56] <Speljohan_> except minimal ping differences perhaps
[12:56] <Seepia> blame 4chon
[12:56] <Superwafflez> lol 4chon
[12:56] <Superwafflez> asian 4chan
[12:56] <Azathoth> i blame 4chan for all the world's problems
[12:56] <Speljohan_> the last website i had was on a german dedi
[12:56] <Speljohan_> about 300k unique visitors a month, costed $100/month to keep it up
[12:56] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:57] <Speljohan_> and i made about $1.5k/month in profits
[12:57] <Azathoth> nice
[12:57] <Speljohan_> from advertisement
[12:57] <Speljohan_> so it was a good gain
[12:57] <Speljohan_> :P
[12:57] <Azathoth> when i ran my website, i had like 100 visitors a month
[12:57] <Superwafflez> europe and it's cheap bandwidth lol
[12:57] <Azathoth> and made a couple cents off advertising :\
[12:57] <Speljohan_> yeah, but i had a target market Azathoth :P
[12:57] <Azathoth> what was it?
[12:57] <Speljohan_> i had something a lot of *cough* people wanted
[12:57] <Speljohan_> s/people/kids
[12:57] <Azathoth> PR0NZ?!
[12:57] <Azathoth> wait
[12:57] <Speljohan_> a runescape bot
[12:57] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:57] <Azathoth> oh
[12:58] <Superwafflez> Ahah
[12:58] <Azathoth> xD
[12:58] <Superwafflez> Depending on your locale that would be illegal =D
[12:58] <Speljohan_> of coursew
[12:58] <Speljohan_> it was illegal
[12:58] <Speljohan_> luckily i quit
[12:58] <Speljohan_> because the guy who took over recently got sued
[12:58] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:58] <Superwafflez> Bahaha
[12:58] <Speljohan_> mostly because he went mad
[12:58] <Azathoth> but children are so sexy
[12:59] <Speljohan_> and shoved up 14 goldfarm ads
[12:59] <Speljohan_> jagex did not like
[12:59] <Azathoth> or are we talking about runescape bots?
[12:59] <Speljohan_> :D
[12:59] <Speljohan_> ye
[12:59] <Azathoth> oh >_> disregard that
[12:59] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:59] <Speljohan_> oh well, it was a good run
[12:59] * Superwafflez sends Azathoth on his merry way with a sack full of CP.
[12:59] <Superwafflez> =D
[12:59] <Speljohan_> since i live at home with no expenses the cash lasted
[12:59] <Azathoth> :D
[12:59] <Speljohan_> :D
[12:59] * Azathoth disappears into his white van
[12:59] <Speljohan_> made a total of about $14k cash
[13:00] <Speljohan_> wasted it all in a year
[13:00] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:00] <Azathoth> :D
[13:00] * Superwafflez notices it says "Free Candy" on the side of the van...
[13:00] <Speljohan_> new pc, concerts, etc
[13:00] <Speljohan_> most of it went on drinking though
[13:00] <Superwafflez> Hah
[13:00] <Superwafflez> buy a car?
[13:00] <Speljohan_> i cant remember like half my previous summer
[13:00] <Azathoth> drinking is a waste of time and money
[13:00] <Speljohan_> seriously
[13:00] <Speljohan_> i like wasting time/money Azathoth :D
[13:00] <Superwafflez> I need 2.5k lol. =/
[13:00] <Azathoth> i don't D:
[13:00] <MercilessTD> take up an expensive hobby
[13:01] <Speljohan_> Superwafflez, a car is useless to me
[13:01] <Superwafflez> Smoking =D
[13:01] <Speljohan_> gas price is too high
[13:01] <Speljohan_> i wouldn't bother
[13:01] <Superwafflez> ah true
[13:01] <MercilessTD> i was going to say photography equipment collecting
[13:01] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:01] <Speljohan_> i spent it wisely
[13:01] <Speljohan_> i did expand on a hobby
[13:01] <Azathoth> every time i get drunk i end up trying to program or do something productive because i feel like i'm wasting time. it doesn't work out well :|
[13:01] <Speljohan_> bought new stereo
[13:01] <Speljohan_> and aprox 600 new albums
[13:01] <Speljohan_> a few cd's, mostly vinyls tho
[13:02] <MercilessTD> everyone has their hobbies
[13:02] <MercilessTD> man i know what i'd do
[13:02] <MercilessTD> i'd buy a really nice medium format camera
[13:02] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:02] <Superwafflez> How much is gas in sweden anywho?
[13:02] <Azathoth> free
[13:03] <Speljohan_> expensive as shit Superwafflez
[13:03] <Azathoth> (jk)
[13:03] <Superwafflez> hah
[13:03] <Speljohan_> americans complain about gas prices
[13:03] <Speljohan_> and theirs is fucking low
[13:03] <Azathoth> at least your health care is free
[13:03] <Azathoth> i think i'm dieing, but i can't afford to go to a doctor :|
[13:03] <Superwafflez> In Australia it's about $1.30/L at the moment...
[13:03] <Speljohan_> $1.5 per litre pretty much
[13:03] <Azathoth> i'd rather be alive than have cheaper gas
[13:03] <Speljohan_> yeah true Azathoth

[13:23] <Azathoth> troll
[13:23] <Speljohan_> some pub, third night of drinking marathon
[13:23] <Speljohan_> !
[13:23] <Speljohan_> about to pass out

[13:24] <Azathoth> thanks
[13:24] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:24] <Siiseli> np
[13:24] <Siiseli> he wasn't even a creative troll :/
[13:24] <Azathoth> he probably wasn't gonna come back anyway, but whatever
[13:24] <Speljohan_> he was the typical 4chan troll
[13:24] <Siiseli> veru uncreative
[13:24] <Azathoth> yeah...
[13:24] <Speljohan_> and he failed at trolling anyone
[13:24] <Siiseli> very uncreative
[13:24] <Siiseli> Azathoth, it's funny how we have more bans than users
[13:24] <Speljohan_> i am used to these kind of things
[13:24] <Azathoth> :D
[13:24] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:25] <Speljohan_> a pro troll would make us all rage at him/eachother
[13:25] <Siiseli> oh wait we don't
[13:25] <Siiseli> yes
[13:25] <Speljohan_> i attempted a troll once
[13:25] <Azathoth> i didn't even come close to raging :\
[13:25] <Speljohan_> it failed though
[13:25] <Speljohan_> i must be really really really really bad at trolling...
[13:25] <Speljohan_> i couldnt even get youtube to rage
[13:25] <Speljohan_> :(
[13:26] <Azathoth> lol
[13:26] <Siiseli> I just found it amusing
[13:26] <Azathoth> fail, speljohan
[13:26] <Siiseli> well stop trolling Speljohan_
[13:26] <Azathoth> making youtube rage is as simple as saying a video sucks
[13:26] <Siiseli> you suck REALLY bad if you can't get a flamewar started on youtube
[13:26] <Speljohan_> trolling youtubers is fun Siiseli
[13:26] <Speljohan_> yeah
[13:26] <Speljohan_> i know :(
[13:26] <Speljohan_> i was probably too obvious though
[13:26] <Azathoth> and they were like
[13:26] <Azathoth> YOU IS TROLLIN
[13:27] <Siiseli> you need to be subtle :|
[13:27] <Siiseli> start a conversation on the following things:
[13:27] <Siiseli> legislation of cannabis, religion(especially christianity), something to do with racism, politics
[13:27] <Speljohan_> hmmm
[13:27] <Siiseli> call the maker of the video stupid
[13:28] <Speljohan_> i got one good reply
[13:28] <Speljohan_> that actually believed it
[13:28] <Speljohan_> lolol
[13:28] <Speljohan_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2bQSlOP28M&feature=email
[13:28] <Siiseli> and you need to employ as many arguementive faults as possible
[13:28] <Speljohan_> that's the vid
[13:28] <KodaichiZero> wanna know one way to troll this IRC chat, any time of the day?
[13:28] <KodaichiZero> "Notch is never going to finish this game, we should all demand our money back"
[13:29] <Siiseli> hehe
[13:29] <Azathoth> lol
[13:29] <Speljohan_> haha
[13:29] <KodaichiZero> that will likely stir up some trouble
[13:29] <Speljohan_> i'm surprised said video didnt stir up people
[13:30] <Speljohan_> afterall, youtube is the home of emo's/true metal
[13:30] <Azathoth> i'm surprised you're a cool guy
[13:30] <Speljohan_> the two opposites
[13:30] <Azathoth> oh wait. you're not
[13:30] <Speljohan_> so it should have ended up as a massive fight

[13:33] <Azathoth> commenting on youtube videos is pointless
[13:33] <Azathoth> your comment just gets buried under shit
[13:33] <Speljohan_> i enjoy arguing there though
[13:33] <KodaichiZero> somewhat.
[13:33] <Speljohan_> it's a good time-waster
[13:33] <Speljohan_> when you have nothing else to do
[13:34] <Azathoth> and no one really cares what you have to say. they all just want to voice their opinions
[13:34] <Speljohan_> and it's a great source of hilarious quotes!
[13:34] <KodaichiZero> commenting on youtube videos just lets the uploader know he's getting attention
[13:34] <Speljohan_> lol true
[13:34] <Azathoth> youtube comments are where i look when i want to rage
[13:34] <Azathoth> which is never
[13:34] <Siiseli> :D
[13:34] <Siiseli> yes they're moronic
[13:34] <Speljohan_> i have gone beyond the "rage"-phase
[13:34] * Griskard_ (chatzilla@65.72-67-202.dynamic.dsl.syd.iprimus.net.au) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[13:34] <Azathoth> like if i wanted to rage real hard, i'd find a video on religion
[13:34] <Speljohan_> i am currently at the "sad idiots"-phase
[13:34] <Speljohan_> so i just find it funny
[13:35] <Siiseli> youtube comments helped me lose my trust in the future and current state of humanity
[13:35] <Siiseli> if not for the spelling alone
[13:35] <Azathoth> ^
[13:35] <Speljohan_> haha, i found the future of mankind doomed long before
[13:35] <Siiseli> then also for the sheer hatred and general attitude present in the comments
[13:35] <Siiseli> oh yes Speljohan_ me too
[13:35] <Siiseli> it just helped me m
[13:35] <Siiseli> more
[13:35] <Speljohan_> :P
[13:35] <KodaichiZero> the most unpopular videos are always better than the most popular ones.
[13:35] <Speljohan_> MTV is a huge factor for me
[13:35] <Speljohan_> and hollywood
[13:35] <Speljohan_> etc
[13:35] <Siiseli> oh yes the mtv started the whole thing
[13:35] <KodaichiZero> unless it's worthy of not being popular...
[13:35] <Azathoth> seriously. i don't know why people are so intollerant of eachother ;|
[13:36] <Speljohan_> yah Siiseli
[13:36] <Speljohan_> it's interesting though
[13:36] <Siiseli> mtv started the so called mtv generation
[13:36] <Azathoth> with one l
[13:36] <Azathoth> typo
[13:36] <Speljohan_> MTV started out as a great channel
[13:36] <Azathoth> intolerant*
[13:36] <Siiseli> the general attitude of that generation is.. "whatever."
[13:36] <Superwafflez> MTV... WAS brilliant...
[13:36] <Superwafflez> now...
[13:36] <Speljohan_> back in the 80's to early 90's MTV was actually a music channel
[13:36] <Siiseli> I'll find you guys a great talk about it
[13:36] <Speljohan_> and a fucking good one
[13:36] <Siiseli> please watch it! :3
[13:36] <KodaichiZero> MTV aparently just has talk shows now. I wouldn't know, i've never watched it
[13:36] <Superwafflez> Music channels now... uhh....
[13:36] <Speljohan_> yeah, it's bollocks KodaichiZero
[13:36] <Azathoth> music channels: "music? what's that?"
[13:37] <Superwafflez> I think I have V and Max or something
[13:37] <Siiseli> http://wimp.com/michaelwesch/
[13:37] <Siiseli> you guys need to watch this
[13:37] <Speljohan_> whatever MTV calls "music" is what the record companies pay MTV to show
[13:37] <Azathoth> "oh... just something you put in commercials between reality shows"
[13:37] <Speljohan_> the viewers have no say
[13:37] <Siiseli> I watched one show online that apparently airs on mtv
[13:37] <Siiseli> it was about this anime geeky girl who wanted to find a boyfriend
[13:37] <Siiseli> so they changed her
[13:37] <Azathoth> lol
[13:37] <Speljohan_> lold
[13:37] <Azathoth> yeah
[13:37] <Azathoth> my life as liz or whatever
[13:37] <Siiseli> into one of those fucked up blond fuckfaces
[13:37] <Speljohan_> wow
[13:37] <Siiseli> it was horrible
[13:37] <Azathoth> oh wait
[13:37] <Azathoth> no, you're talking about made
[13:38] <Siiseli> oh yes
[13:38] <Siiseli> made
[13:38] <Speljohan_> please, you are making me puke Siiseli
[13:38] <Siiseli> absolutely horrifuckingble stuff
[13:38] <Siiseli> I almost puked
[13:38] <Speljohan_> holy shit has it gone that far
[13:38] <Speljohan_> man
[13:38] <Siiseli> how could they teach kids that if they want to be accepted
[13:38] <Speljohan_> i hope star trek lore is correct!
[13:38] <Siiseli> they need to change and be like everyone else
[13:38] <Azathoth> thought you were talking about my life as liz, where they supposedly follow this geeky girl around irl... but it's all obviously staged
[13:38] <Speljohan_> april 5th, 2063, the day of the warpdrive
[13:38] <Siiseli> then they'll be happy and get everything they want
[13:38] <Siiseli> I mean it was so blatant about it
[13:38] <Speljohan_> c'mon time, roll faster!
[13:38] <Siiseli> it was really a stopper for me, sorta
[13:38] <Siiseli> I realized that fuck me man
[13:38] <KodaichiZero> lol
[13:38] <Siiseli> I'm not imagining this
[13:38] <Siiseli> that's ACTUALLY what the kids are getting
[13:39] <Speljohan_> everything is staged on tv
[13:39] <KodaichiZero> it's like MTV is bad to the point we can't ignore it anymore
[13:39] <Speljohan_> all dumb fucking reality shows
[13:39] <Siiseli> well of course man, but that's what they teach children
[13:39] <KodaichiZero> because it's damaging people
[13:39] <Siiseli> KodaichiZero, yes
[13:39] <Siiseli> god I hate tv
[13:39] <Azathoth> WAT ABOUT TOOL ACADEMY GUYS
[13:39] <Speljohan_> yeah
[13:39] <Azathoth> it's the best show ever
[13:39] <Speljohan_> i haven't watched tv in like 6 years
[13:39] <Speljohan_> except for when i'm eating sometimes
[13:39] <Azathoth> i hate how all the damn reality shows all follow the same exact fucking structure
[13:39] <Speljohan_> and then it is like viasat history
[13:39] <Azathoth> they're all the same
[13:39] <Siiseli> and I, being 17, have to witness the effects of tv everywhere
[13:39] <Speljohan_> or discovery channel
[13:39] <Superwafflez> You know what sucks. Pay TV with ads.
[13:39] <Superwafflez> =/
[13:39] <Siiseli> and with the internet offering a new way of getting out of this horrible anonymity
[13:40] <Azathoth> erm.... history channel sucks now too
[13:40] <Siiseli> all those morons
[13:40] <Speljohan_> i wouldnt know Azathoth
[13:40] <Siiseli> who want to be famous
[13:40] <Speljohan_> i see like 15 mins every week
[13:40] <Siiseli> gather up in youtube
[13:40] <Siiseli> and spread their moronity
[13:40] <Siiseli> THAT is why the commments are so fucked up
[13:40] <Speljohan_> probably
[13:40] <Azathoth> anyway, i think the human race is going to descend back into barbarism
[13:40] <Speljohan_> although, i see all these morons as an opportunity Siiseli
[13:40] <Siiseli> if you want a good video site
[13:40] <Speljohan_> an opportunity to make money!

[13:41] <Siiseli> it's what youtube should be
[13:41] <KodaichiZero> at least barbarism is somewhat honorabl
[13:41] <Speljohan_> i wish we could go back to the pre-industrial era Azathoth
[13:41] <Siiseli> Speljohan_, that they are, but really they are also our future
[13:41] <Siiseli> they will be our taxpayers and future deciders
[13:41] <Speljohan_> yeah, it's a fucking shame Siiseli
[13:41] <Siiseli> what will their values be like, they're going to be in politics one day
[13:41] <Siiseli> deciding about our stuff
[13:41] <Superwafflez> Not barbarism, but a ruthless technology fuled future.
[13:41] <Speljohan_> in a matter of years Siiseli it will be like
[13:41] <Azathoth> i just think we need some serious police states up in this shit :P
[13:41] <KodaichiZero> society today is really sad when you step back and look at it
[13:41] <Speljohan_> more braindead advertisement
[13:41] <Siiseli> KodaichiZero, it is
[13:41] <Speljohan_> for politicians
[13:42] <Siiseli> Speljohan_, advertising is far from braindead
[13:42] <Superwafflez> Expect capital punishment to make a comeback
[13:42] <Speljohan_> i mean the advertisements will become braindead Siiseli
[13:42] <Speljohan_> as in
[13:42] <Siiseli> advertising is like the peak of psychological appliances
[13:42] <Siiseli> on aexploiting the human mind to ones own advantages
[13:42] <Speljohan_> similar to what current tv shows
[13:42] <Speljohan_> tbh none of the advertisements on tv even remotely appeals to me
[13:42] <Speljohan_> in any way
[13:42] <Speljohan_> i refuse to buy anything i see on tv
[13:43] <Speljohan_> as a principle
[13:43] <Siiseli> Speljohan_, well most aren't like that
[13:43] <Speljohan_> i know
[13:43] <Siiseli> I'
[13:43] <Speljohan_> but plenty are
[13:43] <Siiseli> I've studied psychology
[13:43] <Siiseli> and I've studied the history of advertising
[13:43] <Siiseli> and marketing
[13:43] <Siiseli> a lot
[13:43] <Speljohan_> yeah, i have plenty of friends who have as well
[13:43] <Azathoth> it's gotten to a point, where i see all the obvious propaganda and subliminal messaging in advertisements. and it makes me sad to think that there are people dumb enough to fall for that shit
[13:43] <Siiseli> I can tell you, what people buy is not up to them most of the time
[13:43] <KodaichiZero> as soon as they figure out how to beam images directly into our minds, advertising will take it over
[13:43] <Speljohan_> i know Siiseli
[13:43] <Siiseli> Azathoth, absolutely, that's a good stage to be in
[13:43] <Siiseli> to be aware
[13:44] <Siiseli> now, if you start looking around you, which you propably do
[13:44] <Siiseli> you will see the same patterns in social behaviour
[13:44] <Speljohan_> noshit
[13:44] <Siiseli> "how can people be this stupid and fall for that"
[13:44] <Siiseli> people are morons
[13:44] <Speljohan_> yes
[13:44] <Siiseli> they're a gray mass of sheep
[13:44] <Speljohan_> old news
[13:44] <Speljohan_> it's in human nature
[13:44] <Siiseli> that can be controlled any way one wants, if one knows how to
[13:44] <Speljohan_> the leaders and the plebs
[13:44] <Azathoth> i've kind of descended into being an anti-social shut in
[13:44] <Siiseli> I suppose yes
[13:44] <KodaichiZero> because fitting in is awesome or something
[13:44] <Azathoth> -_-

[13:47] <Peerko> that's very healthy, Speljohan_
[13:47] <Speljohan_> it wasn't "LEARN THIS OR FAIL"
[13:47] <Speljohan_> it was
[13:47] <Speljohan_> "ENLIGHTEN YOURSELF, FIND AN AREA OF INTEREST AND PURSUE IT"
[13:47] <Superwafflez> wow
[13:47] <Superwafflez> school's like jail in aus
[13:47] <Superwafflez> last year though...
[13:47] <Speljohan_> so i've heard
[13:48] <Speljohan_> sweden is pretty open about education
[13:48] <Speljohan_> take our private schools for instance
[13:48] <Speljohan_> i cant mention a single religious private school here
[13:48] <Superwafflez> school here is like... sit in rooms with a moron teacher that went straight form school to uni and back to school, 8:30 to 3:00
[13:48] <Azathoth> i think i'm the way i am because i've always overanalyzed everything
[13:49] <Speljohan_> they are all just a more free way of education
[13:49] <Speljohan_> and usually they are more prone to teach self-awareness
[13:49] <Peerko> Azathoth: in that case: find people to talk to and balance your views
[13:49] <Speljohan_> lol when i went to school Superwafflez it was very cool
[13:49] <Speljohan_> all ours teachers had a genuine interest in what they did
[13:50] <Speljohan_> hell, we had a teacher who worked 4 hours extra every day with no extra pay
[13:50] <Speljohan_> just because he loved teaching
[13:50] <Superwafflez> Nowadays their genuine interest is getting paid.
[13:50] <Azathoth> where the hell did you go to school?
[13:50] <Speljohan_> halmstad, sweden Azathoth !
[13:50] <Azathoth> god dammit
[13:50] <Speljohan_> we have lots of schools like this
[13:50] <Speljohan_> a very progressive education system
[13:50] <Azathoth> scandinavian countries are all fucking utopias D:
[13:51] <Superwafflez> yep
[13:51] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:51] <Superwafflez> $60 AUD for unlimited 100Mbit internet and phone? DO WANT
[13:51] <Speljohan_> $36 here
[13:51] <Speljohan_> :D
[13:51] <Superwafflez> i was looking at bredbandsbolaget lol
[13:51] <Azathoth> over 9000 here
[13:52] <Speljohan_> o
[13:52] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:52] <Speljohan_> yeah, we only have 2 or 3 isp's that provide 100mbps
[13:52] <Speljohan_> though, in total we have like 400-500 providers
[13:52] <Superwafflez> jesus
[13:52] <Speljohan_> it's funny because sweden tends to be called "communist" by conservative americans
[13:52] <Azathoth> seriously though... sweden is as close to heaven as it gets
[13:52] <Speljohan_> yet we have a ridiculous amount of companies
[13:52] <Azathoth> you know, americans are dumb shits
[13:53] <Speljohan_> the government only owns like 3 companies
[13:53] <Speljohan_> and for good reasons
[13:53] <Speljohan_> :P
[13:53] <Superwafflez> http://bc.whirlpool.net.au/ look at our shitty ass internet plans
[13:53] <MercilessTD> hows piracy in sweden
[13:53] <Azathoth> any time a democrat is elected, everyone goes "baaaaawwww socialist!"
[13:53] <Speljohan_> shit MercilessTD
[13:53] * KrimZon (krimzon@93-97-68-96.zone5.bethere.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
[13:53] <Speljohan_> only thing i hate about sweden
[13:53] <Speljohan_> is the goddamn pirate party
[13:53] <Speljohan_> and all the populist-kids
[13:53] <Speljohan_> "OMG WE MUST REMOVE ALL PATENTS SO I CAN DOWNLOAD SHIT FOR FREE OLOLOLOL"
[13:53] <Speljohan_> fucking idiots
[13:54] <Azathoth> meh
[13:54] <Azathoth> piracy is idiotic
[13:54] <Speljohan_> yeah
[13:54] <Speljohan_> i agree, it needs to be resolved
[13:54] <Speljohan_> but not in such a stupid fucking way
[13:54] <Azathoth> if everyone was a pirate, no one would buy software
[13:54] <Azathoth> if no one bought software, it wouldn't get fucking made
[13:54] <Speljohan_> companies will always buy software tho
[13:54] <Superwafflez> should just bill people for whatever they pirate somehow
[13:54] <Superwafflez> not fine
[13:54] <Speljohan_> but yeah, it's pretty damn ridiculous
[13:55] <Speljohan_> the european telecom law provided something decent
[13:55] <Speljohan_> chance of getting your connection cut if you pirate 3 times in a row
[13:55] <Speljohan_> and get caught
[13:55] <Speljohan_> :P
[13:55] <Superwafflez> record companies need to realise it's not 1980 anymore
[13:55] <Superwafflez> and charge realisticly
[13:55] <Speljohan_> i agree
[13:55] <Speljohan_> actually it was way cheaper in the 80's
[13:55] <Speljohan_> WAY CHEAPER
[13:56] <Azathoth> as much as i hate paying for things that other people have put in time and money to make, i recognize that in order for an economy to function, there has to be money exchanged :\
[13:56] <Speljohan_> a new album was like $5-6 in todays exchange rate
[13:56] <Speljohan_> pretty sure piracy indirectly made them raise prises
[13:56] <Speljohan_> prices*
[13:56] <Speljohan_> as in
[13:56] <Superwafflez> I have no issue with pirating music or movies, but games - they cost a lot to make.
[13:56] <Azathoth> i think music has gotten pretty decently priced
[13:56] <Speljohan_> "OH PEOPLE ARE PIRATING, LETS RAISE THE PRICE"
[13:56] <Azathoth> $1 a song through digital distribution is nice
[13:57] <Speljohan_> i dislike digital distribution though
[13:57] <Superwafflez> $2 here in aus
[13:57] <Speljohan_> i'm a record collector :P
[13:57] <Superwafflez> I prefer CD's though...
[13:57] <Superwafflez> physical
[13:57] <Speljohan_> i prefer vinyls
[13:57] <Speljohan_> though i have around 800 cd's or so
[13:57] <Azathoth> the problem with digital downloads for music though is that it's usually proprietary or whatever
[13:57] <Azathoth> if you buy from itunes, you've got to have a gay ipod
[13:57] <Speljohan_> mh
[13:58] <Speljohan_> i rarely by new albums though
[13:58] <Azathoth> also, i hate having physical copies of stuff.
[13:58] <Speljohan_> mostly buy second hard
[13:58] <Speljohan_> mail-order
[13:58] <Azathoth> i don't buy any boxed games anymore
[13:58] <Speljohan_> i dont even buy games
[13:58] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:58] <Speljohan_> i never play anyway
[13:58] <Speljohan_> market is too oversaturated with shit
[13:58] <Superwafflez> Actually I love having an ipod, you aren't as much of a target as the guy with the new flashy zune.
[13:58] <Azathoth> i don't really listen to music, but if i did, i'd buy it online somewhere
[13:58] <Speljohan_> "LOOK AT THIS NEW COOL FPS"
[13:59] <Azathoth> meh
[13:59] <Speljohan_> i dont like ipod's because of the terrible sound quality Superwafflez
[13:59] <Azathoth> speljohan, some people genuinely enjoy things that you may not like
[13:59] <Speljohan_> apple usually makes high quality stuff
[13:59] <Speljohan_> but they really failed with the ipod
[13:59] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:59] <Superwafflez> Should plug it into a decent sound system
[13:59] <Speljohan_> and hear the flaws!
[13:59] <Speljohan_> it's the hardware that is bad
[13:59] <Superwafflez> well I own an iphone so it's kinda an ipod
[13:59] <Speljohan_> :P
[13:59] <Speljohan_> Azathoth it's not just me though
[14:00] <Speljohan_> it's a fact the market is oversaturated
[14:00] <Superwafflez> oversaturated with rubbish
[14:00] <Speljohan_> yep
[14:00] <Azathoth> rubbish in your opinion
[14:00] <Superwafflez> there's nothing new coming out
[14:00] <Superwafflez> its all the same
[14:00] <Speljohan_> like every other market that ends up driven my money rather than "fun"
[14:00] <Speljohan_> it has an occasional bright spot
[14:00] <Speljohan_> and then it goes downhill again
[14:00] <Speljohan_> there's a reason the indie-scene is rapidly growing :P
[14:01] <Superwafflez> the genres are exhausted
[14:01] <Speljohan_> plenty aren't Superwafflez
[14:01] <Speljohan_> like
[14:01] <Speljohan_> rts genre
[14:01] <Azathoth> so you can just be grumpy about it, or you can lower your expectations a little and find some enjoyment
[14:01] <Speljohan_> it is just being dumbed down
[14:01] <Speljohan_> i dont have high expectations Azathoth
[14:01] <Superwafflez> will not lower expectations.
[14:01] <Superwafflez> lol
[14:01] <Speljohan_> but a vast majority of new games are either fps's or dumbed down rts's
[14:02] <Superwafflez> yep
[14:02] <Speljohan_> i dislike fps's because i am shit at aiming
[14:02] <Azathoth> here's an awesome RTS game that you'll want to buy when it comes out: http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/3855/planets10.png

[14:02] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:02] <Superwafflez> lolwut
[14:02] <Speljohan_> tbh the rts market was cool up until 2006 or sumthin
[14:02] <Speljohan_> rise of nations, empire earth etc
[14:02] <Speljohan_> all great titles
[14:02] <Peerko> what went wrong?
[14:02] <Superwafflez> yeah
[14:02] <Azathoth> (that's my game btw)
[14:02] <Speljohan_> suddenly they just stopped making them
[14:02] <Azathoth> it's a space rts, on little planets.
[14:02] <Speljohan_> interesting concept
[14:03] * MercilessTD (MercilessT@115-64-20-105.static.tpgi.com.au) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.86 [Firefox 3.5.9/20100315083431])
[14:03] <Superwafflez> I need to make a good rts lol.
[14:03] <Azathoth> RTSes just all got the same
[14:03] <Superwafflez> Age of Empires needs to make a comeback.
[14:03] <Azathoth> once someone finds a good gameplay mechanic that works, everyone just copies it
[14:03] <Speljohan_> i dislike the progressive thing all rts's do now though
[14:03] <Azathoth> see: the mmo industry
[14:03] <Speljohan_> yeh Azathoth
[14:03] <Azathoth> progressive thing?
[14:03] <Superwafflez> THere were mmo's before wow
[14:03] <Superwafflez> but
[14:03] <Speljohan_> "LETS ADD RPG ELEMENTS"
[14:03] <Superwafflez> WoW got the formula right
[14:04] <Azathoth> MMOs at least had variety before wow
[14:04] <Speljohan_> it's very much dumbed down though Superwafflez
[14:04] <Speljohan_> yeah Azathoth
[14:04] <Speljohan_> the mmo devs aim for one month of profits now
[14:04] <Speljohan_> it's all about the hype
[14:04] <Speljohan_> then letting it die
[14:04] <Azathoth> have you played warhammer online?
[14:04] * AndrewPH is now known as AndrewPH|AFK
[14:04] <Speljohan_> found it terrible
[14:04] <Azathoth> it's almost literally a direct copy of wow
[14:04] <Superwafflez> heh
[14:04] <Speljohan_> i found wow terrible as well though
[14:04] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:04] <Azathoth> even the graphics look the same
[14:04] <Superwafflez> I tried WoW and just couldnt make myself like it
[14:04] <Azathoth> me too
[14:05] <Speljohan_> everquest was a decent theme park i guess
[14:05] <Speljohan_> at least it had some risk/reward
[14:05] <Speljohan_> and not arrows pointing you in every direction
[14:05] <Azathoth> i still say asheron's call is the best mmo ever made -_-
[14:05] <Speljohan_> i still say UO is the best mmo ever made :P
[14:05] <Azathoth> never played it
[14:05] <Speljohan_> shame
[14:05] <Azathoth> all this talk about dumbing down games makes me sad :|
[14:05] <Speljohan_> the first uo reviews thought it would become a revolution
[14:06] <Speljohan_> all games would follow what uo did
[14:06] <Azathoth> my game could probably be considered pretty dumbed down
[14:06] <Speljohan_> but none did
[14:06] <Azathoth> but mainly because i'm not a very good programmer
[14:06] <Speljohan_> today it's all bad excuses from clueless CEO's Azathoth
[14:06] <Speljohan_> "WE CANT ADD DROPABLE ITEMS IN THE WORLD BECAUSE OUR SERVERS CANT HANDLE IT"
[14:06] <Speljohan_> it's cus they are lazy
[14:06] <Speljohan_> and/or clueless
[14:06] <Azathoth> ugh
[14:07] <Peerko> probably more a matter of revenue, Speljohan_
[14:07] <Azathoth> lol matchmaking!
[14:07] <Speljohan_> Peerko, probably, but that is indirectly because they are clueless
[14:07] <Speljohan_> programmers are lazy thesedays
[14:07] <Speljohan_> computers are fast

[14:07] <Speljohan_> they dont optimize
[14:07] <Speljohan_> not like they used to anyways
[14:07] <Azathoth> i've noticed that
[14:08] <Peerko> the art is lost
[14:08] <Speljohan_> yeh
[14:08] <Speljohan_> like all media
[14:08] <Peerko> also, it's not something everyone can do
[14:08] <Peerko> I haven't a clue about most hardware
[14:08] <Azathoth> optimization is hard though. you have to basically be a robot
[14:08] <Peerko> and yes, I am too lazy to read specs
[14:08] <Speljohan_> Azathoth not really
[14:08] <MercilessTD> http://cgi.ebay.com.au/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=120553158839&ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT
[14:08] <Speljohan_> you just need to know dick about it
[14:08] <MercilessTD> mother of god
[14:08] <Speljohan_> which most people don't
[14:08] <Speljohan_> also
[14:09] <MercilessTD> BUYING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT
[14:09] <Speljohan_> when dev teams consist in hundreds of people
[14:09] <Peerko> also, what I said
[14:09] <Speljohan_> it's impossible to properly manage
[14:09] <Azathoth> when dev teams consist of hundreds of people....
[14:09] <Azathoth> 99% of them are in the graphics department
[14:09] <Peerko> management is not so much an issue as it's not impossible
[14:09] <Speljohan_> yeah that too
[14:09] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:09] <Speljohan_> take UO as prime example
[14:09] <Speljohan_> due to the primitive graphics
[14:09] <Peerko> impossible for clueless CEO's, yes
[14:09] <Speljohan_> team was about 15 people
[14:10] <Speljohan_> 15 people, and it's still more advanced than any new mmorpg is
[14:10] <Speljohan_> advanced in terms of gameplay
[14:10] <Speljohan_> not graphics of course :P
[14:10] <Azathoth> don't get me wrong, i think good looking games are really nice
[14:11] <Azathoth> i just think we need to find a better balance between looks and gameplay
[14:11] <Peerko> and let me add DF to that showcase
[14:11] <Speljohan_> i tend to like traditional gameplay more though Azathoth
[14:11] <Azathoth> at the moment, graphics seem to take a priority in many mainstream titles
[14:11] <Speljohan_> as in, i prefer isometric 3d over fps
[14:11] <Speljohan_> or 3ps
[14:11] <Speljohan_> i like mouse movement
[14:11] <Speljohan_> because it's very casual
[14:11] <Speljohan_> mixing casual and hardcore is the best imo
[14:11] <Speljohan_> and that's what UO did
[14:11] <Speljohan_> ridiculously easy to learn
[14:12] <Speljohan_> but very harsh and violent
[14:12] <Speljohan_> :P
[14:12] <Azathoth> NOPE
[14:12] <Speljohan_> it's surprising people didn't shun uo when it came
[14:12] <Speljohan_> pk's running around killing noobs, cutting them up and cooking their bodyparts
[14:13] <Speljohan_> put their heads up as trophies in their homes
[14:13] <Speljohan_> collecting ears diablo-style
[14:13] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:13] <Seepia> someone talking about PAINKILLER?
[14:13] <Azathoth> when UO came out, games weren't that big
[14:13] <Speljohan_> yeh
[14:14] <Azathoth> painkiller is meh
[14:14] <Rithiur> Back then, only gamers played games and general populace didn't care..
[14:14] <Speljohan_> and uo was completely unexplored territory
[14:14] <Azathoth> too arcade for me
[14:14] <Speljohan_> back when it was good Rithiur
[14:14] <Speljohan_> :D
[14:14] <Seepia> you obv never enjoyed Q1
[14:14] <Azathoth> nope
[14:14] <Speljohan_> q1 was awesomesauce
[14:14] <Seepia> q1's still living :D
[14:14] <Speljohan_> age of empires 1 and q1 were my first games
[14:14] <Seepia> now its the hardest fps alive today
[14:14] <Speljohan_> yeh
[14:14] <Azathoth> aoe1 was my first game. i didn't get into FPSes until 2001 and after
[14:15] <Speljohan_> i stopped playing fps's in like 2000
[14:15] <Speljohan_> i saw nothing new
[14:15] <Speljohan_> the last fps i played was cod2
[14:15] <Speljohan_> for a brief period of time
[14:15] <Azathoth> *sigh*
[14:15] <Speljohan_> but i ended up realizing all fps's are pretty much the same, just different graphics and weapons
[14:15] <Speljohan_> oh, the new avp game was cool
[14:15] <Azathoth> and stories
[14:15] <Seepia> there's diff. categories of fps
[14:15] <Seepia> but only like, 2-3 of them
[14:15] <MercilessTD> you ausfags
[14:16] <Azathoth> the new avp kinda sucks :|
[14:16] <MercilessTD> old enough to remember hey hey it's sat
[14:16] <Seepia> yes
[14:16] <MercilessTD> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep8FHim97dw
[14:16] <MercilessTD> remember that?
[14:16] <Speljohan_> it's the first multiplayer fps i've enjoyed in years Azathoth
[14:16] <Superwafflez> oh god hey hey
[14:16] <Azathoth> heh, me too
[14:16] <Seepia> oh man this goes waaay back
[14:16] <Superwafflez> coming back... on a wednesday...
[14:16] <Azathoth> i only play singleplayer games generally, though
[14:16] <Speljohan_> me too
[14:16] <Speljohan_> except for rts's
[14:16] <MercilessTD> i nostalgiad watching this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep8FHim97dw
[14:16] <Speljohan_> their strength lies within multiplayer
[14:16] <MercilessTD> classic
[14:17] <Azathoth> i especially play RTSes in singleplayer... because i don't stand a chance against real people
[14:17] <Speljohan_> find friends who play
[14:17] <Azathoth> except i did get pretty good at dawn of war
[14:17] <Speljohan_> yeah, i have a friend who got ridiculously good at dow Azathoth
[14:17] <Speljohan_> in 1 month he was in the world championship
[14:17] <Speljohan_> got 11th place lol
[14:17] <Azathoth> it's one of the better RTSes of recent times
[14:17] <chibifs> Hey guys ipad
[14:18] <Azathoth> iperiod
[14:18] <chibifs> Did you know that ipad?
[14:18] <Speljohan_> not too much of a fan Azathoth
[14:18] <chibifs> wololo
[14:18] <Speljohan_> i am still waiting for a decent aoe clone
[14:18] <Seepia> iMmature
[14:18] <Azathoth> i also really like company of heroes
[14:18] <Azathoth> but dawn of war 2 was kinda fail :(
[14:18] <Speljohan_> i tend to dislike modern age rts's
[14:18] <Speljohan_> and even moreso static maps
[14:18] <Seepia> C&C4 is the biggest pile of..
[14:18] <Speljohan_> i like randomization
[14:18] <Speljohan_> huge maps
[14:18] <Speljohan_> etc
[14:18] <Speljohan_> yeah, it's shit Seepia
[14:19] <MercilessTD> red alert 3 was dissappoint
[14:19] <Azathoth> CoH is fun though
[14:19] <Azathoth> everything can get blown up
[14:19] <Azathoth> the map changes in the course of the game
[14:19] <Seepia> Raped and pillaged a classic franchise
[14:19] <Speljohan_> i played coh a little
[14:19] <Speljohan_> but never got into it
[14:19] <Azathoth> and it actually affects the gameplay
[14:19] <Speljohan_> i prefer grand-strategy titles anyways
[14:19] <Speljohan_> civ series are great
[14:19] <Azathoth> yes
[14:19] <Speljohan_> and for the real nerds, paradox's games

[14:20] <Speljohan_> so much to keep track of

[14:21] <Seepia> I never got into :I
[14:21] <Azathoth> i've tried a few so-called hardcore strategy games only to find daunting interfaces, stupid ridiculous micromanagement, and little to no in-game help
[14:21] <Speljohan_> hence why they are labeled hardcore Azathoth
[14:21] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:21] <Speljohan_> tbh hearts of iron is more of a simulation
[14:21] <Azathoth> meh
[14:21] <Seepia> master of orion 1/2 are the only strategy games ive ever loved
[14:21] <Speljohan_> a wwii simulator
[14:22] <Speljohan_> good games Seepia

[14:22] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:22] <Azathoth> space 4X games are really fun
[14:22] <Azathoth> sadly, i've never really played any of the great classics
[14:22] <Speljohan_> i prefer games on planets
[14:22] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:22] <Azathoth> like the MoO ones
[14:23] <Azathoth> :D
[14:23] <Azathoth> like my game?
[14:23] <Speljohan_> more like no space at all :P
[14:23] <Azathoth> aw
[14:23] <Speljohan_> but yours had a neat look to it Azathoth
[14:23] <Speljohan_> i generally prefer familiar environments
[14:24] <Speljohan_> i have no clue what a d4354563 positronic pulse rifle is
[14:24] <Speljohan_> i know what a spear is
[14:24] <Speljohan_> :D
[14:24] <Seepia> but is the spear more or less powerful than the crossbow?
[14:24] <Speljohan_> haha
[14:24] <Azathoth> it doesn't hurt to use a little imagination, you know
[14:24] <Azathoth> and according to civilization, those two might be evenly matched :S
[14:24] <Speljohan_> i am too lazy to learn Azathoth
[14:25] <Speljohan_> according to civilization, my knight can beat an apache
[14:25] <Azathoth> in fact, that spear could take on a tank
[14:25] <Azathoth> yeah
[14:25] <Speljohan_> aoe has great balance for it though
[14:25] <Speljohan_> aoe2 that is
[14:25] <Speljohan_> there's only one op tactic
[14:26] <Speljohan_> and that is spamming heavy cavalry archers and paladins
[14:26] <Speljohan_> doesnt matter how many pikemen you have, it's impossible to stop
[14:26] <Azathoth> heavy gays
[14:26] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:26] <Speljohan_> though people rarely use that "tactic"
[14:26] <Speljohan_> because it's unfair
[14:26] <Azathoth> nope
[14:26] <Azathoth> i really should get to bed now
[14:26] <Speljohan_> lol

[17:07] <Quatroking> I should go and visit the Perfetti Van Melle factory sometime
[17:07] <Quatroking> they're the owners and creators of Mentos and I wonder if i can buy a bunch of foreing flavours
[17:07] <Quatroking> foreign*
[17:07] <Quatroking> for example banana and citrus mango are only sold in Japan
[17:09] <ZomBuster> but they are made there?
[17:09] <Quatroking> I think so
[17:10] <Quatroking> the mentos rolls always say "product of Holland"

[17:35] <IDTL> I don't think you understand lucifer
[17:35] <LuciferZ> Do not make excuses to avoid the truth, IDTL
[17:35] <IDTL> It's a way of life
[17:35] <IDTL> Do not alter the truth
[17:35] <LuciferZ> Not to Notch.
[17:35] <IDTL> Notch is notch
[17:35] <LuciferZ> It is unfortunate that you have developed such an attachment to something that is only a game.
[17:35] <IDTL> But I haven't
[17:35] <LuciferZ> Because Notch likes doing things besides Minecraft.
[17:36] <LuciferZ> And if you can't understand that, then you are an idiot.
[17:36] <IDTL> No he doesn't
[17:36] <LuciferZ> And now you know.

[17:39] <IDTL> What is it anyway?
[17:39] <FakeSky> I like pirates.
[17:39] <Superwafflez> Cant get it anywhere, so it's abandonware.
[17:39] <Superwafflez> Banned so much they stopped selling it.
[17:39] <Kokopure> says no linking to illegal things right in the rules, Wafflez
[17:39] <Kokopure> sheesh
[17:39] <Superwafflez> It's not illegal
[17:39] <Kokopure> if it's sold it's illegal
[17:39] <IDTL> It's freee
[17:39] <Kokopure> if it's banned it's still illegal
[17:39] <IDTL> It's free man
[17:39] <Superwafflez> It's not sold.
[17:40] <Superwafflez> It's abandonware.
[17:40] <Kokopure> is it banned?
[17:40] <Superwafflez> Yes.
[17:40] <IDTL> No man, it's free
[17:40] <Kokopure> then it's illegal
[17:40] <Kokopure> it was banned for a reason
[17:40] <Superwafflez> Banned means you just cant acquire it.
[17:40] <Superwafflez> You can still own it.
[17:40] <LuciferZ> So by linking us to a torrent of it
[17:40] <Kokopure> I do believe you're linking so people can acquire it.
[17:40] <LuciferZ> You are trying to get us to commit a felony
[17:40] <Superwafflez> Banned in the sense you cant acquire it through usual means.
[17:41] <Kokopure> Lucifer, how don't you have @?
[17:41] <Kokopure> you seem like the most reasonable person here
[17:41] <LuciferZ> Because I occasionally rage maybe, lol.

[17:46] <Audiopulse> Im looking for help. Id like to buy Minecraft...
[17:46] <Audiopulse> however. Im located in germany. I do not trust Paypal and Creditcards arent big here...
[17:46] <LuciferZ> Hmmm.
[17:46] <Superwafflez> Get a prepaid visa
[17:46] <Audiopulse> Transactions outside the EU are expensive
[17:47] <Audiopulse> Already looked that up - same as creditcards
[17:47] <Superwafflez> Prepaid visa is the way to go
[17:47] <Superwafflez> Ah
[17:47] <Superwafflez> should be able to get one at a post office or something
[17:47] <Audiopulse> even if id get one - theyre mostly not accepted at shops here
[17:47] <LuciferZ> Well, I can tell you that PayPal is secure
[17:47] <LuciferZ> But it can occasionally be slow.
[17:47] <Audiopulse> So id make an acc and load 10??? on ...
[17:48] <LuciferZ> And then never have to touch it again.
[17:48] <Audiopulse> would i be in time? I heard that the price will be raised soon...?

[17:48] <Superwafflez> probably
[17:48] <Superwafflez> at earliest a week
[17:48] <Audiopulse> week or month now? :)
[17:48] <Audiopulse> mmmh..
[17:48] <LuciferZ> What? Superwaffles, Notch is not that insane
[17:49] <LuciferZ> No one can code that fast, lol
[17:49] <Superwafflez> He tweeted =D
[17:49] <Audiopulse> what about sending the money directly to notch? Wasnt he from Sweden or so?
[17:49] <Superwafflez> he's gonna try get infdev mp up by the weekend
[17:50] <LuciferZ> I'm not sure about that Audiopulse. You would have to email him about that.
[17:50] <Audiopulse> what about sending the money directly to notch?
[17:50] <LuciferZ> It's probably the best way to handle it.
[17:50] <Superwafflez> Definetly email him about that
[17:50] <Audiopulse> hmm, good - would you happen to know the emailaddress?
[17:50] <Malikat> notch@mojang.com i believe
[17:50] <Malikat> it's on minecraft.net

[17:50] <Audiopulse> kay, ill go look it up. Thanks a bunch!
[17:50] <Malikat> oh. derp
[17:50] <Malikat> that.
[17:51] <LuciferZ> No problem Audio. Good luck
[17:51] <IDTL> But with the money you donate to notch, you could buy a cheap game
[17:51] <IDTL> or a sandwich!
[17:52] <Malikat> or a cheap sandwich
[17:52] <LuciferZ> Or a sandwich game

[20:20] <Marach> irc://
[20:20] <Kald> On the community page, there's a link that directly connects you to this channel and server. It even starts up mIRC for you.
[20:21] <Kald> I just thought it was nifty
[20:21] <Marach> browser starts mirc
[20:21] <Quatroking> uh
[20:21] <Kald> ...
[20:21] <Demki> for me it started mibbit
[20:21] <Quatroking> every good browser should be capable of using different protocols for different programs

[20:22] <Marach> Demki: because you dont have a NORMAL client installed
[20:22] <Demki> I don't ANY client
[20:22] <Marach> Demki: fail
[20:22] <Quatroking> unless you're using something like, IE 6 or something shitty like facebook it should simply open up the client you use for IRC or ask you what program to use with the protocl
[20:22] <Quatroking> protocol*
[20:22] <Kald> Mibbit is like the rotting goat cheese to mIRC's fine bri.
[20:23] <Quatroking> pffft
[20:23] <Quatroking> mirc is a piece of commercial shit
[20:23] <Quatroking> xchat 2 ftw
[20:23] <Marach> mibbit is to irc what 4chan is to internet
[20:23] <LuciferZ> The source of its power?
[20:23] <Kald> mIRC is to Mibbit what 99chan is to 4chan

[20:25] <Quatroking> he also inhaled your ipod
[20:25] <Kald> ...inhaled your USB drive? Does that happen to you often?
[20:25] <Quatroking> uh
[20:25] <Kald> Maybe you should worry about helping the poor guy instead of trying to connect with mibbit
[20:25] <Quatroking> autistic kids with an obsession of inhaling random objects?

[20:35] <LuciferZ> Nice

[20:47] <Kald> It's been confirmed on the wiki that eventually, torches will burn out after a while (how long has not been confirmed)

[20:48] <Kald> Luminescent ore, maybe somewhere between coal and iron in rarity. If you harvest 9 of them and forge them into a block, they'd light up the area like a torch, but indefinitely. If you leave the ores in the wall, they will also spread glow, but much less than a torch
[20:48] <bildramer> oh look

[20:50] <LuciferZ> I like that idea.
[20:50] <LuciferZ> I've always wanted glowing ore.
[20:50] <LuciferZ> Perhaps the block would be some sort of large crystal?
[20:50] <Quatroking> ...
[20:50] <LuciferZ> Or a brazier filled with them. That would be sexy too.
[20:50] <Quatroking> Minecraftia is one huge cube.
[20:50] <Kald> Just an enlargening of the diamond gem sprite, in 3d, but maybe lighter?
[20:50] <Kald> Of 1X1X1 dimensions
[20:51] <LuciferZ> Yeah. Maybe a different colorl.
[20:51] <LuciferZ> Blue would be nice but then it's just hard to distinguish from diamond. So perhaps green?
[20:51] <LuciferZ> And then notch can have his emerald.
[20:51] <bildramer> colorl
[20:51] <LuciferZ> Bildramer you are dumb
[20:52] <Kald> Would they spread green light, too?
[20:52] <Kald> Seems like that could be kinda annoying.
[20:52] <bildramer> I'm not.

[20:53] <Kald> You place three individual glass blocks in each row of 3X3, but you leave out the one in the middle and the middle of the bottom row
[20:53] <Kald> Combine your glass lense with one of the shiny gems
[20:53] <LuciferZ> Obviously I meant to say "color" but I did not correct myself because only a total numbskull would be confused by the 'l' on the end.

[20:54] <Kald> Because as we all know the only way to grab something is to mack it with your fist.
[20:54] <LuciferZ> It was a dumb joke.
[20:54] <Kald> So the lenses'd shatter when you pick up the thing again, but the gem wouldn't.
[20:54] <LuciferZ> Lol, that would be cool, but also annoying.
[20:54] <Kald> So you'd need lots of lenses for a large mine, and you'd lose them when you abandon a shaft.
[20:54] <LuciferZ> It would need to be very bright.

[20:56] <Kald> ...oh, how 'bout this
[20:56] <Kald> If you place one of the gems without a lens
[20:56] <Kald> You get maybe 1/4th the light of a torch.
[20:56] <Kald> Handy in a pinch, but by no means suitable for prolonged use.
[20:56] <Quatroking> woo, another 30 wallpapers in my wallpaper folder
[20:57] <Kald> Also: they could be used underwater.
[20:57] <Kald> Which is handy when you're building, y' know
[20:57] <Kald> An underground base.
[20:57] <LuciferZ> That would be pretty useful, if just for the water purpose.

[21:33] <Rooster> Quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason, also eat plenty of oatmeal, and animals never had a war. Who's the real animal?
[21:34] <LuciferZ> wut
[21:34] <Malikat> quantum physics is actually more interesting than that
[21:34] <Malikat> it means that nothing can be exactly predicted
[21:34] <Rooster> And can happen at any time for no fucking reason
[21:34] <Malikat> in theory.
[21:34] <Yourself> actually chimpanzees go to war all the time
[21:34] <Malikat> what quantum physics DOES do
[21:34] <Yourself> and i wouldn't describe it as happening for no reason
[21:35] <Marach> it fails
[21:35] <Rooster> No, they just fight with each other
[21:35] <Malikat> is allow things that allow quantum effects to escalate to have non-predictable outcomes
[21:35] <Rooster> It depends on your definition of "war"
[21:35] <Malikat> for instance
[21:35] <Yourself> well if you define it as something only humans do, then it's stupid to say only humans do it
[21:35] <Malikat> if neurons have parts that are on a quantum scale
[21:35] <Malikat> then thought would make sense!
[21:36] <Malikat> ants go to war

[21:37] <Yourself> and the functioning of the entire brain is even larger than that
[21:37] <Yourself> it's governed almost entirely by classical effects
[21:37] <Malikat> yes, but the functioning of the entire brain is just a collection of gajillions of individual neurons
[21:37] <Yourself> not to say that it's predictable in any sort of practical notion
[21:37] <Yourself> since behavior isn't governed entirely by what's inside the brain, but also all the sensory input that comes into it
[21:38] <Yourself> so in that sense quantum effects could influence it
[21:38] <Malikat> well, yeah. there's a large amount of chaos theory in there

[22:04] <Malikat> you just have no imagination
[22:04] <Malikat> combat will not be "I STAND NEXT TO YOU AND SWING"
[22:04] <Malikat> it will be a lot of dancing around trying to hit without BEING hit.
[22:05] <Malikat> and that is where the skilled players will emerge
[22:05] <Rooster> Well, to the player, it's going to look like jumping around madly
[22:05] <Rooster> But I can see what your getting at
[22:05] <Malikat> jumping would actually be really really bad
[22:05] <Malikat> because minecraft has very poor air control
[22:05] <Rooster> Sword right now, it can just spam click
[22:05] <Malikat> so if you jumped, you would be easy to hit
[22:05] <Malikat> thus why i think swing speed should be limited.

[23:11] <vurtual> nah
[23:11] <vurtual> all of our technology is based off of those systems

[23:12] <Yourself> Snowman: tradition
[23:12] <vurtual> yeah, but have you ever learned to fly using a completely alien system?
[23:12] <vurtual> Where all the units are different?
[23:12] <vurtual> It's not easy, especially under stress
[23:12] <Yourself> it's too difficult/expensive to get the entire world to switch at the same time
[23:12] <Yourself> and with international travel, doing it piecemeal would be a logistical nightmare

[23:17] <Ten_Tacles> Hell is funny :D

[23:19] <vurtual> It's the 21st century, not just that, IT'S TWO THOUSAND AND TEEEEN. You can't expect people to do math in their heads.
[23:19] <Yourself> how many cubic mm are in one ml?
[23:20] <bildramer> er
[23:20] <bildramer> we're not talking about having 2 system
[23:20] <vurtual> google says 1000?
[23:20] <bildramer> just screw anything non-metric
[23:20] <bildramer> it's obsolete
[23:20] <rbos> Yourself: depends on the material
[23:20] <vurtual> bildramer, okay, here's the fun part though
[23:20] <rbos> oh wait, no
[23:20] <bildramer> I dislike base-12-or-4-or-2-or-6-or-7
[23:20] <Yourself> rbos, they're both units of volume :P
[23:20] <rbos> i was thinking density
[23:20] <rbos> yeah
[23:20] <rbos> my bad
[23:21] <Yourself> vurtual, these are just single conversions
[23:21] <vurtual> here's the choice: A committee decided on system, that's rigidly 10
[23:21] <Yourself> imagine having to do about 20 of these
[23:21] <bildramer> what?
[23:21] <vurtual> Or, a system that'd been successfully in use for ages upon ages
[23:21] <Yourself> using units that don't have any real physical significance
[23:21] <Yourself> and are arbitrarily related to one another through arbitrary conversion factors
[23:21] <vurtual> Now I ain't lettin' no committee tellin' me how to measure mah bullets.
[23:21] <vurtual> or how far my car has driven
[23:21] <bildramer> heck, everybody just can't convert
[23:21] <vurtual> If you want to change those measurements, come and get them.
[23:21] <bildramer> vurtual: bullets in dozens
[23:21] <Splatticus> The things you guys choose to argue about is quite simply astounding, like seriously.
[23:21] <rbos> vurtual: actually, standardized Imperial measurements are much younger than metric
[23:21] <bildramer> and distance in meters
[23:22] <vurtual> Yourself, one foot is roughly around the length of your foot give or take alot
[23:22] <rbos> a "foot" has meant different things to different peoiple for ages
[23:22] <vurtual> kids learned inches by their fingers
[23:22] <Splatticus> I'm waiting for someone to whip up an argument about which Rock'em Sock'em Robot was better, Blue, or Red?
[23:22] <vurtual> people are around 6 feet tall
[23:22] <bildramer> now how many inches are 40 and one half feet?
[23:22] <Yourself> people have not always been around that tall
[23:22] <vurtual> bullets are generally under half an inch
[23:22] <rbos> even today there's like 20 different definitions of "gallon"
[23:22] <Yourself> in fact, on average people are shorter than that by at least 2 inches
[23:22] <rbos> or "ounce"
[23:22] <vurtual> They may have been arbitrary once
[23:23] <vurtual> But since we use them everywhere, they already define everything easily
[23:23] <outsomnia> Gallon: 25 iphones worth of volume.
[23:23] <genida> One of the definitions being 'the reason the US goes to war'. Eh, Yourself?
[23:23] <vurtual> okay you're not allowed to use kilobytes anymore
[23:23] <vurtual> screw your kilobytes
[23:23] <vurtual> committee says you must use kibibytes for your system
[23:23] <rbos> the metric system is *older* than any sensible standardized imperial
[23:23] <vurtual> nothing else, ok
[23:23] <Yourself> genida: i guess so
[23:23] <outsomnia> [12:23] <vurtual> screw your kilobytes
[23:23] <outsomnia> You would, wouldn't you?
[23:23] <rbos> that's why they invented metric, because there WAS no standardized imperial system
[23:23] <Yourself> we tried switching to metric once and the one thing that stuck was 2 liter bottles
[23:23] <vurtual> YOUR COMPUTERS ARE IN BASE 2, MAKE THEM BASE 10

[23:24] <bildramer> also, 2^10 = 10^3
[23:24] <Serow> 2 liters are the only thing I know in Metric. :[
[23:24] <bildramer> +- 2.4%
[23:24] <vurtual> My computers are base 2, my things are mostly in standard systems
[23:24] <Yourself> 2^10 ~= 10^3
[23:24] <vurtual> No these systems don't do obscure stuff like "40 and a half feet" in inches
[23:24] <bildramer> fine approximation
[23:24] <KodaichiZero> lol vurtual me and vede went on this exact same rant last night
[23:24] <vurtual> I cannot even remotely find any reason to need that
[23:24] <bildramer> urm
[23:24] <bildramer> vurtual, metric is base-10
[23:24] <bildramer> all of it
[23:24] <vurtual> so?
[23:25] <bildramer> to convert units, just multiply/divide
[23:25] <vurtual> You know, we should just all be men, boning eachother. It's standardized.
[23:25] <Yourself> actually, to conver you just shift digits
[23:25] <vurtual> bildramer, tell my laptop to use base 10
[23:25] <Yourself> easier than multiplying or dividing
[23:25] <rbos> a gigabyte is 10^9 bytes, and fuckyou if you think it should be rounded to some base 2 variant
[23:25] <KodaichiZero> 2^10n = 10^3n * 1.024^n

[23:27] <genida> I smell nerdrage, zero.
[23:27] <zeroZshadow> we'r having a nice metric VS miles system ?

[23:28] <outsomnia> Wadafak
[23:28] <bildramer> yes all of it

[23:28] <genida> I think it's called Imperial?
[23:28] <Yourself> well tell me when, so i can leave
[23:28] <vurtual> Rednecks will win any war they want, every time.
[23:28] <outsomnia> Metric vs Miles is like 100 vs 1
[23:28] <vurtual> Every last time.
[23:28] <outsomnia> That's not fair bro.
[23:28] <KodaichiZero> how many kilometers in a foot hurf durf
[23:28] <zeroZshadow> you do know that because of the useage of MILES nasa crashed a mars lander ?
[23:28] <bildramer> haha
[23:28] <bildramer> good for everyone else
[23:28] <zeroZshadow> because everyone but some where using metrics
[23:28] <vurtual> zeroZshadow, well, if someone started pumping air by liters instead of oz into a system
[23:28] <vurtual> the system would probably blow up
[23:28] <vurtual> so clearly metric is the evil magically messed up one right
[23:28] <bildramer> or have more fuel
[23:28] <vurtual> right guys
[23:29] <bildramer> hm
[23:29] <vurtual> right
[23:29] <rbos> speaking of ounces, aren't there like six different kinds of 'ounce'?
[23:29] <zeroZshadow> xD
[23:29] <vurtual> ounce and fluid oz
[23:29] <zeroZshadow> just stick to the meters
[23:29] <KodaichiZero> you know

[23:29] <bildramer> meters
[23:29] <bildramer> so yeah.
[23:29] <vurtual> bildramer, yes, it's a computer simulation
[23:29] <vurtual> meters make senes
[23:29] <zeroZshadow> bildramer, would make a nice motivational
[23:29] <Yourself> the use of pounds is also confusing
[23:29] <vurtual> HEY GUYS
[23:29] <Yourself> since a lot of people use it as a mass
[23:29] <Yourself> but it's really a force unit
[23:29] <vurtual> WE SHOULD ALL GO DRIVE OUR PERFECT, FRICTONLESS SPHERE CARS
[23:29] <bildramer> yeah
[23:29] <vurtual> IN A VOID
[23:29] <genida> Yes, rbos, wikipedia confirms six kinds of ounces.
[23:30] <Yourself> which has, unfortunately, led to the creation of "pound force" and "pound"
[23:30] <rbos> yeah, the imperial unit is 'slugs' for mass but no bugger uses it
[23:30] <vurtual> pounds
[23:30] <vurtual> pounds, tons.
[23:30] <bildramer> lol slugs
[23:30] <KodaichiZero> while you're at it, why not force the whole fucking world to speak English, that'd be way more convenient right?
[23:30] <bildramer> Also, metric ton = 1000kg
[23:30] <vurtual> I weigh like 120 pounds apparently, but can deal about 800 or so pounds of force through your spine
[23:30] <Ten_Tacles> SLUGMEN

[23:30] <Serow> With the way it's going, English is going to become some sort of trade language anyway.
[23:30] <bildramer> metric only has 1 unit for every different measurement type/thing
[23:30] <vurtual> which is, plus my weight, almost half a ton
[23:30] <genida> KodaichiZero, according to all movies about the future, that is going to happen :)

[23:38] <bildramer> right now
[23:38] <Yourself> imperial isn't built to "do" anything, it's a standardized system based on archaic and traditional measurements developed by humans before we knew jack shit about the universe

[23:38] <vurtual> I'm not gonna let the speed of light in a pure void tell me what to do
[23:38] <Yourself> using that argument any system of units is valid

[23:39] <outsomnia> Gais
[23:39] <bildramer> and a turdsec as 1/34th of a second
[23:39] <vurtual> Space travel works fine with metric because you have to do everything in a computer and with numbers
[23:39] <Yourself> rbos: originally, but now the meter is defined in terms of the speed of light
[23:39] <rbos> base metric units are as arbitrary as imperial, it's just that they're designed to inter-relate smoothly
[23:39] <bildramer> microturds are 1/1200000th of a turd
[23:39] <outsomnia> wut's the ideal amount of coal/wud/steel 2 hab in infdev?
[23:39] <Malikat> a lot.
[23:39] <Serow> We should make up a system of measurements based on the average length of uncooked spaghetti in supermarket boxes.
[23:39] <rbos> Yourself: yeah, X wavelengths or something. It's arbitrary, sure, but that's not why it's useful
[23:39] <vurtual> outsomnia chests full
[23:39] <outsomnia> okay

[23:40] <vurtual> because they make sure the length is around a certain one
[23:40] <Yourself> and the reason that number is so weird is because it came out really close to what the meter was defined to be prior to that

[23:41] <genida> Ten_Tacles, if you can get me an hours worth of that clip, I'll give you a hug. Preferably a HD DVD or something :)
[23:41] <vurtual> keep metric on the math-tables ok.
[23:41] <Ten_Tacles> Genida

[23:41] <Ten_Tacles> It does not exist.
[23:41] <rbos> I can't imagine doing, eg, carpentry in imperial

[23:44] <Animator> Guys, I think it's working well.
[23:44] <Yourself> i'm in grad school now, imperial is still crap
[23:44] <vurtual> you're in school
[23:44] <vurtual> Schools never teach you how to handle real life you know
[23:44] <rbos> clearly
[23:44] <Yourself> lol
[23:44] <vurtual> just numbers and stuff
[23:45] <bildramer> Also, doing any job needing no use of the brain whatsoever (not literally) usually earns you the same as most other jobs where you must actually prove you're not a retard
[23:45] <Serow> Schools prepare you for further schooling.
[23:45] <vurtual> No physics professor ever will tell you how to perfectly cleanly jump over a fence when wind, solar radiation, and billions of random variables are in play.
[23:45] <Serow> Or, in the case of Florida, school prepares you to take the FCAT.

[23:46] <bildramer> well, actually, not
[23:46] <bildramer> they should tell assholes not being assholes gets you money
[23:46] <rbos> physics professors are all white old guys who sit in book-lined studies all day writing on chalkboards
[23:46] <rbos> clearly
[23:46] <bildramer> all together with fake statistics

[23:47] <bildramer> also, what's with racism? usually white people are doing better jobs than blacks even though everyone wants to believe otherwise
[23:47] <vurtual> and no hippie or feminist or review board or crazy person with a wi-fi allergy can tell you how to live.
[23:47] <bildramer> is it hardcoded into the brain or something?
[23:47] <vurtual> rbos, so far it's worked out fine.
[23:47] <IDTL> ITS THE HAPPY HAPPY JOY JOY SONG
[23:47] <bildramer> wi-fi allergy what

[23:48] <vurtual> he wants to just microwave things in peacea nd enjoy the sun okay

[23:48] <vurtual> rbos, PASS thirty?
[23:48] <vurtual> Oh ho ho

[23:58] <Yourself> oh hey, i was pretty damn close
[23:58] <Yourself> and i just eyeballed it
[23:59] <vurtual> Serow, just have a circuit in the bolt
[23:59] <Adam01> cryzed, no idea
[23:59] <vurtual> so when you open the door, it stops sending a DON'T SSS signal
[23:59] <Adam01> I just send every minute
[23:59] <cryzed> Adam01, alright
[23:59] <Kokopure> it will only stop hissing if he beats it to death with a nearby papercraft sword.
