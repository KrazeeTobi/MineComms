[1:34] <Ten_Tacles> It appears that, in some cases, starting out a new world with this in the reaction file can lead to all civilizations being Forgotten Beasts; thus, it may be better to add it after world creation, since Forgotten Beasts cannot work.

[2:10] <AzureAngelic> you werent supposed to answer
[2:10] <AzureAngelic> >:I
[2:10] <Snowman> SimCity2k ftw
[2:10] <bildramer> vede, coooooooooooooooooooooooooool
[2:11] <Snowman> FUCK
[2:11] <Snowman> You made me nostalgia
[2:11] <AzureAngelic> so are there any good game making tools
[2:11] <Snowman> AND NOW I HEAR THE Bzzt SOUND IN MY HEAD
[2:11] <AzureAngelic> all i know of is rpg maker and game maker
[2:11] <bildramer> Keiya, check your hosts file
[2:11] <vede> Oh dang.
[2:11] <Snowman> Gaem Maekr*
[2:11] <bildramer> AzureAngelic: brain, C++ compiler
[2:11] * vede laughs at Snowman covered in all his Nostalgia juices.
[2:12] <bildramer> :l
[2:12] <AzureAngelic> im guessing game maker isnt good to you guys
[2:12] <bildramer> of course not
[2:12] <bildramer> it sucks
[2:12] <bildramer> end.
[2:12] <AzureAngelic> bild i just want to dick around with stuff lol
[2:12] <Snowman> It's pretty good if you're pro at it
[2:12] <AzureAngelic> im not going to go make the next crysis
[2:12] <Snowman> But 99.9% of the games made in it are shit
[2:12] <AzureAngelic> well what did you expect from a free program
[2:12] <Snowman> It's not free
[2:13] <Snowman> The Pro version isn't
[2:13] <vede> AzureAngelic, also, you can't say something is okay because it's expected.

[2:13] <AzureAngelic> i didnt say it was ok
[2:13] <AzureAngelic> just that its not surprising
[2:13] <Visiiri> I say it's OK
[2:13] <bildramer> :l
[2:13] <bildramer> it just sucks
[2:14] <bildramer> it's pretty slow for anything serious
[2:14] <AzureAngelic> i've used rpg maker before
[2:14] <bildramer> only pros can make good games etc.
[2:14] <bildramer> see Iji, almost nothing else
[2:14] <AzureAngelic> it was cool, but i have no idea how to balance rpgs
[2:14] <vede> Spelunky, if you're into that kind of thing.
[2:14] <blaster> Vede I once made a city making game in game maker
[2:14] <bildramer> yes, Spelunky yoo
[2:14] <bildramer> t*
[2:14] <blaster> its not that hard, simulate people as extra objects
[2:14] <Snowman> I once made a game where you walk around and do stuff from the POV like in Pokemon
[2:14] <vede> blaster, from what I've seen, most of your games suck pretty hard.
[2:14] <blaster> and make them travel between buildings
[2:14] <vede> Jussayin'
[2:15] <Snowman> Dunno what that POV is called
[2:15] * Zuriki (Mibbit@89.241.235.101) has joined #minecraft
[2:15] <blaster> It does suck a little
[2:15] <Snowman> Anyway, was pretty lame, but only spent like an hour on it
[2:15] <AzureAngelic> so i just ended up giving everybody a poorly photoshopped image of heavy weapons guy as instant kill attack spells and a googled image of bill cosby as a boss
[2:15] <vede> Snowman, overhead.
[2:15] <vede> That's the term you're looking for, i think.
[2:15] <Zuriki> Anyone remember that IRC style mafia game
[2:15] <Snowman> Ok, never heard of that term being used for pokemon before
[2:15] <bildramer> I made a game where you're a helicopter and bomb stuff
[2:15] <AzureAngelic> itt bild is terrorist
[2:15] <Zuriki> Only it was on it's own site...
[2:15] <bildramer> when I was like 11 I think
[2:15] <vede> Fuck, I didn't capitalize I.
[2:15] <vede> I feel stupid.
[2:15] <Snowman> But isn't overhead more like GTA 1 and 2 and stuff?
[2:16] <vede> Snowman, yes, it is. It's also like Pokemon.
[2:16] <blaster> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=13132 for traincraft download
[2:16] <AzureAngelic> i keep thinking isometric but thats like earthbound or mario rpg
[2:16] <vede> Anything where the player sees the player from above is overhead.
[2:16] <Snowman> Ok, overhead is anything from 45 to 90 degrees above the playing
[2:16] <blaster> 45 degrees is proberbly birdseye view
[2:16] <blaster> and you need object layering for that
[2:16] <blaster> to look right
[2:17] <vede> blaster, usually 90-degrees is bird's-eye.
[2:17] <Keiya> This is so friggin weird
[2:17] <vede> But I think overhead and bird's-eye are pretty much interchangeable.
[2:17] <Keiya> I'm on IRC, I'm playing TF2...

[2:17] <Keiya> but I can't open any new connections, or something
[2:17] <blaster> If a bird looked verticly down it would have to be nose diving
[2:17] <Snowman> Ok, so GTA is bird's-eye, Pokemon is overhead and Tomb Raider is TPS
[2:17] <AzureAngelic> ok there
[2:17] <AzureAngelic> got game maker 8 pro
[2:17] <AzureAngelic> time to fuck around with it
[2:17] <blaster> Can I play portal while it is downloading
[2:18] <blaster> because there is a play button
[2:18] <Snowman> Push it :P
[2:18] <vede> blaster, I know a bird would be nose-diving like that, but that's still generally what the term means.
[2:18] <Snowman> Just anothing box will pop up

[2:20] <Snowman> Oh
[2:20] <blaster> That would be easy to do with reskinned flowers
[2:20] <Snowman> That's overhead iirc

[2:28] <bildramer> um
[2:28] <blaster> excuse me

[2:28] <ZomBuster> every file just has a xy coordinate

[2:29] <blaster> I fixed the leaves and shrubs
[2:29] <ZomBuster> I think
[2:29] <blaster> Zombuster could you make it generate lower detail maps
[2:30] <blaster> like 1 pixel = 16x16
[2:30] <Animator> Bildramer, I don't think there aren't enough u's to stress that out on how huge it would be. It would be huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge.
[2:30] <bildramer> :l
[2:30] <bildramer> I should make an infdev map editor
[2:30] * blaster (heliduels@78.145.172.19) Quit (Quit: Died)

[2:33] <Snowman> I was hoping I was better than you :P
[2:33] <Visiiri> Is there a SOTW thread on the forums?
[2:33] <Kokopure> the only reason I prestiged once is because that opens up a bunch of new callsigns and challenges
[2:33] <Kokopure> as well as gives you an extra modifiable class
[2:34] <EmpiresBane> damn it! i left right as you began talking about it
[2:34] <bildramer> wat
[2:34] <Snowman> You need to prestige 7 times for one callsign
[2:34] <bildramer> epicage
[2:34] <bildramer> also wtf
[2:34] <Kokopure> but I'd have to prestige two more times to get another create-a-class :P
[2:34] <bildramer> it looks blocky
[2:34] <bildramer> uh
[2:34] <bildramer> what the fuck did I just say
[2:34] <Visiiri> I should run a SOTW thread on the forums
[2:34] <bildramer> I mean you can see the edges near some chunks

[2:52] <Snowman> FlyinOvenOfDoom, you know how a dynamo works?
[2:52] <FlyinOvenOfDoom> a what now?
[2:52] <bildramer> um
[2:52] <bildramer> wait what
[2:53] <bildramer> dynamo converts rotation to current or something
[2:53] <Snowman> That thing you have on your bike that generates electricity
[2:53] <bildramer> yep
[2:53] <FlyinOvenOfDoom> oh
[2:53] <bildramer> how the hell would that do AC->DC
[2:53] <bildramer> er
[2:53] <FlyinOvenOfDoom> well if I saw a schematic or picture I'd probably figure it out
[2:53] <bildramer> DC->AC
[2:53] <Snowman> Cause it spins, makes the magnetic field turn
[2:53] <FlyinOvenOfDoom> wasnt it two electromagnets?
[2:53] <Snowman> No, you make a DC electromotor, insert the elecricity into it
[2:54] <Snowman> On the rotating bit of the motor, you put a magnet
[2:54] <blaster> Zombusters infdev map realy works http://i43.tinypic.com/n5raz8.png
[2:54] <Snowman> You put a coil around the rotating magnet
[2:54] <Snowman> You get AC

[3:07] <Snowman> Let's use Lindows
[3:07] <GoaLitiuM> xfce is so compact
[3:07] <blaster> Earlier it was realy slow, so maby they were adding the new fiber optics which temporarily disrupted connection

[3:09] <blaster> Keiya last time I checked rubber banding refers to a decreace in framerate and then a huge increace
[3:09] <GoaLitiuM> Keiya: oh? something like 4 years ago when i tried out KDE, there was no desktop icons
[3:09] <Keiya> It has different meanings in all sorts of things >_>
[3:09] <Mosslander> In videogames it refers to the opponents adjusting to your skill level.

[3:43] <Snowman> Also, lag is connection speed, not low fps

[3:43] <blaster> also looking through portals causes a drop in FPS to about 5
[3:43] <Shadaez> blaster turn shader quality down
[3:43] <blaster> shader is on lowest
[3:44] <blaster> Models on medium
[3:44] <Visiiri> Lag can mean FPS too.
[3:44] <Visiiri> .g define lag
[3:44] <Snowman> blaster, for the looking in portals, lower the funnel amount
[3:44] <Visiiri> 'hang (back) or fall (behind) in movement, progress, development, etc'
[3:44] <blaster> I could go for MUCH HIGHER SETTINGS but i prefer a 1024x768 resolution to 800x600
[3:44] <Shadaez> Visiiri I know, people like to act like lag = internet

[4:17] <vurtual> "excersize room"
[4:17] <vurtual> also woah duck hunt lamp, awesome.

[4:17] <vurtual> duck hunt was awesome

[4:17] <PuyoDead> Shit, I still have two of those Duck Hunt/Super Mario Bros. cartriges under my TV right now.
[4:17] <vurtual> I was such a good shot
[4:17] <vede> They had an NES and board games.

[4:23] <vurtual> 4. trains, wheeeee.
[4:24] <Snowman> Loads of radioactive waste, just to look good

[5:55] <Drakkar> you mean you want straight action
[5:55] <vurtual> Remember the movies where the hero dying wasn't really that much of an acutal threat, you just wondered how many supporting characters were in danger?
[5:56] <vurtual> and wether the hero's gonna kill that guy, or not?
[5:56] <Agarrett> he said he would slow down until june

[7:03] <Mia[busy]> For the past, maybe 8 months I haven't been able to use multiplayer, I've tried asking several people and we couldn't diagnose the issue. Single-player anything worked fine.
[7:03] <Mia[busy]> As of now, single-player isn't working, I'm getting an error with "java.lang.nullPointerException"
[7:03] <Cial> i get that at times
[7:04] <Cial> i just reset the browser/client when it happens
[7:04] <Mia[busy]> I've tried using Chrome, Firefox, and the WoM client and they all do the same thing.
[7:05] <Mia[busy]> The WoM client seems to be outputting some info on it though, hold on
[7:07] <Mia[busy]> http://i43.tinypic.com/29n8mqs.png
[7:07] <Koko|Minecraft> heyyy, that looks complicated!
[7:08] <vede> I'm assuming you've tried updating Java and all that?
[7:08] <vurtual> you know what I find iroinc?
[7:08] <Mia[busy]> Several times.
[7:08] <vede> Or uninstalling and reinstalling Java?
[7:08] <Mia[busy]> Yeah.
[7:08] <vurtual> The US military has little IED-defusing bots, so nobody human has to get blown up
[7:09] <vurtual> yet, their users get depressed just like someone died every time the bot gets blown up

[7:09] <vede> Interesting.

[7:12] <Mia[busy]> Anyway, it gets that far, freezes with a "Failed to start Minecraft: java.lang.NullPointerException" popup, and I wait for a bit, then close it.
[7:12] <vurtual> all we have to do is make them out of explode-proof materials
[7:14] <Mia[busy]> A) I don't think such materials exist, B) something is already going on here.
[7:14] <Animator> First, Mia, no discussion of custom clients here.
[7:14] <Animator> Seccondly, this is a common problem that occurs round these parts.
[7:15] <Mia[busy]> Okay, sorry, I didn't know that. Just trying to diagnose the issue.
[7:15] <Animator> No worries.
[7:15] <Mia[busy]> I haven't played in a while.
[7:15] <Mia[busy]> Mostly because multiplayer wasn't working. Anyway, is there a way to fix it, or..?
[7:15] <Animator> I reccomend the support section of the forums for these kinds of things.
[7:16] * Animator digs up threads of histories past.
[7:17] <Animator> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=4356&hilit=java.lang.NullPointerException Read and see if it helps your case.

[7:58] <vurtual> if they passed
[7:58] <Yourself> <Syerjchep-Azjherben> so should I just google "source sdk"
[7:58] <vurtual> Improvised Explosive Device, Rooster
[7:58] <Yourself> Library tab
[7:58] <Yourself> go to TOOLS sub-tab
[7:58] <Rooster> Yes
[7:59] <Yourself> sorce SDK
[7:59] <vurtual> I'm gonna be incredibly sadistic here.
[7:59] <MuthSera> Alright then.. I was wondering about the noted wisdom behind attempting realistic training on garry's mod.
[7:59] <Rooster> vurtual I was just fucking with you
[7:59] <vurtual> If you walk in a door haphazardly, it blows up.
[7:59] <Yourself> also get the source sdk base
[7:59] <vurtual> if you MAKE SOUND, it blows up
[7:59] <vurtual> if you go naer the bomb, it blows up.
[7:59] <MuthSera> So this called for you making many angry faces at them?
[7:59] <vurtual> infact you can't defuse it
[7:59] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> okay
[8:00] <MuthSera> Anyways..
[8:00] <MuthSera> I had such an interesting time with indev mode. :D I was wondering if anybody else had this paticular experiance with it.. xD;
[8:01] <Rooster> Indev > Infdev
[8:01] <MuthSera> My friend dropped me into indev mode with no discussion about what takes place. Gave me a link to the crafting wiki and told me to have fun..
[8:01] <MuthSera> ATM I go back and forth on that, Rooster.
[8:01] <MuthSera> Anyways..
[8:01] <MuthSera> The first thing I did.. was chase some sheep.. shop a bit of wood.. drilled 3x2 squares into the side of a stone wall and then hit I for inventory, then went to the wiki thinking my game was paused.
[8:02] <MuthSera> chop*
[8:02] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> Wow, I can't find a link.
[8:02] <MuthSera> So.. I read on crafting for about 5 minutes, come back, and it's night time.
[8:02] <MuthSera> It's like.. super dark.
[8:02] <MuthSera> I can't see shit. Period. I am like.. ooooooooooh wtf. O_O
[8:02] <MuthSera> So I hide in my super tiny cave.. and eventually I hear footsteps outside my cave.
[8:02] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> torches dude
[8:02] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> torches
[8:02] <MuthSera> It's a skeleton.. although I don't know it at the time.
[8:02] <MuthSera> Yeah.
[8:02] <vurtual> woah, some random guy tried to jin my game
[8:02] <MuthSera> I diddn't know how to craft ANYTHING.
[8:02] <Rooster> Lol
[8:03] <MuthSera> Or even that I would be attacked at night.
[8:03] <MuthSera> So..
[8:03] <MuthSera> Long story short, skeleton kills me..
[8:03] <MuthSera> I spawn out in a lake. Swim to shore..
[8:03] <MuthSera> Still cannot see ANYTHING
[8:03] <MuthSera> And then all I hear is a fuse..
[8:03] <MuthSera> And then see a glowing outline.
[8:03] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> lulz
[8:03] <MuthSera> Rofldead.
[8:03] <MuthSera> So..

[8:04] <MuthSera> I remake my game.. and this time what I do is I drilll straight into the side of a dirt hill, build a small viewport to see when the sun comes up, and I wait the night out.
[8:04] <MuthSera> A creeper drops down in front of my viewport and I sit there still as a mouse cause I'm afraid that the AI will glitch and he'll pop inside somehow like is common in so many other games.

[8:04] <MuthSera> I go up and poke it unknowingly, and it explodes, blowing my pillow fort to bits.
[8:05] <MuthSera> Luckily, it did not kill me, and I rebuilt.. But I actually was so panicked by the exploding zombies + paranoia and having to hide in my little tiny fort that I was histarically laughing.
[8:05] <MuthSera> :c Although once I figured the game out alot of the nervousness went away.
[8:06] <vurtual> creepers
[8:06] <MuthSera> And thats my story. :C This game is a serious nubkiller.
[8:06] <vurtual> ssssssssssss
[8:06] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> dur
[8:06] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> it's called peaceful mode

[8:06] <MuthSera> I didn't know about any of that. xD;
[8:06] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> dur
[8:06] <Syerjchep-Azjherben> it's called cheat engine

[8:07] <TKGP_DS> Scrubs is for scrubs >:(
[8:08] <Dommys> Muth, the problem was the "Dirt" fort.
[8:08] <Dommys> Dirt is extra splodey :D
[8:08] <MuthSera> xD I diddn't know how to make tools.
[8:08] <MuthSera> For the longest time I didn't know I could even make tools out of wood.
[8:08] <MuthSera> I just thought cobblestone was a super rare drop.
[8:08] <Dommys> Just sayin' if you're gonna live in dirt, gotta make them walls pretty damned thick :D
[8:09] <MuthSera> The game needs an elevating difficulty curve. :P
[8:09] <MuthSera> Once you secure your paremeter it's pretty straightforward from there.
[8:09] <Dommys> HFS, when you hit the bottom layer, demons swarm!

[8:21] <MuthSera> Quite a few.
[8:21] <TKGP_DS> well, sure
[8:21] <MuthSera> Hmm... Finite water is behaving so... strangely.
[8:21] <TKGP_DS> in or inf?
[8:21] <MuthSera> in.
[8:21] <MuthSera> both
[8:21] <MuthSera> actually
[8:21] <TKGP_DS> well
[8:22] <vurtual> I just noticed Garry's Mod will light up an entity in a player flashlight
[8:22] <TKGP_DS> doesn't flow in inf
[8:22] <MuthSera> sometimes it won't flow.. or roughly 200 squares of water will flow and fit into a 1x1 square..
[8:22] <TKGP_DS> has a tendency to delete itself in in
[8:22] <MuthSera> I noticed that actually.
[8:22] <MuthSera> And in creative mode it just.. massively replicates?
[8:23] <TKGP_DS> infinite in creative
[8:23] <MuthSera> Yeah.
[8:23] <MuthSera> Dorf Fortress handled water startlingly well considering..
[8:23] <TKGP_DS> mm
[8:23] <MuthSera> the 1/7 water thing was quite nice. :P

[8:25] <MuthSera> I was right on the side of a cliff, of a looong and very very tall ridge. And on top of this ridge, a river ran along it.
[8:26] <MuthSera> Which is exceptionally strange, from a geographical standpoint, but whatever.
[8:26] <TKGP_DS> drain river, build dam, etc
[8:26] <MuthSera> So anyways. I ran a spiral up from the side of the cliff to the river..
[8:26] <MuthSera> And caused it to exit right above the entrance to my dorf house.. and flow along either side of it, and then down the cliff.
[8:26] <MuthSera> Which it did. :P
[8:27] <MuthSera> After about 4 hours of playing, I'd flooded pretty much the entire lower area.
[8:27] <MuthSera> heh. ^-^ I love how the game keeps track of things like "how much water is really here?" And it's water pressure.. ect..
[8:28] <TKGP_DS> DF has a good soundtrack

[8:52] <TKGP_DS_Coding> so, in a 50x50 field with one 3x3 building, how many trees should there be?
[8:52] <TheClassiestMedic> depends
[8:52] <MuthSera> 2500.
[8:52] <TheClassiestMedic> What's the depth
[8:53] <TKGP_DS_Coding> uh, what now? just generic 50 tiles by 50 tiles. trees take up 1 tile
[8:53] <MuthSera> Anyways. I say... ummm..
[8:53] <MuthSera> In the case of them being the size, of say... those in minecraft..
[8:53] <MuthSera> 1 for every 5x5 area..
[8:53] <MuthSera> So..
[8:53] <MuthSera> 2500 /25 = your awnser
[8:53] <MuthSera> For a densely forested area.
[8:53] <MuthSera> so.. 100.
[8:53] <TKGP_DS_Coding> no, they're just one tile
[8:53] <MuthSera> oh.
[8:54] <MuthSera> Then that depends on how densely you want your area forested. :P
[8:54] <TKGP_DS_Coding> dunno lol
[8:54] <MuthSera> umm..
[8:54] <MuthSera> try..
[8:54] <MuthSera> 800.
[8:54] <MuthSera> :P
[8:54] <TKGP_DS_Coding> ok
[8:54] <TKGP_DS_Coding> +/- how much?
[8:54] <TKGP_DS_Coding> potentially
[8:54] <MuthSera> Oh.
[8:55] <MuthSera> 900 +/- 100
[8:55] <TKGP_DS_Coding> so, could be 1000? :o
[8:55] <MuthSera> could be.
[8:55] <TKGP_DS_Coding> mmk, you got it

[8:59] <MuthSera> Or like watching defcon..
[8:59] <MuthSera> only less depressing.

[9:02] <Rooster> I've realized not all furries are porn-obsessed addicts
[9:02] <Rooster> via TVtropes
[9:02] <vurtual> Rooster, only just now?
[9:02] <Naxza> Mm, orgestra.
[9:02] <MuthSera> I'm a furry.
[9:02] <MuthSera> Or was.
[9:02] <Rooster> I was un-educated
[9:02] <Rooster> I HAVE BEEN
[9:02] <vurtual> did you actually read the furry article on rooster?

[9:06] <Naxza> Uncoolness?
[9:06] <vurtual> I'm questioning someone on wether or not they'd fit in with a group of people
[9:07] <vurtual> so I'm asking them seemingly random questions about random things
[9:07] <TKGP_DS_Coding> man, fuck this old-ass IDE

[9:07] <MuthSera> www.4chan.org
[9:07] <MuthSera> have a nice internet.
[9:07] <vurtual> no
[9:08] <vurtual> 4chan is one of the right answers
[9:08] <vurtual> do not even begin to question why
[9:08] <vurtual> or you'll go mad from knowing it
[9:08] <Naxza> There are no right answers, there are biased ones.
[9:08] <vurtual> this is entirely psychological examinatino
[9:08] <MuthSera> No. 4chan is a cancerous writhing mass.. slowly shriveling like a raising in the sun.
[9:08] <MuthSera> raisen*
[9:08] <vurtual> raisin.
[9:08] <MuthSera> whatever. I cannot spell anymore.
[9:08] <MuthSera> Thank you.
[9:09] <vurtual> The 2 "correct" answers are SA, and 4chan. The third is wrong.
[9:09] <Cial> SA?
[9:09] <vurtual> Something Awful
[9:09] <MuthSera> somethingawful.
[9:09] <Cial> oh
[9:09] <Cial> ok
[9:09] <vurtual> basically, between them, fits about 75-80% of the incrowd of the group.
[9:09] <Naxza> And that makes them uncool?
[9:10] <vurtual> those are the "right" choices for this.
[9:10] <Naxza> I'm not following.
[9:10] <vurtual> the "wrong" choice is going to be whichever forum or community or whatever I can find that wouldn't fit in.
[9:11] <Naxza> A psychological analysis that has nothing to do with psychology and more with personal preference.
[9:11] <MuthSera> What a chunky vomit milkshake.
[9:11] <MuthSera> ../b/ used to be one's cool secret place to be an internet badass and be an uncouth particle of lake scum.. but now it's EVERYONE's such place.. and we have internet super heros going on about "4chan! we're about.. not forgiving and stuff. Yeah!" And talking about /b/ in real life. e_e
[9:11] <vurtual> Do not question my methods
[9:11] <vurtual> the other one was "throw them in, see if they survive", and people die from that.
[9:11] <MuthSera> Makes me want to pull forward their collars and just vomit down their shirts. e_e
[9:12] <Naxza> Screw questioning anything. It's midnight and my caffeine and sugar high are ending rapidly.

[9:12] <Naxza> You remind me of this guy in another chatroom this morning that tried convincing me that a foot-tall robot that could reassemble itself after being toed apart would bring about the next world war.
[9:13] <vurtual> John Connor?
[9:13] <EmpiresBane> toed apart?
[9:13] <vurtual> COME WITH ME IF YO WANT TO LIVE, NAXZA
[9:13] <Naxza> There was an argument. The robot was supposedly kicked apart, if you can call a swinging foot at half-walking speed a kick.
[9:13] <vurtual> they'd bring about a world war on the internet
[9:13] <vurtual> what would you do with it first
[9:14] <Naxza> Did I mention the thing took seven minutes to reassemble?

[9:16] <vurtual> THEY HAVE SHIELDS
[9:16] <EmpiresBane> what kind of shields blocks EMP's?
[9:16] <vurtual> shields that distort spacetime
[9:17] <Cial> what the hell are they Replicators from Stargate?
[9:17] <vurtual> they are borg
[9:17] <vurtual> resistance is futile
[9:17] <Cial> fuck the borg
[9:17] <vurtual> in retrospect, why CAN'T they EMP the borg?
[9:17] <vurtual> I mean really
[9:17] <vurtual> hammer their shields until they have a weak point, fire EMP like mad
[9:17] <vurtual> until everything turns off
[9:17] * Cial gives vurtual a ticked to a Startreck convention
[9:18] <Cial> ask them
[9:18] <Cial> if they dont lynch you let us know why
[9:19] <Naxza> I think there's a Youtube video that sorta explains the Borg problem.
[9:19] <EmpiresBane> they should have just thrown a spaceship COMPLETLY packed with nuclear weapons right into it
[9:19] <Dommys> They should've just stopped making that show.
[9:19] <MuthSera> anyways, back.
[9:20] <MuthSera> And individual borg have sheilds.

[9:23] <Dommys> lol..everyone watching it? :D
[9:23] <Dommys> Got real quiet in here :D
[9:24] <MuthSera> watching the first one.
[9:24] <Naxza> I'm trying to manage Dwarf Fortress and stay awake at the same time.
[9:24] <Naxza> While witnessing an argument over the internet about nothing that's really an argument over something.
[9:25] <vurtual> You know what'd be ironic.
[9:25] <vurtual> if a game had bullet time
[9:25] <MuthSera> watching the second..
[9:25] <vurtual> but the player's actions didn't go faster, so you still had fast bullets
[9:25] <MuthSera> wtf..
[9:25] <MuthSera> o.O
[9:25] <vurtual> so you desperately try to move out of the way of an object moving many times faster than you.
[9:26] <MuthSera> dommy: Your video makes me hate you.
[9:26] <EmpiresBane> so you saw everything in slow motion?
[9:26] <MuthSera> Vurtual: You'd still have a better chance to get out of the way.
[9:26] <EmpiresBane> ...
[9:27] <MuthSera> However slim.
[9:27] <Dommys> Why muth?
[9:27] <EmpiresBane> you would have a better chance to see them befor ethey shoot
[9:27] <Dommys> I don't understand
[9:27] <EmpiresBane> once they've shot... you're pretty much done
[9:27] <MuthSera> Because although you move no faster, theres no way for the game to impair your increased reaction time, which is, increased via reletivity. :P
[9:28] <Dommys> "[01:26] <MuthSera> dommy: Your video makes me hate you."
[9:28] <Naxza> It's a game. You'd be able to suck some twenty or so bullets down before you die anyways.
[9:28] <MuthSera> Dommy: Because it was like having my ear cannal raped. Only instead of normal non-consensual intercourse, he has a fetish for wearing a sandpaper condom.
[9:29] <Dommys> oh pshh.. that song is awesome.
[9:29] <MuthSera> I hope you burn in a pit of cobras.
[9:29] <EmpiresBane> no
[9:29] <EmpiresBane> it sucks
[9:29] <vurtual> I have coded an interrupt more important than the system clock
[9:29] <vurtual> A millisecond passed? Sorry, that'll have to wait, sir.

[10:19] <Yourself> i can't do that, since i don't have a list
[10:19] <TKGP_DS_Coding> not you, anyone
[10:19] <TKGP_DS_Coding> sigh
[10:20] <TKGP_DS_Coding> fine, I'll just use 3 for now
[10:20] <TKGP_DS_Coding> whatever that is
[10:21] <Yourself> you're not being specific enough for me to help
[10:21] <Yourself> i don't know what you're doing
[10:22] <TKGP_DS_Coding> I'm trying to setcolor(); to light brown
[10:22] <TKGP_DS_Coding> using graphics.h
[10:22] <Yourself> graphics.h isn't a standard C++ header
[10:22] <TKGP_DS_Coding> which is, granted, variable between versions
[10:22] <TKGP_DS_Coding> yes, I know
[10:22] <Yourself> it's an ancient C header for doing DOS graphics
[10:22] <TKGP_DS_Coding> yep
[10:22] <Yourself> http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~main/bgi/doc/setcolor.html
[10:23] <TKGP_DS_Coding> it works in C++

[10:23] <Annihilator> there's only brown on that list
[10:23] <TKGP_DS_Coding> how many colors are there?
[10:24] <Yourself> 16, apparently
[10:24] <TKGP_DS_Coding> perfect
[10:24] <Annihilator> 0 thru 15
[10:24] <TKGP_DS_Coding> well, what's brown?

[10:26] <TKGP_DS_Coding> I'm just a simple first year CS student
[10:26] <Speljohan_> mk TKGP_DS_Coding
[10:26] <Speljohan_> i was just curious
[10:26] <Speljohan_> :P
[10:26] <TKGP_DS_Coding> using a terribly antiquated compiler at school
[10:26] <TKGP_DS_Coding> and no compiler at home T-T
[10:27] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:27] <Yourself> not hard to get a compiler
[10:27] <Yourself> especially one that isn't from the 90s
[10:27] <Speljohan_> CS didn't teach me anything whatsoever when i went to college :(
[10:27] <TKGP_DS_Coding> well, I'd use VStudio
[10:27] <TKGP_DS_Coding> but you need internet connection to install it

[10:32] <TKGP_DS_Coding> sigh
[10:33] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:33] <vede> I wonder how they figure out the transliterations of old, dead languages like that.
[10:33] <Yourself> if you're not using function or operator overloading, classes, or templates, i can't really see why you'd use C++ and not C
[10:33] <Speljohan_> in soviet russia classes count programmers!
[10:33] <Yourself> because at that point you are using C
[10:34] <Speljohan_> pretty much yeh
[10:34] <TKGP_DS_Coding> blrgh
[10:34] <Speljohan_> c++0x looks amazing btw Yourself
[10:34] <TKGP_DS_Coding> we just haven't gotten into that stuff yet
[10:34] <Speljohan_> Variadic templates!!!
[10:34] <Speljohan_> :D
[10:34] <Yourself> yeah, i can't wait
[10:35] <Yourself> i've been watching it for over a year
[10:35] <TKGP_DS_Coding> we did the first 3 quarters on Turbo Pascal 7
[10:35] <Yourself> some people watch sports
[10:35] <Roadcrosser> in soviet russia you play off keyboard cat!
[10:35] <Speljohan_> yeah, it's about time c++ gets an update/overhaul Yourself
[10:35] <Yourself> i watch the development of language standards
[10:35] <TKGP_DS_Coding> only ~4 weeks of c++ so far
[10:35] <Yourself> the auto keyword is a long overdue addition
[10:35] <Yourself> and lambdas
[10:35] <Yourself> and everything really
[10:36] <Yourself> the standard library is getting regular expressions
[10:36] <Yourself> finally
[10:36] <Yourself> also an unordered mapping type last i checked
[10:36] <AotC> lawl, i've had all these things for ages
[10:36] <vede> I mean, I doubt there's anyone alive today who learned those languages from their parents, and I don't quite see how you can write the sounds of letters without using those characters or other characters, which would be just as old as those.

[10:38] <Yourself> "excessively verbose" comes to mind
[10:39] <Speljohan_> it's because microsoft wrote it to compete with java because they got butthurt after losing the java-licensing battle Yourself
[10:39] <Speljohan_> :>
[10:39] <Yourself> what an awful idea
[10:39] <TKGP_DS> C# is more web-oriented, correct?
[10:39] <Speljohan_> not really
[10:39] <Speljohan_> however
[10:39] <TKGP_DS> oh
[10:39] <Speljohan_> at first i thought .net was really really really really really bad
[10:40] <TKGP_DS> I wonder where I got that idea from :x
[10:40] <Speljohan_> but then i realized i saw it as a programming language and not as a microsoft product
[10:40] <Speljohan_> when i saw it as a microsoft product it all made sense
[10:40] <Speljohan_> net framework 1.0 and 1.1 sucked

[10:44] <Marach-17> --
[10:44] <Yourself> oh, another thing i like about the C++0x standard is the extern keyword
[10:44] <Marach-17> wasn't extern there before?
[10:44] <wikkit> I was pretty sure you would know what I was referring to with this being a minecraft IRC.
[10:44] <darkedone02> hmm...
[10:45] <darkedone02> i was looking for a game, similar to spore with life and terraforming.
[10:45] <wikkit> on a more important note
[10:45] <Yourself> yeah, but it's use is slightly different now
[10:45] <wikkit> Pok??mon!
[10:45] <Marach-17> darkedone02: worms armageddon
[10:46] <Yourself> when using templates, especially with respect to metaprogramming techniques, you could run into an annoying error if you split implementation into a .cpp file rather than keeping something entirely in a header file
[10:46] <darkedone02> lol
[10:46] * Annihilator (Annihilato@bas2-toronto48-1279609748.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[10:46] <wikkit> not sure on the terra forming aspect but, There is a program that shows evolution
[10:46] <Marach-17> or if you want 3d, Scorched 3D :D
[10:46] <darkedone02> worm kinda remind me of cortex command with lots of uber mods in a way.
[10:46] <Speljohan_> i'm not a c++ programmer really, so i wouldn't know Yourself
[10:46] <Yourself> now it's not good to have everything as header file only because then everything has to be recompiled if a small change is made
[10:46] <wikkit> it creates randomly shaped creatures
[10:46] <wikkit> that slowly grow and evolve
[10:46] <wikkit> to move move efficiently
[10:46] <Marach-17> i wish i wasn't so good in worms that i could play with nwecomers.
[10:46] <Speljohan_> so i have obviously not found myself a code convention standard for it :P
[10:46] <Yourself> if you split implementation off somewhere else, you can essentially block of portions of code that only need to be recompiled if their interface is changed
[10:47] <Marach-17> this game has only noobs and pro left
[10:47] <Yourself> and compile times are a bitch on large projects
[10:47] * wikkit (Mibbit@c-24-98-144-61.hsd1.ga.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[10:47] <Speljohan_> in c++ yeah Yourself
[10:47] <Speljohan_> the compilers can be really fucking slow
[10:47] <Yourself> Speljohan_, it gets worse when you use a lot of templates
[10:47] <Speljohan_> oh?
[10:47] <Yourself> template metaprogramming shifts runtime slowness to compile-time slowness
[10:47] <Speljohan_> the java compiler is incredibly fast lol
[10:48] <Yourself> teh template mechanism is powerful enough that you can do a lot of computational work using it
[10:48] <Speljohan_> yeah
[10:48] <Yourself> and in some of the projects i've worked on, run-time efficiency is very important
[10:48] <Yourself> so we take advantage of the template stuff
[10:48] <Speljohan_> of course
[10:48] <vurtual> I wonder what would result if Notch had a voting contest for mobs.
[10:48] <Yourself> but, like i mentioned, you run into linking issues
[10:48] <Marach-17> rana would win
[10:49] <Yourself> because a particular header file is seen by the compiler in two places
[10:49] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:49] <vurtual> Like, people submit mobs to a massive poll, and then those which are voted for enough will be tried out.
[10:49] <Speljohan_> make smarter compilers!!
[10:49] <Yourself> a main source file includes it so it can link to the actual object file
[10:49] <Yourself> well, that's what the standard does
[10:49] <vurtual> Then we'd have all sorts of crazy things.
[10:49] <Yourself> and it's not because the header is in two places
[10:49] <Yourself> but because a symbol defined in the header in the two places is different
[10:49] <Yourself> because the symbol is based on a template
[10:50] <Yourself> there is a way around this, but it's really a hack
[10:50] <Yourself> and i can never remember what it is
[10:50] <Yourself> anyway, the extern keyword will avoid the whole issue in the new standard
[10:51] <Yourself> they redesigned it to specifically deal with that
[10:51] <Speljohan_> hmmmmmmm
[10:51] <Speljohan_> should i use a custom format or just serialize the damn GameWorld class for my smb game??
[10:51] <Speljohan_> i feel like being lazy
[10:51] <Speljohan_> so it's leaning towards serialization
[10:51] * TKGP (josephande@24.40.206.164) has joined #minecraft
[10:51] <Yourself> depends on how much you think users will want to edit it
[10:51] <TKGP> yay internet!
[10:51] <Yourself> and then it depends on how much you hate them
[10:52] <Speljohan_> published maps won't be edited Yourself
[10:52] <Marach-17> portal is weird.
[10:52] <Marach-17> after decompiling a map
[10:52] <Yourself> but will people still want to make their own maps?
[10:52] <Roadcrosser> huh
[10:52] <Marach-17> i see that a portal gun grows out of a player's ass
[10:52] <Speljohan_> yes, and it does have a map editor Yourself
[10:52] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:52] <Yourself> well if it has a map editor, it really doesn't matter
[10:52] <Speljohan_> except for
[10:52] <Roadcrosser> hey
[10:52] <Speljohan_> file size
[10:52] <Roadcrosser> Iknow
[10:52] <Speljohan_> which is usually trivial
[10:52] <Roadcrosser> minecraft in portal
[10:52] <Yourself> i was going to point out minecraft of an example of why you don't want to use the serialize shit
[10:53] <Speljohan_> haha
[10:53] <Yourself> i actually went and worked out what all of it meant using the standard
[10:53] <Yourself> it's a god-awful nightmare
[10:53] <Roadcrosser> and chell can witch between gunand meelee
[10:53] <Speljohan_> i usually write my own format to minimize file-sizes and give a standard to the users
[10:53] <Roadcrosser> portal guns kill mobs...
[10:53] <Speljohan_> with documentation on the file format
[10:53] <Yourself> that's generally better
[10:53] <Speljohan_> in case someone wants to make their own 3rd party tools
[10:54] <Yourself> that's the route i like to go

[10:55] <Speljohan_> there's the editor

[10:55] <Marach-17> TKGP: one file?
[10:55] <TKGP> yes
[10:56] <Speljohan_> first opengl project i ever did, about 2 days of work put into it Yourself lol

[10:59] <TKGP> oh
[10:59] <TKGP> not in the version I've been using
[10:59] <TKGP> :x
[10:59] <Marach-17> then it isn't compatible with standards
[10:59] <Speljohan_> Roadcrosser it isn't completed yet
[10:59] <Roadcrosser> oh
[10:59] <Speljohan_> still has bugs
[10:59] <TKGP> it's a really old version
[10:59] <Speljohan_> and missing features
[11:00] <Speljohan_> i have yet to complete it etc
[11:00] <TKGP> never mind then, I'll just compile it at school
[11:00] <Marach-17> just get codeblocks+mingw or something
[11:00] <Roadcrosser> also youre not suppose to label ? blocks as mushroom
[11:00] <Roadcrosser> but flower
[11:00] <TKGP> no idea what that is. an IDE, I'm guessing?

[11:06] <Speljohan_> i'm going to write map file format now then Yourself
[11:06] <Speljohan_> because i have a few plans now
[11:06] <Speljohan_> lol
[11:06] <Speljohan_> 1. make map loading/saving
[11:06] <Speljohan_> 2. add an overworld mode + support for editing it using editor
[11:07] <Azathoth> oooh
[11:07] <Azathoth> the overworld should look pretty cool
[11:07] <Yourself> <Speljohan_> someone definately has Yourself
[11:07] <Yourself> a cursory glance suggests this is so, but when i actually dig for it, i'm 404'd
[11:07] <Speljohan_> heh
[11:07] <Azathoth> SVG?
[11:08] <Yourself> SVG
[11:08] <Azathoth> *sigh* ok i'll just look it up
[11:09] <Marach-17> can't wait to see speljohan_'s finished game
[11:09] <Speljohan_> hmm, time to optimize optimize optimize optimize!
[11:09] <Marach-17> am i in credits? :D
[11:09] <Yourself> there's a lot of shit for SVG output

[11:09] <Yourself> i don't want output
[11:09] <Yourself> output is trivial
[11:09] <Speljohan_> adding collidable flag to the entity classes to prevent unnecessesary collision detection
[11:10] <Speljohan_> i don't think 100 static blocks need to keep track of their location and wether they are colliding with something or not
[11:10] <Speljohan_> lol
[11:10] <Yourself> probably not
[11:10] <Azathoth> or you could just do a distance check
[11:10] <Yourself> use a quadtree lololololololololol
[11:10] <Speljohan_> these blocks are right next to eachother in many cases Azathoth
[11:10] <Speljohan_> lol, overkill Yourself
[11:10] <TKGP> something something A*
[11:10] <Yourself> yeah, it is
[11:11] <Yourself> i just like them because they look really cool when you use them to discretize an arbitrary domain
[11:11] <Speljohan_> i should totally have pathfinding mobs

[11:11] <Speljohan_> evil flying goomba
[11:11] <Azathoth> pathfinding in mario
[11:11] <Speljohan_> pathfinding his way to u!
[11:11] <Azathoth> walk until an edge is reached, turn around
[11:11] <Speljohan_> loll
[11:11] <Speljohan_> that's exactly what i do right now
[11:11] <Yourself> looks like i'm learning the svg format
[11:11] <Speljohan_> velocity.x = -velocity.x
[11:11] <Yourself> or, rather, the tags it uses
[11:11] <Speljohan_> :D
[11:11] <Yourself> since it's XML
[11:12] <Azathoth> hell, even if they were able to navigate more effectively, i think A* would be overkill anyway

[11:12] <TKGP> I was just joking >_>
[11:12] <Azathoth> :P
[11:13] <Azathoth> so i have a question that maybe one of you could help me with
[11:13] <Speljohan_> i wouldn't even need A* to make the mob follow player
[11:13] <Speljohan_> just walk towards him, if collision happens, jump and go left
[11:13] <Azathoth> i have a grid of tiles and i'd like to split it into rectangular groupings of tiles
[11:14] <Speljohan_> if there's a gap, jump over it
[11:14] <Azathoth> or specifically i'd like to group all of a specific tile type into as few large rectangles as possible
[11:14] <Azathoth> any ideas for algorithms to use?
[11:15] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.66.62) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[11:15] <Yourself> not exactly a trivial problem
[11:15] <Azathoth> i realize this
[11:16] <TKGP> wee, Codeblocks for mac
[11:16] * Moocmans-Alt (Max_Bo@140.a.001.gld.iprimus.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[11:16] <Azathoth> well it doesn't have to come up with the best possible solution, just a good one
[11:16] <Yourself> well, finding a contiguous region of one block type isn't difficult
[11:16] <Azathoth> and it doesn't have to be super efficient as it will happen only on loading and will be over a small area
[11:17] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.66.62) has joined #minecraft
[11:17] <Yourself> so the problem at least reduces to decomposing a polygon into a minimum number of disjoint rectangular primitices
[11:17] <Yourself> primitives
[11:17] * Moocmans-Alt (Max_Bo@140.a.001.gld.iprimus.net.au) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[11:17] <Azathoth> hmm
[11:17] <Azathoth> in fact
[11:17] <Azathoth> that almost sounds like BSP
[11:18] <Azathoth> my main requirement is that the segments be convex, but if we're using square tiles, convex = rectangular anyway
[11:18] <Yourself> a BSP would work but it'd be difficult to make it actually optimal
[11:19] <Azathoth> it doesn't need to be super optimal. i just need to end up with a smaller set of rectangles than one for every tile
[11:19] <Yourself> then use a BSP
[11:19] <Marach-17> lolbsp
[11:19] <Yourself> pick the interfaces between tile types as splitting planes
[11:19] * JCS^ (jcs@201-43-203-11.dsl.telesp.net.br) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

[11:20] * TKGP (josephande@24.40.206.164) Quit (Quit: TKGP)
[11:20] <Yourself> like pick splitting planes that split as close to the median coordinate as possible
[11:20] <Yourself> so you get a balanced tree
[11:20] <Azathoth> would BSP work with unconnected areas?
[11:21] <Speljohan_> fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff fatal flaw in my design
[11:21] <Speljohan_> :cry:
[11:21] <Speljohan_> brb rewriting..
[11:21] <Yourself> Azathoth, "no tile" is a kind of tile
[11:21] * Rils (Hunter@75.15.121.59) has joined #minecraft
[11:21] <Yourself> so you shouldn't have disconnected areas

[11:22] <Azathoth> or do i nerm
[11:22] <Azathoth> ah
[11:22] <Azathoth> forgot to erase before typing erm*
[11:22] <Yourself> so basically given a set of tiles, determine a set of splitting planes
[11:23] <Yourself> pick the one nearest to the median in the appropriate coordinate
[11:23] <Azathoth> well for my purposes i want to ignore everything but solid tiles, so they're basically empty space
[11:23] <Yourself> maybe you could see how many continguous regions a plane splits
[11:23] <Yourself> and use that to rank them
[11:24] <Yourself> so that you split first on planes that split the fewest solid regions
[11:24] <Yourself> the median would be easier, though
[11:24] <Yourself> then recurse
[11:25] <Azathoth> wait. what would i use as edges?
[11:25] <Azathoth> if i just used the tile edges, the algorithm would just want to split everything up into individual tiles anyway, wouldn't it?

[11:25] <Azathoth> oh, right
[11:26] <Azathoth> ><
[11:26] <Azathoth> i'm not very familiar with bsp, and the only implementation i've seen is in 3D
[11:26] <Yourself> it'll take a lot of experimentation to pick a good splitting criterion
[11:26] <Roadcrosser> Speljohan_ dont forget the ? block that raises a vine for mario to climb on
[11:26] <Yourself> even if it splits too much it'll be faster than a linear search
[11:26] <Roadcrosser> also get teh pipes done
[11:27] <Azathoth> roadcrosser, he's going to remake the game levels too, so it would be hard for him to forget any features :P
[11:27] <Yourself> since now collision detection just becomes a matter of traversing the tree
[11:27] <Roadcrosser> pipes should just be invisible markers and when mario presses down on them he gets transported
[11:27] <Speljohan_> that system will be pretty rudimentary at first
[11:27] <Azathoth> i wasn't planning on using it for collision detection though
[11:27] <Roadcrosser> that way the code doesnt need to worry about visuals
[11:27] <Speljohan_> i intend to implement lua scripting or sumthin for the whole thing later though
[11:28] * TheAltair (GMNebel@207.98.247.133) has joined #minecraft
[11:28] <Roadcrosser> agree anyone?
[11:28] <Azathoth> my collision detection with the environment is simpler than that and just checks the tile array for collisions
[11:28] <Azathoth> i'm using this to create convex hulls for my lighting system
[11:28] <vurtual> I keep hearing this one sound, it is literally driving me isnane.

[11:29] <vurtual> It's appeared in some show on HGTV during a random panning, and in modern marvels just now, in the episode involving a giant tire, among other times.
[11:29] <Azathoth> that looks about like what i need
[11:29] <Yourself> Roadcrosser, why would you need anything separate from the pipe itself?
[11:29] <Roadcrosser> well
[11:30] <Azathoth> do you just have some huge collection of papers on all sorts of random topics?
[11:30] <Visiiri> AC2 is a pretty good game.
[11:30] <Roadcrosser> making a pipe with a built in teleporter would be tedious to place AND code
[11:30] <Visiiri> I like the large amount of historically accurate content.
[11:30] <Speljohan_> uhh what
[11:30] <Speljohan_> it wouldn't Roadcrosser
[11:30] <Speljohan_> lol
[11:30] <Yourself> Azathoth, coincidentally i was reading this earlier today
[11:30] <Azathoth> hah
[11:30] <Roadcrosser> as the player would have to worry about teh height of teh pipe
[11:30] <Yourself> but i read a lot
[11:30] <Roadcrosser> and stuff
[11:30] <Azathoth> AC2, visiiri?
[11:30] <Speljohan_> no Roadcrosser

[11:31] <Speljohan_> bam done
[11:31] <Roadcrosser> what about invisible pipes
[11:31] <Roadcrosser> id want those
[11:31] <Visiiri> And it's finally time to actually be able to fight with your hidden blade.
[11:31] <Azathoth> vurtual i have a similar thing
[11:31] <Speljohan_> yes, but i'm not adding that until i get a lua scripting system underway Roadcrosser
[11:31] <vurtual> It isn't the amen break either.
[11:31] <Visiiri> Althought I was saddened when his finger wasn't cut off, as that's an important symbol/theme in the plot line of the original game.
[11:31] <Roadcrosser> eh I cant code in lua
[11:31] <Azathoth> any time in a movie when there's a scene involving police responding at the scene of a crime or something
[11:31] <Roadcrosser> whatever
[11:31] <Speljohan_> anyone can use lua
[11:31] <Speljohan_> it's ridiculously simple
[11:32] <Azathoth> there's this one radio chatter clip that plays at the beginning of any such scene
[11:32] <Azathoth> visiiri, me too :(
[11:32] <Yourself> lua is pretty similar to python
[11:33] <Visiiri> If you're concerned with easy, Roadcrosser, learn some AutoHotKey
[11:33] <Visiiri> it takes seconds to code great or useful things.
[11:33] <Visiiri> However, it doesn't have good functionality.
[11:33] <vurtual> There should be a database of these things.
[11:33] <Roadcrosser> ...
[11:33] <Visiiri> It's simply client sided- anything that you can input, it can do simply.
[11:33] <Yourself> OO in lua seems a little bizarre, though
[11:34] <Visiiri> Clicking, typing, forming INIs, calculating, etc.
[11:34] <Visiiri> But if you're looking for something with brawn and no brain, I think that Python is the way to go.

[11:38] <Visiiri> Python covers quite a bit of everything, and is relatively simple.
[11:38] <Visiiri> But it lacks the power of C++ or C#.
[11:39] <Visiiri> Learn some simple things like Lua, AHK, or even Expression 2 in Garrys Mod. If you're intellegent enough, you will build connections and coding gets easier.
[11:39] <Yourself> alright, enough is enough
[11:40] <Yourself> i'm adding a filter to my email that deletes any email that has the words "world of warcraft" in it
[11:40] <Speljohan_> good call Yourself

[11:40] <Speljohan_> so many spam emails
[11:40] <eritz> have 419 scams moved into the 21st century or something?
[11:40] <Visiiri> Unfortunately, your future wife's email is 'worldofwarcraftbabe'

[11:49] <Speljohan_> take this irc i've been in for the past 10 years
[11:49] <Speljohan_> started out as a friendly place

[11:51] <Azathoth> you're basically saying we're all uninteresting fucks and you hate us
[11:51] <Azathoth> and you expect us to care?
[11:51] <Visiiri> Nope.
[11:51] <Visiiri> You're a quite interesting group, really
[11:51] <DBN> you seem to care
[11:51] <Marach-17> hm, he does
[11:52] <Visiiri> I am trying to figure out why I stay in this chatroom after all this time.

[11:52] <Yourself> <Azathoth> you're basically saying we're all uninteresting fucks and you hate us
[11:52] <Azathoth> maybe because you like it?
[11:52] <Visiiri> All of the people that I really grew to like have left.
[11:52] <Yourself> you know, repeating what he says, or even summing up, defeats the purpose of my ignore
[11:52] <Visiiri> And now all I get is constant fights.
[11:52] <Marach-17> i cannot be uninteresting! i'm too creative
[11:52] <Marach-17> :3
[11:53] <Azathoth> then grow to like new people, visiiri
[11:53] <Azathoth> time doesn't stand still
[11:53] <Speljohan_> the first community (and arguably the longest-lasting) i've been/am in is awesome in its current incarnation
[11:53] <Marach-17> NEW people? ew
[11:53] <Visiiri> I, unfortunately, do not appreciate friendships. I would rather have respect come first.
[11:53] <Azathoth> missing the old days gets you nowhere
[11:53] <Speljohan_> someone posts to get help
[11:54] <Speljohan_> followed by 20 pages of spam
[11:54] <Marach-17> someone else links to wiki
[11:54] <Speljohan_> to insult poster
[11:54] <Speljohan_> :D
[11:54] <Visiiri> And I am yet to meet many new people that really deserve respect.
[11:54] <Marach-17> seriously, there is nothing that hasn't been answered already
[11:54] <Azathoth> sounds lovely, speljohan
[11:54] <Visiiri> vurtual is one of the few.
[11:54] <Marach-17> <Visiiri> And I am yet to meet many new people that really deserve respect.
[11:54] <Marach-17> same
[11:54] <Speljohan_> it is Azathoth!
[11:54] <Azathoth> LOL WHAT
[11:54] <Azathoth> >respect
[11:54] <Azathoth> >vurtual
[11:54] <Azathoth> good one
[11:54] <Speljohan_> respect and irc dont go together
[11:54] <Visiiri> I know, it doesn't really make sense. I constantly harass him, too.
[11:55] <Marach-17> new people = noobs = stupid, answered questions = rtfm = mibbit
[11:55] <Speljohan_> it's all about the person with the banhammer setting the rules
[11:55] <Marach-17> when one is true, all else are
[11:55] <vurtual> I'm pretty much a man of infinite knowledge who is entirely different to everyone who knows him.
[11:55] <Speljohan_> and everyone else either comforming to it or die
[11:55] <Azathoth> vurtual, you're a babbling idiot
[11:55] <vurtual> To you, yes.
[11:55] <Azathoth> (no offense, i love you and everything)
[11:55] <Marach-17> lol
[11:55] <vurtual> See!
[11:55] <Visiiri> But he is wise in the way that when he knows something, he doesn't take shit about it.
[11:55] <Azathoth> but jesus you can be annoying
[11:55] <Speljohan_> fail Azathoth ! you showed off a weakness
[11:55] <Marach-17> everyone can
[11:55] <Azathoth> not like vurtual >_>
[11:56] <Speljohan_> sympathy is like aids for ircers
[11:56] <Visiiri> I often am swayed by opinions, and I lack balls. (I first wrote 'like' instead of 'lack, then fixed it.)
[11:56] <Yourself> hmm
[11:56] <Azathoth> you like balls too, visiiri

[11:56] <Yourself> that'd be hilariously evil
[11:56] <Speljohan_> lool
[11:56] <Visiiri> :) Fine.

[11:56] <Azathoth> no

[11:56] <Visiiri> Balls r gud?
[11:56] <Azathoth> don't be a dick, yourself
[11:56] <Azathoth> bawls are pretty good too
[11:56] <Yourself> no, i won't
[11:57] <PuyoDead> Holy crap, it's 4am.

[11:58] <Yourself> <Azathoth> how is it 30 minutes off where you are?
[11:58] <Azathoth> using the word smexi almost warrants an /ignore
[11:58] <Yourself> there are offset timezones
[11:58] <Visiiri> :P
[11:58] <Azathoth> yourself, why the fuck would anyone do that. :|
[11:59] <Icet1> my skin http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Icet1 ^^
[11:59] <Yourself> if you're a small region on the border of a standard timezone
[11:59] <Visiiri> Needs more TImeshift.
[11:59] <Visiiri> Timeshift > all
[11:59] <Visiiri> Iguana made an amazing TImeshift skin
[11:59] <Visiiri> but I can't manage to find it :(
[11:59] <Yourself> newfoundland comes to mind
[11:59] <Azathoth> that skin is really gay :|
[12:00] <Icet1> :D
[12:00] <vurtual> it's 3am why am I up
[12:00] <Visiiri> I hate it when people use 'fag' or 'gay' as an insult.
[12:00] <vurtual> I have to go be awesome some more tomorrow
[12:00] <Yourself> i think india is also offset
[12:00] <Azathoth> dirtman to the rescue
[12:00] <Visiiri> It is pretty much a substitute for 'stupid' and 'dumb'.
[12:00] <Yourself> and part of australia
[12:00] <Azathoth> well fuck those countries/parts of countries >_>
[12:00] <vurtual> How else am I going to perfect dual wielding katanas while balancing on a tightrope in ah urricane?
[12:00] <Visiiri> That's calling all people with homosexual interests 'stupid' and 'dumb'.
[12:00] <Visiiri> Incredibly stereotypical.
[12:00] <Azathoth> omg visiiri. drop it.
[12:01] <Speljohan_> stereotypes shape the world
[12:01] <Icet1> wtf is this the minecraft channel???
[12:01] <Visiiri> Unfortunately, Speljohan_ is right.
[12:01] <Azathoth> yes icet1
[12:01] <vurtual> without stereotypes we would have an infinite fear of everything.
[12:01] <vurtual> Everything, even our own hands! How would we know that they aren't going to become explosions!
[12:01] <Visiiri> Icet1: This is the Important Debates Central with some games and some news and some flame wars and some other stuffs channel, not Minecraft.
[12:02] <Azathoth> minecraft takes precedence
[12:02] <Azathoth> let's talk about Icet1's skin
[12:02] <Icet1> :(
[12:02] <vurtual> but nobody cares about mc
[12:02] <Visiiri> #IDCWSGASNASFWASOS for shorts.
[12:02] <Speljohan_> stereotyping is just a modern day expression of mans native instinct to fear that which is different than ourselves
[12:02] <Azathoth> honestly i find it a bit confusing
[12:02] <vurtual> I stereotype the internet to have some kind of acceptance to common sense, Speljohan_.

[12:02] <Azathoth> what a FAG
[12:02] <Speljohan_> haha vurtual
[12:02] <Visiiri> Are personal opinions able to be racist?
[12:03] <Yourself> http://www.minecraft.net/skin/skin.jsp?user=Yourself
[12:03] <Visiiri> I mean, I've always found colored women less attractive, does that make me racist?
[12:03] <Speljohan_> no
[12:03] <vurtual> not really
[12:03] <vurtual> technically in ways yes, in ways no
[12:03] <Azathoth> visiiri yes
[12:03] <Speljohan_> and i share Visiiri's taste in women it seems
[12:03] <Visiiri> Let's go with 'no'.
[12:03] <Azathoth> THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING EQUAL TREATMENT
[12:03] <Visiiri> I mean, I'm not saying that all black ladies are ugly, I just think that a beachblonde aussie > all
[12:03] <Azathoth> THEREFORE YOU, SIR, ARE A RACIST!
[12:04] <Speljohan_> however, pulling the racist card is probably the oldest trick in the book

[12:04] <Azathoth> yeah
[12:04] <Yourself> <Speljohan_> and i share Visiiri's taste in women it seems
[12:04] <Yourself> you like penis?
[12:04] <Azathoth> you can't really blame someone for not liking the looks of a certain group of women
[12:04] <Speljohan_> yes Yourself :)
[12:04] <Azathoth> it's not so much racism as it is personal taste
[12:04] <Icet1> so
[12:04] <Icet1> i?
[12:04] <Yourself> well, there's no problem with that
[12:04] <Yourself> just want to be clear
[12:04] <vurtual> Tomorrow I shall time travel to an ancient time, with a sniping, magazine-fed, 4-5 foot long shotgun, and educate people with modern sicence.
[12:04] <Azathoth> now if you start saying "black women are so ugly they don't deserve to live" it's another story
[12:04] <vurtual> zzz
[12:04] <Speljohan_> and there's a difference between xenophobia and racism Azathoth
[12:05] <Speljohan_> most people don't seem to grasp this though
[12:05] <Azathoth> sniping with a shotgun?....
[12:05] <Visiiri> That reminds me of a win Assassin's Creed joke.
[12:05] <Visiiri> While you're outside Da Vinci's home talking to your mother, she's all like- 'I really think that you need more outlets.'
[12:05] <Visiiri> 'I have plenty of outlets!'
[12:06] <Visiiri> 'I mean other than vaginas.
[12:06] <Visiiri> I pissed myself when I heard that.
[12:06] <Azathoth> that wouldn't be really effective from any long range
[12:06] <Azathoth> hah i remember that
[12:06] <AndrewPH> I jsut made $250 dollars
[12:06] <AndrewPH> what should i buy that's a game

[12:08] <Azathoth> i want to kill every griefer i've ever seen
[12:08] <Azathoth> in horrific ways
[12:08] <Visiiri> Worst way to die? Being tied down and having thousands of starving pidgeons eat you.

[12:12] <Visiiri> Icet1 is a ban.
[12:12] <Yourself> /ignore *!*Mibbit*@*
[12:12] <Azathoth> you know, not all mibbit users are completely worthless human beings
[12:12] <LG_Legacy> Puyo's call
[12:12] <Marach-17> because i can predict what client is someone using just by looking at what he types
[12:12] <Marach-17> with almost 100% accuracy.
[12:12] <Azathoth> i was a mibbit user once too
[12:12] <Visiiri> Spamming 'I LIKE BIG PENIS BIG PENIS' isn't bannable now?
[12:12] <Yourself> no, but enough of them are to warrant me ignoring the client as a whole

[12:15] <Visiiri> He's exceptionized.
[12:15] <Visiiri> zomg moar insanity
[12:15] <Yourself> the expected value of my enjoyment increased when i added the mibbit-wide ignore

[12:15] <Azathoth> lol
[12:15] <Marach-17> yeah. i once added it before
[12:15] <Azathoth> i imagine this channel is pretty lonely for yourself
[12:15] <Marach-17> SUDDENLY all noobs disappeared
[12:15] <Marach-17> seriously
[12:15] <Yourself> i like it quite

[12:15] <Visiiri> Azathoth: it probably is, he ignores everyone.
[12:15] <Azathoth> yep
[12:16] <Visiiri> He'll be gone soon enough, and then I'll be pleased.
[12:16] <Marach-17> it's creepy

[12:22] <Marach-17> ffuuuu my bot is banned
[12:22] <Visiiri> He made 'bots'
[12:22] <Marach-17> ew, "Minecraft" is banned
[12:22] <Visiiri> We couldn't ban him because the server didn't have IPBan technology
[12:22] <Marach-17> don't nick that
[12:23] <Visiiri> then he threatened to hack our server with a lua plugin
[12:23] <Visiiri> :\
[12:23] <AndrewPH> Visiiri, Myne has ipban what are you talking about
[12:23] <Visiiri> AndrewPH: I was around before it had ipban.
[12:23] <Visiiri> :\
[12:23] <AndrewPH> It always had ipban
[12:23] <Visiiri> Incorrect.
[12:23] <AndrewPH> it was one of the first few features of myne

[12:35] <Roadcrosser> I was saying to arry on the sunject in an external and related channel
[12:35] <Roadcrosser> as it is not allowed jere
[12:35] <Visiiri> I've realized that I came to minecraft about twenty days behind everyone else.
[12:35] <AndrewPH> Roadcrosser, The Archives is a custom server
[12:36] <Roadcrosser> and?
[12:36] <AndrewPH> you had a link to their irc channel
[12:36] <AndrewPH> therefore it is and advertisment
[12:36] <Roadcrosser> you were talking about it
[12:36] <Marach-17> therefore stop talking about it
[12:36] <Roadcrosser> I was merely suggesting to continue there
[12:36] <Roadcrosser> if you wanted to
[12:36] <Visiiri> Roadcrosser: That's just a channel rule.
[12:36] <AndrewPH> Roadcrosser, I was talking about myne
[12:36] <Roadcrosser> eh what
[12:36] <Visiiri> However, advertising is against Espernet Rules.
[12:36] <Visiiri> Therefore, you lost.

[12:42] <Visiiri> Marach is right, really.

[12:47] <eritz> the correct answer is 'five days, eighteen hours, twenty minutes, and five seconds'
[12:47] <Marach-17> 5 days isn't long either
[12:48] <eritz> oh, it definitely can be
[12:48] <Marach-17> nope. not in minecraft

[22:50] <Snowman> My version
[22:50] <Snowman> Includes Dutch NS trains!
[22:51] <Snowman> Anyway, we have a server already?
[22:51] <Marach-17> my brain keeps rickrolling me :(
[22:52] <Marach-17> shroomer: that's just classic NES mario with more characters
[22:52] <Marach-17> everything's the same
[22:52] <Snowman> I chose Mario
[22:52] <Marach-17> pixel per pixel
[22:52] <shroomer> yep
[22:52] <Snowman> Cause that's so cool
[22:52] <Marach-17> not really
[22:52] <shroomer> i think it is teh coolest game efar
[22:53] <Marach-17> o rly? then play the original
[22:53] <Marach-17> it's even better
[22:53] <Marach-17> animator stop not being here
[22:55] <vurtual> there's a few minor changes
[22:55] <shroomer> im being samus
[22:55] <vurtual> like, unnoticably tiny things I noticed at first, then forgot.
[22:55] <Marach-17> nerfing?
[22:56] <blaster> Andrew +ophax
[22:56] <vurtual> random, minor details out of place
[22:56] <blaster> Snowman nice traincraft thing
[22:56] <vurtual> samus sucks partially because you can't even shoot most enemies without first getting powerups.
[22:56] <blaster> Like how you did the curved pieces
[22:56] <blaster> AndrewPH you still there?
[22:57] <AndrewPH> generating level
[22:57] <shroomer> oh well i ran out of time because i died
[22:57] <blaster> Snowman for the next version I am gona make a fairly major change
[22:57] <vurtual> also link is the first zelda's sprites, but works like zelda 2, even though the first zelda technically had sideview rooms.
[22:57] <Snowman> Anway, where's the server?
[22:57] <shroomer> what is it called
[22:58] <Marach-17> in teh interwebz
[22:58] <blaster> I will change the last 3 cloth blocks and mossy cobblestone into diagonal pieces
[22:58] <shroomer> im pushing the stumble button
[22:58] <Snowman> Ah, it's public
[22:58] <Snowman> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=461c71d7de5b82d5ca477c03cfb10bbc

[22:58] <Snowman> Everyone join! :D
[22:59] <blaster> The new version of traincraft will be out 2moro
[22:59] <shroomer> yeeaa the link doesnt work for me
[22:59] <Marach-17> Snowman: ?
[22:59] <Marach-17> what's that
[22:59] <blaster> Traincraft
[22:59] <Marach-17> and what is that
[22:59] <blaster> Minecraft texture mod
[23:00] * Eythor (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[23:00] <blaster> Adds traintracks and trains
[23:00] <shroomer> so the server is called traincraft?
[23:00] <Marach-17> and? do they move?
[23:00] <blaster> No
[23:00] <shroomer> nyet
[23:00] <Marach-17> then it's yet another texture mod
[23:00] <blaster> Unless someone makes a custom server that turns the rail blocks into 'convayers'
[23:00] <Marach-17> that would be fun
