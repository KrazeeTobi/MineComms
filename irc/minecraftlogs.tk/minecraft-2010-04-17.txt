[0:01] <Zombicus> Textures essentially work like those old paper 3d models you could cut out fold and tape, amirite?
[0:02] <Snowman> Yup
[0:02] <Snowman> THey're basically wrapped around the model
[0:02] <Zombicus> Cool. Now I have a better understanding. :U
[0:02] <Zombicus> Now to blow up the textures and print them out, and make 3d paper models, rofl.
[0:02] <Snowman> Ever part of the texture has a certain part of the model assigned to it
[0:02] <Snowman> Zombicus, check the PaperCraft thread

[0:15] <Drewseph> yes
[0:15] <Drewseph> it

[0:16] <Drewseph> because it was a bug
[0:16] <Drewseph> an awesome bug
[0:16] <Drewseph> but a bug none the less
[0:16] <Drewseph> it was a bug that didn't make the game feel cheap
[0:16] <Ten_Tacles> Lol`?
[0:16] <CruelNoise> i hear the wii collection is bad.
[0:16] <CruelNoise> is this true?
[0:16] <Drewseph> you had to be a pro to use it right
[0:16] <Ten_Tacles> It was still there
[0:16] <Ten_Tacles> Oh
[0:16] <Snowman> What am I listening to?
[0:16] <Drewseph> yes Cruise
[0:16] <Marach> ...collection?
[0:16] <Drewseph> well the control is amazing
[0:16] <Snowman> A fucking morning radio show at 22:16
[0:16] <Drewseph> the Wii is perfect for FPS
[0:17] <Icereed> In 5 Minutes lvie on AIR
[0:17] <Icereed> *live
[0:17] <serp> hai guys
[0:17] <Drewseph> and MP wii is a perfect expample
[0:17] <serp> whats up
[0:17] <CruelNoise> but i hear the toned it down majorly?
[0:17] <Snowman> The wii is perfect for thrash
[0:17] <Snowman> trash*
[0:17] <Drewseph> but they BUTCHERED THE GAMES (1 and 2)
[0:17] <CruelNoise> cuuuurse the pee
[0:17] <CruelNoise> brb
[0:17] <Marach> Snowman: http://freedomofphiladelphia.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/stfu.jpg
[0:17] <rkng> <Drewseph> the Wii is perfect for FPS
[0:17] <rkng> :|
[0:17] * FontPeg (localhost@c-75-74-41-182.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:17] <Drewseph> sorry I hate dual analogue
[0:17] <serp> rkng: it is though
[0:17] <Ten_Tacles> I like the wii.
[0:17] <Drewseph> and I don't include PC
[0:17] <Marach> same as Drewseph
[0:18] <Drewseph> PC will always be on top for FPS
[0:18] <Drewseph> console wise I say wii
[0:18] <rkng> Oh
[0:18] <Marach> yeah :/
[0:18] <serp> wii doesnt use dual analogue
[0:18] <rkng> Yeah I thought you were implying it was better than PC
[0:18] <Marach> true
[0:18] <rkng> Would've flipped my shit
[0:18] <Snowman> Console wise I say Wii isn't even a current-generation console
[0:18] <serp> which is exactly why is stands out
[0:18] <Drewseph> lol
[0:18] <Drewseph> sorry for that
[0:18] <Drewseph> =)
[0:18] <rkng> :D
[0:18] <rkng> Snowman, it isn't
[0:18] <Snowman> The wii would've been awesome last generation
[0:18] <Drewseph> Snow I do agree
[0:18] <Quatroking> the wii is an improved media player
[0:19] <Drewseph> It lacks power =(
[0:19] <Drewseph> but the crontol is totally next gen
[0:19] <Quatroking> it lacks real games
[0:19] <Marach> i dont need uber graphics.
[0:19] <Drewseph> I am glad they went with it
[0:19] <Snowman> If you want the motion stuff, use the new PS3 stuff
[0:19] <rkng> In terms of graphics, it's a downgrade from the Gamecube
[0:19] <Drewseph> the next console should be far superior
[0:19] <serp> Drewseph: i'm with you man
[0:19] <Drewseph> Rkng no its not
[0:19] <Quatroking> There's too much casual gaming on the wii
[0:19] <Drewseph> truth is, people (devs) are lazy
[0:19] <Marach> ps3 is more expensive and has NO GAMES i would like to play (and are exclusives)
[0:19] <Drewseph> and just don't want to try once they know its just a GC
[0:19] <Quatroking> I want to play real games, not some shitty sport thing
[0:19] <Snowman> Ps3 has plenty of good games
[0:19] <Drewseph> which is why everyhting klooks half ass
[0:19] <rkng> True
[0:20] <Quatroking> ps3 is fucking expensive
[0:20] <Snowman> And at least it has REAL games instead of kids games
[0:20] <Drewseph> but when you see something like mario galaxy, you can tell it has potential
[0:20] <Marach> "good games" != games i would like
[0:20] <Snowman> Ps3 is like 300 euros
[0:20] <Drewseph> can't come close to 360 or ps3
[0:20] <Drewseph> but it can look far better than GC
[0:20] <Quatroking> thats expensive
[0:20] <rkng> PS3 has Demon's Souls
[0:20] <rkng> 'nuff said
[0:20] <Marach> Snowman: yeah. i can get a wii for 2x cheaper
[0:20] <Snowman> A wii is like 200 euros, while it's worth like 50
[0:20] * JabJabJab (JoshuaEdwa@pool-96-226-221-249.dllstx.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:20] <serp> the wii is the most sold console ever
[0:20] <Snowman> PS3 has god of war 3 and heavy rain
[0:21] <serp> is short, the market disagrees Snowman
[0:21] <Marach> /ignored Snowman.
[0:21] <Snowman> serp, only cause of "casual" gamers
[0:21] <Drewseph> heavy rain is about the only good thing on the PS3
[0:21] <Drewseph> and its only mediocre
[0:21] <Snowman> LbP?
[0:21] <Drewseph> its a great experience, but even the game is not perfect
[0:21] <vurtual> whee I won 2 matches in a row
[0:21] <Drewseph> too many plot holes
[0:21] * TheOne (TheOne@ks-76-7-196-124.dhcp.embarqhsd.net) Quit (Quit: ~ Trillian Astra - www.trillian.im ~)
[0:21] <Drewseph> whats LbP?
[0:21] <Snowman> Little Big Planet
[0:21] <Drewseph> never heard of it
[0:21] <Snowman> What?
[0:21] <Snowman> You live under a rock?
[0:21] <Drewseph> LOL
[0:22] <Drewseph> hee hee hee
[0:22] <Drewseph> I troll you
[0:22] <vurtual> no he's just not familliar with the large selection of nogames on the ps3
[0:22] <Snowman> Anyway
[0:22] <Snowman> All consoles suck, PC wins
[0:22] <Snowman> /discussion
[0:22] <Drewseph> ^ this
[0:22] <Drewseph> I love the wii
[0:22] <Drewseph> but I agree
[0:22] <Drewseph> PC should have everything
[0:23] <Snowman> Only bad thing about PC is DRM
[0:23] <Quatroking> uh
[0:23] <Marach> lbp? maybe when sony stops banning all CFW's online
[0:23] * Kimd41 (chatzilla@212.183.196.16.dyn.user.ono.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[0:23] <Quatroking> you know, the DS has DRM too
[0:23] <Quatroking> sort of
[0:23] <Marach> it doesnt matter, pirated or not.

[0:24] <Quatroking> Drewseph, "should"?
[0:24] <Quatroking> pretty sure we already have everything
[0:24] <Snowman> Some epic games not :/
[0:24] <Snowman> Like GOW and HR
[0:24] <Quatroking> well yeah, gamewise, not
[0:24] <Quatroking> but hardware wise we have everything and even more
[0:25] <vurtual> hr?
[0:25] <Snowman> Heavy Rain
[0:25] <vurtual> pfft
[0:25] <Snowman> lrn2stayupdatedingamesworld
[0:25] <CruelNoise> i just learned that japan will soon be the first country in the world where above 50% of the population is older than 50.
[0:25] <vurtual> next you'll say we need mw2
[0:26] <Snowman> lol, mw2
[0:26] * CruelNoise still wants borderlands....
[0:26] <Snowman> PC already has MW2.
[0:26] <vurtual> well yeah
[0:26] * Rawer (chatzilla@static243-185-214.adsl.no) has joined #minecraft
[0:26] <vurtual> but do you want to spend 15 dollars on maps?
[0:26] <vurtual> it is not a pc game
[0:26] <vurtual> it is an xbox game made to work with steam
[0:26] <Snowman> I am a Valve gamer
[0:26] <Snowman> I do not pay for DLC
[0:26] <vurtual> 36% of quake live players have never played an online match.
[0:27] <CruelNoise> XD
[0:27] <CruelNoise> that's me. nearly
[0:27] <Marach> lol
[0:27] <vurtual> I shockingly do not have the "complete 5 of each online game type" award
[0:27] <vurtual> less than 2% of players do
[0:27] <Snowman> Wait
[0:27] * Snowman checks if he has Quake Online
[0:27] <vurtual> less than 1% of players have played every map.
[0:28] <Rawer> is it possible to play lan server on minecraft? cos other in my network can't join
[0:28] <Snowman> I have all QUake games but not Quake Live :/
[0:28] <vurtual> quake live's free Snowman
[0:28] <Snowman> It's some free thing?
[0:28] <vurtual> just register
[0:28] <Snowman> Ah
[0:28] <Snowman> I bought all games on steam recently for 15 euros
[0:28] <vurtual> all?
[0:28] <CruelNoise> because nobody plays duel
[0:28] <vurtual> almost the same amount who have gotten that ridiculously specific score for ctf have played all arenas
[0:28] <vurtual> duel's hardcore dude
[0:29] * Rawer (chatzilla@static243-185-214.adsl.no) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:29] <vurtual> why do only 1% of players have "space cadet", for all space maps, eh?
[0:29] <vurtual> Furthermore most duel arenas are played at least once or twice in smaller deathmatch games
[0:29] <vurtual> I wonder how many 15min matches I have to do for "sick day"
[0:29] <Koko|MW2> Snowman
[0:29] <Koko|MW2> how

[0:29] <vurtual> 24
[0:30] <Koko|MW2> oh fuck nevermind
[0:30] <Snowman> Koko|MW2, it was a Steam Offer
[0:30] <Koko|MW2> do you mean all valve games?
[0:30] <serp> vurtual: have you programmed any cool stuff?
[0:30] <Koko|MW2> is the offer still up?
[0:30] <Snowman> No, all QUake games
[0:30] <Snowman> I DO have all Valve games though...
[0:31] <vurtual> I'm missing half-life: source, day of defeat, day of defeat: source, counter-strike, and counter-strike: condition zero
[0:31] <vurtual> yeah that's it
[0:31] <vurtual> I could probably put all of those on a wishlist and probably get gifted one of them in ten seconds because I add so many people
[0:31] <Snowman> What about RIcochet?
[0:31] <vurtual> oh no ricochet either
[0:31] <CruelNoise> well, g2g

[1:17] <vurtual> what would you have
[1:17] <Quatroking> :(
[1:17] <Splatticus> I'm kinda with Dommys. There was a woman who was unofficially married to a ferris wheel. And I mean, I didn't go 'ZOMG FUUUUUUUU' because of it. I don't see why we should get all in a tizzy about people doing something that's set in law, whether it be to their cat, or to six or seven different women. What they do behind their closed doors is their business. The only reason it's even a problem is because people opt to make it one. T
[1:17] <Splatticus> he media puts a spotlight on it. I'm not going to marry six different women, simply because I don't have the ability to focus on six different women and I would feel... rude. But as it stands, I'm pro-choice on just about anything. If some dude down the street wants to marry his horse, and some guy down the other half of the street wants to marry six different women, as long as they don't do fucking weird shit in their yard, I don'

[5:01] <Splatticus> I just had.
[5:01] <Splatticus> a mind blowing idea.
[5:01] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9NP-AeKX40 warning
[5:01] <Splatticus> We're going to get buckets, right?
[5:01] <Splatticus> Well what if there was tar?
[5:01] <KodaichiZero> alright, I'm bracing my brain for impact
[5:01] <Splatticus> And you could get buckets of tar.
[5:01] <Splatticus> And slather stone with it.
[5:01] <Splatticus> And then use the flint to light the tar on fire.
[5:01] <Splatticus> Also unlit tar could be used as a sticky trap.
[5:01] <KodaichiZero> Already discussed this with someone, except for crude oil
[5:02] <Splatticus> Basically it would make for like, fire-bricks that don't go out.
[5:02] <KodaichiZero> hmm
[5:02] <PixelEater> quick vote: indev or infdev?
[5:02] <Splatticus> Infdev
[5:02] <PixelEater> i say indev.
[5:02] <KodaichiZero> indev is more fun to me

[5:05] <vurtual> there should be a fat mob that rolls at you
[5:05] <vurtual> and if you hit him, he rolls away
[5:05] <vurtual> only suffers damage from extreme falldamage
[5:05] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:05] <vurtual> so knock him down hard enough that he squishes down hard enough to take damage
[5:06] <KodaichiZero> nice idea
[5:06] <KodaichiZero> @splatticus
[5:07] <KodaichiZero> vurtual: Still waiting on an additional weapon that gives bigger knockback, ie a hammer
[5:07] <KodaichiZero> that'd make it really fun.

[5:09] <vurtual> a mace
[5:09] <vurtual> a pike that you smack things with
[5:10] <KodaichiZero> I'm thinking also daggers could be fast and weak and have little knockback
[5:11] <KodaichiZero> and spears would be somewhat weaker, somewhat slower, but have better range

[5:27] <vurtual> well in quake 3, arena gate has that creepy mouth for the red armor
[5:27] <Furyhunter> Like the gushing layered wound
[5:28] <Furyhunter> in doom 1
[5:28] <Furyhunter> and the stretched out hole in The Icon of Sin's head
[5:28] <vurtual> and lost world has a creepy waving-back-and-forth mouth on the ceiling
[5:28] <Furyhunter> that you shoot at in doom 2
[5:28] <vurtual> that and some symbols
[5:28] <KodaichiZero> hmm yeah
[5:29] <KodaichiZero> i guess I'm not easily bothered
[5:29] <vurtual> though the rest doesn't creep me out anymore
[5:29] <vurtual> shockingly I've yet to see a single texture mod for this.
[5:29] <KodaichiZero> aww
[5:29] <vurtual> so if I do get these games I'm gonna make a mod where they're all robots or something.
[5:29] <KodaichiZero> I just found quake live in my appdata
[5:30] <KodaichiZero> nothing looks editable
[5:30] <vurtual> KodaichiZero you can extract it for sure

[5:30] <KodaichiZero> hmm
[5:30] <vurtual> I'm downloading the quake II demo now and hoping since it's quake II, it'll be less creepy

[5:40] <Dommys> Yeah.. probably.
[5:40] <vurtual> what exactly is lookspring hmmm
[5:41] <Dommys> Keeps your view level with the ground
[5:41] <Dommys> and in the direction you're traveling, I think
[5:41] <Dommys> You can mouselook still
[5:41] <Dommys> But it will "spring" back to center
[5:41] <Dommys> Atleast, that's most games.
[5:41] <vurtual> quake II
[5:42] <vurtual> does nothing to snap view
[5:42] <Dommys> Does it have the option for lookspring?

[5:47] <KodaichiZero> no... not really

[5:48] <Splatticus> I can't believe I trusted you, Kodai. ]:
[5:49] <Yourself> and everything has to be good for something
[5:49] <Splatticus> I mean like.
[5:49] <Splatticus> You should be able to make clay from dirt.
[5:49] <Splatticus> And from clay make like, clay-pidgeon frisbees as a lowquality ranged weapon.
[5:49] <KodaichiZero> uhh dude
[5:49] <Splatticus> It didn't work.
[5:49] <KodaichiZero> 2 iron bars and a stick makes a sword
[5:50] <KodaichiZero> or course dirt can make bricks
[5:50] <Splatticus> What does that have to do with anything?
[5:50] <Splatticus> Dirt.

[6:34] <Koko|minecraft> and I agree, dirt makes for nice cheap steps.
[6:34] <Splatticus> I just think more dirt = bad idea.
[6:34] <Koko|minecraft> and a temporary door at night XD
[6:34] <Koko|minecraft> I understand, Splatticus
[6:34] <KodaichiZero> dirt is the spice on our big, delicious crusty bread of an earth.
[6:34] <Koko|minecraft> if you've gone through the trouble of uncovering stone, which you can use
[6:34] <Koko|minecraft> you don't want it turned into dirt, which you can't :V
[6:34] <vurtual> no it's the icing
[6:35] <Splatticus> I want basic bricks to have up to the five prime uses.
[6:35] <KodaichiZero> D:<
[6:35] <vurtual> if the earth were cake
[6:35] <Koko|minecraft> my concern is just that Creepers are making the environment look kind of bad.
[6:35] <KodaichiZero> ok
[6:35] <vurtual> then dirt is the thick and inconsistent icing applied artfully
[6:35] <Koko|minecraft> because they're uncovering stone and then it just sits there
[6:35] <Koko|minecraft> being ugly
[6:35] <primis> I blame notch
[6:35] <vurtual> patch it up
[6:35] <Koko|minecraft> I suppose if I were so inclined I could cover up the dirt myself
[6:35] <Koko|minecraft> >.>
[6:35] <Koko|minecraft> I'm positive some creeper would blow me up in the process though.
[6:35] <KodaichiZero> Creepers are the souls of trees who had their trunks ravaged and their leaves left to fade away
[6:36] <Koko|minecraft> when MP arrives, I will always work in teams of two.
[6:36] <Koko|minecraft> there will be two jobs.
[6:36] <KodaichiZero> they exist to make us humans fade away
[6:36] <Koko|minecraft> one: whatever needs doing
[6:36] <Koko|minecraft> two: creeper check
[6:36] <Koko|minecraft> because those guys just pop up the hell behind you and then you're dead before you can even escape
[6:36] <Koko|minecraft> I would also -prefer- that skeletons didn't spawn under solitary trees =__=;;
[6:37] <Koko|minecraft> but as of now Mobs are already weird so I don't mind so much
[6:37] <Koko|minecraft> I just stay in my house at night
[6:37] <KodaichiZero> except
[6:37] <KodaichiZero> wwith the new forests, most mobs can survive no problem during the day
[6:38] <KodaichiZero> and forests have wood which we need

[6:44] <KodaichiZero> no
[6:44] <KodaichiZero> The sun file is actually that big
[6:44] <Splatticus> Am gonna see if inventory of the inventory.png
[6:44] <KodaichiZero> there are just large transparent borders
[6:44] <DimJim> what
[6:44] <Roadcrosser> no imean presentability
[6:44] <DimJim> everyone knows what normally happens when a pig gets near a cliff
[6:44] <DimJim> free porkchops
[6:44] <Roadcrosser> it will look fake
[6:45] <vurtual> babysun is real
[6:45] <Splatticus> The sun file is 32 px by 32 px
[6:45] <vurtual> I was bad at changing the file
[6:45] <Roadcrosser> it will look fake if there is a background
[6:45] <Vicrry> lolz vurt :P
[6:45] <DimJim> however, i just ran into a pig that turned into a sheep while falling, and turned back into a pig when it died
[6:45] <Splatticus> Now to doublecheck my work.
[6:45] <Roadcrosser> lol
[6:45] <KodaichiZero> huh.
[6:45] <DimJim> that miner's a spy
[6:45] <jonnyabc|ingame> lol, now THAT is nutty
[6:45] <vurtual> the babysun originally was solid white
[6:46] <vurtual> then I upped the visiblity and you could faintly make out a face
[6:46] <vurtual> then, when the sun sets, the glow goes down... alot.
[6:46] <vurtual> bright, saturated glowing blue eyes of death staring you down
[6:46] <Splatticus> Rofl.. It worked. :D
[6:46] <vurtual> it still flashes nightmarishly in my vision
[6:46] <Vicrry> Does it flip or is the babysun upsidedown?
[6:46] <Splatticus> The sun did.
[6:46] <vurtual> the sun has to set and rise facing opposite ways

[6:47] <Tommerry11> arrgg.. 20% packet loss. Sattalite internet SUCKS.
[6:48] <Vicrry> can't wait for easier to manage chests. Moving that much stuffs one click at a time sucks :P
[6:48] <Roadcrosser> me too
[6:49] <Tommerry11> meh, I like the current management system.
[6:50] <Splatticus> You mean like a quick sort button, Vicrry?
[6:50] <Splatticus> Groups together tools and bricks and food?
[6:50] <Vicrry> No, like a right-click the doohickey and it moves between chest and inventory
[6:50] <Vicrry> Or maybe a grab/store all button
[6:51] <Splatticus> All.

[6:52] <Vicrry> I've got large chests full of stuffs, and they'll need to move sooner rather than later. Not looking forward to it

[8:18] <ClassiestMedic> it's confusing at first but it gets easier
[8:18] <ClassiestMedic> I foud diamonds too
[8:18] <Subculture> It'd be nice if diamonds were just SLIGHTLY easier to find.
[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> with a fucking deep mine
[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> I got raped to death by spiders 4 times
[8:19] <Subculture> Or if there were just more of them.
[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> before getting a single diamond
[8:19] <Tommerry11> ok. ill do that. deep mine.
[8:19] <Vicrry> I found 3 diamonds.
[8:19] <Subculture> I seem to fear skeletons much more than spiders, even though spiders kill me more.
[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> like, I'm tunneling
[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> and I hear something

[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> and I turn around
[8:19] <Subculture> Skeletons seem to take most of my health though, the bastards
[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> and these spiders jump at me
[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> I have 2 seconds of "WTF SHIT"
[8:19] <ClassiestMedic> and then they rape me to death

[8:22] <Animator> Then somehow imagine all possible social circles to find out who'd she be friends with what.

[8:59] <Bomb_Spammer> What is lolicon.
[8:59] <Bomb_Spammer> OH SHIT NIGGA WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
[8:59] <KodaichiZero> dude this topic is stupid
[8:59] <KodaichiZero> it's just arguing
[8:59] <Bomb_Spammer> EXACTLY
[9:00] <KodaichiZero> it should be locked and deleted
[9:00] <KodaichiZero> imo
[9:00] <KodaichiZero> Animator, you awake?
[9:00] <Bomb_Spammer> IT'S A CLEVERLY DISGUISED META TROLLING THREAD WHERE HE GETS TO TROLLERCOASTER THE FUCK OUT OF PEOPLE AND THEY AGREED TO IT SO HE CANT BE BANNED
[9:00] <Bomb_Spammer> This man deserves a fucking MEDAL not a lock
[9:00] <KodaichiZero> nvm
[9:01] <Vicrry> Problem #1: WTF you doing reading a "Forum Games" section? Problem #2: WTF you doing reading a fourm's off-topic section?
[9:01] <Subculture> Kodaichi, why would you want it locked and deleted?
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> okay whatever
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> I thought it might actually have a point
[9:01] <Subculture> Vicrry, if you read the thread, you'll know why.
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> but it was degraded to the point that it was just a flame war
[9:01] <setveen> MOO
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> I was wrong
[9:01] <Vicrry> A forum's off-topic section is like the catchall for the stupid people
[9:01] <Subculture> That's why there's a big BLACK AND RED SIGN on the first post.
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> it's EXACTLY a flame war.
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> please continue
[9:02] <Bomb_Spammer> Hey guys

[9:06] <Animator> It's not that I'm not against the thread.
[9:06] <Yourself> someone's got gnome chompski
[9:06] <LuciferZ> Can you ever be safe with that gnome staring at you?
[9:06] <Animator> It's just that many retarded people will get the wrong view of it.
[9:06] <Animator> Or, you know what?
[9:07] <Animator> Fuck it, I'm not locking it/
[9:07] <Yourself> fuckin' magnets
[9:07] <LuciferZ> Sweeeet I was about to post.
[9:07] <Bomb_Spammer> I SEE NO CAPITILIZATION IT IS NOT A DISCLAIMER
[9:07] <KodaichiZero> alright
[9:07] <Bomb_Spammer> Loling all the way to the north pole
[9:07] <KodaichiZero> read my post and RAGE.
[9:07] <Animator> Reason being is because it's only 1 person not realizing this is a joke.

[9:08] <KodaichiZero> oh
[9:09] <KodaichiZero> Alphasoldier basically said the same thing as me
[9:09] <KodaichiZero> and I unintenntionally supported him
[9:09] <Subculture> Epic post coming up.
[9:09] <KodaichiZero> bracing or impact
[9:10] <Kokopure> bracing.
[9:10] <Bomb_Spammer> Aww
[9:10] <Bomb_Spammer> Goddamn
[9:10] <Bomb_Spammer> I want tos queeze in
[9:10] <Bomb_Spammer> but insulting the above person is hard when it keeps CHANGING
[9:10] <Subculture> Animator
[9:10] <Subculture> How would it escalate? :P
[9:10] <Animator> More idiots.
[9:10] <Subculture> Oh, read my new post, not to be self aggrandizing, but I think it's comedy gold.
[9:10] <Subculture> Oh, like Alphasoldier?
[9:10] <Animator> Yes.
[9:11] <Subculture> Look at the first post.
[9:11] <Subculture> Is that disclaimer good enough, or does it not matter :/
[9:11] <Animator> I'm aware of the disclaimer.
[9:11] <Subculture> Ah okay.
[9:11] <Subculture> If Alphasoldier wasn't totally serious, he'd be an amazing troll.
[9:11] <Subculture> Because PC shit boils my blood like NOTHING else in this world.
[9:11] <Bomb_Spammer> Animator
[9:12] <Animator> But no disclaimer will ever be enough. As long as there's more people with Alphasoldier's mentality, the flames would rise more and more.
[9:12] <Bomb_Spammer> How much money/dick sucking is required to keep that topic up?
[9:12] <KodaichiZero> I'm really liking the epicness of this
[9:12] <Animator> The thread would be doomed, I'd kill it.
[9:12] <Animator> None.
[9:12] <Bomb_Spammer> Sweet
[9:12] <Animator> As long as it doesn't explode.
[9:12] <Bomb_Spammer> Because I'm saving my money for MH3
[9:13] <Subculture> lol
[9:13] <Subculture> Thanks Animator.
[9:13] <Subculture> I hadn't come across any mods yet.
[9:13] <Subculture> glad to see that minecraft has good ones, notch knows how to pick em.
[9:13] <Animator> Notch doesn't pick them.
[9:13] <Subculture> I've been a mod in several forums, but... it was a roleplay forum, a LOT more drama than this.
[9:13] <Subculture> Oh, who admins the forum?
[9:13] <LuciferZ> I am convincing :D
[9:13] <Animator> Area runs it, but ez chooses.
[9:14] <Animator> *Aera.
[9:14] <KodaichiZero> lol good post LuciferZ
[9:14] <Subculture> Ah.

[9:17] <Subculture> And there was 48 pages of this shit.
[9:17] <Subculture> And I was a moderator.
[9:17] <Subculture> Not only that, but all of the other moderators and admins were socially inept drama whores aswell.

[10:14] <Marafk> ...wtf is happening to me.
[10:14] <LuciferZ> The transformation has started!
[10:14] <Marafk> i already had 2 lucid dreams INSIDE normal dream
[10:14] <LuciferZ> Can't help you. I don't dream.
[10:14] <Marafk> everybody does

[10:15] <Merciless> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQzgI6xJEH0
[10:15] <LuciferZ> Well, I might. But if I do, I don't know.
[10:15] <Marafk> Subculture: i have a normal dream. i fall asleep inside it and have a lucid dream, but still not knowing that one level up isnt reality.
[10:16] <LuciferZ> So you dream about having a lucid dream
[10:16] <Subculture> You're 16 years old, and you're making this up for attention because you just saw Waking Life.
[10:16] <Marafk> nope
[10:16] <Marafk> Subculture: ...
[10:16] <Marafk> i dont dream about having it, i DO HAVE it inside it
[10:16] <Marafk> what is Waking Life? sounds interesting
[10:17] <Dys|sleep> Luci
[10:17] <Dys|sleep> if your drunk on my server
[10:17] <Subculture> Okay. So.. you pass into a lucid state while dreaming normally.
[10:17] <Subculture> You don't DREAM within a dream.
[10:17] <Subculture> That's not how Theta and Delta work.
[10:17] <Dys|sleep> :l
[10:17] <Dys|sleep> I dream within dreams
[10:17] <Dys|sleep> so you dawg were going to put a dream in your dream so you can dream while you dream
[10:17] <LuciferZ> Dys wut
[10:17] <Dys|sleep> idk
[10:17] <LuciferZ> You're not going to kick me are you D:
[10:17] <Dys|sleep> maybe
[10:18] <Marafk> but i still think ive falled asleep in reality instead of a dream
[10:18] <Marafk> fallen*
[10:18] <Dys|sleep> but if your like ecrider
[10:18] <Dys|sleep> when he is hammered
[10:18] <LuciferZ> But I'm even better drunk. Sometimes.
[10:18] <Dys|sleep> well get on and help in shrine
[10:18] <Dys|sleep> ecrider when drunk = awesome
[10:18] <Marafk> ah.

[10:40] <Parthon> oh oops

[10:53] <Dys|sleep> I was only wondering..
[10:53] <Splatticus> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=11808&start=0 Input appreciated. :D Thanks guys.

[10:54] <Subhazard> It's still terrible Legacy.
[10:54] <Subhazard> No effect.
[10:54] <Dys|sleep> get a new computer
[10:54] <Dys|sleep> upgrade it
[10:54] <Subhazard> Shut up Dys.
[10:55] <Dys|sleep> ok :(
[10:55] <Subhazard> Why don't you give me a better job.
[10:55] <Marach> wut?
[10:55] <Marach> he is right.
[10:55] <Subhazard> So I don't have to live off of food bills.
[10:55] <Dys|sleep> What are your computer specs?
[10:55] <Dys|sleep> I may be able to help
[10:55] <Dys|sleep> unlike mr legacy
[10:55] <Subhazard> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=11832&p=172051#p172051
[10:55] <Subhazard> There are my specs.
[10:55] <vurtual> guys here's a fun fact
[10:55] <Subhazard> Don't care vurtual.
[10:55] <LG_Legacy> Sigh
[10:55] <LG_Legacy> Sub
[10:55] <Subhazard> Fuck, I'm still in insult mode.
[10:55] <Yourself> <Subhazard> Don't care vurtual.
[10:56] <Subhazard> Sorry vurtual.
[10:56] <Dys|sleep> Sub, have you upgraded your drivers?
[10:56] <Marach> 1309mb of what?
[10:56] <Subhazard> Yes, ofcourse I have. Check the thread.
[10:56] <LG_Legacy> Probably just something eating up ram
[10:56] <Marach> that isn't really helpful
[10:56] <Subhazard> Want me to screen shot my processes?
[10:56] <vurtual> in quake 2, if you hit an enemy who doesn't know you're there, the enemy takes double damage
[10:56] <Subhazard> Marach, read the whole thread, it's very small.
[10:56] <Dys|sleep> Hmm have you increased java.exe priority to high?
[10:56] <Subhazard> I did, and it froze.
[10:56] <vurtual> theoretically you could stack a quad damage and double damage to deal like, 800 damage with a railgun.
[10:56] <Dys|sleep> Ah
[10:57] * Kokopure is now known as Koko|Oyasumi
[10:57] <Marach> fix: don't care about infdev. it's buggy and slow
[10:57] <Dys|sleep> Hmm try changing your graphics card settings
[10:57] <Dys|sleep> to give you maximum performance
[10:57] <LG_Legacy> Subhazard
[10:57] <LG_Legacy> It's probably just issues with Infdev in general
[10:57] <LG_Legacy> It's you know
[10:57] <LG_Legacy> In Development
[10:58] <Dys|sleep> Yah that also this build seems to be buggier
[10:58] * bjzaba (brendanzab@CPE-124-177-79-180.lns12.cha.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[10:58] <Dys|sleep> its running off a fresh lighting rewrite also
[10:58] <Splatticus> Yay! My spiders work!
[10:58] <Dys|sleep> that may be a source of it
[10:59] <Subhazard> Well
[10:59] <Subhazard> Messing with the priority for Java seemed to help the framerate a bit
[10:59] <Subhazard> Bit it still stutters every time I destroy or create a block
[10:59] <Subhazard> Like it's writing.
[10:59] <Marach> because it IS writing
[11:00] <Subhazard> I think the file updates every time you change a block.
[11:00] <Marach> get over it, infdev is slow
[11:00] <LG_Legacy> BAW
[11:00] <Subhazard> Marach, shut the FUCK up.
[11:00] <Marach> it will get better over time.
[11:00] <Marach> there was a moment when it was running at 15 fps for everyone
[11:00] <Subhazard> Marach, it's not a petty problem.
[11:00] <Marach> is creative faster for you?
[11:00] <Subhazard> I'm talking about like 1 fps during chunk loading.
[11:00] * Brett (brettr@CPE00226b838ab8-CM00159a0251c4.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[11:00] <Subhazard> Creative is fast-ish.
[11:01] <Marach> see? ;/
[11:01] <Subhazard> It doesn't have nearly any of the problems that infdev has.
[11:01] <Marach> it will be improved
[11:01] <Subhazard> Indev gets REALLY choppy during lighting transitions.
[11:01] <LG_Legacy> No need to be a dick Subhazard
[11:01] <Marach> because Notch fixed lighting in infdev
[11:01] <alka> sub: hell it does!
[11:01] <LG_Legacy> Thats my job
[11:01] <Marach> and left indev alone
[11:01] <Subhazard> I haven't been on able to tolerate infdev long enough to see if the lighting transition is bad on that too
[11:02] <Subhazard> I'm going to miss Indev.
[11:02] <Subhazard> I really like being able to load a smallish map and conquering it.
[11:02] <vurtual> How do I not remember parts of some movies. There are scenes from the new batman movie and starwars both, even the matrix, that are important but I've never heard of them.
[11:02] <Marach> for me, infdev takes 5 minutes of black screen to start
[11:02] <vurtual> I've watched these movies start to finish, too!
[11:02] <Subhazard> Vurtual.
[11:02] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Subhazard.
[11:02] <Subhazard> No one cares.
[11:02] <Subhazard> Not to be a dick.
[11:02] <Subhazard> But.
[11:02] <Subhazard> I'm incapable of otherwise.
[11:02] <Marach> Subhazard: who's a dick now
[11:02] <Marach> :P
[11:02] <Subhazard> Me, always.
[11:03] <LG_Legacy> Well get out then grr, lol.
[11:03] <vurtual> I am now because I said this.
[11:03] <LG_Legacy> Anyways
[11:03] <LG_Legacy> I will always be able to play indev
[11:03] <LG_Legacy> Cause i'm awesome
[11:03] <Subhazard> You snatched it?
[11:03] <vurtual> oh nvm this is from other movies too.
[11:03] <LG_Legacy> Actually not really
[11:03] <Marach> grooveshark vs parents. who will win? place your bets now!
[11:03] <LG_Legacy> The client won't work if notch ever truely takes down /Indev/
[11:03] <Subhazard> Vurtual, give me a synopsis of the conversation you're having with yourself later.
[11:03] <LG_Legacy> Anyone who is smart enough to save the indev jar though can easily make it work though.
[11:04] <Subhazard> Let's see if there's a framerate increase for indev after fucking with priorities.
[11:04] <Marach> impossible.
[11:05] <Marach> DECREASING priority can help in unresponsive controls (when an app used directinput)
[11:05] <Marach> anyway, starting grooveshark :O no bets?

[11:06] <Subhazard> If there were any more pigs in this map, It'd be made of bacon.
[11:06] <Subhazard> lol
[11:06] <Subhazard> I think notch overcompensated. He made every mob spawn that forgot to spawn in the previous versions.
[11:07] <Subhazard> That was a joke.
[11:07] <Subhazard> I'm aware that that's not how things work.
[11:08] <Marach> my library->add all
[11:08] <Subhazard> I wish notch would make a client for Minecraft.
[11:09] <Subhazard> That I could just use independent of my fucking browser.
[11:09] <Subhazard> Does anyone know which browser Minecraft gets along with the best?
[11:09] <Othilious> He has, its his dev client
[11:09] <Marach> he made clients. they just run in browser
[11:09] <Subhazard> Nevermind.
[11:09] <Othilious> But he want people to visit the site so they always have the latest client.

[11:10] <Konogan> He will makes offline clients in due time though.
[11:10] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Notch probably wouldn't like it if I released mine, with an updater
[11:10] <Subhazard> Vis.
[11:10] <Subhazard> I would marry you.
[11:10] <Othilious> Yeah.
[11:10] <Vis{ROTR2010}> All it would take is a few class files
[11:10] <LG_Legacy> The client used auto updates
[11:11] <Marach> if cpcolin could make it, Notch can too
[11:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Actually
[11:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Why do the work
[11:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I can just take cpcolins
[11:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> :P

[12:07] <bildramer> >_>
[12:07] <Azathoth> that's probably more than i weighed at that age
[12:07] <bildramer> also, height is like somewhere between 160 and 170 I guess
[12:07] <bildramer> brb measuring tape
[12:08] <Splatticus> So question.
[12:08] <Splatticus> If I dig a pit on spawn, will I fall to my death on a respawn?
[12:08] <Splatticus> Or will it spawn at the new height?
[12:08] <Serow> You'll probably fall and die. XD
[12:08] <Azathoth> good question
[12:08] <Azathoth> try it
[12:08] * Splatticus does so.
[12:09] <Azathoth> if it's like the old respawn from creative, you might respawn on the bottom
[12:09] <Yourself> anyway, i'm about 64 kg and 183 cm in height
[12:09] <bildramer> dammit, have none
[12:09] <Azathoth> i have like 5 measuring tapes
[12:09] <bildramer> mail me one
[12:09] <Azathoth> i guess that's from being a wargamer -_-
[12:09] <bildramer> :l
[12:09] <bildramer> mail, do you have AoE?
[12:10] <bildramer> inb4 mail saying "argh the beeps"
[12:10] <Yourself> wololo
[12:10] <mail2345> :l
[12:10] <Azathoth> i played AoE again yesterday
[12:10] <Azathoth> it was awesome
[12:10] <Azathoth> but for some reason water looks fucked up now
[12:10] <bildramer> well, do you have it?
[12:11] <Azathoth> where the white shimmering dots on the water used to be, there are now brightly colored ones

[12:18] <Splatticus> I got an awesome level on a level I ruined with that little test.
[12:18] <Yourself> you're not letting the hardware do that?
[12:20] <Splatticus> It'd be cool if you spawned at the new height. I'd dig a nice 3x3 hatch down about 20 blocks, hollow out underground and then build like, a sea-tunnel to surface level somewhere. That way I spawn inside the hole...
[12:20] <bildramer> Yourself: no, I'm doing everything 3D-related manually
[12:20] <bildramer> and unoptimizedly, I get nice framerates
[12:20] <Splatticus> Though I suppose if you stocked a storage case nearby with porkchops you could just eat the damage away after the fall. A like 20 block drop only took me down to about 4 hearts.. Though that was on peaceful.

[16:10] <Malikat> there's gold, it's stupid rare though

[16:48] <igotyou> thechris is that stuff working for you?
[16:48] <thechris> i didnt try it yet, ill try in indev

[16:48] <igotyou> ive tryed both indev and infdev
[16:48] <thechris> then i need to make a epic room for it...

[16:49] <igotyou> mine wouldt open completly -.-
[16:49] <thechris> LOL i got exactly 2 sand....
[16:49] <igotyou> xd
[16:49] <igotyou> and 5 torches?
[16:50] <Malikat> igotyou the problem is that the torch stays connected to the sand as it falls
[16:50] <igotyou> yes i know
[16:50] <thechris> no, i got 21 torches
[16:50] <igotyou> on 2 sides
[16:50] <igotyou> on 2 others
[16:50] <igotyou> it falls malikat
[16:50] <thechris> it worked!
[16:50] <igotyou> =P
[16:51] <igotyou> and if you place it a other place
[16:51] <igotyou> itl still be the 2 directions
[16:51] <igotyou> so its a effective compass
[16:52] <Malikat> except that it doesn't show north
[16:52] <thechris> it shows east and west

[16:52] <igotyou> yeah BAH!
[16:52] <igotyou> xd
[16:52] <Malikat> that's even MORE WORTHLESS

[16:52] <thechris> surta
[16:53] <igotyou> hmm
[16:53] <thechris> i just use 3 blocks and a torch

[17:08] <igotyou> couldnt you actully use it as a kinda logic gate..
[17:08] <igotyou> now that would be awesome
[17:08] <thechris> its a 5x5 platform, next to my 10x10 tower
[17:08] <thechris> you could

[17:14] <igotyou> i discovered

[17:14] <igotyou> that you can use it as a kinda altidtude thingy
[17:15] <thechris> and across the path of the high secrety diamond safe thing
[17:15] <igotyou> if you place a since if you place a torch
[17:15] <igotyou> lets say 4 of teh ground

[17:15] <igotyou> and then place 3 sand on it
[17:15] <igotyou> the torch you palce on the bottom sand will fall

[17:16] <igotyou> so you can use it to measure stuf
[17:16] <thechris> i got 5 blocks of gold, its behind glass, and with it spiders
[17:16] <Malikat> or you can just uh

[17:18] <Malikat> god
[17:18] <Malikat> no
[17:18] <igotyou> BAH!
[17:18] <Malikat> you're overengineering it
[17:18] <thechris> the problem with logic gates is that you need to reset it...
[17:18] <bildramer> yay Mersenne twister
[17:19] <thechris> my pool has underwater lights
[17:19] <thechris> and a tunnel going threw it...
[17:19] <igotyou> hmm but if this could somehow be used as a lgoic gate you would only need to place torches but as malikat says its probably not worth it
[17:20] <igotyou> does this bug even have any uses =/

[19:26] <FakeSky> I'd like to know how much you like the idea of the Zombie Siege game mode.
[19:27] <LuciferZ> I quite like the idea.
[19:28] <LuciferZ> With certain game constraints. Which is odd, because every other part of minecraft I want systemless.
[19:29] <FakeSky> I just like it because I WANT zombies to be the only monsters in some game mode or another
[19:29] <LuciferZ> Lol. I know what you mean
[19:29] <LuciferZ> I think it would be interesting if it worked kind of like Nazi Zombies. Where zombies could only delete wood, and humans can only repair with wood.
[19:30] <FakeSky> Barricading would be a griefing method too.
[19:30] <LuciferZ> You mean in regular MP survival?

[22:02] <bildramer> so, let's say you have a time machine
[22:02] <LuciferZ> Newest Google product.
[22:02] <bildramer> and you send a photon 20 years into the past
[22:03] <bildramer> so currently the total energy in the universe drops by the energy of the photon
[22:03] <bildramer> but in the past, it gets higher by the same amount

[22:05] <bildramer> so you just added 1 photon to the Universe
[22:05] <bildramer> woot
[22:05] <bildramer> so you have infinite energy etc. etc.
[22:06] <bildramer> problem #1: you need infinite energy to send things back in time

[22:59] <Quatroking> and notch fired him
[22:59] <Koko|Minecraft> but yeah, minecraftwiki has nothing on Ranas O_o

[23:44] <Quatroking> mail2345, is it possible to destory power cables and such
[23:44] <Quatroking> destroy*
[23:44] <mail2345> yea
[23:45] <Quatroking> how
[23:45] <mail2345> IIRC
[23:45] <mail2345> you need to open up the floor
[23:45] <mail2345> and cut the cable
[23:45] <mail2345> or
[23:45] <mail2345> just find an APC
[23:45] <mail2345> open with with a screwdriver
[23:45] <mail2345> and cut all the wires
[23:45] <mail2345> (make sure to have some gloves on)
[23:45] <Quatroking> there's this maintenance room with a power cable on the floor
[23:45] <mail2345> (APC = area power controll)
