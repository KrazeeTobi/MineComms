[1:51] <yoshibot> then it's the act of screwing a cult
[1:51] <Perry> wtf
[1:51] <O__O-OMG> i just scare people

[1:52] <ZaxKellens> If you look at it from the side, it's lava that's making it griddy

[1:53] <vurtual> What do I do, I'm bored?
[1:53] <Griob> is anyone else making underground farms to drain oceans/lakes into, in infdev?
[1:53] <vurtual> ZaxKellens already said that
[1:53] <Shadaez> O__O-OMG you're an idiot
[1:53] <yoshibot> you better have at least 150 bots if you're going to DDOS /every single one of us/.
[1:53] <ZaxKellens> Oh
[1:53] <vurtual> where'd you get that IP from anyways, Z
[1:53] <ZaxKellens> I didn't see it
[1:53] <vurtual> really
[1:53] <ZaxKellens> Oh, I see it

[1:54] <Alexofdarkness> :)
[1:54] * vurtual didn't even get to obsessively talk about their nipples
[1:54] <rob`> I stick airlocks everywhere
[1:55] <vurtual> nipplesnipplesnipples.
[1:55] <Griob> vurtual, i mean for the future
[1:55] <yoshibot> It's sort of problematic to make water act like you expect when you're entirely in blocks
[1:55] <vurtual> does water supposed to be able to flow through door?
[1:55] <yoshibot> uhh
[1:55] <yoshibot> are doors airtight?
[1:55] <ZaxKellens> I wanna find the phone number for 6700 lakota
[1:55] <ZaxKellens> Brb
[1:55] <Complexes> I only use airlocks in underwater bases in indev.
[1:55] <vurtual> I think it won't
[1:55] <vurtual> so we can just use drains and airlocks
[1:55] <JTE> The door has like four holes in the top to see through. There's no glass built into it, you know.
[1:55] <vurtual> Yeah but what will water do?
[1:55] <ZomBuster> also: remove 2 blocks from cave wall, put in door, instant isolation cell!
[1:55] <yoshibot> so it's not at all airtight then
[1:56] <vurtual> water-ify it?
[1:56] <vurtual> Run it over?
[1:56] <yoshibot> it'll probably just go through the door
[1:56] <ZomBuster> now just have to find out how to get a pig in there
[1:56] <Alexofdarkness> who was that person?

[1:56] <Griob> does anyone know which classes in indev are running water? would it be possible to transplant them to infdev? :P
[1:56] <Sestrene_the_III> Someone should herd a lot of sheep into these isolation cells.
[1:56] <vurtual> you might have water fall off the map, griob
[1:57] <Fractal> Griob: Tried, you can't
[1:57] <Griob> fall off the map?
[1:57] <ZaxKellens> I can never herd sheep, they disappear =\
[1:57] <rob`> if doors are watertight, airlocks will be simple, just two doors in succession
[1:57] <rob`> open one, close it behind you, open two
[1:57] <vurtual> I think I'm gonna herd my "isolation cell" into some sheep.
[1:57] <Azathoth> um
[1:57] <Azathoth> how can you herd an isolation cell
[1:57] <ZomBuster> Griob indev water is screwed atm anyway
[1:57] <vurtual> okay fine

[2:02] <vurtual> no, +4
[2:02] <Budda> i think i have 18 dex and 18 wis, vurtual
[2:02] <ZaxKellens> Just roll
[2:02] <vurtual> what's the Difficulty Class?
[2:02] <vede> Seif, the world ends in floating-island style edges.
[2:02] <ZaxKellens> Easy
[2:02] <vurtual> 10? 15?
[2:02] <vurtual> oh
[2:03] <ZaxKellens> Unless you roll a 1, you'll dodge it
[2:03] <yoshibot> I think the game just gets erratic and unpredictable when you hit the theoretical edge
[2:03] <vurtual> DC 5 then
[2:03] <yoshibot> assuming you have HD space and memory to go that far
[2:03] <Fractal> blaster, what kinda numbers are we looking at?
[2:03] <vurtual> rolled with modifier, a 15

[2:12] <Budda> mr_pants, well then its the server
[2:12] <yoshibot> oh, sticks. okay thanks
[2:12] <Budda> go talk to the admin
[2:12] <mr_pants> but otheones-zombies was the only server with the zombie gamemode
[2:12] <ZaxKellens> Zombie server is boring
[2:12] <mr_pants> I can't simply just give up on it.
[2:12] <vurtual> too bad
[2:12] <ZaxKellens> Too many cheaters

[2:12] <Budda> mr_pants, there will be nothing you can do, its something wrong with the server
[2:12] <Iguana> Let me guess.
[2:12] <Iguana> "Could not verify name on minecraft.net"
[2:12] <Iguana> Is that what you get?
[2:12] <mr_pants> I could try using my alt account :O
[2:12] <Budda> it wont work
[2:12] <Snowman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euXQbZDwV0w
[2:13] <yoshibot> wow. ladders are wood-intensive.
[2:13] <yoshibot> gonna need more
[2:13] <Iguana> mr_pants, blame fCraft.
[2:13] <Iguana> It's name verification stuff sucks.
[2:13] <mr_pants> it worked budda
[2:13] <Snowman> Eat da poopoo
[2:13] <Budda> wtb giant multiplayer infdev server, one giant server for everyone
[2:13] <Budda> would be balls deep awesome
[2:13] <ZaxKellens> No
[2:13] <Snowman> I know a homosexua; guy, I should totally mail him this
[2:13] <mr_pants> budda it seriously worked
[2:13] <ZaxKellens> Too many griefers
[2:13] <mr_pants> the alt account
[2:13] <vurtual> -56 health :(
[2:13] <Budda> cool bro
[2:14] <blaster> Nom nom poopoo

[2:14] <blaster> Snowman, mail him
[2:14] <aexis_rai> Snowman, did you ever finish the Christmas song thing?
[2:14] <Snowman> Yeah, nope
[2:14] <Snowman> I'll do it this christmas
[2:14] <Iguana> ONLY LIKE 7 MORE MONTHS.
[2:14] <vurtual> I have noticed ghosts do not render models through them
[2:14] <Budda> 6
[2:14] <aexis_rai> We'll have to pitch into that this year
[2:14] <vurtual> so if you die and zoom in a bit, you can see the base terrain
[2:14] <Budda> and a bit
[2:15] <aexis_rai> We have a better forum now
[2:15] <Snowman> I know what the flaw was last year
[2:15] <aexis_rai> Interest?
[2:15] <Iguana> Lack of voices.
[2:15] <aexis_rai> We had little interest
[2:15] <Snowman> People able to take a line, but not record it

[2:16] <ZaxKellens> I would hope not
[2:16] <Iguana> Make a huge pit, and ladders to climb out
[2:16] <aexis_rai> Also, my name looks all unprofessional and lowercase because the Archives IRC requires it to be

[2:17] <Adura> Stupid channel that'd force that.

[2:17] <ZaxKellens> Nobody cares
[2:17] <Perry> wait
[2:17] <ZaxKellens> I wonder how long I could listen to the leekspin song before I went crazy
[2:17] <Perry> can creepers see you through the window of the door?
[2:17] <ZaxKellens> Nevah
[2:17] <Iguana> That would be scary
[2:17] <aexis_rai> Perry, mobs don't "see," as far as I know
[2:17] <Perry> because they see you through glass
[2:17] <Iguana> A creeper outside your door "KNOCK KNOCK, LITTLE MOB"
[2:17] <Perry> I mean
[2:17] <Perry> detect
[2:18] <Iguana> And they'd look at you thru every window of your base
[2:18] <Perry> w/e
[2:18] <aexis_rai> Yes, probably
[2:18] <ZaxKellens> Anyone wanna bet how long I listen to leekspin before I go nuts?
[2:18] <Perry> >.<
[2:18] <aexis_rai> Though I've had them detect me through solid rock
[2:18] <Perry> Ieva's polka or caramelldansen? I don't remember D:

[2:44] <blaster> We work with other nations, people from any nation can join without leaving their current one
[2:44] <yoshibot> yeah. :3
[2:44] <vurtual> so my friend has a cold ray attack right
[2:44] <vurtual> so I can't even play because he just kills everything, so it's "me follow"
[2:45] <blaster> Tell the DM to throw in cold resistant enemies
[2:45] <EmpiresBane> ah fuck... you don't get a sign back when you remove it....
[2:46] <zaneo> i thought you did
[2:46] <Fractal> desroy the block it is on
[2:47] <yoshibot> definitely needs revision though, your manifesto
[2:47] <blaster> Ok, what needs revising?
[2:47] <vurtual> I have found out why grinding is uncommon in DDO, too.
[2:47] <vurtual> it's so fast it's ridiculous
[2:47] <yoshibot> the spelling and such
[2:47] <blaster> Yeh, I didnt spellcheck
[2:47] <blaster> Want me to fix that now
[2:48] <yoshibot> if you wish
[2:48] <yoshibot> mostly it'll make you look more credible
[2:48] <blaster> I had to type quick to make sure the idea didnt go away
[2:48] <vurtual> that's a brilliant idea blaster
[2:48] <vurtual> just, I can't actually tell a game to do so
[2:49] <yoshibot> if the name weren't already taken, i'd have suggested something like the Stonecutters or something
[2:49] <EmpiresBane> AndrewPH, what client is BananaBot using?

[2:51] <blaster> I fixed it up http://pastebin.com/VL4zCQai

[2:51] <yoshibot> i'm thinking something like an infdev mp server should just be one huge server
[2:52] <blaster> It will proberbly only be a few good servers
[2:52] <blaster> Like 4 or 5 of them
[2:52] <blaster> And the others will be laggy shitholes
[2:53] * fenixfurion is now known as A
[2:53] <yoshibot> it should just be /one/ really good, beefy server

[2:53] <yoshibot> i mean, it's not like there's not enough SPACE for all the settlements you want
[2:53] <blaster> Different servers will satisfy differnt preferances
[2:53] <blaster> Like there might be a peaceful server and a hard server
[2:53] <PuyoDead> Damnit, printscreen isn't screenshotting infdev.
[2:53] <yoshibot> well, yeah i see...
[2:53] <Snowman> ?
[2:54] <Snowman> It shows up black?
[2:54] <PuyoDead> Yup.
[2:54] <yoshibot> personally i'd probably run a hard-mode server
[2:54] <Snowman> Vista?
[2:54] <blaster> Printscreen wont work on fullscreen infdev
[2:54] <PuyoDead> 7
[2:54] <Snowman> Hmm...
[2:54] <PuyoDead> Well sunuva. Used to.
[2:54] <blaster> I would proberbly play easy
[2:54] <Snowman> I had that problem with a different program on Vista
[2:54] <Fractal> i've had infdev have a random intersecting segment of video from vlc once. I blame java
[2:54] <Iguana> I had problems with that on XP. :/
[2:54] <yoshibot> i think peaceful and easy servers would probably fall under more PvP attack
[2:55] <Fractal> and you could not screenshot that segment
[2:55] <yoshibot> since mobs aren't as numerous and as much of a threat
[2:55] <PuyoDead> Well crap, I guess I'll have to screenshot the little window.
[2:56] <vede> Lame, I guess ladders don't save in infdev.
[2:56] <Fractal> vede, did you quit to the menu, wait for the HDD to stop writing, then close the window?
[2:57] <vede> Fractal, yeah.
[2:57] <Fractal> well, they save on mine >.>

[3:11] <vurtual> windows is fine
[3:11] <Snowman> A cat is fine too.
[3:11] <vurtual> xp was pretty much the last version where viruses were remotely a problem for smart people.
[3:11] <EmpiresBane> the thing is, most linux users know about computers and so are able to block the few things out there
[3:11] <Animator> "OH HEY BOOBIES" "clicks link" "You've got a virus." "..no boobies?"
[3:11] <vurtual> dumb people? No hope for them.
[3:11] <yoshibot> well, yeah. i can attest to that. but there are more unfixed bugs and holes in windows than there are in linux
[3:11] <vurtual> yeah but EmpiresBane
[3:11] <DarkMidnight> i got a reallly powerful anti virus on my computer i made by myself, its callled 'Force drain '
[3:11] <vurtual> most linux users wildly trust other linux users

[3:13] <vurtual> o_o
[3:13] <Lilycat> Well, since fire chains, they really aren't. But they're loosely related in that I can burn leaves I don't want.
[3:13] <Snowman> He bought her a vibrator.

[3:16] <vurtual> then, it just becomes a pattern of the map edge

[3:25] <vurtual> Yes.
[3:25] <Animator> Congratulations.
[3:25] <Rooster> <3 doors

[3:27] <Snowman> Fuck
[3:27] <JTE> nyaa, the world should wrap around instead.
[3:27] <Snowman> I want a medal :/
[3:27] <Lilycat> Semi-permadeath. It's less permanent than regular permadeath.
[3:27] <Snowman> Does being able to get Notch to sing count?

[3:27] <vurtual> HOLD ON
[3:28] <JTE> XD
[3:28] <Animator> Nope, that's another department, Snowman.
[3:28] <ZaxKellens> I wanna see the distortion Fractal
[3:28] <Snowman> Fuck
[3:28] <JTE> Wow~
[3:28] <Lilycat> Fractal, did you cross the beams?
[3:28] <Fractal> maybe >.>
[3:28] <Animator> Printscreen. Video tape it.
[3:28] <Snowman> What about building Minecraft's first QR code?
[3:28] <ZaxKellens> Yes, what Animator says
[3:28] <Fractal> oh, and the torch flames are about a block due south of the torches
[3:28] <Animator> I just made up this right now, Snowman. Only present things count.
[3:29] <Snowman> FUUUUUUUUU
[3:29] <Snowman> Does being on IRC twice count?
[3:29] <LG_Legacy> And now
[3:29] <Lilycat> So do the torch flames go towards the center of the map, or away from it?
[3:29] <ZaxKellens> Fractal : Pics or it didn't happen
[3:29] <LG_Legacy> I'll present you with something that does not make sense.
[3:29] <SnowmanHTC> Does it?
[3:29] <Animator> That's barely an achievement.
[3:29] <LG_Legacy> http://www.geekologie.com/2007/10/24/soft-xbox.jpg
[3:29] <Fractal> apart from when they are two blocks east
[3:29] <JTE> I've seen that on DeviantArt. :3
[3:29] <vurtual> do want LG_Legacy
[3:29] <vurtual> :D
[3:30] <Animator> But yeah, videotape this, Fractal.
[3:30] <Fractal> will do
[3:30] <Fractal> what screen recorder has a high fps?
[3:30] <setveen> moo
[3:30] <Lilycat> I think he needs another medal. Everything is better with medals.

[3:39] <Fractal> EmpiresBane: no, actually
[3:39] <EmpiresBane> damn...
[3:39] <Kom> but, ai players would probably be an extraordinary pain, if you ask me.
[3:39] <ZaxKellens> I can't translate that blaster
[3:40] <Trapiki> Or a mode where random players transform into mobs and all the normal players look like other mobs to them
[3:40] <blaster> Can you get any individual words?
[3:40] <Malikat> the AI would either suck or very quickly learn to make a 2x1 coffin for itself
[3:40] <Snowman> Fractal, isn't you HDD overloaded now?
[3:40] <Trapiki> So then everyones' trying to kill each other
[3:40] <Snowman> If you went that far
[3:40] <ZaxKellens> Many = multi, few = pauci
[3:40] <Lilycat> Trapiki: So it's basically survival MP?
[3:40] <JTE> Nah, the hdd is fine, he just teleported.
[3:40] <Fractal> silly snowman, it only saved the spots i appeared at
[3:40] <JTE> Wooosh.
[3:40] <Kom> perhaps a mode where when the game starts, one player is a mob, and as they kill players, they become mobs themselves, until either one crafter remains, or the crafters survive a set time period.
[3:41] <Trapiki> Lilycat: Sort of, but everyone's trying to kill each other because they think the other is a mob

[3:42] <Trapiki> Lilycat: I'd call it Monster Madness, because that's what it'd be
[3:42] <Fractal> it does crash if you put down a sign at the height limit
[3:42] <Lilycat> At least I find Creepers to be less fond of coming in waves than zombies or skeletons.
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Oh noes
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Fractal crashed

[3:46] <EmpiresBane> what?
[3:46] <EmpiresBane> going to make a file?

[3:48] <EmpiresBane> most of that would be white
[3:48] <blaster> Does white take up HD space?

[3:53] <EmpiresBane> theren't any others i think, Fractal
[3:53] <JTE> Well it wasn't designed for teleporting. When different sections of land meet, they can't match up.
[3:53] <Kom> They don't seem to run out, ever
[3:53] <Fractal> yah, the bottom row should be all separate bits, and 32 million pixels from the left hand side
[3:54] <Fractal> hmm
[3:54] <JTE> But what are the bright green line smudges?
[3:54] <Miclee> Those rules suck, blaster.
[3:54] <Fractal> neat though
[3:54] <Miclee> No burning down forests?

[3:56] <ZaxKellens> Iron vein! iron vein!
[3:56] <Kom> Usually with forest fires, I go ahead and take out trees and such ahead of the fire
[3:56] <Trapiki> anyways, trees grow back, diamonds do not, that argument is invalid.
[3:56] <Kom> much easier than just trying to stop it where it is
[3:56] <ZaxKellens> Diamonds > Trees

[3:57] <ZaxKellens> I want diamond armor and diamond tools
[3:57] <Fractal> hehe, I used the cartographer on my main map, and dound a forest fire : http://imgur.com/k3S2P.png
[3:57] <blaster> It could harm buisness for woodcutters
[3:57] <ZaxKellens> dound?
[3:57] <Kom> If only you could compress all your useless coal into diamonds
[3:57] <ZaxKellens> Oh crap, there's a fire
[3:57] <ZaxKellens> Fires?
[3:57] <ZaxKellens> What are all those buildings?
[3:58] <vurtual> So wait, if minecraft were to get proper sky
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> And what's that map Fractal, indev island?
[3:58] <vurtual> how high would it be, before space?
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> 2k blocks
[3:58] <Fractal> ZaxKellens: That's infdev, thank you very much
[3:58] <vurtual> maybe 8x the Earth's atmospehre thickness
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> Weird
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> Is that a port you built?
[3:58] <vurtual> It'd be pretty cool if you could actually build a tower into space, you could see the planet below, and other towers.
[3:59] <Fractal> height limit on infdev = 128 blocks

[4:09] <sorre> does this statement on the wiki mean that monsters can climb ladders?

[4:09] <ZaxKellens> Lies
[4:09] <sorre> "Monsters and animals are not able to climb ladders" is struck, and replaced by "broken, presumed bugged."

[4:11] <Animator> You think monsters can climb ladders?
[4:11] <sorre> i don't know if monsters can climb ladders
[4:12] <sorre> the wiki is unclear on that

[4:12] <Kom> and I need a nice set of throwing knives
[4:12] <Kom> that would certainly be an interesting thing to put in, hehe.
[4:13] <vurtual> there should be an eater mob
[4:13] <Animator> We must experiment.
[4:13] <vurtual> he has no limbs
[4:13] <vurtual> just bodies
[4:13] <vurtual> and they all have mouths
[4:13] <vurtual> that eat entity blocks
[4:13] <Animator> Fractal, I'm promoting you to head Minecraft Scientist.
[4:13] <Fractal> yay!
[4:13] <ZaxKellens> =O
[4:13] <vurtual> and then eat normal blocks to chase you
[4:13] <Snowman> Why kids shouldn't be allowed to make youtube videos, let alone be on the internet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KergPNByFIE
[4:13] <ZaxKellens> Scientist!
[4:13] <Snowman> OH
[4:13] <Animator> Get your lab coat on. We're going to climb some monster ladders of science.
[4:13] <Snowman> I
[4:13] <Kom> my god
[4:13] <Fractal> Have you seen the lava trap in infdev? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YV9dunURGjA
[4:13] <Snowman> I'm the sceintist here :/
[4:13] <vede> lamesauce, furnace crashes the game.
[4:14] <Fractal> it runs on pigs!
[4:14] <Kom> I wish I could throw a grenade through this youtube window
[4:14] <ZaxKellens> Vede : Only if you save and leave when it's furnacing
[4:14] * Animator gets shades, and on the side is engraved, "e=mc^2, bitch."
[4:14] <vede> Yeah, Zax.
[4:14] <vede> That's what I did.
[4:14] <ZaxKellens> I found that crash once and ruined my awesome game T.T
[4:15] <ZaxKellens> Vede
[4:15] <ZaxKellens> You run into a bear trap! Roll for reflex save!
[4:15] <vede> Just lost a bunch of iron. :(
[4:15] <ZaxKellens> That stinks =\

[4:15] <ZaxKellens> Sorre : it's bugged at the moment
[4:16] <sorre> in what way?
[4:16] <sorre> i was aware that it didn't flow
[4:16] <sorre> what i've never noticed before is this weird grid stuff
[4:16] <ZaxKellens> Oh, yeah, doesn't flow and lava is overlapping it somehow
[4:16] <Fractal> Animator: Should the secret of fully functional lava traps be revealed, then?

[4:18] <Animator> Ohhhhh shit.
[4:18] <Fractal> I hope it is the kind of science you want
[4:18] <ZaxKellens> I don't get it
[4:18] <Snowman> lol, apple likes tiny letters
[4:18] <Animator> It is the kind of science that everyone must be aware of.
[4:18] <Animator> THIS NEEDS TO BE KNOWN TO THE WORLD.
[4:18] <Animator> Post a thread on it on the forums.
[4:18] <Snowman> Facetime requires iPhone 4 and Wi-Fi connection for both caller and recipient
[4:19] <vurtual> no no
[4:19] <Fractal> basically, combined with towers of sand, and furnace ceilings, it can sensibly make an inescapable deadly trap
[4:19] <Snowman> Wtf
[4:19] <vurtual> the IRC must keep these secret, Animator
[4:19] <Snowman> Apple is acting like they invented the webcam
[4:19] <vurtual> For we shall dominate the world with our advanced technology.
[4:19] <ZaxKellens> Death trap, bwhahaha
[4:20] <Fractal> I can't wait for mp infedv, that trap will rule the world, mwhahaha
[4:20] <ZaxKellens> Woh, what happened?
[4:20] <vurtual> You know what I want to create for MY forts?
[4:20] <vurtual> Blades.
[4:20] <ZaxKellens> How did the sand turn into...
[4:20] <vurtual> That come out of walls.
[4:20] <ZaxKellens> Wtf?
[4:20] <Snowman> FFS
[4:20] <Trapiki> Hmmm
[4:20] <Snowman> Apple needs to get it's head out of it's ass
[4:20] <Snowman> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHngLJ0RlNg
[4:20] <ZaxKellens> WHat just happened?
[4:20] <vurtual> If you manage to get past the two giant blades that come out of the walls
[4:20] <Trapiki> You only need to place ladders every second block to get up
[4:20] <Fractal> ZaxKellens: see the other videos, they help
[4:20] <vurtual> then you'll be walking in immediately-triggered iron spikes that thrust up and hurt you.
[4:20] <zaneo> I think it's too far stuck up there snowman
[4:20] <ZaxKellens> ...
[4:20] <vurtual> so far up, it came out of their mouth
[4:21] <vurtual> somehow

[4:41] <blaster> why?
[4:41] <Trapiki> People.
[4:42] <Trapiki> That's why
[4:42] <EmpiresBane> you have no idea what mp is going to be like
[4:42] <Jat> because nobody even knows exactly what mp survival is going to be like yet and these guilds are being formed ahead of time with a lot of expectations

[7:58] <EmpiresBane> Fleur, how would you transfer the energy back down?

[7:58] <Dysgalt> Empiresbane
[7:58] <Fleur> EmpiresBane: it gets converted into microwaves or something
[7:58] <slowriot> wait, what are we talking about?
[7:58] <Dysgalt> Microwaver lasers
[7:58] <TrueWolves> ...
[7:58] <Dysgalt> Japan is using that idea
[7:58] <EmpiresBane> that is a terrible idea...
[7:58] <TrueWolves> Fleur
[7:58] <Dysgalt> btw ping truewolves as much as possible
[7:58] <TrueWolves> How much do you know about the atmosphere?
[7:58] <slowriot> i vote we microwave australia
[7:58] <Dysgalt> Truewolves
[7:58] <Dysgalt> it will work
[7:58] <AndrewPH> falling microwaves holy shit
[7:58] <PuyoDead> It's only Siis and Notch.
[7:58] <Dysgalt> japanese said so :)
[7:58] <Dysgalt> ;v
[7:59] <TrueWolves> The atmosphere blocks preaty much everything that isn't radio or light.
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> you realize what that could be used for?
[7:59] <Fleur> TrueWolves: microwaves o.o
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> TrueWolves, with the right lasers, you can ionize the air
[7:59] <TrueWolves> Microwaves are blocked by the atmosphere Fleur
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> creating a 'tunnel' of sorts
[7:59] <TrueWolves> You could
[7:59] <Fleur> method of transmitting power over long distances (eg, from an SPS to the Earth's surface) using microwaves from a very large (up to one square kilometer) antenna on the satellite to a much larger one on the ground, now known as a rectenna.[3]
[7:59] <TrueWolves> but your no longer getting all the energy, your using a lot of it to get the rest.

[8:21] <Malikat> why kicked?
[8:22] <Malikat> they're really intuitive, darke
[8:22] <Malikat> doors are planks
[8:22] <Malikat> ladders are sticks
[8:22] <Fleur> Because I figured out how to make signs ladders and doors in the first three minutes I played after the update
[8:22] <Malikat> ^
[8:22] <darkedone02> damn, I was using planks on trying to make ladder...
[8:22] <darkedone02> but what about signs? logs?
[8:22] <darkedone02> wait!
[8:22] <darkedone02> i think i know

[8:36] <slowriot> seems to be the case right now
[8:36] <slowriot> you only get one plank block back
[8:36] <slowriot> not to mention having to knock out the floor under them to do so, which is then destroyed in the process... i don't think notch has thought that bit through
[8:36] <Dman757> Kinda lame but what ever
[8:37] <Dman757> Ladders are cool

[8:39] <Fleur> ladders make a great escape from enemie if your quick an build a bunch of ladder blocks go up to the top and delete a few farther down xD
[8:39] <Malikat> can enemies climb ladders?
[8:39] <Fleur> i dun know thas why i said delete some farther down
[8:39] <Malikat> ladders are expensive to make though
[8:39] <Dman757> Wiki says "broken, presumed bugged." for monsters not being able to climb.
[8:40] <Fleur> oic
[8:40] <outsomnia|> How do you delete the ones at the bottom if you're at the top and monsters are climbing?
[8:40] <slowriot> do monsters climb then?
[8:40] <Fleur> depends how it's build if you have a ledge near by or somethin
[8:41] <Fleur> im sure you could creatively make an escape using ladders
[8:42] <Dman757> Oh looks like you can use them if you even put a one block gap in between the ladders
[8:43] <slowriot> well yeah you can just jump between them
[8:43] <Dman757> No jumping it goes smooth
[8:43] <Dman757> Good thing even though they take a lot of materials is woods easy to come by.
[8:43] <Fleur> they make good wall decorations
[8:44] <TrueWolves> except hell
[8:44] <TrueWolves> Hell is the one time I use coal for fuel, becuase wood is vaulable
[8:44] <TrueWolves> becuase there are always monsters you need to fight for it.

[9:03] <Azathoth> hey guys, what's a good way to blend colors (RGB) together?
[9:03] <Azathoth> preferably by a percentage of each color
[9:03] <Azathoth> like 80% red and 20% blue
[9:04] <slowriot> with basic arithmetic
[9:05] <slowriot> what's 80% of 255, 0, and what's 20% of 255?
[9:05] <Azathoth> let's say you wanted an unweighted blend... it would just be an average of the color values right?
[9:05] * frogmella (Mibbit@S0106000d88bfc438.gv.shawcable.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:05] <slowriot> depends what you mean by "blend" since your monitor isn't a paint palette, you have three independent additive colours
[9:06] <Azathoth> i just need to alpha blend the colors or whatever
[9:06] <slowriot> so you can either take the total as 3x255
[9:06] <Azathoth> or not alpha
[9:06] <Azathoth> but... some kind of average i guess
[9:06] <Fleur> google?
[9:06] <slowriot> if you want 80% red plus 20% blue, that's 204,0,51
[9:07] <slowriot> in additive terms
[9:07] <slowriot> but that's % of each colour
[9:07] <slowriot> if you want % of total luminance, you can't get that without using some green if you see what i mean
[9:07] <Azathoth> i'd like to be able to define the final percentages
[9:07] * Kurimus (stabbity@dsl-tkubrasgw1-fe32dc00-253.dhcp.inet.fi) has joined #minecraft
[9:07] <Azathoth> or weights or something
[9:07] <slowriot> the maximum you can get of total luminance is 66.6. if you're using two colours - just add their hex values together
[9:08] <slowriot> you really need to define your problem better - you want to express the colours as a percentage of what?
[9:08] <Azathoth> i don't think i want an additive blend
[9:08] <Azathoth> ok well let me just get to the specific thing i'm trying to do
[9:08] <Azathoth> i'm making a simple day/night system and i need to get a color based on the time of the day
[9:09] <Azathoth> using certain "key" colors
[9:09] <slowriot> uh-huh
[9:09] * Tetsuoh (Mibbit@206-51-163-41.nktelco.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[9:09] <slowriot> so you want to interpolate between them or something?
[9:09] * Curt` (DorkeyDear@76.241.95.16) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[9:09] <Azathoth> so in the middle of the day the color needs to be like 100% light blue and in the night it needs to be 100% dark blue and i need to interpolate between them
[9:09] <Azathoth> yes
[9:09] <slowriot> so why not just interpolate between the numerical values
[9:10] <Azathoth> ...
[9:10] <slowriot> say you have blue=b1 at time=t1
[9:10] <slowriot> and blue=b2 at time=t2
[9:10] <Azathoth> that sounds kinda legit
[9:10] <slowriot> then blue value b at arbitrary time t is
[9:10] <Azathoth> ><
[9:12] <slowriot> b=((b2-b1)*((t-t1)/t2))+b1
[9:12] <slowriot> ow my head
[9:12] <slowriot> i may have got that wrong, it's after 6am here
[9:12] <slowriot> oh oh
[9:12] <slowriot> no
[9:13] <Azathoth> i can figure it out now
[9:13] <Azathoth> the idea to simply iterate between the colors or wahtever didn't even occur to me
[9:13] <Azathoth> i'm really out of it today
[9:13] <Azathoth> thanks ><
[9:13] <slowriot> having said that, a linear interpolation may not be what you want ;)
[9:13] <slowriot> i did something very similar a while ago actually, for a first person rpg i made
[9:13] <slowriot> let me see what values i used
[9:14] <slowriot> oh this is nice

[10:24] <sorre> it won't blow up on its own, so it just follows you around until you strike it

[10:33] <sorre> i always find myself wanting for a compass in infdev
[10:33] <Plinky> Can monsters climb ladders?

[10:34] <sorre> at the moment, yes
[10:34] <IDTL> oh god
[10:34] <sorre> at least, that's what the wiki implies

[11:30] <Plinky> Nice/
[11:31] <darkedone02> grim reaper came to collect the soul of the dead sim, I grabbed the meteorite and the other bits, and place them on my front yard XD

[11:34] <darkedone02> my sim was discusted... he did not cry or anything,
[11:34] <Malikat> wtf
[11:35] <slowriot> why do we care about your sims?
[11:35] <slowriot> it's not like they're dorfs or anything
[11:35] <Malikat> Pillbox: you can't cover all walls with ladders
[11:35] <Malikat> you can only have one ladder in each block
[11:35] <Malikat> you would need two in each block
[11:35] <Malikat> however, if you had four ladders placed appropriately
[11:36] <darkedone02> execise time and cereal
[11:36] <Malikat> i don't think you could fall
[11:36] * Darkfire002 (Mibbit@121.91.6.153) has joined #minecraft
[11:36] <Malikat> which would make for a great landing area since you could make a ring of ladders like that and then be able to jump down a shaft
[11:36] <Malikat> and not die no matter how deep it was
[11:36] <Darkfire002> Hi
[11:36] <slowriot> well, a ladder takes up its entire block
[11:36] <Darkfire002> Yes thats what im thinking!
[11:36] <slowriot> so in theory
[11:36] <Darkfire002> like a real quarry.
[11:36] <slowriot> you could have 100% coverage

[11:37] <Darkfire002> oh :(
[11:37] <Malikat> draining lakes is easy
[11:37] <Darkfire002> what happens to the lava?
[11:37] <Malikat> lava turns to stone
[11:37] <Pillbox> i just found out about the ladders
[11:38] <Pillbox> tis true
[11:38] <Darkfire002> yes
[11:38] <Malikat> found out what?
[11:38] <Darkfire002> also if you place a door on glass you get 2 doors.
[11:38] <Malikat> that you can't fall?
[11:38] <Pillbox> but with properly placed ladders, you cant place torches XD
[11:38] <Malikat> door on glass = two doors?
[11:38] <Pillbox> well, you can, but it would very difficult to die that way
[11:38] <Darkfire002> yes it douplicates and you get 2
[11:38] <Malikat> pillbox: you can make a drop shaft for that
[11:38] <Pillbox> drop shaft?
[11:38] <slowriot> ladders, torches, fire, etc - all mutually exclusive
[11:38] <Malikat> have a 2x2 shaft that is like 100 blocks deep
[11:39] <Darkfire002> a shaft going streight down
[11:39] <Darkfire002> yes
[11:39] <slowriot> because they're all real blocks
[11:39] <Pillbox> ah
[11:39] <Malikat> two blocks from the bottom, have a ring of ladders
[11:39] <Pillbox> that will work?
[11:39] <Malikat> as long as you don't land on top of any of the ladders
[11:39] <Malikat> it'll catch you and you won't die
[11:39] <Darkfire002> signs are pretty useless at the moment but once smp comes
[11:39] <Malikat> yeah, i've confirmed it
[11:39] <Pillbox> ive tried landing in that much water from great hights, and it didnt save me
[11:39] <Pillbox> was under the impression ladders used the same physics
[11:39] <Malikat> ladders don't just slow your fall, they limit it
[11:39] <Pillbox> or lack of as the case may be
[11:40] <Pillbox> oic
[11:40] <Darkfire002> 1 block of water saves you from any fall i think
[11:40] <Darkfire002> i know a big 50 m drop is stoped by 4 blocks
[11:40] <Malikat> as long as you can pass through the ladder square without hitting anything, it'll bring you completely down to the ladder descent speed
[11:40] <Malikat> 1 block of water won't save you from most lethal falls
[11:41] <Darkfire002> u need 2 right?
[11:41] <Malikat> two will save you from almost anything, everything if you're holding space when you hit
[11:41] <Pillbox> well, mebbe i forgot to hold space then
[11:41] <Malikat> one ladder can catch you from 120 blocks up
[11:41] <Pillbox> cause i tried that one time and went splat
[11:42] <Pillbox> jumped from top of map to sea level

[17:30] <Marach> what's the difference
[17:30] <Bodie> its usefull for knowing north

[17:30] <shairn> how do you craft doors ? :o
[17:31] <vurtual> it uses six wood

[17:48] <Ensirum> or is there an email for him?
[17:48] <Takos360> yes
[17:48] <Ensirum> i have ideas, but theyre a bit too intricate (albeit very simple) for slabbing on a forum
[17:48] <Ensirum> i cant be bothered with flame wars
[17:48] <Ensirum> where can i get the email?
[17:48] <Takos360> markus@mojang.com

[17:48] <Takos360> Yes
[17:48] <Takos360> xD
[17:48] <Ensirum> anyway, its about infdev, being INFINITE
[17:49] <slowriot> your face is infinite
[17:49] <Takos360> it already is :P
[17:49] <Ensirum> its not

[17:49] <Takos360> yeh, infinite
[17:49] <Takos360> :D
[17:49] <Ensirum> thats finite
[17:49] <Takos360> hehe i know
[17:49] <Ensirum> i believe it was 8million x 8million x 500?
[17:49] <Takos360> not that hard to make it infinite tho
[17:49] <Takos360> O_O
[17:49] <Takos360> omg.
[17:50] <Ensirum> i dunno takos, i think i read that

[17:50] <Ensirum> not quite infinite
[17:50] <Takos360> but you know
[17:50] <Ensirum> my idea will still be the same XYZ measurements

[17:51] <Takos360> well
[17:51] <lolcat> slowriot: pie?
[17:51] <Takos360> its abit over the clouds
[17:51] <Ensirum> but i believe 62556 ? or whatever
[17:51] <Takos360> a huge bit
[17:51] <Ensirum> well ive been to 13,000 on creative
[17:51] <Takos360> Heh
[17:52] <Ensirum> set a spawn, and watch people without WoM fall
[17:52] <Ensirum> takes so long to get down most of them just quit

[17:52] <Ensirum> plinky..
[17:52] <Plinky> But adjusted my height to 7777.7 :D
[17:52] <Ensirum> you didnt think.. ITS ALMOST OVER NINE THOUSAND!
[17:52] <Takos360> xD
[17:53] <Plinky> My old username is Eddy9007
[17:53] <Plinky> I get stuff like that enough
[17:53] <Ensirum> the other idea i have for minecraft
[17:53] <Ensirum> BUCKETS!!!
[17:53] <Takos360> already done
[17:53] <Ensirum> oh it has?
[17:53] <Plinky> Notch already has them planned.
[17:53] <Takos360> he has it in his planning sheet
[17:53] <Takos360> Hehe^^
[17:53] <Ensirum> my idea might already be implemented by notch
[17:53] <Ensirum> basically
[17:54] <Takos360> http://www.toodledo.com/views/public.php?id=td4b49fbf9c05a0
[17:54] <Ensirum> if you imagine a cube
[17:54] <Ensirum> it has 6 sides
[17:54] <Ensirum> roll that out
[17:54] <Ensirum> you have a cross
[17:54] <Ensirum> imagine if infdev was shaped in that style of map
[17:54] <Ensirum> HOWEVER
[17:54] <slowriot> lolcat: piecraft
[17:54] <Ensirum> if you cross the border, you go into the corresponding side
[17:54] <Takos360> hmm
[17:54] <Ensirum> so all notch has to do if set the fog to load in a circle raius
[17:54] <Ensirum> radius*
[17:55] <Ensirum> as soon as the radius crosses the border, boom! loaded
[17:55] <Takos360> well
[17:55] <slowriot> and what happens when you cross a corner on a diagonal?
[17:55] <vurtual> how about a full 3D globe
[17:55] <Takos360> not that good
[17:55] <Ensirum> so the world will have the illusion of being spherical
[17:55] <Ensirum> well slowriot
[17:55] <Takos360> then it isnt really infinite
[17:55] <Takos360> just repetitive
[17:55] <Ensirum> it would work
[17:55] <vurtual> that wraps
[17:55] <slowriot> ...
[17:55] <Ensirum> ^
[17:55] <lolcat> Craft Pie !!
[17:55] <vurtual> but is so big, you'll never see the curvature easily
[17:55] <vurtual> except if you get up on a cliff, you can see the curvature mildly.
[17:55] <slowriot> dysoncraft
[17:55] <Ensirum> slowriot. basically..
[17:55] <Plinky> Infdev does have an ending point doesn't it?
[17:55] * Chibiace (ace.dark@24-171-52-74.dhcp.stls.mo.charter.com) has joined #minecraft
[17:55] <Ensirum> get a box, and test my theory
[17:56] <Ensirum> crossing diagonally makes no difference
[17:56] <Ensirum> because when the box is closed
[17:56] <slowriot> where would the sun set?
[17:56] <Ensirum> you can cross properly
[17:56] * Chibiace (ace.dark@24-171-52-74.dhcp.stls.mo.charter.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[17:56] <Ensirum> well slow, imagine the cross
[17:56] <vurtual> Plinky, the laws of physics will sooner unravel than you find it.
[17:56] <Marach> i wonder is there is a *beep* server that simulates tiled map.
[17:56] <Plinky> Because nothing can be infinity and a program couldn't handle that.
[17:56] <Ensirum> the 4 boxes in a row
[17:56] <Ensirum> it croses over them
[17:56] <Plinky> infinite*
[17:56] <Ensirum> or, the 3 across
[17:56] <Ensirum> since that would be to theeast
[17:56] <Marach> loads a map file, makes a 3x3 grid out of it
[17:56] <Ensirum> lol
[17:56] <Marach> when player puts a block, it appears on all the "copies"
[17:57] <vurtual> you know what'd be a fun map
[17:57] <vurtual> one that's a block
[17:57] <Marach> and when you walk out of the middle square, it warps the player to the other end.
[17:57] <Marach> perfect.
[17:57] <Ensirum> hah
[17:57] <Ensirum> something else i wouldnt mind
[17:57] <vurtual> like, various compositions of soil and grass for a grass block map
[17:57] <Ensirum> however, i dont wanna say "levels"
[17:57] <vurtual> including tiny grass blades
[17:57] <Ensirum> i want mining proficiency
[17:57] * Smashing (Smashing@c-98-231-91-139.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[17:57] <Ensirum> so if youve mined like 40,000 blocks
[17:57] <Plinky> What about woodcutting proficiency
[17:57] <Ensirum> you dont need a pickaxe to mine stone
[17:57] <vurtual> notch says no ;_;
[17:58] <Ensirum> hes considered that?
[17:58] <Plinky> Ensirum, it'll just be like runescape.
[17:58] <Plinky> :P
[17:58] <Ensirum> thats why i said no levels
[17:58] <slowriot> Marach: not perfect
[17:58] <Ensirum> if we limited it to level of 3
[17:58] <slowriot> your view distance is only one square diagonal, tops
[17:58] <Ensirum> so it was simply people who are hardcore dont have to stay autistic
[17:58] <Marach> use fog
[17:58] <slowriot> unless i'm misunderstanding
[17:58] <Marach> it can be big
[17:58] <Marach> like 256x256
[17:58] <slowriot> that's not big
[17:58] <Takos360> Ideas are for notch to make, and you ppl can all fantasise about cool ideas for minecraft
[17:59] <Marach> you'd be surprised
[17:59] <Takos360> but if you dont Make them yourself and show him he wont take them

[17:59] <Takos360> i mean, not make the idea, i ment like really build the idea

[18:00] <Marach> OMg tacled.
[18:00] <Ensirum> actually. brb i need to test something
[18:00] <Takos360> :P
[18:01] <Ensirum> right
[18:02] <Takos360> i wish notch would make Crouching pretty soon
[18:02] <Takos360> he has it planned
[18:02] <vurtual> no, rolling
[18:02] <Ensirum> ha..
[18:02] <Takos360> lol...
[18:02] <Ensirum> right, i worked out how to do this infdev thing
[18:02] <Ensirum> im gonna mail it to notch, and hopefully he wont hate my guts
[18:02] <vurtual> you hold down ctrl, and move, then you roll forward really fast for a few seconds, and you can roll in directions
[18:02] <Ensirum> it shouldnt be to complicated
[18:02] <vurtual> then stop rolling and stand up
[18:02] <Ensirum> but. it could get complicated
[18:02] <vurtual> so you could roll under a falling wall of fire, or under a wall
[18:03] <Takos360> riiiight
[18:03] <Takos360> no.
[18:03] <Ensirum> yeah
[18:03] <Ensirum> it sounds a bit gay
[18:03] <Ensirum> sorry vurtual
[18:03] <Takos360> dont be sorry
[18:03] <Takos360> he deserves it
[18:03] <Takos360> :D
[18:03] <Ensirum> lol, bit harsh
[18:03] <Takos360> you should hear him every day
[18:03] <Takos360> he just goes on and on and on and on
[18:03] <Ensirum> hahah
[18:03] <Takos360> ^^

[18:10] <Ten_Tacles> I had a better idea of how to climb ladders.
[18:10] <Ten_Tacles> :D
[18:11] <vurtual> I heard half-life
[18:11] <vurtual> I'm here
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> But its a bit more complicated.
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> Lols
[18:11] <vurtual> also ladders would be better if you like
[18:11] <vurtual> walk against them to move
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> Hm
[18:11] <vurtual> and if you're looking up, you go up
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> Na
[18:11] <vurtual> looking down, go down
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> Right click them
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> And you are attached to them
[18:11] <vurtual> like half-life
[18:11] <slowriot> http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100302194634AA7EA5Q
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> And move up with w and down with s
[18:11] <vurtual> and you stick to them if you walk on them for more than a moment
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> Or so
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> Hm
[18:11] <Ten_Tacles> Thats good too.
[18:11] <vurtual> walking down it and off will result in you detaching, or jumping.

[18:13] <vurtual> If you're in the ladder's climb-area, walking against any wall will make you go up them
[18:13] <vurtual> and then you sink down if not going up
[18:13] <Ten_Tacles> Uh Yeah
[18:13] <Ten_Tacles> Hm
[18:13] <Ten_Tacles> I like my idea too :D
[18:14] <Ten_Tacles> Changing the direction you move with the keys
[18:14] <vurtual> I'd rather just have not falling, maybe only the ladder-surface, and going in the direction you look.
[18:14] <SnowmanHTC> I want it how the source engine does.
[18:14] <vurtual> while using S would reverse it
[18:14] <vurtual> so if you walked up against it while looking down and away, you'd go up
[18:15] <Ten_Tacles> :D
[18:15] <Ten_Tacles> Maybe we should make a list of ladder movement thing.
[18:15] <Ten_Tacles> *things
[18:15] <Snowman> Up
[18:15] <Snowman> DOwn
[18:15] <vurtual> I'd also like ladders working like tracks a bit

[18:16] <slowriot> unless you climb or descend
[18:16] <vurtual> nothing!
[18:16] <slowriot> it's not like ladders are new to first person games
[18:16] <cheezychicken> Caused by: java.util.zip.ZipException: invalid LOC header (bad signature)
[18:16] <vurtual> Except Notch didn't do that!
[18:16] <cheezychicken> in infdecv
[18:16] <Seif> it seems to use the same mechanics as when you're in water
[18:16] <Seif> so you sink
[18:16] <vurtual> You know how metroid fusion had climbable ceiling parts?
[18:16] <slowriot> i've fallen off tall ladders dozens of times since he implemented it because of the damn sinking thing
[18:17] <vurtual> That'd be fun in minecraft, climbing along ceilings over gaps that mobs can't chase you with.

[18:17] <slowriot> he doesn't really look... athletic enough
[18:18] <slowriot> with his big stupid cube arms and lack of elbow and knee joints, it's a miracle he can even swing a pickaxe
[18:18] <slowriot> let alone climb shit
[18:18] <Demki> sometimes when I right/left click, it minecraft loses focus and pauses the game.
[18:18] <Demki> without the it*
[18:19] <slowriot> without the sentence making sense either?
[18:19] <cheezychicken> ok, howabout this: I'm having a problem with infdev, it never loads. I have an error in my java console of "Caused by: java.util.zip.ZipException: invalid LOC header (bad signature)". can anyone assist me in fixing this?
[18:19] <ZomBuster> horizontal ladder = rail tracks

[18:20] <slowriot> Demki: this is a problem? I thought you were bragging

[18:21] <slowriot> are you running it in fullscreen?

[18:22] <Ten_Tacles> On bay12games they are always talking about pokemon... WTF

[18:44] <Plinky> This just makes me want to try infdev and indev. You guys suck.
[18:44] <copyboy> nargh ..
[18:44] <Plinky> Copyboy, TF2 is good.
[18:44] <copyboy> i KNOW
[18:44] <Demki> You know, 2 hours ago I almost broke my head
[18:45] <copyboy> that's why i play it that much
[18:45] <Plinky> Clever Demki.
[18:45] <Plinky> Copyboy, I need the shiv.
[18:45] <Plinky> Then I'll have all the sniper stuff.
[18:45] <copyboy> i got it
[18:45] <Plinky> :D
[18:45] <copyboy> i think i have all the items
[18:45] <Plinky> I don't.
[18:45] <ZomBuster> shiv is cool
[18:45] <copyboy> (not hats, ofc)
[18:45] <Plinky> Don't have the crit-a-cola.
[18:45] <Demki> It was because of this: http://www.mojang.com/notch/logichex/
[18:45] <ZomBuster> makes me go into suicidal rage sometimes
[18:45] <Plinky> Or the ubersaw.
[18:46] <ZomBuster> MUST MAKE PEOPLE BLEED! (runs into overhealed heavy)
[18:46] <Plinky> I have the Scotsman's Stove Pipe.
[18:46] <Plinky> It was a good drop.
[18:46] <Plinky> And I went O.O

[18:48] <Demki> bye nau!
[18:48] <copyboy> no wait
[18:48] <copyboy> i crafted my KGBs
[18:49] <copyboy> that's the only item i don't have yet
[18:49] <Demki> I made a stupid sign: "Dig her and die~!!!"
[18:49] <Demki> ~ = line break
[18:49] <Plinky> I accidently crafted a Blutsauger rather than a kritzkrieg, then a kritzkrieg dropped.
[18:49] <Plinky> And I'm just thinking... WHY GOD?
