[1:35] <blaster> When ever I see hur dur I read it as murder
[1:35] <LuciferZ> Make a valid argument for it then
[1:35] <Azathoth> they weren't just needlessly bashing it
[1:35] <Dommys> It's gorgeous
[1:35] <Dommys> And Breathtaking
[1:35] * blaster backs away from flame war
[1:35] <Azathoth> i'm inclined to agree with them somewhat
[1:35] <ILM> I like infdev, but at the same time, I'd rather a really really really nice small map, as opposed to a giant map with a few good spots
[1:35] <ATM> o hey blaster
[1:35] <Miclee> Dommys, we're not talking about how it looks.
[1:35] <LuciferZ> The generator could be implemented in standard, limited maps
[1:35] <ATM> i remember you

[1:36] <Dommys> Shut up if you don't want to contribute Miclee

[1:49] <Azathoth> yes
[1:49] <Siiseli> and ifh e doesn't post updates all the time or has something else to do he's abandoning the rpoject?

[3:08] <blaster> I know
[3:08] <Yourself> i do like space games
[3:08] <Flesh[MST3K]> think x3
[3:08] <blaster> but once it is,,,, that will be my reaction
[3:08] <Flesh[MST3K]> except blocks
[3:08] <Azathoth> space games are sexy
[3:08] <Yourself> and before anyone says anything, minecraft in space is a stupid idea
[3:08] <Azathoth> ^
[3:08] <blaster> Space games are indeed sexy
[3:08] <Malikat> space trading done right
[3:09] <Flesh[MST3K]> has anyone played X3: Terran conflict?
[3:09] <blaster> If you could take over planets once your powerful enough
[3:09] <blaster> peacefuly or with violence
[3:09] <Azathoth> i've played the original X3 (terran conflict is the expansion right?)
[3:09] <blaster> that would be simply awsome

[3:10] <Flesh[MST3K]> much bigger galaxy/more ships etc
[3:10] <Azathoth> i love X3, but it gets pretty dull
[3:10] <vurtual> I've been idling around
[3:10] <Azathoth> and it's too easy to wander into a band of pirates that just tear you apart :S
[3:10] <vurtual> brb outside
[3:10] <Flesh[MST3K]> thats why you build up a fleet of ships

[3:12] * blaster wishes you could use mining lazorz on enemy ships

[3:12] <Malikat> so once i flood an area with water
[3:12] <Malikat> and cut off the connection to the river
[3:12] <Malikat> i need a way to unflood it, don't i?
[3:12] <Azathoth> uh
[3:12] <Vis{err}> Time shift is great but I fail at it
[3:12] <Vis{err}> GTAIV is OK; haven't played much
[3:12] <Vis{err}> JC2 is amazing; get it
[3:12] <Vis{err}> ME2 is amazing; get it
[3:12] <Azathoth> is any of the water below ... 3/7?
[3:12] <Yourself> if you want to unflood it, yes, you need a way to unflood it
[3:13] <Azathoth> or is it 2?
[3:13] <blaster> ME2 had the RPG elements kidnapped by french canadian terrorists
[3:13] <Yourself> i was happy with the changes they made to ME2
[3:13] <Azathoth> i don't think mass effect is meant to conform to any one genre
[3:13] <Azathoth> so it's a little unfair to compare the series to an rpg alone
[3:13] <Yourself> the amount of time i had to waste in ME1 turning garbage into omni-gel was ridiculous
[3:14] <Azathoth> and i was happy with ME2 too
[3:14] <Yourself> especially since i practically never used it

[3:14] * bombadil (madMonkey@S01060012172da1d3.wp.shawcable.net) has joined #minecraft
[3:14] <Malikat> i think it will be less than 3
[3:14] <Malikat> i'm not sure though! D:
[3:14] <Azathoth> because water evaporates eventually if it's below a certain level
[3:14] <liq3> Malikat: depend son how deep it is.
[3:14] <Azathoth> but i don't remember what
[3:14] <liq3> Azathoth: I htink it's 4?...
[3:15] <liq3> It evaporates REALLY solwly tho unless it's 3 or less.
[3:15] <Vis{err}> Grooveshark is a bitch about me uploading
[3:15] <Vis{err}> I've tried uploading a track like eight fucking times
[3:15] <Yourself> if i have to flood an area for mud i always create a holding tank that will result in at most 1 water per tile when the tank is emptied
[3:15] <Vis{err}> it says "done"
[3:15] <Vis{err}> and it doesn't appear; not even after the designated 24 hrs.
[3:15] <ClassiestMedic> I have a nest of baby birdies on a wreath right by my front door :D
[3:15] <Azathoth> also, doesn't water evaporate if it's exposed to air and less than 7?
[3:15] <Azathoth> or something
[3:16] <blaster> Since none of ya guessed I am gona tell ya who I would of voted for. Conservative
[3:16] <Azathoth> g4u blaster
[3:16] <Yourself> it's also related to temperature
[3:16] <Yourself> wtf is blaster talking about?
[3:16] <Malikat> uh oh
[3:16] <Malikat> someone is throwing a tantrum D:
[3:16] <Azathoth> who he voted for in the uk erections
[3:16] <Azathoth> malikat, who?
[3:16] <liq3> Malikat: oh checking the wiki, only 1/7 water evaporates.
[3:16] <Yourself> oh, i don't care about that
[3:16] <Azathoth> exactly
[3:17] <liq3> So any room you want to evaporate needs at least one constant 1/7 tile. :/
[3:17] <blaster> Malikat, find out why
[3:17] <Flesh[MST3K]> dorfs can walk in 3/7 easily though
[3:17] <blaster> And fix the issue
[3:17] <blaster> By building statues
[3:17] <liq3> Flesh[MST3K]; doesn't help if you wanna build there.
[3:17] <liq3> :p
[3:17] <Flesh[MST3K]> true dat
[3:17] <blaster> Also throw him in a nice engraved jail with a 1 tile booze stockpile
[3:17] <Azathoth> just let it flow out into your fortress
[3:17] <Azathoth> it will get to 1/7 eventually :P
[3:18] <Malikat> oh god! D: there's immigrants
[3:18] <Azathoth> i hope they have their documents
[3:18] <liq3> rofl....
[3:18] <Azathoth> stop them at the border to make sure

[3:19] <Visiiri> If you've checked them out before, you haven't heard "forest ruins" yet, as I just threw that up.
[3:19] <Azathoth> grooveshark doesn't seem to work for me
[3:19] <Malikat> wtf damnit!
[3:19] <Malikat> DAMNIT
[3:19] <Visiiri> Do as I say; Check out my GrooveShark
[3:19] <Malikat> i NEED THIS CHANNEL DUG

[3:20] <Malikat> i was fishing, i started gathering plants, and i can't figure out how to get hunting to work
[3:20] <liq3> From the sounds of it, your fort is gonna reach the ultimate fun soon. :]
[3:20] <Visiiri> The Minecraft Forums contains multiple forums
[3:20] <Visiiri> it's not Minecraft Forum
[3:20] <Visiiri> even though that'd be right.
[3:20] <Azathoth> what happens if you starve all your dorfs? do they just leave? or do they go crazy and cannibalistic?
[3:20] * Visiiri is a whiney bitch
[3:20] <liq3> Azathoth: probably start starving to death... Then the tantrum spiral starts.
[3:21] * Visiiri sets topic to: Visiiri's Music!
[3:21] <liq3> Your entire fort quickly devolves into choas and everyone dies, either from tantruming dwarves or starving.
[3:21] * Azathoth sets topic to: Visiiri's Music! ... is shit
[3:21] <Visiiri> D:
[3:21] <Visiiri> wtf man
[3:21] <Visiiri> you said grooveshark didn't work
[3:21] <Azathoth> liq3, they don't eat each other? :[
[3:21] <Visiiri> You haven't even heard the songs, and they're epic.

[3:22] <Azathoth> i eat motherfuckers
[3:22] <vurtual> preform drastic actions to obtain food
[3:22] <vurtual> maybe go crazy
[3:22] <Azathoth> like i said... cannibalism!

[3:35] <Budda> derp
[3:36] <Malikat> and monitors have had native resolutions higher than 1080 for a long time

[5:57] <vurtual> Which has a one-way wall that acts as a ceiling for the lower half. Walls move up and down in it, creating a random maze that shifts constantly.
[5:57] <vurtual> It's confusing enough, but with some hunters, it's even better.
[5:57] <Konogan> Truewolves, look awesome.
[5:58] <PuyoDead> If it were my image, sure.
[5:58] <vurtual> Now I'm going to prank my friend with it, using the random maze to hide random goodies and traps.
[5:58] <Visiiri> Ah.
[5:58] <Visiiri> Well, ME2 is BILLIONS of miles
[5:58] <PuyoDead> Does space count?
[5:58] <Visiiri> Course
[5:58] <Visiiri> Otherwise it would only be about 2 miles.
[5:59] <Visiiri> I'm adding everything in the game you can play on.
[5:59] <vurtual> daggerfall is mindblowingly huge
[5:59] <vurtual> Visiiri, super mario 64 takes place between dimensions
[5:59] <Konogan> Is there a way to remove that bar google placed on the left? I kind of hate it...
[5:59] <vurtual> and super mario galaxy takes place between many GALAXIES
[5:59] <vurtual> ME2 has nothing on SMG
[6:00] <Visiiri> Super Mario Galaxy does, you're right.
[6:00] <Visiiri> but ME2 has a larger PLAY space.
[6:00] <vurtual> daggerfall wins either way
[6:01] <Firetempest> but you don't interact with that empty space at all, except the glorified hallways that take you planet to planet
[6:01] <Skybreaker> haha, wut
[6:01] <Skybreaker> ?

[6:05] <Firetempest> wow... just wow
[6:05] <Shadaez> i doubt rage will come on a hard drive
[6:05] <Shadaez> and I doubt it will be that big
[6:06] <vurtual> uncompressed, 1TB.
[6:06] <vurtual> compressed it'll probably fit on a CD still
[6:06] <Shadaez> they're likely getting the huge number based on uncompressed audio, uncompressed textures, tos of assets that will be unused in the final game
[6:06] <Shadaez> and etc
[6:06] <vurtual> It'd be funny to actually buy a game on a hard drive
[6:06] <Azathoth> if i had to buy games on hard drives, i'd rage
[6:06] <Konogan> Rofl.
[6:06] <Firetempest> makes more sense then buying a game with a giant 100 button custom remote
[6:06] <vurtual> You could just plug and play a game
[6:07] <Azathoth> aren't external drives pretty slow?
[6:07] <Azathoth> or at least the usb connection?
[6:07] <vurtual> not that bad anymore
[6:07] <Konogan> not if you got USB 3.0
[6:07] <Azathoth> there's a 3.0? :o
[6:07] <Konogan> Yup.
[6:08] <Shadaez> it's not that bad

[6:09] <Azathoth> i'd rather just get an internal SATA drive for like half as much
[6:09] <PuyoDead> Or just buy an enclosure.
[6:09] <Konogan> In fact an external HDD is less expensive than an internal Hard drive.
[6:09] <Firetempest> depends on size and speed. how if you want expensive. Solid state drives...
[6:10] <PuyoDead> Konogan, what country do you live in?
[6:10] <Konogan> Canada :P

[6:12] <Azathoth> i only have one more hard drive slot in my case, so i'm going to hold off until i need a new hard drive
[6:12] <Firetempest> what site do you shop?
[6:12] <Azathoth> by that time they'll be like 10 tb for $100
[6:13] <PuyoDead> Either newegg or microcenter.

[6:13] <Konogan> Seriously, I seen external 1tb at like 70$ and when I wanted to buy a 1tb internal for my pc it costed me 110$ :P
[6:13] <Azathoth> actually, if games came on their own storage device, that would be pretty fuckin awesome

[6:23] <Firetempest> thats why i dont have high hopes of a cross breed of gravity gun and portal gun in episode 3
[6:23] <PuyoDead> Something metroid/castlevania style?
[6:23] <vurtual> and how in the later area, you were in catwalks over the other one?
[6:23] <Azathoth> hmm
[6:23] <Azathoth> metroidvania
[6:24] <PuyoDead> (in terms on gameplay, not style)
[6:24] <vurtual> bts areas in portal 2 being like prime 2.
[6:24] <Konogan> delicious metroidvania...
[6:24] <PuyoDead> Either way, again, the portal gun would break that completely.

[6:56] <Scrippy> Sorry, I meant
[6:56] <Scrippy> >Implying IRC is loud
[6:56] <Azathoth> lol
[6:57] <vurtual> WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SOUND-PLAYING ADS
[6:57] <vurtual> THAT JUST WAIT
[6:57] <vurtual> FOR HOURS
[6:57] <Azathoth> nnnnooooooscript
[6:57] <vurtual> UNTIL FINALLY PLAYING
[6:57] <kinkos8> -whispers- Ah, I see. Goodbye world and all who inhabir it.
[6:57] <vurtual> These are illegal!
[6:58] <vede> vurtual, worse are the ones that are like "Oh! You moused over me! You must want to hear the shitty music I'm advertising! HERE, I'LL PLAY IT FOR YOU"
[6:58] <vurtual> no the ones who do it automatically
[6:58] <Scrippy> No
[6:58] <Scrippy> The worst are the ones
[6:58] <vurtual> and occour in the page
[6:58] <Scrippy> When I'm sitting here listeing to my post-rock
[6:58] <vurtual> taking up the entire screen space
[6:58] <vurtual> no x, large video
[6:58] <vurtual> rapes your cnonection
[6:58] <Deveak> damn am i the onyl one with a lighting issue? when i sue half blocks the upper part turns black if theirs a gap between it and the ceiling and when it turns night to day mined blocks turn black perfectly black
[6:58] <vurtual> plays LOUD sound
[6:58] <vede> Yeah, I hate those.
[6:58] <Scrippy> And all of a sudden I hear an ad for cooking
[6:58] <Scrippy> But the problem is
[6:58] <vurtual> and there's no way to click out of it
[6:59] <vede> Like "SHABLAM HEY YOU CAN'T VIEW THIS SITE TILL THIS AD IS OVER"
[6:59] <vurtual> since their size is like 9999999999 in invisible border
[6:59] <Scrippy> Most of the music I listen to is hipster bullshit full of speech samples
[6:59] <vurtual> and the site doesn't choose them there
[6:59] <vurtual> they just occour
[6:59] <vurtual> hehehe, two zombies got trapped in a tiny room
[6:59] <Scrippy> And sometimes I can't tell if it's an ad, or if the artists of the song are just being ironic.
[6:59] <Malikat> aw fuck
[6:59] <vurtual> and there's a guy who was fighting them, waiting in a tiny room
[6:59] <Scrippy> Virtual: Leave them there.
[6:59] <vurtual> I am
[6:59] <vurtual> I'm watching from above
[6:59] <Scrippy> Indev?
[6:59] <Malikat> i forgot to make sure there were any dwarves in my reservior before i started filling it. <__<
[6:59] <vurtual> The walls around the guy are going down
[6:59] <Scrippy> Heee.
[6:59] <vurtual> they'll start fighting soon
[6:59] <vurtual> no, a hl2 map
[6:59] <Scrippy> Ah

[7:00] <Malikat> IT ADDS SEASONING
[7:00] <Scrippy> My doctor is apparenty my military commander's wife.
[7:00] <vurtual> nope the zombies are there
[7:00] <Scrippy> I thought it was appropriate.
[7:00] <vurtual> but the one wall between this guy
[7:00] <vurtual> is stil there
[7:00] <vurtual> just a wall, in a huge room, and nobody can see him
[7:00] <Deveak> takes a while doesnt revert until its either full ngith ro day

[7:24] <liq3> vurtual: wut?
[7:24] <EmpiresBane> i've been considering getting an android phone
[7:24] <vurtual> Yes, let's disguise the platforms as SPIKY THINGS. This will obviously confuse a posessing creature wh ocan just go around.
[7:25] <vurtual> or possess a shark. Or you.
[7:25] <Deveak> plus what do you mean?
[7:25] <liq3> trees regrow automatically now?
[7:25] <EmpiresBane> do you guys think i should get one?

[7:46] <vede> And Kawa, I've been trying to get a job for about half a year now. You know how many places there are within walking distance from me? About three.
[7:47] <Deveak> on the ts
[7:47] <Konogan> I have a job, but it sucks. It's like from 12:30 to 4 AM.
[7:47] <AndrewPH> vede, anything's within walking distance
[7:47] <Konogan> :P
[7:47] <vede> That means about twenty people here have jobs, and the rest have to go out of town to do anything. Note that I can't get out of town because I have no mode of transportation because I have no money because... I can't get a job.
[7:47] <AndrewPH> only three places are in a reasonable walking distance though
[7:47] <Azathoth> vede, how old are you?
[7:48] <vede> Sixteen.
[7:48] <Azathoth> i took you for someone older
[7:48] <AndrewPH> vede, get a #minecrafter to keep you
[7:48] <AndrewPH> not me
[7:48] <AndrewPH> our dairy queen has enough people
[7:48] <AndrewPH> you could always rob a bank
[7:49] <Konogan> ^
[7:49] <AndrewPH> or 2
[7:49] <Konogan> ^^
[7:49] <Azathoth> or kill your parents in their sleep
[7:49] <Konogan> ^^^
[7:49] <Azathoth> it's what i did... resulted in me getting free food and a place to stay until i turned 18
[7:50] <Azathoth> wasn't the best food or accomodations, but it was free
[7:50] <Konogan> Azathoth got the trick.
[7:51] <Firetempest> ok, JC2 is fun. specially blowing out tires at high speed. if only the passengers where catapulted after the 3ed flip would it have been perfect

[9:31] <Lachrymosa> ok kewl, and i just figured out how to workbench
[9:31] <Azathoth> basically if it takes you a really long time to mine something, you're probably not going to get the ore from it so try with a better pickaxe
[9:31] <BadManiac> I might be slightly addicted to infdev... What can I do?

[10:03] <eritz> actually, charter was kind enough to only give me 864kB/s down tonight, when i needed to pull down a full copy of L4D2
[10:03] <Azathoth> poor babby
[10:03] <Azathoth> oh, and any time i called their customer service they were always like "have you tried resetting your router?"
[10:03] <eritz> well, thanks to the delay that caused, all my friends went to bed before i was ready to play
[10:03] <Azathoth> hah
[10:03] <eritz> shortly after they all left, i started getting 2.4MB/s again
[10:04] <Azathoth> it was a conspiracy
[10:04] <Azathoth> they didn't want to play with you, but they didn't want to hurt your feelings either
[10:04] <eritz> actually, they asked me to play
[10:04] <Azathoth> so they hacked your computer and made it secretly download gigs of hardcore fetish porn in the background to slow your internet
[10:05] <Azathoth> and they only asked you to play so you wouldn't feel left out
[10:05] <eritz> in order for that to work, i would have to not be doing that already
[10:05] <Azathoth> oh
[10:05] <Azathoth> well
[10:05] <Azathoth> there you go!
[10:06] <eritz> could also be that charter temporarily throttled me because i was torrenting like the fist of the north star all day long
[10:06] <Azathoth> it could also be that you touch yourself at night

[12:21] <EmpiresBane> penumbra has terrible graphics
[12:21] <EmpiresBane> their not just bad, their distraactingly bad
[12:21] <AndrewPH> EmpiresBane, I don't think so
[12:21] <AndrewPH> They certainly aren't crysis
[12:21] <AndrewPH> but they aren't that bad for an indie game
[12:22] <EmpiresBane> i had giant squares moving around on the ground
[12:22] <EmpiresBane> and there were some sections that rendered terribly
[12:22] <Malikat> their
[12:22] <EmpiresBane> what?
[12:23] <Malikat> your grammar isn't just bad, it's distraactingly bad.
[12:23] <EmpiresBane> maybe it's just my computer....
[12:23] <EmpiresBane> there was the right choice

[12:29] <EmpiresBane> i only ever played oblivion on the xbox
[12:29] <AndrewPH> EmpiresBane, xbox uses high
[12:29] <EmpiresBane> ok...
[12:29] <AndrewPH> highest pc setting is one step up
[12:29] <EmpiresBane> the faces in oblivion were one oof the creepiest things i've ever seen
[12:30] <AndrewPH> yeah
[12:31] <EmpiresBane> thyhey tried making them tooo realistic. and the wondering eyes were just weird
[12:31] <EmpiresBane> they never looked directly at you
[12:31] <AndrewPH> Oblivion's still fun
[12:31] <AndrewPH> :v
[12:31] <AndrewPH> Morrowind is more fun imo
[12:32] <AndrewPH> harder to get into
[12:32] <quaxar> morrowind is better than oblivion
[12:32] <quaxar> Thats for sure

[12:44] <Rithiur> I wonder if we'll soon reach a point where improving the graphical quality is no longer feasible technology and/or cost wise.
[12:45] <AndrewPH> Nope
[12:45] <AndrewPH> We'll soon reach a point where it's impossible to improve it
[12:45] <AndrewPH> as in it's too good
[12:45] <AndrewPH> and nothing will ever be better
[12:46] <EmpiresBane> in the future, we'll compllain about the graphics of reality
[12:46] <Rithiur> Here's a philosophical question: Can rendered graphics look better than reality?
[12:46] <AndrewPH> Rithiur, They can look the same
[12:46] <AndrewPH> but they can't look better
[12:46] <AndrewPH> well technically they can
[12:46] <AndrewPH> it all depends on the user
[12:46] <Parthon> it could look better, but how could we tell?
[12:46] <AndrewPH> ^
[12:46] <Parthon> often graphics that end up better than reality end up looking fake
[12:47] <EmpiresBane> that's not really philosophical, though...
[12:47] <Parthon> but then you have to ask yourself "what is the purpose of graphics?" .. especially considering we all play minecraft
[12:47] <Parthon> a game which isn't that realistic graphics wise
[12:49] <Bodie> i dont believe good graphics are necessary
[12:49] <Bodie> they're sometimes nice
[12:50] <Bodie> like, in gta4. the ragdoll effects wouldnt be nearly as funny if the models didnt look kinda realistic
[12:50] <EmpiresBane> graphics are just a form of displaying information
[12:50] <AndrewPH> Bodie, yeah they would
[12:50] <Bodie> no
[12:50] <Bodie> no they wouldnt
[12:50] <AndrewPH> sumotori is proof of that
[12:50] <AndrewPH> yes
[12:50] <AndrewPH> yes they would
[12:50] <Bodie> retard
[12:50] <Bodie> sumotori is fun
[12:50] <AndrewPH> herpepdperpe
[12:50] <Bodie> and yeah, it still gets a point across
[12:50] <AndrewPH> trying to troll me is like trying to give birth to yourself
[12:51] <AndrewPH> it just doesn't happen
[12:51] <Bodie> i'm not trolling you
[12:51] <AndrewPH> <Bodie> retard
[12:51] <AndrewPH> mhm
[12:51] <Bodie> thats stating a fact

[12:52] <Rithiur> Out of curiousity, how old are you people?
[12:52] <Parthon> 78
[12:52] <Bodie> 22
[12:53] <Parthon> nah, I'm 30
[12:53] <Bodie> they're there to help immerse us in the games
[12:53] <Rithiur> I just sometimes wonder how well will never generations adopt older graphics? I mean, how many of people, say older than 20 can tolerate worst graphics just because we grew up with them.
[12:53] <Rithiur> *newer
[12:53] <Malikat> i am 12 and what is this?
[12:54] <Bodie> i grew up with some older games, and i find some of them hard to play
[12:54] <Bodie> due to graphics
[12:54] <Bodie> although i like to think they dont matter :P
[12:54] <Parthon> yeah, but that could just be bad graphics
[12:54] <Roadcrosser> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0jZzBEKIMc
[12:54] <Bodie> it all depends on the kind of game too i guess
[12:54] <Roadcrosser> I love Minecraft
[12:54] <EmpiresBane> graphics do matter
[12:55] <Parthon> EmpiresBane: but why do they matter?
[12:55] <Bodie> if gameplay is good enough, and doesnt need graphics to show you whats happening, it can still be fun
[12:55] <Bodie> text based games can still be fun
[12:55] <Bodie> its just harder
[12:55] <EmpiresBane> because they filter how you experience the world
[12:55] <Bodie> harder to immerse you
[12:55] <Bodie> mmh
[12:56] <EmpiresBane> the realism of the graphics isn't the point
[12:56] <EmpiresBane> they must match the style of the game
[12:56] <Bodie> but like
[12:56] <Bodie> if you shoot a stick man in the face
[12:56] <EmpiresBane> otherwise, it takes you out of the experience
[12:56] <Bodie> you probably wont cringe, or care
[12:56] <Parthon> graphics are there to create an experience and present the symbols of the game for the player to interact with
[12:56] <Bodie> if you shoot a photorealistic woman in the face
[12:56] <Bodie> you're more likely to cringe
[12:56] <EmpiresBane> or laugh...
[12:57] <Bodie> well yeah, but its more likely to create an emotional response
[12:57] <Rithiur> I find it interesting, that techincal graphical quality is not in direct correlation with how well the graphics actually work. I mean, I tried to play Dungeon Siege 2 a while ago but was really put off by the graphics, but I find no problem, with something like Minecraft.
[12:57] <Parthon> that's why do many games try for realism nowadays, because they are a set of symbols that the player is already familiar with
[12:57] <Bodie> older games were trying to look really fancy
[12:57] <Bodie> even though they couldnt
[12:58] <Bodie> minecraft is purposely looking oldish
[12:58] <AndrewPH> I'm 15
[12:58] <Bodie> well, simple
[12:58] <AndrewPH> I love doom and such
[12:58] <Bodie> everyone loves doom
[12:58] <Parthon> but it still provides a high level of information
[12:58] <Bodie> its great
[12:58] <Parthon> you can tell what a spider, skeleton, tree, etc are easily
[12:58] <Bodie> mmh
[12:59] <Bodie> you arent doing anything that requires them to be anything more than basic block shapes
[12:59] <Bodie> the only thing i find limiting is the combat
[12:59] <Bodie> its rather unsatisfying hitting a monster
[12:59] <EmpiresBane> that's because there really isn't any
[12:59] <Parthon> that's a gameplay issue more than a graphics issue
[12:59] <Malikat> it's more effective to try to do something easy with great resources instead of trying to do something hard with fewer resources.
[13:00] <Bodie> its a style issue
[13:00] <Malikat> thus minecraft, easy graphics, great resources vs early games that tried too hard
[13:00] <Rithiur> Malikat: Aye. There's certain sense of appeal in minimalism.
[13:00] <Parthon> Rithiur: it's interesting that you mention DS2 actually :P
[13:01] <Bodie> i liked in DS2 how you could choose different ways to go on your quests
[13:01] <Bodie> my water tastes like deturgent but i keep drinking it
[13:02] <MarkTraceur> Bodie: That can't be healthy
[13:02] <Parthon> then stop drinking kitchen water
[13:02] <Bodie> but i
[13:02] <Bodie> i
[13:02] <Bodie> the kitchen is so far
[13:02] <Bodie> blargh

[13:04] <Bodie> i like it

[15:10] <Speljohan__> i do
[15:10] <Parthon> you only have a 35gb hard drive?
[15:10] <Marach-16> Speljohan__: grooveshark

[15:10] <Speljohan__> no dependency on interwebs
[15:10] <Speljohan__> etc

[15:10] <Marach-16> Speljohan__: i back it up on ipod touch

[15:11] <Speljohan__> ps i'd need a whole bunch of ipods
[15:11] <Speljohan__> cus 296gb music
[15:11] <EmpiresBane> i want my fucking phone to arrive already
[15:11] <Marach-16> do you even know all the tracks

[15:12] <Speljohan__> hmm
[15:12] <EmpiresBane> i have 2 bands

[15:14] <Speljohan__> why wouldn't i?
[15:14] <EmpiresBane> you reaaly like anal, don't you?
[15:14] <Speljohan__> it's all great bands
[15:14] <Marach-16> because you need that much
[15:14] <Speljohan__> with the exception of the "anal" bands
[15:14] <Speljohan__> cus they are for shits and giggles
[15:14] <Speljohan__> Marach-16 i like a very diverse range of music
[15:14] <EmpiresBane> they're like a tenth of your selection!
[15:14] <Speljohan__> and if i like a genre i'm likely to enjoy every single band in it

[21:24] <Bodie> i spose
[21:24] <Bodie> i feel its just a part of the style
[21:24] <Azathoth> is the 5th book out yet?
[21:24] <Bodie> 5th book?
[21:24] <Bodie> i go by issues
[21:24] <Bodie> 71 came out last week
[21:24] * Cat is now known as Csharp
[21:25] <Azathoth> buying by the issue is expensive
[21:25] <Bodie> apparently they'll be up to 75 within a month and a bit
[21:25] * Csharp is now known as Cat
[21:25] * EmpiresBane (EmpiresBan@pool-71-111-54-232.ptldor.dsl-w.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: You guys bore me...)
[21:25] <Azathoth> unless you just pirate them i guess
[21:25] <Bodie> i spose... i couldnt bare to wait though
[21:25] * EmpiresBane (EmpiresBan@pool-71-111-54-232.ptldor.dsl-w.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[21:25] <Bodie> and i find it easier to spend 5 bucks every month
[21:25] <Mithril> So I heard gold = bad is that true?
[21:25] <Bodie> than 25 or so
[21:25] <Bodie> every 6
[21:25] <Azathoth> i just feel ripped off when i go and pay $3.50 and then get like 5 minutes out of it
[21:25] <Bodie> i spose
[21:25] <Bodie> i dunno, i dont mind
[21:25] <Azathoth> mithril, yes
[21:26] <EmpiresBane> well... not bad, just weel
[21:26] <Bodie> when you think about the effort thats gone into the comic
[21:26] <Mithril> So Its worse than iron in minecraft?
[21:26] <EmpiresBane> *week
[21:26] <EmpiresBane> yes
[21:26] <Azathoth> book 5 came out 2 days ago apparently
[21:26] <EmpiresBane> it's like wood
[21:26] <EmpiresBane> i believe
[21:26] <Azathoth> weak*
[21:26] <Bodie> ah
[21:26] <EmpiresBane> damnit. i failed even my correction
[21:26] <Bodie> arent the trades almost the same value as buying by the issue?
[21:26] <Bodie> 25 bucks for about 6 issues
[21:26] <Azathoth> i don't know
[21:26] <Bodie> saving the price of one issue
[21:26] <Bodie> although in australia everything is more expensive
[21:27] <Azathoth> the hardcover books are like $30
[21:27] <Azathoth> or is it 40?
[21:27] <Bodie> no point comparing prices, i'm guessing you're american?
[21:27] <Azathoth> hmm... they're only 11 or 12 issues? it seemed like more
[21:27] <Azathoth> yea
[21:27] <Mithril> <EmpiresBane> it's like wood - So now i got 51 gold bars for nothing
[21:28] <Bodie> mmh
[21:28] <Azathoth> mithril, use them for decoration
[21:28] <Bodie> i dont like hardcovers
[21:28] <Bodie> not with comics
[21:28] <Bodie> just not a nice feel
[21:28] <EmpiresBane> pretty much
[21:28] <Bodie> do you read invincible too azathoth?
[21:28] <Mithril> ok
[21:28] <Azathoth> no
[21:28] <Azathoth> i don't read a lot of comics
[21:28] <Azathoth> they're too expensive for me
[21:28] <Bodie> ah k
[21:28] <Bodie> yeah
[21:28] <Bodie> i've only recently started reading them
[21:29] <Azathoth> i had the walking dead books gifted to me
[21:29] <Azathoth> and i've only bought a few other miscellaneous issues of comics
[21:29] <Bodie> i pirated most of walking dead and invincible to catch up to the current issues
[21:29] <Bodie> ah k
[21:29] <Bodie> fairrrr enough
[21:29] <Azathoth> and then i recently picked up the omnibus things of the dark horse aliens and aliens vs predator comics
[21:29] <Azathoth> which are of varying quality, but in general are pretty interesting
[21:31] <Azathoth> doh. i was reading wikipedia and it said that the lead character was going to be played by abraham lincoln
[21:31] <Azathoth> i got all excited until i realized i misread that as andrew lincoln

[22:08] <vurtual> start a lawn mowing business, a small one.

[22:08] <vurtual> You cannot have shame, as nobody knows it's you.
[22:08] <vurtual> then when you're gaining money
[22:08] <vurtual> buy an upgraded costume
[22:08] <vurtual> Which has a cooling system, and a tiny computer

[22:35] <Kodaichi> Any job where you have to "pay to get started" is definitely a scam.
[22:35] <gdude2002> yeah

[22:38] <vurtual> So this technological twilight door of shieldingy is not dying
[22:38] <Kodaichi> huh?
[22:38] <vurtual> A ram didn't kill it, a cannon didn't kill it, a hovercar outfitted with dual super cannons(4 steampunk-looking cannons of power each) didn't kill it(or even harm it, or hit it very well)
[22:38] <vurtual> not even a weaponized gumball machine.
[22:38] <vurtual> So I've built a railgun.
[22:39] <Kodaichi> What you need is a Doom Laser
[22:39] <EmpiresBane> what are you playing?
[22:39] <vurtual> Size comparison: The tracks it uses make it roughly big enough to be a rollercoaster, and the round also has a jet turbine to propel it best.
[22:39] <vurtual> Garry's Mod. There is a door.
[22:39] <vurtual> Door must die.
[22:39] <EmpiresBane> i so want to play
[22:39] <Kodaichi> vurtual: what the hel;l is with those doors the combine can go through, but you can't?
[22:39] <Kodaichi> that's so bs eh?
[22:40] <Kodaichi> Was it ever explained?
[22:40] <vurtual> the shields?

[22:40] <Kodaichi> yes
[22:40] <vurtual> They're combine shields that repel not-combines
[22:40] <Kodaichi> but trains can go through them
[22:40] <vurtual> they're combine trains
[22:40] <vurtual> well it just blocks things like normal people who aren't authorized by a camera
[22:40] <Kodaichi> :/ that's weird though
[22:40] <vurtual> It actually intentionally blocks things
[22:41] <vurtual> If you were a humen and it was like "okay ur humen who should go through here, you can go through", then you can go through
[22:41] <Kodaichi> ah, smart doors. kinda makes sense
[22:41] <vurtual> otherwise it blocks you
[22:41] <EmpiresBane> makes sense, as long as you leave reality out of it
[22:41] <vurtual> EmpiresBane, we have technologyl ike that now, sorta.
[22:41] <vurtual> Energy shields that block spots infront of disallowed only? They already kinda work.
[22:42] <vurtual> Mappers have taken the combine shield thingy and applied it in creative ways
[22:42] <vurtual> like having it be reprogrammed to stop combine.
[22:42] <vurtual> You could even make a mod where it only blocks bullets from combine weapons.
[22:42] <vurtual> So they can't shoot through, but you can.
[22:42] <Kodaichi> It's kinda like how if you walk into a Cuban city and you're American, your wallet automatically gets stolen
[22:42] <vurtual> What if I don't have a wallet?
[22:43] <Kodaichi> lol something of value tyo replace

[22:44] <vurtual> or have me suffocate them by pinching their arm with my iron grip.

[22:45] <vurtual> mine
[22:45] <vurtual> Kodaichi, I'd run.
[22:45] <vurtual> I don't think they can parkour.
[22:45] <vurtual> onto busses
[22:45] <Kodaichi> they can climb coconut trees
[22:46] <EmpiresBane> does it happen to be open for others to join?
[22:46] <vurtual> If you got a password
[22:46] <EmpiresBane> could i, by chance, get a password?
[22:46] <EmpiresBane> i want to try that wall
[22:47] <vurtual> I'd ahve to verify you for addons

[22:48] <vurtual> yeah
[22:48] <vurtual> adds more stuff
[22:48] <EmpiresBane> i'll look into that and the cannon
[22:48] <vurtual> I hav the links right here

[22:54] <AzureAngelic> on 360
[22:54] <EmpiresBane> oh
[22:55] <vurtual> pc has soem annyonace
[22:55] <EmpiresBane> too bad you can't really mod on the 360 though
[22:55] <vurtual> but you learn it quickly
[22:55] <AzureAngelic> the only issue i have with the controls really is that its hard to grapple enemies
[22:55] <AzureAngelic> most of the time you just miss and pull yourself next to them

[23:05] <Dommys> Like they used to use in school/meetings for single sheet of cell paper

[23:06] <Dommys> More like, Backyard movie night
[23:06] <Kodaichi> cool
[23:07] <Dommys> Just gotta buy a cheap canvas sheet 15ft or so
[23:07] <Dommys> And a pipe, heavy cord, pulley :D
[23:08] <Azathoth> man, i need to get ahold on several massive LCD screens
[23:08] <Dommys> A couple Case fans from old PC cases
[23:08] <Azathoth> and then rip out a wall
[23:08] <Dommys> Massive?
[23:08] <Dommys> lol.
[23:08] <Azathoth> and put the screens in it
[23:08] <Azathoth> it would be pure epicness
[23:09] <Azathoth> i actually wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing LCD walls in the near future
[23:09] <Azathoth> (inb4 projectors, which i can't stand)
[23:10] * Varriount is now known as Vgor
[23:10] <Kodaichi> LCD Walls: They're probably being implemented in some Sony store as we speak
[23:10] <Azathoth> imagine how amazing that would be
[23:11] <Azathoth> they could have all kinds of cool apps
[23:11] <Azathoth> screensavers and the like
[23:11] <Kodaichi> I'd make my walls continuously scroll upwards so it looks like the room is descending
[23:11] <Azathoth> and clock widgets and stuff
[23:11] <Azathoth> it would be even cooler if they were multi-input touch screens
[23:11] <Kodaichi> The do drugs and trip
[23:12] <Kodaichi> :/
[23:12] <Azathoth> the technology already exists, but cost is the prohibiting factor
[23:12] <Kodaichi> Now, that's the aspect ratio of my wall...?
[23:12] <Azathoth> width/height
[23:12] <Kodaichi> probably like 137:103
[23:12] <Kodaichi> something awful
[23:13] <Azathoth> and you could have digital paintings and stuff
[23:13] <Azathoth> and oh god... porn on an entire wall
[23:14] <Azathoth> it could also serve as a light source too
[23:16] <Azathoth> ideally they would use OLEDs though
[23:17] <Azathoth> actually, you can already get tiled LCD walls from places

[23:21] <Scrippy> LCD or projector?
[23:21] <Azathoth> LCD
[23:21] <Azathoth> projectors are just lame
[23:21] <Scrippy> Agreed.

[23:24] <Scrippy> I could get behind that.
[23:24] <Azathoth> basically
[23:24] <Scrippy> We should pool our huge theoretical fortunes.
[23:24] <Azathoth> and fund the development of that thing iron man uses
[23:25] <Azathoth> it would pave the advancement for so many portable technologies
[23:25] <Scrippy> Yup.
[23:25] <Azathoth> pave the way*
[23:25] <Azathoth> for
[23:25] <Azathoth> shit
[23:25] <Scrippy> Portable is the way to go.
[23:25] <Azathoth> people of the future will be all "don't mind me. that's just my pocket particle accelerator!"

[23:27] <Azathoth> but such a power supply would have many military applications
[23:28] <Azathoth> like rail guns
[23:28] <Quatroking> stunguns
[23:28] <Azathoth> oh god
[23:28] <Azathoth> that might be a bit overkill
[23:28] <Quatroking> "woops, I still had it on the 15 megavolt setting."
[23:28] <Azathoth> haha
[23:29] <Azathoth> i can't wait for man-portable rail guns
[23:29] <Azathoth> that's going to completely change warfare
[23:29] <Azathoth> a single infantry man will be capable of sniping a tank

[23:30] <Quatroking> bzarp
[23:30] <Azathoth> not necessarily great
[23:30] <Quatroking> there go the pooters

[23:31] <Scrippy> Shit will be so nifty.
[23:31] <Kodaichi> I just had a good time
[23:31] <Kodaichi> My mom was trying to help my sister with her homework

[23:31] <Kodaichi> My mom actually though a triangular prism was a square-based pyramid
[23:32] <kwerty> Kodaichi: Lol!
[23:32] <Azathoth> it would discourage the use of large armies and armored vehicles
[23:32] <kwerty> Just invent something that gets rid of weapons for good
[23:32] <Kodaichi> My momeventually understood the question but my sister DOES NOT get it.
[23:32] <Azathoth> and wars would become more of a sniper war, resulting in less collateral damage

[23:43] <TkTech> lol, ironically, switching "minds" was one of the most realistic things in Avatar
[23:43] <Kodaichi> What kind of crack have you guys been smoking? It's a flippin' tree! XD
[23:43] <PuyoDead> Looks like a followup was made. http://i.imgur.com/xJU7Q.jpg
[23:44] <Kodaichi> But the tree hears all. It makes souls switch bodies and doesnt afraid of anything
[23:44] <Azathoth> i think the throwing of wooden spears through several inch thick glass cockpits was the most realistic thing in avatar
[23:44] <TkTech> lol.
[23:44] <Scrippy> Kwerty
[23:44] <Azathoth> oh shit! asheron's call is on that pic
[23:44] <TkTech> Know something fun to do?
[23:44] * f0urtyfive (45@69.10.36.10) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[23:44] <Scrippy> Make a farm room, seal it off by two floodgates
[23:45] <Scrippy> One on your fort side and one on the river side
[23:45] <TkTech> use a knife to cut a rented DVD into slices, not fully cut but almost
[23:45] <TkTech> The disk will still work, and eventually explode in someones DVD drive
[23:45] <Kodaichi> Lol brute force was something I decided not to question. Those guys are huge and maybe their wood is stronger and harder than ours.
[23:45] <Scrippy> When you flood it make sure you close the gate that leads to your fort first
[23:45] <TkTech> Azathoth: All organism on Pandora are carbon-reinforced
[23:45] <Scrippy> Make sure you don't let the river flood your fort
[23:45] <Azathoth> i thought you said orgasms for a second
[23:45] <Scrippy> And water pressure will cause the water level to rise
[23:46] <kwerty> It's a movie, does it really matter if the wooden spears go through glass cockpits?
[23:46] <TkTech> Plus, look at the force difference from a native throwing that spear vs a human
[23:46] <TkTech> Not even on the same scale
[23:46] <Kodaichi> I liked how the one guy was able to ride that better bird
[23:46] <Scrippy> Carbon-nanotube reinforced.
[23:46] <bildramer> lol PuyoDead
[23:46] <bildramer> was this on Reddit too?
[23:46] <Kodaichi> "Hey guiz check out mai epic mount :D"
[23:46] <PuyoDead> Yup.
[23:46] <bildramer> hm
[23:46] <bildramer> wtf epic world
[23:46] <kwerty> Scrippy: Ah, of course. Thanks
[23:46] <Scrippy> Why do my DF traps always catch gross things?
[23:46] <Scrippy> So far I have
[23:46] <Scrippy> A lizard
[23:47] <Scrippy> A cardinal
[23:47] <bildramer> that's vermin
[23:47] <Azathoth> how come there aren't any games with nearly infinite procedurally generated worlds yet?
[23:47] <Scrippy> and a large roach.
[23:47] <AndrewPH> http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=681732
[23:47] <Azathoth> oh wait. there are >_>
[23:47] <Scrippy> Can I make them not catch vermin?
[23:47] <AzureAngelic> scrippy
[23:47] <bildramer> it's the first thing the traps find
[23:47] <bildramer> lol
[23:47] <AzureAngelic> are you building animal traps lol
[23:47] <Scrippy> Yes.
[23:47] <bildramer> get cats to catch vermin
[23:47] <AzureAngelic> if you want to catch actual animals build a cage trap
[23:47] <TkTech> Azathoth: Uh...Minecraft infdev?
[23:47] <Scrippy> I want to tame mountain goats!
[23:47] <TkTech> Azathoth: xD
[23:47] <bildramer> lol
[23:47] <Kodaichi> Dont worry Scrippy. YOu'll eventually catch the Epic silver Dragon's Hemlet
[23:47] <Scrippy> How do I do dis
[23:47] <Azathoth> i'm guessing those comparisons only count hand-crafted worlds or something?
[23:47] <AzureAngelic> b > T > cage trap
[23:47] <bildramer> Scrippy, DF 2010?
[23:47] <Azathoth> because minecraft should be like RAAAAARGH
[23:47] <AzureAngelic> takes one mechanism, one cage, and someone with mechanics
[23:47] <Azathoth> compared to those
[23:48] <bildramer> if yes
[23:48] <bildramer> dig downwards
[23:48] <bildramer> if no
[23:48] <bildramer> dig downwards
[23:48] <Scrippy> So I just thought of a great DF challenge.
[23:48] <AzureAngelic> doesnt always go off but catches pretty much everything
[23:48] <AzureAngelic> goblins included
[23:48] <AzureAngelic> and then you can do whatever you want with them
[23:48] <bildramer> and what's it?
[23:48] <Azathoth> guys i have a bit of a silly question
[23:48] <Scrippy> Druid mode:
[23:48] <bildramer> lol
[23:48] <Azathoth> are the dwarfs in DF supposed to run around so fast that you can barely even tell what they're doing?

[23:49] <TrueWolves> Azathoth, if your computer is very very good, yes
[23:49] <bildramer> sometimes
[23:49] <Scrippy> No military
[23:49] <bildramer> try SPEED:0 then be like "whoa"
[23:49] <Azathoth> because it feels like i'm playing an older game that doesn't have limited speed or something
[23:49] <Scrippy> Actually, scratch that.
[23:49] <Keiya> Woah, what the hell happened to the stock market yesterday?
[23:49] <bildramer> haha
[23:49] <bildramer> how good is your PC
[23:49] * Konogan|Sleep is now known as Konogan
[23:49] <Scrippy> All military personnel must also double as animal trainers.
[23:49] <Azathoth> idk. decent?
[23:49] <bildramer> lol
[23:49] <Konogan> Optimization <3
[23:49] <Scrippy> Each must be assigned a pet to fight with.
[23:49] <Azathoth> but those dwarfs are on crack. i can't follow them D:
[23:49] <bildramer> of best dwarvsmanship
[23:50] <Scrippy> I will totally make this DF challenge.
[23:50] * Bluedragoon (yami969@142.177.231.116) has joined #minecraft
[23:50] <Konogan> JC2 running at 30 FPS average at max settings :D
[23:50] <bildramer> wait what
[23:50] <Scrippy> Also, is there any trick to catching actual animals in cages?
[23:50] <Speljohan__> lol Kodaichi
[23:50] <bildramer> so, hm
[23:50] <Azathoth> what does SPEED:0 do?
[23:50] <Speljohan__> i'd probably max it at 60-70 fps
[23:50] <bildramer> make a trade depot flooding system
[23:50] <Scrippy> Or do I jsut set one and hope?
[23:50] <Speljohan__> haven't tried it yet tho
[23:50] <bildramer> if the elves get pissed
[23:50] <Speljohan__> err Konogan*
[23:50] <Kodaichi> lol I was wondering for a sec
[23:51] <Scrippy> Bonus points: Trade depot lava flooding system
[23:51] <Azathoth> also 30 FPS is pretty low :P
[23:51] <Konogan> 30 FPS is alright.
[23:51] <Speljohan__> 30 fps is bare minimum for any game tbh
[23:51] <bildramer> also, we really need a better anti-siege strategy
[23:51] <bildramer> and mines
[23:51] <Speljohan__> it's very much playable
[23:51] <bildramer> gunpowder :>
[23:51] <Konogan> it's pretty fluid at 30 FPS :P
[23:51] <Speljohan__> however, most games tend to run at 100-200 fps on this box
[23:51] <Speljohan__> lol
[23:51] <bildramer> I'll try to mod tomorrow
[23:51] <Speljohan__> except crysis of course
[23:51] <Kodaichi> http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/blaster395/986419 <- this game is always epic
[23:51] <Speljohan__> around 40 fps maxed out crysis on this box
[23:51] <Speljohan__> lol
[23:52] <Azathoth> kodaichi lol yes
[23:52] <Konogan> Spel, my box only costed 500 bucks though :P
