[3:42] <Visiiri> they slow you down.
[3:42] <Dys|afk> I like charging people through the loft windows :D
[3:43] <Dys|afk> Also survival is so much harder T.t

[6:16] <MarkofBear> thats the.... haxx map

[6:24] <Commandhat> One thing that I find it easier to do in minecraft is to jump before you get hit.
[6:25] <ClassiestMedic> But once I've placed it
[6:25] <Commandhat> It catapults you at least 3 times as far.

[7:23] <Mos> yes
[7:23] <vurtual> A witch, tank, witch, then an end area full of zombies and SI for no reason, it's madness.

[7:24] <Siiseli> still drunk
[7:24] <vurtual> Technically by that point, if you got around weaknesses in minecraft, you'd have no hard limit whatsoever.
[7:24] <Visiiri> It should simply crash on more than 32.
[7:24] <LuciferZ> Lol. Awesome.
[7:24] <vurtual> Drunk Siiseli? That's... that's unsafe sounding.
[7:24] * vurtual goes back to his game and hopes it doesn't see him

[7:31] <Mos> i dunno about you guys but l4d got boring for me
[7:31] <Visiiri> You are a joke.
[7:31] <Mos> l4d2 made the game fresh again
[7:31] <Visiiri> Hey vurtual
[7:31] <Malikfkfk> L4D2 added new weapons that don't change anything
[7:31] <Visiiri> your linear story line
[7:31] <Malikfkfk> changed the way weapons work
[7:31] <Visiiri> ends with bill dead.
[7:32] <Mos> bill nooo
[7:32] <Malikfkfk> and added monsters that, in campaign, are just annoying
[7:32] <Visiiri> And francis will die soon after
[7:32] <Mos> wha
[7:32] <Malikfkfk> and in multiplayer are sort of interesting
[7:32] <Mos> the new zombies are great
[7:32] <vurtual> It was made from counter-strike bot killing, it's about a nam vet who's too old for this, an ascended fanboy teenage girl who's way too into zombie movies, a sarcastic biker guy who hates everything, and a happy-go-lucky IT guy.
[7:32] <vurtual> And unlike l4d2, it's honestly creepy.

[7:33] <Mos> hard rain is pretty creepy
[7:33] <coladash> and bill is dead
[7:33] <Visiiri> Yeah, L4D2 lacks developed characters.
[7:33] <Visiiri> Loius will not last long, he's permanently incapacitated.
[7:33] <vurtual> he just needs a helpings-up
[7:33] <vurtual> and bill a defib
[7:33] <Malikfkfk> i thought l4d2 was retardedly harder

[8:45] <vede> Visiiri, it's theoretically possible to construct an endless, random plot generator.
[8:46] <Yourself> well, technically it'd be periodic at some point
[8:46] <Yourself> unless you used a natural process to seed an RNG
[8:46] <Visiiri> vede: there's no way.
[8:47] <vede> Visiiri, sure there is.
[8:47] <Visiiri> I mean, an actual open ended game.
[8:47] <Yourself> but you can get ridiculously huge periods
[8:47] <vede> Yeah, that's what I mean, Visiiri.
[8:47] <Visiiri> Imagine morrowind, except without any limits to plotline.
[8:47] <vurtual> Hey guys, what if we colonized the asteroid belt?
[8:47] <Visiiri> Go wherever, do whatever, yeah.
[8:47] <vede> That's basically what I'm talking about, Visiiri.
[8:47] <Visiiri> Well.
[8:47] <vurtual> Like, built a massive ring-planet encircling inside it, using the belt for on-the-spot resources.
[8:47] <Visiiri> I suppose it is possible
[8:48] <Visiiri> but it would have constraints on elements
[8:48] <Visiiri> and dynamic abilities

[9:01] <Visiiri> I am a logical thinker and I like to bitch about things that are made in impossible ways.

[9:03] <Solece> Yeah not that long

[9:03] * setveen (setveen@d24-57-103-82.home.cgocable.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[9:03] <Visiiri> You also have to account for cellular oxidation.
[9:03] <Visiiri> But that wouldn't limit it much at all.
[9:03] <vurtual> low gravity can also kill you after a long time
[9:03] <vurtual> Also, go really fast.
[9:03] <vurtual> you'll live many thousands of years longer
[9:04] <Solece> Well, you cant think of age as in if your old or not
[9:04] <Visiiri> Of course not.
[9:04] <vurtual> Also being healthy and healy enough might make you immortal
[9:04] <vurtual> Well, from age
[9:05] <Visiiri> Ageing.
[9:05] <Visiiri> But there is a genetic factor in life expectancy aswell.
[9:05] <Solece> you stop growing at around 20-30 years, from then on you simply take damage
[9:05] <vurtual> aging
[9:05] <Visiiri> And there's oxidation.
[9:05] <Visiiri> Solece: That's because of chromosin, too.
[9:05] <vurtual> When you're like, 40, you'll probably be stronger than when you're 30.
[9:05] <McC1oud> Minecraft: When you coolect bits of the trees when you destroy them, what is the use of these? replanting maybe?
[9:05] <vurtual> Infact my dad has just been stronger and healthier with age

[9:06] <Solece> I fucking hate the first night in infdev
[9:06] <Visiiri> As your cells require Chromosin to undergo meitosis, (sp?) more chromosin would allow them to duplicate more than ~48 times.

[9:08] <Visiiri> If there was a way to control chromosine, perhaps you would become immortal.
[9:08] <EmpiresBane> nanobots are the cure for cancer

[9:09] <EmpiresBane> yeah

[9:09] <EmpiresBane> your muscles become weak with the lack of strain

[9:10] <Visiiri> Of course, massive adaptations would be required, but some of them are growth characteristics.
[9:11] <Solece> In theory you should be able to live considerably longer on the moon than on earth
[9:11] <Solece> but
[9:11] <vurtual> you have to mash x all the time while playing, if you stop for more than a few moments you die.

[9:11] <EmpiresBane> imagine how easy it would be to get fat in space
[9:12] <Visiiri> No, but it is a very supported theory.
[9:12] <Solece> Well its pretty self explainitory, seeing as how everything your body does would be easier in lower gravity
[9:12] <Yourself> if there's no evidence, what's it supported by?
[9:12] <EmpiresBane> except for swallowing
[9:12] <Visiiri> What solece just said.
[9:12] <Yourself> that doesn't mean you'll live longer
[9:12] <EmpiresBane> that would be a little harder

[9:18] <The_Lurker> whoah
[9:19] <Solece> Who else here hates the first night on infdev
[9:19] <Visiiri> Yourself: I'm from Australia, I went to a lab where they were testing it on fetus pigs. It was 'Chromosine' there.
[9:19] <Navaros4> lol infdev
[9:19] <McC1oud> there are half stair blocks, though you cant build the blocks step by thep
[9:19] <EmpiresBane> everybody needs to shut up about #mcchatter.
[9:19] <Visiiri> And you didn't even know what it was until a moment ago.
[9:19] <EmpiresBane> it's a failure
[9:19] <McC1oud> every second step yuo need to build a full block
[9:19] <The_Lurker> you're a failure!
[9:19] <Yourself> until i used the spelling i just used and found some references to it
[9:19] <Subhazard> Every second step I make a furnace, I must be doing it wrong.
[9:19] <EmpiresBane> your mom's a failure!
[9:20] <Solece> McC1oud: i meant a ladder block
[9:20] <McC1oud> o right
[9:20] <Subhazard> A ladder block might be cool
[9:20] <Subhazard> Incredibly exploitable :P
[9:20] <Visiiri> Well, the idea behind Chromosin is that it can be used to permanently allow mitosis, and the results of this are unknown.
[9:20] <EmpiresBane> 'cept notch said no
[9:20] <Yourself> are there any more published results with this?
[9:20] <EmpiresBane> and i kinda agree
[9:20] <Yourself> because i can only find one
[9:20] <Navaros4> has anyone heard of anything Notch is doing lately?
[9:20] <Solece> If he made minecarts i wouldnt care
[9:20] <The_Lurker> every second step i make two stair blocks, i must be doing it wrong
[9:20] <Visiiri> Australia first launched a test on pigs in 1991, so no, there wouldn't be published results.
[9:20] <ElectricFuzzball> mitosis is allowed
[9:20] <Subhazard> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=12215&p=182329#p182329 Custom block idea. Very simple
[9:21] <The_Lurker> bad idea
[9:21] <Yourself> so why are you so sure of its effects?
[9:21] <Subhazard> Why is it a bad idea.
[9:21] <EmpiresBane> yeah. won't work
[9:21] <The_Lurker> signs own you
[9:21] <Visiiri> Yourself: It is twenty years old, and expiriments have been done.
[9:21] <Subhazard> Notch could make a shitload of money if he did 'account upgrades' where people could buy custom block slots.
[9:21] <Yourself> but not published
[9:21] <EmpiresBane> let me go post why it fails
[9:21] <The_Lurker> no sub
[9:21] <McC1oud> We need bigger booms
[9:21] <Visiiri> I am not sure of it's results, by any means.
[9:21] <EmpiresBane> wait, can everyone see the block?
[9:21] <The_Lurker> you have no idea how the game works
[9:21] * Roadcrosser is now known as aFkeSky
[9:22] <Subhazard> Yeah, just like a player skin.
[9:22] <EmpiresBane> that won't work
[9:22] <The_Lurker> facedesk
[9:22] <Subhazard> Why.
[9:22] <Solece> Subhazard: but then there would be the rich douche he bought like 20 slots
[9:22] <Subhazard> So?
[9:22] <Subhazard> That's his money.
[9:22] <Visiiri> Other than tests in the last twenty years, there is little known about this.
[9:22] <EmpiresBane> because....
[9:22] <Solece> So the server would have to send all those skins
[9:22] <Solece> to the clients
[9:22] <Subhazard> Solece
[9:22] <McC1oud> create a pattern with 5 tnts in a + for a much bigger boom
[9:22] <Subhazard> It already does that with player skins
[9:22] <Subhazard> Are you guys serious?
[9:22] <EmpiresBane> it would require a billion block types
[9:22] <Solece> 1 skin
[9:23] <The_Lurker> I have enough trouble with player skins, tyvm
[9:23] <EmpiresBane> 1 block per skin
[9:23] <Subhazard> Right. So one block skin and one player skin. So far it's been seamless.
[9:23] <Subhazard> No one has trouble with player skins, you're full of shit.
[9:23] <The_Lurker> :/
[9:23] <EmpiresBane> no!
[9:23] <The_Lurker> troll
[9:23] <Visiiri> Subhazard: The server doesn't touch player skins.
[9:23] <EmpiresBane> 1 block per skin!
[9:23] <Visiiri> The client retrieves them from the .jsp at minecraft.net
[9:23] <EmpiresBane> think of how many blocks that would be!
[9:23] <Subhazard> Right!
[9:23] <Subhazard> Same concept.
[9:23] <Solece> Oh right
[9:23] <Solece> Hm
[9:23] <Subhazard> So the account gets one player skin, and one block skin
[9:23] <Subhazard> Easy.
[9:23] <Visiiri> I suppose it would work, but not with the current engine.
[9:24] <McC1oud> Demobox = 5x tnt
[9:24] <Subhazard> It would be EASIER to make a block skin, than a player skin
[9:24] <Visiiri> The server has to support the blocks still.
[9:24] <Subhazard> As you could only skin ONE face of the box.
[9:24] <McC1oud> nuke = 9x tnt
[9:24] <EmpiresBane> no! are you guys retarded?
[9:24] <The_Lurker> there is a reason most servers have a max number of players
[9:24] <McC1oud> 9 x demobox*
[9:24] <Subhazard> Shut up McC1oud
[9:24] <Subhazard> That's a terrible idea.
[9:24] <Visiiri> It's simple why the blocks wouldn't work the whole way.
[9:24] <Subhazard> Fuck you and your nukes, that shit ruined Garrysmod addon developement.
[9:24] <Subhazard> Fucking nukes.
[9:24] <EmpiresBane> you would have to have a new block type for each skin
[9:24] <Visiiri> The server sends the blocks in packets
[9:24] <McC1oud> Hands raised who wouldnt wanna see bigger bombs =D
[9:24] <The_Lurker> garrysmod ruined itself :/
[9:25] <Subhazard> Okay, someone explain to me why a player skin works, and why a block skin wouldn't.
[9:25] <Visiiri> 0 is air, 1 is flat stone, 4 is cobble, 43 is doublestep, 44 is halfstep, 49 is obsidian.
[9:25] <EmpiresBane> i have been!
[9:25] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:25] <EmpiresBane> EmpiresBane> you would have to have a new block type for each skin
[9:25] <The_Lurker> 9999 is custom block 3000...
[9:25] <Visiiri> So, a block change sends the block id and the location to every closet.
[9:25] <Visiiri> *client, not closet
[9:25] <Subhazard> You make a new block type, that has a texture that's linked to the player custom block file.
[9:25] <Codlike> minecraft.net hosts all the player skins, and every client downloads the skins from minecraft.net each time they join a server
[9:25] * Navaros4 (Mibbit@c-76-106-240-143.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[9:25] <Subhazard> There aren't new entities for EVERY PLAYER
[9:25] <Subhazard> It's one entity, with different skin
[9:25] <EmpiresBane> but!
[9:25] <The_Lurker> then everyone would see only their own skin O_o
[9:26] <EmpiresBane> blocks aren't entities
[9:26] <Subhazard> But nothing, you just want to be contrary. You know it's awesome.
[9:26] <EmpiresBane> you are a fucktard....
[9:26] <Subhazard> How, explain.
[9:26] <Visiiri> Subhazard: It wouldn't work because different people would join, and there's not a block ID for everyone.
[9:26] <McC1oud> need more bombs
[9:26] <Subhazard> So why couldn't notch make one?
[9:26] <EmpiresBane> what?
[9:26] <Visiiri> Because it's not in the engine, and it would take a hell of alot of optimization.
[9:26] <Subhazard> What?
[9:26] <Subhazard> One block type?
[9:26] <Subhazard> Really?
[9:26] <Visiiri> No, the thousands of block types from everyone.
[9:27] <Subhazard> Do you really think Notch has to overhall the entire engine to make one new block type.
[9:27] <EmpiresBane> it's not one fucking block type
[9:27] <Visiiri> It's NOT one new block type
[9:27] <The_Lurker> but IT WOULD BE 1000000s of block types
[9:27] <Visiiri> It would be block types for everyone.
[9:27] * Fenix393 (Gregorydta@c-68-35-21-164.hsd1.nm.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:27] <Yourself> and currently it only supports 256 different block types
[9:27] <Subhazard> You could make it one block type, it's just the skin that changes. All you'd have to do is make the block grab the texture from a url.
[9:27] <Visiiri> The client would have to fetch them from minecraft.net
[9:27] <Cial> we have gained some bright ones
[9:27] <Subhazard> JUST
[9:27] <Subhazard> LIKE
[9:27] <Subhazard> A PLAYER
[9:27] <Subhazard> SKIN
[9:27] <The_Lurker> subhazard, are you a troll, or just retarded?
[9:27] <EmpiresBane> how is that one block going to keep track of which skin to display?
[9:27] <Visiiri> And it would have to know when to fetch them from www.minecraft.net
[9:27] <Visiiri> Through block changes
[9:27] <Yourself> SubBoy, that's still a monumental waste of energy
[9:27] <Solece> Also Subhazard, you have to remember that minecraft.net is not a truck that you just dump stuff on
[9:27] <Yourself> Subhazard
[9:27] <Yourself> fuck you guys and your similar names
[9:27] <Codlike> I dont see any player models changing anytime soon
[9:28] <Visiiri> and the server can't support sending packets that don't exist.
[9:28] <Yourself> Solece: it's a series of tubes
[9:28] <Solece> Exactly
[9:28] <The_Lurker> everyone would only see their own skin for that block if you did that subhazard
[9:28] <vurtual> So, remembering back when Notch said he'd opensource minecraft eveeeentually
[9:28] <Subhazard> So, is Notch so inept that he couldn't do this?
[9:28] <vurtual> Think someone's gonna try to port it to C or C++?
[9:28] <Subhazard> I mean, he can do it for player skins.
[9:28] <EmpiresBane> no.
[9:28] * Cial sighs
[9:28] <Subhazard> What is the main difference here.
[9:28] <Yourself> players aren't blocks
[9:28] <Subhazard> No shit?
[9:29] <EmpiresBane> Subhazard, they are two fucking DIFFERENT things
[9:29] <Visiiri> Subhazard: The server determines blocks, the client determines players.
[9:29] <The_Lurker> subhazard, you try it, then say if it's easy
[9:29] <Subhazard> Think of sprays in Counterstrike.
[9:29] <Yourself> there are rarely more than a few players on a server
[9:29] <EmpiresBane> oh my god....
[9:29] <Yourself> there are over 4 million blocks on a standard sized map
[9:29] <EmpiresBane> do you know how minecraft stores block data?
[9:29] <Tommerry11> infdev http://www.livestream.com/tommerry11sminecraft
[9:29] <EmpiresBane> no Tommerry11
[9:29] <Yourself> each block would have to make room for some kind of data structure referencing its texture
[9:29] <Tommerry11> what?
[9:30] <The_Lurker> tommery, you're an idiot
[9:30] <Subhazard> What about little big planet.

[9:30] <Yourself> what about it?
[9:30] <Subhazard> People upload their own data all the time
[9:30] <Subhazard> Into their creations, it becomes server side.
[9:30] <The_Lurker> *facedesk*
[9:30] <Yourself> ffs
[9:30] <Visiiri> *facekatana*
[9:31] <Yourself> block data is stored in an array
[9:31] <EmpiresBane> <EmpiresBane> do you know how minecraft stores block data
[9:31] <Yourself> currently, in creative, each block is exactly one byte

[9:31] <The_Lurker> THOSE GAMES ARE MADE BY MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS WITH TERRABYTES OF SERVER SPACE! MINECRAFT IS MADE BY ONE PERSON! subhazard, you are a troll
[9:31] <EmpiresBane> <EmpiresBane> how is that one block going to keep track of which skin to display?
[9:31] <Superwafflez> so... texture and position data is in one byte?
[9:31] <Yourself> no
[9:31] <Subhazard> Enough with the troll shit. Not everyone is a troll. This isn't 4chan.
[9:32] <Yourself> block type is in one type
[9:32] <The_Lurker> you are though
[9:32] <Yourself> position corresponds to position in the array
[9:32] <Yourself> texture is just looked up in a table mapping block types to various data about that block
[9:32] <Superwafflez> oh ok
[9:32] <Subhazard> That makes sense.
[9:32] <Subhazard> Yeah, servers generally deal simply with numbers, right?
[9:32] <Visiiri> Yes.
[9:32] <EmpiresBane> no answer this...
[9:32] <EmpiresBane> <EmpiresBane> how is that one block going to keep track of which skin to display?
[9:32] <Subhazard> Positions, movement.

[9:33] <Annihilator> magic
[9:33] <Visiiri> Actually, it could be done, I suppose.
[9:33] <Annihilator> everything is magic
[9:33] <Subhazard> So I'm curious now, how do valve games do the whole spray thing?
[9:33] <Yourself> the problem is, if you want to have two blocks of the same type have different textures, you need to add some extra data field to blocks to be able to distinguish them from one another
[9:33] <Visiiri> Subhazard: Client to client
[9:33] <The_Lurker> terrabytes of server space subhazard
[9:33] <Yourself> the source engine is also capable of creating overlays
[9:33] <Subhazard> Lurker
[9:33] <Subhazard> No
[9:33] <Yourself> bullet holes are actually done the same way as sprays
[9:33] <Subhazard> Valve does not contain all the sprays.
[9:33] <vurtual> bulletholes are decals
[9:34] <vurtual> And ejected shells are particles.
[9:34] <Yourself> each spray or bullet hole or marking or whatever has some kind of reference to the texture it's using
[9:34] * bjzaba (brendanzab@CPE-121-223-76-102.lnse2.woo.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[9:34] <Visiiri> bullet holes are totally client side, and have nothing to do with servers.
[9:34] <Yourself> among other things
[9:34] <Subhazard> I'm aware that sprays are a decal
[9:34] <Subhazard> I make maps
[9:34] <vurtual> So is dynamic water parts of the engine.
[9:34] <Subhazard> But
[9:34] <vurtual> (Something valve, shockingly, did not use)
[9:34] <Subhazard> I'm wondering how the data is sent.
[9:34] <Yourself> <Visiiri> bullet holes are totally client side, and have nothing to do with servers.
[9:34] <Superwafflez> dynamic water is just too processor intensive.
[9:34] <Yourself> never said they weren't
[9:34] <vurtual> Not really, Superwafflez.
[9:34] <Subhazard> Because that model could be used for minecraft.
[9:34] <Yourself> i said they were decals
[9:34] <vurtual> People do it in source all the time.
[9:34] <Visiiri> Yourself: I think he's asking about how they do it server side, as that's what we're talking about.
[9:34] <vurtual> It can, technically, do things like make some kinds of water flood and fill a room.
[9:34] <Yourself> is it?
[9:35] <Superwafflez> People pass particle effects off as dynamic water.
[9:35] <Yourself> i don't know wtf he's asking
[9:35] <vurtual> It's good enough, you can make it control water levels.
[9:35] <Visiiri> He's not asking it correctly, that's why.
[9:35] <vurtual> You know the EP2 part with the water's spraying down?
[9:35] <Subhazard> That's particle effects.
[9:35] <Visiiri> I mean, the sprays aren't placed by the server that is hosting the game.
[9:35] <Subhazard> Not physical objects.
[9:35] <vurtual> You could have that flood the room if you wanted to.
[9:35] <Visiiri> The sprays are sent out by the client to the other clients
[9:35] <vurtual> with some modding
[9:35] <Subhazard> Ew ick, particle physics
[9:35] <Visiiri> who retrieve the spray from valve
[9:35] <Visiiri> ...I think.
[9:35] <The_Lurker> they are set client>server>clients
[9:35] <Subhazard> No
[9:35] <Visiiri> That's how minecraft works, at least. :)
[9:35] <Superwafflez> Yeah, a brush would raise from the floor as the particle effect plays.
[9:35] <vurtual> sprays are sent to the server and then back
[9:35] <The_Lurker> sent*
[9:36] <Subhazard> I've used sprays in lan.
[9:36] <Subhazard> Sprays are not sent to valve.
[9:36] <Visiiri> no?
[9:36] <The_Lurker> WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT VALVE?
[9:36] <Visiiri> Then it's completely client, except maybe something like "I'm spraying"
[9:36] <Subhazard> That's one way to do that Superwafflez
[9:36] <The_Lurker> THE SERVER IS NOT VALVE
[9:36] <vurtual> You could directly link the water-raising to the particles landing in the pool
[9:36] <Subhazard> Visiiri did.
[9:36] <Visiiri> The_Lurker; if you're going to talk, read the damn conversation.
[9:36] <vurtual> Fill a bucket and then pour it in
[9:36] <Subhazard> Why don't you pay attention Lurker.
[9:36] <vurtual> anyways I need to play some more l4d before I go crazy
[9:36] <Subhazard> You should lurk more.
[9:36] <McC1oud> So whats the issue with infdev water not flowing, is it becuacse if the water was displaced it would have to calulate against ever water block on the map?
[9:36] <Visiiri> <Subhazard> So I'm curious now, how do valve games do the whole spray thing?
[9:36] <SubBoy> Hey, how to make it work: Have a single block that is "skinned" then, have a linked list that trees by the 16^3 area for easy retrieval, which ahs the texture.
[9:37] <The_Lurker> *facedesk*

[9:47] <The_Lurker> can i make a suggestion? bans for chatter outside of #mcchatter
[9:47] <Subhazard> It wouldn't work in the source engine.
[9:47] <vurtual> Some basic physics from quake, new networking, support for things like textures on blocks MAYBE, and then extra support to load maps from quake engine games, and mounting content.

[9:48] <vurtual> Quake engine+minecraft, using minecraft-style worlds
[9:48] <Visiiri> Read what I said
[9:48] <Marach> vurtual: i could remake the maps
[9:48] <vurtual> Or, minecrafting inside a BSP world, either.
[9:48] <Marach> i have some experience at it
[9:48] <Subhazard> The_Lurker: There isn't enough about minecraft to talk about to not have chatter in this channel. Stop bitching, no one's getting 'hurt' by talking about something else. I'm sick of people looking for things to enforce. If the rule wasn't there, you wouldn't care.
[9:48] <Visiiri> The_Lurker: Try reading the rules.
[9:48] <Visiiri> There is nothing against general chatter in minecraft, as long as minecraft > general chatter.
[9:49] <Visiiri> If general chatter disrupts a minecraft talk, it becomes a problem.
[9:49] * Mosslander (Mosslander@c-71-231-163-229.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:49] <The_Lurker> and there is no minecraft talk here, therefore chatter has overtaken minecraft
[9:49] <SubBoy> Hrm... The only thing I see with those engines is how it views maps, that's the big leap. (Making it changeable in game)
[9:50] <vurtual> Trial and errorly smoosh a C port of minecraft and a quake together until it works enough
[9:50] <Subhazard> Responded, Visiiri.
[9:50] <vurtual> Trying various different crazy insane methods
[9:50] <Subhazard> Right, coding can be described as 'smooshing'
[9:50] <Subhazard> It's a bit more involved than that Vurtual.
[9:51] <SubBoy> Ehhh.... Unless quake is open source, there is one isn't there?
[9:51] <Subhazard> I think so.
[9:51] <Subhazard> It's old enough.
[9:51] <vurtual> all the quakes that I know of
[9:51] <Subhazard> I'm really sad Deus Ex 2 isn't moddable, oh the possibilities.
[9:51] <vurtual> 1, 2, and 3 all have their engine GPLs
[9:51] <SubBoy> That's right, there's an available sdk, but.. I think the engine itself would need to be open source for that kind of "smooshing"
[9:52] <vurtual> Infact it'd probably not be too impossible to rip them to shreds and try to implement minecraft in flatgrass maps.
[9:52] <SubBoy> Oh, well there you go
[9:52] <Subhazard> The_Lurker, I think I'd like to see you banned.
[9:52] <Subhazard> Meet me in my Insult Thread.
[9:52] <Subhazard> You belong there.
[9:52] <vurtual> Subhazard, didn't yo momma teach you manners?
[9:52] <vurtual> That's like staring someone down in the face and going "I want to see you die."
[9:52] <Subhazard> No, but your momma did.
[9:52] <Subhazard> :P
[9:52] <Subhazard> That's not all she taught me ;)
[9:53] <vurtual> She's like, in her 60s
[9:53] <Subhazard> Can someone find out how big one block skin is?
[9:53] <Subhazard> Like, how big the texture file is
[9:53] <Yourself> i think it's 16x16
[9:54] <Subhazard> No
[9:54] <Subhazard> As in
[9:54] <Subhazard> Uh
[9:54] <Subhazard> File size
[9:54] <vurtual> it's a bunch of 32x32 squares in a map
[9:54] <vurtual> the file is
[9:54] <Subhazard> It's just not clicking in your head.
[9:54] * vurtual searches
[9:54] <Yourself> it'd be negligible in that respect
[9:54] <SubBoy> Well, that's the thing, they're all on a single texture map (though yeah, jsut counted, 16x16)
[9:54] <Annihilator> are we still talking about how bytes work
[9:54] <vurtual> 28.3 kb on my end
[9:55] <Subhazard> Okay

[9:57] <Subhazard> Okay
[9:57] <Subhazard> So
[9:57] <Visiiri> You know what, Subhazard's general idea could possibly work.
[9:57] <Subhazard> If you took 28.3 kb's
[9:58] <Subhazard> And multiplied it by
[9:58] <Subhazard> say
[9:58] <Subhazard> 500,000 people
[9:58] <Visiiri> I mean, it's so remote from the current set up.
[9:58] <Visiiri> And couldn't be saved by any means yet
[9:58] <Visiiri> And would cause a server-software compatability problem
[9:58] <Visiiri> and take hours of coding
[9:58] <Visiiri> maybe optimization
[9:58] <The_Lurker> his idea is not possible
[9:58] <The_Lurker> signs are
[9:58] <Visiiri> The_Lurker: maybe not in the way he is saying it, no.
[9:58] <Visiiri> But the user gets 1 block, sure.
[9:58] <Yourself> it's possible, but it's not feasible
[9:58] <Visiiri> Yourself: What I said.
[9:59] <The_Lurker> just a new menu with custom text
[9:59] <Subhazard> That's 14 gigs of space Lurker, not TERRABYTES AND TERRABYTES OF SPACE
[9:59] <Subhazard> And that's saying Notch gets 500,000 players
[9:59] <Subhazard> Which isn't likely.
[9:59] <Yourself> next to the map itself custom textures would be negligible
[9:59] <Subhazard> Right.
[9:59] <The_Lurker> it's got to be added to the infinite map size
[9:59] <Subhazard> That's one texture loaded once Lurker
[9:59] <Visiiri> The_Lurker: erm, you've just crossed the line to dumbassery.
[9:59] <SubBoy> WEll the thing is it's smaller than the player skin file, for example.
[9:59] <Subhazard> See, Lurker, just admit that you were mistaken
[10:00] <Yourself> the real problem is the amount of additional memory required per block to store some reference to this texture
[10:00] <Visiiri> There are two servers in minecraft while you play: The one you connected to, and minecraft.net.
[10:00] <Subhazard> Don't make yourself look like a dumbass by continuing to be contradictory.
[10:00] <Visiiri> The map and blocks come from the connected server
[10:00] <Visiiri> while the skins, completely unrelated, come from minecraft.net
[10:01] <Visiiri> The block skin for each user wouldn't add any server weight whatsoever to the user-ran servers
[10:01] <Visiiri> and very very minimal ammounts to minecraft.net
[10:01] <SubBoy> WEll don't make every block hold the texture, just have a skin block, and have a lsit of placed skin blocks separate from the level data.
[10:01] <Yourself> besides the data needed to store a reference to which player created a particular block
[10:01] <Visiiri> Yeah, that's where the problems start showing off.
[10:01] <Yourself> SubBoy, that's possible
[10:01] <Subhazard> Can you guys pile into this thread and drop this info off?
[10:01] <Subhazard> I'd like the idea to become legitimate
[10:02] <SubBoy> It's a full integer at worst though, there's more data in maintaining the linked list to store/retrieve it than the data itself
[10:02] <Visiiri> It might be possible if you have an id for every single user
[10:02] <Visiiri> and that simply bounces off the server to the cleints
[10:02] <Visiiri> *clients,
[10:02] <Visiiri> Who recieve it from minecraft
[10:02] <Solece> Wtf, still discussing custom blocks?
[10:02] <SubBoy> Just a server side temporary player Id would be find, that's bound when they join
[10:02] <vurtual> Here's how we do textured blocks.
[10:02] <Yourself> SubBoy, then you have problems when people leave
[10:02] * vurtual (vurtual@74.206.62.26) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:03] <SubBoy> WEll, server reset when there's more than 16 billion, you know?
[10:03] * vurtual (vurtual@74.206.62.26) has joined #minecraft
[10:03] <SubBoy> When it goes open source, there might not BE a "minecraft.net" to get the data from, etc.
[10:03] <Yourself> if they rejoin, how would they reacquire their custom blocks?
[10:03] <vurtual> TOUCHING A DISABLED TOUCHPAD SHOULD NOT MAKE AN IRC CLIENT CLOSE
[10:03] <Visiiri> SubBoy: That would mean no skins.
[10:03] <vurtual> Anyways yeah, infdev saves could have a folder for small 16x16(or bigger, for unique faces) images, for blocks.
[10:04] <SubBoy> That's another problem in the forseeable but distant future..
[10:04] <Keiya> SubBoy: Until someone modified it to load skins from a different location
[10:04] <vurtual> small 16x16 ones, and then folded-out ones that can contain other effects too
[10:04] <Visiiri> Well, the point is this:
[10:04] <Keiya> For instance, the client could push it to the server, which could serve it to the other clients.
[10:04] <Visiiri> The server doesn't send skins to the client, just locations.
[10:04] <SubBoy> I think the idea for skins and block textures would be to ahve the client upload it right quick on connection
[10:04] <Visiiri> So if you make the skinned blocks a different entity, like players
[10:04] <Subhazard> Vurtual, what you missed: <SubBoy> WEll, server reset when there's more than 16 billion, you know?
[10:04] <Keiya> Visiiri: Correct. *currently*
[10:04] <Visiiri> and had the clients fetch them from a minecraft.net jsp
[10:04] <Visiiri> it would work fine.
[10:04] <Visiiri> I.e minecraft.net/blocks.jsp/id
[10:05] <vurtual> Also have a cool limit for textures like 256 of them or so.
[10:05] <Visiiri> So there is no problem for that, other than hours of work for... well... nothing.
[10:05] <SubBoy> Hrm.. That's true.
[10:05] <Visiiri> Actually, when I think about it, it's not a bad idea.
[10:05] <Subhazard> Should I be proud of myself? I lit IRC up with mind tingling conversation.
[10:05] <Visiiri> But the server would be the ONLY problem.
[10:05] <Yourself> and i'm not sure how well separating player id from the block array would work
[10:05] <Subhazard> There's a really good business model in
[10:05] <Yourself> like storing it in a hash table
[10:06] <Subhazard> Have it be an account upgrade.
[10:06] <Yourself> where the coordinates are the key into the table
[10:06] <Subhazard> Players could spend like, 3 dollars to get a custom block slot.
[10:06] <Yourself> that would probably be prohibitively slow
[10:06] <Visiiri> Yeah, and that's the problem.
[10:06] <Visiiri> Because of saving and stuff.
[10:06] <Yourself> storing it in the block array itself makes it considerably larger
[10:06] <vurtual> So guys, should I finish my recreation of qztourney5?
[10:06] <Subhazard> Have the blocks that are used in the map saved to the client.
[10:06] * Dandistine_afk (biocon8600@Bbergerhouserouter.st.bradley.edu) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[10:06] <SubBoy> HRm.. Right, I forgot about that, but have a list of all of the custom skin blocks in a chunk, then have the lsit sorted into chunks by number
[10:06] <Subhazard> Or to the server.
[10:06] <vurtual> Or my slightly less done recreation of qzdm5
[10:06] <Yourself> for a maximum of 65536 users, you add two bytes
[10:06] <Subhazard> The textures, that is.
[10:06] <Subhazard> You can't have too many people in a server right?
[10:07] <Subhazard> So you have a max of what, 25 textures to save?
[10:07] <Visiiri> But, if instead of a number, it would be a name?
[10:07] <Visiiri> Would that possibly work?
[10:07] <Visiiri> Or maybe a number for everyone.
[10:07] <Visiiri> Just a larger one.
[10:07] <Subhazard> You know
[10:07] <Yourself> name would use way more data
[10:07] <Subhazard> Guys
[10:07] <Yourself> number would be better
[10:07] <Visiiri> Yes, I'm really unsure about this.
[10:07] <Yourself> simply a unique id associated with your name
[10:07] <Yourself> that could be looked up from minecraft.net
[10:07] <Visiiri> Then that would be sent to the clinets
[10:07] <Subhazard> I feel like that joint chief in any random movie that has the military. You guys are the 'people' I need to talk to. 'What's going on people' or 'Let's get it working people'
[10:08] <The_Lurker> *facedesk*
[10:08] <Visiiri> So it would be a block[1821389] at [xyz]
[10:08] <SubBoy> I'd still make that ID be server side, not minecraft.net side
[10:08] <Visiiri> yes, and when it hits the clients
[10:08] <Yourself> there's still a persistence issue there
[10:08] <Visiiri> the recognize it as > then the ammount of blocks
[10:08] <Visiiri> and go to minecraft.net/blocks.jsp/id
[10:08] <Visiiri> Yeah...
[10:08] <Visiiri> Hrm
[10:08] <Yourself> if a player leaves, their id is up for grabs
[10:08] <Subhazard> I should really learn how to program.
[10:08] <vurtual> Hey you know what'd be cool for minecraft
[10:08] <Visiiri> Unless minecraft.net assigns the ID
[10:08] <Marach> i do
[10:08] <vurtual> If scripting could extend engine functionality
[10:09] <Subhazard> But I'm intimidated by it.
[10:09] <Yourself> or a server remembers ids
[10:09] <Marach> you don't have to--- fuuuuu
[10:09] <Yourself> and assigns them itself
[10:09] <Yourself> you'd have a different id on each server
[10:09] <vurtual> So you could make decal-creating laser rifles.
[10:09] <SubBoy> Just don't release it, the bigger problem is that the ID becomes redundant for multiple logings, meaning servers need to reset every however many connections.. not ideal
[10:09] <The_Lurker> the closest this idea could get to working is a server crash or dissappearing blocks when someone quits after placing a block
[10:09] <Yourself> it just makes more sense to centralize it
[10:09] <Marach> it's #minecraft! stop talking about minecraft
[10:09] <vurtual> or a pig weapon that fires healing bacons, ejecting sausage casings.
[10:09] <Yourself> why would the server have to reset?
[10:09] <vurtual> Actually that'd be cool, a magical pig shotgun.
[10:10] <Visiiri> Unless it was different.
[10:10] <Visiiri> Like I said
[10:10] <Marach> vurtual: like Heal S
[10:10] <vurtual> it fires a blast of razor-sharp bacon strips, and ejects a sausage casing.
[10:10] <The_Lurker> pig shotgun > custom blocks
[10:10] <Visiiri> It may take up a considerable amount of space, unless it's a different entity.
[10:10] <Subhazard> That's a terrible idea.
[10:10] <Marach> ^
[10:10] <Subhazard> Pig shotgun?
[10:10] <Subhazard> Are you daft?
[10:10] <The_Lurker> it makes more sense than your idea
[10:10] <Subhazard> Do you have no sense for theme and aesthetics?
[10:10] <Subhazard> What? How?
[10:10] <vurtual> It squeals deep when fired, and the pumping is a quick, quieter "oink-oink"
[10:10] <Visiiri> I
[10:10] <Visiiri> just
[10:10] <Visiiri> hit
[10:10] <Visiiri> 4.8
[10:10] <Visiiri> kbs
[10:11] <coladash> yay
[10:11] <Visiiri> >.<
[10:11] <Yourself> i'd rather have signs than custom blocks
[10:11] <coladash> I made my base in infdev
[10:11] <SubBoy> Though I think the main thing is that it's very possible by this point. The particulars rely on how the server is made more specificly I think, my current knowledge makes my opion sketchy beyond this point.
[10:11] <vurtual> "SQRUEE! oinkoink. SQRUEE! oinkoink. SQRUEE! oinkoink."
[10:11] <The_Lurker> with your idea there would be penis blocks and swastika blocks everywhere
[10:11] <Yourself> and those can be implemented as entities
[10:11] <coladash> want me to post a picture?
[10:11] <Visiiri> Yourself: But they would work similarly to the same way.
[10:11] <Visiiri> The_Lurker: Only premiums would be allowed it.
[10:11] * vurtual begins prototyping a new design of the "swangstika"
[10:11] <Yourself> Visiiri, the difference is there are much fewer entities than blocks
[10:11] <Visiiri> Yourself: A grid locked entity, constructed similar to blocks.
[10:11] <vurtual> It will be both phallic and anti-semite
[10:11] <Yourself> so the memory cost per entity isn't as big of a deal
[10:11] <Subhazard> The_Lurker, we could code it in some magical way that gives you free money, and you'd still be against it. You lost face, I get it.
[10:12] <Visiiri> It's funny how The_Lurker PMs me with things.
[10:12] <Yourself> the reason i wouldn't want it to look like a block is that it's not a block
[10:12] <Subhazard> What'd he say?
[10:12] <Yourself> it would make the lighting engine way more complicated
[10:12] <Visiiri> Doesn't matter, he's just afraid to talk in #minecraft
[10:12] <Visiiri> That's all.
[10:12] <Yourself> if you wanted it to cast shadows like other blocks
[10:12] <Yourself> then there's a question of transparency
[10:12] <Subhazard> Give the block simple attributes.
[10:13] <Subhazard> No transparency should be allowed. Empty pixels = black space.
[10:13] <Visiiri> Nah, transparency is above and beyond

[10:13] <Roadcrosser> Subhazard:glass is transparent
[10:13] <Yourself> every time you add something you increase memory usage on an already memory hungry game
[10:13] <vurtual> which have only color
[10:13] <Visiiri> Roadcrosser: Not what we're talking about.
[10:13] <Roadcrosser> oh
[10:13] <coladash> hey road
[10:13] <Visiiri> He's thinking about a block
[10:13] <vurtual> So you could make a little low-poly arwing, or bike, or a gigantic amphibious peach powered by gulls.
[10:13] <coladash> hey vis
[10:13] <Visiiri> that premiums can set
[10:14] <Subhazard> That uses a custom skin
[10:14] <Subhazard> Uploaded in the same fashion as the player skin
[10:14] <Visiiri> It would be very rocky
[10:14] <Visiiri> And wouldn't be possible to save
[10:14] <coladash> hey vis like my base? ^
[10:14] <Visiiri> _yet_
[10:14] <Visiiri> But it could be something in the future.

[10:14] <Yourself> it'd be nice, but i think the cost of implementing it just isn't worth it
[10:14] <coladash> :D
[10:14] <Subhazard> Oh, you guys can change your votes in the poll by the way, I set it as such.

[10:17] <Subhazard> The hell?
[10:17] <Subhazard> Tnt is so easy to make
[10:17] <The_Lurker> nbo
[10:17] <The_Lurker> no*
[10:17] <coladash> how?
[10:17] <Subhazard> I cleared out a hill next to my base with tnt
[10:17] <TrueWolves> Coins?
[10:18] <TrueWolves> Why coins?
[10:18] <coladash> you need to kill atleast like 16 creepers
[10:18] <Yourself> diamond tools still bother me
[10:18] <vurtual> tnt=slay five creepahs an breng me their ashes.
[10:18] <TrueWolves> I like a barter system better.
[10:18] <coladash> then get sand
[10:18] <Subhazard> It took 11 blocks.
[10:18] <Subhazard> I made a chain reaction
[10:18] <Subhazard> You need to kill 4
[10:18] <Subhazard> To make one block.
[10:18] <Subhazard> I kill about 10 every night.
[10:18] <coladash> yes but not all of them drop
[10:18] <Subhazard> I kill about 10 every night.
[10:18] <mnjiman> barter system will work better unless you include NPC trading,
[10:18] <Subhazard> I -hate- the idea of NPC trading.
[10:18] <mnjiman> or make gold worth alot be including it in almost everything
[10:18] <Subhazard> Absolutely despise it.
[10:19] <Subhazard> Where the hell is the NPC going to spawn?
[10:19] <Subhazard> Will it float?
[10:19] <The_Lurker> currency < fail
[10:19] <Yourself> i don't like the idea of a barter system

[10:19] <Yourself> every experience i've had with bartering systems has always made me wish for currency
[10:19] <Visiiri> I know I'm downloading four games
[10:19] <Visiiri> but wtf
[10:19] <coladash> I disagree with npcs on minecraft unless they are non-trading/non-using
[10:19] <coladash> just there
[10:19] <Marach> does the portal elevator go up or down?
[10:19] <mnjiman> bartering system or currency
[10:19] <Visiiri> coladash: There are NPCs in minecraft.
[10:19] <mnjiman> you cant make gold coins just because
[10:19] <TrueWolves> Why not cookies for currency?
[10:19] <mnjiman> they have to have purpose
[10:19] <Yourself> the thing is, if there's currency, you can still barter
[10:19] <coladash> I know
[10:20] <Yourself> so you don't lose anything by implementing currency
[10:20] <mnjiman> there has to be purpose to currency
[10:20] <The_Lurker> barter system >>> currency
[10:20] <Marach> i always thought it goes up
[10:20] <coladash> monsters right
[10:20] <TrueWolves> Cookies For Currency!
[10:20] <Subhazard> I'd like a diablo II style trade window.
[10:20] <coladash> COOKIES
[10:20] <coladash> :D
[10:20] <Subhazard> Shut the fuck up about the cookies.
[10:20] <Visiiri> Until multiplayer indev, there IS no currency.
[10:20] <Subhazard> This is minecraft, not neopets.
[10:20] <coladash> why?
[10:20] <ElectricFuzzball> !cookie Subhazard
[10:20] <Visiiri> As nothing is of value, other than personal values.
[10:20] <The_Lurker> *eats cookies* HAH! No currency now!
[10:20] <ElectricFuzzball> wait
[10:20] <Subhazard> God damn furries are here again.
[10:20] <coladash> I can eat all the cookies i want

[10:21] <TrueWolves> o.O;
[10:21] * ElectricFuzzball gives Subhazard a cookie
[10:21] <The_Lurker> *eats coding*
[10:21] <Yourself> the problem i have with barter system is that it makes trading more difficult
[10:21] <The_Lurker> no
[10:21] <LuciferZ> I'm playing a mod for Cortex Command made by Mail2345
[10:21] <Subhazard> ElectricFuzzball? TrueWolves?
[10:21] <Visiiri> I think it should be simple.
[10:21] <Marach> what is barter?
[10:21] <mnjiman> Take your general chatter to the barren wasteland that is #mcchatter Take your general chatter to the barren wasteland that is #mcchatter Take your general chatter to the barren wasteland that is #mcchatter
[10:21] <LuciferZ> It's a small internet
[10:21] <Subhazard> Furries.
[10:21] <The_Lurker> currency make it more difficult
[10:21] <Yourself> because not you have to find someone who has what you want and also wants what you offer
[10:21] <Visiiri> WHen you die, you drop all of your blocks.
[10:21] <mnjiman> stfu with your general chatter and go into mcchatter.
[10:21] <Yourself> not only*
[10:21] <Cial> nothing wrong with furries
[10:21] <Marach> mnjiman: lol
[10:21] <SubBoy> Whatever is particularly valuable wll be currency like in most online games with trading..
[10:21] <TrueWolves> Your aware the 3rd biggest channel on this server is #furry right?
[10:21] <The_Lurker> ...
[10:21] <mnjiman> /endrage
[10:21] <The_Lurker> so?
[10:21] <Yourself> SubBoy, i was thinking about that
[10:21] <Subhazard> I'm aware now. So go there.
[10:22] <Visiiri> THen you have to place the blocks and allow the other to pick them up
[10:22] <Yourself> might be that rock becomes the standard currency
[10:22] <Visiiri> and if you steal, your blocks can be taken.
[10:22] <mnjiman> barter system is in every type of economy
[10:22] <SubBoy> I forget where I heard what, but something about people trading some rare something or another instead of gold.. to get into a cow level?
[10:22] <Subhazard> Yeah
[10:22] <Cial> Subhazard: can you act your age and not like a little kid?
[10:22] <Subhazard> Wirts Staff or something
[10:22] <Subhazard> And some other shit
[10:22] <Subhazard> Opens up a portal to the Cow Level
[10:22] <Yourself> SubBoy: wirt's leg and a tome of town portal
[10:22] <Yourself> after beating baal
[10:22] <LuciferZ> What is Subhazard's age, while we're on the subject?
[10:22] <SubBoy> Sicne they were much rarer and sought after than gold (since aparently there was good loot in cow land) that was the currency of choice for anything of note
[10:23] <Yourself> you put those in the horadric cube and transmute them while in the rogue encampment
[10:23] <SubBoy> That's right... Crazy diablo
[10:23] <LG_Legacy> Wirts Leg
[10:23] <Subhazard> If I acted my age, I'd be drunk and wearing a tight shirt right now.
[10:23] <TrueWolves> I'm estimating 14~15, he's preaty sane dispite annoying.
[10:23] <Yourself> also wirt's leg is easy to get
[10:23] <The_Lurker> I've got it! death is the currency!
[10:23] <LG_Legacy> So yeah uh
[10:23] <LuciferZ> I'm guessing 17.
[10:23] <Subhazard> 20.
[10:23] <The_Lurker> 11 maybe?
[10:23] <LG_Legacy> Anyone want to do some TCP/IP Diablo or maybe USEast ordeal?

[10:51] <Marach> 1. showed a caek screen on main menu
[10:51] <Marach> 2. still disco'd
[10:51] <vurtual> no
[10:51] <LuciferZ> Lol.
[10:51] <vurtual> I just realised
[10:51] <Marach> maybe running minecraft at the same time breaks it
[10:52] <vurtual> That, chances are, we have it on dvd.
[10:52] <TrueWolves> ...
[10:52] <vurtual> Any movie my dad likes we will own a few hundred times over.
[10:52] <vurtual> Partially, people often lose them

[10:53] <SubBoy> Hey, since I only started using the IRC a few horus ago, any speculation on if fixing water in inf dev will require regeneration the map like trees did?
[10:54] <TrueWolves> Hm...
[10:54] <TrueWolves> That's... a good question.
[10:54] <vurtual> Probably not
[10:54] <TrueWolves> I don't think so.
[10:54] <vurtual> ...also, half the basement DVD and VHS thing is missing.
[10:55] <vurtual> Like, it's just... empty. The matrix is there, some kids movies on DVD and VHS.
[10:55] <vurtual> It's only like, one half a lifetime's worth of movies now.
[10:55] <SubBoy> I was just thinking if it has to sorta palce ininfite water type blocks in the middle of lakes, itmight not do so retroactively..
[10:56] <Marach> yep, minecraft break sportal
[10:56] <Marach> breaks portal*
[10:56] <vurtual> what marach
[10:57] <Marach> running minecraft makes portal disco the textures
[10:57] <vurtual> Also, here's a suggestion on how to fix water vanishing problems.
[10:57] <Marach> like in http://i.imgur.com/hmWka.png
[10:57] <vurtual> Springs in connected bodies of water
[10:57] <vurtual> That jut water up into the air over time.
[10:57] <vurtual> So, if you don't drain a lake too hard, it will naturally refil
[10:57] <vurtual> via underwater caves and such
[10:57] <vurtual> and rain
[10:57] <vurtual> Is bloom on Marach
[10:57] <SubBoy> That would imply a very static sealevel though...
[10:57] <mnjiman> i just dont want the entire ocean drying up....
[10:58] <mnjiman> OOOPS i toke out a block
[10:58] <Marach> bloom? idk. let me check if that fixes anything
[10:58] <mnjiman> SHIT OCEAN NOO COME BACK
[10:58] <vurtual> ocean used GROWL
[10:58] <vurtual> The last time I watched the matrix was like, 11 years ago.
[10:58] * Vis{AFK} shoots vurtual
[10:58] <SubBoy> I still would like a way to put lakes on kills, or in houses.
[10:58] <vurtual> Or half a year ago or less when I watched it, but fell asleep
[10:59] <SubBoy> But I guess if the ocean/large lakes did refill on their own, that would work too.
[11:00] <SubBoy> But then basicly, you'd hae a slow inifite water block at sea level in the middle of generated lakes (since the water would drop into the lake if it wasn't full) right?

[11:41] <LG_Legacy> Dat forest
[11:42] <SubBoy> Took hours to put out.
[11:42] <vurtual> Ok I've confirmed that this DVD was made in 1999.
[11:43] <Mosslander> I couldn't put mine out, and it burned for about five days.
[11:43] <vurtual> All the concents were modified in 1999, the case qualities check out, the disc manufaturer checks out, but... no FBI warning, it's creepy.

[11:44] <Mosslander> Now that I think about it, I should have tried using dynamite to put it out.
[11:45] <vurtual> "How will we stop a raging fire?" "BLOW IT UP"
[11:45] <SubBoy> That's.. a really good idea
[11:45] <TrueWolves> It accualy works vurtual
[11:45] <SubBoy> I'm sure it's shread through the leaves, and it's a wide enough hole so the fire won't spread to the otehr side..
[11:45] <TrueWolves> An explosion consumes fire's fuel scource in seconds, leaving it to starve.
[11:45] <vurtual> it will blow up the fire
[11:45] <Mosslander> I tried patting it out, but I couldn't put it out after is was a full raging forestfire.
[11:45] <vurtual> Anyways B-52, the next fire stopper
[11:46] <Mosslander> Especialy because I had to build towers to get up to the tops of the trees.
[11:46] <underd0g> What is gold good for in survival mode? It's a weak material, so what do you use it for at this point? Just for show?
[11:46] <SubBoy> I ended up climing through the trees and either putting out the edges, or cutting trenches through the foliage to stop the spread..
[11:46] <Mosslander> I guess in a pinch you could use it as armor.
[11:46] <TrueWolves> It's mostly for show
[11:46] <Mosslander> As strong as wood, but you can't make armor out of wood.
[11:47] <TrueWolves> A set of gold armor is kick ass, if you remember to take it off so it doesn't get blown up.

[11:47] <SubBoy> Its' the weakest armor, but it's yellow colored.
[11:47] <Mosslander> nope. quite weak.
[11:47] <vurtual> gold armor is useful because
[11:47] * protodermis (Mibbit@166-235-137-216.mtaonline.net) has joined #minecraft
[11:47] <vurtual> armor has identical protection values
[11:47] <vurtual> better armor just lasts longer
[11:47] <SubBoy> That's true, but then I use cloth armor..
[11:47] <underd0g> Yeah, that's what I meant
[11:47] <vurtual> Gold armor's good for asthetic hammerpants, or for a quick magma-dip
[11:48] <Mosslander> And if you're short on iron.
[11:48] * Rooster tries a magma dip
[11:48] <underd0g> I hope it'll get some use eventually

[11:48] <Mosslander> Can you make cloth armor?

[12:04] <Mosslander> Yeah. I poked arround and finaly found that his deffinition of 'art' only includes exceptional works or art, and that in his mind there is no such thing as 'bad art' just 'art' and 'not art'.
[12:04] <Rooster> Are you using Huge maps or Normal?
[12:04] <TrueWolves> What?
[12:04] <TrueWolves> Infdev doesn't have map size

[12:05] <TrueWolves> Not Indev

[12:05] <SubBoy> huge map in my case (of infdev being faster than indev)
[12:05] <Rooster> SubBoy said indev
[12:05] <Rooster> SEE?
[12:05] <TrueWolves> I'm not palying /indev
[12:05] <Rooster> Use Normal size, it'll probably help
[12:05] <TrueWolves> I'm playing /infdev
[12:05] <Rooster> I never asked you...
[12:05] <Rooster> This whole conversation is weird
[12:05] <SubBoy> huge/deep and floating, but then that's why I like infdev, same size, runs smoother
[12:05] <Mosslander> Yeah, I get quite a bit of slowdown with huge indev.

[12:07] <Rooster> Though with my attitude it's unlikley
[12:07] <Rooster> Just go to Normal

[12:37] <darkedone02> and sims 3 crash as soon as i talk to the eqypt food merchant

[12:39] <Speljohan_> we are open for any
[12:39] <Azathoth> i'm a little tipsy right now

[12:40] <Speljohan_> cool
[12:40] <Speljohan_> i most likely won't underd0g
[12:40] <underd0g> I know, which sucks.
[12:40] <Speljohan_> the sims online failed for a reason
[12:40] <Speljohan_> lol
[12:41] <Speljohan_> i saw it as an awesome concept tbh
[12:41] <underd0g> Yeah, because of the monthly cost I'm guessing
[12:41] <Speljohan_> but the majority didn't
[12:41] <underd0g> There's nothing wrong with the concept
[12:41] <Speljohan_> doesn't the change the fact most games prefer arcade-ish gameplay and instant gratification underd0g
[12:41] <Speljohan_> eg they want wow
[12:41] <Speljohan_> most gamers*
[12:42] <underd0g> And despite that, The Sims is one of the best selling series of games of all time
[12:42] <underd0g> I think it could work if it was free to play
[12:42] <Speljohan_> free to play mmo's are shite though
[12:42] <underd0g> No one would pay a monthly fee to play it
[12:42] <Speljohan_> because they always get cash shops
[12:42] <Speljohan_> which is way worse
[12:42] <Azathoth> i don't like arcade-ish gameplay -_-
[12:42] <Speljohan_> pay to progress is retarded
[12:42] <Speljohan_> etc

[14:03] <TrueWolves> the pits are built in to the wall so I can't even fall in to them becuase they are 1 block high.
[14:03] <TrueWolves> but when you die, your stuff is scattered, and a little bit of it can fall in to the pits.

[14:08] <vurtual> Where would the power come from eh
[14:09] <bildramer> lol
[14:09] <TrueWolves> works both ways
[14:09] <bildramer> actually, nice idea
[14:09] <TrueWolves> if you kill all the people inside of it
[14:09] <TrueWolves> A lot of those people are also programs
[14:09] <bildramer> the machines would prevent a nuclear war from happening
[14:09] <vurtual> Destroying the matrix wouldn't neccessarily kill everyone
[14:09] <bildramer> so yeah
[14:09] <vurtual> disconnecting everyone will result in just confused people
[14:09] <TrueWolves> and some of the programs are kind of needed.

[14:27] <TrueWolves> Ah, the wonderful Fel Mood. If I remember correctly it has a chance of happening if your dwarf is unhappy and taken by a fey mood.
[14:27] <TrueWolves> It's never happened to me, but I once read about a dwarf with a Fel Mood who killed the sheriff and made a dwarf bone helmet out of him. The murderous dwarf was later appointed as the new sheriff and wore his newly crafted dwarf bone helmet wherever he went.
[14:27] <TrueWolves> For the record that was the story that made me start playing Dwarf Fortress instead of just reading about it.
[14:27] * vurtual puts on deathmatchy music
[14:27] <Speljohan_> i concur, but his quite was just ridiculously funny Ausfriend
[14:27] <Speljohan_> quote*
[14:27] <Ausfriend> also
[14:27] <Ausfriend> i think it's quite hilarious
[14:27] <Speljohan_> he did this funny thing at mcdonalds once too, he was on his way home from pub and really tried/hungry
[14:28] <vurtual> Why do I like creepy music so much?
[14:28] <Speljohan_> so he went to a huge line
[14:28] <Ausfriend> that i get more anime and indie games off my physics teacher than an anime site
[14:28] <Speljohan_> so he was there mumbling about how much mcdonalds suck
[14:28] <Speljohan_> and then he suddely shouts out
[14:28] <Speljohan_> "NOT ONLY DO I HAVE TO STAND IN A FUCKING LINE TO BUY SHITTY DISGUSTING FAST-FOOD, BUT I HAVE TO STAND BEHIND 2 DIRTY NEGROS"
[14:28] <Ausfriend> oh snap

[15:44] <vurtual> Anyways brb stealing Snowman's games straight off of his account.

[15:44] <vurtual> ok
[15:45] <Superwafflez> D=
[15:45] <Snowman> vurtual, Steam recently had a sale where all quake games in one package was just $15
[15:45] <vurtual> I KNOW
[15:45] <vurtual> I DIDN'T THINK OF GETTING IT
[15:45] <Snowman> Cause you're stupid?
[15:45] <vurtual> No, I didn't really think about it
[15:45] <dragontailxx> *epic rage going on*
[15:45] <vurtual> then one day I was like "Man, this quake 2 song is awesome...." "........" "I should buy quake 2."
[15:46] <vurtual> Then roughly after getting to the warehouse, I was like "WAIT, HAD I BOUGHT IT A WEEK EARLIER, I COULD SPEND 5 MORE AND GET THEM ALL."
[15:46] <Snowman> That's why my PayPal account always has plenty of money and I always watch the steam sales
[15:46] <vurtual> I have to use a credit card
[15:47] <vurtual> Which requires getting another person who is legally authorized to use the card, and then manually input the numbers slowly.

[15:51] <dragontailxx> And anything you get the information for

[15:51] <ZomBuster> unless you use some fusion mumbo jumbo
[15:51] <Snowman> For looking shiny OOOOH SHINYYYYYYYYYYYYY
[15:51] <vurtual> McC1oud
[15:51] <vurtual> it's shiny
[15:51] <vurtual> and making computers but we can't do that
[15:52] <Roze> Gold aint shiny.
[15:52] <dragontailxx> ZomBuster, it's as simple as reorganising the amount of electrons, and with that the amount of those atoms in a single unit
[15:52] <Roze> There's no light refracting off it.
[15:52] <Codlike> Gold is used for summoning Notch
[15:52] <LG_Legacy> Apples*
[15:52] <Superwafflez> Make logic gates.
[15:52] <Superwafflez> =D
[15:52] <LG_Legacy> And goats blood
[15:52] <dragontailxx> Which isn't really simple
[15:52] <Snowman> You can use it for superb electrodes!
[15:52] <dragontailxx> Ooh!, i want a tesla coil in minecraft!
[15:52] <McC1oud> woods more useful the gold
[15:52] <dragontailxx> That'd keep away those pesky enemies
[15:52] <ZomBuster> monster cables in minecraft
[15:52] <Roze> Yeh
[15:53] <Roze> So is alot of things,
[15:53] <Roze> Gold, has more value though,
[15:53] <ZomBuster> made from gold and diamonds for minimun non-existant noise
[15:53] <dragontailxx> I find gold shiny, i tend to make towers out of it so i know where my home is against the skyline
[15:53] <Roze> GOLD IS NOT SHINY!
[15:53] <Superwafflez> just whack down torches as you explore
[15:53] <ZomBuster> it shoudl be
[15:53] <Roze> Yes, it should.
[15:53] <dragontailxx> Super, that'd only work during night
[15:54] <McC1oud> im playing infdev so it'll take a while to procure a towers amount
[15:54] <Roze> And diamond should be transparemt.
[15:54] <Superwafflez> I mean make two block towers with torches
[15:54] <dragontailxx> I make towers to make it easier to know where i go
[15:54] <dragontailxx> Ahh, good point
[15:54] <Superwafflez> works for me, never get lost
[15:54] <dragontailxx> When multiplayer starts demoing, does anyone wanna start civilizing the terrain with me?
[15:54] <vurtual> Diamond should subtly refract light
[15:54] <dragontailxx> Like building roads with streetlights etc
[15:54] <Superwafflez> Totally up for leveling some terrain and making a city.
[15:55] <vurtual> dragontailxx, I'll give you a more ancient/medieval theme
[15:55] <vurtual> and then creepy quake-style places
[15:55] <vurtual> Hey guys remember when games were shareware

[15:55] <dragontailxx> Whichever, we need to make some sort of medieval city either way
[15:55] <Roze> I DO!

[15:55] <Snowman> Hey guys remember when games came on floppy disks?

[15:55] <Snowman> Hey guys remember when you could go to the store and buy an entire cd full of demos?
[15:55] <Roze> I still have Lemings on a Floppydisk
[15:56] <dragontailxx> I still have a pack of floppy discs lying around
[15:56] <vurtual> I remember when I got a floppy disk as a kid.
[15:56] <vurtual> When I was younger, at least.
[15:56] <vurtual> I was like "omg floppy disk" and I'd store random things on it
[15:56] <ZomBuster> I had TTD on floppy disk
[15:56] <vurtual> and they were safe
[15:56] <Superwafflez> I have a floppy disk with a virus on it I use for fun.
[15:56] <vurtual> I still have the floppy disk.
[15:56] <Codlike> I guess we didn't have enough gold then..
[15:56] <vurtual> Get a floppy reader guys
[15:56] <vurtual> I want to insert my floppy into things
[15:56] <vurtual> er
[15:56] <vurtual> I want to insert my floppy into things!
[15:56] <Roze> Bow chicka bow wow.
[15:56] <Superwafflez> You turn my software into hardware.
[15:56] <Speljohan_> i have windows 3.1 on floppys :>
[15:56] <dragontailxx> I have everything necessary to make my computer have a floppy reader, but i canae be arsed
[15:56] <Snowman> I want to insert my thing into floppies
[15:56] <vurtual> one free usb port?
[15:56] <Superwafflez> Like six floppy disks?
[15:57] <vurtual> You compile my binaries, babe.
[15:57] <Speljohan_> oh and i have slackware on 18 floppys too
[15:57] <Speljohan_> !
[15:57] <Speljohan_> back when it was distributed that way
[15:57] <Roze> +3 to vurtual
[15:57] <Speljohan_> before cd burners were common
[15:57] <vurtual> "Hi, what's your name? You can call me sudo."
[15:57] <dragontailxx> I have a rudimentary card game i started to design on my floppy disks
[15:57] <Speljohan_> mmm pass that variable through my function baby
[15:58] <Superwafflez> sudo apt-get sp0rkeh
[15:58] <dragontailxx> It's quite similar to minecraft in the way that it's very pixely, due to my then being young and unable to draw
[15:58] <Roze> I'm sure i've got a floppy disk full of porn.
[15:58] <Roze> Like 5 pics.
[15:58] <Sparky20> notch has a psp
[15:58] <dragontailxx> xD
[15:58] <Sparky20> psps are crap
[15:58] <dragontailxx> I have a CD with an awesome porn vid somewhere
[15:58] <Roze> So?
[15:58] <Superwafflez> My 14mp photos dont even fit on a floppy. lol.
[15:58] <Roze> Sparky20 - So?
[15:58] <vurtual> "Hey, I've been looking for a good package manager, and I saw you over there. So how about we untar and commit SVNs?"
[15:58] <dragontailxx> Unfortunately, it's somewhere i don't know, and a family memmber might find it >.>
[15:59] <vurtual> That is the nerdiest and dirtiest pickup line ever.
[15:59] <Sparky20> :P
[15:59] <Superwafflez> Way over my head.
[15:59] <Roze> HAH!
[15:59] <Roze> I get it!
[15:59] <dragontailxx> i sorta understood it
[15:59] <dragontailxx> but, blegh
[15:59] <vurtual> basically a joke about his package
[15:59] <Roze> How sad...
[15:59] <vurtual> Then "untar"(undress) and "commit SVNs"(do it)
[16:00] <Sparky20> Fixed commentary maps crashing on load
[16:00] <Speljohan_> not that nerdy
[16:00] <Sparky20> Removed Perforce integration and Manifest UI when running Hammer under and SDK deployment
[16:00] <Sparky20> Fixed exploit in C6M2 where players could jump through a gap in the fence
[16:00] <Speljohan_> "hey, want to instantiate my variables?"
[16:00] <dragontailxx> Haha
[16:00] <dragontailxx> L4D2
[16:00] <Speljohan_> "you can unload my memory any day"
[16:00] <dragontailxx> I didn't even realise there was a fence glitch
[16:00] <Superwafflez> You sank my battleship!
[16:00] <vurtual> "Hey baby, want to sign my public key?"
[16:01] <Roze> Ha!
[16:01] <Speljohan_> lol
[16:01] <vurtual> "Hey, are you a bootloader? You make my hard drive spin."
[16:01] <Speljohan_> i heard a great math one
[16:01] <Roze> Oh, that ones epic.

[16:01] <vurtual> I've done better!
[16:01] <Speljohan_> "if you were a non-linear equation, would you let me derive your curves?"
[16:02] <LG_Legacy> Lol
[16:02] <dragontailxx> Might have to use that on the GF, she does A-Level maths :P
[16:02] <vurtual> And it was essentially someone with dhiarrhea having dhiarrhea-foot-beam powered flight!
[16:02] <Roze> "Wanna make my decimal into a comma?"
[16:02] <Roze> That was crap...

[16:03] <Speljohan_> i read on uni-level in college tho
[16:03] <vurtual> Behold as I make C++ pickup lines.
[16:03] <Roze> "Where's your USB Slot, baby?"
[16:03] <Speljohan_> "let me instantiate that for you, i have the required arguments"

[16:04] <Darkflux> How is this C++ specific?
[16:04] <Bobo> once inf is multiplayer
[16:04] <Speljohan_> it isn't
[16:04] <Roze> We don't know yet.
[16:04] <Speljohan_> lol
[16:04] <vurtual> Because main() is a C/C++ centric concept in popular culture
[16:04] <Darkflux> It's every-centric
[16:04] <Speljohan_> you said main function
[16:04] <Speljohan_> and not main()
[16:05] <Speljohan_> a main function exists in all languages
[16:05] <Speljohan_> lol
[16:05] <Bobo> hmm
[16:05] <Speljohan_> all apps needs an entry point
[16:05] <Bobo> minecraft is good

[16:11] <vurtual> Roze, it has to be a bit more obscure than that.
[16:11] <vurtual> You have to know what the terms mean to actually get the joke, or it doesn't work.

[17:31] * FakeSky (IceChat7@112.201.181.233) has joined #minecraft
[17:31] <Marach> infdev is infinite
[17:31] <JellyTheGreen> Is that the only difference?
[17:31] <Marach> indev is more buggy. more new features, but some still missing from indev
[17:32] <Marach> infdev is more buggy*
[17:32] <Codlike> Lighting is quicker in INfdev, larger maps and Infdev will get multiplayer within a month or two
[17:32] <Ausfriend> Also new trees
[17:32] <JellyTheGreen> Oooh
[17:32] <Ausfriend> funky fro trees
[17:32] <Ausfriend> and it's actually challenging
[17:32] <Codlike> And... paintings are made with sticks instead of planks
[17:32] <JellyTheGreen> Also, is there a way to reduce lag from it? I've used fog settings but too many enemies on the screen lags me quite a bit on Survival test even if they are not present int he fog.
[17:32] <Codlike> enemies and critters spawn in large numbers
[17:32] * mariopro766 (Mibbit@24.100.125.95) has joined #minecraft
[17:33] <Ausfriend> It should be a bit less laggier since he optimized it a fair bit
[17:33] <JellyTheGreen> Ah.
[17:33] <Ausfriend> But if you're experiencing lag then it'll still be bad
[17:34] <JellyTheGreen> It's just horrible FPS when there's too many enemies

[17:36] <JellyTheGreen> It might be my computer, but I have no idea how to speed it up.
[17:36] <JellyTheGreen> I'll buy Premium and see what happens.
[17:36] <Superwafflez> paintings are in infdev yet?

[17:37] <Codlike> just only to a point
[17:37] <Ausfriend> Instead of capping at 60 fps, it caps at about 220 fps
[17:37] <Codlike> I get about 300-350 fps uncapped, and about 60-120 capped
[17:37] <Superwafflez> lets see what I cap at
[17:37] <Ausfriend> which still puts unneccessary strain on the GPU
[17:37] <Marach> horrible! i dont know how you can even play with that fps.
[17:38] <Ausfriend> lol
[17:38] <Ausfriend> Beat Hazard i get a constant 1000 fps
[17:38] <Ausfriend> WITH Vsync
[17:38] <Marach> gaming on pc = :/
[17:38] <Codlike> false v-sync
[17:38] <Codlike> try running fullscreen?
[17:38] <Marach> yeah, v-sync caps fps to monitor refresh rate
[17:38] <Marach> so youre either lying or windowed
[17:39] <Ausfriend> oh i play windowed
[17:39] <Marach> or the game is lying
[17:39] <Ausfriend> 1756x1071
[17:39] <Ausfriend> glorious resolution
[17:39] <Marach> lol

[17:40] <Ausfriend> is 1776x1000 a proper ratio?
[17:40] <Ausfriend> i think mines a few pixels off
[17:40] <Codlike> yeah
[17:40] <Marach> also i FUCKING HATE 1280x1024

[17:41] * Fleur (Mibbit@cpe-184-56-25-36.neo.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[17:41] <Marach> it's WRONG ratio
[17:41] <Ausfriend> because some things need a real ratio
[17:41] <Marach> and in some games it's the ONLY option available
[17:41] <Fleur> SWIPER NO SWIPING
[17:41] <Fleur> o.o
[17:41] <Ausfriend> like Baldur's Gate
[17:41] <Codlike> it's usually 1440x900 then to 1920x1080
[17:41] <Ausfriend> try and play that with a weird ratio
[17:41] <Marach> minecraft has a wrong ratio, you know
[17:41] <Marach> it had from the beggining
[17:41] <Fleur> i hate ratios..
[17:41] <Fleur> i hate math
[17:42] <TerraSleet> Next comes suicide
[17:42] <Marach> minecraft is 4:3 stretched to 16:9. Notch moved the camera forward to make the "effect" more subtle
[17:42] <Fleur> whats 4:3?
[17:42] <Codlike> yeah, the player looks short from first person
[17:42] <TerraSleet> ratio of most PC monitors
[17:42] <Codlike> but looks HUEG when 3rd person view
[17:42] <TerraSleet> and TVs
[17:42] <Fleur> i never understood aspect ratios..
[17:43] <Fleur> I have a 32" in monitor
[17:43] <Fleur> so...
[17:43] <Fleur> lol
[17:43] <Marach> size doesn't matter
[17:43] <TerraSleet> 4:3 means 4 x pixels for every y pixel (i think)
[17:43] <TerraSleet> 4 x pixels for every 3 y pixels i mean
[17:43] <Superwafflez> oh wow 2x4 paintings
[17:43] <JoeMBlair> Yep
[17:43] <Marach> it's simple
[17:43] <Fleur> size matter, you have to have a different resolution on bigger monitors
[17:43] <Marach> nobody's forcing you
[17:43] <TerraSleet> my monitor is 16:9.. its a waste of space in terms of browsing the web
[17:43] <Ausfriend> 32" monitor is 2560x1600 at best
[17:43] <TerraSleet> good for watching movies on it though
[17:44] <TerraSleet> 1600x900
[17:44] <Ausfriend> which can fit on 30" natively
[17:44] <Fleur> 1360 x 768 :P
[17:44] <Superwafflez> 16:10 is better for desktop space.
[17:44] <Ausfriend> which means 32" is stretched
[17:44] <Fleur> im using a vga cord..
[17:44] <Ausfriend> thats not really a 30" monitor then
[17:44] <Fleur> so i can't do much
[17:44] <Ausfriend> oh right
[17:44] <Marach> ie. 1280x960. divide the first by 4, the second by 3. if results are equal, resolution is 4:3
[17:44] <TerraSleet> mine is quite easy
[17:44] <TerraSleet> 1600x900
[17:44] <TerraSleet> 16:9
[17:44] <Fleur> the hdmi cord i had i made it 1080 p :P
[17:44] <TerraSleet> lol
[17:44] <Marach> TerraSleet: lol
[17:44] <Ausfriend> 1920x1080

[17:45] <Ausfriend> thats 16:9

[17:48] <Ausfriend> 480 = 90 degrees idle for dual monitors, Fans run at 62 dB at 90 degrees, marginal increase over 5870 and is expensive as hell
[17:48] <Ausfriend> just for reference
[17:48] <Fleur> speakin of fans..
[17:49] <Ausfriend> a jet engine is about 400 dB
[17:49] <Fleur> mine are unusally quiet
[17:49] <Ausfriend> turn them on maybe?

[17:53] <Ausfriend> 240 is rubbish price/performance
[17:53] <Fleur> best buy are rip off artist...
[17:53] <Fleur> Ausfriend: i can play gta IV so stfu
[17:53] <Superwafflez> GTA 4 is majorly cpu dependent.
[17:53] <Fleur> pfft
[17:53] <Marach> lmao, gta
[17:54] <Fleur> and gta iv sucks..
[17:54] <Fleur> badly
[17:54] <JellyTheGreen> Is Farming in Infdev?
[17:54] <Marach> booooooring. each single one
[17:54] <Marach> running driving and killing
[17:54] <Ausfriend> GTA IV was a horrible unoptimized mess
[17:54] <Fleur> was?
[17:54] <Fleur> IS
[17:54] <Marach> ive heard the same about fallout 3 too
[17:55] <Fleur> and unless you buy the card, and use it for a while you've no basis for an opinion xD
[17:55] <Codlike> Farming is in infdev
[17:55] <C418> fallout 3 is optimized pretty well
[17:55] <Codlike> has been for some time
[17:55] <C418> gta4 has been optimized pretty well since the newest update
[17:55] <C418> but is still slow at times where it shouldn't be
[17:55] <Marach> fix: don't play it

[17:57] <C418> if the original portal works
[17:57] <Marach> does
[17:57] <Fleur> C418: some intergrated chipsets can run games decently O.o

[19:10] <MPeti> I haven't, but I've seen some pics
[19:10] <chazbothegr8> no but yesterday i found my first ever diamonds in indev!
[19:10] <Mirtrius> I haven't found diamond yet, I haven't found gold either
[19:10] <MPeti> and infdev can't be edited, so I think those pics are true
[19:11] <MPeti> yeah, same here
[19:11] <Wervyn> There's diamond in infdev.
[19:11] <Mirtrius> found a little bit of iron and enough coal
[19:11] <Jay0> the screenshot can be edited
[19:11] <Wervyn> Rare, though. I only ever found one vein.
[19:11] <Jay0> but im guessing it maybe true
[19:11] <Jay0> as someone is bound to find some
[19:11] <MPeti> brb, adding 31+31 on the adder :D
[19:12] <Mirtrius> Yeah its probably in the same amounts as indev, its just that you have to manually dig all the way to it so it takes a lot longer
[19:12] <Jay0> 62 :P
[19:12] <Wervyn> Had 23 in it, and I thought "awesome, I'll make some diamond picks!" But afterwards I realized that it's generally not worth it.
[19:12] <MPeti> jay0, yeah, but it's hard to edit the screeny anyway... not impossible though
[19:12] <MPeti> lol yeah
[19:12] <Wervyn> Since one diamond pick is basically worth two iron picks, and iron is way more plentiful.
[19:12] <MPeti> wait wervyn, just realized you're who made the adder :D
[19:12] <Jay0> simply cut the indev bit out or even just paste it onto a createive mode
[19:12] <Wervyn> Oh yeah, that was me.

[19:14] <Jay0> i would like to see it use less

[19:14] <bildramer> CATS SHOT WEB
[19:15] <Jay0> maybe O X O o = sand and x = poweder in a 1 x 3 high column
[19:15] <Jay0> powder*

[19:15] <Mirtrius> only use I have had so far was placing 3 of them near each other, and blowing a hole from the surface into a cave which turned out to be part of my cave system I had mined
[19:16] <chazbothegr8> i never have used tnt and in singleplayer survival probably never will
[19:16] <Jay0> a column of dirt and tnt is good

[19:17] <Codlike> if I'm lucky
[19:18] <Codlike> or I can place a block above it so I dont fall in

[19:18] <Mirtrius> Yeah, either he should make it one powder (since its the same as a creeper explosion) or keep it the same cost, but since its 3 powders, it should be 3x the strength and size of a creeper explosion
[19:18] <Wervyn> I've heard "next friday" as a tentative.
[19:18] <Mirtrius> that would be amazingly powerful
[19:18] <MPeti> yeah, my guess is Tuesday at latest
[19:19] <Jay0> well creepers can drop up to 2 powders
[19:19] <Jay0> maybe make it 5 sand and 4 poweders with twice the blast power
[19:19] <MPeti> but they drop avarage 1
[19:20] <chazbothegr8> i want notch to stop eating sleeping drinking and going to toilet
[19:20] <Jay0> it wouldnt make mathmatically sense to have 1 creepers to be turned into 2 tnt with twice the effectiveness
[19:20] <Roujo> Actually, the way I see it, the powder dropped by the Creepers is the little amount that didn't burn
[19:20] <Marach> powder+! hard powder!
[19:20] <chazbothegr8> i want him to leave his life and jsut concwentrate on SMP|!"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[19:21] <MPeti> lol
[19:21] <MPeti> that's weird
[19:21] <Mirtrius> it says on the wiki, I have tried it and it will just get rid of it
[19:21] <MPeti> I never noticed
[19:21] <MPeti> btw, does lava set TNT on?
[19:21] <Wervyn> I thought it did, but I've never tested it.

[19:25] <Jay0> just cant remember seeing floating fire
[19:25] <Mirtrius> Probably the biggest challenge in this game is playing an indev, floating/deep map

[19:25] <Mirtrius> you spawn on top and can't get to the bottom
[19:25] <Mirtrius> unless you find massive amounts of sand
[19:25] <MPeti> well, it needs a block to burn it
[19:25] * C418 (c418@p5B3D5EBA.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft
[19:25] <Jay0> sand + gravel can help with that
[19:25] <MPeti> so, it can burn on a floating plank for example
[19:26] <MPeti> but of course it can't burn alone

[19:26] <Mirtrius> I think I'm going to build an underwater glass fort
[19:26] <Jay0> ahh yeah then i class that as gravity
[19:26] <Mirtrius> I just figured out how I would do it to
[19:26] <Jay0> usng airlocks?
[19:26] <Jay0> using*
[19:26] <Wervyn> I did one of those recently.
[19:26] <Mirtrius> just fill in any empty space with dirt, surround it by glass, then dig out the dirt
[19:27] <Wervyn> There's a faster way than that.
[19:27] <MPeti> Is there?
[19:27] <MPeti> What is it?
[19:27] <Wervyn> Dig a drainage area below the fort, you'll want it later anyway.
[19:27] <MPeti> ah
[19:27] <Wervyn> Then construct each room, and open a hole to the drainage room.
[19:27] <Mirtrius> a drainage area? I'm talking about on an island map
[19:28] <Wervyn> So am I. There's a sea floor, you know.
[19:28] <MPeti> If you build the room first
[19:28] <MPeti> it won't be infinite
[19:28] <Wervyn> Exactly.
[19:28] <MPeti> because the ocean should be closed off
[19:28] <Mirtrius> Ohh I see what you mean
[19:28] * Arcadiex (arcadiex@74.193.159.221) has joined #minecraft
[19:28] <Mirtrius> that makes sense
[19:29] <Mirtrius> and a drainage room large enough could prevent future disasters too
[19:29] <Wervyn> That mclevel I posted with the adder in it actually also has an underwater fort nearby.

[19:30] <TerraSleet> what did I m iss guys?
[19:30] <Wervyn> Or I'll tell you if you're really stumped. But you can see it from the surface because of all the pretty lights.
[19:30] <Legolord03> Guys: make a 64*1024*64 caverns map in omen
[19:30] * Roujo is now known as Roujo|Away
[19:30] <Kokopure> Legolord03, wry
[19:31] <Mirtrius> so with the whole drainage thing, so I just dig a hole in the sea floor, plug it up, and dig a huge cave under it?
[19:31] <Wervyn> Pretty much.

[19:31] <Kokopure> I'd make an undersea base, but...
[19:31] <MPeti> I think I've found it

[19:33] <MPeti> that hole is 1x1
[19:33] <Kokopure> I only bought it because two of my friends bought it.
[19:33] <Kokopure> it went like this. one friend bought it.
[19:33] <MPeti> and I don't want to broaden it and flood the place

[19:33] <MPeti> meh, gonna risk it
[19:33] <Kokopure> then our mutual friend was like "you jerk, why'd you buy that, now I have to buy it"
[19:33] <MPeti> lol
[19:33] <TKoopa> heh
[19:33] <Wervyn> Hmm, are you sure you found it?
[19:33] <Legolord03> Does anyone know where the Dungeoncraft god room is?
[19:33] <Kokopure> and so when he bought it I was like "are you shitting me! if you two bought it I have to buy it!"
[19:33] <MPeti> I think so
[19:33] <Commandhat> lolwut
[19:33] <Kokopure> and so now that we three have bought it our fourth friend can't not buy it.
[19:33] <MPeti> there's some lit 1x1 hole in a cliff
[19:34] <MPeti> but the place is too deep so I can't really see anything else
[19:34] <Wervyn> Nah, that's probably my mine or something.
[19:34] <Commandhat> In other words you're part of a group that has to stay on ABSOLUTELY the same page.
[19:34] <Kokopure> maybe you found a DRAGOOOOON
[19:34] <Commandhat> (talking to Koko)
[19:34] <MPeti> *looks at other places*
[19:34] <Kokopure> aha, yeah, Commandhat
[19:34] <Kokopure> we tend to stick together in terms of things like this
[19:34] <Wervyn> The underwater fort is a trio of glass domed buildings, all above the surface. It's not supposed to be hard to find.
[19:34] <Kokopure> we all have TF2 for example
[19:34] <Kokopure> and we'll probably all have Portal 2 as well
[19:34] <TKoopa> any idea how far Notch is on the mp?
[19:34] <Kokopure> Valve fanboys/girls, we are.
[19:34] <Kokopure> TKoopa, it's his next in line
[19:34] <Wervyn> Out in the middle of the ocean near a sandbar.
[19:35] <Kokopure> so I'm sure he's busy about it
[19:35] <MPeti> Ahha! I think I've found it this time
[19:35] <MPeti> this thing is defiantly a building
[19:35] <TKoopa> Kokopure Right, but I meant in terms of coding
[19:35] <Kokopure> MPeti, are you playing a custom server?
[19:35] <Kokopure> TKoopa, I would hazard that he has the basicest multiplayer code lined out and is testing it with his wife/girlfriend.
[19:35] <Kokopure> this is absolutely pure speculation.

[19:44] <Wervyn> Go over to the wall of the room, and dig a hole two deep in the floor.
[19:45] <Wervyn> Then dig two over to get under the wall.

[20:37] <Marach> it's like saying the universe is a too big project for god
[20:37] <Mithril> I know alot of good coders online (gp32x.com forums) and they need years to do such projects
[20:38] <Mithril> <Marach> it's like saying the universe is a too big project for god - Oh wait I say that , im an atheist
[20:38] <Marach> Mithril: and what's wrong with Notch taking years to finish Minecraft?

[20:44] <AfroSammy> Is there a way to make 'smaller' worlds like on Indev? I'm kinda overwhelmed here
[20:44] <Marach-00> possible
[20:44] <Marach-00> AfroSammy: not in infdev
[20:44] <Mithril> If you buy the game you get flagged that you can play indev and infdev
[20:45] <AfroSammy> Darn.
[20:45] <Marach-00> i know
[20:45] <Marach-00> there's also a flag if you were gifted or not
[20:45] <Mithril> and when Notch invites you to multiplayer he flags your account for early-alpha multiplayer infdev
[20:45] <Marach-00> (atm nothing makes use of it anymore)
[20:45] <Mithril> what used it?
[20:45] <Mithril> Im going to make a skin I guess
[20:45] <Marach-00> gifted person couldn't gift
[20:46] <Marach-00> it would create infinite chain of premiums.

[20:51] <Kratospie> I found two awesome suggestions on the forums
[20:51] <Kratospie> Glowing CRYTALS
[20:52] <Schaap> Crytals?

[20:52] <Kratospie> yeah
[20:52] <Kratospie> spellfail :P
[20:52] <tinhead50> I think mushrooms should glow
[20:52] <Schaap> i think creepers should glow
[20:52] <Norend> Fireplaces would be awesome
[20:52] <tinhead50> it'd make caves that much more cool

[20:52] <Kratospie> notch said there wont be many vehicles, if at all
[20:52] <Schaap> and lava should glow through a few layers
[20:52] <Norend> The bed would be nice to pass the night in fear

[20:53] <Kratospie> they would give off blue light and stuff
[20:53] <Schaap> na, he should do the vertex offset he tested and made a youtube movie off
[20:53] <Lizzrd> could someone go there and ask me to be kicked?

[21:00] <AnonymousDonald> Anyways, I still haven't found gravel ><
[21:00] <dretch> you can usually find gravel near coastlines
[21:00] <AnonymousDonald> Every big pond I look just has ground
[21:00] <dretch> sometimes its under sand
[21:00] <JackThehat> oh
[21:00] <AnonymousDonald> K thanks
[21:00] <dretch> it seems to be rare though
[21:00] <AnonymousDonald> I don't really have coast lines, but ill search though
[21:00] <dretch> basically anywhere there's water, dig 2-3 down into the sand
[21:00] <dretch> see if you can find some gravel
[21:00] <AnonymousDonald> k
[21:01] <AnonymousDonald> Well underwater is mostly just dirt
[21:01] <dretch> also i'm fairly sure if you go underwater and dig down into the seabed under there is gravel before stone
[21:01] <AnonymousDonald> but ill look
[21:01] <dretch> dirt > gravel > stone was what i found in my only diving excursion
[21:01] <AnonymousDonald> Its mostly just dirt, with stone
[21:01] <dretch> might have been a fluke
[21:01] <AnonymousDonald> Well in indef i can actually make an under water base lol

[21:02] <dretch> yeah you can clear a forest
[21:02] <dretch> if you wanted to clear one, you can set a tree on fire
[21:02] <AnonymousDonald> k Im gonna look for gravel now lol
[21:02] <dretch> and come back like 4-6 ingame days later
[21:02] <dretch> and it'll all be gone lol

[21:02] <AnonymousDonald> what
[21:02] <AnonymousDonald> awesome
[21:02] <dretch> its hilarious
[21:02] <dretch> do it at night
[21:02] <dretch> it looks so cool
[21:03] <JackThehat> Yeah I dont think minecraft really has coastlines atm there is never large enough amounts of water. Perhaps notch will add this when he adds 'regions' :D
[21:03] <Kratospie> I cant wait for night mode in creative
[21:03] <Kratospie> ITS GONNA ROCK
[21:03] <dretch> concerning the terrain i'd love to see bigger levels
[21:03] <Marach-00> there is never large enough amounts of water
[21:03] <JackThehat> bigger levels?
[21:03] <Marach-00> rofl.
[21:03] <dretch> i mean mountains that aren't merely 30 blocks tall, somewhere in the realms of 150
[21:03] <JackThehat> Higher?
[21:03] <Kratospie> Ah
[21:03] <dretch> a higher cieling
[21:03] <Kratospie> well
[21:03] <dretch> so that mountains are MOUNTAINS
[21:03] <Marach-00> say that to people who spawn in the middle of an ocean
[21:03] <JackThehat> yeah it would be awesome
[21:03] <dretch> don't spawn in the middle of an ocean then? lol
[21:04] <Kratospie> cus the actual size of inf maps are you know
[21:04] <dretch> infinite, ofcourse
[21:04] <dretch> i mean height
[21:04] <Kratospie> about 8x the surface of earth
[21:04] <Marach-00> dretch: thanks for help!
[21:04] <dretch> and especially terrain surface

[21:06] <Marach-00> does the elevator in Portal go up or down??
[21:06] <dretch> how hard would it be, anyone who knows the coding language, to implement gravity based terrain?
[21:07] <dretch> like if sand doesn't instantly fall, but accelerates and falls at a set threshold of speed
[21:07] <dretch> same with rocks and stuff
[21:07] <dretch> like critters?

[21:08] <Marach-00> falls smoothly, gets thrown by nearby explosions
[21:08] <dretch> i see

[21:08] <Redshift> eh?
[21:09] <Redshift> you sure about thqat?
[21:09] <AfroSammy> What about caves and such
[21:09] <Marach-00> current generator is a placeholder
[21:09] <dretch> caves will be awesome with dynamic lighting
[21:09] <Marach-00> dretch: you have both in indev
[21:09] <dretch> you know i keep thinking about new ores and other environmental stuff
[21:09] <dretch> wait marach, you mean the dirt and stuff
[21:09] <dretch> falls like its supposed to, with gravity?
[21:10] <dretch> not just dynamite?
[21:10] <Marach-00> both = dynamic lighting and caves
[21:10] <dretch> the lighting in indev is different than infdev's?
[21:10] * Wildstyle09 (Mibbit@CPE-203-51-61-94.lns10.cht.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[21:10] <Marach-00> same, but slower
[21:10] <dretch> i mean like, if you place a torch
[21:10] <dretch> then wall it in except for one side
[21:10] <dretch> the areas behind the wall are lit anyway
[21:11] <dretch> which isn't how light would function as theres no line of sight
[21:11] <dretch> i mean like, shadows.
[21:11] <Marach-00> i never tried
[21:11] <Bobo> lol
[21:11] <Marach-00> shadows? haha
[21:11] <dretch> because shadows + caves + torches
[21:11] <dretch> that'd be minecraft at its best.
[21:11] <Malikat> if dirt had gravity
[21:11] <Bobo> lighting works great how it is
[21:11] <Malikat> then the game would suck
[21:11] <Marach-00> don't expect hardware-accelerated lighting
[21:11] <dretch> not expecting it
[21:11] <dretch> probably too heavy on machines
[21:11] <dretch> but would be totally cool.
[21:11] <Malikat> because there would be no caves
[21:11] <AfroSammy> Yeah, most caves would be gone before you could fin them.
[21:12] <Marach-00> it would be impossible.
[21:12] <Konogan|AFK> Hey, everyone
[21:12] <Malikat> you would just have dips in the land where a cave was

[21:12] <dretch> yeah i guess
[21:12] <Malikat> hi kono! :D

[21:14] <AfroSammy> The "Save File..." option is there, but where does it all go? I've never been a ble to load a game
[21:14] <dretch> it goes into the minecraft folder
[21:14] <dretch> when you load it uses the same folder
[21:14] <dretch> so it should be right there
[21:14] <dretch> if not save it to desktop

[21:35] <Emperor> yes it does
[21:35] <Fleur|Sleeping> nope :/
[21:35] <Mithril> I got a 32 inch FULL HD tv and an older 720p 42 inch
[21:35] <Marach-00> no it doesn't
[21:36] <Commandhat> I got a computer monitor.
[21:36] <Mithril> 720p isnt that bad
[21:36] <Mithril> Its an huge improvement over PAL SD
[21:36] <Fleur|Sleeping> unless you've gamed/watched movies/ and tv in 720p shup xD
[21:36] <Emperor> my lcd tv only supports up to 720 on its VGA mode for computer but when i use HDMI its 1080p.....i didnt know that for a few months, when I realized it it was like a bought a new monitor
[21:36] <Emperor> HUUUUUGE difference
[21:36] <Fleur|Sleeping> vga cords don't support hd
[21:36] <Fleur|Sleeping> I thought that was common knowledge..
[21:37] <Emperor> they support 720
[21:37] <Emperor> they also support the 1280x1024 monitor sitting next to my tv...
[21:37] <Mithril> most videocards and motherboards have HDMI out nowadays

[21:38] <Emperor> so says google anyway
[21:38] <Mithril> <Emperor> also VGA's support 1080p derp - Thats not normal VGA
[21:38] <Mirtrius> I run at some low resolution
[21:38] <Mithril> thats something like XVGA
[21:38] <Mirtrius> I use my professional CRT monitor
[21:38] <Fleur|Sleeping> Emperor: O.o 6 dolla vga cords don't lol
[21:38] <Emperor> then the person who posted this yahoo answer was wrong ;p
[21:38] <Mithril> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e5/Vector_Video_Standards2.svg
[21:38] <Marach-00> is there any point on getting a wii for a CRT?
[21:39] <Mirtrius> what?
[21:39] <Marach-00> CRT tv
[21:39] <Fleur|Sleeping> why is that so big
[21:40] <Mithril> VGA connectors are identical to cables supporting SVGA, XGA, SXGA, and other VGA-based higher resolution standards.
[21:40] <Mithril> Depends what your VGA cable supports
[21:40] <Fleur|Sleeping> and if you have the money
[21:40] <Fleur|Sleeping> to buy that instead of an hdmi cord

[21:41] <Commandhat> Er how do you stop a fire
[21:41] <UnknownX> Jump in water
[21:41] <Emperor> find water
[21:41] <Fleur|Sleeping> Emperor: who would believe someone who posts on yahoo answers..lol
[21:41] <Mithril> <Emperor> yea someone on yahoo answers said they are using a VGA for 1080p sooo - Yeah there are multiple standards
[21:41] <Mithril> Theres lots of VGA based stuff
[21:41] <Mithril> the first VGA was 800x600
[21:41] <Snowman> Real men use HDMI
[21:41] <Emperor> mmyes, anyway that wasnt my point in bringing up VGA, i just wanted to say i switched from 720p after a few months to 1080p and the difference was huge
[21:41] <Fleur|Sleeping> i returned my hdmi cord bestbuy ripped me off

[21:43] <Fleur|Sleeping> is just looks more aliased
[21:43] <Mithril> WUXGA WQXGA QXGA and QSXGA all support 1080p and look like normal VGA cables
[21:43] <Commandhat> I mean besides jumping in water
[21:43] <Emperor> lol not that much difference?

[21:43] <Emperor> much more blurry*
[21:44] <Mithril> <Fleur|Sleeping> http://satellitetvguru.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/720p_vs_1080p.jpg - The difference is noticable. But only at that huge size

[21:45] <Fleur|Sleeping> i wonder if they make 32" crt's xD
[21:45] <Marach-00> supports up to 1600x1200 what p is that?
[21:45] <Mithril> but for a TV?
[21:45] <Emperor> 1200p lol
[21:45] <Fleur|Sleeping> Mithril: you sit 3 feet away from your tv? O.o
[21:45] <Emperor> well
[21:45] <Emperor> not really
[21:46] <Emperor> 1200p would be 1920x1200
[21:46] <Mithril> <Fleur|Sleeping> Mithril: you sit 3 feet away from your tv? O.o - No from my monitor
[21:46] <Marach-00> widescreen? who needs that
[21:46] <Fleur|Sleeping> oh that makes more sense..lol
[21:46] <Emperor> or higher....when you only use the width usually you are talking about 16:9
[21:46] <Mithril> <Emperor> 1200p would be 1920x1200 - those 720p and 480p are crap numbers anyways

[21:54] <Marach-00> Zaneo: most isp's usually give dynamic ip
[21:54] <Marach-00> i had to pay for static one

[21:56] <Fleur|Sleeping> i was raining in akron earlier

[21:56] <Marach-00> no problems with your own domain when you have a webserver
[21:57] <Zaneo> unless they ban a whole octet, ah good point Marach, i thought you were talking about a static ip for personal use
[21:57] <Marach-00> i don't let myself get banned :D

[23:08] <Mirtrius> that and they make shade so that zombies and skeletons don't burst into flames like normal during daytime
[23:08] <Mithril> I like trees only if the leaves disappear if the connection with the ground is lost
[23:08] <Mithril> logs should be affected by gravity
[23:09] <Mirtrius> that way when you chop a part of the tree off, it falls that much closer to the ground?
[23:09] <Mithril> but gravity shouldnt count if they are connected to another log
[23:09] <Mithril> <Mirtrius> that way when you chop a part of the tree off, it falls that much closer to the ground? - yeah, and when you remove one part of a branch, the rest falls down
