[0:12] <vurtual> You know the bad guy in Goldeneye?
[0:13] <vurtual> He was named after the guy who was in the british censoring thing, who didn't like things about the bond movies.
[0:13] <bildramer> lol
[0:15] <vurtual> Also, to get around censors, one guy on the production staff for Star Trek would have them double the length of a scene just so that they could "negotiate" it down to half.
[0:16] <vurtual> making it exactly as it used to be
[0:17] <blaster> Guys I just located a bronze colossus out in the middle of nowhere
[0:17] <blaster> This is gona be fun
[0:18] <blaster> Fuck I am drowning
[0:18] * Knuckx117 (danhemming@c-68-36-60-182.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:19] <bildramer> "I've tripped on an acorn before; it hurt and I didn't get high at all."
[0:19] <bildramer> blaster, to beat a colossus you need lava
[0:19] <bildramer> or a dragon
[0:19] <vurtual> swim up
[0:19] <blaster> FLUCK
[0:19] <vurtual> bildramer, they changed that
[0:19] <blaster> vurtual I had no swiming skill
[0:20] <blaster> I was not planning on drowning
[0:20] <blaster> and I am dead
[0:20] <blaster> Well I killed a giant
[0:20] <blaster> I think I will take out some goblin civs
[0:20] <Darnest> why are there always blocks missing after explosions?
[0:20] <Darnest> like, I'll explode a mountain and there will only be a small layer of blocks at the bottom
[0:22] <vurtual> get novice at least
[0:23] <blaster> K I will this time
[0:23] <vurtual> Also if I make a game that's ever going to be popular, and it has a violence level option, there will be four values. Low, Normal, High, and Nightmare. Normal is what's intended, High is extra violent, and Nightmare is humorously ridiculous.
[0:23] <vurtual> if you pick low, nothing happens at first, but the game wil appear frozen.
[0:23] <vurtual> You can pause and go back and change it, and it'll return to normal.
[0:24] <vurtual> Waiting for too long for an unfreeze will stop the game, and play a video of a guy giving you the middle finger, twice, while swearing at you for two minutes straight.
[0:24] <vurtual> I will sternly refuse to let anyone censor this.
[0:24] <blaster> Now begins the adventures of blaster the second
[0:24] <blaster> I began in a town with 1 intact house...
[0:24] <vurtual> Walmart will not sell it, which will improve the image of the game. Digital distribution will be more popular, so noCD crackers won't be an immediate problem.
[0:24] <blaster> This world is getting fucked up by rampant creatures
[0:25] <vurtual> and news coverage!
[0:25] <kwerty> I sure would like to be able to make games :)
[0:25] <blaster> Another mass murdering giant
[0:26] <blaster> Giants seem to be the problem, most of them have killed over 100
[0:26] * Othilious (Othilious@c89239.upc-c.chello.nl) has joined #minecraft
[0:26] <blaster> But why did it only become a problem after 709?
[0:26] <vurtual> Nightmare will cause random people to bleed profusely randomly for no reason, as well as increased violence in general
[0:26] <vurtual> Including having organs fountain out of the missing limb for a few minutes straight, building up into a pile.
[0:26] <vurtual> then the body can catch on fire
[0:26] * melibe (mel@adsl-99-155-214-245.dsl.akrnoh.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:27] <Malikat> blaster!

[0:27] <Malikat> find out what caused the world to go to hell
[0:27] * Ksg89 (nn@cpc5-shef10-0-0-cust136.barn.cable.virginmedia.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:27] <vurtual> Malikat, his goal is to saaave the woooorld
[0:27] <blaster> My guess is giants were always a minor problem
[0:27] <blaster> But then suddenly the deaths increased
[0:27] <blaster> so maby HFS happened
[0:27] * ILM (ILM@75.97.112.65.res-cmts.senj.ptd.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:27] <vurtual> and one of the weapons will become a machine gun of organs, which has a different sequence for obtaining it(instead of a guy dropping the intended weapon model, he cuts himself with it, and his endlessly spewing bodypart is the weapon.)
[0:28] <kwerty> You got it all planned, don't you?

[0:30] <bildramer> is overpowered throwing still in?
[0:30] <vurtual> well, the short-modern-guns and desert-country-guns.
[0:30] <bildramer> spinning water beheadings etc.
[0:30] <vurtual> AK/Galil, SIG 552/M4/other short ARs

[0:33] <vurtual> not to my face
[0:33] <vurtual> btu they were yelling
[0:33] <vurtual> the accuser refuses to acknowledge this, and they're calm about it
[0:34] <vurtual> I heard a siren and was like wat, but it was less properly siren-pattern
[0:34] <vurtual> it was like it was indecisive of when to start and stop
[0:34] <vurtual> then it stopped
[0:34] <bildramer> ...
[0:34] <bildramer> portal kebabing?
[0:34] <blaster> Vurtual I am worried about this world becoming extinct in about 1000 years
[0:34] <blaster> and at the current rate it will
[0:35] <Animator> Well, I'm having sex with Cleverbot.
[0:35] <blaster> I can never get it to understand what I am doing

[0:43] <blaster> Odd question, when you create a new guy in adventure mode does it use one of the people already existing or create a new person?
[0:43] <bildramer> "Similar story.... my dad went through my drawers and found where some baby powder had been tapped out of the container. He found the baby powder directly under the clearly labeled baby powder container. He still thought that it was clearly cocaine, however."
[0:43] <bildramer> rofl
[0:43] <bildramer> blaster, it creates a new person
[0:43] <bildramer> see Legends

[0:44] <vurtual> blaster, create a character

[0:46] <bildramer> that will be fun
[0:47] <bildramer> I really hope Toady won't add sexual acts or something to make the simulation more detailed
[0:47] <blaster> I hate the new cave enterances
[0:47] <vurtual> Also I'm kinda sad
[0:47] <blaster> They are surrouded with food and shit
[0:47] <vurtual> I've never really gotten a game with shiny things in it
[0:47] <blaster> And its impossible to find the enterance
[0:47] <vurtual> The closest was CIV IV's tech tree poster thing and AWESOME manual
[0:47] <vurtual> I've seen smaller full-size books than that thing.
[0:48] <blaster> Oooh yay an ettin

[0:49] <blaster> The ettin picked me up and killed me in 1 hit
[0:49] <bildramer> yeah
[0:49] <blaster> No wounder the population of this world is falling
[0:49] <vurtual> The only thing that could be more hardcore would be a war room table with miniatures of every major unit type that lock into CIV-colored bases, and fits-into-board tiles that you could use, together, to have LAN party vs LAN party games with an actual war room.
[0:49] <bildramer> "Ettin (Dungeons & Dragons), a two-headed giant"
[0:49] <bildramer> yeah
[0:49] <blaster> Every fucking cave is lethal
[0:49] <bildramer> not really
[0:50] <bildramer> you need adamantine weapons and armor
[0:50] <bildramer> and uber skills
[0:50] <vurtual> or good armor in general
[0:50] <vurtual> or a good loadout of skills
[0:50] <bildramer> :l
[0:50] <vurtual> makes you a hardcore killer nowadays
[0:50] <bildramer> and Ettinsbane
[0:50] <vurtual> Imagine how cool that would be though!?
[0:50] <blaster> Maby adding 300 caves to a 129x257 map was not a good idea
[0:50] <bildramer> lol
[0:50] <vurtual> Two LAN parties set up in different locations.
[0:50] <vurtual> who are opposing sides of a massive CIV game.
[0:51] <vurtual> allies/axis style setup, with a war room and other random stuff, each being essentially a bunker for playing Civilization.

[0:52] <vurtual> People defecting from a side either means they have to play from their home, or go to the other side.
[0:52] <vurtual> The winner is whichever major side wins+any neutrals who are friendly with them.
[0:52] <vurtual> Sweden always wins.
[0:52] <bildramer> why the hell do GPA calculators exist?
[0:52] <blaster> GPA
[0:52] <blaster> What?
[0:52] <bildramer> anyone who's even able to have a GPA should obviously know how to calculate ir
[0:52] <bildramer> it*
[0:53] <bildramer> grade point avg.
[0:53] <bildramer> wtf
[0:53] <bildramer> really
[0:53] <blaster> GPA dont exist here
[0:53] <blaster> So I have no idea what you are on about
[0:54] <vurtual> I don't know either but I'm just an outsider guy
[0:54] <Malikat> bildramer
[0:54] <vede> blaster, in a lot of countries, you have grades in school, and you also have a GPA, which is basically the average of all your grades, such that your overall performance in school can be represented by a single number.
[0:54] <blaster> And so begins the adventures of Blaster IV
[0:54] <Malikat> in my game of df there were sexual acts simulated
[0:55] <bildramer> ...
[0:55] <blaster> Ok in that case my GPA is A* 98%
[0:55] <Malikat> at least, there was one

[0:55] <Malikat> a dwarf woman threw a tantrum
[0:55] <vede> blaster, it usually goes from 0 to 4
[0:55] <Malikat> ran to her husband's room
[0:55] <Malikat> and started beating him
[0:55] <vede> With 5 occasionally popping up.
[0:55] <blaster> Dwarf cancels orgasm: Not horny enougth
[0:55] <bildramer> blaster, just an average of all grades I think
[0:55] <bildramer> still
[0:55] <blaster> Dwarf cancels fap: Detected
[0:56] <bildramer> anyone should be able to calculate it to fucking be in college
[0:56] <Malikat> Dwarf cancels orgasm: interrupted by mountain goat
[0:56] <bildramer> >:|<:
[0:56] <bildramer> what
[0:56] <Malikat> bildramer it's a weighted average
[0:56] <kwerty> bildramer: It's just a tool to save some trouble? No need to get all upset about it
[0:56] <bildramer> ;_;
[0:56] <bildramer> whatever.
[0:57] <Malikat> a 2.0 in a 4 credit hour course and a 4.0 in a 2 credit hour course is 16/6, not 6/2
[0:57] <vurtual> also guys l4d guns=counter-strike guns
[0:57] <vurtual> If you didn't notice yet, this will blow your mind.
[0:57] <blaster> Oh fuck what are the swimming controls?
[0:57] <vurtual> blaster
[0:57] <vurtual> use alt+move to swim down/up at an angle
[0:57] <vurtual> arrows
[0:57] <blaster> Thanks
[0:58] <vurtual> and then ><
[0:58] <vurtual> for vertical movement
[0:58] <vurtual> You need to alt-move some places always

[0:58] <bildramer> omg weighted average is so complex for >10 years of learning math omg
[0:59] <Yourself> lol
[0:59] <Yourself> people should understand weight averages before high school
[0:59] <Yourself> weighted*
[1:00] <blaster> Take a look at this suggestion http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=12889
[1:00] <Malikat> well, considering that a lot of students in the US try to get out of high school with only up to algebra in math
[1:01] <setveen> moo
[1:01] <Malikat> blaster: no
[1:01] <bildramer> that's why that school system sucks
[1:01] <bildramer> *cough* yes
[1:01] <Yourself> also because you don't need 4 years of math or science, but you do need 4 years of PE
[1:02] <bildramer> lolwat
[1:02] <Yourself> 4 years of PE is required for graduation
[1:02] <Dommys> ^
[1:02] <Dommys> "It's ok to be dumb, aslong as you're not fat"
[1:02] <Yourself> only PE doesn't stop people from getting fat
[1:02] <Yourself> because you don't actually have to do anything
[1:03] <Dommys> That might've worked before the Blue Collar industry fell apart in the US
[1:03] <blaster> OMFG there is a cyclops which has killed 331 people!
[1:03] <Yourself> because the only grade you can get is showing up for class and changing your clothes

[1:04] <bildramer> that thing should be illegal
[1:04] <bildramer> I hate that, grading based on how physically fit you are
[1:04] <Yourself> you can thank no child left behind for that bullshit
[1:04] <Dommys> Seriously, one of them tried to work for me when I was doing Regional training for a Telemarketing firm
[1:04] <bildramer> I mean, really, I have weak muscles and stuff

[1:08] <Rooster> HOLY SHIT
[1:08] <Malikat> god i hate disassembling laptops
[1:08] <Rooster> SCARY :O
[1:08] * Marach-17 is now known as Marafk-17
[1:08] <Dommys> And lick your balls.
[1:08] <Yourself> there's also some for academic achievement, but a large part of that was for minorities
[1:08] <Dommys> He likes it.
[1:08] <Dommys> Malikat, why?
[1:08] <Dommys> Laptops are EZmoed
[1:08] <Malikat> because they seem like they're all designed to hide the screws to open
[1:09] * Tiddles (1573599517@189.110.156.161) has joined #minecraft
[1:09] <Dommys> Well they are.. to keep no nothings from dissasembling them.
[1:09] <Dommys> You aren't a no nothing, are you?
[1:09] <Malikat> not opening up the case to replace memory or the hard drive
[1:09] <Malikat> i mean totally disassembling it
[1:09] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[1:09] <Malikat> like, the memory and hard drive access areas took a grand total of five minutes to get open
[1:10] <Malikat> and most of that was finding a good cup for the screws
[1:10] <Dommys> Well, most of the other stuff is integrated into the motherboard.. so have fun trying to dissasemble much more
[1:10] <Malikat> rofl
[1:10] <Malikat> i took the entire thing apart
[1:10] <bildramer> here you need 4 subjects for an Abitur
[1:10] <bildramer> and you can get PE and art >:|
[1:11] <Malikat> the most difficult step was getting the screen detached
[1:11] <Dommys> What brand was it? IBM?
[1:11] <bildramer> and you can even not choose math
[1:11] <Dommys> Dells practically fall apart when you pop the screws
[1:11] <Dommys> HP's are kinda the same.. they just had those weird latches for a while
[1:11] <Yourself> i don't recall if an art class was specifically required in high school
[1:11] <Malikat> the swivels were actually designed with a plastic part that covers the swivelling mechanism and some major screws, and don't look like they're just squeeze and pull mechanisms
[1:11] <Malikat> it's an ASUS
[1:11] <Yourself> i vaguely remember taking one
[1:12] <Dommys> But IBM's, especially those Thinkpad models
[1:12] <Dommys> They do not like relinquishing their screens
[1:12] <Yourself> actually, the only memory i can recall is being in one of the art rooms
[1:12] <Yourself> it may have been after school following someone around
[1:12] <Yourself> i can't actually remember
[1:12] <Malikat> and the last three screws holding the top plastic, motherboard and bottom plastic together were under the screen
[1:13] <bildramer> at least you can choose music without art and without fucking singing
[1:13] <Dommys> screwing in a screw cover is win
[1:13] <bildramer> who the hell likes to be graded on his fucking voice?
[1:13] <bildramer> I want to actually learn to compose and stuff you know
[1:13] <Wervyn> People who like singing?
[1:13] <Dommys> Michael Jackson
[1:13] <bildramer> and not be "lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala" all day

[1:13] <Dommys> People in the US trade Math for Meth.
[1:13] <bildramer> lol
[1:14] <Malikat> and the damn thing camoflagued one of the screws
[1:14] <Malikat> there was a rare earth magnet under a thin metal disc under the keyboard
[1:14] <Malikat> and under that magnet was the one screw i couldn't fucking find
[1:14] <Dommys> Right near that hard drive! Yay!
[1:14] <Malikat> no, not even close to the hard drive
[1:14] <blaster> OMG i discovered a cave enterance to a cavern

[2:53] <Topple> When Infdev goes blank does that mean it's updating?
[2:53] <Topple> Just asking.
[2:54] <ILM> I have to say whenever I play a dev version, it is a challenge choosing between infdev and indev
[2:54] <Topple> Like I'm already logged in and I go to the Infdev page
[2:54] <ILM> because lack of water physics in indev makes me cry, lighting and terrain in indev is bad
[2:55] <Topple> Well, it's a choice
[2:55] <Dragoon> I got knocked into a pit by a skeleton and was horribly slaughtered because I couldn't see and the torches I placed didn't light up.
[2:55] <Topple> do you want to play something more fun or more epic
[2:55] <ILM> more fun, silly
[2:55] <ILM> not really sure what you mean by epic
[2:55] <Topple> erm
[2:55] <Topple> that was a bad statement

[4:11] <EmpiresBane> that's not true
[4:11] <vurtual> Marijuana has a certain level of addiction like normal food and other things you like can be.
[4:12] <vurtual> In the same way some people can get addicted to mountain dew, or eating some certain foods.
[4:12] <AndrewPH> EmpiresBane, learn to take a joke :1

[5:22] <Kratospie> sonic's sprite also looks really out of place
[5:22] <AzureAngelic> which feels out of place in a 2d game
[5:22] <PuyoDead> Graphics look just fine. It's the odd animations, really.
[5:22] <AzureAngelic> yeah
[5:22] <Kratospie> Everythings too slow
[5:22] <Kratospie> The gears move weirdly
[5:22] <Kratospie> and sonics running animation is a walk
[5:22] <AzureAngelic> they're good they just clash with what the game's supposed to feel like
[5:23] <eritz> sega is their own worst enemy
[5:23] <eritz> now and forever
[5:23] <Kratospie> and the gears are 2d

[5:26] <eritz> case in point: valkyria chronicles
[5:26] <PuyoDead> What they did to Shenmue makes me hate them so long as they exist.

[5:35] <Kratospie> SO TRUE
[5:35] <RaidSoft> why bother with arms? just use kinetic barriers and have them hover around you, then you can use as many weapons as you want!
[5:36] <Rooster> You know what makes horror video games scarier than horror movies?
[5:36] <Rooster> FUCKING PENUMBRA THAT'S WHAT
[5:36] <vurtual> That's for halo infinity
[5:36] <vurtual> yes if penumbra never came out
[5:36] <vurtual> then all horror games would be narmy
[5:36] <RaidSoft> oh sorry I got ahead of myself, my bad
[5:36] <Rooster> I played it today
[5:36] <Rooster> It was
[5:36] <Rooster> ...
[5:36] <Rooster> scary
[5:37] <RaidSoft> I don't find horror movies very scary at all tbh.. some video games can scare the crap out of me though
[5:37] <AzureAngelic> penumbra seems pretty cool
[5:37] <AzureAngelic> but im too much of a wuss to get it
[5:37] <vurtual> AzureAngelic, instead of double-handing in each hand, you use your extra subhand to hold grenades.
[5:37] <vurtual> AzureAngelic, did you get scared by half-life?
[5:37] <AzureAngelic> no
[5:37] <AzureAngelic> except for the first couple headcrabs-in-ventilation-shafts
[5:37] <RaidSoft> I guess it's the fact that You are in control.. movies are just something you watch and not something you actively participate in..
[5:37] <AzureAngelic> which doesn't count
[5:37] <vurtual> pfff
[5:37] <Rooster> Exactly RaidSoft
[5:38] <Rooster> It's *your* decisions and actions that make it all the more scary
[5:38] <AzureAngelic> yeah
[5:38] <AzureAngelic> the whole "slowly opening doors" thing
[5:38] <AzureAngelic> is just
[5:38] <AzureAngelic> ehhhh

[6:38] <vurtual> plus intermission-stories and other bits
[6:38] <vurtual> Each essentially seeming like a riiiiideeeecuuuuloooously long map series.

[6:40] <vurtual> yep.
[6:40] <Azathoth> wasn't back when i played
[6:40] <vurtual> it is now.
[6:40] <vurtual> It even has PCgamer-related messages still I think.
[6:40] <vurtual> like how USS Darkstar does.
[6:41] <Azathoth> omg
[6:41] <Azathoth> thanks for reminding me
[6:41] <Azathoth> i've been wanting to play darkstar
[6:41] <Azathoth> never got around to it
[6:41] <vurtual> it's fun in a way
[6:41] <vurtual> in the way that it feels like you're in a place
[6:42] <vurtual> of some kind
[6:42] <vurtual> with some kind of vague physical limit
[6:42] <vurtual> There's a deep interior which feels buildingly
[6:42] <vurtual> then spacey parts which feel kinda outta-shape
[6:42] <Azathoth> like your...
[6:42] <Azathoth> face
[6:42] <vurtual> no
[6:42] <vurtual> like quake 2 sometimes
[6:42] <vurtual> or half-life once you forget that there's a route.
[6:43] <vurtual> I mean seriously half-life is great at making you not notice the plot.
[6:43] <TheClassiestMedic> AMSG: gnight all
[6:43] <vurtual> You just arbitrarily push forward, driven by instinct and better-lit areas.
[6:43] <Azathoth> half life is great at railroading the plot
[6:43] <Azathoth> literally, at times
[6:43] <EmpiresBane> there's a plot?

[6:43] <vurtual> end on a train
[6:43] <vurtual> start on a crashed train
[6:43] <vurtual> end on an emotional rollercoaster.
[6:43] <Azathoth> they sure do love trains
[6:44] <vurtual> Episode 3 is a codename for a half-life prequel.
[6:44] <vurtual> Which will start outside of a train
[6:44] <vurtual> then end on a train
[6:44] <vurtual> which leads you to Black Mesa.

[6:45] <vurtual> Half-Life Zero
[6:45] <Azathoth> you guide gordon through graduate school
[6:45] <vurtual> Revealing his past of dealing with strange forces at hand.
[6:45] <Azathoth> learning theoretical physics along the way
[6:46] <EmpiresBane> you even have to write a paper on nuclear fusion
[6:46] <vurtual> fighting stuff
[6:46] <EmpiresBane> fighting off the professor
[6:46] <vurtual> zombies
[6:46] <vurtual> no alien monsters
[6:46] <Azathoth> a paper on einstein-podolsky-rosen entanglement on supraquantum structures you mean
[6:47] <EmpiresBane> alien zombie profeeors?
[6:47] <vurtual> which he has to use various shiny technological projects lying around the buildings(many of which are early versions of devices that ended up being built at black mesa)
[6:47] <EmpiresBane> yeah, Azathoth, whaterver the fuck that is
[6:47] <vurtual> like an old tau cannon.
[6:48] <EmpiresBane> and that laser-majiger
[6:48] <vurtual> that makes you fly.
[6:48] <Azathoth> let's just beat half-life on coop
[6:48] <Azathoth> in one night
[6:48] <vurtual> It will reveal the background of half-life, in this behind-the-scenes events that take place before the information blackout policies being in place that Gordon deals with in the later games.
[6:49] <vurtual> Azathoth, or in half an hour!
[6:49] <Azathoth> no cheating
[6:49] <EmpiresBane> how the hell can you do coop?
[6:49] <Azathoth> (including doing retarded jumps that skip large sections)
[6:49] <vurtual> THOSE ARE A FEATURE
[6:49] <Azathoth> empiresbane, sven co-op
[6:49] <Azathoth> wtf
[6:49] <Azureangelic> yeah
[6:49] <Azureangelic> sven adds coop to the original game too
[6:50] <vurtual> Then the entirety of MIT is basically mindwiped and that hints at why you probably don't actively act out of it in the half-life games.
[6:50] <Azathoth> why do i have to restart my computer to update sven
[6:50] <vurtual> Azathoth, why not?
[6:50] <Azathoth> restarting is for squares
[6:50] <Azathoth> k. i got sven and the update
[6:50] <vurtual> You're a square now.
[6:50] <Azathoth> now wat/

[6:59] <Azathoth> my friends and i always used to use listen servers just fine

[6:59] <Azathoth> vurtual, maybe i should host
[6:59] <vurtual> I do them for around the world
[6:59] <Azathoth> since you have a shit connection

[7:04] <Cial> Ctrl + C
[7:04] <Azathoth> i have to right click his name and use the context menu to find his ip. and if i try to type or anything, it goes away
[7:04] <vurtual> anyways "connect 74.206.62.26:27015"
[7:04] <Azathoth> so i'd have to basically write it down
[7:04] <Azathoth> but thansk
[7:04] <vurtual> in your sven coopian consoles
[7:05] <Shadaez> im still DLING :(
[7:05] <Azathoth> doesn't seem to be connecting
[7:05] <vurtual> hmmm
[7:05] <Shadaez> i probably get it from the worst mirror
[7:05] <vurtual> it might be LAN

[7:05] <vurtual> I know how to deal with it sir
[7:05] <vurtual> and it isn't LAN, hmmm

[7:09] <Malikat> because you would make it using starcraft-esque models and using starcraft numbers etc
[7:09] <Yourself> specifically, it can copy and paste any portion of a map
[7:09] <vurtual> no, do total annihilation
[7:09] <vurtual> block-EMGs
[7:09] <Malikat> bleh, i don't want to to be bot based
[7:09] <vurtual> that lag as they used to
[7:09] <Malikat> it would be server-side
[7:10] <Yourself> i'm still not seeing how this isn't a dumb idea
[7:10] <Yourself> because there's still the whole selecting units and issuing commands thing
[7:10] <Malikat> you're not really saying how it is a dumb idea
[7:10] <Malikat> okay that's a point
[7:10] <Malikat> selecting units, i have no idea
[7:10] <Yourself> also, why minecraft in the first place?
[7:10] <Malikat> issuing commands would be done with blocks i guess?
[7:10] <Azathoth> hey faggot, is it up yet?
[7:10] <Yourself> starcraft doesn't have mutable terrain
[7:10] <Shadaez> why not play SC2 and enjoy it
[7:10] <Azathoth> (the server, not your dick)
[7:10] <Malikat> because minecraft is a neat 3-d game
[7:11] <Azathoth> minecraft's terrain is too blocky
[7:11] <Yourself> it'd be easier to just write the thing from scratch
[7:11] <Azathoth> how the fuck would units move around it
[7:11] <vurtual> It SHOULD be
[7:11] <vurtual> It is UP in the sense that it is ON
[7:11] <vurtual> it is MULTIPLAYER and NOT LAN and there are OPEN PORTS
[7:11] <Malikat> well, yeah, it probably would be easier to just write it from scratch. .:
[7:11] <Malikat> >:
[7:12] <vurtual> I am going to DOUBLE CHECK the OPEN PORTS
[7:12] <Malikat> however if unit control were mostly AI run, it would be interesting to play with. >:
[7:12] <Azathoth> i am GOING to capitalize CERTAIN words

[7:13] <Malikat> I AM NOT GOING TO BE SELECTIVE IN MY CAPITALIZATION
[7:13] <vurtual> I am sounding like a TEXT ADVENTURE GAME.
[7:13] <vurtual> the proper port is open yes
[7:13] <vurtual> there's nothing blocking SC
[7:13] <Malikat> PLACE candle in VURTUAL'S HAND
[7:13] <vurtual> place WHAT?
[7:13] <Malikat> you're on fire!
[7:13] <vurtual> PLACE SELF in WATER
[7:13] <vurtual> PLACE SELF in AIR
[7:14] <Azathoth> PLACE PENIS in VURTUAL
[7:14] <vurtual> I've hosted for SC before, but it has given troubles multiple times, hmmmm
[7:14] <Azathoth> shall i try?
[7:14] <Malikat> why do people say things are on fire... why don't they say fire is on things
[7:14] <vurtual> because fire is a state of somethign
[7:14] <vurtual> try connecting
[7:14] <Malikat> so perhaps you should say "he is fired on?"
[7:14] <Malikat> like "the computer is powered on"
[7:15] <vurtual> fire consumes
[7:15] <Malikat> so instead of the computer is powered, the fire is personed?
[7:15] <Azathoth> FLAME ON
[7:15] <vurtual> no
[7:15] <PuyoDead> I can't seem to stop playing TF2.
[7:15] <vurtual> the person is engulfed
[7:15] <vurtual> it's ok PuyoDead
[7:15] <vurtual> you'll die eventually
[7:15] <Malikat> PuyoDead could i help you play?
[7:15] <Azathoth> still nothing
[7:16] <PuyoDead> I usually play on weird servers. PropHunt, RTD, things like that.
[7:16] <Malikat> what does that mean?
[7:16] <wry> it means fuck off
[7:16] <vurtual> what error Azathoth
[7:16] <PuyoDead> PropHunt is exactly that, RTD is Roll The Dice.
[7:16] <Azathoth> just retrying connection
[7:16] <wry> (joking)
[7:16] <Malikat> WRY YOU ARE HATEFUL
[7:16] <Azathoth> until it says whatever it is when a connection coudln't be established
[7:16] <vurtual> can you connect to other servers, Azathoth?
[7:16] <Azathoth> after a few retries
[7:17] <PuyoDead> Every few minutes you !rtd, and get some random buff/effect/punishment/etc. Unfair as all hell, but fun.
[7:17] <Azathoth> yes, i can connect to other servers with no problems
[7:17] <FakeSky> TF2 won't run on my computer
[7:17] <PuyoDead> Well, *you can
[7:17] <FakeSky> Because I have intel.
[7:17] <PuyoDead> I think you may be mistaken, Fake.
[7:17] * PuyoDead looks at his intel.
[7:17] <FakeSky> Wha?
[7:17] <vurtual> hmmmmmm
[7:17] <FakeSky> D:
[7:17] <FakeSky> NOWAI
[7:18] <wry> tf2 will run on my netbook...
[7:18] <vurtual> sven coop must hate me
[7:18] <FakeSky> But
[7:18] <PuyoDead> Do you really think they'd lock out the most popular chip? :/
[7:18] <FakeSky> Maybe it's my computer
[7:18] <Azathoth> vurtual, i can't say i blame it
[7:18] <Azathoth> i hate you too
[7:18] <Yourself> well of course it's your computer
[7:18] <Malikat> oh man i remember a rtd server on counterstrike, back in the day
[7:18] <Yourself> it certainly isn't your microwave
[7:19] <FakeSky> Well it COULD be my microwave
[7:19] <vurtual> There are literally only like 2-3 non-xp servers out there
[7:19] <Yourself> no, it couldn't
[7:19] <FakeSky> Anything's possible.
[7:19] <Yourself> no, it isn't
[7:19] <wry> did you place your computer inside your microwave, perchance?
[7:19] <Cryovat> Are all of the third-party map editors 2d-based? :(

[7:39] <EmpiresBane> so... i'm good if i pay $0.31?
[7:39] <Azathoth> then again, i'm not the most fiscally responsible person in the world
[7:39] <Yourself> no, you're still an asshole
[7:39] <Lep> it's really stupid you can just hotlink those games

[7:40] <Azathoth> i mean if you've bought the pack, you can download as many times as you want, but each time it generates a new download url

[7:46] <Azathoth> do it, yourself!
[7:46] <Yourself> i already paid 100
[7:47] <Azathoth> aw
[7:47] <Yourself> it's not worth it to pay another 250 just to get the top 10 spot
[7:47] <Yourself> grad students don't get paid that well
[7:47] <Azathoth> i think you can email them and add to your amount

[7:59] <vurtual> On WHICH CONSOLE
[8:00] <EmpiresBane> gamecube
[8:00] <vurtual> HMMMM
[8:00] <vurtual> okay you live
[8:00] * Visiiri fucks vurtual's dick
[8:00] * Visiiri anal
[8:00] <EmpiresBane> is it on a different console?
[8:00] <vurtual> it is also on the wii
[8:00] <Dommys> I only has a wii!
[8:00] <vurtual> there's no difficulty options on the gamecube version
[8:00] <Visiiri> I posted armadillo suggestion
[8:00] <Visiiri> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=12786
[8:00] <vurtual> the wii version(trilogy) has nerfed difficulty
[8:00] <EmpiresBane> Prime 2 is on the wii?
[8:00] <vurtual> prime trilogy
[8:01] <vurtual> "hypermode"(hard) is still easier than the original game
[8:01] <vurtual> And you have to unlock it I think
[8:01] <vurtual> aaaa I've been playing prime 2 too much, I see a lock-on cursor in my vision
[8:01] <EmpiresBane> ok... it's time for you to stop
[8:02] <Vicrry> Now whats this about Darkstar?
[8:02] <Visiiri> slurpslurpslurp
[8:02] <vurtual> but the sanctuary fortres... and I got powerbomb...aaaa
[8:03] <vurtual> also is it just me or does other m have a different samus voice actor. or do they just sound weird... talking.
[8:03] <Vicrry> I remember hearing something about that game but I forgets
[8:03] <vurtual> or it's just the fact that she isn't screaming at the top of her lungs
[8:05] <EmpiresBane> is there any real voice acting other than grunts, moans, and screams in the Primes?
[8:05] <vurtual> There was a (cut) talking segment
[8:05] <vurtual> and then ssbm had her taunting in voice
[8:05] <EmpiresBane> she talked?!?!
[8:06] <vurtual> it was removed
[8:06] <vurtual> audio clip is still out there I think
[8:06] <EmpiresBane> those dicks!
[8:06] <EmpiresBane> why would they remove that?
[8:06] <vurtual> She talked back in super metroid
[8:06] <vurtual> oh uh
[8:06] <vurtual> because it didn't fit well
[8:06] <vurtual> especially with the scary alien-like intro
[8:06] <vurtual> I wonder if anyone will try to play other M entirely in first person
[8:07] <EmpiresBane> i will
[8:07] <EmpiresBane> i'll do it both ways
[8:07] <EmpiresBane> i'll probably prefer first person
[8:07] <vurtual> there's no nunchuck though
[8:07] <vurtual> so you can't walk
[8:07] <vurtual> it's just... looking around
[8:07] <EmpiresBane> wait... what?
[8:08] <EmpiresBane> i'm gonna look this shit up now
[8:08] <vurtual> and a supermissile door
[8:08] <vurtual> that is just a sensor
[8:08] <vurtual> that magically absorbs supermissile.

[8:08] <vurtual> It's making me think that super missiles are some kind of laws-of-physics defying weapon
[8:08] <vurtual> that can't open missile doors
[8:08] <darkedone02> TF2 pisses me off when you got a suckload of people in your team and you losing the game constently.
[8:08] <darkedone02> almost to always being steamrolled.
[8:09] <EmpiresBane> this game is gonna suck ass
[8:09] <darkedone02> which game?
[8:09] <vede> Hm. So apparently Skulltag is on the way to becoming an open source project.
[8:09] <EmpiresBane> Metroid: The Other M
[8:09] <vurtual> try opening a red door with a superm issile in prime 2
[8:09] <vurtual> it bounces off
[8:09] <vurtual> I have no idea why
[8:10] <darkedone02> hmm
[8:10] <darkedone02> vurtual, what are you playing?
[8:10] <vurtual> I'm watching a video right now
[8:10] <darkedone02> sound like something like defcon

[9:15] <outsomnia> Correction, corpses don't have rights, ghosts are still fine though.
[9:16] <Zuggy> Yeah. The ghost is the actual person. The corpse is just the body they left behind.
[9:16] <outsomnia> Corpses are inanimate and unable to think for themselves,
[9:16] <vede> Read dat shit. As of 2004, people with the common disorder known as 'existential difficulty' are to be treated just as any other citizen would.

[10:20] * TrueWolves patpats his computer, he wonders how it continues to function 24/7 like it does.
[10:20] <Zuggy> Indeed.
[10:20] <Speljohan_> i have enough ram/cpu to see no difference in performance between vista and win7
[10:21] <Zuggy> I've seen Vista PCs on low ram like that. It's not a pretty sight.
[10:21] <Speljohan_> kinda like xp on bare minimum
[10:21] <Speljohan_> :P
[10:21] <Zuggy> I ran XP on a computer with 512 MB ram, and a 1.3GHz CPU.
[10:21] <Zuggy> It ran just fine.
[10:21] <Speljohan_> that's far from bare minimum
[10:21] <TrueWolves> my CPU is just fine
[10:21] <Speljohan_> bare minimum is 96mb ram
[10:22] <TrueWolves> my RAM isn't
[10:22] <Zuggy> Oh.
[10:22] <Speljohan_> and 500mhz cpu
[10:22] <Speljohan_> err
[10:22] <Speljohan_> 450*
[10:22] <Speljohan_> or sumthin
[10:22] <Speljohan_> cant remember cpu
[10:22] <TrueWolves> I got a 2.4GHz cpu
[10:22] <Zuggy> Well, my computer was the cheapest I could get from Dell at the time.
[10:22] <Speljohan_> when xp was released, 256mb ram was standard
[10:22] <Speljohan_> err
[10:22] <Speljohan_> 128mb was
[10:22] <Speljohan_> 256 for high end
[10:22] <Speljohan_> and 512 for super-high end
[10:22] <TrueWolves> haha
[10:23] <Speljohan_> and p4 2.0ghz was the most powerful cpu on the market
[10:23] * TrueWolves has around 890mb on his computer, it started as a gig but it's been eaten away slowly over 2 years
[10:23] <Speljohan_> its funny cos xp didnt run very well even with a maxed out monster at the time
[10:23] <Zuggy> Anyone know of/own a game called Sleep is Death?
[10:23] <TrueWolves> I know of it
[10:23] <Speljohan_> hence why the market went into a huge boom
[10:23] <Speljohan_> err
[10:23] <Speljohan_> rush*
[10:23] <Speljohan_> where everything got cheaper

[10:24] <TrueWolves> ._.
[10:24] <Speljohan_> :P
[10:24] <Speljohan_> ram is cheap
[10:24] <Speljohan_> no reason not to upgrade
[10:25] * TrueWolves is going to beat Iji on ultimoral on turbo and stream it the momment he has 4gigs of RAM
[10:25] <TrueWolves> sure this is
[10:25] <TrueWolves> complete lack of money. =/
[10:25] <Speljohan_> i purchased 8gb ram about 1 year ago for $150 or so
[10:25] <Othilious> Actually, the price of RAM has been going up :/
[10:25] <Speljohan_> really
[10:25] <Othilious> Yeah
[10:25] <Speljohan_> good thing i bought when i did then!
[10:25] <Speljohan_> cause it was at an all-time low
[10:25] * TrueWolves has no money, so it don't matter to him what the price is
[10:25] <Zuggy> It's a lot cheaper to build a PC nowadays than it was a few years ago.
[10:25] <Othilious> A year ago I bought a stick of 2g DDR3 for 50 odd bucks. Now that same stick if over 90
[10:26] <Speljohan_> Zuggy actually the price has been quite stable for a year or two now
[10:26] <Zuggy> I remember when $2000 was what you had to shell out to get decent parts, now you can get decent stuff for like $600.
[10:26] <Speljohan_> but yeah
[10:26] <TrueWolves> 600 dollars I do not have, 3=
[10:26] <Speljohan_> it has stagnated

[10:30] <Speljohan_> multiple failsafes!
[10:30] <Naserve> MGS2 was my favorite. 4 had some things going for it but I just didn't love it like I loved MGS2
[10:30] <Zuggy> Yeah.
[10:30] <Zuggy> I laugh at people who are like "Raiden sucked in MGS2, but he's awesome in 4".
[10:30] <Zuggy> He was awesome in 2, then he took several levels in Badass.
[10:31] <Naserve> He was stupid in 4. He was a lot cooler in 2, although I would have rather played as Snake more
[10:31] <Speljohan_> i was still mind blown by the story in mgs1
[10:31] <Speljohan_> !
[10:31] <Speljohan_> best game-story of its time
[10:31] <Zuggy> 3 was almost my favorite, but the whole limited use silencers thing put me off.
[10:31] <TrueWolves> mgs has a mind screw of a story in general
[10:32] <Zuggy> Since I can't play MGS without stealthing the whole thing.
[10:32] <Speljohan_> well written story though TrueWolves
[10:32] <Naserve> I didn't really like 3 all that much.
[10:32] <TrueWolves> indeed it is
[10:32] <Speljohan_> if there's any game that could become a good movie it would be mgs1
[10:32] <Speljohan_> but then
[10:32] <Zuggy> They're making one, or so I hear.
[10:32] <Speljohan_> if hollywood did it i bet they would use like bruce willis as the protagonist
[10:32] <Speljohan_> and make it all action
[10:32] <Speljohan_> :/
[10:33] <Zuggy> I'll see it, but unless David Hayter has something to do with it, I probably won't like it.

[11:20] <TrueWolves> somewhere out there is a person with 190 IQ... and someone with 10 IQ...
[11:21] <Speljohan_> correct
[11:21] <Speljohan_> xcept
[11:21] <Speljohan_> you couldn't even open a door with 10 IQ
[11:21] <Speljohan_> so i feel sorry for that person
[11:21] <Yourself> IQs are relative
[11:21] <TrueWolves> When are population reachs about 150~200 trillion
[11:21] <TrueWolves> someone will have a negative -1 IQ
[11:21] <Yourself> there is the dumbest person on earth
[11:21] <Yourself> and that person will have a 10 IQ
[11:21] <Speljohan_> xcept we will never reach that TrueWolves
[11:21] <Speljohan_> nowhere near
[11:21] <Yourself> doesn't matter how smart they actually are
[11:22] <TrueWolves> Your correct Yourself
[11:22] <kwerty> Is it normal for the game to create random creatures inside the cave when they are big enough? A sheep, a pig and a zombie spawned in my cave even though there are no connections to the outside world
[11:22] <TrueWolves> I'm basing it off the standard, the mid point being 100, and the standard deviation being 15
[11:22] <TrueWolves> Given a population of 6.8 billion
[11:22] <Rithiur> kwerty: Monsters are spawned in all dark areas.
[11:22] <TrueWolves> The highest current IQ is about 190.5 and the lowest 9.5
[11:22] <kwerty> Rithiur: But I had torches everywhere :(
[11:23] <TrueWolves> sheep and pigs spawn whereever there is plants, zombies spawn in the tinist dark places

[11:25] <Speljohan_> well, iq is just a measurement for how logically you can think and how fast

[11:25] <Speljohan_> the accepted definition is what i said tho

[13:09] <eritz> if that wasn't true, the other 80% of the time would be silence
[13:09] <Speljohan_> tversity had trouble with mkv hd videos :(
[13:09] <Malikat> wait are we talking about 9.11?
[13:09] <Speljohan_> so i had to convert the damn thing
[13:09] <Speljohan_> to xvid
[13:09] <eritz> tversity was actually the first thing i tried, way back when i was trying to stream to my xbox 360
[13:09] <TrueWolves> ... oddly worded but true eritz
[13:10] <Malikat> if so i am obligated by membership in certain conspiracies to say NOTHING WAS ODD ABOUT 9.11!
[13:10] <Speljohan_> i've had no trouble with tversity except matroska support eritz
[13:10] <Speljohan_> the rest works fine
[13:10] <eritz> how long have you been using it?
[13:10] * TrueWolves disapears in a poof of pixels
[13:10] <Speljohan_> about a year
[13:10] <eritz> i haven't used it in at least two years
[13:10] <eritz> it's probably come a long way
[13:10] <Speljohan_> probably
[13:10] <Speljohan_> it's the only thing i use my xbox for lol
[13:11] <Caleo> So, random question here... what name is better: Niles or Webb?
[13:11] <Speljohan_> i never play games
[13:11] <Speljohan_> it's just a great media device
[13:11] <eritz> well, i recently picked up a nettop to run XBMC on
[13:11] <Speljohan_> myb i should try xmbc
[13:11] <eritz> it's a frustrating, tricky project... but i love frustrating, tricky projects
[13:11] <Speljohan_> xbmc*
[13:11] <eritz> it gives me something to do
[13:11] <eritz> something to think about
[13:11] <Malikat> okay i am going to watch mortal kombat until i pass out
[13:11] <Shadaez> XBMC?
[13:11] <eritz> fairly cheap, too
[13:11] <Shadaez> I thought that was Xbox media center
[13:12] <Malikat> stream (y/n)?
[13:12] <eritz> $200 for the computer, $30 for RAM, and $20 for a remote
[13:12] <eritz> XBMC has since been 'ported' to mac, linux, and PC
[13:12] <quaxar> Xbmc is pretty good
[13:12] <eritz> in fact, main-line support for the xbox platform has been discontinued
[13:13] <quaxar> yeah because you cant improve it
[13:13] <quaxar> not enough ram and processing power
[13:13] <eritz> well, you technically CAN
[13:13] <eritz> it's just very, very difficult
[13:13] <eritz> and it still doesn't get you very far
[13:13] <quaxar> Yeah but it probably wouldent improve anything other than skinning
[13:14] <quaxar> I just use my xbox for gba games now
[13:14] <Speljohan_> i cant do that
[13:14] <Speljohan_> cus xbox 360
[13:14] <eritz> i use my GBA for that
[13:14] <Speljohan_> they still havent unlocked it
[13:14] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:14] <quaxar> Yes they did
[13:14] <Speljohan_> stupid proprietary shit
[13:14] <Caleo> seriously, I could use some votes... name: Niles or Webb?
[13:14] * UltimateBudgie (IceChat7@c122-107-229-26.mckinn3.vic.optusnet.com.au) Quit (Quit: Pull the pin and count to what?)
[13:14] <quaxar> You can mod a xbox 369
[13:14] <Speljohan_> no quaxar, only the first revision or sumthin
[13:14] <quaxar> it requires a prarallell port
[13:14] * KrimZon (krimzon@93-97-68-96.zone5.bethere.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
[13:14] <quaxar> I have the first revision
[13:14] <quaxar> so I can do it
[13:14] <Speljohan_> oh
[13:14] <eritz> 'prarallell'?
[13:14] <quaxar> hdmi versions cant
[13:14] <Speljohan_> i have like
[13:14] <eritz> jesus christ
[13:14] <Speljohan_> a latest version
[13:15] <quaxar> I have a moddable version , it requires I think 6 wires
[13:15] <Speljohan_> gay microsoft being so proprietary
[13:15] <Speljohan_> :/
[13:15] <quaxar> and a parallel port
[13:15] <quaxar> And you have to run a program for 4 hours
[13:16] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:16] <quaxar> to find your xbox's specific soemthing code
[13:16] <Speljohan_> too much work
[13:16] <quaxar> and then it can write that signature on a rom and reprogram it
[13:16] <quaxar> something like that
[13:16] <TrueWolves> ...
[13:16] * TrueWolves 's RAM history just... did something... odd
[13:16] <eritz> what i've got going is something like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg5WjGmzMDU
[13:17] <quaxar> I was going to buy one of those
[13:17] <eritz> i have the computer pictured
[13:17] <Caleo> ...
[13:17] <quaxar> but Im gonna buy a via nano mobo instead

[13:17] <quaxar> because I dont want to support intel ever
[13:17] <Caleo> people ignoring me -.- it's not very hard, what sounds better: Niles or Webb?
[13:17] <eritz> except, unlike the owner of that particular computer, i have not yet installed a second gigabyte of RAM
[13:18] <Shadaez> neiihter
[13:18] <eritz> the ION chipset in that computer, and those like it, are easily the cheapest way to do 1080p
[13:18] <Shadaez> ion is awesome :D
[13:18] <Caleo> -.-
[13:19] <Shadaez> I really want an ion Tablet PC to come out
[13:19] <eritz> but yeah, i'm having some issues with running XBMC on that
[13:20] <eritz> mostly due to the non-standard builds i've been trying to use, my lack of a second GB of RAM, and my flaky disc drive solution
[13:20] <KrimZon> Caleo: they both sound about the same
[13:21] <KrimZon> is it a trick question - are they identical?
[13:21] <Caleo> Well, someone pointed out to me that Niles sounds like a gay british explorer
[13:21] <Caleo> that kind of taints it XD
[13:21] <eritz> NTTATWWT
[13:24] <TrueWolves> ...
[13:24] <TrueWolves> Windows Vista has a sticky note application?
[13:25] <eritz> hmm... so the MKV handling bug was fixed four months ago...
[13:26] <eritz> and 9.11 was released... six months ago
[13:26] <eritz> yep, looks like it's a nightly build for me
[13:26] <eritz> and, for what it's worth, that sticky note application is a lot more useful than you'd think
[13:27] <TrueWolves> I've had this computer over 2 years and never knew it exsisted
[13:28] <TrueWolves> I can already think of a lot of uses for it, given it has a "Open on start up" option

[13:28] <eritz> its... well... it's like a sticky note, on your computer screen
[13:28] <Speljohan_> real men use vi
[13:28] <TrueWolves> I could care less about the shiny, but... yeah it's kind of useful
[13:29] <eritz> useful for all the same reasons actual sticky notes are useful
[13:29] <kwerty> But doesn't use up the resources needed to make actual sticky notes! Hooray for saving the world!
[13:30] <TrueWolves> Can you type on it?
[13:30] * TrueWolves only has figured out the pen and voice functions
[13:30] <TrueWolves> How the hell did I not know about this thing for 2 years...
[13:30] <Shadaez> i just make a .txt document, lol
[13:30] <Shadaez> I think all the widget crap's dumb
[13:30] <TrueWolves> I had a .txt document that I stoped checking

[13:30] <eritz> widgets SEEM dumb
[13:31] <eritz> but, once you get the hang of them, and figure out when and where to apply them, they're pretty cool
[13:31] <Speljohan_> i never found any use for them
[13:31] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:31] * vede (joshua@wsip-174-79-147-235.tu.ok.cox.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:31] <eritz> well, i actually run my PC without a taskbar
[13:31] <Shadaez> like
[13:31] <eritz> so an external clock is very helpful to me
[13:31] <Speljohan_> sounds tedius
[13:31] <Shadaez> I currently have asdf.txt on my desktop
[13:31] <Speljohan_> tedious*
[13:32] <eritz> it's tedious occasionally
[13:32] <eritz> but it usually works pretty well
[13:32] <Speljohan_> i have about 9 of those documents Shadaez
[13:32] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:32] <TrueWolves> I usualy drop the task bar as well, but only becuase Vista's explorer.exe has problems
[13:32] <Shadaez> that's my sticky note, and it uses no resources
[13:32] <LG_Legacy> A barrel roll?
[13:32] <Speljohan_> one is full of passwords nd shit
[13:32] <eritz> i made an autohotkey script for all my most commonly-used programs
[13:32] <TrueWolves> LG!
[13:32] <kwerty> I turned the widgets off as I booted windows for the first time. But I can see why they can be useful for some
[13:32] <TrueWolves> Change the topic, today's May 10th!
[13:32] <eritz> i don't need taskbars OR icons anymore, for the most part
[13:32] <TrueWolves> The release of the first version of minecraft, =D
[13:33] <Speljohan_> the only time i never use visual stuff is when i use linux
[13:33] <Speljohan_> cus i am so used to terminal
[13:33] <Naserve> We talked about that like three hours ago TrueWolves
[13:33] <Shadaez> I wish more people used linux. It would be perfect for my parents, and 65% of people
[13:33] <eritz> when i'm not working on anything, i see my wallpaper, and nothing else
[13:33] <kwerty> Shadaez: Why is that?
[13:33] <Speljohan_> perfect for 15% of people*
[13:33] * TrueWolves disapears in a cloud of pixels
[13:33] <Speljohan_> cus vast majority of home pc users are gamers
[13:34] <Speljohan_> it would not suit them well
[13:34] <Shadaez> not really

[13:34] <Shadaez> my mom uses an internet browser, and that's it
[13:34] <Speljohan_> there's a reason the gaming market is the leading industry for technological advancement
[13:34] <eritz> you overestimate gamers
[13:34] <Speljohan_> Shadaez that's your mom
[13:34] <eritz> demographics overestimate themselves constantly
[13:34] <Flesh> actually
[13:34] <Flesh> porn is the main driver
[13:34] <Speljohan_> not the 20 geeks with 3 pc's each in their basement
[13:35] <Speljohan_> geeking every weekend
[13:35] <Speljohan_> nomsayin'
[13:35] <Shadaez> I also said 65%
[13:35] <Speljohan_> sounds very much like an overstatement
[13:35] <eritz> the geeks are a lot less common than the moms
[13:35] <Shadaez> i know
[13:35] <eritz> it's really not an overstatement
[13:35] <eritz> i gave ubuntu to my dad
[13:35] <Shadaez> do your parents use a PC? What do they do on it?
[13:35] <eritz> suits him just fine
[13:35] <Speljohan_> my dad rarely uses a pc
[13:35] <Shadaez> and when he does?
[13:36] <Speljohan_> surfing obviously
[13:36] <Speljohan_> but it's about demographics
[13:36] <Speljohan_> but then
[13:36] <eritz> uhh
[13:36] <eritz> linux would be perfect for your dad, then
[13:36] <Speljohan_> i forgot to take facebook and other dumb shit into account
[13:36] <Speljohan_> so yeah
[13:36] <Speljohan_> i guess gaming isn't the prime market afterall
[13:36] <eritz> also, linux is bulletproof compared to windows
[13:36] <kwerty> Shadaez: My dad plays Halo online. And he uses the same machine with our home studio to record guitar tracks
[13:36] <kwerty> Linux is not an option
[13:37] <Speljohan_> i can verify that
[13:37] <Shadaez> yeah, well, most parents aren't into that stuff
[13:37] <Speljohan_> guitar recording in linux is terrible
[13:37] <Speljohan_> i've tried
[13:37] <Speljohan_> and you never get the desired outcome
[13:37] <Shadaez> ubuntu works fine for most casual pc users
[13:37] <Speljohan_> i wouldn't touch ubuntu with a 10 feet pole though
[13:37] <Speljohan_> might as well run windows xp
[13:37] <Shadaez> why
[13:37] <eritz> ubuntu is fine
[13:37] <Speljohan_> both share one thing
[13:37] <kwerty> Ubuntu is way too heavy :F
[13:38] <Speljohan_> they are bloated and slow
[13:38] <eritz> you can get a minimal version of ubuntu
[13:38] <Speljohan_> :>
[13:38] <Speljohan_> or you can get a decent os like arch
[13:38] <Speljohan_> or gentoo
[13:38] <Speljohan_> or any other lightweight distro
[13:38] <Shadaez> fine
[13:38] <TrueWolves> How importent would you guys say the Windows Defender Service on a computer is?
[13:38] <Shadaez> not very
[13:38] <Speljohan_> i dont even know what it is
[13:38] <TrueWolves> It's eating a ton of my cpu for soem reason.
[13:38] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:38] <kwerty> I like linux since it's open source. I generally pick an open-source alternative for anything if one is available
[13:38] <Shadaez> it's probably scanning
[13:39] <eritz> open-source is nice sometimes
[13:39] <TrueWolves> That's what I guessed as well Shad.
[13:39] <eritz> it means problems get fixed
[13:39] <eritz> FAST
[13:39] <Speljohan_> i only do that if the pay version isn't better
[13:39] <Speljohan_> and also sometimes very SLOW
[13:39] <Speljohan_> see: eclipse
[13:39] <eritz> that's great and all
[13:39] <Speljohan_> xkcd had a good strip about it a while back
[13:39] <eritz> but several pieces of microsoft softwares have security holes that have been in them since win9x
[13:39] <kwerty> Steam beta for unix is starting next month, isn't it?

[13:40] <eritz> well, security holes are sort of important in an application, when EVERYONE uses the program in question, and it ships with most PCs
[13:41] <kwerty> When there's a native version of steam for linux I might switch my OS
[13:41] <Shadaez> okay, most HOME PC users would be fine with a linux distro
[13:41] <kwerty> No matter what linux fanboys say, it's not fit for gaming. WINE sucks ass
[13:41] <Flesh> actually wine is pretty good
[13:41] <Shadaez> kwerty, jsut because Steam is on linux doesn't mean all the games will work on it. All UT games and mods will, probably, but I can't think of much else.
[13:41] <eritz> and, frankly, if not for the fact that they were running fifteen-year-old software and are too cheap to upgrade, linux would be pretty good for businesses too
[13:41] <Speljohan_> wine is pretty good
[13:41] <Flesh> CoD works on linux
[13:42] <Flesh> i was playing multiplayer yesterday
[13:42] <Speljohan_> but clearly you cant expect them to reverse engineer thousands of libraries
[13:42] <Speljohan_> and/or rewrite them manually
[13:42] <Speljohan_> over night
[13:42] <eritz> you can expect anything you want
[13:42] <eritz> it's just a matter of whether or not you're going to be disappointed

[13:44] <Speljohan_> found it! http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/supported_features.png
[13:44] <Speljohan_> it pretty much sums linux up!
[13:45] <eritz> i'm not really a big fan of flash
[13:45] <kwerty> Flash has some serious security problems
[13:45] <eritz> i would never go as far as steve jobs has, and suggest that devices should stop supporting flash simply because i don't like it
[13:45] <eritz> but i'm not fond of it
[13:45] <Speljohan_> i hate flash
[13:45] <Shadaez> i hope flash dies in a fire

[13:48] <eritz> the schadenfreude is strong in me, though, so i was also amused
[13:48] <Speljohan_> especially considering the fact the alternatives to msn messenger was lightyears ahead in terms of stability and computer efficiency
[13:48] <Speljohan_> all msn has is a shiny shell with an annoying ad
[13:48] <eritz> remember the windows messenger service?

[13:53] <eritz> well, it's true that most people don't know of any other web browser because of microsoft's actions
[13:54] <eritz> people DID know that there was more than one web browser, typically, before the same browser was included with every PC in the fucking world
[13:54] <Speljohan_> yes
[13:54] <eritz> nobody cares when macs ship with safari because apple doesn't dominate the industry
[13:54] <Azathoth> not to mention the browser is called "internet explorer"
[13:54] <Speljohan_> there was no need whatsoever to attack microsoft aabout it
[13:54] <Speljohan_> because
[13:54] <Speljohan_> firefox was growing
[13:54] <Rithiur> Speljohan_: Mac doesn't have dominant position in the market. The major problem is that Microsoft is using their dominant position in the OS market to control the browser market which is illegal according to laws concerning monopolies.
[13:54] <Speljohan_> constantly
[13:54] <Flesh> yeah
[13:54] <Flesh> no
[13:54] <Azathoth> whcih sounds less like a product name and more like a "use this if you want to explore the internet" kind of thing
[13:54] <Azathoth> so i could see idiots being like "oh. i need to use that"
[13:54] <eritz> yes, firefox was growing constantly
[13:54] <Speljohan_> hence it was a futile move
[13:55] <Azathoth> you are a futile move
[13:55] <Speljohan_> just to scare microsoft
[13:55] <eritz> but still, only 25% of the populace used it at last count
[13:55] <Speljohan_> no u r Azathoth
[13:55] <Azathoth> NO U
[13:55] <Flesh> yeah, i'm tired of trying to make you realise what you're saying already
[13:55] <eritz> and most of the other 75% don't even know there IS anything other than IE
[13:55] <eritz> and that's unacceptable
[13:55] <Azathoth> you're unacceptable
[13:56] <Azathoth> fuckin minecraft
[13:56] <Azathoth> how does it work?
[13:56] <Speljohan_> anyways, as i said before, i'm still a socialist
[13:56] <Speljohan_> livin' in a socialist country
[13:56] * eritz retrieves his shoddy IDE -> USB cable
[13:56] <Speljohan_> and i still think it's the best we can come up with today
[13:56] <Speljohan_> well, probably the only thing that works for mankind, assuming the priority of government is to ensure high living standards :P
[13:57] <eritz> according to a bunch of stupid white people who don't know the meaning of the word 'socialism', i'm living in a socialist country too
[13:57] <Azathoth> i say we just give insane clown posse absolute power
[13:57] <Azathoth> that should solve the world's problems
[13:57] <Speljohan_> i say we kill the
[13:57] <Speljohan_> m
[13:57] <Speljohan_> do the world a favour
[13:57] <Azathoth> :O
[13:57] <eritz> no, then it would only be worse
[13:57] <eritz> tupac didn't go away when he died
[13:57] <eritz> neither would they
[13:57] <Speljohan_> true :/
[13:57] <Speljohan_> martyrs
[13:57] <Speljohan_> fuck them
[13:57] <Azathoth> they would be elevated to gods
[13:57] <Shadaez> 2pac isz the best rapr evr
[13:58] <Speljohan_> 2pac was a shit rapper
[13:58] <Azathoth> temples would be built for ICP
[13:58] <mnjiman> holy shit
[13:58] <mnjiman> i went from 4 FPS

[14:09] <eritz> at what.cd, they have way more seeds than they need
[14:09] <Cintiq> lmao
[14:09] <Cintiq> what.cd is great.
[14:09] <Cintiq> but i'm talking about minecraft
[14:09] <Cintiq> :>
[14:10] <Azathoth> seeds?
[14:10] <Azathoth> a farm supplier
[14:10] <Cintiq> wat.
[14:10] <eritz> i still run into people who think bittorrent is going to get them DMCA'd for sure
[14:11] <eritz> so silly
[14:11] <Cintiq> i can't stand people who think torrenting is slow and stupid
[14:11] <Cintiq> just because they have no idea what they're doing
[14:11] <eritz> well, if my only torrent experience was with the shitty pirate bay, i'd think it was bad too
[14:11] <eritz> bittorrent shines when you have a nice private tracker
[14:11] <eritz> with some standards
[14:11] <eritz> i'm in a bunch of them
[14:12] <Shadaez> people just start a torrent with unlimited seeding and DL and think they suck because they lag while they use it
[14:12] <kwerty> Meh, even piratebay is great if you want to get something popular
[14:12] <Shadaez> Waffles.FM > what.cd :D
[14:12] <Speljohan_> i prefer premium service
[14:12] <Speljohan_> so i dont use torrents
[14:12] <eritz> there are better places to get something popular than TPB
[14:12] <eritz> like any 0-day private tracker
[14:12] <Cintiq> torrentleech is pretty good
[14:12] <Speljohan_> i used to be on torrentleech
[14:12] <eritz> because there, you get fast releases, AND seedboxers whoring for ratio
[14:12] <Speljohan_> but then i got bored of seeding

[14:13] <Speljohan_> i used to dl like 260gb/mo from there
[14:13] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:13] <eritz> i was talking to my cousin a while back
[14:13] <eritz> and her friends are using limewire to get music
[14:14] <Speljohan_> i used to do that
[14:14] <kwerty> Oh snappies
[14:14] <eritz> they're in HIGH SCHOOL
[14:14] <Speljohan_> but now i only download discographies
[14:14] <Speljohan_> so ye
[14:14] <kwerty> Limewire was hot back in... 2001?
[14:14] <eritz> nobody should be using limewire in 2010
[14:14] <Cintiq> lol
[14:14] <eritz> so, i gave her bittorrent, and showed her how to use it
[14:14] <Cintiq> limewire.. that was the time
[14:15] <kwerty> Limewire and kazaa
[14:15] <Speljohan_> i got picky
[14:15] <eritz> i'm quite picky
[14:15] <Speljohan_> so i started dling flac discographies instead
[14:15] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:15] <eritz> to the point where i'm reluctant to download if it isn't FLAC
[14:15] <Speljohan_> i'm not that picky
[14:15] <eritz> FLAC's pretty fucking cool
[14:15] <Speljohan_> cus my pc sound system cant utilize it properly
[14:15] <Cintiq> haha yeah
[14:15] <Speljohan_> cus shitty creative sound card

[14:16] <eritz> i have a 7.1 surround sound system, so i can appreciate FLAC a little better than most people
[14:16] <Speljohan_> i dislike surround
[14:16] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:16] <Speljohan_> i prefer hifi stereo
[14:16] <eritz> for stereo sound, i can just set it to all channel stereo
[14:16] <Speljohan_> if i want real high quality music i just use my stereo equipment and play a few vinyls
[14:16] <Shadaez> lol
[14:17] <Azathoth> whoa what
[14:17] <Azathoth> people still use lamewire?
[14:17] <eritz> yes
[14:17] <eritz> god, yes
[14:17] <kwerty> I'm not even downloading anything anymore. If I want a cd I can just go to my favourite record store and buy it
[14:17] <Azathoth> wut
[14:17] <Azathoth> but
[14:17] <Azathoth> it's.... limewire!
[14:18] <Azathoth> jesus
[14:18] <eritz> yep, it's cancer
[14:18] <eritz> i hope to fight it with superior download methods
[14:19] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:19] <Speljohan_> i havent bought a new cd since like 1998
[14:19] <Speljohan_> nothing i like is sold new anyway
[14:19] <eritz> i've bought... a few
[14:19] <eritz> it was under a very rare circumstance, though
[14:20] <eritz> i was at an anime con, and they had some CDs there that i'd probably never get another good chance to buy
[14:21] <Shadaez> nerd
[14:21] <Speljohan_> i tend to purchase albums from american record stores at ebay
[14:21] <Shadaez> lol; jk
[14:21] <Speljohan_> they usually have original press 80's albums

[14:24] * Maart3h (m-m-s@86.92.114.65) has joined #minecraft
[14:24] <eritz> and one utada hikaru album... i had hoped for more
[14:24] <Speljohan_> ugh asian music
[14:24] <Azathoth> i haven't bought a cd in years either
[14:24] <Speljohan_> i only like 2 asian bands
[14:24] <Azathoth> but that's because i don't even really listen to music
[14:24] <Speljohan_> japanese specifically
[14:25] <eritz> DAI and utada hikaru are both very distinct sounds
[14:25] <eritz> DAI's vocalist, van tomiko, is unmistakable
[14:26] <Speljohan_> i dun like j-pop tho
[14:26] <eritz> not sure i'd call DAI pop... and utada's often classified as R&B
[14:26] <Speljohan_> pretty much same thing to me
[14:27] <Speljohan_> in terms of enjoyability that is
[14:27] <Azathoth> oh lord
[14:27] <Azathoth> weeaboo talk
[14:27] <Azathoth> gotta run
[14:27] <Flesh> i have to agree with Azathoth
[14:27] <eritz> 'herp derp hes talking about something from japan HE MUST BE A WEEABOO'
[14:27] <Azathoth> yup
[14:27] <Flesh> also lol j-pop
[14:27] <Speljohan_> i tend to only listen to instrumental-focused technical music
[14:28] <eritz> i don't mind some electronic music, if it's catchy
[14:28] <Speljohan_> and fun-music
[14:28] <Speljohan_> like da jap bands i like
[14:28] <Speljohan_> !
[14:28] <eritz> i also gravitate towards vocalists
[14:28] <Speljohan_> i like distinct vocalists, usually ones that cannot be compared with anythin else in da world
[14:28] <Azathoth> i primarily listen to an offshoot of a capella composed entirely of female orgasm sounds
[14:28] <Speljohan_> awesome Azathoth
[14:29] <eritz> ever play kingdom hearts?
[14:29] <Azathoth> no, not really... i mainly listen to electronica
[14:30] <eritz> utada hikaru was the vocalist who sang the KH opening
[14:30] <Azathoth> ug
[14:30] <Azathoth> like i said, weeaboo :P
[14:30] <eritz> never mind that the song in question was entirely in english, eh?
[14:30] <Speljohan_> people like eric adams, warrel dane, mike howe, steve grimmett etc are my fav singers
[14:30] <Flesh> still weeaboo
[14:30] <Azathoth> it's kingdom hearts
[14:30] <Azathoth> nuff said
[14:31] <Flesh> Azathoth, i can tell right now that you have taste
[14:31] <eritz> >half the characters in KH are from american cartoons
[14:31] <Azathoth> why thank you :D
[14:31] <eritz> >weeaboo
[14:31] <eritz> >oh_u.jpg
[14:31] <Azathoth> that doesn't really mean anything
[14:31] <Flesh> where are the other half from?
[14:32] <eritz> actually, i'm pretty sure more than half of KH's characters are western in origin

[15:04] <Speljohan_> it just moves a binary number Demki
[15:04] <Speljohan_> lol
[15:04] <Demki> oh lolz
[15:04] <Demki> why would I need that?
[15:04] <Speljohan_> it shifts 0's
[15:04] <Speljohan_> etc
[15:04] <Speljohan_> it can be useful in many cases
[15:05] <Speljohan_> it's faster than traditional calculations
[15:05] <Demki> Like 5<<2 will give me 20?
[15:06] <Speljohan_> i duno, i dont think in binary numbers

[15:08] <Speljohan_> it adds the bits
[15:08] <Speljohan_> etc
[15:08] <Demki> | in java means bitwise OR

[15:08] <Speljohan_> rifk
[15:08] <Speljohan_> my mistake
[15:08] <Speljohan_> havent used bitshifting for a long time

[20:28] <bildramer> I'll fix
[20:29] <liq3> bildramer: what are you making?
[20:30] <bildramer> trying to do DF multiplayer
[20:30] <bildramer> well, ugh
[20:30] <bildramer> currently 2-"player"
[20:30] <bildramer> both can view the screen and press buttons
[20:30] <liq3> Yeh I doubt DF multi is possible over anything but lan but ok. :P
[20:30] <bildramer> that's it basically
[20:30] <bildramer> why not?
[20:30] <kwerty> Hamachi go go
[20:30] <bildramer> :l
[20:30] <bildramer> lol
[20:30] <liq3> just the huge amount of bandwidth required (or i'd assume so).
[20:31] <bildramer> uh, well
[20:31] <bildramer> 4000 bytes per frame
[20:31] <bildramer> 100 fps
[20:31] <liq3> DF's default speed is 100 FPS... nothing but lan could survive hat...
[20:31] <bildramer> lolyes
[20:31] <liq3> So we must assume 10fps for internets.
[20:31] <bildramer> 40KB/s wait what
[20:31] <bildramer> 400KB/s is too much
[20:31] <liq3> Which means it's basically sending full data of every living thing every frame.
[20:31] <liq3> :P
[20:31] <bildramer> but well, 25 or 20 fps would do
[20:31] <bildramer> no, just the display
[20:31] <bildramer> lol
[20:32] <liq3> well the display...
[20:32] <liq3> That's basically just DF livestream.
[20:32] <liq3> but ok.
[20:32] <bildramer> yes, but you can input
[20:32] <bildramer> and it's 100% clear and stuff

[20:33] <bildramer> lol
[20:33] <liq3> erm, more like just adding a "mp" part.
[20:33] <liq3> Still wouldn't be possible...
[20:34] <liq3> Then again i'm probably crazy.
[20:34] <bildramer> ...
[20:34] <bildramer> it's just text
[20:34] <liq3> Actually now that I think about it, dwarf positions (x,y,z) is only 3 bytes.
[20:34] <bildramer> 256 possible characters, 256 possible colors
[20:35] <liq3> Items only need to be updated when changed...
[20:35] <bildramer> anything more would not really be feasible
[20:35] <bildramer> you're talking about adventurer mode right
[20:35] <liq3> I'm thinking MP dwarfness. :P
[20:35] <Firetempest> just mp adventure would be hilarious
[20:35] <liq3> 100 dwarves alone would take 4KBps up JUST for position...
[20:36] <bildramer> meh
[20:36] <bildramer> you should all ask ToadyOne
[20:36] <liq3> Wounds and hunger and everything adds more.
[20:36] <bildramer> I'm just making multiple people able to control dorfs
[20:36] <liq3> Every creature on the map needs to update position whenever it changes...
[20:36] <liq3> bildramer: i know. :D
[20:36] <liq3> I'm just pondering MP dwarf bandwidth requirements.
[20:37] <bildramer> short answer: too much
[20:37] <bildramer> long answer: too fucking much
[20:37] <liq3> I think the real issue would be water. :D
[20:38] <liq3> Need X,y,z and depth.
[20:38] <liq3> i mean you need to even say it's got water...

[21:39] <sllide> cool
[21:39] <Quatroking> just check the download link
[21:39] <blaster> Ok... would it be a good idea to split the wiki into namespaces?
[21:39] <Quatroking> oh
[21:39] <Quatroking> uh
[21:39] <blaster> For survival and creative
[21:39] <Quatroking> no

[21:39] <sllide> becouse i like suck at it and then i can learn it lol
[21:40] <blaster> Quatroking why not?
[21:40] <Quatroking> it'd make my moderating job harder

[21:40] <vurtual> A netsplit is where an agent changes something in IRC.
[21:41] <Quatroking> I'd have to check pages if its creative or survival

[21:42] <bildramer> infdev?
[21:42] <Quatroking> yes
[21:42] <blaster> Quatroking for the wiki to be able to expand we will need to switch to namespaces for creative/survival at some point
[21:42] <bildramer> so there IS gravel
[21:42] <bildramer> :D :D :D :D :D
[21:42] <TerraSleet> hacks!
[21:42] <bildramer> I'll play infdev

[21:43] <TerraSleet> to be honest Minecraft doesn't need a wiki unless said wiki is holding utilities, community stuff and a crafting list
[21:43] <Quatroking> Yes, there is also sand
[21:43] <Quatroking> I found two beaches of those
[21:43] <Quatroking> terrasleet: said wiki holds that
[21:43] <Quatroking> faggot
[21:44] <liq3> TerraSleet: ... Lol.
[21:44] * Quatroking is digging DELICIOUS GRAVEL
[21:44] <TerraSleet> My point was it doesn't need anything else other than that, Minecraft is a simple game
[21:44] <TerraSleet> if it had a shitton of features it would need a wiki, yes
[21:44] <ZomBuster> he took me like 2 weeks to find gravel on my save
[21:44] <blaster> Terrasleet better than newbies coming on here and asking the most basic questions
[21:44] <liq3> TerraSleet: Oh? Nevermind I missread "Minecraft" As "Dwarf Fortress"
[21:44] <TerraSleet> stickies on forums.
[21:44] <Quatroking> terrasleet, have you noticed the amount of complete retards playing minecraft
[21:44] <liq3> Yeh I don't get the wiki much either.
[21:45] <liq3> Quatroking: wiki won't fix that.
[21:45] <TerraSleet> no need to be so hostile
[21:45] <blaster> Most of us know everything about minecraft, new players might not
[21:45] <Quatroking> liq3 hell if I care
[21:45] <TerraSleet> calm down >.>
[21:45] <liq3> Ok so Quatroking is trolling. Got it.
[21:46] <Quatroking> what?
[21:46] <Quatroking> Jesus, learn how trolling goes
[21:46] <blaster> Quatroking can you set up a proper community portal on the wiki?
[21:46] <TerraSleet> he's not trolling liq3
[21:46] <Quatroking> blaster I'm too lazy for that
[21:46] <liq3> Ok so he's retarded. Close enough.
[21:46] <TerraSleet> he's being honest in a hostile tone
[21:46] <blaster> Want me to?
[21:46] <Quatroking> sure
[21:46] <TerraSleet> which is close to trolling
[21:46] <liq3> TerraSleet: He makes a statement refering to the wiki, then contradicts himself in his next sentence. i.e. retard.
[21:46] <blaster> Is it ok to lay it out in 3 sections, discussion, areas to contribute and wiki projects
[21:47] <liq3> or troll.
[21:47] <TerraSleet> lol trolls

[21:49] <TerraSleet> all this game needs for information is a few stickies on the minecraft forums

[21:49] <Quatroking> But it helps once in a while, and saves us IRC people time with explaining things to newbs
[21:49] <Jake|> something wrong with explaining new things to newbies?
[21:49] <TerraSleet> just go to the DF IRC
[21:50] <Quatroking> so how do I go about making one of these fire things with flint
[21:50] <TerraSleet> all it is is newbies asking questions or 'OMG I KILD A GOBLIN'
[21:50] <liq3> TerraSleet: which is?
[21:50] <liq3> rofl.
[21:50] <TerraSleet> and on the rare occasion

[21:50] <blaster> Quatroking does the wiki have a forum feature?

[21:59] <blaster> It causes random characters to appear everywhere inside the table

[22:13] <Snowman> How is it "new"
[22:13] <blaster> It depends how far back you consider the creation of minecraft
[22:14] <Quatroking> sounds familliar
[22:14] <blaster> If you consider that attempted DF clone to be minecraft, then its way back
[22:14] <Snowman> I heard it when I was in Austria/Germany in February, but it was made way earlier
[22:14] <Snowman> And now they're saying it's "new" :/
[22:15] <Quatroking> who made it

[22:25] <Quatroking> besides I have dual firewalls
[22:26] <Snowman> You remove your hostname?
[22:26] <blaster> Readers may tire of reading a page much longer than about 30 to 50 KB, which roughly corresponds to 6,000 to 10,000 words of readable prose. If an article is significantly longer than that, it may benefit the reader to move some sections to other articles and replace them with summaries (see Wikipedia:Summary style)
[22:26] <Quatroking> nah for some reason I never had one here
[22:26] <Snowman> Oh
[22:26] <blaster> And the blocks page is 32kb AND is unfinished
[22:26] <blaster> Thats not good
[22:26] <sllide> :o
[22:26] <sllide> but it looks fucked up
[22:26] <Snowman> I thought you were some "1337 h4x0r" who changed his hostname
[22:26] <sllide> oh wait it doesnt
[22:26] <Quatroking> the block pages were fine until SOMEONE needed to fuck it all up and throw it on one page
[22:26] * sllide had do resize the window lol
[22:27] <bildramer> lol
[22:27] <Snowman> Would be funny if you changed your hostname to someone else's ip :D
[22:27] <Quatroking> lol
[22:27] <blaster> Quatroking will that be fixed at a future date?
[22:27] <sllide> bildgamer is it a wrapper or hardcoded?
[22:27] <bildramer> uh, some other guy did it
[22:27] <bildramer> wrapper
[22:27] <Quatroking> blaster: if someone cares to fix it, probably
[22:27] <sllide> ah
[22:27] <blaster> As more blocks are added to the game the situation will get worse

[23:32] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[23:32] <Ten_Tacles> I don't understand
[23:32] <Ten_Tacles> Explain.
[23:33] <kwerty> You seriously have never used telnet?
[23:34] <Ten_Tacles> Yes

[23:38] <PuyoDead> God I hate telnet.
[23:38] <bildramer> Why?
[23:38] <Ten_Tacles> The heck is telnet
[23:38] <bildramer> ...
[23:38] <wry> ha
[23:39] <bildramer> you know when some black boxes with white letters appear?
[23:39] <PuyoDead> Telnet is older than you, Ten.
[23:39] <bildramer> :l
[23:39] <bildramer> I grew up with DOS
[23:39] <bildramer> yay me
[23:39] <wry> i grew up with amigaos
[23:39] <bildramer> ...
[23:39] <bildramer> beat me
[23:39] <bildramer> :(
[23:39] <PuyoDead> I've done my share of BBS time, but I never got along with telnet.
[23:40] <wry> it's only because it's what we had at the time, we weren't rich enough for newer ibm compatibles with their fancy dos
[23:40] <PuyoDead> On an awesome 2400 baud modem, too.

[23:40] <Ten_Tacles> Puyo, HOW old?
[23:40] <Yourself> who's this troll on notch's blog?
[23:40] <Yourself> 'george'
[23:40] <Ten_Tacles> A useless, lifeless troll?
[23:40] <PuyoDead> *shrug* Nobody cares, really.
[23:40] <Ten_Tacles> ....
[23:41] <Yourself> he's not a very good troll
[23:41] <Ten_Tacles> Uh
[23:41] <Yourself> he's too obvious
[23:41] <Ten_Tacles> So can anybody tell what Telnet is?
[23:41] <Yourself> a good troll is much more subtle
[23:41] <kwerty> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet
[23:41] <PuyoDead> Didn't you read the wiki?
[23:41] <Ten_Tacles> No
[23:41] <kwerty> Just another network protocol
[23:41] <Yourself> it's just funny, because he just went and replied to like the last 5 posts telling people to fuck off and asking notch if he plays MW2
[23:42] <PuyoDead> Notch even said he doesn't care who he is. He just ignored him.
[23:42] <PuyoDead> Probably lailai.
[23:42] <Animator> And apparently a couple of a people like his comments.
[23:42] <Yourself> i bet it's just him uprating his own comments
[23:42] <Ten_Tacles> Lol

[23:43] <Demki> like what?
[23:43] <Yourself> but then it wouldn't surprised me if there was some kind of 4chan shit going on
[23:43] <Yourself> whatever
[23:43] <Yourself> i wouldn't*
[23:43] <Demki> ...
[23:43] <Demki> you forgot the "be"
[23:44] <bildramer> Ten_Tacles, it's called an asshole
[23:44] <Ten_Tacles> ORLY?
[23:44] <PuyoDead> Poop comes out of it.
[23:44] <bildramer> the world is currently populated by a majority of them
[23:44] <Ten_Tacles> I call those damn forgotten beasts assholes.
[23:44] <Ten_Tacles> They always screw my forts <.<
[23:44] <Ten_Tacles> Even if they die.
[23:44] <Yourself> bah, Ten_Tacles is caught in my mibbit wide ignore
[23:44] <bildramer> omg migrants
[23:44] <Ten_Tacles> Yourself why?
[23:44] <Yourself> there, all better
[23:44] <bildramer> *cannon fodder
[23:45] <Ten_Tacles> I am not using mibbit notmally
[23:45] <Yourself> because i added all mibbit users to my ignore list
[23:45] <Ten_Tacles> Bildramer they came too late.
[23:45] <Ten_Tacles> <.<
[23:45] <Ten_Tacles> Yourself
[23:45] <bildramer> my fortress position is fucking epic
[23:45] <Ten_Tacles> You suck
[23:45] <Ten_Tacles> You know nothing

[23:45] <Yourself> hey, it goes by user mask
[23:45] <bildramer> ...wat
[23:45] <Ten_Tacles> <.<
[23:45] <Ten_Tacles> Whatever
[23:45] <bildramer> that miner fell asleep while drinking
[23:45] <Yourself> but you've got an exception now
[23:45] <bildramer> DF is approaching reality
[23:46] <Animator> I'm very tempted to ban the entirety of mibbit, as I've previously said. A vast majority of most trolls come through there on this channel.
[23:46] <Ten_Tacles> I have lost 2 forts to forgotten beasts, 1 to goblins and ~200 to boringness
[23:46] <bildramer> 4 migrants
[23:46] <Animator> But alas, the client on the forum runs on Mibbit.

[23:46] <Ten_Tacles> Not
[23:46] <bildramer> really, put a notice somewhere
[23:46] <kwerty> What is mibbit anyway?
[23:46] <Ten_Tacles> I am not using mibbit because I want to
[23:46] <bildramer> -GET A REAL CLIENT-
[23:46] <Ten_Tacles> I HAVE to.
[23:46] <Ten_Tacles> HAVE
[23:46] <Animator> Mibbit is a web client.
[23:46] <PuyoDead> If not for the site client, mibbit would have been banned months ago.
[23:46] <bildramer> I can even use PuTTY and it's better
[23:47] <Yourself> <Animator> I'm very tempted to ban the entirety of mibbit, as I've previously said. A vast majority of most trolls come through there on this channel.
[23:47] <Animator> Puyo speaks the truth.
[23:47] <Ten_Tacles> :(
[23:47] <bildramer> PONG 0947763299
[23:47] <Yourself> which is why they got the ignore
[23:47] <bildramer> :l
[23:47] <blaster> I need to get together about ?1,000 for a new PC
[23:47] <Ten_Tacles> Don't ignore me, I am not a trolling
[23:47] <Ten_Tacles> ...
[23:47] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[23:47] <Yourself> i'm not, you got on my exception list
[23:47] <blaster> I have ?410 already, but I need ideas on what to sell
[23:47] <PuyoDead> Mibbit has been the source of entirely too many idiots/ban evaders/attacks/etc.
[23:47] <kwerty> Get a job?
[23:47] <Yourself> and as long as you don't annoy me too much, you'll stay there
[23:48] <blaster> Kwerty, as a 13 year old the only jobs I can get pay so low
[23:48] <blaster> That its quicker to find money under vending machines
[23:48] <Animator> Unless you become an indie developer and make games, blaster. And open up some kind of online account.
[23:48] <Yourself> speaking of money, i got my tax money back today
[23:48] <Yourself> $506
[23:49] <Yourself> some kind of student credit or something
[23:49] <Yourself> i can't remember
[23:49] <Ten_Tacles> I have never evaded bans :D
[23:49] <blaster> Animater, I was planning to sell some of my old shit
[23:49] <blaster> Any suggestions?
[23:49] <kwerty> How about listing your old shit?
[23:49] <Animator> Hm. What kind of old shit do you have?
[23:49] <blaster> Games/Books/DVD's
[23:49] <Ten_Tacles> Old shit is old
[23:49] <bildramer> haha
[23:49] <Yourself> i'm not sure there's much of a market for old human feces
[23:49] <blaster> And some very old forign currency
[23:49] <blaster> LOL
[23:49] <blaster> If you can sell that sort of stuff...
[23:49] <blaster> Because most of it is no longer in use
[23:50] <Animator> Depends on the quality, rarity, and need for the product.
[23:50] <Animator> eBay is the way to go.
[23:50] <blaster> Thats what I am doing
[23:50] <Animator> But be more specific.
[23:50] <Yourself> give blowjobs at $10 a p...oh, 13
[23:50] <blaster> The only thing I would be able to sell is the anime DVDs
[23:50] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[23:50] <Animator> What games, DVDs, and books do you have?
[23:50] <blaster> Because apparently the USA loves them
[23:50] <Ten_Tacles> http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/DF2010:Olm
[23:51] <Ten_Tacles> I may start testing if vermin breed.
[23:51] <bildramer> lol
[23:51] <blaster> Mostly non-ficton science and history, PS1 PS2 Xbox360 Gamecube PSP DS GamboyAdvance
[23:51] <bildramer> monarch butterflies
[23:51] <Ten_Tacles> There is NO proof anywhere if they breed.
[23:51] <Ten_Tacles> Maybe
[23:51] <Ten_Tacles> But then underground
[23:51] <blaster> DVD's are a mix of childrens, standard and comedy
[23:51] <Ten_Tacles> Where they do not spawn
[23:52] <Animator> Hmmm. PS1 games may go for some money, since they're not being made anymore.
[23:52] <Yourself> seinfeld DVDs?
[23:52] <Ten_Tacles> http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/DF2010_Talk:Vermin
[23:52] <Animator> Do you keep any old consoles?
[23:52] <Ten_Tacles> Huha
[23:52] <Ten_Tacles> There is my idea
[23:52] <blaster> Animator how about GTA2
[23:52] <blaster> And I have sold most of them old
[23:52] <blaster> Such as the PS1
[23:52] <Ten_Tacles> I don't have problems with not enough money
[23:52] <Animator> Hm.
[23:52] <Animator> You'd have to compare with other prices out there.
[23:53] <blaster> In soviet UK, Money does not have enough of you

[23:53] <blaster> Seriously
[23:53] <blaster> In the UK you ALWAYS need more money
[23:53] <kwerty> Money is evul
[23:53] <Ten_Tacles> EVIL
[23:53] <Ten_Tacles> EVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLL
[23:53] <Yourself> that's annoying
[23:54] <Animator> Well, the most you would expect from GTA2 would be.... One dollar.
[23:54] <blaster> Yay...
[23:54] <Animator> Unless you kept the thing in a ridiculously mint condition.
[23:54] <blaster> Just what I expected
[23:54] <Yourself> especially since Steam just had a sale for the entire GTA series sans IV for $7.50
[23:54] <blaster> Its in terrible condition, but the disk works fine
[23:54] <blaster> Case bad manual gone
[23:55] <Animator> .50 cents then.
[23:55] <blaster> How about 3 bins full of lego?
[23:55] <Animator> Unless you keep the true value hidden and sell it in real life.
[23:55] <Animator> Then you could go for $5, $10 if you're one hell of a hustler.
[23:56] <Ten_Tacles> I never manage to really play a fortress.
[23:56] <PuyoDead> I've got some games worth $150+, there's quite a few rare gems out there worth good money.
[23:56] <Ten_Tacles> I either stop playing it before the second year, or die in the second year.
[23:56] <Animator> You could also melt all the pennies you have available to you and then sell it to someone.
[23:57] <Animator> A penny melted down to it's original metal it worth 2 cents.
[23:57] <Yourself> pennies over here are only copper plated
[23:57] <Animator> That means if you have 1,000 pennies stashed, you can duplicate that to $20.00.
[23:57] <blaster> ANIMATOR
[23:57] <blaster> I dont live in the USA so its different
[23:57] <Yourself> solid copper pennies are actually worth more for the copper than the penny itself

[23:58] <blaster> Good luck owning a furnace powerful enough to melt em down

[23:58] <Yourself> PuyoDead, they're still in circulation
[23:58] <blaster> Good luck evading the law because destroying currecny like that is against the law
[23:58] <bildramer> ow snap plz
[23:58] <Yourself> that too
[23:58] <PuyoDead> Not many. At least, not enough to make it worth it.
[23:59] <Yourself> yes, that's also true
[23:59] <PuyoDead> I've got a pretty good amount of solid silver coins.
[23:59] <Yourself> they stopped minting solid copper pennies in 1982
[23:59] * blaster gets some scales
[23:59] <Animator> Again, you could also take up programming and make games as an indie dev.
[23:59] <Ten_Tacles> Lols
[23:59] <Yourself> that'd probably be easier
[23:59] <Animator> With the right ideas and good price, you'll get some quick bucks while being bad-ass in the process.
