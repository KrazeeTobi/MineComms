[1:47] <bildramer> ^
[1:47] <Kokopure> do you think
[1:47] <bildramer> arrrrrrrrrr
[1:47] <Maksie99> even though that is sort of unlikely
[1:47] <Keiya> Why are people still being all "I want indev updates, not infdev!"?
[1:47] <Kokopure> that if I dug a chasm to the center of the earth
[1:47] <Kokopure> then dug up
[1:47] <JasonTroll> Arrgggh, Pirate Asuka!

[1:48] <JasonTroll> no
[1:48] <Maksie99> september something i think
[1:48] <Kokopure> Maksie99, who are you talking to
[1:48] <Maksie99> EVERYONE
[1:48] <Keiya> It makes just as little sense to modify indev right now as it does prealpha
[1:48] <JasonTroll> the cat
[1:48] <bildramer> THE PEOPLE
[1:48] <Kokopure> because whoever thinks you're wrong deserves a face full of rage pie
[1:48] <Dragoon> Desperate Desperate Desperate
[1:48] <bildramer> and the motherland
[1:48] <Keiya> I want online saves back though >_>
[1:48] <JasonTroll> have a nice cup of rage

[1:48] <Azathoth> savage
[1:48] <Keiya> Online saves would have to be limited to 'small' maps, of course, but
[1:48] <bildramer> fail
[1:48] <Maksie99> NINJA'D BIATCH
[1:48] <Azathoth> fffuuuu
[1:48] <Dragoon> Electronic Old Men
[1:49] <Dragoon> And their flexibility
[1:49] <Kokopure> anyone else think fruit trees would be a good idea?
[1:49] <Azathoth> lol
[1:49] <Maksie99> YES, PALM TREES
[1:49] <Maksie99> with bananas and shit
[1:49] <SireTRM> This is another way to play "The Game"
[1:49] <Maksie99> and monkeys
[1:49] <Maksie99> looks like i just lost the game
[1:49] <SireTRM> Ayup.
[1:50] <Dragoon> Paul...I...I...Ithoughtyouwereagepgun
[1:50] <Psywing> The game is a childish internet fad
[1:51] <Maksie99> but seriously minecraft needs bananas and monkeys
[1:51] <Maksie99> and also giant rideable armadillos
[1:51] <Maksie99> i demand all of these to be added
[1:51] <Varriount> I second that demand
[1:51] <bildramer> oh dude I ate the sun yesterday
[1:51] <bildramer> I'm so full
[1:52] <bildramer> ffff game
[1:52] <Varriount> bildramer: Spit

[1:52] <Varriount> You don't know where it's been!
[1:52] <bildramer> lol
[1:52] <Maksie99> It might have been near uranus

[1:52] * PyroPyro (PyroPyro@77.46.207.104) has joined #minecraft
[1:52] <bildramer> duh

[1:53] * Varriount dies
[1:53] <Dragoon> I SPEEL MY DREENK
[1:53] <Maksie99> YOU HAVE TO

[1:53] <bildramer> >flint
[1:53] <Maksie99> is anyone else having trouble finding steel in the new maps"?
[1:53] * bildramer looks for some sense?
[1:54] <bildramer> yeah
[1:54] <Psywing> I've found a few good veins
[1:54] <bildramer> everyone
[1:54] <Maksie99> i've looked all around the island and i have only found 2 ores
[1:54] <bildramer> because it's not steel, it's iron
[1:54] <bildramer> lol
[1:54] <Kokopure> I think palm trees would be beautiful!
[1:54] <Kokopure> only growable on sand :3
[1:54] <Azathoth> i'm having trouble finding danielle steel in the new maps
[1:54] <Maksie99> iron = steel for some reason
[1:54] <bildramer> I would beautiful trees be think palm!
[1:54] <Kokopure> but palm trees don't grow bananas.
[1:54] <Keiya> Maksie99: It only shows up below the surface
[1:54] <Maksie99> i know
[1:54] <Kokopure> palm trees grow coconuts.
[1:54] * PyroPyro (PyroPyro@77.46.207.104) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[1:54] <Maksie99> but even after digging
[1:54] <Keiya> Bananas don't grow on trees
[1:54] <bildramer> Keiya, wrong
[1:54] <Keiya> Or well
[1:54] <bildramer> it's only in the lower 60% map
[1:55] <Keiya> It /mostly/ shows up beneith the surface
[1:55] <Kokopure> there was a fight about this in The Last Uniform.
[1:55] <Maksie99> and pigs dont disappear in a puff of smoke when they die
[1:55] <Kokopure> they do too!
[1:55] <Psywing> Bananas DO grow on trees
[1:55] <Kokopure> I seen 'em!
[1:55] <Dragoon> That's like saying coconuts grow from the ground
[1:55] <bildramer> lol
[1:55] <Kokopure> coconuts are not a tuber.
[1:55] <Maksie99> i dont like coconuts
[1:55] <Dragoon> Exactly
[1:55] <Keiya> Psywing: They grow from, um
[1:55] <bildramer> we are all stardust
[1:55] <Keiya> things that are kinda like trees
[1:55] <Keiya> but technically arent
[1:55] * DimJim (chatzilla@cpe-24-242-36-94.hot.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: no)

[1:55] <Dragoon> Derp
[1:55] <Maksie99> have any of you ever drank coconut water?
[1:55] <bildramer> you won?
[1:55] <Kokopure> I have!
[1:55] <Psywing> Yes
[1:55] <bildramer> the game, I suppose
[1:55] <Kokopure> it's good from a coconut.
[1:56] <Maksie99> it's disgusting
[1:56] <Kokopure> not so much from a can.
[1:56] <Psywing> >_>
[1:56] <bildramer> I have alittle
[1:56] <bildramer> a l
[1:56] <bildramer> **
[1:56] <bildramer> and I have tried to open a coconut
[1:56] <bildramer> with a hammer
[1:56] <Maksie99> i had to hammer the damn thing open and then the stuff inside was slimey and bitter
[1:56] <bildramer> failed spectacularly
[1:56] <LuciferZ> I lost my microphone D:
[1:56] <LuciferZ> And ironically, my voice status D:
[1:56] <bildramer> I lost my microphone drivers D:
[1:56] <Keiya> Maksie99: Straight from a coconut, it's excelent for mixing up drinks :P
[1:56] <bildramer> that's not irony
[1:56] <Maksie99> I lost the game D:
[1:56] <Kokopure> mhm!
[1:56] <bildramer> irony would be getting voice
[1:57] <Iguana> LuciferZ, you doing a livestream toniigghhttt?
[1:57] <Dragoon> Fuck the game
[1:57] <Maksie99> indeed, i hate it
[1:57] <bildramer> teh gaem

[1:57] <bildramer> I'll lose it tomorrow over 3 times during English class
[1:57] <Kokopure> Maskie99, maybe you got a bad one.
[1:57] <Keiya> Anyway
[1:57] <bildramer> our book is about a game
[1:57] <bildramer> so yeah
[1:57] <Maksie99> possibly
[1:57] <Keiya> the reason flint and water are related is because gravel mostly shows near water
[1:57] <Iguana> bildramer, get owned
[1:57] <bildramer> good night
[1:57] <bildramer> Keiya, no shit
[1:57] <Keiya> And I don't like leaving 'holes' next to water
[1:57] <Keiya> it looks... dumb
[1:57] <Iguana> LuciferZ, if you have good music on, I don't care
[1:57] <bildramer> just fill them back
[1:58] <bildramer> lol Iguana
[1:58] * bildramer has been the jukebox
[1:58] <Maksie99> minecraft needs buckets.
[1:58] <bildramer> yeah
[1:58] <Iguana> WHY YOU LOLLIN' AT ME, PUNK
[1:58] <Maksie99> when we have dynamic water i wanna be able to carry water uphill

[1:58] <Maksie99> walruses will drop them
[1:58] <Psywing> Ok
[1:59] <Iguana> Carry a glass of water then trip?
[1:59] <Maksie99> also, i dont know if he has
[1:59] <Keiya> Also I want um
[1:59] <Iguana> And flood the universe?
[1:59] <Keiya> the ability to set my spawn
[1:59] <Psywing> That would be nice
[1:59] <Keiya> because damnit, when you build shit far from spawn, then die... >_>
[1:59] * setveen (setveen@d24-57-103-82.home.cgocable.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[1:59] <Maksie99> i want the map generator to generate more awesome crap like ruins
[1:59] <LuciferZ> Iguana I'll probably have my Metallica/Hard Rock playlist going.
[1:59] <Psywing> OR, you could just build AROUND your starting point (hurr)
[1:59] <Maksie99> and possibly portals to other parts of the map

[2:00] <Maksie99> i mean how awesome would it be to be travelling around minecraft to find the remains of a huge stone tower that is infested with skeletons?
[2:00] <Psywing> Ruins and caves would be awesome
[2:01] <Maksie99> also, giant forests would be cool
[2:01] <Maksie99> with huge trees
[2:01] <Psywing> Even have them with chests insides
[2:01] <Dragoon> There's not knowing how to craft in Minecraft, then there's this: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=14357

[2:02] <Keiya> Psywing: Then what's the point of infinite maps if you can't wander off and build where you want?
[2:02] <Psywing> I was kidding :c
[2:02] * gear1 (Administra@c-76-110-75-142.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)
[2:02] <Maksie99> but what's the point of danger when death means nothing?
[2:02] <Maksie99> it's all about survival

[2:03] <Kokopure> I only go on peaceful mode when I'm exploring/mapping.
[2:03] <Kokopure> zomg
[2:03] <Keiya> Maksie99: I normally play on peaceful....
[2:03] <Kokopure> I have a picture
[2:03] <Maksie99> tell them to jump
[2:03] <Kokopure> oh wait I don't
[2:03] <Maksie99> you'll get bacon
[2:03] <Kokopure> :<
[2:03] <Crix> lol
[2:03] <Crix> one of them did
[2:03] <Kokopure> I thought I did.
[2:03] <Crix> and bacon flew out
[2:03] <Crix> it was epic
[2:03] <Crix> :D

[2:04] <Crix> :D
[2:04] <Keiya> Also screwing up cliffdiving hurts >_>
[2:04] * Keiya shrugs...
[2:04] <Maksie99> yup.
[2:04] <Keiya> really, infinite maps are an investment against when we have multiplayer, I guess
[2:04] <Kokopure> haha
[2:04] <Maksie99> i found out recently that shallow water will kill your ass
[2:04] <Kokopure> I cliffdived into a lake.
[2:04] <Kokopure> ended up falling short.
[2:04] <Kokopure> needless to say I didn't make it.
[2:05] <Dragoon> lol
[2:05] <rob`> has to be two deep :/
[2:05] <rob`> kersplat
[2:05] <Maksie99> yup
[2:05] <Kokopure> oh realy?
[2:05] <Dragoon> yep
[2:05] <Maksie99> lost a whole bunch of crap that day
[2:05] <Kokopure> really*
[2:05] <Keiya> yeah
[2:05] <Kokopure> ah crap
[2:05] <Kokopure> sorry for your loss
[2:05] <Keiya> This isn't as bad as Source-based games
[2:05] <Keiya> You can fall into two inch water /from orbit/ and not take damage in HL2
[2:05] <Maksie99> don't be hatin' on source
[2:06] <Dragoon> My god, whenever I make an infdev map I spawn on a beach.
[2:06] <Maksie99> team fortress 2 is still one of my favorite games
[2:06] <Maksie99> yup
[2:06] <Maksie99> always
[2:06] <Snowman> I fucking hate Microsoft
[2:06] <Keiya> Source works.
[2:06] * LG_Legacy (Slizard@66-227-202-118.dhcp.bycy.mi.charter.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[2:06] <Keiya> I prefer modding UT, personally
[2:06] <Snowman> And their stupid XPS shit
[2:06] <Keiya> And mapping for UT.
[2:06] <gordenfreechmen> Dragoon: i think thats intentional
[2:06] <Keiya> >_>
[2:07] <Keiya> Snowman: "Let's create a standard for representing pages! Then write drivers that translate it to postscript!"
[2:07] <Dragoon> IDEA
[2:07] <Snowman> It's funny cause I saved a page to print it later
[2:07] <Dragoon> Deus Ex Texture Pack
[2:07] <Snowman> And now it can't even print at all
[2:07] <Keiya> ...erm
[2:07] <Keiya> I've been able to print xps stuff?
[2:07] <Maksie99> Can we change the minecraft sounds?
[2:07] <Snowman> The XPS viewer just refuses to print
[2:08] <Maksie99> because if that pack is made, the creeper's "ssssssss" needs to become "JC, a bomb!!"
[2:08] * Kingzan (Strawberry@bas9-ottawa23-1128751090.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Quit: Seeya)
[2:08] <Snowman> SIlly helicopters
[2:08] <Calhoun> Why even change it to the XPS format for later printing? Just keep it in whatever format it was originally in, and then print that form the relevant application. Seems Needlessly complex.
[2:08] <Keiya> Minecraft needs watermelons.
[2:08] <Maksie99> and also giants
[2:08] <Keiya> And they need to grow in proximity to bays
[2:09] <Maksie99> giants would sleep un huge caves, and if you woke them up they would go apeshit and destroy everything
[2:09] <Dragoon> Or just JC saying "A BOMB"
[2:09] <Keiya> GOZIEYA!
[2:09] <Snowman> Calhoun, it was a webpage

[2:09] <Snowman> I don't like webpages and stuff all floating around my computer
[2:09] <Maksie99> perhaps a giant creeper!
[2:09] <Nyutan> Beep.
[2:09] <Keiya> No seriously, Godzilla in minecraft
[2:09] <Maksie99> if provoked enough, he'd cause a nuclear explosion
[2:09] <Keiya> Why not print to pdf? :P
[2:10] <Dragoon> Just imagine, you're mining in your cave and suddenly you hear "A BOMB. A BOMB. A BOMB."
[2:10] <Maksie99> and destroy the entire infdev map
[2:10] <Snowman> But anyway, Microsoft likes to be total dickwads and make software that doesn't work
[2:10] <Nyutan> Notch should be showing minecraft at E3.
[2:10] <Nyutan> :D
[2:10] <Maksie99> yesz.
[2:10] <Snowman> They tried to copy PDF but failed
[2:10] <Jat> they make software that works it just works badly
[2:10] <Keiya> Nyutan: Unlikely.
[2:10] <Snowman> Miserably
[2:10] <Keiya> E3 is all 'you have to already be established to get in at all'

[2:10] <Jat> when did ms try to copy pdf?
[2:10] <Maksie99> i think minecraft also needs some more depth in combat, maybe shields or something
[2:10] * Vis{CSS} is now known as Visiiri
[2:11] <Keiya> Jat: XPS
[2:11] <Nyutan> Notch can use psychic paper to get in.
[2:11] <Snowman> Just buy a normal ticket, take a deployable booth, and win!
[2:11] <Jat> i have not heard of xps before
[2:11] <Keiya> Snowman: There aren't normal tickets anymore
[2:11] <Keiya> They got rid of them a few years back. Now you MUST be either dev, or press to get in
[2:11] * Cial (Mibbit@209-42-190-145.wispnet.net) has joined #minecraft
[2:11] <Snowman> Seriously?
[2:11] <vurtual> after looking at a steampunk millenium falcon, I want to make something lego steampunk
[2:11] <Keiya> Yeah.
[2:11] <Snowman> That just plain sucks balls
[2:12] <vurtual> but I lack the pieces for anything considerable
[2:12] <vurtual> TO THE BATMOBILE!
[2:12] <Keiya> Also, deployable booths at any convention will get you kicked out
[2:12] <Snowman> But if you're a dev, you don't need to display a game right?
[2:12] <Snowman> So you can just be a dev that goes there without having a booth
[2:12] * Keiya doesn't know
[2:12] <Maksie99> oh, bees in minecraft would be cool
[2:12] <Cial> lego and steampunk....you need Indiana Jones sets vurtual
[2:12] <Snowman> Cause I would just create my own company then :D
[2:13] <Snowman> Make a 5 minute "game" in GM
[2:13] <Snowman> Bam
[2:13] <Keiya> Anyway, Minecraft isn't an FPS, and it;s not by Nintendo
[2:13] <Snowman> Evil Snowman Corporation
[2:13] <Snowman> The new EA
[2:13] <Keiya> No chance of getting in anyway.
[2:13] <Keiya> And if he did
[2:13] <Keiya> no chance of getting attention
[2:13] <Snowman> Let's all raid the E3
[2:13] <Maksie99> maybe he could stand outside

[2:52] <vurtual> and threatened with their life?
[2:52] <vurtual> No?

[2:52] <ZaxKellens> The good and the bad
[2:52] <Miclee> EA has failed.
[2:52] <vurtual> tornadoes are not fun
[2:52] <vurtual> they are not friendly
[2:52] <ZaxKellens> I know they aren't
[2:52] <vurtual> the moment you see one, it is annihilating you
[2:52] <ZaxKellens> But they're amazing
[2:53] <Dude000> >ea has failed
[2:53] <ZaxKellens> Not exactly
[2:53] <vurtual> they are something that shuold not exist
[2:53] <vurtual> they are not amazing
[2:53] <Dude000> >not pointing out the lack of valve
[2:53] <vurtual> they are just horrible
[2:53] <Dude000> get out
[2:53] <vurtual> and yes, yes they are.
[2:53] <Miclee> Valve publishes themselves mostly, now, Dude000.
[2:53] <tfaal> vurtual: Should not exist? How so?
[2:53] <Azathoth> miclee, they announced they aren't getting made?
[2:53] <ZaxKellens> You really hate tornados, duncha?
[2:53] <vurtual> Because they destroy so much
[2:53] <Miclee> No, they didn't even tease about them.
[2:53] <Azathoth> or they just didn't have anything to show for them at all?
[2:53] <vurtual> and traumatized me
[2:53] <Dude000> but they announce under ea
[2:53] <Miclee> Not even a mention.
[2:53] <Azathoth> oh god

[2:56] <Dude000> that's totally pointing out why mass effect is different from any other shooting game
[2:57] <Dude000> yeah that too
[2:57] <ZaxKellens> I love the water
[2:57] <ZaxKellens> It makes me wanna touch myself
[2:57] <Azathoth> mass effect isn't even a shooting game?
[2:57] <Azathoth> it's an RPG
[2:57] <zaneo> with guns
[2:57] <Azathoth> it's still an RPG
[2:57] <ZaxKellens> It's a shooting game too
[2:57] <Dude000> fps would be a lie because it's not first person last time i checked
[2:57] <zaneo> where you shoot stuff lol
[2:57] <Dude000> but yeah everything revolves around guns
[2:57] <Dude000> and shooting things
[2:57] <Azathoth> did i say FPS?
[2:57] <Dude000> stats are just tacked on
[2:57] <zaneo> shooting game is different then fps
[2:58] <ZaxKellens> It's a TPS
[2:58] <zaneo> fallout 3 was a "shooting game" and rpg
[2:58] <ZaxKellens> Third Person Shooter
[2:58] <Dude000> it's like if i made mario jump on things and gain levels
[2:58] <Dude000> oh wait!
[2:58] <Azathoth> you're clearly not the kind of dude who cares about things like story or character development
[2:58] <ZaxKellens> Super Mario RPG

[2:59] <Azathoth> it's not that he doesn't like mass effect that bothers me
[2:59] <Ominus> lol
[2:59] <Azathoth> it's that he's so shallow about it
[2:59] <Dude000> probably
[2:59] <ZaxKellens> Mass Effect is just a Star Trek rip~

[3:05] <Dude000> not rip
[3:06] <ZaxKellens> Which makes Dragon Age a 2nd generation rip

[3:06] <Miclee> Are you fucking kidding me?

[3:07] <Azathoth> WHAT
[3:07] <Azathoth> SPACE
[3:07] <Azathoth> MARINES
[3:07] <ZaxKellens> I love Ico, and Shadow of the Colossus
[3:07] <ZaxKellens> Great stories
[3:07] <Azathoth> the only games that have space marines are quake, doom, and warhammer 40k games
[3:07] <Azathoth> and halo
[3:08] <ZaxKellens> And ME
[3:08] <liq3> halo is just marines.
[3:08] <liq3> not "space marines"
[3:08] <Miclee> ME doesn't have fucking space marines.

[3:08] <ZaxKellens> tfaal : Didn't need it
[3:08] <Azathoth> well apparently any soldiers in space are automatically labeled as space marines, liq3
[3:08] <SireTRM> liq3, have you seen the new campaign trailer?
[3:08] <liq3> Best storyline: Aquaria.
[3:08] <ZaxKellens> It was a beautiful and touching game
[3:08] <SireTRM> You have combat in orbit.
[3:08] <Dude000> and stereotypical "guys i'm badass look at my facial hair and muscles"
[3:08] <Azathoth> where is that in ME?
[3:08] <tfaal> ZaxKellens: S'what I'm sayin'.
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> OH
[3:09] <Azathoth> dude000 obviously has never even given the game a shot
[3:09] <Dude000> yes
[3:09] <Azathoth> so i don't think he has any place to be talking shit
[3:09] <Dude000> mass effect
[3:09] <Miclee> Neither has Zax
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> That it's that awesome even without talkies
[3:09] <Dude000> is every game ever
[3:09] <Azathoth> are you serious?
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> I've played ME before
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> It's horrible
[3:09] <Miclee> Dude000, talk about the end of Mass Effect then, same with you Zax.
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> I would rather read Twilight
[3:09] <liq3> I've played ME. I got bored of it.
[3:09] <Miclee> 30 seconds to tell me as much as possible.
[3:09] <Miclee> Go.
[3:09] <liq3> The combat was ludicriously repetitive.
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> What, the suicide run in ME2 or the ME1 end?
[3:09] <Dude000> never played it
[3:09] <Dude000> seen gameplay
[3:09] <Miclee> Either.
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> I could never get to the end

[3:09] <Dude000> story of my life
[3:09] <Miclee> Dude000, don't fucking talk, then.
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> It was so horrible I couldn't get very far
[3:09] <Miclee> Zax, you too.
[3:09] <Miclee> Stfu
[3:09] <Azathoth> holy shit
[3:10] <Dude000> what
[3:10] <ZaxKellens> The furthest in ME was to where you first were in that big base with all the freaky aliens and such
[3:10] <Azathoth> you people are so shallow
[3:10] <Dude000> does the game get really good at the end
[3:10] * Cial (chatzilla@209-42-181-147.wispnet.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)

[3:10] <Miclee> The game gets really good everywhere.
[3:10] <Azathoth> at least zax gave it a shot
[3:10] <liq3> Combat is terrible the whole game...
[3:10] <Miclee> Zax gave up because he hates games.
[3:10] <ZaxKellens> How long is it gonna take till you guys realize I'm just effin with you?
[3:10] <Miclee> That thought was in my mind.
[3:11] <ZaxKellens> That thought is right, you made yourselves easy targets
[3:11] <Azathoth> fuck off zax

[3:11] <Dude000> well i was semi-serious
[3:11] <ZaxKellens> Truthfully though
[3:11] <ZaxKellens> I couldn't get too far in it
[3:11] <Miclee> Because you fail hard.

[3:12] <Dude000> halo's boring too
[3:12] <ZaxKellens> It was fun, what I played, other than the loading screen thing
[3:12] <ZaxKellens> Trying to play off as not a loading screen

[3:13] <Azathoth> dead space did have very few loads
[3:13] <ZaxKellens> Brb, I need more salad
[3:13] <zaneo> mass effect 1 had really slow elevators
[3:13] <Miclee> I'd rather have what Mass Effect did than loading screens.
[3:13] <Azathoth> i think dead space loaded each room individually
[3:13] <Azathoth> which is why it took some time to open a door
[3:14] <Ominus> yeah
[3:14] <Azathoth> but it resulted in loading times only being between chapters
[3:14] <Miclee> EA better somehow announce more things within the next couple days.
[3:14] <liq3> Morrowind has the best loading system i've seen. :/
[3:14] <liq3> Loading screen, but they loaded incredibly quick most of the time.
[3:14] <ZaxKellens> Is it just me, or is salad delicious?
[3:14] <Dude000> also valve is supposed to reveal things at 7pm pst
[3:14] <Dude000> so
[3:14] <Dude000> or something
[3:14] <Miclee> Says where, Dude000?
[3:14] <Azathoth> speaking of generic shooters :|
[3:14] <Dude000> idk
[3:15] <Dude000> my friend's yelling this at me
[3:15] <ZaxKellens> Your friend is rood
[3:15] <ZaxKellens> Yelling at you
[3:15] <ZaxKellens> Tell him IRC says he's rood
[3:15] <Azathoth> i'm only following the half-life series because it has good mods and because i want to find out who the fuck gman is
[3:15] <Azathoth> the games themselves are kind of boring :\
[3:15] <ZaxKellens> GMan is your father
[3:16] <Dude000> Rood has several distinct meanings, all derived from the same basic etymology. The two most significant are an obsolete English measure of area, and a term for a cross or crucifix, especially a large one in a church.
[3:16] <Dude000> i don't think my friend is a cross
[3:16] <sppt_> liq3, the only shitty thing is, morrowind is really slow on my pc, and uh, i pretty much got the latest hardware :\

[3:17] <Ominus> i dont think at all :(
[3:17] <Miclee> No, he's Ordonfree.
[3:17] <sppt_> well liq3 that probably was due to installing mods to make it look like a modern game
[3:17] <liq3> sppt_: altho the xbox let me save 1-2 games on the HDD (which made loading and such much much faster).
[3:17] <ZaxKellens> Gman is Gordon's father~

[3:17] <liq3> Normal morrowind would run at like 300+ FPS on that.
[3:18] <liq3> if it's not, you got some kind of software issues most likely. :/
[3:18] <sppt_> liq3, the list i got it from is a list that's used a lot iirc
[3:18] <AndrewPH> sppt_, You installed too many mods, too many hires textures, and you set your MGE view distance etc too high
[3:18] <liq3> avoid the gfx upgrades then?

[3:39] <Obtuse_goose> a guy calls you up and says
[3:39] <liq3> seriously, how hard is it to make a cruise missile to intercept?
[3:39] <Obtuse_goose> hey
[3:39] <Cyrex> uh liq
[3:39] <vede> Your intelligence! It's dropping at a geometric rate!
[3:39] <Obtuse_goose> electronics are down
[3:39] <Malikat> liq3: pretty fucking hard
[3:39] <Azathoth> liq3, it's pretty fucking hard
[3:40] <Azathoth> AHH
[3:40] <Cyrex> that would spread the fallout over WAY further areas
[3:40] <liq3> And nukes aren't pretty fuckingg hard?
[3:40] <Azathoth> mali D:
[3:40] <Malikat> imagine throwing a baseball at another baseball
[3:40] <ZaxKellens> Radiation is delicious
[3:40] <ZaxKellens> Question : Would you believe me if I told you I work with radioactive materials?
[3:40] <liq3> Cyrex: Mmmmm?
[3:40] <Azathoth> no
[3:40] <Malikat> but the first baseball is going 18,000 miles per hour
[3:40] <ZaxKellens> You'd be wrong if you didn't believe me
[3:40] <Malikat> and you don't know exactly where it is
[3:40] <Cyrex> ICBM nukes fly in almost low orbit
[3:40] <vede> ZaxKellens, I'd believe pretty much anyone if they said they worked with radioactive materials.
[3:40] <Cyrex> the fallout range would be huge
[3:41] <Obtuse_goose> *Emp* *Guy on radio calls you up* WE'VE BEEN EMP'D ELECTRONICS ARE DOWN
[3:41] <Obtuse_goose> then how are you calling me
[3:41] <liq3> Your basing that on what?
[3:41] <Azathoth> i'd imagine lasers are the way to go for missile interception
[3:41] <Malikat> nukes are actually fragile, if you destroy the bomb before it detonates, you don't have as bad of an explosion
[3:41] <ZaxKellens> vede : I work with two radiactive materials, namely Americium and Cesium
[3:41] <Cyrex> on logic
[3:41] <liq3> ^
[3:41] <liq3> Malikat is right.
[3:41] <Obtuse_goose> why dont we jsut develop a tool gun
[3:41] <Cyrex> The fallout would still drift and spread
[3:41] <Obtuse_goose> and use the remover tool
[3:41] <Azathoth> destroying a nuclear warhead doesn't make it detonate
[3:42] <Cyrex> depends on how you destroy it
[3:42] <Malikat> Cyrex: most of the fallout in a nuclear explosion is bomb casing that was made radioactive by the explosion
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Just send the bomb to Canada and all will be fine
[3:42] <Obtuse_goose> oh
[3:42] <vede> For example, if you destroy it by detonating it, it detonates.
[3:42] <Malikat> bomb casing / local debris
[3:42] <Obtuse_goose> i see what you did
[3:42] <liq3> Haha very little local debris in the sky.
[3:42] <liq3> :P
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Best way to get rid of a bomb is explode it where nobody cares
[3:42] <Obtuse_goose> Plane
[3:42] <Malikat> most modern nukes need to be detonated in an EXTREMELY precise way to go nuclear
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Canada
[3:43] <Obtuse_goose> RAMIEZ USE YOUR AKIMBO THROWING KNIVES TO TAKE OUT THAT TAC NUKE
[3:43] <liq3> Also isn't low orbit like right in the "hardfull stuff doesn't get past here" part of teh atmosphere? :/

[3:44] <ZaxKellens> He NEVER updates the damned site
[3:44] <Obtuse_goose> yeah
[3:44] <vede> It's just the most devastating in orbit.

[3:46] <Obtuse_goose> yes
[3:46] <Malikat> in an entire continent?
[3:46] <Malikat> unlikely

[3:46] <liq3> I doubt it.

[3:46] <liq3> Maybe japan.
[3:46] <Obtuse_goose> i remeber watching a documentary on weapons
[3:46] <liq3> but japan is small landmass wise.
[3:46] <ZaxKellens> Maybe Australia if you use 3 of them

[3:47] <liq3> Australia is huge. o.o
[3:47] <Obtuse_goose> and they higher it was the more powerful
[3:47] <Obtuse_goose> for instance
[3:47] <ZaxKellens> Yeah, b ut it's all outback and koalas
[3:47] <vede> When an EMP is released at a high enough altitude, it can go REALLY, REALLY fuckin' far.
[3:47] <liq3> that's the point.
[3:47] <Malikat> too high, though
[3:47] <Obtuse_goose> if you detonated a nuke from low orbit above the venter of usa
[3:47] <liq3> hitting it all is very hard.
[3:47] <liq3> :P
[3:47] <ZaxKellens> You just need three to take out the places that actually have electricity

[3:49] <Obtuse_goose> no
[3:49] <Obtuse_goose> get a fuse
[3:49] <ZaxKellens> And apparently, if you put a huge block of ice under it when you set it off, you make a bomb

[3:57] <Cial> so like 6 for Road Warrior?
[3:57] <Cial> 5 for Mad Max

[4:25] <Snowman> BANHammer
[4:25] <slowriot> what material?
[4:25] <vurtual> steel

[4:30] <ZaxKellens> Silver or better basically
[4:30] <slowriot> i just got my archery skill to 150 or so
[4:30] <slowriot> then i can open the door, step back into the corridor
[4:30] <slowriot> and shoot round the corner

[4:30] <ZaxKellens> Tomorrow

[4:30] <slowriot> tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow

[4:35] <slowriot> the only steam we have comes out of a kettle
[4:35] <ZaxKellens> I don't wanna be worn like an old gym sock

[4:35] <ClassiestMedic> does anyone know how to block fucking mrimawega ads
[4:35] <slowriot> last game i paid for was Terminal Velocity
[4:35] <Cyrex> Fucking logic how does it work
[4:35] <ClassiestMedic> primawega*
[4:35] <slowriot> and that was in 1996
[4:35] <vurtual> you're a pirate
[4:35] <slowriot> on 6 floppies
[4:35] <vurtual> leave these grounds immediately
[4:35] <slowriot> the cd version was out, that year
[4:35] <vurtual> as we do not take kind to them
[4:35] <slowriot> but a double speed cd drive was necessary
[4:35] <slowriot> and they cost ??180 then
[4:35] <slowriot> which i did not have
[4:35] <Cyrex> I don't really care about pirates
[4:36] <ZaxKellens> You'll be worn by an inmate named bubba one day, won'tcha?
[4:36] <Cyrex> as long as you don't pirate indie games
[4:36] <slowriot> having just spend ??260 on a 14k serial fax modem
[4:36] <Cyrex> then you should be hung by the balls
[4:36] <vurtual> & found that one menu
[4:36] <slowriot> Cyrex: can we pirate indie games if we make indie games?

[4:36] <slowriot> vurtual: plate armour... that's the trick, i forgot
[4:37] <Lord_Aidan> Wut.
[4:37] <slowriot> it *is* a bit of a tradeoff, plate is nice
[4:37] <slowriot> shields are a joke though
[4:37] <slowriot> buy a cart post haste, you'll need it for dungeons
[4:37] <slowriot> forget the horse though - train your running up
[4:37] <slowriot> your running gets better the more you do it
[4:37] <slowriot> after a few hours of playing, if you're serious, you can actually RUN faster than a horse

[4:37] <slowriot> not to mention climbing and jumping...
[4:37] <Cyrex> everyone uses it
[4:38] <ZaxKellens> I don't
[4:38] <Cyrex> that's no fun
[4:38] <ZaxKellens> I never used Fast Travel
[4:38] <Cyrex> almost everyone
[4:38] <Cyrex> you lose out on so much
[4:38] <slowriot> i've never even had a computer that can run fallout 3
[4:38] <vurtual> this warhammer is wonderful
[4:38] <vurtual> it hurts imps
[4:38] <Cyrex> same if you do it in red dead redemption
[4:38] <slowriot> (which made me angry)
[4:38] <vurtual> after an imp one-hit killed me
[4:38] <vurtual> I oen-hit killed it
[4:38] <vurtual> similar, bats
[4:38] <slowriot> vurtual: pwn
[4:38] <ZaxKellens> Haha
[4:38] <ZaxKellens> I need a bear
[4:38] <slowriot> vurtual: when you first leave privateer's hold... for me, it was the most poetic experience of any computer game
[4:38] <ZaxKellens> Then I can throw it on peple
[4:38] <ZaxKellens> people*
[4:39] <slowriot> after all that grubby claustrophobic fighting in cramped dark dungeons
[4:39] <slowriot> yuo open that door
[4:39] <slowriot> and the music...
[4:39] <slowriot> the snow

[4:39] <slowriot> the trees
[4:39] <vurtual> THERE'S AN OUTSIDE?
[4:39] <slowriot> the fog
[4:39] <slowriot> the horizon
[4:39] <vurtual> I thought it was like NetHack
[4:39] <slowriot> the FREEDOM
[4:39] <slowriot> you can walk anywhere
[4:39] <ZaxKellens> There's outside, yes
[4:39] <Cyrex> also just thought of something
[4:39] <slowriot> you have a real world, it feels infinite
[4:39] <Snowman> Hey
[4:39] <Snowman> Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?
[4:39] <Cyrex> you can make a small gap with a stair piece and a block above it
[4:39] <ZaxKellens> Sssss
[4:39] <ZaxKellens> boom
[4:39] <Snowman> Buy a Justin Bieber Album
[4:39] <slowriot> vurtual: when you first get out... just take some time, and enjoy the feel of it
[4:39] <Cyrex> will the new water flow through that space
[4:39] <Cyrex> since it's small enough
[4:39] <ZaxKellens> Cyrex : yes, it will
[4:40] * Jat is now known as Jat-afk
[4:40] <Cyrex> Awesome
[4:40] <Cyrex> would be a good way to regulate flows
[4:40] <ZaxKellens> Since water will flow in halfblocks from the looks of it
[4:40] <SireTRM> Lame person hosting the Ubisoft thing. . .
[4:40] <SireTRM> Less than half blocks, I think
[4:40] <slowriot> one millionth blocks
[4:40] <slowriot> voxels
[4:40] <ZaxKellens> Halfblocks dammit
[4:40] <slowriot> vomit blocks
[4:40] <ZaxKellens> Or I stab you in the throat with a Splayd

[5:17] <x2yzh9> Er, the one that you have to buy/
[5:17] <x2yzh9> What objects can you build?
[5:17] <vurtual> this is way more than one skeleton
[5:17] <Gunmage> infdev
[5:17] <Gunmage> Is like
[5:17] <Gunmage> Regular
[5:17] <Gunmage> x10000000
[5:17] <vurtual> the maps are 8x the size of the surface of the Earth for one
[5:17] <Gunmage> Because the map is infinitly massive.
[5:18] <vurtual> It's actually updated, it's not per-month it's a one-time buy, silly
[5:18] <Gunmage> One time buy, yeah
[5:18] <Gunmage> I would get it
[5:18] <vurtual> I got it for free last christmas \o/
[5:18] <Gunmage> You craft armor and weapons, tools, farm stuff
[5:18] <Gunmage> Its awesome
[5:19] <Gunmage> Can you build higher up than the clouds in infdev?
[5:20] <rob`> about twenty blocks, now
[5:20] <rob`> he recently changed the cloud height
[5:20] <Gunmage> aw
[5:20] <rob`> it's a 128 height map, diamonds are at 18 or lower, lava is 64 below water level
[5:20] <Gunmage> Does lava insta kill?
[5:20] <zaneo> no
[5:21] <rob`> nope, but it's more or less guaranteed death
[5:21] <Gunmage> How many hearts does it take off?
[5:21] <zaneo> 3 or 4?
[5:21] <rob`> one per tick?
[5:21] <Gunmage> Oh snap
[5:21] <rob`> well, if you never dig below you, you'll be fine
[5:21] <Gunmage> Better make a good mine then >_>

[5:21] <zaneo> it's hard to get out of it
[5:21] <Gunmage> Staircase tactics go
[5:21] <rob`> a ladder gets you out of it fast
[5:21] <zaneo> ladders will burn later
[5:21] <rob`> and if you can eat enough food, you'll outlast it
[5:22] <Gunmage> Do you find ore alot down there?
[5:22] <rob`> fire goes out eventually
[5:22] <rob`> ore isn't rare, but diamond is very difficult to find

[5:23] * Cial is now known as Cial_the_Critic
[5:23] <Gunmage> Where do I get the stuff for flint and tinder
[5:23] <Gunmage> Well you need an iron bar
[5:23] <Gunmage> But what do I get the other thing from?
[5:24] <Cial_the_Critic> flint from gravel
[5:24] <rob`> dig gravel, get flint
[5:24] <Cial_the_Critic> ninja'd
[5:24] <rob`> gravel is occasionally hard to find
[5:24] <rob`> but it's usually in inland lakes
[5:24] <Shadox> <rob`> gravel is occasionally hard to find
[5:24] <Shadox> really?
[5:25] <Shadox> because i find a lot of it
[5:25] <vurtual> so I got out
[5:25] <vurtual> also
[5:25] <Cial_the_Critic> then craft them together i think with irn in a c shape and one flint to the side
[5:25] <vurtual> I killed myself roaming
[5:25] <vurtual> from exhaustion.
[5:25] <vurtual> ???
[5:25] <Cial_the_Critic> *iron
[5:25] <vurtual> one iron and one flint
[5:25] <Cial_the_Critic> oh..
[5:25] <Cial_the_Critic> the formula changed
[5:25] <Gunmage> Well, I just need to find some frekin iron ore
[5:26] <vurtual> slowriot, how does this make sense?
[5:26] <vurtual> I ran until I passed out?
[5:26] <slowriot> vurtual: well, you do get exhaustion
[5:26] <slowriot> and if you pass out in the wild... you're liable to be eaten by wild animals
[5:26] <vurtual> THERE ARE NO ANIMALS!
[5:26] <slowriot> i recommend either not running, or er... fast travel
[5:26] <vurtual> not "you can no longer run", not "you pass out", it's "you pass out to death"
[5:26] <slowriot> to the nearest town
[5:26] <vurtual> I was bunny hopping around :(
[5:26] <slowriot> well, you pass out... and death occurs occasionally, if you're weak
[5:27] <slowriot> generally when you pass out you just get microsleeps and you don't die
[5:27] <slowriot> but i guess your character's not too tough
[5:27] <slowriot> and there is a good bit of wildlife about
[5:29] <Gunmage> Woot, struck more coal
[5:29] <Gunmage> IRON, YEEEEEES
[5:29] <vurtual> ...how do I fast travel?
[5:30] <vurtual> also I think I levelled up at least once
[5:30] <vurtual> got the ability to add stat points.
[5:30] <TrueWolves> holyshit
[5:30] <vurtual> decided to bring up my speed so my OCD thirst didn't rage about having one average stat
[5:30] <TrueWolves> Notch /did/ resort to levels of water.
[5:31] <vurtual> next he will make ASCII
[5:31] <Cial_the_Critic> sooo me and a friend are thinking about starting a jihad against Ubisoft now...
[5:31] <vurtual> or maybe DOS style graphics
[5:31] <slowriot> vurtual: T...
[5:31] <vurtual> that'd be cool
[5:31] <vurtual> fog, darkness, low resolutino
[5:31] <vurtual> T give sme "foot", "horse", "cart", and "ship"
[5:31] <slowriot> oh
[5:31] <slowriot> sorry]
[5:31] <vurtual> and foot is the only option
[5:31] <slowriot> there's another button
[5:31] <vurtual> which makes me walk
[5:31] <slowriot> check what your controls are bound to
[5:31] <slowriot> map i think
[5:31] <slowriot> so tab
[5:31] <Gunmage> I actually like the graphics
[5:31] <vurtual> travel map?
[5:31] <slowriot> you can sort by towns, dungeons, pubs, etc...
[5:31] <vurtual> that's b for me
[5:32] <vurtual> since tab is ready weapon
[5:32] <slowriot> brighter dots = bigger
[5:32] <slowriot> ok, well, that one then
[5:32] <slowriot> you can search it too
[5:32] <vurtual> I want a dos-ly graphics mode for minecraft now :(
[5:32] <slowriot> you're in daggerfall, and the capital is the eponymous daggerfall, where a lot of nice things are
[5:32] <slowriot> but don't go straight there, explore a bit first

[6:06] <Snowman> All halos suck
[6:06] <EmpiresBane> it'll introduce some variation into the gameplay
[6:06] <Shadaez> I don't really like Halo, but HAlo 3 and reach play extremely differently

[6:56] <LuciferZ> I. Fucking hate. Windows Update.
[6:56] <Dude000> turn it off
[6:56] <vurtual> notch? Relying on mods?
[6:56] <vurtual> WHAT?
[6:56] <Dude000> also i thought notch said he might
[6:56] <LuciferZ> Too late now.
[6:56] <Kokopure> Did it kindly shut down your computer for you?
[6:56] <TrueWolves> This is what Notch said.
[6:56] <vurtual> I think it needs more torches, crix.
[6:57] <LuciferZ> Yes it did, without saving the fucking drawing I had open
[6:57] <Crix> psh
[6:57] <Crix> who needs toches
[6:57] <Dude000> If people are REALLY in love with their games, I could probably do something that converts only the terrain (no mobs, no chest contents, not keeping track of the time of day), or possibly work with some volunteer and give out information on how to write a level converter. If you wish to do this, first make sure you understand the NBT file format.
[6:57] <TrueWolves> He's not making his own converter becuase it's /indev/ as in /indevelopment/
[6:57] <Kokopure> It's alpha
[6:57] <Kokopure> Not a priority
[6:57] <LuciferZ> So the drawing that Animator bribed me for is totally gone.
[6:57] <Crix> I'd rather have him work than make us a converter

[7:13] <vurtual> minecraft having made-up named regions and places in generated worlds

[7:13] <Azathoth> 999 stacks were around since the beginning of infdev
[7:14] <EmpiresBane> Dezerus, it's not a graphics issue
[7:14] <vurtual> 64 is good for the datas-bits, Vicrry
[7:14] <EmpiresBane> it's the lighting engine

[7:14] <Kokopure> Vurt, i think i'd like that
[7:14] <Dezerus> My card is the Nvidia GeForce 9500 GT.
[7:14] <sorre> how about implementing maps, with the ability to name regions yourself
[7:14] <Azathoth> notch is a programmer. we like powers of 2
[7:14] <Vicrry> I figured - 64 = 2^6
[7:14] <Dman757> 2^6 = 64
[7:14] <Dezerus> What do you mean, it'll go away when he updates?
[7:15] <EmpiresBane> when he updates the lighting engine
[7:15] <Vicrry> But gamers tend to prefer 50/100 - easier numbers on the brain
[7:15] <Dezerus> When is that?
[7:15] <Dman757> 100000
[7:15] <EmpiresBane> when he gets rid of indev and replaces it with infdev
[7:15] <Dude000> yeah
[7:15] <Dezerus> Ah.
[7:15] <Dude000> 64 is kinda arbitrary when you don't think powers of 2

[7:16] <Vicrry> As soon as I saw 64 I recognized it as a power of 2, and suspected variable limits or something, but m3h
[7:17] <Azathoth> erm. what empiresbane?
[7:17] <EmpiresBane> i think he just plans on putting limits
[7:17] <EmpiresBane> Azathoth, he chose 64 for memory reasons
[7:17] <Azathoth> um no
[7:17] <EmpiresBane> ...
[7:17] <Azathoth> stacks of > 64 have been around forever
[7:17] <Gunmage> You know
[7:17] <EmpiresBane> um... yes
[7:17] <Gunmage> repair hammers would be nice

[7:18] <Dude000> wait
[7:18] <sorre> repair hammers would be broken
[7:18] <Dman757> Minecraft dudes only count in base 2 they only have two square arms
[7:18] <sorre> especially if they stacked
[7:18] <Azathoth> meaning he's using more than 6 bits of data for the count
[7:18] <Dude000> base 2 is binary
[7:18] <Dman757> exactly
[7:18] <EmpiresBane> Azathoth, he just hasn't gotten around to changing it. probably for debugging reasons
[7:18] <Vicrry> Repair hamma would be sweet - especially if it doesn't break itself :P

[7:19] <Dragoon> But no silver :L
[7:19] <sorre> magic in general would be handy
[7:19] <Azathoth> hmm. i wonder if he plans on using a byte... but what would he use those other two bits for?
[7:20] <sorre> limited-time light magic would be a real lifesaver
[7:20] <EmpiresBane> Azathoth, special stuff.
[7:20] <Dragoon> Yeah

[7:20] <Crix> First off
[7:20] <Crix> 64 is a good limit
[7:20] <EmpiresBane> like enchantment data
[7:20] <Dragoon> Or flare type things
[7:20] <Crix> 128 is a lot
[7:20] <Crix> and 256 is even more
[7:20] <Azathoth> i agree crix
[7:20] <Dude000> scale down
[7:20] <Dude000> 100
[7:20] <Crix> meh
[7:20] <sorre> the catch: in order to cast a spell, you have to find the scroll, and you have to prepare the spell
[7:20] <Crix> base two works out
[7:20] <vurtual> welp I think I failed that whole mission there
[7:20] <Crix> more often
[7:20] <Azathoth> but empiresbane is saying he did it for memory reasons, which just doesn't seem very likely
[7:20] <sorre> by having it in a quickslot for a certain period of time before use
[7:20] <Crix> in terms of numbers
[7:20] <vurtual> let's try something else like
[7:20] <Crix> also
[7:20] <Crix> its only 6 bits
[7:20] <Crix> that leaves 2 bits
[7:20] <vurtual> run accross the continent!
[7:20] <Crix> for other info
[7:20] <Crix> if needed
[7:20] <Azathoth> that's waht i said
[7:20] <Vicrry> Repair hammer that doesn't break or uses cheap materials like stone would be nice - I would actually use diamond tools then
[7:21] <Dragoon> I hate waiting for daylight...
[7:21] <Azathoth> but what other info?
[7:21] <Gunmage> Magic would be awesome
[7:21] <Crix> I don't know
[7:21] <Crix> maybe blocks will have properties in the future
[7:21] <EmpiresBane> Azathoth, things like enchantments
[7:21] <Gunmage> All I want is a diamond sword

[7:21] <Crix> all i want is chickens

[7:21] <Vicrry> Diamond is too rare to actually do anything with, other than look at in a chest :P
[7:21] <sorre> turn day into night, or cast a localized field to make a tree grow faster
[7:21] <vurtual> Sun's song
[7:21] <Azathoth> so he can have a whopping total of 4 additional flags
[7:21] <Dman757> 0110100
[7:22] <Dude000> ocarina based magic
[7:22] <vurtual> admittedly that'd be incredibly powerful
[7:22] <Zaneo> well saving in mutiples of 2 does make sense... if you use a number like 100 then you have to rserver 128, but only use 100
[7:22] <sorre> or better
[7:22] <Zaneo> reserve*
[7:22] <Azathoth> i think he just uses an int and came up with an arbitrary limit of 64
[7:22] <Dude000> god damn now i want to go play zelda
[7:22] <tfaal> It would be interesting if you had to, say, eat once a day to keep from losing hearts. That would create constant demand on MP survival servers.
[7:22] <Vicrry> lol
[7:22] <EmpiresBane> i really hope this new water doesn't turn into a lagfest
[7:22] <sorre> conjure a temporary floating bubble of water
[7:22] <Vicrry> Go do Dude000
[7:22] <Dragoon> YES OCARINAS :D
[7:22] <sorre> you could use it to swim up

[7:22] <tfaal> EmpiresBane: It's not quite like the DF system.
[7:22] <Dude000> don't feel like blowing into my cartridges for an hour
[7:22] <vurtual> so thinking about my previous suggestion I can only say
[7:22] <vurtual> I want to sunder spacetime
[7:22] <EmpiresBane> tfaal, i know
[7:22] <EmpiresBane> that doesn't change things
[7:23] <Crix> @vicrry naah, diamond is good for swords
[7:23] <tfaal> According to Notch, it's fast.
[7:23] <Crix> only need 2 of them and the sword lasts for a LONG time
[7:23] <sorre> let's see...
[7:23] <vurtual> just toss dust into the air, which turns into sparkles, the entire room feels devoid of light otherwise, what's left is being distorted by a massive rip
[7:23] <Crix> also
[7:23] <EmpiresBane> on his computer....
[7:23] <Azathoth> i can't wait to see the water in action
[7:23] <sorre> some sort of magical enchantment to allow faster running would be nice
[7:23] <Gunmage> So we need
[7:23] <Gunmage> magic
[7:23] <Crix> it'd be nice to have OTHER blocks besides cobblestone underground
[7:23] <Gunmage> Giant enemy boss monsters
[7:23] <vurtual> then you rip a straight out portal into whatever chosen plane
[7:23] <sorre> higher jumping... slowfall, maybe?
[7:23] <Azathoth> my biggest worry is that it will spread too slow and be more like a slime
[7:23] <vurtual> which stays for a while

[7:24] <Gunmage> Whats wrong with boats
[7:24] <Azathoth> oh well. it's cute anyway
[7:24] <Dman757> Keep things stone crafty
[7:24] <sorre> a boat is fine too
[7:24] <Gunmage> And MP combat
[7:24] <Dman757> no planes
[7:24] <Gunmage> So we can have pirates!
[7:24] <EmpiresBane> he'll probably speed it up in the future
[7:24] <vurtual> w/ mechanics and some good skill, you could make a wand to fire a specific planar or transplanar portal, and hook it up to a turrety thing on the ceiling, controlling it from a central thingy
[7:24] <vurtual> and then stage sieges that way
[7:24] <AndrewPH> Hehe
[7:24] <Vicrry> It'd be awesome to has a set of tools that I take care of, as opposed to 1000 stone/10 steel pickaxes I carry in inventory and treat like Bic pens
[7:24] <Gunmage> what
[7:24] <AndrewPH> starbucks is giving all customers free wifi
[7:25] <AndrewPH> unlimited
[7:25] <sorre> intraplanar portals would be pretty incredible
[7:25] <Dude000> i still think he should come out with multi-player before he adds in anything game changing
[7:25] <Gunmage> maybe
[7:25] <Gunmage> With enough runes and stuff
[7:25] <Gunmage> You can make a big teleportation circle
[7:25] <AndrewPH> note to self: go to starbucks and download games all day.
[7:25] <sorre> but, of course, this kind of magic has to be rare and expensive
[7:25] <Gunmage> gate*
[7:25] <Azathoth> so starbucks is doing what you'd expect in the first place and everyone wants to suck their dick for it?
[7:25] <EmpiresBane> Dude000, he's getting motivated
[7:25] <tfaal> Gunmage: Issue with boats is that they have to collide with entities, and can't be blocks. That's completely unprecedented, and will require a lot of coding.
[7:25] <vurtual> sorre, not really
[7:25] <Gunmage> well
[7:25] <vurtual> looking back on how I had imagined magic, it would be fine if it was just not easy
[7:25] <sorre> keeping it rare and expensive keeps it cool
[7:25] <Gunmage> Look at sheep
[7:25] <Dude000> the more he procrastinates multi-player and adds more things
[7:26] <Dude000> the more balancing he has to work on in bulk
[7:26] <vurtual> Want to construct a permenant portal to another plane?
[7:26] <Gunmage> Sheep aren't like regular blocks
[7:26] <PixelEater> does anyone know what this electricity server i heard of is called? :|
[7:26] <EmpiresBane> Dude000, most of the things haven'tbeen too major
[7:26] * Krnau (moi@dsl-olubrasgw1-fe42fb00-185.dhcp.inet.fi) has joined #minecraft
[7:26] <Gunmage> He could just make a boat looking version of sheep
[7:26] <Dude000> yeah
[7:26] <Gunmage> But bigger
[7:26] <Dude000> but a simple thing
[7:26] <Vicrry> anyway - Magic ain't really my thing. I kinda like Minecraft's "You. Island. What you can make. GO!" theme.
[7:26] <Dude000> such as adding boats
[7:26] <Gunmage> With floating properties
[7:26] <sorre> hooooooooooo
[7:26] <vurtual> Get all the resources for the various structure, craft all the magical items needed for it, research and record the proper spells, and build yourself a giant, hardy room to handle the eldritchen power
[7:26] <Azathoth> yeah. i personally don't want to see magic in minecraft
[7:26] <sorre> i just had the best idea ever
[7:26] <vurtual> then maybe hide it underground
[7:26] <vurtual> Then, you assemble this without attracting a troublemaker
[7:26] <vurtual> boom, portal occours
[7:26] <tfaal> Gunmage: I forgot that mobs could collide with players. Interesting.
[7:27] <Azathoth> i don't think magic really belongs :\
[7:27] <vurtual> ooooooh
[7:27] <vurtual> who needs QUESTS
[7:27] <Azathoth> also boats can just be entities
[7:27] <vurtual> When we could have REAL MINECRAFT CULTISTS
[7:27] <Gunmage> But just disable random movement
[7:27] <sorre> http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda06/Characters/SeaTurtle.jpg
[7:27] <vurtual> summoning evil powers to conquqer server

[7:27] <tfaal> What would be cool would be a generalized way to make collections of blocks into entities. But that's a bit pie-in-the sky.
[7:27] <vurtual> the smallest canoes would be
[7:27] <sorre> giant-ass sea turtle you can ride around on
[7:27] <vurtual> tfaal
[7:27] <sorre> it's like a tiny roaming island
[7:28] <vurtual> we can have anything
[7:28] <vurtual> if we try hard enuogh
[7:28] <Gunmage> Well it could just be technically an NPC
[7:28] <Gunmage> Like sheep and pigs
[7:28] <tfaal> vurtual: You mean if Notch tries hard enough. That, we have less control of. ;)
[7:28] <Gunmage> But only gets movement commands from players
[7:28] <Gunmage> lol
[7:28] <sorre> would giant turtles not be the greatest thing ever?
[7:28] <vurtual> just one thing about magic I honestly want: None of this "WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A MAGICAL ITEM/MIDICHLORIANS/SOME KIND OF THING DOING THIS FOR YOU"
[7:28] <Animator> Guys, I made a sprited version of a banhammer that LuciferZ drew for me: http://a.yfrog.com/img715/5425/authoritat.png
[7:28] <vurtual> I want to be a wizard of my own merit, thank you very much.
[7:28] <Gunmage> What, does he not try at all?
[7:28] <Vicrry> Enchantments might be alright if they're rather limited: drop in a gold and add durability, make it regen, faster, etc. But I'd stay away from anything really overt if I was Notch
[7:29] <Obtuse_goose> i am here again
[7:29] <Gunmage> We still just need basics
[7:29] <Gunmage> Like MP infdev
[7:29] <sorre> the magic engine should be flexible
[7:29] <Dude000> as i said
[7:29] <sorre> ridiculously powerful magic effects should be possible
[7:29] <Gunmage> But the problem is, updating a multiplayer game is alot harder than updating a singleplayer version
[7:29] <vurtual> if I was notch we'd all be walking around in towns and setting off in expiditions, making our own cities, on synced servers of regions(each doing their own region to some collective map if they want), and having awesome, varied things, with a decent combat system.
[7:29] <sorre> but they should require an equally insane investment
[7:29] <vurtual> insane investment just ruins stuff man
[7:30] <Obtuse_goose> Should have it to where you can visit other peoples worlds.
[7:30] <tfaal> vurtual: Uh-huh. Cool story bro.
[7:30] <vurtual> if you just make it a challenge enough, it'd be fine
[7:30] <Obtuse_goose> but with NPC's instead of players
[7:30] <Dude000> fixed water ??? fixed trees ??? fixed caves ??? multi-player
[7:30] <Gunmage> Well
[7:30] <sorre> hmm...
[7:30] <sorre> a magic ritual overlay?
[7:30] <SnowmanHTC> And the game would have only 200 people if you made it :p
[7:30] <Gunmage> Do you want minecraft to be a class-type game?
[7:30] <vurtual> anyways guys
[7:30] <vurtual> go back to yesterday
[7:30] <Gunmage> Where you are a mage, fighter, etc?
[7:30] <vurtual> where I talked about magic
[7:30] <vurtual> and pretend I said that
[7:30] <sorre> hmm... a magic ritual overlay might actually be good
[7:30] <Obtuse_goose> The game
[7:30] <Gunmage> Or do you want it to be so people can just be everything and anything as long as theyve mined/killed enough
[7:30] <vurtual> then move all your bad ideas out of the window because you can't think outside of that
[7:31] <Gunmage> Crap, I lost
[7:31] <Dude000> omg da gaym so randumb xddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
[7:31] <SnowmanHTC> Think outside of the box.

[7:31] <Obtuse_goose> i want to see a list
[7:31] <SnowmanHTC> Rated T to M.
[7:31] <Gunmage> Orange box = Source Survival
[7:31] <vurtual> You craft bookcase, you write in the bookcase, write down spells which takes time like a furnace, go find something to do like die from spiders or something.
[7:31] <Gunmage> eh
[7:31] <vurtual> go craft a spellbook, this is not as easy as a single bookcase but you're not lazy are you? No you're a wizard.
[7:32] <vurtual> Write down the important stuff you wrote down in the bookcases
[7:32] <sorre> you coudld make magic rituals something like a mini-game of their own, with each casting
[7:32] <SnowmanHTC> How can you write without being there?
[7:32] <vurtual> Do stuff in the book, and tada, wiizaaard
[7:32] <Gunmage> I think a system where the more you use spells, the better ones you get access too would be better
[7:32] <vurtual> how can you furnace afk?
[7:32] <vurtual> a wizard did it
[7:32] <vurtual> EXP would be out of place in minecraft
[7:32] <Gunmage> Yeah

[7:32] <vurtual> no, the bookcases have magic ink and pens, which write themselves

[7:32] <Gunmage> Its all there
[7:32] <vurtual> Infact, guys, I went over this a lot.
[7:33] <vurtual> many, many times, every day, for weeks.
[7:33] <SnowmanHTC> I hate any form of magic tbh
[7:33] <Dude000> see we have a conundrum
[7:33] <Gunmage> Maybe just making the spells with paper
[7:33] <vurtual> I was bored ;_;
[7:33] <Vicrry> I wouldn't mind hiring someone to move things from one chest to another, and pay them in wood or something: I personally find harvesting/digging more fun than building. But other than having the opportunity to exchange goods and services, I not interested in MP too much
[7:33] <Gunmage> Magic makes games fun
[7:33] <sorre> i'm telling you guys, skill-based magic
[7:33] <Dude000> vurtual's system is absolutely bat-shit complex
[7:33] <Gunmage> It provides comical relief sometimes
[7:33] <vurtual> no it is not
[7:33] <sorre> it takes time, it takes practice, but it's not class-based
[7:33] <vurtual> You are a drugged fool

[7:34] <Dude000> craft spellbook
[7:34] <Gunmage> (or book)
[7:34] <Dude000> watch it write in itself
[7:34] <Gunmage> You require stuff.
[7:34] <Dude000> time
[7:34] <vurtual> no, the bookcases do it
[7:34] <EmpiresBane> what the fuck are you guys talking about?
[7:34] <Dude000> ???

[7:34] <Dude000> profit
[7:34] <Dude000> oh
[7:34] <Dude000> craft spellbook
[7:34] <vurtual> Every spell would require, invariably, lots of knowledge for it.
[7:34] <Dude000> craft bookcase
[7:34] <Gunmage> Like fireball scroll, requires of course paper, and something else
[7:35] <Dude000> watch bookcase write in spellbook?
[7:35] <Gunmage> Well yeah you put the shit in the bookcase
[7:35] <Dude000> what
[7:35] <vurtual> So you have the bookcases, which store the arcane ifnormation.
[7:35] <Gunmage> Like the furnace
[7:35] <SnowmanHTC> and requires utmost spiritual stability
[7:35] <Vicrry> How to be a business man: 1) Profit 2) Profit 3) Profit 4) ???(Just do Profit) 5) Profit (Then return to 1)
[7:35] <Gunmage> Buy low sell high
[7:35] <Gunmage> ???
[7:35] <Gunmage> Profit
[7:35] <sorre> you forgot 6) Spill oil in Gulf of Mexico, weasel out of accountability
[7:35] <Gunmage> Anways
[7:35] <Gunmage> ^
[7:35] <vurtual> Then you have the bookcases, linked together to combine capacity, and you pick a valid spell to write down(there could be prerequesits... or whatever, but you don't need those I guess)
[7:35] <Gunmage> That is a must
[7:35] <SnowmanHTC> Be polite
[7:35] <vurtual> then it furnaces for a bit, longer for some spells
[7:35] <SnowmanHTC> Be efficient
[7:35] <Dragoon> Get out pig, can't you see I'm trying to conduct science?!
[7:35] <Dude000> so
[7:36] <Dude000> while that's happening to get "first spells"
[7:36] <SnowmanHTC> Have a plan to kill everyone you meet.
[7:36] <Dude000> a fighter is already kicking some ass
[7:36] <SnowmanHTC> ???
[7:36] <vurtual> and you let it cook and now you have spells
[7:36] <Gunmage> Well
[7:36] <Gunmage> thats the magic thing
[7:36] <sorre> isn't that the way it always is, Dude000?
[7:36] <Gunmage> At first it sucks
[7:36] <SnowmanHTC> Profit!
[7:36] <Gunmage> in the end it rocks
[7:36] <sorre> magic takes longer, but is more badass later
[7:36] <Dude000> no
[7:36] <tfaal> vurtual: How do these spells work?
[7:36] <Dude000> because there's a period with no magic at all
[7:36] <SnowmanHTC> Anyway, bye
[7:36] <vurtual> Pull out that little nine-slot spellbook of yours, write down the concise version of a spell, copying that from the bookcases
[7:36] * SnowmanHTC (SnowmanHTC@sd51100a0.adsl.wanadoo.nl) Quit (Quit: ERR:Connection)
[7:36] <Gunmage> I would say fireball, iceball etc projectiles
[7:36] <Dude000> that's significantly longer than no swords at all
[7:37] <Gunmage> So he could just make a class based off of arrows
[7:37] <sorre> magic needs to be more interesting than just projectiles
[7:37] <Gunmage> So he doesnt have to write a bunch of complicated shit
[7:37] <sorre> way more interesting
[7:37] <vurtual> Now maybe this spell needs candy for it, or waving your hands, or maybe you just say "laser beaaaam"(your character)
[7:37] <Gunmage> You say that but programming stuff isnt fun
[7:37] <vurtual> You pull out dat dere spellbook into your quickbar, click mouse two, and pick yer spell. Press mouse one as needed.
[7:37] <Gunmage> Especially for one guy at this stage
[7:37] <sorre> actually, i think notch is having fun
[7:37] <vurtual> some spells require lotsa space, so they take up more slots of storage!
[7:37] <Gunmage> I wouldnt doubt, this game rocks
[7:37] <Dude000> but still
[7:37] <Gunmage> An entire spell book seems to taskful to use
[7:37] <vurtual> Some are invariably simple, and will last a long time, not wearing out. Some are really trippy like, and after a while of use, they'll vanish right outta yer tome right there!
[7:38] <Dude000> look at how long it takes to get a wooden sword, maybe some cloth armour
[7:38] <Gunmage> Scrolls that are one time one shot
[7:38] <setveen> mooooo
[7:38] <Gunmage> Or maybe even multiple shots
[7:38] <tfaal> It's a job, with all that entails, but I'd say he probably likes it more than most people any of us know.
[7:38] <vurtual> scrolls were in there too
[7:38] <Dragoon> YES! FINALLY
[7:38] <Gunmage> Oh
[7:38] <Dragoon> :D
[7:38] <sorre> i'm telling you, guys, manual rituals would balance magic perfectly
[7:38] <Gunmage> So
[7:38] <vurtual> you craft them, and put spells into them like you would a spellbook. Cept the scroll is one-use, maybe has the regeants bound to it
[7:38] <Gunmage> Those spell books could hold the scrolls
[7:38] <vurtual> since I discussed this for like, literally four hours, I am in a bad mood to deal with the same bad opposition.
[7:38] <Vicrry> Anyway - I'd just like to has a way to maintain some tools. I hate finding rare materials, taking the time and effort to carefully craft quality tools, then being forced to treat them like $.05 disposable razors.
[7:38] <Gunmage> Vurt
[7:38] <vurtual> no the spellbook is a long-term hold for all your spells
[7:38] <Gunmage> Why dont you make a thread?
[7:38] <vurtual> Threads are horrible.
[7:38] <vurtual> You should be ashamed for suggesting it.
[7:39] <sorre> >forum
[7:39] <Gunmage> You should be ashamed
[7:39] <sorre> >expedient discussion
[7:39] <sorre> oh u
[7:39] <vurtual> I will do something better still
[7:39] <Gunmage> At least keep this stuff down on notepad
[7:39] <vurtual> I WILL MAKE A WEBSITE
[7:39] <vurtual> MYYBE
[7:39] <Gunmage> meybe...meybe
[7:39] <Gunmage> But at least a thread is solid
[7:39] <tfaal> Vicrry: That's why I always make diamond into armor, swords and statues.
[7:39] <vurtual> I'd need diagrams
[7:39] <Gunmage> Here, you say your 2cents to me and everyone else
[7:39] <vurtual> because forum people are stupid
[7:39] <Gunmage> But
[7:39] <Dude000> now to turn it to a more controversial topic
[7:39] <Gunmage> Who knows if im here tommorow to back you up
[7:39] <Dude000> "guns"
[7:39] <sorre> bah
[7:39] <vurtual> Every day I will discuss
[7:40] <Gunmage> NO GUNS NO
[7:40] <sorre> guns can fuck off
[7:40] <Gunmage> GOD NO
[7:40] <Gunmage> NO
[7:40] <Vicrry> Iron isn't common enough on my map so far to use either tfaal
[7:40] <Gunmage> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[7:40] <vurtual> I will permeate my ideas into the common conscious via active presence
[7:40] <vurtual> and I shall succeeeeed
[7:40] <sorre> better bows would be nice, though
[7:40] <Gunmage> Fine
[7:40] <Dude000> i could balance guns
[7:40] <vurtual> I would, honestly, have no problem with guns in minecraft.
[7:40] <vurtual> I mean really.
[7:40] <sorre> bows that shoot farther, do more damage
[7:40] <Gunmage> But how does it hurt to have a thread
[7:40] <vurtual> What's your problem with them?
[7:40] <Gunmage> NO GUNS NO
[7:40] <Gunmage> NO
[7:40] <Gunmage> NO GOD NO PLEASE NO
[7:40] <vurtual> What's your problem?
[7:40] <vurtual> an ol' bolt-action huntin' tool too much for you?
[7:40] <Dude000> i'm thinking old guns
[7:40] <Gunmage> Office quoting
[7:40] <Dude000> like blunderbusses
[7:40] <Gunmage> The Office quoting
[7:40] <Dude000> where it takes a whole minute just to load the fucking thing
[7:40] <vurtual> I'm thinking post-WW2 and earlier
[7:40] <tfaal> Gunmage: Should be fine, as long as it's balanced. An arquebuss, done realistically, would be worse than a bow in most cases.
[7:41] <vurtual> I'm thinking guns worth using
[7:41] <Gunmage> Ugh
[7:41] <vurtual> because ye olde muskets were absolutely useless
[7:41] <Gunmage> But we have swords and bows already
[7:41] <sorre> i want battle axes
[7:41] <Gunmage> Theres already a sort of theme
[7:41] <Gunmage> I do too
[7:41] <vurtual> 'cept for pwning knights
[7:41] <Gunmage> And polearms
[7:41] <Dude000> or at least musket styled
[7:41] <sorre> big, slow-swinging, badass war axes
[7:41] <Dude000> because it's a cool style
[7:41] <vurtual> maybe proper single-shot rifles maybe?
[7:41] <vurtual> breech-loading, single-shot
[7:41] <Dude000> hell
[7:41] <Dude000> start a line of ranged weaponry
[7:42] <vurtual> slow compared to a quickly fired bow maybe, a bit costly on the resources side
[7:42] <vurtual> but powerful, and good ranged
[7:42] <Dude000> bows crossbows and guns
[7:42] <tfaal> Gunmage: Polearms would be pretty cool, if we couldn't already hit stuff from 10 feet away with our fists.
[7:42] <vurtual> 20 feet
[7:42] <Gunmage> lol
[7:42] <Gunmage> true
[7:42] <sorre> you know what minecraft needs?
[7:42] <sorre> mines
[7:42] <vurtual> highest-quality rifles might be able to pull an MOA at 150m
[7:42] <Gunmage> fix that then
[7:42] <Dude000> and on the alternate side of things
[7:42] <Dude000> melee weapons
[7:42] <sorre> the exploding kind
[7:42] <Gunmage> it needs crafts
[7:42] <Gunmage> arts and crafts
[7:42] <Dude000> swords battle axes polearms etc
[7:42] <Gunmage> like paper mache
[7:42] <vurtual> so guys
[7:42] * Gunmage is joking btw
[7:42] <vurtual> if I went into detail making a rule system for minecraft
[7:42] <vurtual> to essentially create a proper combat system
[7:42] <vurtual> Would you read it?
[7:43] <sorre> tl;dr
[7:43] <Dude000> define rule system
[7:43] <Gunmage> Yah
[7:43] <Gunmage> No guns though please
[7:43] <sorre> but seriously, yeah, i'd read it, if it was good
[7:43] <vurtual> yes guns would bei n there. Yes they would be sane, and no nobody has to actually acknowledge them
[7:43] <Dude000> spoilers: bows are just primitive guns
[7:43] <tfaal> vurtual: If you uploaded it and linked to it, rather than spamming the chat with it, then yes.
[7:43] <vurtual> yeah I would do that tfaal
[7:43] <Gunmage> bows
[7:43] <vurtual> it'd be a few hundred pages long
[7:43] <sorre> >implying bows weren't vastly superior to early guns
[7:43] <vurtual> If I was bored enough I'd list out every concievable weapon with proper statistics
[7:44] <Gunmage> are devices to throw iron by way of elastic force
[7:44] <vurtual> drawing from sources
[7:44] <Gunmage> guns
[7:44] <Dude000> guns
[7:44] <Gunmage> use an explosion
[7:44] <Gunmage> a small, contained one
[7:44] <Dude000> same shit
[7:44] <Dude000> different piles
[7:44] <Gunmage> That would be like saying throwing a rock is a form of a gun
[7:44] <sorre> or like saying a mac is a form of computer
[7:44] <Dude000> ...it is
[7:45] <FNugget> i finally looged at notch blog
[7:45] <FNugget> looked*
[7:45] <Dude000> also if you want to get technical
[7:45] <vurtual> Your fist, thrown rocks, big rocks, spears, hatchets, battleaxes, short swords, rapiers, daggers, longswords, thrown axes, claymores, hand-and-a-half swords, gusiarmes, halberds, bec-de-whatevers, cannons, muskets, shortbows, longbows, japanese versions of those
[7:45] <FNugget> 99 lava eh
[7:45] <Dude000> rock ??? spear ??? slings ??? bows ??? crossbows ??? guns
[7:45] <Dude000> and i mean throwing spears
[7:45] <vurtual> If minecraft had rules for magazine fed weapons that would be pretty funny
[7:45] <vurtual> so you could craft an assault rifle or something crazy like that
[7:46] <vurtual> the best balance is actually logically applying these as they would be in the real world, but nobody ever listens to that
[7:46] <Dude000> recoil?
[7:46] <vurtual> the fact that guns are hard to make
[7:46] <Dude000> that too
[7:46] <Dragoon> OH CHRIST SHEEP EVERYWHERE
[7:46] <vurtual> you have to stamp out parts, cast parts, make the ever-so-perfect-needing bullets
[7:46] <vurtual> creating individual bullets could take at least the time of smelting now
[7:46] <vurtual> but we'd have factories, so it'd be okay
[7:47] <vurtual> anyways brb roaming in daggerfall to think up concepts, then writing them down
[7:47] <Vicrry> I dunno why, but tools aren't just mundane objects to me. They're important, personal things that you take care of, and they'll take care of you. So Minecraft's system of carelessly tossing 1000 picks away after you've mined 20 stone goes really against my grain :P
[7:47] <vurtual> okay already have a question guys
[7:47] <liq3> Vicrry: true.
[7:47] <vurtual> how would you have stats
[7:47] * formlesstree4 (noemail@adsl-76-233-108-177.dsl.rcsntx.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:47] <vurtual> Rolled randomly? Assigned whenever? Caused by items? Recent events manipulating your abilities?
[7:47] <sorre> no stats, gtfo
[7:48] <tfaal> Vicrry: It will create an interesting economic factor, once MP is in, though.
[7:48] <liq3> Of course, logically speaking, you can't mine stone with a wood pickaxe.
[7:48] <liq3> :P
[7:48] <Vicrry> Stats, in my minecraft? EFFU!
[7:48] <tfaal> Or cut wood with wood axes.
[7:48] <EmpiresBane> nor with a gold or diamond
[7:48] <vurtual> Would you rather have "I want to run faster!" or "I am in heavy armor, I will move less dextrously, and will be physically impeded"
[7:48] <liq3> you'd have to like, find a stone on the ground, that's sharp.
[7:48] <vurtual> "This helmet makes me run faster like the speed of sound zooooom"
[7:48] <liq3> Then hack away at a tree for hours.
[7:48] <liq3> or find a branch.
[7:48] <liq3> and making an axe... :P
[7:49] * exe- (d@bbservice229.mmpnet215.tnp.pl) has joined #minecraft
[7:49] <Vicrry> Also, you could cut stone with wood. Not in the shape of a pick, but drive a wood wedge into a crack and wet it, it'll expand and drive the crack further.. It takes a while, but does definitely work
[7:49] * lighthazard (lighthazar@ool-4a58b681.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:49] <darkedone02> Gm Stranded got stats, when you are cutting wood, you increase your level, and provide perks when you reach certain levels
[7:50] <tfaal> liq3: Do remember that time is compressed and distorted in minecraft. What you just said might translate to "Punch a tree for three seconds."
[7:50] <Zaneo> after level 60 though it's boring
[7:50] <darkedone02> when you mine level is 35, you can mine gold
[7:50] * Classiest|Brb is now known as ClassiestMedic
[7:50] <sorre> god dammit
[7:50] <Vicrry> again: Stats, in my minecraft? EFFU!
[7:50] <sorre> take your level-up shit and get the hell out of here
[7:50] <sorre> i'm totally serious
[7:50] <Zaneo> I keep all my weapons and resources... nothing to do, plus pidgeon pill is abused
[7:50] <Dude000> stats
[7:50] <Dude000> depends on what you mean by stats
[7:50] <sorre> no it doesn't
[7:51] <darkedone02> although i wish that gm-stranded got more content... like something of a fantasy version where I can cast magic and use magical ingredients and enchantment.
[7:51] <sorre> if they go up over time via repetitive activity, do not want
[7:51] <tfaal> sorre: Pretty silly to get so viement about it, since even Notch considered it at one point.
[7:51] <sorre> yes, he considered it
[7:51] * Krnau- (moi@dsl-olubrasgw1-fe42fb00-185.dhcp.inet.fi) has joined #minecraft
[7:51] <sorre> and he, like everyone else at the time, decided that it was retarded
[7:51] <sorre> we've been there, and we chose not to do that
[7:51] <Dude000> if stats simply mean "i'm wearing diamond armour, i'm heavy as a fuck, walk at the speed of slow and are a tank" and "i'm wearing cloth, i'm pretty much move like minecraft players now" then
[7:51] <Dude000> yeah
[7:52] <Dude000> that's not really stats
[7:52] <Dude000> but it should happen anyway
[7:52] <Dude000> balancing being a fucking tank and being able to do anything
[7:52] * ZarroTsu[SMG2] is now known as ZarroTsu
[7:52] <Gunmage> notch considered what
[7:52] <sorre> umm...
[7:52] <sorre> 'being a fucking tank' is already balanced
[7:52] <EmpiresBane> i don't know why you guys are worrying about balancing something that doesn't exist...
[7:52] <tfaal> I don't see what's wrong with stats, if they're done well. Couple weeks of chopping wood, you get better at it.
[7:52] <sorre> by the fact that you need a huge pile of a very rare resource to do it
[7:52] * Krnau (moi@dsl-olubrasgw1-fe42fb00-185.dhcp.inet.fi) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[7:52] <darkedone02> I like stats, I like to get them to a very high level and unlock special stuff, I wish it wasn't cap at all... and that I still gain certain perks like an speed upgrade or a no-requirement on certain things, or cost less resources to <insert too item>...
[7:53] <darkedone02> tool*
[7:53] <sorre> you put stats in, and minecraft becomes grindan
[7:53] <sorre> notch pretty much spontaneously turns korean
[7:53] <Gunmage> I just found a 4 str 4 stam leather belt
[7:53] <darkedone02> not really... not unless you add in requirements on certain things
[7:53] * Krnau (moi@dsl-olubrasgw1-fe42fb00-185.dhcp.inet.fi) has joined #minecraft
[7:53] <sorre> and ceases development on minecraft, being obsessed with starcraft
[7:54] <Vicrry> Stats, no thanks.
[7:54] <Gunmage> lol
[7:54] <EmpiresBane> sorre, that's not an option. minecraft is his income
[7:54] <darkedone02> it be nice if minecraft has stats but does not limit you to mine and do things.... use it for personal achievements and perks
[7:54] <tfaal> Sorre: If the effects are subtle enough, and take long enough to pile on, it won't be practical to grind.
[7:54] <Gunmage> runescape will steal the minecraft engine
[7:54] <Dude000> people will still grind it
[7:54] <sorre> people will grind anyway
[7:54] <Gunmage> Turn it into runecraft
[7:54] <tfaal> EmpiresBane: I think he MIGHT have been joking.
[7:54] <darkedone02> like I have a low mine level stat but I can still mine gold and diamonds...
[7:54] <EmpiresBane> nope
[7:54] <Vicrry> Item modifiers? Maybe. We'll see how the proposal is written.
[7:55] <Gunmage> ugh not mining stats
[7:55] <Gunmage> This will be like 3d runescape
[7:55] <Gunmage> Except actually worth playing
[7:55] * Krnau- (moi@dsl-olubrasgw1-fe42fb00-185.dhcp.inet.fi) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[7:55] <Dude000> fantastic
[7:55] <sorre> just, seriously, this whole stat thing is the slipperiest of slopes
[7:55] <darkedone02> so what if people grind away, yall people grind stone for cobblestone and build great things... If minecraft have stats, you achieve a very high level anyways...
[7:55] <EmpiresBane> fucking valve... STOP UPDATING YOUR GAMES!!!
[7:55] <Vicrry> lolz EmpiresBane
[7:55] <Dragoon> I wish there was an easier way to find iron, or make fire.
[7:56] <Dude000> what updated now
[7:56] <darkedone02> enjoy your bugs then epiresbane
[7:56] <liq3> Dragoon: iron is easy to find.
[7:56] <tfaal> sorre: That doesn't make sense. Slippery slopes happen when whole communities have decision making power. Here, it's one dude in Sweden.
[7:56] <Gunmage> did valve do the engy update yet?
[7:56] <liq3> Fire is easy once you find some flint.
[7:56] <EmpiresBane> darkedone02, i don't have any problems. it's all the fucking mac support
[7:56] <Dragoon> I have flint, just no iron
[7:56] <Gunmage> I need some flint
[7:56] <Gunmage> And have iron
[7:56] <Shadox> hey, can you find diamonds on floating?
[7:56] <Gunmage> >_>
[7:56] <Dragoon> I've been looking since I started
[7:56] <Gunmage> I dont think so
[7:56] <tfaal> Gunmage: Dig through gravel
[7:56] <darkedone02> EmpiresBane: so your another mac hater? PC jerk :P
[7:56] <Gunmage> What is gravel
[7:57] <Gunmage> Is it that stuff near water
[7:57] <Shadox> O.o
[7:57] <Obtuse_goose> yes
[7:57] <Gunmage> red/brownish?
[7:57] <SireTRM> Yes.
[7:57] <liq3> Dragoon: dig a channel, about 20 long and 1 wide, straight down.
[7:57] <Gunmage> Ah, alright
[7:57] <liq3> 100% you'll find iron.
[7:57] <Gunmage> I have yet to find any of that
[7:57] <Dude000> there's only one thing that macs have done that directly inconvenience me
[7:57] <tfaal> Gunmage: It's gray with black bits.
[7:57] <liq3> well 99% :P
[7:57] <Dude000> "put in a shitty menu for tf2"
[7:57] <Gunmage> They did
[7:57] <Gunmage> The new menu is shit
[7:57] <Obtuse_goose> nuh uh
[7:57] <Dude000> good thing there's a mod for the old menu

[7:57] <Dude000> thank heavens for the community
[7:57] <Gunmage> Yeah
[7:57] <Dude000> yes they did

[7:58] <Dude000> buttons with picture labels that barely describe what it does
[7:58] <Gunmage> ^
[7:58] <EmpiresBane> i haven't been able to see it because everytime i get on, there's MORE FUCKING UPDATES!

[7:59] <sorre> that is neither a fact, nor fun
[7:59] <Gunmage> eww dialup
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> i have dsl
[7:59] <EmpiresBane> but steam slows things down even further
[7:59] <Gunmage> I remember dialup
[7:59] <tfaal> Gunmage: Only issue is that nothing burns long enough.
[7:59] <Dude000> open steam and go to downloads
[7:59] <Dude000> scroll down to tf2
[7:59] <Dude000> how fast is it going
[7:59] <Gunmage> I thought logs burn for 5 days
[7:59] <darkedone02> EmpireBane: get a better ISP
[7:59] <Gunmage> If its slow connect to africa
[8:00] <tfaal> Gunmage: Tell that to my house. >(
[8:00] <Dude000> yeah
[8:00] <Gunmage> lol

[8:37] <tfaal> Man, some part of me misses the old "Chucking stuff into fire/lava" system of smelting.
[8:38] <tfaal> It just felt so much more self contained.
[8:38] <vurtual> So, Daggerfall has a mind boggling amount of clothing items in the game
[8:38] <vurtual> I've found multiple variations of shirts, of many classifications, in many colors, in just moments
[8:38] <sorre> it also has psychic guards
[8:38] <sorre> what's your point?
[8:38] <vurtual> vests, robes of many kinds, cloaks... thongs?
[8:39] <vurtual> I will attempt to get as many clothing items as possible.
[8:39] <Dude000> including thongs?
[8:39] <tfaal> This, in my mind, is not a worthy pursuit.

[8:39] <vurtual> Which happens to include the bizarre "red vest+red thong+red sandals" combination that makes me look like a monkey or something
[8:39] <tfaal> Actually, disregard what I just said. I spent like, five minutes playing air guitar the other day.
[8:39] <Vicrry> Be sure to not aquire said clothing legally
[8:40] <vurtual> I buy it all
[8:40] <vurtual> because one weapon=my entire clothing collection
[8:40] <vurtual> and one weapon=one body

[8:51] <Dysgalt> Japanese
[8:51] <liq3> folded?
[8:51] <Dysgalt> to make a sword

[8:52] <Dysgalt> over another thin sheet
[8:52] <Dysgalt> alot of times
[8:52] <tfaal> According to wikipedia, the most reliable source of information, they were folded "No more than sixteen times."
[8:52] <Dysgalt> The hell
[8:52] <Dysgalt> wikipedia be wrong
[8:53] <liq3> it's wikipedia dude.
[8:54] <tfaal> It's main source seems to be this book: http://books.google.com/books?id=CGZPvLkmP3IC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false

[8:55] <tfaal> Trust me, that dude must know his shit.
[8:55] <Vicrry> The magic wasn't necessarily the folding - it just mechanically drove out the carbon and turned iron into steel. The heat treament was also beautiful, but that's later. If you have a steel sword and everyone else has a questionable iron one, you winned.

[10:08] <Tux> DICKFAEC
[10:08] <LG_Legacy> Hey
[10:08] <wry> sleep isn't required
[10:08] <vurtual> and the whole point of the game would be to survive. Maybe you'd just make run a store in the simulated economy, or adventure, or inhumanly build a wonderous fortress.
[10:09] <vurtual> with a big, generated landscape and generated towns and expected structures

[10:12] <Gunmage> l4d2 isn't really a survival game.
[10:12] <Visiiri> My right testicle > My left testicle
[10:12] <vurtual> ye olde kingdomes, then some sort of barren landscape land in the middle of everything, tropical islands, and then far-east stuff in the... far east.
[10:12] <Visiiri> Gunmage: Play on Survival :|
[10:12] <Gunmage> Oh jesus christ
[10:13] <Gunmage> Not talking about that
[10:13] <Gunmage> A realistic scenario
[10:13] <Gunmage> And with slow zombs, and no special infected.
[10:13] <Willerin> Minecraft cant exactly be realistic
[10:13] <vurtual> the biggest survival experience L4D2 gave me was the SI-only zombie singleplayer mode
[10:13] <Gunmage> Im not talking about minecraft
[10:14] <Willerin> also you can change the speed and turn off Special Infected in L4D2
[10:14] <vurtual> because resources were a problem, or rapidly found in places
[10:14] <vurtual> and there was danger
[10:14] <vurtual> left 4 dead console messarounds let me build a cool fort though
[10:14] <Gunmage> Oh god the si mutation was kinda fun
[10:14] <Visiiri> Not really...
[10:14] <Willerin> I wish they kept that in like Survival Versus
[10:14] <Gunmage> Until I was raped by a witch, boomer, and tank simultaneiously
[10:14] <Visiiri> It's far too easy to go down in that case.
[10:14] <Visiiri> Willerin: There was no Survival Versus.
[10:14] <Gunmage> Just run it
[10:15] <vurtual> not really it was actually a challleeenge
[10:15] <Willerin> Er, I mean, Realism Versus
[10:15] <Gunmage> I just ran through it all
[10:15] <Visiiri> They DID keep it
[10:15] <Gunmage> Saw a witch? Ran past
[10:15] <Visiiri> D:
[10:15] <vurtual> anyways I hope Notch does something like earlier for minecraft
[10:15] <Gunmage> Tank? Ran
[10:15] <vurtual> singleplayer infdev survival... on a story-filled landscape
[10:15] <Gunmage> Smoker? ......
[10:15] <Willerin> yeah they kept Realism versus in but not last man on earth
[10:15] <Visiiri> Nope
[10:15] <vurtual> with creepy dungeons of DOS-era meshes
[10:15] <Visiiri> D: Or the gnome mode
[10:15] <Gunmage> lol
[10:16] <Visiiri> That one sucked because the gnome kept falling through the ground D:
[10:16] <Gunmage> I wish minecraft had day zombies
[10:16] <Gunmage> Oh god the achievement for the gnome was annoying
[10:16] <Visiiri> It wasn't hard at all, however.
[10:16] <Gunmage> My friend punted it out of the helicopter at the last moment
[10:16] <Gunmage> Yeah
[10:16] <Gunmage> I had to do it again though
[10:16] <Visiiri> I actually got it for the first time in Realism Versus
[10:17] <Gunmage> lol
[10:17] <Visiiri> Slow progress is slow
[10:17] <Gunmage> I just ran through the levels with a friend
[10:17] <Visiiri> See a SI -> Drop Gnome -> Stop moving -> Kill SI -> Gather selves up -> Grab gnome -> Move again
[10:17] <Gunmage> He did constant adrenaline, I just ran
[10:18] <Gunmage> It was funny, I threw the gnome at a boomer just as my friend shot him, and it went FLYING
[10:18] <Visiiri> Ahh
[10:18] <Visiiri> Gnome = can be used as a weapon
[10:19] <Visiiri> that happened to us at one point and the gnome crowned the witch

[10:26] <Gunmage> lol
[10:26] <vede> Willerin, tomorrow.
[10:26] <Gunmage> Also, I realize the proper term is not black
[10:26] <vede> Like Notch said.
[10:26] <Gunmage> It is easier to say black.
[10:26] <Gunmage> Like it is easier to say White
[10:26] <Gunmage> Instead of Caucasian
[10:26] <vede> The proper term is whatever the fuck you want to say.

[10:39] <liq3> ;P
[10:39] <Gunmage> a 3x3 cube of evenly spaced trees
[10:39] <Gunmage> With trees on top of those trees
[10:39] <vede> liq3, which is why I specified "among 'western' countries"
[10:39] <liq3> Australia and the US are pretty darn similar...
[10:40] <liq3> :p
[10:40] <furrot> except for game launch dates
[10:40] <Vispiiri> Culture wise, I suppose
[10:40] <Gunmage> Know what, here, ill get a screenie
[10:40] <vede> Like moving from Australia to the 'States, or from the 'States to Canada or something.
[10:40] <Vispiiri> Except for the 'graphic contet'
[10:40] <vede> Holy shit.
[10:40] <Vispiiri> I've been to canada
[10:40] <vede> Visiiri, did the whole seasons being reversed thing fuck you up at all?
[10:40] <Gunmage> holy shit what
[10:40] <Gunmage> oh
[10:40] <Vispiiri> vede: Big time
[10:41] <Vispiiri> I used to always go snowboarding for my birthday.
[10:41] <Vispiiri> We'd go south to a mountain that I can't recall it's name now
[10:41] <furrot> my friend just moved to australia from montreal
[10:41] <furrot> must be crazy
[10:41] <liq3> lol @ this comic. http://www.out-at-home.com/archives/1180
[10:41] <vede> Dude, that sort of change would just blow my mind.
[10:41] <Vispiiri> Only around holidays.
[10:41] <Vispiiri> Summer break is still summber break
[10:41] <liq3> Vispiiri: Lol... Go to the beach for your birthday now? :P
[10:41] <Vispiiri> Dates are the same
[10:42] <Vispiiri> liq3 Idaho has no beaches :(
[10:42] <Vispiiri> I actually REALLY miss beaches.
[10:42] <Vispiiri> I lived right on the water in Sydney
[10:42] <liq3> uh
[10:42] <furrot> neither will the whole south coast soon :S
[10:42] * liq3 is confused.
[10:42] <Vispiiri> We have like one resivoir, then a lake two hours north
[10:42] <Vispiiri> D:
[10:42] <liq3> Vispiiri: which country did you move to from which other country? :P
[10:42] <vede> I'd imagine there'd be a massive difference in general theme around holidays between hemispheres.
[10:42] <Gunmage> We dont have dingos
[10:42] <Vispiiri> I moved from Australia to Idaho
[10:43] <Gunmage> Oh yeah
[10:43] <liq3> ah
[10:43] <liq3> ok
[10:43] <Gunmage> In nebraska (here)
[10:43] <liq3> born in Aussie?
[10:43] <Vispiiri> vede: Only the ones that depend on weather.
[10:43] <Gunmage> Its like christmas on halloween
[10:43] <vede> I mean, Winter holidays in the northern hemisphere are all about snow and cold things.
[10:43] <vede> But...
[10:43] <Vispiiri> I mean, Santa doesn't wear a big coat
[10:43] <Gunmage> It snows that early in the year
[10:43] <liq3> There's holidays that DON'T depend on weather?
[10:43] <Vispiiri> (He isn't even that significant where I grew up..)
[10:43] <Vispiiri> liq3: I mean in celebration and customs
[10:43] <Gunmage> http://i158.photobucket.com/albums/t120/logan5221/trees.jpg
[10:43] <Vispiiri> Here, christmas = white
[10:43] <Gunmage> I win at game yet?
[10:43] <liq3> Haha.
[10:43] <Vispiiri> Cold, snow
[10:43] <Vispiiri> There.. not so much.
[10:43] <liq3> I just realised, Santa's clothing would make NO sense in the southern hemisphere.
[10:44] <furrot> hehe neat tree
[10:44] <Vispiiri> No sense, but in alot of cases it's not changed.
[10:44] <Gunmage> Im trying to make the world tree
[10:44] <Vispiiri> Souther california and hawaii have the same santa
[10:44] <furrot> I'm sure coca cola can et him up with a new outfit
[10:44] <Vispiiri> Cultural diffusion, good sir
[10:44] <Gunmage> Because im wondering if trees will go high above the cloud line
[10:44] <liq3> lol I know... they still have Santa's in big red coats having kids sit on their knee in shopping malls in Australia...
[10:44] <vede> Halloween here has the huge orange and brown theme because that's when all the trees are changing color and dying and such, but in the southern hemisphere Halloween would be when everything is springing back to life after Winter.
[10:44] <Gunmage> Do trees grow above the block limit?

[10:47] <liq3> PRETEND I NEVER SAID HIP.
[10:47] <Gunmage> Greece is dying in debt

[10:49] <liq3> All owed to the Federal Bank.

[10:50] <liq3> it doesn't seem legit.

[10:51] <furrot> that page has a million flashblocked elements on it
[10:51] <Gunmage> Believe it or not, but we do profit
[10:51] <liq3> it also says 54 trillion in debt.
[10:51] <Gunmage> Says 13 here
[10:51] <Gunmage> Yup, its in the 13's
[10:52] <liq3> oh
[10:52] <liq3> i see
[10:52] <furrot> only thing that would clear that up would be a meteor strike
[10:52] <Gunmage> I wish we would just nuke china and north korea and be done with it

[10:52] <liq3> fuck.
[10:52] <furrot> if you paid them their 43k would the leave you alone?

[10:53] <TerryRollings> Hm, are there no natural underground chambers in infdev?
[10:53] <Gunmage> Hey china, I paid 50k to our government who paid it to you, so, dont shoot me.

[10:54] <Shadaez> AndrewPH wat
[10:54] <Gunmage> but can it outsmart boolet?
[10:54] <sorre> i just looked at the picture of the dynamic water
[10:54] <sorre> and i noticed something i didn't before
[10:54] <Gunmage> what
[10:54] <sorre> the water being fractions of blocks high
[10:54] <furrot> yeah
[10:54] <Gunmage> yeah
[10:54] <sorre> i did not notice this the first time
[10:54] <furrot> probably 8 levels
[10:54] <Gunmage> someone said something about different water block heights
[10:55] <sorre> i'm now much more excited
[10:55] <Gunmage> like 1/8, etc
[10:55] <Owtch> I wonder if waterfalls will ever be possible
[10:55] <Gunmage> We think so
[10:55] <furrot> it's in the screenshot so probably
[10:55] <Shadaez> I believe it's 1 level per pixel on the texture, what's minecrafts texture resolution?
[10:55] <TerryRollings> Where is that picture Sorre?
[10:55] * Scrippy (Mibbit@pool-96-241-118-18.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[10:55] <Gunmage> It will probably be affected by gravity
[10:55] <sorre> http://notch.tumblr.com/
[10:55] <furrot> 16x16
[10:55] <Gunmage> And not just spread out like a self replicating machine
[10:55] <TerryRollings> Oh, cool.
[10:55] <DDRJake> notch hacks bad
[10:56] <sorre> i sorta wish he'd make higher-res screenshots
[10:56] <Gunmage> It will probably be based on how much water there is on the map
[10:56] <sorre> so it'd be easier to see
[10:56] <furrot> he said it's based on the light from torches, not some crazy Dwarf fortressy system
[10:56] <Gunmage> So you cant flood an entire map by climbing up high and letting loose
[10:56] <Shadaez> it makes sense
[10:56] <Gunmage> Maybe waves?

[10:56] <sorre> waves... waves would be incredible
[10:56] <furrot> programming fluids in roguelikes is a huge performance pain
[10:56] <vede> Shadaez, it's not one level per texel.
[10:56] <Gunmage> It would be possible
[10:56] <TerryRollings> I'd love to be able to somehow carry water, but dont know how it'd be implemented.
[10:56] <sorre> tides
[10:56] <vede> It's one level per two texels.
[10:57] <furrot> buckets :)
[10:57] <Gunmage> Yeah
[10:57] <DDRJake> bucket!
[10:57] <Gunmage> Someone suggested buckets
[10:57] <TerryRollings> Yeah, buckets would make sense
[10:57] <Shadaez> You have the source of water, which is 16/16 and it goes out 16 blocks all around it all the wya to 1/16th, then they all start to rise 1//16th
[10:57] <sorre> buckets + infinite water = trollface.tiff
[10:57] <vede> Shadaez, it doesn't have 1/16
[10:57] <TerryRollings> lol
[10:57] <furrot> if it's a level per 2 pixels then 8 levels would make sense, that's how much room there is in the file format
[10:57] <vede> It's not x/16
[10:57] <Gunmage> lol
[10:57] <Shadaez> whatever, 1/8th
[10:57] <vede> It's x/8
[10:57] <Gunmage> You can use cheat engine to hack the block type to water
[10:57] <Gunmage> Doesnt work in MP
[10:58] <Gunmage> But is funny in singleplayer
[10:58] <furrot> i don't think it's going to track how much water has left the source

[10:58] <Scrippy> What I'm wondering is
[10:58] <Shadaez> my explanation makes sense
[10:58] <Gunmage> This is awesome
[10:58] <Scrippy> If you drop water onto a flat plain
[10:58] <Gunmage> Will lava work in the same way?
[10:59] <Scrippy> Completely flat
[10:59] <Scrippy> What happen?
[10:59] <liq3> Gunmage: hopefully.
[10:59] <Gunmage> It stays in place
[10:59] <Gunmage> If I had to guess
[10:59] <Scrippy> Augh what.
[10:59] <furrot> nah that wouldn't make sense
[10:59] <Gunmage> Depending on how high?
[10:59] <Scrippy> Wouldn't it spread out until it was a series of 1/8 layers
[10:59] <Scrippy> And then dissapear?
[10:59] <Gunmage> Or that
[10:59] <Scrippy> Depending on stone/grass/etc
[10:59] <liq3> Scrippy: logically it'd spread out, and then 1/8 would evaporate.
[10:59] <Gunmage> Alright, im going to bed, its a minute from being 1 here
[11:00] <DDRJake> 8am here!
[11:00] <Gunmage> But if there was evaporation
[11:00] <furrot> 3am!
[11:00] <Gunmage> Wouldnt all water dissapear eventually?
[11:00] <Scrippy> So how does the ocean work?
[11:00] * TkTech|WhoWasIKidding is now known as Tkech
[11:00] * Gunmage ponders if there will be a weather system

[11:00] <furrot> it will probably only evaporate at 1/8 or 2/8
[11:00] <liq3> which is DF style.
[11:00] <liq3> :P
[11:00] <Scrippy> Is it a huge water sink/source, and a constant?
[11:00] <TrueWolves> if there is evaporation, there is /also/ rain
[11:00] <TrueWolves> duh
[11:00] <Scrippy> Ohgod
[11:00] <liq3> not true!
[11:00] <Scrippy> I wonder how rain will work now.

[11:01] <TerryRollings> I love having new features that force you to think about structural designs more.
[11:01] <furrot> hard to dig more then a feet feet down without it flooding

[11:03] <Visiiri> It'd be cool if 1/16 water formed on the ground in the rain

[11:04] <liq3> pics not very high res tho so it's hard to tell.
[11:04] <Visiiri> It shows eight levels

[11:05] <furrot> hehe, twitter has been down all night, I don't know why people like that crap
[11:05] <Scrippy> With his new save style thing
[11:05] <Roadcrosser> yawn
[11:05] <liq3> yes it's almost certainly 8ths.
[11:05] <liq3> or 7ths.
[11:05] <furrot> it's like the worlds worst comment thread
[11:05] <liq3> actually 7ths is probably more likely.
[11:05] <liq3> ...wait
[11:05] <Scrippy> Will he be able to raise the build ceiling?
[11:05] <liq3> nvm 8ths.
[11:05] <liq3> Scrippy: there's lighting issues stopping that afiak.
[11:05] <Visiiri> M, perhaps
[11:05] <Visiiri> doesn't really matter
[11:05] <Visiiri> the point is the same
[11:06] <Shadaez> it is 8ths
[11:06] <Shadaez> ic an see 2 pixels on the sand for each level
[11:06] <furrot> looks like eights to me just based off of the 2 pixel tall thing
[11:06] <Scrippy> Hmm
[11:06] <Shadaez> and textures are 16^2
[11:06] <Shadaez> so 16/2 = 8
[11:06] <Visiiri> k
[11:06] <Scrippy> My favourite thing about minecraft

[11:09] <liq3> :P
[11:09] <furrot> as a former resident, niagara falls is overrated
[11:09] <TerryRollings> Can doors be resized, do you know?
[11:09] <sorre> no, i need niagara falls
[11:09] <liq3> lol niagara.
[11:09] <sorre> otherwise, i can't slowly turn whenever someone mentions it
[11:10] <Scrippy> What are you talking about Shadaez?
[11:10] <Shadaez> I'd have to convert it to MP3
[11:11] <Scrippy> Also I am definitely draining part of the ocean into hell.
[11:11] <furrot> I've boated to the coast guard border at horseshoe falls, I'd imagine I would have shit a brick if the engine stalled

[11:11] <Scrippy> What, do you download them in FLAC or something?
[11:11] <Shadaez> ...
[11:12] <Scrippy> I still have no idea what you're talking about.
[11:12] <Visiiri> I love dirty hawt buttsecks
[11:12] <Visiiri> whoops
[11:12] <Visiiri> wrong channel
[11:12] <Shadaez> chiptunes generally come in .xm or another format, which is tiny, I'd have to convert it to MP3, which is significantly larger
[11:12] <Visiiri> Disreguard that.
[11:12] <furrot> http://www.rmichelson.com/Artist_Pages/Masla/Images/Horseshoe-Falls.jpg
[11:12] <Visiiri> Shadaez is right. That would GREATLY reduce the quality aswell.
[11:13] <sorre> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yJBhzMWJCc
[11:13] <Visiiri> (Listening to RAMMSTEIN.)
[11:13] <Scrippy> I get the majority of mine in .mp3 =\
[11:13] <Shadaez> chiptune files are tiny because they just tell the pc what sounds to play, I think, if you convert it to mp3 it would be a recording of the sound
[11:14] <Shadaez> that's how I think of it in my head, at least
[11:14] <Scrippy> Aah, now I get it.
[11:14] <Scrippy> Raw chiptunes.
[11:14] <sorre> you want a portable that can play raw chiptunes?
[11:14] <sorre> get a game boy
[11:14] <Shadaez> lol
[11:14] <Scrippy> I get most of mine in 256 kbps and up.
[11:14] <Scrippy> So they do take up a lot of space.
[11:14] <liq3> furrot: what game?
[11:15] <Shadaez> 90% of my music is 320 kbs
[11:15] <Scrippy> No huge loss in audio quality though.

[11:15] <Scrippy> I have no problem with 256.
[11:15] <Visiiri> I got a GBP emulator for my iPod Touch
[11:15] <Visiiri> Epic, right?
[11:15] <Shadaez> the rest is V0 variable bit rate
[11:15] <Scrippy> 192 is eeh.
[11:15] <furrot> liq3 Canada, irl http://relaxitsjustablog.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/niagara-falls-horseshoe-falls.jpg
[11:15] <Visiiri> I actually DO listen to chiptunes on it.
[11:15] <Scrippy> at 128 snare drums sound like my ears popping.
[11:15] <Visiiri> (However, eww.)
[11:16] <Visiiri> You've got a pusseh! I have a dick-ah! So what's the problem! Let's do it quick! Take me now before it's too late, life's too short so I can't wait, take me now oh don't you see? I can't get laid in gerrrrmannnnnnyyyyy!
[11:16] <Shadaez> well, 320 works for me, I've only used 10 gigs of 27ish ("30") on my ipod
[11:17] <Visiiri> K, CS:S time
[11:17] <furrot> people still play that ;)
[11:17] <Scrippy> I don't even have an Ipod.
[11:17] <Scrippy> Wish I did.
[11:18] <furrot> there's an app for that
[11:18] <Scrippy> Or an iPhone
[11:18] <Scrippy> Don't want one of those though.
[11:18] * Shadaez is considering using rockbox on his ipod
[11:18] <Scrippy> Droid man.
[11:18] <furrot> you could proably get a cheap used iphone by the end of the month
[11:18] <Shadaez> I'd love an Android slate device.
[11:19] <Visiiri> It's sad
[11:19] <Shadaez> I don't even want a phone anymore, an android device + skype + google voice would be perfect. I'm rarely anywhere that doesn't have wifi
[11:19] <Visiiri> free ipod headphones have a better mic than my $60 headset
[11:19] * Tkech is now known as TkTech|Sleep
[11:19] <Scrippy> That's what I want too.
[11:19] <Scrippy> Preferrably a smallish tablet PC.
[11:20] <Scrippy> With a bluetooth headset and a lazer wifi keyboard.
[11:20] <Shadaez> there's an iPad clone that's a droid, for around 200
[11:20] <Shadaez> an android*
[11:20] <Scrippy> Yeah, I saw that one.
[11:20] <furrot> i can't imagine a real clone feeling as sturdy, you could beat someone to death with an ipad, slowly
[11:21] <Shadaez> I really want an android device
[11:21] <Shadaez> I'd end up making apps for it
[11:22] <furrot> if microsoft made a c sharp compiler for the iphone I would be happy :D
[11:23] <Shadaez> I don't think they'd do that
[11:23] <furrot> so used to using visual studio since I have to use it at work
[11:23] <furrot> actually I think I read they are paying iphone devs to port to win mobile
[11:23] <Shadaez> you have to compile apps for iphones on a mac, so they'd be making a mac-only app that's using Mono
[11:24] <furrot> <- on a mac, with a full iphone dev license :)
[11:24] <TrueWolves> There are 3 things I'm greatly surprised about in the latest blog post.
[11:24] <TrueWolves> Anyone want to guess them?
[11:24] <furrot> water?
[11:24] <Shadaez> UHHH
[11:24] <furrot> water levels
[11:24] <furrot> and waterfalls?
[11:24] <TerryRollings> Breaking down of block sizes?
[11:25] <TrueWolves> 1 of them is the fact that it's relating to water, Notch said that's one of the hardest things for him to code
[11:25] <Shadaez> 999 blocks?
[11:25] <TrueWolves> the other is the block sizes, Notch hates half blocks
[11:25] <Scrippy> These are like 8th blocks.
[11:25] <TrueWolves> Which are technicaly half half half blocks
[11:25] <Shadaez> it's completely different though
[11:25] <furrot> hehe
[11:25] <TrueWolves> anyone got the third?
[11:25] <TerryRollings> Aye, but at least they are only liquid and gas related, not building block related.
[11:25] <furrot> the term we used in canada is "half-quarter"
[11:25] <sorre> >my face when today's update has dynamic water AND caves
[11:25] <Shadaez> he says when he's releasing it?
[11:25] <TrueWolves> half-quarter, I think that.
[11:25] <TrueWolves> CORRECT
[11:26] <TrueWolves> He gave a date of release
[11:26] <Shadaez> yay
[11:26] <TrueWolves> ... wow
[11:26] <Scrippy> I think he might be giving into pressures of "easy" over "Way he think it ought to be done"
[11:26] * TrueWolves is impressed!
[11:26] <Scrippy> It'll probably be something along the lines of valvetime to be completely honest.
[11:26] <furrot> very easily apparently
[11:26] <liq3> Scrippy: people were suggesting the current method?
[11:27] <Shadaez> basing it on torches was genius
[11:27] <TrueWolves> Here is your rewards for impressing me...
[11:27] * TrueWolves sets mode +v furrot
[11:27] * TrueWolves sets mode +v TerryRollings
[11:27] * TrueWolves sets mode +v Shadaez
[11:27] <TrueWolves> Those are all temporary
[11:27] <Shadaez> awesome
[11:27] <TrueWolves> I will not replace them if lost.
[11:27] <Shadaez> how 2 lose?
[11:27] <furrot> well he said on twitter his original method of standing vs moving didn't work that well
[11:27] <TrueWolves> when you leave the room they go away.
[11:27] <Shadaez> :(
[11:27] <furrot> voice?
[11:28] <TrueWolves> I have to have a real reason to give away a permenet voice.
[11:28] <TrueWolves> XD
[11:28] <furrot> this reward is both short and confusing :P
[11:28] <TrueWolves> It's purely cosmetic, and better then nothing at all
[11:28] <Shadaez> i'm now the 7th person on the list
[11:29] <TrueWolves> I'd offer you all 500 smooth stone but there is no trading yet.
[11:29] <furrot> oh I see the little speakery thing now
[11:29] <Shadaez> lol you're on mibbit
[11:29] <Shadaez> you're going to lose it fast
[11:29] <furrot> yeah like 10 minutes when I go to sleep :P
[11:30] <TrueWolves> Sorry. XD
[11:30] <Shadaez> good thing I recently restarted
[11:30] <furrot> never found an irc client I liked
[11:30] <furrot> this works good enough

[11:37] <Shadaez> prestige*?
[11:38] <furrot> maybe i'll leave it open then... I do like to be important
[11:38] <Rithiur> furrot: Technically, voice means that you can speak if the channel has +m mode on. Often, voice is just use as means to give recognition in a channel.

[13:37] <Cyrex> not those pansy ones we have currently

[13:39] <Cyrex> I want a match on a long stick though
[13:39] <Visiiri> That means that we just need black sand.

[14:29] <Kodaichi> took his blocks, sliced em up into little pieces
[14:29] <Quatroking> mainly books but they do software too
[14:29] <ZaxKellens> And you can buy good stuff for really cheap by accident?

[14:59] <ZaxKellens> I mean, nothing
[14:59] <liq3> LOL
[14:59] <liq3> 99 cents...
[14:59] <Quatroking> Yeah.
[15:00] <Quatroking> The store probably got hacked or something
[15:00] <Quatroking> or they just have some retards working there
[15:00] <Quatroking> there we go, received the confirmation of my order
[15:01] <liq3> too bad actual people probably package it... someone may notice the price. :/
[15:01] <liq3> and maybe cancel it.

[15:02] <ZaxKellens> It should
[15:02] <ZaxKellens> I dunno Belgium law, but most laws say if you misprint price, too bad
[15:02] <Xybjj> Hi. Do I have to register my nickname here?
[15:02] <ZaxKellens> Especially if you already gave the money for it
[15:02] <Quatroking> I totally thought the pricing was serious so they can't blame me either

[15:13] <Broand> Also, If anyone has the time or the cooking skills to do so...
[15:14] <Broand> Onigiri with battered cod filling.
[15:14] <Broand> I have no idea what it's like but it sounds awesome
[15:14] <ZaxKellens> Gross
[15:14] <Quatroking> sounds good
[15:15] <ZaxKellens> Hnnn
[15:15] <Serow> Onigiri filled with orange chicken. Delish.

[15:16] <vede> It's kinda funny to see how many people in the community are trying to claim the idea of multi-level water.
[15:17] <ZaxKellens> Want pocky...
[15:17] <ZaxKellens> I don't care about claiming shit, I just like that it's being done
[15:17] <ZaxKellens> If Notch uses one of my ideas, great, I don't care about claiming it, I'll just be happy that it's being done
[15:17] <vede> "I suggest this omg I <3 NOOOOOTCH" "Oh wow. I suggested this and it was implemented." "My idea! He's doing it! Wow!"
[15:17] <Serow> Notch has been talking about multi-level water forever. :o If anything, blame Dwarf Fortress. XD
[15:18] <vede> Serow, my thoughts exactly.
[15:18] <Quatroking> vede: i pretty much pulled Notch into the fantasy steampunk theme
[15:18] <Serow> I just hope we get buckets along with the water. XD
[15:18] <Broand> I don't really care.
[15:18] <ZaxKellens> Is the water implemented yet?
[15:18] <vede> No.
[15:19] <ZaxKellens> Dammit
[15:19] <ZaxKellens> It'd be kinda cool if the water level went up and down, like tides
[15:20] <cynicalAlchemist> Patience, we will get soon enough.

[15:20] <cynicalAlchemist> I actually don't think it will be.
[15:21] <Serow> Infinite water doesn't really have a need for height differences... But I do think the ocean should be an infinite water source.
[15:21] <ZaxKellens> Nevah
[15:21] <ZaxKellens> Oceans aren't infinite in real life
[15:21] <Rens2Sea> Quatroking, did the Azur order work?
[15:22] <Jackomel> but the water is so much it doesn't matter
[15:22] <Xybjj> They technically aren't infinite, but let's face it, how can you dig a big enough hole to drain the oceans?

[16:22] <Speljohan_> catchy as fuck
[16:22] <Snowman> And if you are thinking of Alienware, don't ALienware = Dell
[16:22] <sppt> Speljohan_, just that song or the whole album?
[16:22] <Speljohan_> whole album is good, but in particular that song :P

[16:23] <bildramer> this has become a classic

[16:23] <Speljohan_> alienware is overpriced shit
[16:23] <Ominus> because im gonna buy it in germany where my dad works so no shipping cost plus i'll take it through my dad who gets discounts from dell cuz hes in ADAC

[16:23] <bildramer> anti sound? wat
[16:24] <Snowman> Never heard it?
[16:24] <Speljohan_> retail pc's are fine unless you want one for gaming
[16:24] <Speljohan_> because then it's just overpriced
[16:24] <bildramer> If you mean the waveform that would cancel the sound
[16:24] <bildramer> then
[16:24] <bildramer> hahahahahahahahahaha
[16:24] <bildramer> very impossible
[16:24] <Snowman> If you put sound at the same wavelength, half a phase behind it, it levels out the sound
[16:24] <Ominus> i would build it myself but that would mean paying it all at once wich i cannot afford :(
[16:24] <bildramer> yeah
[16:24] <bildramer> for a single point
[16:24] <liq3> levels out?
[16:24] <Speljohan_> <Ominus> i would build it myself but that would mean paying it all at once wich i cannot afford :(
[16:24] <bildramer> if you move, perhaps it doubles it
[16:24] <Snowman> Yeah
[16:24] <Speljohan_> huh?
[16:24] <Speljohan_> buy parts separately
[16:24] <Vicrry> destructive interference works
[16:24] <bildramer> depends on the listener's position
[16:24] <Snowman> Sound is like a sin
[16:24] <Speljohan_> a few at a time
[16:24] <bildramer> sound isn't instant
[16:24] <Speljohan_> that's what i did with my first pc

[16:25] <bildramer> change what to a flat line?
[16:25] <Xybjj> 40 months installment?
[16:25] <Vicrry> and I rarely buy a whole pc
[16:25] <Speljohan_> i hate buying stuff on a split-payment
[16:25] <Snowman> It's all just interference
[16:25] <Ominus> my current comp is way too old to upgrade xD
[16:26] <Speljohan_> at most i'd have a 2 time payment plan
[16:26] <liq3> Snowman: has this been done before? :p
[16:26] <bildramer> Shifting phase by 180 deg would only remove more than 0% of the wave in only half of the stadium
[16:26] <Speljohan_> never ever more than that
[16:26] <Snowman> liq3, well, not on a scale that big
[16:26] <Speljohan_> generally paying upfront is best
[16:26] <Snowman> But cancelling out sound, yeah
[16:26] <bildramer> it's not impossible
[16:26] <Azathoth> argh. has anyone here played rainbow six vegas 2?
[16:26] <bildramer> you would have to sit in weird patterns

[16:26] <Azathoth> this game is making me feel retarded
[16:26] <Speljohan_> although, for this pc i spent a total of like $2.5k under 3 months
[16:26] <Xybjj> Sound cancelling only works on noise that is consistent, doesn't it?
[16:26] <Speljohan_> for separate parts
[16:27] <Speljohan_> would have costed like $1.8k max if i wasn't so picky
[16:27] <bildramer> over TV you could do that of course
[16:27] <Speljohan_> it was like

[16:29] <bildramer> interesting
[16:29] <Azathoth> i want the voice commands to work
[16:29] <Snowman> My previous computer had a GeForce 5200
[16:29] <Superwafflez> they just dont work lol
[16:29] <Speljohan_> my previous had a geforce 3
[16:29] <Azathoth> they were actually decent in r63. i don't understand why they've gotten shittier
[16:29] <Snowman> Or something in the 5k series at least
[16:29] <Superwafflez> voice commands in general are shitty
[16:29] <Snowman> Could be 5400
[16:30] <Speljohan_> 64mb, it was leet!
[16:30] <Superwafflez> I had a 6600GT last gen
[16:30] <Azathoth> i actually used them effectively in r63 though. and that was years ago. how the hell has it gotten worse?

[17:06] <Xybjj> I use gametrailers, gamespot didn't work for me yesterday
[17:07] <Shrub> Because the game hates you Vicrry

[17:08] <Shrub> haha
[17:09] <vede> ZaxKellens, you can shut up about Notch and waking up now.

[17:10] <Shrub> so I have to make enormous towers

[17:31] <Ominus> lava should flow at light speed

[17:32] <Ominus> so you only have a split second to seal the hole

[17:32] <cynicalAlchemist> Yeah, I'm pretty sure physics don't work like that.
[17:32] <Ominus> xD
[17:32] <Xybjj> Lava is pretty slow.
[17:32] <Ominus> it uses alien physics!
[17:33] <Takos360> :D
[17:33] <Xybjj> In a pyroclastic flow, the lava can travel up to 450mph
[17:33] <Takos360> Would be cool if lava would bubble up if you broke a hole above it
[17:33] <Ominus> lava uses wormhole travel to catch and melt you
[17:33] <cynicalAlchemist> Then it wouldn't be lava. Actually it's not lava since it's underground. It's magma.
[17:33] <Xybjj> Well, it's not actually lava though
[17:33] <liq3> Anyone seen Volcano?
[17:33] <Kokopure> when's the water update~ <3
[17:33] <liq3> there's a bit where lava shoots like 20 foot up in the air.
[17:33] <cynicalAlchemist> *sigh*
[17:33] <liq3> ?
[17:33] <Kokopure> liq3, I've seen Volcano
[17:34] <liq3> yeh.
[17:34] <Takos360> he ment *sign*
[17:34] <Kokopure> doesn't it have Harrison Ford in it?
[17:34] <liq3> you saw that bit? P:
[17:34] <liq3> :P
[17:34] <liq3> uh
[17:34] <Kokopure> there was a lot of lava in Volcano, liq3
[17:34] <liq3> it's the one with the volcano threatening to destroy a town.
[17:34] <Kokopure> I can't quite remember a specific scene XD
[17:34] <Kokopure> haha
[17:34] <Kokopure> "a town"?
[17:34] <liq3> right near the.
[17:34] <Kokopure> you mean San Francisco?
[17:34] <Kokopure> or Los Angeles
[17:34] <Kokopure> one of those
[17:34] <liq3> the volcano is right UNDER the town.
[17:34] <Kokopure> it was something in California
[17:34] <Kokopure> the volcano came out of the Tar Pits
[17:34] <Ominus> ah, i remember that movie lol
[17:34] <Kokopure> :3
[17:34] <Takos360> yeh
[17:34] <Takos360> ive seen that m
[17:34] <Kokopure> I do remember them making a barricade out of a bus
[17:34] <Takos360> movie! :O
[17:35] <Kokopure> and all the manholes were like PSHOO into the air
[17:35] <liq3> like, right near the end, when the magma is in the sewers, it bursts out of a sewer and flies up in the air.
[17:35] <Kokopure> and some poor city dudes got burned alive~
[17:35] <liq3> lol
[17:35] <Kokopure> at least I recall that happening
[17:35] <liq3> yeh there was one bit with a train driver.
[17:35] <Kokopure> right right
[17:35] <liq3> and he got melted by lava to save some kid or something.
[17:36] <bildramer> all I see is pretty colors

[17:38] <Ten_Tacles> UPDATE
[17:38] <Ten_Tacles> We need.

[18:28] <Koko|Minecraft> I just covered my beach with lava
[18:28] <LordQuorad> or continent
[18:28] <Bodie> i was surrounded by water
[18:28] <Ruska> how the hell do i bucket
[18:28] <Bodie> just lots of tiny islands
[18:28] <Koko|Minecraft> brb burning a forest down

[18:28] <liq3> ;O
[18:28] <Koko|Minecraft> IAI
[18:28] <Koko|Minecraft> AIA
[18:28] <liq3> water could make systems to move items down hill.
[18:28] <Koko|Minecraft> gotta smelt iron ore
[18:28] <Koko|Minecraft> aqueducts!
[18:28] <liq3> now all we need is pumps, and we can move items UP HILLS!
[18:28] <liq3> which would be AWESOME
[18:29] <Xybjj> liq3, awesome idea
[18:29] <Xybjj> someone quickly make a waterfall
[18:29] <Koko|Minecraft> hrmmm
[18:29] <Takos360> BUCKET!!!
[18:29] <Xybjj> fuelled by a large pool from using buckets of sea water
[18:29] <liq3> eveen better would be if the water filled up!
[18:29] <bildramer> holy shit I made this vsync shit
[18:29] <LordQuorad> jesus christ
[18:29] <LordQuorad> no water yet.
[18:29] <bildramer> good thing I have no epilepsy
[18:30] <Xybjj> Oh snap.
[18:30] <Xybjj> I just realized.
[18:30] <Koko|Minecraft> lava and water don't make stone
[18:30] <Xybjj> I deleted all my saves after the announcement for breaking the saves was announced
[18:30] <Koko|Minecraft> they just sit on top of each other
[18:30] <Xybjj> Perhaps that's just a glitch
[18:30] <Serow> Hm. Sandbar across an ocean... Broke down the sand bar... The water is shallower there. XD
[18:30] <gordenfreechmen> this island is cool compared to my last one

[18:31] <Takos360> now im going to make... A WATER SYSTEM!!!
[18:31] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[18:31] <Shrub> so i take it water is updated
[18:31] <LordQuorad> it's like a fucking desert
[18:31] <Ten_Tacles> Water is a "bit" quirky...
[18:31] <gordenfreechmen> lol water is inside blocks
[18:31] <Xybjj> Shrub, yes.
[18:31] <Shrub> :D
[18:31] <Hunter> Hopefully it gets updated again
[18:31] <Shrub> what does it do now?
[18:31] <gordenfreechmen> maybe thats why im getting more lag
[18:31] <Hunter> New water = etremely buggy
[18:32] <gordenfreechmen> shrub: it acts like gel
[18:32] <Shrub> how soo?

[18:32] <LordQuorad> i generated a new map and it was so large, took me 15 minutes to spot water in the distance
[18:32] <Shrub> does it act more like water and less like blue spreading air?
[18:32] <Dragoon> How does I make bukkits?
[18:32] <gordenfreechmen> you'd think itd flow infinitely when water is outside
[18:32] <tfaal> Hooray aboveground iron vein!
[18:32] <Serow> Hm... Water doesn't seem to be capable of doing something like filling a lake, unless you bucket it in.
[18:32] <Xybjj> the water is finite
[18:32] <gordenfreechmen> it kinda spills like a dense liquid
[18:32] <tfaal> Dragoon: They're like iron bowls.
[18:32] <Ten_Tacles> Meh
[18:32] <Superwafflez> ooooh fancy waterfall effect
[18:32] <Ten_Tacles> water like light
[18:32] <Ten_Tacles> Wtf
[18:32] <Shrub> The water is finite?!
[18:32] <Shrub> YES!
[18:32] <TKGP> It acts like a goo, mostly
[18:32] <Ten_Tacles> Stupid idea sorry...
[18:33] <Hunter> The water from an ocean doesn't act infinite
[18:33] <Hunter> Which sucks
[18:33] <Dragoon> Wait they're made of iron?
[18:33] <Hunter> Because you can't make rivers
[18:33] <Koko|Minecraft> haha
[18:33] <tfaal> Dragoon: Sadly yes.
[18:33] <Superwafflez> you can sort of make rivers

[18:33] <Dragoon> NOOOOOOOOOTCH
[18:33] <tfaal> Hunter: You can if they slope.
[18:33] <Serow> You can make rivers if you bucket in new springs of water...
[18:33] <Koko|Minecraft> if you remove the center infinite block of water, all the water goes away

[18:39] <furrot> am i still awesome?
[18:40] <Jackomel> it's not even flooding
[18:40] <liq3> Then pretend buckets don't exist and keep playing.
[18:40] <Visiiri> How, good sir, is it stupid?
[18:40] <gear1> lol
[18:40] <Visiiri> It simply adds more challenge
[18:40] <Mithril> does the water work well?

[18:41] <Ten_Tacles> And a river would stop halfway

[18:42] <liq3> Hrm.
[18:42] <Ten_Tacles> Exactly that.
[18:43] <liq3> I hope notch makes the ocean a "drain"
[18:43] <Superwafflez> im underground, and cant see a difference between fancy and fast, apart from framerate
[18:43] <liq3> altho i'm not sure how he's gonna do that.
[18:43] <Mithril> water doesnt fill my holes wut?
[18:43] <Ten_Tacles> They shouldn't make spring blocks but rather place blocks that moev.
[18:43] <Ten_Tacles> Not spread.
[18:43] <liq3> Superwafflez: clouds.
[18:43] <Mithril> water pushes woot
[18:43] <Visiiri> liq3: It would only take one additional block type.
[18:43] <tfaal> If you suspend disbelief a bit, and stop thinking of it as strictly infinite or finite, it works fairly well, sometimes.
[18:43] <prak> I mean the game needs work but holy fuck you have high standards for a $10 game still deep in alpha.
[18:43] <liq3> Visiiri: nono the problem is the system needs to be able to handle stuff like people walling off part of the ocean, and then attempting to drain it with buckets or something.
[18:43] <liq3> :P
[18:44] <Mithril> how to make a bucket?
[18:44] <Visiiri> Err
[18:44] <Visiiri> Whut
[18:44] <liq3> The only thing I can think of, is that water connected to the edge of the current zone is a drain/infinite...
[18:44] <gordenfreechmen> metal bowl
[18:44] <bildramer> so, update
[18:44] <liq3> It's not exactly perfect tho. :/
[18:44] <bildramer> everyine is like HOW MAKE BUCKET HURP DURP
[18:44] <bildramer> o*
[18:44] <bildramer> put in topic please
[18:44] <liq3> Visiiri: Lets say someone picks out a 10x10 area in the 'ocean'.
[18:44] <bildramer> seriously
[18:44] <bildramer> http://imgur.com/WpTWV.png
[18:44] <Visiiri> Yeah
[18:44] <bildramer> now there's an entirely new meaning to "water slide"
[18:44] <Jackomel> that makes no sense
[18:44] <liq3> They then wall it off from the rest of tho ocean.
[18:45] <prak> I like the school that is pushing for regular rain to keep water supplies up.
[18:45] <liq3> And then try to drain it with buckets.
[18:45] <liq3> :/
[18:45] <Visiiri> ...
[18:45] <Mithril> So is this hole ever gonna flood?
[18:45] <Visiiri> What's the problem with that?
[18:45] <bildramer> yay violating laws of physics
[18:45] <Mithril> water seems to be not filling the hole
[18:45] <liq3> You can't make the ocean a drain/infinite type due to that.
[18:45] * Predobear (DickNipple@dsl-217-155-16-102.zen.co.uk) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[18:45] <Visiiri> If it's not connected to a larger body of water
[18:45] <liq3> Not with just a simple block type change.
[18:45] <Visiiri> Oh, I see
[18:45] <gordenfreechmen> you can make a river
[18:45] <Visiiri> No, what I mean
[18:45] <gordenfreechmen> it just has to be huge
[18:46] <Superwafflez> should add a rule that if a block is connected to so many blocks of water it keeps flooding
[18:46] <Mithril> Its connected to the ocean
[18:46] <Visiiri> One block twenty blocks underwater, if there's x blocks in each direction
[18:46] <liq3> Only way I can think of is to check if it's connected to the edge of the zone.
[18:46] <Visiiri> that marks it as an ocean
[18:46] <Mithril> but nothing is happening
[18:46] <liq3> Which for most purposes should be fine.
[18:46] <Koko|Minecraft> haha...
[18:46] <Koko|Minecraft> I put a water on top of a tree
[18:46] <Visiiri> this block looks like water, and it acts like water, but if there's a change within two blocks, it beceomes the dynamic water again
[18:46] <liq3> Visiiri: big infinite lakes. :/
[18:46] <Koko|Minecraft> then cut down the tree
[18:46] <Koko|Minecraft> now I have a fountain
[18:46] <Koko|Minecraft> :D
[18:46] <Visiiri> otherwise, surface changes would just be filled by the presence of this block

[18:50] <LordQuorad> im scared.
[18:50] <vede> Instead of forming weird-ass water ramps on flat surfaces.

[18:53] <LordQuorad> when you're working on something
[18:53] <tfaal> One thing I like about this system is that, even in the cases of waterfalls and streams, it quickly becomes static, and thus nonlaggy.
[18:53] <LordQuorad> and a skeleton fires arrows at you from above
[18:53] <gordenfreechmen> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssssss
[18:53] <LordQuorad> scares me out of my pants
[18:53] <gordenfreechmen> skeletons are fun to fight though
[18:53] <LordQuorad> that TWANG sound you hear when he fires his bow is what makes me jump out of my seat
[18:54] <tfaal> I could never devise a winning strategry against them/

[18:54] <gordenfreechmen> i refuse to go outside if there is a spider out
[18:54] <Mithril> When I just put it somewhere everything floods

[18:56] <LordQuorad> rofl superwafflez
[18:56] <Rautapalli> 4/1?
[18:56] <Visiiri> I mean, you do a 4/1 for 80 blocks
[18:56] <Visiiri> and it will still be going from ONE spring block.
[18:56] <Visiiri> Rautapalli: Four blocks over for every one block down? Basic slope?

[19:03] <Visiiri> liq3: 4 blocks
[19:03] <liq3> nope, I did 7
[19:03] <Visiiri> Or it will deplete after a while
[19:04] <Visiiri> A long while, perhaps, but 4 blocks.
[19:04] <tfaal> So, who else likes the idea of two way rivers acting as roads?
[19:04] <Visiiri> I do!
[19:04] <Visiiri> Not possible :(
[19:04] <liq3> No I seriosuly did 7.
[19:04] <Visiiri> Hrm
[19:04] <Visiiri> I suppose
[19:04] <liq3> Got it like 3-4 layers down into the ocean.
[19:04] <Visiiri> In the blog it says that 1 block down = full block to flood
[19:04] <Visiiri> You could be right.
[19:04] <liq3> exactly. :P
[19:04] <Visiiri> (Also says 1/4 in the blog >:D)
[19:04] <liq3> it is possible...
[19:04] <Visiiri> Actually, that road system idea is great!
[19:04] <liq3> Have them seperate (the rivers)
[19:04] <LordQuorad> sand is very abundant now
[19:05] <vede> liq3, still not possible.
[19:05] <Visiiri> It'd take work, for sure, but it'd be cool
[19:05] <liq3> It was always abundant.
[19:05] <Serow> Hm. Can't put a full block over a partial block...
[19:05] <Visiiri> When you get too deep, just make a ladder up again
[19:05] <vede> Unless you wanted your roads to only be eight blocks long.
[19:05] <Visiiri> Serow: Nope
[19:05] <Drury> I wanna build awesome waterways... But I have to buy the game first :/
[19:05] <liq3> vede: assuming Notch makes them last longer then 8 blocks. :/
[19:05] <Visiiri> vede: Slope of 1/4 is 100% for sure working
[19:05] <Visiiri> liq3 claims a 7/1
[19:05] <liq3> slope of 1/7 works.
[19:06] <Visiiri> Also, I meant 4/1

[20:19] <Drury> Its boring...
[20:19] <Drury> Yes
[20:19] <Drury> I could, but its too boring
[20:19] <TerraSleet> what the
[20:19] <Dragoon> I watched the EA/Ubi conference on TV yesterday
[20:19] <TerraSleet> one tile of water turns into like 50 tiles of slightly smaller water
[20:19] <CruelNoise> i'm at school, can't watch
[20:20] <TerraSleet> which magically disappears when you delete the original tiles
[20:20] <Drury> whats the time at you?
[20:20] <CruelNoise> whome?
[20:20] <Drury> cruel
[20:20] <CruelNoise> quarter past twelve
[20:20] <CruelNoise> er, 12:15
[20:21] <gordenfreechmen> im in the same time zone but i already got out for summer
[20:21] <Drury> its 18:20 here... Im 5 mins forward... :(
[20:21] <gordenfreechmen> here im 6 min forward!
[20:22] <CruelNoise> our last day is the 29th, i think
[20:22] <Drury> so... maybe cruel is 5-6 mins backward?
[20:22] <CruelNoise> oh, yes.
[20:22] <CruelNoise> it;s probably an irregularity on the school computers
[20:22] * SireTRM goes to check infdev
[20:22] <TerraSleet> amazing
[20:23] <CruelNoise> you know, i think i'd be a lot happyer if the school ran ubuntu
[20:23] <TerraSleet> 1m3 of water turns into some 50m3 of strangely static stream water
[20:23] <CruelNoise> or even edubuntu

[20:24] <Dragoon> three silver bars in a bowl shape
[20:24] <Darke> Wooow
[20:24] <Drury> Do somethin like u with iron
[20:24] <Darke> Yeah I figured it out
[20:24] <CruelNoise> you could ask how to make a bucket
[20:24] <TerraSleet> heh
[20:24] <vede> CruelNoise, and the school wouldn't have to do virus scans every fifteen minutes as well.
[20:24] <Darke> HOLY SHIT
[20:24] <vede> Because of dumbass kids.
[20:24] <Darke> This island is huge!
[20:24] <CruelNoise> vede, so true
[20:24] <Darke> I cant see water anywhere
[20:25] <TerraSleet> also placing water on top of a mountain turns the water into a huge stream
[20:25] <TerraSleet> from 1m3 block of water
[20:25] <Drury> Yep, eurasia is huge island...
[20:25] <CruelNoise> though you can't download or install ANYTHING
[20:25] <TerraSleet> and when you delete it it magically dissipates
[20:25] <CruelNoise> i asked if we could use firefox, and they said "NOOO VIRUUUS"
[20:25] <TerraSleet> instead of?
[20:25] <CruelNoise> IE
[20:26] <TerraSleet> man what a bunch of dumbfucks
[20:26] <Darke> Haha, all I can find is a little puddle
[20:26] <SireTRM> Yup.
[20:26] <Darke> No ocean
[20:26] <CruelNoise> lul
[20:26] <Dragoon> I wish I was at E3 :L
[20:26] <CruelNoise> that would be fun
[20:26] <TerraSleet> fap over it more
[20:26] <SireTRM> Yea, being at E3 would be awesome.
[20:26] <vede> Public schools tend to have really stupid people handling their computers.
[20:26] <Darke> Actually, I think this is perfect for water
[20:27] <Dragoon> I'd be playing SW:TOR in about 4 hours.
[20:27] <Darke> Its really easy to control
[20:27] <CruelNoise> maybe i could be a part-time sysadmin and save the children
[20:27] <vede> I guess because anyone who knows a few keyboard shortcuts could amaze the hell out of any of the other school officials, so they can get the job easy.

[21:48] <Vis{Oshi}> I get over 100 fps O.o
[21:48] <ZaxKellens|Work> Good for you demmit
[21:48] <Vis{Oshi}> Marach: Shitty nets, not shitty browser.
[21:48] <Vis{Oshi}> Maybe ram
[21:48] <Vis{Oshi}> maybe compatability
[21:48] <Vis{Oshi}> but it works wonders for everyone else
[21:48] <Marach> Vis{Oshi}: i don't care
[21:48] <Vicrry> Anyway - Has someone laid out a optimal floorplan for large chests? I'd like to shove a bunch of them into an area of similar size to the startign hut
[21:48] <ZaxKellens|Work> It's worked just fine before
[21:49] <ZaxKellens|Work> Just after the clouds were changed it started slowing down again
[21:49] <Marach> i want something that works well for *me*.
[21:49] <Dragoon> Oh boy, ACII
[21:49] <Marach> so far safari does the job
[21:50] <Gunmage> I think I shall go run as far off in one direction as possible

[21:53] <Dragoon> Holy shit awesome takedown
[21:53] <Gunmage> I kind of like this water
[21:53] <Gunmage> But
[21:53] <Gunmage> I have a bridge like 40 miles in the air
[21:53] <GoaLitiuM> there should be stairblocks
[21:53] <Gunmage> And now I have a giant water tube going from the top
[21:53] <Dragoon> Bending the guy over and shooting him in the head with the hidden pistol
[21:54] <ZaxKellens|Work> Stairblocks?
[21:54] <ZaxKellens|Work> Those are called halfblocks
[21:54] <Vicrry> ACIII probably won't be very good

[21:56] <Mithril> sand is buggy atm

[23:33] <Snowman> Doesn't matter what word you use
[23:33] <x2yzh9> Faggots no. Stuck-up douches? A large majority are
[23:33] <Drewseph> heres is why the motion on move is different
[23:33] <TkTech> ZomBuster: so when creative eventually dies you can save your map

[23:34] <Quatroking> just a moment ago you were whining about consoles and now you suddenly try to insult me with shitty lines that most ten-year olds would only use.
[23:34] <ZomBuster> I could probably do that now.. but better wait for the new format
[23:34] <Quatroking> and now you run off, scared.
[23:34] <Drewseph> its hard to imagine, but on the wii, control starts from a tiny canvas and is projected onto a larger screen. that is small movments move a cursor around the screens quickly
[23:34] <Quatroking> I fucking hate this channel.
[23:34] <Malikat> bitch, shut up
[23:34] <Snowman> I fucking hate humanity
[23:34] <Malikat> if you talk about consoles
[23:34] <Azathoth> MALLLI
[23:34] <Malikat> you will turn into rage
[23:34] <AzureAngelic> how do buckets work anyway
[23:34] <Quatroking> Malikat get the fuck back into your cage
[23:34] <Malikat> so don't talk about consoles
[23:34] * Quatroking whips malikat
[23:34] <AzureAngelic> if you drop water on a flat surface does it flood everything?
[23:34] <Drewseph> with the move the canvas is from a camera, so you are starting from a huge area to movre around in, only to manipulate a cursor on a small screen
[23:34] <Snowman> AzureAngelic, right click on water
[23:34] <Azathoth> fucking buckets. how do they work?
[23:35] * Malikat mauls quatroking with a 10 year old's wit!
[23:35] <AzureAngelic> i mean does it make a finite water source
[23:35] * Quatroking gasps
[23:35] <AzureAngelic> or what
[23:35] <Azathoth> erm. it's weird azureangelic

[23:35] <Drewseph> that was not 1:1
[23:35] <Malikat> happy asian is happy
[23:35] <Azathoth> it kinda spreads out into a blob
[23:35] <TkTech> ZomBuster: make it cartographer cross platform :P
[23:35] <Drewseph> the damn club was running on a rail

[23:40] <ZomBuster> the ghost recon demo used the cloak too much
[23:40] <Dragoon> BECAUSE IT IS VALVE
[23:40] <ZomBuster> they were pretty much invis all the time
[23:40] <Azathoth> they make good games, but i'm not that interested in seeing gameplay.
[23:40] <Snowman> Cause it's motherfucking valve
[23:40] <Vicrry> Valve's has been hyped
[23:40] <sppt> i actually was sucked in by the wii
[23:40] <Drewseph> um
[23:40] <sppt> :\
[23:41] <Snowman> And because they have a "surprise"
[23:41] <SireTRM> Valve may be one of the Confidential slots
[23:41] <Drewseph> um
[23:41] <Drewseph> at least nintendo does sell out with products like coke
[23:41] <Xybjj> the PS3 is sucking me in ):
[23:41] <Xybjj> quickly, what do
[23:41] <Gunmage> valve will probably do something stupid.
[23:41] <Azathoth> true, zombuster. it seems like cloaking should be more limited :(

[23:55] <TkTech> Drewseph: a black city councillor in Toronto recommend random spot checks on black teenagers.
[23:55] <furrot> white people are... naturally bad people?
[23:55] <rbos> Kokopure: light houses need a backing on which to project light, just sticking a torch on top of a column isn't enough. What I do is build a four-sided box and put torches on each side. It doesn't have to be big.
[23:56] <TkTech> 80% of all crime in the GTA is by black gangs
[23:56] <furrot> haha i remember that
[23:56] <Gunmage> Snake is getting older and older by the millisecond
[23:56] <ZaxKellens> Forget a torch, use lava for lighthouses now
[23:56] <rbos> hah
