[0:47] <LG_Legacy> I played Ep2 for it and played the demo
[0:47] <blaster> because all those chunks you see... are heads
[0:47] <Iguana> Lul
[0:47] <Animator> I got it for free off of someone who bought it for me, which is ridiculously touching since no one's ever done something like that for me.
[0:47] <LG_Legacy> Now i'm afraid that a alien with a dong will run after me
[0:47] <Iguana> Talkin' 'bout Overture?

[0:47] <Iguana> I already had it before this.

[0:48] <Animator> I'm going to try out World of Goo first, to see how it compares with the Wii version (which I have).
[0:48] <Iguana> I played it at like 12pm at my grandma's house. It's dead silence.
[0:48] <Eagle> I thought Black Plague was better.
[0:48] <liq3> it's the only real gripe I have with the game.
[0:48] <Iguana> I got headphones on.
[0:48] <Iguana> Sso I'm scared as fuck. :/
[0:48] <Iguana> Black Plague is probably the best.
[0:48] <Eagle> Black Plague has NO combat system.
[0:48] <Iguana> The last one kinda sucked.
[0:48] <Eagle> All you can do is run
[0:48] <Eagle> The last one was a portal ripoff. :P
[0:48] <liq3> Eagle: that's an improvement imo. :P
[0:48] <Animator> I loved World of Goo, but I /hated/ how it felt with the Wii remote. Hated it.
[0:49] <Eagle> liq3: I know.
[0:49] <Eagle> :D
[0:49] <Animator> I can do so much better with a cursor.

[0:50] <LG_Legacy> But my mouse doesn't feel right
[0:50] <Iguana> I play rep league for soccer in the summer and I'm the goalie
[0:50] <Animator> I used to catch flags out of thin air in flag football.
[0:50] <LG_Legacy> It feels perfect for windows but not for games
[0:51] <Iguana> I shut out EVERY TEAM.
[0:51] <Iguana> Because I rape like that.
[0:51] <Animator> They'd still keep on running after I took their flag and they didn't realize it.

[0:51] <Iguana> I dont play football
[0:51] <Iguana> I just grab the flags

[0:51] <Animator> Yeah, in school.
[0:51] <liq3> I mean' how do you play? :P
[0:51] <Iguana> When we played CTF at school
[0:51] <LG_Legacy> Sometimes i get too good at FPS's :l
[0:51] <Iguana> Ohman
[0:51] <LG_Legacy> And then i require a bigger challenge when no one steps up to it

[2:32] <sorre> since we're pretty sure there's going to be enchanting, and gold fits the bill
[2:32] <Arukiia> Zod runes?

[3:10] <Scirppy> I'm trying to make them in groups that compliment eachother.
[3:10] <AzureAngelic> its good to have at least two dwarves training asap
[3:10] <AzureAngelic> both unarmed in leather armor/shields
[3:10] <AzureAngelic> so they build wrestling and armor user
[3:11] <Scirppy> I haven't had any goblin raids yet, thank god.

[3:13] <Scirppy> Is there any way to make sure your game saves?

[3:13] <AzureAngelic> oh
[3:13] <AzureAngelic> ok uh
[3:13] <AzureAngelic> you know how when you save it tells you the month and stuff right
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> er
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> season
[3:14] <Scirppy> Yeah.
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> well when you manually save
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> it saves to whenever you did it
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> like
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> my fort is in autumn
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> if i play until winter and then manually save and quit
[3:14] <LG_Legacy> Wananananana
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> it overwrites the autumn save
[3:14] <Scirppy> Oooooh.
[3:14] <Scirppy> I get it.
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> so unless i go back to a seasonal save, i keep loading the autumn save
[3:14] <AzureAngelic> yeah
[3:15] <AzureAngelic> its bothersome lol
[3:15] * Cial (chatzilla@209-42-180-63.wispnet.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[3:15] <Scirppy> So there will always be one save for each season?
[3:16] <AzureAngelic> yeah
[3:16] <AzureAngelic> unless you disable it, the game'll save every season
[3:16] <Scirppy> Will the year ever change in the saves?
[3:16] <AzureAngelic> yeah
[3:16] <Snowman> http://i43.tinypic.com/105z892.jpg
[3:16] <AzureAngelic> on the far right of the save screen is the year
[3:16] <Snowman> Kewl eh?
[3:16] <AzureAngelic> for me my main save is autumn 205
[3:16] <AzureAngelic> although my fort's in spring 206
[3:16] <Scirppy> Ahkay.
[3:16] <AzureAngelic> so i have autum 205, winter 205, spring 206
[3:17] <AzureAngelic> btw

[3:18] <AzureAngelic> keep an eye on the 'IDLERS:' at the top-right of the screen
[3:18] <Scirppy> Yeah.
[3:18] <AzureAngelic> if too many are idle either give them a menial job or temporarily change profession
[3:18] <Scirppy> I try to have as few as possible.
[3:18] <KodaichiZero> Guys
[3:18] <KodaichiZero> umm

[3:18] <AzureAngelic> and have them doing something productive
[3:18] <KodaichiZero> oh wait never mind.
[3:18] <Scirppy> I have the masons make blocks and have the rest of the people carry.
[3:18] <AzureAngelic> ?
[3:18] <KodaichiZero> I thought my typhlosion wanted to learn Hydro Pump

[3:18] <KodaichiZero> it's my gyarados
[3:19] <AzureAngelic> for building fortifications
[3:19] <AzureAngelic> dont teach it hydro pump lol
[3:19] <Scirppy> Well

[3:20] <Scirppy> So I'm going to assign jobs now
[3:20] <liq3> AzureAngelic: don't dig a square, dig rows 3 apart.
[3:20] <AzureAngelic> why?
[3:20] <liq3> Takes 1/3rd the time, finds all the gems anyway.
[3:20] <AzureAngelic> ah
[3:20] <Scirppy> I'm trying to have about 3 dwarves on important things
[3:20] <Scirppy> (each)
[3:20] <liq3> So like... rows like this. DWWDWWDWWDWW w = wall, d = dig.
[3:20] <Scirppy> and less important things
[3:20] <Scirppy> 2
[3:21] <AzureAngelic> well "important things" tends to vary
[3:21] <AzureAngelic> i've had 2 dwarves on cooking/brewing and 2 on farming since i started
[3:21] <AzureAngelic> and i have more than enough booze
[3:21] <liq3> Import things = food, water, furnature, and digging.
[3:21] <AzureAngelic> and food
[3:21] <liq3> erm, booz, not water.

[3:35] <Scirppy> Sort of like that one.
[3:35] <Scirppy> and then you make several z-stacks of it once you get more dwarves.
[3:35] <blaster> That looks like a stupid layout
[3:36] <Scirppy> Yes.
[3:36] <Scirppy> Mine is more space and walk-efficient
[3:36] <Scirppy> Albeit slightly less geometrically pretty.
[3:36] <blaster> Scrippy rooms that big for housing is bad
[3:36] <KodaichiZero> lol fractal map
[3:36] <Scirppy> My rooms range from 3x3-4x5
[3:36] <blaster> because it means that once the dwarvern economy starts everyone will end up homeless from the huge rents
[3:37] <Scirppy> D=
[3:37] <Scirppy> Balls.
[3:37] <blaster> Small is typicly better, but with some big rooms for better dwarfs
[3:37] <Scirppy> I'll make some fractal ghettos.
[3:37] <blaster> So if you start making small ones now then you should survive
[3:37] <Scirppy> I only have one z-level so far.
[3:37] <blaster> ghetto jobs are usualy haulers only dwarfs and dwarfs which only do the odd task (Like a dedicated leverpuller
[3:37] <Scirppy> So how big should the next rooms be?
[3:37] <blaster> 2x1
[3:37] <blaster> Lol
[3:37] <blaster> serious
[3:37] <Scirppy> 2x2?
[3:38] <Scirppy> Aww wat
[3:38] <blaster> Just a short coridor
[3:38] <blaster> with a bed at the end
[3:38] <blaster> Dwarfs are still perfectly happy with it
[3:38] <Snowman> Eagle
[3:38] <Eagle> That's me
[3:38] <Snowman> Like this? http://i42.tinypic.com/25txo4y.jpg
[3:38] <Scirppy> The economy doesn't take into account housing availability?

[3:38] <blaster> No scrippy
[3:38] <Eagle> Oh nice.
[3:38] <blaster> They take into account room vaule
[3:38] <Eagle> Just like that.
[3:39] <Snowman> Easy as pie :D
[3:39] <blaster> Also scrippy, if the rooms are dirt and only have a bed, large rooms are fine
[3:39] <blaster> but pointless still
[3:39] <Eagle> I would have done it myself but I have the worst photoshopping skills ever
[3:39] <Scirppy> I was thinking this
[3:39] <Scirppy> http://df.magmawiki.com/index.php/File:ClusterBedrooms.png
[3:39] <Scirppy> Is pretty and works.
[3:39] <blaster> Er... might take a while to design
[3:39] <Snowman> It's basically just selecting the eye, removing it, scaling the static, putting it in a layer behind the eye and then blur the edges a bit
[3:40] <Scirppy> Yeah.
[3:40] <Scirppy> I'm big on asthetics though.

[4:10] <blaster> All those wrestlers are training axes and only got a little wresting experience to reduce training accidents
[4:10] <AzureAngelic> population is 56
[4:10] <AzureAngelic> 10 military atm
[4:10] <blaster> I have pop of 85
[4:10] <AzureAngelic> all 10 are legendary wrestlers, planning to train half in crossbows and half in hammers

[4:11] <liq3> hammers i hear are only for certain things.

[5:04] <Scrippy> So how do i go about creating this military thing?
[5:04] <AzureAngelic> press m for a list of all your units
[5:05] <AzureAngelic> pick one to be a leader and press enter, and keep pressing enter to add to the squad and space when you're done
[5:05] <Snowman> "Thank goodness I have like W Blue Sky lives there. Shit."
[5:05] <AzureAngelic> once you have a squad press a to activate the leader, then v to view the squad and t to tell them to stand down
[5:05] <Snowman> Best quote ever
[5:05] <Snowman> Oh, I didn't do Ironmode btw
[5:05] <AzureAngelic> then go back to the military unit list, press w, and assign them weapons/armor
[5:05] <AzureAngelic> its best to leave them unarmed for a while
[5:05] <liq3> I always do.
[5:05] <liq3> < Uber hardcore that barley plays AS. >.>
[5:06] <AzureAngelic> while they're standing down they spend all their time in the barracks sparring, aka fighting each other to build stats
[5:06] <AzureAngelic> so if you give them adamantine battleaxes they'll chop each other to bits
[5:06] <liq3> Yeh... After a bit they won't hurt each other eiether.
[5:06] <liq3> AzureAngelic: does armour break?
[5:06] <AzureAngelic> no
[5:07] <liq3> ah.
[5:07] <liq3> Cool.
[5:07] <Firetempest> just gets dirty

[5:07] * liq3 facepalms
[5:07] <AzureAngelic> personally i leave my military unarmed until they've all hit legendary wrestler
[5:07] <AzureAngelic> give them leather armor/shields
[5:07] <Scrippy> hrk
[5:07] <liq3> You love hammers too eH?
[5:07] <AzureAngelic> they give them copper weapons once they're legendary wrestlers
[5:07] <liq3> I only ever got military in on efort...
[5:08] <liq3> Had fun watching goblins fly and 10+ tiles. <3
[5:08] <Scrippy> What's wrestler good for?
[5:08] <AzureAngelic> and then give them steel armor and steel weapons whenever i have enough
[5:08] <AzureAngelic> unarmed combat
[5:08] <vurtual> wrasslin', Scrippy
[5:08] <Scrippy> Well, dur.
[5:08] <AzureAngelic> it's easy to train and it raises overall stats
[5:08] <Scrippy> jMmkay.
[5:08] <Scrippy> Also, how do I make steel?
[5:08] <vurtual> well first
[5:08] <vurtual> get some iron ore
[5:08] <AzureAngelic> smelt magnetite ore for iron
[5:08] <vurtual> a fuel source, lots of it
[5:08] <liq3> Yeh raises combat stats.
[5:08] <Scrippy> And I'm guessing they'll need a good doctor.
[5:08] <Scrippy> Done done.
[5:08] <vurtual> massively smelt iron and create fuel
[5:08] <ZarroTsu> then you burn your house down
[5:08] <AzureAngelic> smelt iron and charcoal for pig iron
[5:08] <vurtual> then, get a flux stone
[5:08] <AzureAngelic> smelt pig iron and charcoal for steel
[5:08] <vurtual> lots of it
[5:08] <Firetempest> wrasslin lets you pop the heads of unconscious foes
[5:09] <AzureAngelic> like limestone
[5:09] <Scrippy> ZarroTsu: Burned my 6 story survival treehouse down
[5:09] <vurtual> then make pig iron
[5:09] <vurtual> then steel
[5:09] <liq3> Scrippy: lava = infinite fuel.
[5:09] <ZarroTsu> build a flux capacitor
[5:09] <Scrippy> I was trying to do controlled demolitions

[5:09] <AzureAngelic> you can see enemies on the unit list
[5:10] <AzureAngelic> abuse it
[5:10] <Scrippy> I do.
[5:10] <AzureAngelic> good
[5:10] <Scrippy> There were wolves.
[5:10] <Scrippy> augh wolves
[5:10] <liq3> Ultimate defense = 15+ deep pit, covered by a retracting drawbridge, that also has another drawbridge on both sides to wall it in. <3
[5:11] <AzureAngelic> my front gate is a drawbridge over a channel
[5:11] <AzureAngelic> the channel is 3 levels deep and has two more levels of lava at the bottom
[5:11] <liq3> haha.
[5:11] <AzureAngelic> sadly i havent had anybody try and attack me yet
[5:11] <liq3> Won't take long if your fort is decently sized.
[5:12] <AzureAngelic> actually im gonna replace the drawbridge with a retracting bridge
[5:12] <AzureAngelic> probably works better
[5:12] <liq3> well
[5:12] <liq3> if you want them to fall down... yes.
[5:12] <AzureAngelic> i do
[5:12] <AzureAngelic> god knows i'd never be able to atom smash moving targets lol
[5:12] <liq3> see, anything on a drawbridge when you raise it gets flung. :P
[5:12] <AzureAngelic> that too
[5:12] <liq3> not sure where tho....
[5:12] <liq3> but yeh.
[5:13] <AzureAngelic> the proble is my drawbridge retracts southward
[5:13] <AzureAngelic> aka flinging things onto my base
[5:13] <AzureAngelic> in hindsight i didnt really think that through
[5:13] <liq3> well if it's next to a wall. ;]

[5:32] <AzureAngelic> oar moths
[5:32] <vurtual> Then again the phrase would come out differently depending on how many words you left out
[5:32] <vurtual> so technically the whole thing= mountain dew is delicious
[5:33] <Konogan> anyway, mountain dew is a trademark so it stays mountain dew in japanese :P
[5:33] <vurtual> Japanese is not the language to learn to screw with people by suddenly speaking it when I walk by.
[5:33] <Zwazi> What has better mining ability, wood or gold?

[5:34] <Zwazi> I thought gold was a little faster

[5:34] <vurtual> I capitalized "Mountain Dew"
[5:34] <vurtual> got: Mauntende~y?? wa oishii desu
[5:34] <Zwazi> I use diamond for armor

[5:38] <Vis{AC}> Oh :( That doesn't suprise me, nobody wants to.

[5:38] <Vis{AC}> :)
[5:38] <LuciferZ> "Want to talk to Vis?" "Nah. He's retarded and gay." "Oh yeah."

[5:42] <Vis{AC}> It took me twelve minutes.
[5:43] <Vis{AC}> I hit my head against the wall in frustration, then some jackass came in and told me that this was a personanality test and the maze had no end path.
[5:43] <Vis{AC}> I shoved him and went home.

[5:48] <EmpiresBane> that's even worse...
[5:48] <EmpiresBane> that means you have 2 problems
[5:48] <Konogan> Of course, he's retarded because he's gay :P
[5:48] <Vis{AC}> And I'm not truly gay, I'm just, well, yet to find an equal mind on sexuality levels with my peers, I suppose.
[5:49] <sorre> sounds like a fancy way of admitting you're gay

[7:31] <EmpiresBane> aw hell, other people now what i mean to type more than i do...
[7:31] <Konogan> Aquaria, just started playing.
[7:31] <Dommys> Staring at my desktop > JC2
[7:31] <Vis{err}> The plotline was great.
[7:32] <liq3> Actually
[7:32] <liq3> Dwarf Fortress > JC2.
[7:32] <Vis{err}> The combat was motherfucking epic
[7:32] <AotC> <liq3> And Aquaria is an indie game that costs $30. >.> <- the shit? seriously?
[7:32] <Konogan> I'm kind of lost though.
[7:32] <liq3> AotC: Yes.
[7:32] <liq3> It's better then most AAA SP games.
[7:32] <liq3> :/
[7:32] <AotC> makes me glad it was in the pay what you want indie game bundle..
[7:32] <AotC> silly people paying 30 bucks..
[7:32] <Dommys> I got Aquaria for less than that.
[7:32] <Dommys> :D
[7:32] <liq3> It's better then most AAA SP games.
[7:33] <Miclee> Mass Effect 3 trailer next month at E3. :D
[7:33] <liq3> And people waste $50+ on those.
[7:33] <vurtual> Just Cause 2 has cheesy one liners, freeroamign fun, and other random bits of fun
[7:33] <Konogan> well, seriously, I paid the pack 1$. I wanted to pay 1 cent but I kind of felt bad XD
[7:33] <Dommys> "fun"
[7:33] <Dommys> vurtual, you are far too easily amused.. that shit was boring the same day I started playing it.
[7:33] <Miclee> JC2 is more of a sandbox, the missions are pretty much optional.
[7:34] <vurtual> Dommys, oh come on
[7:34] <Miclee> All I ever did was attach cars to huge planes.
[7:34] <vurtual> I spent days playing it
[7:34] <Miclee> :P
[7:34] <vurtual> the demo!
[7:34] <vurtual> raiding bases with choppers
[7:34] <Miclee> Tank + Plane = Crash into mountain.
[7:34] <vurtual> grappling hooking people to a vehicle I'm driving
[7:34] <Dommys> I played the damned thing for two weeks
[7:34] <liq3> Miclee: the problem with the "sandbox" part is thaht they basically copy/pasted the same military bases all over the map.
[7:34] <vurtual> pinning cars down in a chase
[7:34] <Dommys> But I was bored for most of it
[7:34] <Vis{err}> I had 72 hours on the demo
[7:34] <Dommys> Is it worth 50 bucks?
[7:34] <EmpiresBane> i wish i could play it.... it sounds like exactly what i want
[7:34] <Dommys> Hell fucking no
[7:34] <Konogan> Hey, how much hour is aquaria in gameplay time?
[7:34] <Vis{err}> Dommys: Yeah, it is.
[7:34] <Miclee> It's worth the $50.
[7:34] <liq3> Konogan: 20 hours for first play through if you don't cheat.
[7:34] <liq3> :P
[7:34] <Dommys> Vis, you won't be saying that when you don't have 260 bucks in your pocket burnign a whole.
[7:34] <Dommys> lol
[7:34] <Konogan> Lol.
[7:34] <Miclee> Mass Effect 1/2 I would've easily spent $100 each on.
[7:35] <Vis{err}> The ONLY flaw I see is one mission's map trigger.
[7:35] <Vis{err}> When you blow up the misiles, you can detonate all of them at once.
[7:35] <Vis{err}> Where the game wants to start a timer after two are gone.
[7:35] <Vis{err}> I sort of wish you could swing with your grapple gun too.
[7:35] <Miclee> And new Assassins Creed this fall
[7:35] <Miclee> :D
[7:35] <Vis{err}> That'd be cool.
[7:35] <liq3> I found mass effect meh.
[7:35] <liq3> I haven't liked an RPG since Morrowind honestly. :/
[7:35] <Miclee> Mass Effect is one of the best games I've played.
[7:35] <Vis{err}> Morrowind:D
[7:35] <EmpiresBane> you can't swing?
[7:36] <Vis{err}> EmpiresBane: You grapple.
[7:36] <EmpiresBane> yeah... but still...
[7:36] * Redshift (chatzilla@c-24-20-129-39.hsd1.or.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[7:36] <Miclee> You can swing, let go mid-air, do it again while in the air, continue
[7:36] <Vis{err}> I know, but that doesn't decrease the game's value.
[7:36] <Miclee> But it doesn't work well.
[7:36] <Konogan> Are the buildings destroyable in JC2?
[7:36] <EmpiresBane> do you just move in a straight line, or does it still behave like a rope?
[7:37] <liq3> Konogan: no.
[7:37] <Vis{err}> EmpiresBane: Both.
[7:37] <Konogan> Shame.
[7:37] <Vis{err}> That depends on how you grapple.
[7:37] <EmpiresBane> what?
[7:37] <Vis{err}> Well
[7:37] <liq3> EmpiresBane: straight line. It also disobeys the laws of physics.
[7:37] <Miclee> I wish Red Faction: Geurilla were longer.
[7:37] * Konogan go back playing Red Faction: Guerilla.
[7:37] <Vis{err}> tap F = straight line
[7:37] <Dommys> EmpiresBane, did you play Red Facton Guerilla?
[7:37] <Vis{err}> hold F = rope
[7:37] <EmpiresBane> yes
[7:37] <liq3> You can save yourself from a 5km drop by grappling the ground.
[7:37] <Konogan> Ninja'd
[7:37] <Vis{err}> and while parachuting = rope
[7:37] <Dommys> Then you've played JC2, minus the hookshot/parachute
[7:37] <Dommys> And Plus building destruction
[7:37] <Dommys> Same damned empty game
[7:37] <EmpiresBane> the hookshot shit is what i want
[7:38] <Vis{err}> Dommys is liar.
[7:38] <Dommys> It's No where near as cool as it should have been
[7:38] <Miclee> I found RF: G insanely fun, not empty.
[7:38] <Konogan> XD
[7:38] <EmpiresBane> i don't even care about a parachute
[7:38] <Dommys> Especially vanilla
[7:38] <Miclee> Dommys, you expect too much.
[7:38] <Vis{err}> It's got 6400 square miles of explorable area.
[7:38] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[7:38] <Vis{err}> Multiple vehicles.
[7:38] <Vis{err}> Intense combat
[7:38] <Dommys> Miclee, not for 50 bucks I don't
[7:38] <Konogan> What?
[7:38] <Miclee> You seem to be.
[7:38] <Konogan> JC2 got 6400 square miles?
[7:38] <Vis{err}> Yes.
[7:38] <Firetempest> only way to survive smacking into concrete at terminal velocity. hook shot the ground and hit it faster.
[7:38] <Konogan> That's quite a lot...
[7:38] <vurtual> yeah Konogan
[7:39] <vurtual> 1000 square km
[7:39] <vurtual> I don't think that's 6400 square miles though
[7:39] <Konogan> Makes me want to try it.
[7:39] <Firetempest> http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/1632-Just-Cause-2
[7:39] <Vis{err}> Hm, the pre-release 'review' said that instead of multiplayer, they were going for a huge explorable world.
[7:39] <vurtual> Konogan, there's cities too
[7:39] <vurtual> and car physics
[7:39] <Miclee> JC2 is fun(not the story, but just fucking around in it).
[7:39] <vurtual> Oh, and if you get in a car cahse(of your own wil)
[7:39] <Vis{err}> 6400 was what they used there.
[7:39] <vurtual> you can grapple a car to the ground
[7:39] <vurtual> and make it flip out wildly
[7:39] <Vis{err}> Hahahaha
[7:39] <liq3> Miclee: only for so long.
[7:40] <Miclee> I still play it occasionally.
[7:40] <Miclee> Still finding new things to do/play with.
[7:40] <Vis{err}> The hot air baloon is ftw

[7:40] <Miclee> Hot air balloon!?
[7:40] <Vis{err}> Yeah!
[7:40] <Vis{err}> It works, too!
[7:40] <Vis{err}> You cut off the bags with melee
[7:41] <Vis{err}> jump in
[7:41] <Vis{err}> and hold E to turn on the heat
[7:41] <Vis{err}> I took it to the mile high club
[7:41] <vurtual> I did too
[7:41] <vurtual> it was awesome
[7:41] <Vis{err}> :D
[7:41] <Vis{err}> I grappled a boat to it once, too.
[7:41] <Miclee> Grappling tanks to large planes is fun.
[7:42] <Miclee> I ended up 10000s of km off the map once.
[7:42] <Konogan> Endless... water...
[7:43] <vurtual> water
[7:44] <Konogan> water.

[7:46] <Konogan> XD
[7:47] <Konogan> sounds fun.
[7:47] <Firetempest> i like the sum up of the review. lame story BUT, it's still fun to hook shot a guy in the throat, attach him to a car, and drive through a cactus patch.
[7:47] <EmpiresBane> i wish i could be certain that JC2 would run
[7:47] <Vis{err}> I think it requires a x64 vista
[7:47] <Konogan> try the demo.
[7:47] <EmpiresBane> i need to redownload that
[7:48] <EmpiresBane> maybe they updated it
[7:48] <EmpiresBane> wait... 64bit?
[7:48] <liq3> Firetempest: the first five times. Then it's boring. :P
[7:48] <Vis{err}> liq3: So do other things.
[7:48] <liq3> I did.
[7:48] <Vis{err}> steal a double decker bus and crash it into a crane.
[7:48] <vurtual> I noticed that if I sit around doing nothing for long enough, I start thinking of porn.
[7:48] <liq3> I ran out of ideas pretty quickly. :/
[7:49] <vurtual> and now I remember Bolo Santosi's quote from the final mission
[7:49] <vurtual> and I'm wondering if that was innunedo or she's just crazy
[7:49] <Vis{err}> Why on earth did you pick Bolo?
[7:49] <vurtual> because the Sri was too normal
[7:49] <liq3> "Pick"?
[7:49] <vurtual> and Razman was lame
[7:49] <Vis{err}> liq3 hasn't even played through the whole game and he's saying it's boring.
[7:49] <vurtual> liq3, there's a point where you choosing a side for a mission
[7:49] <vurtual> you can pick any 3
[7:49] <vurtual> of the 3
[7:49] <liq3> Vis{err}: Yes, I got bored.
[7:50] <Vis{err}> That means he couldn't beat a mission and he ragequit
[7:50] <liq3> Hell no.
[7:50] <liq3> O.o
[7:50] <vurtual> it's one of the first, most direct missions
[7:50] <vurtual> you clearly never played it
[7:50] <Budda> wat
[7:50] <Budda> at the start
[7:50] <Budda> i did all 3
[7:50] <liq3> vurtual: ...It's not one of the first at all. If you're gonna lie do better then that.
[7:51] <Vis{err}> When you destroy the four misiles, how many charges does it take in total?
[7:51] <vurtual> I did it within one of my first hours
[7:51] <vurtual> of playing
[7:51] <vurtual> It's one of the main missions
[7:51] <Vis{err}> Anyone that's played accidentally blew themselves off and they would know
[7:51] <Vis{err}> vurtual is right, you can do that mission 3rd.
[7:52] * fkfjffffffff (Mibbit@bas14-montrealak-1177841123.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
[7:52] <liq3> Funny, cause I beat the guys at the Kings Hotel and well, think that was my last mission before getting bored.
[7:52] <liq3> Didn't find your so called "choice" mission.
[7:52] <vurtual> you quit fifteen minutes into the game?
[7:52] <fkfjffffffff> fffffff
[7:52] <vurtual> FIFTEEN MINTUES INTO THE GAME?
[7:52] <liq3> Ok now I know you guys are trolling.
[7:52] <vurtual> no really, that's nto very far
[7:52] <LG_Legacy> Problem?
[7:52] <vurtual> once you beat the three kings, you can freeroam
[7:52] <vurtual> which is the partp eople enjoy
[7:52] <Budda> vurtual: are you meaning after you rescue that guy and are back at his place?
[7:53] <Budda> is that the choice?
[7:53] <liq3> LG_Legacy: vurtual is trolling.
[7:53] <LG_Legacy> Thats not new

[7:54] <vurtual> I'm not trolling. :|
[7:54] <Firetempest> does shattered horizon have a decent single player campaign?
[7:54] <Budda> if hes talking about the choice of 3 faction missions at the start, then hes trolling
[7:54] <vurtual> I'm not
[7:54] <EmpiresBane> liq3, you're a little biased here... don't ya think?
[7:54] <vurtual> it's still pretty early
[7:54] <Budda> cause you can do all 3
[7:54] <Malikat> vurtual always trolls
[7:54] <Vis{err}> Nah, liq3 is sayin that JC2 sucks without even playing to the start of the game.
[7:54] <vurtual> That hurt, Malikat.
[7:54] <vurtual> >_>
[7:54] <liq3> EmpiresBane: That's what I mean by trollin.

[7:55] <vurtual> JC2's first two start missions are fairly short, and they're mostly just tutorials.

[7:55] <liq3> 3 kings is a few hours in, at least.
[7:55] <liq3> And that's if you only do the missions.
[7:55] <Plus-san> are you a monkey or are you a typewriter?
[7:55] <Malikat> my dick is a few hours in
[7:55] <Vis{err}> You can play the final mission 3 missions after the casino.

[8:03] <vurtual> A doom movie should be basically
[8:04] <vurtual> an action movie, nothing but
[8:05] <Malikat> if i were to make a doom movie right now
[8:05] <Malikat> it would start with a dude being a total badass
[8:05] <Malikat> like fucking bitches or something?
[8:05] <liq3> vurtual: should be horror/action.
[8:05] <Malikat> and he gets a call, "what is it?" "We need you, sir." "for?" "demons. demons from hell"
[8:05] <liq3> Also they've already made a doom movie.
[8:05] <Malikat> THE ENTIRE REST OF THE MOVIE would be first person mayhem

[8:07] <vurtual> Then he laughs and revvs up a chainsaw
[8:07] <vurtual> not in first person or anything
[8:07] <liq3> Then it runs out of ammo, and he'll fight them bare handed.... and win.
[8:07] <vurtual> Also, flipping the chainsaw down, ramming it down one more humanoid one's head from the top
[8:07] <vurtual> splitting him in half
[8:08] <Konogan|AFK> then he remove is headwear and... IT'S CHUCK NORRIS!
[8:08] <vurtual> no, his helmet's already half blown off
[8:08] <Konogan|AFK> anyway, I'm gone now...
[8:08] <vurtual> also he should grunt yellingly RIP AND TEAR
[8:08] <Malikat> YES IT IS CHUCK NORRIS
[8:09] <Konogan|AFK> Wait wait, I got a incredible scene that would be really awesome.
[8:09] <vurtual> his voice actor should be the industrial robot from quake 2's one
[8:09] <vurtual> the one that goes TRESSPASSER
[8:09] <vurtual> and then rapes you with a sharp pointy thing
[8:11] <Konogan|AFK> It's in a Halo movie. You see a spartan fighting convenent and floods. He runs out of armor and a bullet pierce his helmet's window. He slowly remove his helmet... Then you see chuck norris with the bullet between his theeth. :DDDD
[8:11] <Konogan|AFK> Anyway, NOW I'm gone.
[8:12] <Malikat> omfg kono
[8:12] <Malikat> i would shit myself in the theatre

[10:24] <Christoph> Hello.
[10:24] <kwerty> Ohai
[10:25] <Christoph> Can someone give me some advice on water mechanics?
[10:25] <liq3> such as?
[10:25] <Christoph> I'm irrigating a large farm inside of a hill.
[10:25] <Christoph> And I have a channel, two squares deep, that runs from the edge of the outside of the hill, where the water runs past, to the inside where the farm is.
[10:26] <Christoph> I've run a network of channels under each strip of dirt for the farm.
[10:26] <Christoph> All two squares deep.
[10:26] <Christoph> But the water only flows up to where it meets the grid of farm channels.
[10:26] <Christoph> Once it reaches there, it fills up the first farm channel in the row, and the rest it only fills the bottom square.
[10:27] <Christoph> So it's only irrigating one strip of dirt.
[10:27] <Christoph> The rest have a space of air underneath them.
[10:27] <Christoph> I can't figure out how to get the water to run all the way through the other channels.
[10:27] <Christoph> It just won't flow...
[10:27] <Malikat> water can go down, but not up
[10:27] <Christoph> Yes.
[10:28] <Christoph> It doesn't need to.
[10:28] <Christoph> Every channel is parallel with the source.
[10:28] <Malikat> so it's not spreading into all the paths?
[10:28] <Christoph> Which source channel*
[10:28] <Christoph> Exactly.
[10:28] <Malikat> oh. you don't have it connected to an infinite water source
[10:28] <Christoph> It went down the first farm channel, but only made a shallow strip on the others.
[10:28] <Christoph> I do.
[10:28] <Malikat> so it's running out of water
[10:29] <Christoph> It's connected to a canal connected to the ocean.
[10:29] <Christoph> That's why I'm so frustrated.
[10:29] <Christoph> It doesn't make any sense.
[10:29] <Malikat> the top layer is somehow disconnected
[10:29] <Christoph> That's what I thought.
[10:29] <Malikat> maybe there is some point where your water source passes under a strip of land at the top layer of the channel's elevation
[10:29] <Christoph> I thought that too, but they're all parallel.
[10:30] <Christoph> I don't know what the hell is going on.
[10:30] <kwerty> Are you talking about DF?
[10:30] <liq3> you playing... indev?
[10:30] <liq3> Yeh of course...
[10:31] <liq3> Christoph: make sure the water can't flow out from the channels....
[10:31] <liq3> There's a bug (or was... probably still is) in indev that does what you described... :/
[10:31] <Christoph> I'll muck through each one for a bit and double check.
[10:32] <PyroBooby> oh emm gee multiplayer is out
[10:32] <AndrewPH> Hey LG_Legacy
[10:32] <LG_Legacy> ?
[10:32] <AndrewPH> above
[10:32] * PyroBooby was kicked from #minecraft by LG_Legacy
[10:33] <Christoph> Yeah, I'm drenching the channels right now looking for cave holes.
[10:33] <Christoph> Though, if it were draining out into the network of caves below the hill(I think I flooded those when I was digging the canal earlier this week) it should have stopped draining at some point...
[10:33] <Christoph> I think it might be a bug.
[10:34] <liq3> o.o. I'd be scared of my carpender. She has 5 Troglodyte kills, and only wound she got is a smashed toe. >.>
[10:35] <Christoph> I'm going to try just carving out everything under the farm area so it's ALL one big space under the farm, rather than just under the dirt strips.
[10:35] <liq3> Christoph: the bug is basically... If a infinite water source flows into a pool of water connected to the ocean, it won't fill up. :/
[10:35] <liq3> It's Notch's "waterfall" code...
[10:36] <Christoph> Hmmm.
[10:36] <Christoph> So if I dry up the water...
[10:36] <liq3> Christoph: also you do have channels on the same level as the farm?
[10:36] <Christoph> completely.
[10:36] <liq3> You need to make sure there's no outwards sources.
[10:36] <liq3> :P
[10:36] <Christoph> And then flood again, it should conceivably fill all the channels up?
[10:36] <liq3> You need to make sure there's no outwards sources.
[10:36] <Christoph> Hmm.
[10:36] <Christoph> Yeah.
[10:37] <Christoph> It only enters from the source channel connected to the canal.
[10:37] <Christoph> But I think I might know where it's messing up, then.
[10:37] <Christoph> Thanks liq3.
[10:37] <Christoph> I'll try some stuff.

[10:47] <Christoph> I was stuck under water and had to turn around and swim all the way back to the farm .
[10:48] <Christoph> But yeah.
[10:48] <Christoph> It did the same thing.
[10:48] <Christoph> Filled the bottom layer of the farm channels, but not the top.
[10:48] <Marach> ...minecraft?
[10:48] <Christoph> In fact, it filled less of the first channel than before.

[10:49] * Smashing (Smashing@adsl-82-114-21.jax.bellsouth.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[10:50] <Malikat> so if i find a murky pool in DF and use it to irrigate, will it go away or stay as a pool?
[10:50] <Christoph> If it's a pool, it should drain out after a while, eh?
[10:50] <Christoph> It's finite, correct?
[10:51] <Christoph> Not attached to the ocean?
[10:51] <Malikat> that would make sense
[10:51] <Malikat> i've not played DF before though
[10:51] <Marach> nothing is infinite
[10:51] <Christoph> Yeah, it should dry up after a while.
[10:51] <Christoph> Some pools dry up on their own if they're shallow enough.
[10:52] <Marach> waait
[10:52] <Christoph> Or if the dwarve drink them.
[10:52] <Marach> can you have 1x1 ocean?
[10:52] <Christoph> I have no idea.
[10:52] <Marach> infinite supply of water!
[10:52] <Christoph> That would be funny.
[10:52] <Christoph> I'm sure it's moddable.
[10:52] <Christoph> Unless the ocean water is supplied from squares off the edge of the map.
[10:52] <Christoph> World map*
[10:52] <Christoph> Like, it just flows out of the borders or something.
[10:53] <Christoph> I'm not completely sure how the oceans work in DF.
[10:53] <Shadaez> all yo uguys talk about is DF
[10:53] <Marach> didn't you notice before? :/
[10:53] <Shadaez> yeah
[10:53] <Christoph> Not true.
[10:54] <Christoph> I had a minecraft question that SOUNDED like a DF question.
[10:54] <liq3> Malikat: it'll drain out.
[10:54] <liq3> Oceans, rivers and quaifiers are the only infinite sources of water afiak.
[10:55] <Marach> <Marach> can you have 1x1 ocean?
[10:55] <liq3> you mean on the local screen?
[10:55] <liq3> Well I think ocean is salt water... So it's not actually drinkable. :D
[10:55] <Marach> no idea, never played df. just curious
[10:56] <Christoph> I thought the dwarves could still drink well-water from ocean sources.
[10:56] <liq3> Christoph: maybe...
[10:56] <liq3> I dunno.
[10:56] <Christoph> I seem to remember it saying something like that on the wiki.
[10:56] <Christoph> It might of been changed, though.

[11:40] <Christoph> If someone shatters it, it floods the building.
[11:40] <Christoph> But I was thinking of an interesting idea.
[11:41] <Marach-14> yeah, smp will add a new layer of clan integration
[11:41] <Christoph> If you built a vertical tower.
[11:41] <Christoph> That was six stone thick.
[11:41] <Marach-14> Christoph: who said there is air inside?
[11:41] <Christoph> You have to have air or you die, dude.
[11:41] <Marach-14> well they're squids
[11:41] <Christoph> Just because they have squid skins doesn't mean they breathe underwater : P

[11:47] <Christoph> Like... five.
[11:47] <Naserve> Pay at least 5, dont be a total dick
[11:47] <Marach-14> i got it for five
[11:47] <Christoph> I could pay for the total value.

[12:36] <yoshibot> a glass catwalk structure above a large farm plot would be a little too impractical? :<
[12:36] <Christoph> Glass?
[12:36] <Christoph> Sourcery!
[12:36] <Christoph> But I don't understand what you mean.
[12:36] <Marach-15> you don't see all faces of glass
[12:37] <Firetempest> it only renders the side that faces you, the rest of it is a simple outline.
[12:37] <Marach-15> sometimes you see the covered ones, sometimes not
[12:37] <Marach-15> nope, there is no outline
[12:37] <yoshibot> i was thinking about making an underground farm with a glass catwalk above it so i could tend the crops without risking trampling them
[12:37] <Christoph> That's true...
[12:37] <Christoph> But how do you collect the seeds/wheat?
[12:37] <yoshibot> use the natural 2~3 block reach
[12:38] <Christoph> But...
[12:38] <yoshibot> hmm.
[12:38] <Marach-15> actually it's 4
[12:38] <Christoph> The pick-up isn't that close, is it?
[12:38] <yoshibot> should probably have an entryway into it
[12:38] <Firetempest> actually, the outline if me highlighting it with the curser, otherwise no outline
[12:38] <Firetempest> is*
[12:38] <Marach-15> that's a different thing
[12:38] <yoshibot> it's a shame you can't hydroponically farm easily
[12:39] <Christoph> What I do is make a rows of farmland separated by alternating strips of water and dirt.
[12:39] <Christoph> Err, wood.
[12:39] <Marach-15> but leaves are rendered differently. you always see every face
[12:39] <Christoph> Or whatever for walkways.
[12:39] <yoshibot> but just using the waterways to move might be more efficient

[12:39] <Firetempest> that may change Marach. the new larger trees are killing a lot of people
[12:39] <Marach-15> ...what?

[12:39] <yoshibot> the physics are still off
[12:40] <Christoph> Yeah.
[12:40] <Marach-15> trees can kill now?
[12:40] <Christoph> I spent several hours trying to get it to fill in under the farm.

[12:40] <Malikat> nor can i figure out what is metal <___<
[12:40] <Christoph> Because the damn water doesn't irrigate farmland when it's underneath it....

[12:41] <Malikat> apparently

[12:42] <yoshibot> were they a new addition?
[12:42] <Malikat> i dunno!
[12:42] <yoshibot> because these dwarves seriously needed one for a while

[13:15] <Shadaez> eh you're right
[13:15] <Shadaez> grooveshark probably has a lot more songs
[13:15] <Marach-15> all tracks are uploaded by users
[13:16] <Marach-15> kwerty: yeah. $3 per month
[13:16] * Roadcrosser (im-a-pc@116.206.131.251) has joined #minecraft

[13:17] <Marach-15> o rly? http://help.grooveshark.com/blog/emi-drops-suit-against-grooveshark-music-service-licenses-it-instead
[13:18] <Shadaez> brb im gonna go get that speaker system and set it up hopefully :D
[13:18] <Shadaez> I think it's broken but I should be able to fix it now, with my newly learnt soldering skillz
[13:19] <kwerty> And I think their ToS state that you are liable for uploading a song, not Grooveshark's parent company
[13:21] <Schaap> Whats the meaning of all the digit thingemies in Indev?

[13:21] <Marach-15> lighting, mobs, generation stuff
[13:22] <Schaap> i figured that much, but each of them exactly
[13:23] <Schaap> Like L is counting down when i pauze the game
[13:23] <Schaap> but up when i play it
[13:23] <Malikat> L is the lighting updates in queue

[13:26] <Codlike> eventually it updated the lighting and crashed after exploring a while

[14:31] <ez> what do you do?

[14:32] <ez> =) programming what?
[14:33] <Shadaez> well, soldering didn't fix it
[14:33] <Shadaez> uh
[14:34] <Shadaez> probably the first thing I can get a job at, then I plan on making indie games while I work, untill it, if ever, becomes a good enough income to rely on
[14:34] <ez> so games it what you really want to do =)
[14:34] <ez> cool
[14:35] <ez> I wish I could learn just some programming at all some day
[14:36] <Shadaez> you can
[14:36] <Marach-15> learn from Notch.
[14:36] <Shadaez> I'm sure notch is willing to teach
[14:36] <ez> yeah, he showed me some
[14:36] <Marach-15> confusing?
[14:36] <ez> I did a hello world and played around with some classes in java
[14:36] <ez> on the eee pc lol

[14:50] <SpecDriX> i left it there for 20 mins
[14:50] <SpecDriX> praying it was the servers lag
[14:50] <SpecDriX> or something

[14:50] <SpecDriX> i have 1 gig of ram 2 ghz processor a 5 meg connection

[15:42] <Rithiur> I'd prefer to have everything on steam, but if I can save 15e by not using it, the convenience isn't worth it.
[15:42] <Marach-15> Rithiur: sure
[15:42] <kwerty> ugh where do you buy your games then? A finn here too
[15:43] <Marach-15> orange box in shop is 2 times cheaper than in stream
[15:43] <Marach-15> steam*
[15:43] <Shadaez> so what? It activates on steam
[15:43] <ez> mwahhaa Shadaez
[15:43] <ez> I beat you with one day ;)

[15:43] <ez> member since
[15:43] <Rithiur> kwerty: I buy new games via Verkkokauppa's ahvenanmaa order system, so you get it without tax. It's awesome cheap for games that's available there.
[15:43] <Shadaez> off

[15:44] <ZomBuster> altough steam can have discounts too
[15:44] <Marach-15> hm. minecrafting for 5 hours already
[15:44] <Rithiur> kwerty: Yeah. Check under the "Suoratoimitukset". The games there are sold via Ahvenanmaa. No tax and free shipping.

[15:46] <Shadaez> wtf
[15:46] <Marach-15> lol, discounts
[15:46] <Shadaez> i hear some really weird sounds
[15:47] <Marach-15> games from shop are much cheaper even when steam has a discount
[15:47] <Shadaez> like a squeky toy, I guess, coming from upstairs (it's 4 in the morning)

[15:47] <kwerty> Not always, sometimes they sell great games for under 5 euros
[15:47] <PixelEater> this time i found it thru a MC livestream :)
[15:47] <Rithiur> Marach-15: Not really, when you're talking about -50% or -75% kind of discounts. Shops can't sell that cheap at all. Plus, it's pain in the ass to find any cheap discounts here in Finland. Shops don't do them that much.
[15:48] <Marach-15> i thought you're talking about this:
[15:48] <bildramer> Shadaez: a sqeaky baby
[15:48] <Marach-15> 
[15:48] <Shadaez> it might be coming from the aquarium I guess..
[15:48] <bildramer> lol
[15:48] <Shadaez> ah, that's probably it

[15:49] <Rithiur> Or rather, I can't be bothered to check real shops for discounts. It's easy to find them on steam, but trying to go trough discount bins in shops is boring :P

[17:28] <Quatroking> not swf
[17:28] <vurtual> They may or may not try to loot my house again out of desperation.
[17:28] <vurtual> What weapon would be ideal for scaring them off?

[17:29] <Quatroking> span them across your window
[17:29] <vurtual> (note: should be able to just be fired off into the air safely, and still be armed. Fire and forget launchers and BFGs are not a good idea.)
[17:29] <vurtual> Like I keep all my shiny stuff in my house.
[17:29] <Quatroking> and put electricity on it
[17:29] <vurtual> We have lots of little garages around too, it's not just one building.
[17:29] <bildramer> flamethrower

[22:24] <Yourself> that people*
[22:24] <Speljohan__> well, if he really wanted to he could do it in days
[22:24] <Yourself> what makes everyone think that?
[22:24] <Speljohan__> i have strong doubts there's any reason for him to rewrite the old mp protocol at all
[22:24] <vurtual> Having the ability to spam super missiles really helps
[22:25] <Yourself> the old mp protocol is garbage
[22:25] <Speljohan__> hence it's just a matter of reimplementing it
[22:25] <Speljohan__> and bam done
[22:25] <Yourself> and doesn't support infinite maps
[22:25] <Speljohan__> that isn't hard to add though
[22:25] <Speljohan__> it's pretty much a copy paste of client code
[22:25] <whatdoestha> Except it has to be synchronized between all clients.
[22:25] <Yourself> he's trying to redesign it

[22:26] <Yourself> the old protocol had a lot of seemingly redundant packets
[22:26] <Speljohan__> syncing isn't very hard with java networking whatdoestha
[22:26] <vurtual> My mom got paranoid when she heard me playing metroid prime 2
[22:26] <Yourself> and was based on TCP rather than UDP
[22:26] <vurtual> Of course she probably thinks metroid is a-okay.
[22:26] <Speljohan__> what he needs to do though is stop using the java sockets directly
[22:26] <Speljohan__> and move on to using NIO
[22:27] <vurtual> Although I still remember that kid who couldn't even play the NES metroid because it was too "violent" and dirty
[22:27] <vurtual> I am not even remotely kidding there.

[22:31] <Yourself> which i'm desperately in need of

[22:32] <Speljohan__> i started programming when i was 12-13 or so
[22:32] <Speljohan__> as in, i started learning seriously
[22:32] <vurtual> Yourself, it's going someplace different
[22:32] <Speljohan__> around the time i was 15 i knew more than what any college could ever teach me
[22:32] <vurtual> with comfy beds
[22:32] <Speljohan__> i think i have wasted my life :(
[22:32] <vurtual> Now, if you're like me, the best vacation is slapping your RV down somewhere else.

[23:22] <vurtual> including a guy who tries to sell you it for lots of money, while it's actually a magikarp named after the pokemon(spelled wrong)
[23:23] <AzureAngel> well its a coal pokemon
[23:23] <AzureAngel> i dont think we have a steam pokemon yet
[23:23] <vurtual> But it just appears much later as a fairly semi-common pokemon.

[23:24] <AzureAngel> my list of wants in the 5th gen: kickass fire/bug fireant, jynx evo, absol evo, pinsir evo, skarmory prevo, fire/dragon, flying/fighting, no fire/fightings, no god damned flying/bugs
[23:24] <vurtual> and it'd be some kind of normal-looking creature with conflicting, subdued patterns of dark red and dark cyan.
[23:24] <bildramer> wolframalpha can solve most things I search anyway <3
[23:24] <vurtual> Jynx has an evo don't they
[23:24] <AzureAngel> no
[23:24] <vurtual> also stop giving pokemon evolves
[23:24] <AzureAngel> smoochum > jynx
[23:24] <vurtual> seriously
[23:24] <vurtual> I'm tired of it.
[23:25] <AzureAngel> i dont blame you
[23:25] <vurtual> pinsir can stay pinsir
[23:25] <AzureAngel> but all three have so much potentional
[23:25] <AzureAngel> just no stats
[23:25] <AzureAngel> ):
[23:25] <vurtual> also nostalgia because I haven't heard pinsir mentioned since 2000

[23:25] <AzureAngel> and jynx got gipped
[23:25] <AzureAngel> electabuzz and magmar both evolve now
[23:25] <AzureAngel> jynx doesnt
[23:25] <AzureAngel> wtf gamefreak
[23:26] <vurtual> maybe pinsir can have a nonstandard evolution.
[23:26] <AzureAngel> yeah
[23:26] <vurtual> Like, some item in the game that's kinda rare, and can make pokemon evolve.
[23:26] <AzureAngel> like scyther
[23:26] <AzureAngel> im pretty sure scyther and pinsir are counterparts
[23:26] <AzureAngel> and scyther got an item-trade evo
[23:26] <vurtual> never thought about that
[23:26] <AzureAngel> jynx/magmar/electabuzz are a trio, scyther/pinsir are a duo
[23:26] <vurtual> Never really even remotely noticed scyther and scizor were related.
[23:26] <vurtual> :|
[23:26] <AzureAngel> skarmory/mantine are a duo
[23:27] <AzureAngel> hence why i want evos for them

[23:28] <AzureAngel> and out of those 7
[23:28] <AzureAngel> one is ditto, one is farfetch'd and one is aerodactyl
[23:28] <vurtual> yeah having all of them evolve is pretty far fetched
[23:29] <AzureAngel> that just leaves pinsir, tauros, kangashkan and something else i cant think of right now
[23:29] <vurtual> ditto on kangaskahn

[23:32] <vurtual> every last one
[23:32] <AzureAngel> quatro, it did in the anime
[23:32] <AzureAngel> kinda
[23:32] <vurtual> then it evolves into a normal version of missingno.
[23:32] <vurtual> as a proper pokemon, a proper number 0
[23:32] <AzureAngel> i remember being one episode where it turned into a cannon and shot the fuck out of team rocket
[23:32] <Quatroking> have a ditto transform into a hot girl

[23:35] <Quatroking> its funny how ash saw Ho-oh in the very first episode of the anime, while pokemon gold wasn't even announced
