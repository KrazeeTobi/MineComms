[0:00] <blaster> The signs
[0:00] <vurtual> yep
[0:00] <vurtual> but what if combat DOES occours.
[0:00] <vurtual> You can't create a dungeon without dungeon GUARDS.
[0:01] <blaster> You come up with an overelaborate plan to kill them in 1 turn
[0:01] * Slash-Caps (Slash-caps@94-195-154-156.zone9.bethere.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
[0:01] <Nyght> What Vurtual?
[0:01] <Nyght> Whats wrong with combat occuring?
[0:01] <blaster> Or fall through the roof... landing on them with your fat ass and killing them

[0:02] <blaster> Miclee is skilled at doing that
[0:02] <Nyght> Lol he told me about that
[0:02] <vurtual> Okay I am interested in your D&D IRC.
[0:03] <vurtual> as long as I'm not just walking through generic dungeons all day or something.
[0:03] <fenixfurion> (Insert Generic Dungeon Here)
[0:03] <vurtual> Like, you have to have very interesting dungeons, you know.
[0:03] <vurtual> then you won't go "Why is this a dungeon? It's a gigantic tunnel system is all, this serves no purpose."
[0:04] <- *Pwnly* Hi
[0:04] <vurtual> Because only the chaotic item creators could conjure up a sewer dungeon of acid, that requires a low DC will saving roll to not be warped into a random location.
[0:04] <vurtual> or just something interesting at all.

[0:28] <vurtual> Also if I were to become a wizard would I properly be able to be a wizard?
[0:29] <blaster> Ok, to put things simply
[0:29] <vurtual> What about a ranger? What classes do you guys be?
[0:29] <blaster> Wizards are shit until they get 2nd level spells
[0:29] <vurtual> Ok, to put things simply
[0:29] <blaster> Wizards power increases expodationaly for some reason
[0:29] <vurtual> Wizards can cast magic missile.
[0:29] <Marach> when you google "webcomic", xkcd is first...
[0:29] <vurtual> Are you questioning 1d4 damage?
[0:29] <vurtual> ONE D FOUR MAN
[0:29] <blaster> First level, 1d4+1, once a day
[0:29] <vurtual> and?
[0:29] <vurtual> Gotta start somewhere.
[0:30] <blaster> Second level, 1d4+2, twice a day
[0:30] <blaster> Get my point here
[0:30] <blaster> Not only does the damage go up, but so does the number of uses
[0:30] <vurtual> Wait a second
[0:30] <Nyght> ^
[0:30] <liq3> 3rd level?
[0:30] <blaster> 1d4+3, 3 times a day
[0:30] <vurtual> this does not sound right
[0:30] <liq3> it goes like that forever?
[0:30] <vurtual> isn't magic missile 1d4+1, with one more missile every two caster levels?
[0:31] <Nyght> Yes
[0:31] <Nyght> Thats when you fire it though
[0:31] <Nyght> You would shoot two missles instead of one
[0:31] <blaster> the +X is your caster level
[0:31] <blaster> So it would be 2d4+3 at level 3, or something
[0:31] <vurtual> where are you citing this
[0:32] <blaster> And wizards can blow up the whole world at level 11 anyway
[0:32] <liq3> blaster: that's not exponetional.
[0:32] <DimJim> dairy
[0:32] <vurtual> I just checked the SRD and it said 1d4+1, not +caster level
[0:32] <blaster> Facepalm
[0:32] <vurtual> WHAT CAN I TRUUUST
[0:32] <blaster> Ugh I must of been mixing them up
[0:32] * Tamschi (Tamschi@p5DC11215.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #minecraft
[0:32] <Marach> um the hell, vgcats is quite high in google
[0:32] <liq3> ./me facepalms*
[0:33] <blaster> but some spells are indeed like that
[0:33] <vurtual> cure light wounds is +caster isn't it.
[0:33] <vurtual> all the cure x wounds
[0:33] <blaster> Yes, thats the thing
[0:33] <blaster> Except cure minor, which is used to heal 1hp
[0:33] <vurtual> yeah
[0:33] <blaster> Stabilises someone who is dying
[0:33] <liq3> lol CAD is 5th.
[0:33] <vurtual> shocking things of the day: Ctrl+Alt+Del, VGCats, xkcd, and Penny Arcade are popular.
[0:33] <vurtual> gasp
[0:34] <Marach> lol
[0:34] <Marach> cad used to be good :/
[0:35] <blaster> The reason they made V3.5 is because V3 had many game breakers
[0:35] <Marach> well, xkcd too
[0:35] <liq3> vurtual: what I love is how much hate there is for XKCD and CAD.
[0:35] <liq3> :P
[0:35] * TecmagDiams (Mibbit@c-98-244-58-224.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:35] <blaster> At level 11 a wizard could use the spell create matter
[0:35] <liq3> e.g. Marach.
[0:35] <vurtual> xkcd is hated by stupid people
[0:35] <Marach> and i never liked pa
[0:35] * Conde (sefol@83.34.196.148) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:35] <blaster> To make a 650KG cube of anti osminium
[0:35] <vurtual> cad is hated by people who can't bother with a mild story
[0:35] <blaster> That is enough to blow up a entire planet
[0:35] <Marach> i tried many times
[0:35] <vurtual> also yeah you're right about 1 1st level spell per day at first level.
[0:36] <Marach> just like aphex twin. everyone else likes it
[0:36] <blaster> And 0 level are just magic tricks
[0:36] <liq3> I don't like PA either.
[0:36] <vurtual> what are some 0th level spells though
[0:36] <vurtual> I want to know my magic tricks.
[0:36] * Eythor (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) has joined #minecraft
[0:36] * fenixfurion is now known as fenixfurion|AFK
[0:36] <blaster> I think there is a 0 level spell which is, quite simply, a magic trick
[0:36] <Marach> ew, my grooveshark vip has ended :/
[0:37] <Marach> if i close grooveshark desktop, i won't be able to open it again.
[0:37] <liq3> Anyone here wanna learn a new game?
[0:37] * Kodaichi (silentj43@bas6-hamilton14-1176215641.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:37] <TecmagDiams> So then... >.>
[0:37] <Marach> windows PLEASE don't reboot for no reason
[0:37] <Marach> again
[0:37] <Visiiri> Kikikikikiki!
[0:37] <vurtual> like what are some 0th level spells in specific
[0:38] <TecmagDiams> At least windows has compatibility.
[0:38] <Visiiri> conjure
[0:38] <Cat> !blog
[0:38] <TecmagDiams> Even if it does like things like rebooting...
[0:38] <TecmagDiams> all the time....
[0:38] <Ten_Tacles> Any idea what I could do?
[0:39] <blaster> The spell Open/Close, which opens and closes small things
[0:39] <blaster> Completely pointless
[0:39] <vurtual> I dunno, what if you had to use it for an innovative reason?
[0:39] <vurtual> like close someone's eyes.
[0:39] <vurtual> hurting their spot check or something
[0:39] <blaster> It only does it as an instant effect
[0:39] <Ten_Tacles> Closing their holes.
[0:39] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[0:39] <blaster> As in, it would be like them blinking
[0:39] <vurtual> "Wha-what? My eyes are closed."
[0:39] * Kimd41 (chatzilla@212.183.196.16.dyn.user.ono.com) Quit (Max SendQ exceeded)
[0:40] <vurtual> actually I'd more expect it to last until they willingly and noticably open their eyes
[0:40] <TecmagDiams> Ok, so I was thinking about it correctly, it is DnD talk...
[0:40] <vurtual> What if someone failed a spot check on their eyes closing!?
[0:41] * gdude2002 (colesgaret@109.76.23.242) Quit (Quit: BEEP! LACK OF MATURITY DETECTED!)
[0:41] <blaster> The only useful one is detect magic, or read magic
[0:41] <TecmagDiams> Yay cantrips...
[0:41] <blaster> Without at least one of those its almost impossible to play as a magic character
[0:41] <vurtual> no really what if you actually had someone fail the spot check on their eyes being closed
[0:41] <vurtual> They could spend multiple rounds, blind!
[0:42] <blaster> You dont spot your eyes being closed
[0:42] <vurtual> natural 1
[0:42] <TecmagDiams> Ghost Sound can be useful as well.
[0:42] <blaster> It would be a intelligence check, DC -5
[0:42] <vurtual> they were daydreaming.
[0:42] <TecmagDiams> >.>
[0:42] <blaster> So only a creature with a intelligence score of 0 could fail
[0:42] <vurtual> natural 1.
[0:42] <TecmagDiams> I hate being lost, coming into conversation half-way started.
[0:42] <vurtual> or close their helmet visor or something.
[0:42] <blaster> Or that
[0:42] <vurtual> TecmagDiams, D&D
[0:42] <vurtual> Discussing the use of 0th level spells
[0:43] <TecmagDiams> I got that
[0:43] <TecmagDiams> Hence my previous comments on cantrips
[0:43] <blaster> Lol at kinky spells
[0:43] <TecmagDiams> What about cantrips is the conversation tohugh?
[0:43] <TecmagDiams> *though
[0:43] <vurtual> Ideally close could work on abstract concepts
[0:43] <vurtual> so you could close a bucket.
[0:44] <blaster> Ok, how about using enlarge
[0:44] <vurtual> but that is not here nor there
[0:44] <blaster> What do you think that is used for
[0:44] <vurtual> bigger boner
[0:44] <blaster> Duh
[0:44] <vurtual> bigger sword literally, for combat bonuses?
[0:44] <blaster> Bigger boobs on an enemy, to reduce their movement speed
[0:44] <vurtual> bigger eyelids so they go blind
[0:45] * fenixfurion|AFK (Fenix@74-140-206-154.dhcp.insightbb.com) Quit (Quit: The Game)
[0:45] * Kimd41 (chatzilla@212.183.196.16.dyn.user.ono.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:45] <blaster> Using your boner as a offhand club, with your groin as a 3rd arm
[0:45] <TecmagDiams> Bigger hands, for said bigger boobs...
[0:45] <vurtual> wait does it only count for erotic things, blaster?
[0:45] <blaster> No, enlarge works on anything
[0:45] <vurtual> well enlarge muscles
[0:45] <vurtual> so they become topheavy, or crush their head by speaking.
[0:46] * formlesstree4 (noemail@adsl-76-233-102-114.dsl.rcsntx.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:46] <Perry> Takos?
[0:46] <TecmagDiams> Yes
[0:46] <TecmagDiams> But that could easily backfire
[0:47] <vurtual> enlarge their blood
[0:47] <vurtual> exploding them.
[0:47] <TecmagDiams> Enlarge head, make it an easy target.
[0:47] <Perry> I just finished a thing for indev
[0:47] <Perry> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=13812
[0:47] <vurtual> or taking it from the game before df
[0:47] <vurtual> enlarge brain
[0:47] <blaster> Leomunds tiny hut, its basicly a black sphere, up to nine people can hide inside
[0:47] <vurtual> infact in that pre-DF game, magic was so op
[0:47] <blaster> Great for orgys when you dont want to be spotted
[0:47] <vurtual> since you could teleport people's insides.
[0:48] <Perry> I'm also livestreaming a demo of it
[0:48] <Perry> http://www.livestream.com/perrycraft
[0:48] <blaster> Thats the only thing I can think the tiny hut would be used for
[0:49] <vede> God the people in those blog comments are dicks.
[0:49] <vurtual> hiding goods
[0:49] <vurtual> drop a box over you in a box storage
[0:49] <vurtual> I HEAR ALARM
[0:49] <blaster> Its temporary
[0:50] <vurtual> how long
[0:50] <vurtual> flash flood watch?
[0:51] <vurtual> 2 hours per caster level!?
[0:51] <vurtual> You could hide a whole party in it.
[0:51] <blaster> And have lots of smex
[0:52] <vurtual> or jump out and unleash many sneak attacks
[0:52] <vurtual> then hide again
[0:52] <vurtual> anyways I'll probably be a fighter or rogue anyways.
[0:52] <vurtual> because attacking and sneak attacking are my favorite concepts.

[3:20] <Ickum> Yeah I was worried about that, I have a desktop and a laptop and I cant exactly leave those on all day heh
[3:20] <Visiiri> Well, there are people that have dedicated servers, but there is no specific place where you can go and pay to rent a server.
[3:20] <Nyght> WoM Servers have thier own servers
[3:20] <vurtual> desktop=yes, you can
[3:20] <shmoo> get a 2nd cheap desktop
[3:20] <shmoo> and host
[3:20] <Ickum> Yeah its a big power drain :P

[3:21] <vurtual> You cuold even argue that the amount of power turning on/off could be mroe than saved by turning it off for the night.
[3:21] <vurtual> granted someone might get out logic
[3:21] <Visiiri> I would then suggest asking around a bit.
[3:21] <Ickum> I was told at some point that that I cannot play MC whilst hosting a server on the same computer
[3:21] <Visiiri> I know people did that a while ago, but I am sure there are people that have dedicated server they will allow you to use if you pay them.
[3:22] <Ickum> I was just wondering if anyone had a recommended host that you trust and has a decent price.
[3:22] <Visiiri> And you CAN play minecraft from the same computer.
[3:22] <Visiiri> Well, I'm not completely sure about this, but I think that AndrewPH would go for it.

[3:23] <Ickum> Ah, I know of quatroking :P

[3:26] <Visiiri> *yourself.
[3:26] <Ickum> Yeah. I was pondering that
[3:26] <Ickum> I would just like a host that I could trust thats a good price.
[3:26] <Visiiri> They can be very expensive. I can't afford one, but I don't have a job.
[3:26] <Neroner> Notch is most likely have a solution to the problem when it is released.
[3:26] <Ickum> Yeah, I have a bunch of people willing to chip in
[3:26] <Ickum> I hope.
[3:26] <Neroner> Like asking a company to host MC servers
[3:26] <Visiiri> Well, they can go up to $200 a month.
[3:26] <Ickum> ouch
[3:27] <Visiiri> It's like renting a computer with a good ISP.
[3:27] <Ickum> yea...
[3:27] <Ickum> I just wish I could use the host I rent my TS3 server from XD
[3:27] <Visiiri> There are a few companies that can let you steal away with just $60/month

[4:28] <Visiiri> You were just advertizing a map that you're 'releasing'
[4:28] <Visiiri> When it was a demo map that he released
[4:28] <Visiiri> all you did was mod it.
[4:28] <blaster> Is there a problem with editing something else to make something new
[4:28] <Matthew> Yes.
[4:28] <Visiiri> And in IRC you didn't even credit him!

[4:28] <Matthew> I hate innovations.
[4:29] <Visiiri> And you edited a map minorly.
[4:29] <Matthew> but it is made by the same maker

[4:29] <riverchen> Chill.

[4:29] <Visiiri> You can't do that and release it as your own.

[5:53] <Matthew> Shadaez, Please give a detailed elaboration on why we should not have the toggle caves on and off feature in the future of minecraft.
[5:53] <waffle> becuse it makes building underground easyer
[5:53] <sorre> if you're trying to make a clean artificial cave complex, natural caves can get in the way
[5:54] <waffle> plus its more stuff you can mine.....
[5:54] <Shadaez> actually, it would be best if he had certain paramaters for the server and you could choose the chances of each feature happening
[5:54] <sorre> that's true, that would be best
[5:54] <waffle> like a toggle.......
[5:54] <sorre> but let's start simple
[5:54] <Matthew> That is your detailed elaboration?
[5:54] <sorre> caves are off, and they're about to be on
[5:54] <sorre> allowing switching between the two is easy
[5:54] <Shadaez> Matthew stfu go rickroll #Furry
[5:55] <Matthew> Wow, Is someone bitter?

[5:57] <waffle> wiremod+minecraft = FTW or WTF
[5:57] <Shadaez> i don't like the toggle idea because there are already so many types of servers that could exist, and it would devide them up again, say there are infinite map survival servers, then there would be inf map survival servers with caves, and without caves, inf map creative (will this even exist?) with and without caves, etc

[5:58] <Matthew> Thank you Shadaez for your great elaboration.
[5:58] <Shadaez> sure
[5:58] <waffle> no i havent
[5:59] <Shadaez> it's some simple 2d dogfighting game
[5:59] <Shadaez> and servers have an option of bouncy walls or not
[5:59] <sorre> >continuing to imply options are bad
[5:59] <Shadaez> it's considered "noob" to have it on by the better players, but the new players prefer it, and server owners want people in the servers
[6:00] <sorre> so the leets can get the fuck out of the nub servers
[6:00] <sorre> very simple
[6:00] <Shadaez> you act like there's an infinite number of servers, there isn't
[6:00] <Shadaez> there are so many other options in Altitude, like different game modes, level restrictions, maps, etc
[6:01] <sorre> there's technnically not an infinite number of servers in TF2, either
[6:01] <sorre> but there are damn sure enough of them
[6:01] <Shadaez> and it has become impossible for me to find a >100 ping server without bouncy walls
[6:01] <waffle> meh it really doesn't matter anyways because notch is planing to add lua "unless i've been misinformed" so there will be a huge verity in the end anyways

[7:10] <Navineous> looks pretty cool :D
[7:10] <PuyoDead> I use it on my phone pretty frequently, found some good bands.
[7:10] <Shadaez> I only scrobble to last.fm, i don't listen to it
[7:11] <PuyoDead> Well, since they shit on ipod playcounts, mine is pretty innacurate.
[7:11] <Navineous> Scrobble = ?
[7:11] <Navineous> :D
[7:11] <Navineous> Played my Favorite song from Panic! on my first try
[7:11] <Navineous> :o
[7:11] <Shadaez> PuyoDead use floola, or another ipodmanager that isn't crappy
[7:11] <LuciferZ> Flobots~
[7:11] <PuyoDead> I mean, it doesn't count existing playcounts.
[7:11] <Shadaez> Navineous basically telling Last.FM what you've listened to
[7:12] <Shadaez> PuyoDead I think floola can do that
[7:12] <PuyoDead> As in, anything counted from years prior aren't counted, only what is has been played while connected.
[7:12] <PuyoDead> Nah, that's a last.fm thing.
[7:12] <PuyoDead> They specifically state that they did that for a reason.
[7:12] <Shadaez> floola updates my Last.FM account every time I open it
[7:12] <PuyoDead> They consider it "cheating", and you can only do it once for a new account.
[7:12] <Navineous> Only problem with this is that it's a video...

[8:29] <EmpiresBane> people are dumb?
[8:29] <Varriount> ^^^ that's the bug
[8:30] <Kodaichi> Notch should have changed Survival Test into what /indev is right now
[8:30] <EmpiresBane> Varriount, it's not a bug, it a feature
[8:30] <EmpiresBane> Kodaichi, no.
[8:30] <Varriount> Yes!
[8:30] <EmpiresBane> Survival Test is free
[8:30] <Kodaichi> there's no reason for him not to, there's nothing wrong with it

[10:43] <vede> So, in your (that is, everyone here right now) opinions, if you had to put the three major consoles (Wii, PS3, XBox360) on a scale of 'hardcoreness' where would you put them? Note that I don't mean to use game library here, I want you to use the "hardcoreness" of the consoles' largest consumer demographic.
[10:43] <Darkfire002> yes
[10:43] <Darkfire002> so do i
[10:43] <vede> I'm thinking Wii -> XBox 360 -> PS3
[10:43] <Shadaez> pc ps3 360 wii
[10:43] <Shadaez> then macs
[10:43] <Darkfire002> xbox ps3 wii
[10:44] <Darkfire002> pc first

[10:44] <Marach> i meant 360
[10:44] <wry> just say no to consoles
[10:44] <Marach> ofc
[10:44] <Shadaez> attitudes?
[10:44] <Darkfire002> lets go back to minecraft...
[10:44] <Darkfire002> its not mcchatter,
[10:44] <Shadaez> mac, 360, pc, ps3, wii
[10:45] <Dommys> It's BUTTER YA'LL
[10:45] <vede> Like, you have three guys. One is playing with flowers, one is talking about guns, and the other is shooting someone. If you had to take those three people and attach them to those three consoles, how would it go?
[10:45] <Shadaez> well, flower is on PS3
[10:45] <Dommys> Wii Ps3, 360
[10:45] <Marach> lol
[10:46] <vede> (I want to know because I was inspired by a forum thread, and I'm making Minecraft box art for each of the three, and I want to have differing levels of extravagance on each.
[10:46] <Marach> lol box art
[10:47] <vede> I already have the Wii one done. (Just a side-view of the top part of a cave, with a dude's head and a pickaxe in it, daytime.)
[10:47] <Dommys> I would say that the average wii gamer is either into flowers, or just pretty colors.. the average ps3 gamer is totally into talking about the FEATURES involved with their choice.. and the 360 user is more bound to just be shooting/killing someone
[10:47] <Marach> hm, i can't close grooveshark
[10:47] <Darkfire002> wii ps3 360
[10:47] <Marach> Dommys: a wii gamer is into GAMEPLAY.

[10:47] <Marach> i don't care if it's guns, flowers or tapeworms
[10:47] <Shadaez> i think ps3 is the best console, but i enjoy 360 more because i know more people who have one
[10:48] <vede> Dommys, from your general tone there, I think you might be a bit biased.
[10:48] <Dommys> "Waggle to jump" "Waggle to move" "Waggle to dodge" "Waggle to dance"
[10:48] <Marach> and fps on wii are epic.
[10:48] <Dommys> I have a wii and a 360.
[10:48] <Dommys> I play neither.
[10:48] <vede> You guys.
[10:48] <Dommys> :D
[10:48] <vede> Shut up about your console wars.
[10:48] <outsomnia> hey gais, Lair was a good game, right?
[10:48] <Marach> vede has a point
[10:48] <wry> i eat all consoles
[10:48] <Dommys> vede, really though, I'm not biased. I hate all three consoles and their general userbase equally.
[10:49] <vede> I just wanted to get a general idea for how extreme each of the three groups were.
[10:49] <outsomnia> And ya, enough about console wars, lets talk about iphone games.
[10:49] <Darkfire002> hell level, uve got a iron sword, and iron armor, with 2 spiders, a skelly firing an arrow, a zombie on the left pretty close, and a big stone fortress in the background.
[10:49] <outsomnia> Wait, I've or you've?
[10:49] <Darkfire002> im not biased, ive played both a bit, and im completely torn.
[10:49] <Darkfire002> who likes my idea for 360?
[10:49] <Darkfire002> hell level, uve got a iron sword, and iron armor, with 2 spiders, a skelly firing an arrow, a zombie on the left pretty close, and a big stone fortress in the background.

[10:50] <vurtual> Yes we are Dommys
[10:50] <vurtual> flailing a controller around is fun.
[10:50] <vurtual> Instead of ragedly throwing it, you are already flinging it. It's hard to get mad.
[10:50] <Marach> lol true
[10:51] <vede> My Wii box art. Very simple, intentionally so. http://i.imgur.com/9rD7h.png
[10:51] <Marach> who cares about userbase, i'm playing it alone
[10:51] <Dommys> I just don't get why wii players argue that the wii is poorly designed and the control scheme is completely just a gimmick?
[10:51] <Marach> vurtual: lacks a tree of flowers
[10:52] <Dommys> I've played more than a few wii games.. I have a modded console, with a drive full of roms.. most of them are terribad.
[10:52] <vurtual> vede that will never work
[10:52] <vurtual> too lame.
[10:52] <outsomnia> @ marach not enough processing power for it
[10:52] <Dommys> If you build it, they will grow!

[11:04] <Marach> do make flash thingies
[11:04] <vurtual> actually I should do this in EP2
[11:05] <Marach> omg spoilers
[11:05] <vurtual> Since HL2 may just have incredibly dull settings to look like it used to or something.
[11:05] <Marach> do that in ep3

[11:05] <Shadaez> flash sucks and you could easily do it in javascript in 5 seconds
[11:05] <vurtual> There are few actual nice graphical looking spots in EP2, because they threw them together a bit cheaply.
[11:06] <vurtual> I could also do it as the world's most ridiculously massive image, Shadaez.

[11:17] <vurtual> except that it'd be a pain
[11:17] <Marach> draw the image on canvas pixel by pixel :3
[11:17] <carllll> gdude
[11:17] <gdude2002> Yes.
[11:17] <vurtual> okay I have this awesome idea of just uploading the two screenshots, then you can tab between them.
[11:17] <carllll> remember me :D?
[11:17] <vurtual> easier on me.
[11:17] <gdude2002> carllll: Remotely. :P
[11:17] <Marach> how to switch between tabs with keyboard?
[11:18] <gdude2002> Shirt+Tab?
[11:18] <gdude2002> Shift*
[11:18] <Shadaez> shirt
[11:18] <Marach> lol
[11:18] <gdude2002> lol

[11:18] <vurtual> uploading them both now
[11:18] * gdude2002 wears a hoodie
[11:18] <Marach> mice are overrated
[11:19] <vurtual> not really
[11:19] <gdude2002> Handy though.
[11:19] * vurtual points at you
[11:19] <Marach> shirt+tab does nothing
[11:19] * gdude2002 double-clicks on Marach's delete button
[11:19] <gdude2002> lolk
[11:19] <Marach> it only scrolls down
[11:19] <gdude2002> Depends ont eh app
[11:19] * vurtual pulls on his shirt's random little tab
[11:19] <gdude2002> on the*
[11:19] <vurtual> There we go, changed tabs
[11:19] <Marach> like tab alone
[11:19] <gdude2002> xD
[11:19] <gdude2002> hmm

[11:35] <Shadaez> i just made that up, but I'm sure there are

[11:35] <Shadaez> i remember an old dos space game that I think had an infinite area
[11:35] <Mugendai> Daggerfall?
[11:35] <Mugendai> wait
[11:35] <Shadaez> in space :O
[11:35] <Mugendai> didn't see "space" in there, lo
[11:36] <Mugendai> l
[11:36] <Mugendai> Daggerfall was on my mind, as that holds the world record for biggest game world, last I checked
[11:37] <Shadaez> Eve's bigger than Minecraft
[11:38] <Darkfire002> eve?
[11:38] <Mugendai> haven't played that, but
[11:38] <Darkfire002> but minecraft is infinite
[11:38] <Mugendai> makes sense I suppose
[11:38] <Shadaez> no it's not
[11:38] <Darkfire002> how is eve bigger than infinite
[11:39] <Darkfire002> there is an end to infinite maps?
[11:39] <Mugendai> There's a limit to the size of Infdev
[11:39] <Mugendai> Computational restrictions

[11:40] <Shadaez> I'm currently making a
[11:40] <Shadaez> 100x100 KM game world for my GTA2 clone
[11:40] <Shadaez> which is decently large
[11:41] <Darkfire002> morrowind was a pretty big game world, but it didnt fill that game world with anything, it didnt matter. minecraft makes use of its space
[11:41] <Darkfire002> if a player makes use of it
[11:41] <Darkfire002> prettymuch its all as usefull as the player makes it
[11:41] <Shadaez> daggerfall is much larger than morrowind
[11:42] <Mugendai> Daggerfall is about as big as the British Isles iirc
[11:42] <Dommys> saying that eve online is a bigger game is stupid
[11:42] <Marach> infdev is a bigger game
[11:42] <Dommys> Those ships move at ridiculously huge speeds across huge areas
[11:42] <Shadaez> it's still larger
[11:43] <Dommys> You can't compare them though
[11:43] <Dommys> I mean, fuck.. I could make a minecraft clone, and resize every block to 6m each instead of 3m and say "MYCLONE IS BIGGER"
[11:44] <Dommys> Eve has more content though :D

[12:24] <Visiiri> Prototype is a pretty lame game, but I enjoy it.
[12:25] <Visiiri> The characters are little more than textures and the graphics are, well, not that great
[12:25] <vede> The funnest games are usually pretty lame.
[12:25] <Visiiri> Yup.
[12:25] <vede> Well, "lame."
[12:25] <Visiiri> I mean, I just leaped over a tank, hijacked a helecopter, and was taken out by a giant zombie
[12:25] <Visiiri> It can't get more epic than that
[12:25] <vurtual> Just Cause 2.
[12:26] <vede> I mean, I'm pretty sure that to a huge portion of gamers today, Minecraft looks like the most lame-ass shit you could possibly play, other than crap like Dora the Explorer: The Game: The Movie: The Game
[12:26] <Visiiri> You're comparing ice to a sword.
[12:26] <vurtual> Commiting grand theft auto of a tank from a high-security military base singlehandedly, then getting in a carchase with it, blowing up motorcycles
[12:26] <vede> Minecraft
[12:26] <vurtual> Then fighting a helicopter, fighting MORE helicopters, raiding a few cities, grappling onto a helicopter, throwing out everyone inside, shooting down the other helicopters with it.
[12:27] <vede> Committing epic castle-building, blowing up the ground.
[12:27] <vurtual> every final boss is more epic than the last, too.
[12:28] <vede> Also, I can't come up with something that's more hardcore than a nice day mining, but less hardcore than a dark-toned image of a creeper with a massive explosion backlight.
[12:28] <vede> (That I'd be willing to do.)

[12:29] <vede> And I don't think I just want to do an X360 cover that's just a logo with some images behind it.
[12:29] <vede> 'Cuz then it just wouldn't shine between the Wii one and the PS3 one.
[12:29] <Chocolatey_Syrup> ...right then~
[12:29] <vede> Chocolatey_Syrup, no bets, but it probably will.
[12:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Well I mean
[12:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> It's been pushed back a bunch already
[12:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I sort of wish he'd stagger his updates a bit. You know, one update for signs, one for doors and ladders maybe
[12:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> But I'm sure it'll come through eventually
[12:30] <vurtual> Some wizard spells are silly.
[12:30] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Just, you know, now that it's being worked on again all that old anticipation is back :D

[15:02] <vurtual> 'cept like food.
[15:02] <vurtual> and decent TV
[15:02] <Icenisse> uh
[15:02] <Icenisse> wat?
[15:02] <Dommys> Icenisse do you have a 2 line chat log? READ ABOVE THIS TEXT
[15:02] <vurtual> I don't "hang out" with anyone, so I'd just have to occasionally police my screening room and vehicle garage.
[15:03] <Dommys> I'm not retyping the question when you can look 5 lines above you to read the damned thing
[15:03] <Icenisse> actually only 3 lines

[15:04] <vurtual> while his name is German
[15:04] <vurtual> accidentally signed an insulting piece of paper
[15:04] <vurtual> Jonas brothers are those freaky kids
[15:04] <Plinky> Vurtual, also swore at an adult.
[15:04] <vurtual> oh no
[15:04] <Dommys> So?
[15:04] <vurtual> oh no
[15:04] <Dommys> Fuck that adult.
[15:04] <vurtual> he swore
[15:04] <vurtual> we're gonna be poor
[15:04] <Dommys> He should get out of J-bee's way
[15:04] <Plinky> There was a big uproar about it.
[15:04] <Plinky> :P
[15:04] <vurtual> guys we have to have the adult cancel the hearing
[15:05] <Dommys> J-bee does and says what J-bee wants
[15:05] <vurtual> besides all of them would probably be really creeped out by me and just live in whatever human habitable rooms the are, and hope I'm not in them.
[15:05] <Dommys> Adults betta know.
[15:05] <Dommys> Vurtual, I like you.
[15:05] <Dommys> Is that ok?
[15:05] <vurtual> Everyone does.
[15:05] <Dommys> Actually I lied.
[15:05] <vurtual> Until they see me cleanly jump accross a large kitchen in one calm spring.
[15:06] <Icenisse> O.o
[15:06] <vurtual> not even my family can cope with that.
[15:06] <Dommys> I don't get what you're saying.. your family is creeped out by your jumping ability?

[15:06] <vurtual> Yes.
[15:06] <Icenisse> wb
[15:06] <vurtual> How big accross is your room?
[15:06] <Dommys> Or are they creeped out that you do it constantly because of the "lava floor"
[15:06] <Icenisse> now snow is it time to tell me?
[15:06] <Snowman> Nope
[15:06] <vurtual> Well, Dommys? How big?
[15:06] <Icenisse> when will it be?
[15:06] <Dommys> I have 4 rooms in 1200 square foot apartment
[15:06] <Dommys> I don't know exactly
[15:06] <vurtual> room you're in now, guess.
[15:07] <Snowman> Soon.
[15:07] <vurtual> Well, imagine someone jumping say, twice your height, or 1.5 or so
[15:07] <Icenisse> define soon
[15:07] <Dommys> Film it.
[15:07] <Snowman> In the upcoming time
[15:07] <vurtual> in one low jump
[15:07] <Icenisse> like when?
[15:07] <Dommys> For what, though
[15:07] <vurtual> and they just spring to everywhere.
[15:07] <Dommys> Why are you jumping the kitchen?
[15:07] <vurtual> because it's faster than walking.
[15:07] <Snowman> In the time that is ahead.
[15:07] <Icenisse> bawt I wanna know nooooow
[15:07] <Icenisse> D:
[15:07] <Dommys> I do weird stuff, also
[15:08] <vurtual> landing stops me instantly, rather than running, which can only be stopped so quickly. Additionally, fridge to dew storage and back is fast.
[15:08] <Dommys> So wait
[15:08] <Dommys> You're leaping to get caffeine.
[15:08] <vurtual> Mountain dew is delicious.
[15:08] <Dommys> I think that might be your problem.
[15:08] <Icenisse> snow will it be within 100 days?
[15:08] <Plinky> Vurtual, the landing stops you instantly, with damage to parts of your feet and legs. I would prefer walking.
[15:09] <Dommys> too much leaping for caffeine leading to more caffeine and more caffeine
[15:09] <vurtual> Yes, I've been doing such jumping for decades, plinky.
[15:09] <Dommys> DECADES
[15:09] <vurtual> Landing from a jump is not going to break your legs.
[15:09] <Dommys> JUMPING
[15:09] <Dommys> It can, Vurt
[15:09] <Plinky> No, but it damages your joints.
[15:09] <Snowman> Maybe, maybe not.
[15:09] <Dommys> Probably not the jump you're doing, atleast without some serious bad luck
[15:09] <Icenisse> :<
[15:09] <vurtual> Slamming into pavement at high speed didn't, landing won't either.
[15:09] <wry> everything damages something

[16:54] <Azathoth> yeah. because people don't worship notch enough already right
[16:54] <gdude2002|away> and I can make it post to his Twitter
[16:55] <gdude2002|away> yes yes good good?
[16:55] <Ten_Tacles> Notch is a deity of Minecraft. Notch most often takes the form of a blocky guy and is associated with awesomeness.

[17:04] <Azathoth> is it just me or are oranges really fucking tasty?

[17:05] <gdude2002|away> yesyes
[17:05] <gdude2002|away> I agree
[17:05] <bildramer> ^^
[17:05] <gdude2002|away> +1
[17:05] <vurtual> You know, when thinking about it, how does a wizard's intelligence affect spellpower?
[17:05] <vurtual> Does their brain have to calculate the magic?
[17:05] <Azathoth> i wish they required less effort to eat. i'd eat them for every meal
[17:05] <Azathoth> but you have to peel them and then that annoying skin doesn't come off all the way
[17:06] <Azathoth> and sometimes they have seeds even if they're not supposed to
[17:06] <vurtual> oranges are delicious and easy to peel with your hands
[17:06] <Azathoth> and they squirt everywhere
[17:06] <vurtual> you just have to be awesome at it
[17:06] <vurtual> then they pull apart easily and it's om nom nom, with a bit of crunch
[17:06] <gdude2002|away> crunch?
[17:06] <Azathoth> i guess it depends on the orange though
[17:06] <gdude2002|away> lolwut
[17:06] <Azathoth> i wouldn't call it a crunch
[17:06] <Azathoth> but they certainly are squishy
[17:06] <gdude2002|away> More of a squelch.
[17:07] <gdude2002|away> :P
[17:07] <Azathoth> yeah
[17:07] <bildramer> vurtual, they must be able to read stuff
[17:07] <vurtual> You'd think it'd be something like constitution, drawing on their physical durability, or wisdom, drawing on their will.
[17:07] <bildramer> and learn how to do it, and not forget etc.
[17:07] <bildramer> see: cursed scrolls of genocide
[17:07] <gdude2002|away> xD
[17:07] <Azathoth> intelligence is like a measure of mental capacity

[17:07] <gdude2002|away> Well done.

[17:07] <Azathoth> i mean

[17:08] <Azathoth> probably wouldn't be a very good spellcaster
[17:08] <gdude2002|away> derp.
[17:08] <gdude2002|away> :P
[17:08] <Azathoth> they don't have the mental integrity for it.
[17:08] <vurtual> It's not like they're complex actions.
[17:08] <vurtual> and you don't risk forgetting spells if your int is low.
[17:08] <Azathoth> yes but the spells are probably channeled by your mind or whatever
[17:09] <Azathoth> i doubt they rely only on the proper movements and chants
[17:09] <vurtual> yet somehow, thinking hard enough can cause effects independant of you to be different.
[17:09] <Azathoth> it's a power within
[17:09] <vurtual> That'd be wisdom.
[17:09] <gdude2002|away> xD
[17:09] <vurtual> Maybe being a wizard requires you being an OCD-ish nerd
[17:10] <Azathoth> clearly you've never cast a spell in real life
[17:10] <vurtual> and they constantly think of things, so they have to be smart to quickly solve and do away with them, lest they be distracted?

[17:50] <vurtual> While in reality, wizards can quickly harness a massive amount of magical abilities, and sorcerors can unleash constant magical assault.
[17:51] <vurtual> Rogues can disarm traps, pick locks, and dodge about everything.
[17:51] <Szoltomi> Altough I somewhat miss the major difference between say a melee fighter, paladin, ranger and rogue, apart from the few bonuses (like what you just said about rogues)
[17:52] * darky is now known as darky|Away
[17:52] <Szoltomi> I understand though a lot in dungeons is not about fighting, but that part seemed to lack depth, there are very few class-specific active combat skills (talking about melee)
[17:52] <vurtual> Paladins are lawful good, can preform some clerical spells if they have the ability score for it, can do things like smite evil and detect evil, turn undead(as in, make them turn in their graves ahurhurr)
[17:53] <Szoltomi> Yeah, I know :P played a paladin to about level 4, and a melee ranger to 5 or 6, (melee because I realised ranged fighting is terribly weak)
[17:53] <vurtual> http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Paladin#Class_Features mostpart correct
[17:53] <vurtual> and ranged fighting is massively powerful if you know what weapons to use
[17:54] <vurtual> heavy repeating crossbows are really, really ridiculously powerful, even for a fighter not built to use them, they're still the second most powerful thing short of a greataxe.
[17:54] * asnoehu (thok@cc64025-c.hnglo1.ov.home.nl) has joined #minecraft
[17:54] <Szoltomi> but they are slow, aren't them?
[17:54] <vurtual> repeating
[17:54] <vurtual> 3 shots at once
[17:54] <vurtual> a single reload, three more shots.
[17:55] <vurtual> That means if you take the exotic weapon proficiency for them, you can hit a target 3 times, or whatever selection of targets, before they can let off one shot.
[17:55] * darky|Away (dark@c-66-177-248-172.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[17:55] <vurtual> Three different 1d10 hits are not to be trifled with.
[17:56] <Szoltomi> I didn't really seem to get one of those in the early game though, only bows, which do about the same damage as my melee weapons, just twice as slow...
[17:56] <vurtual> You can buy them.
[17:56] <vurtual> They're not common loot.
[17:56] <Szoltomi> yeah, but if there are a pack of enemies, even if I take one of them out quicky, I'm gimped if the reload is slow
[17:56] <vurtual> It's not much compared to triply-firing, and there's rapid reload.

[17:57] <vurtual> An assault rifle, of greataxes.
[17:58] <Szoltomi> Anyway, I don't know if I want to devote time to rearrange the feats of my tempest, with two +3 weapons I think, especially since I stopped playing months ago, because the very few available quests
[17:59] <vurtual> It's way better now.
[17:59] <vurtual> though I know i'll probably eventually get bored of it.
[17:59] <vurtual> Eventually.
[17:59] <Szoltomi> Yeah, back then ranged was lackluster, maybe something was changed, which I don't know of
[17:59] <gdude2002|away> Never thought it'd be so hard to talk to a French person when they play ingame on Archives lol
[17:59] <vurtual> it's still horrible if you have no idea what you're doing.
[18:00] <vurtual> Though, figuring out what you're doing is emphasizing dexterity in your magical gear, and then getting above heavy weapons.
[18:00] <Szoltomi> it doesn't seem so complex, exotic weap. prof., rapid reload, reloading heavy Xbow
[18:00] <Szoltomi> I see
[18:00] <vurtual> I don't have rapid reload
[18:01] <vurtual> or quite the dex emphasis to actually use it better than melee outright.

[18:03] <vurtual> or wether to have a fighter, or ranger.

[18:39] <Icenisse> uh
[18:39] <eightbit> So its like

[18:39] <eightbit> :(
[18:39] <vurtual> good try though :D

[18:40] <eightbit> were not so different you and I
[18:40] <eightbit> I'm also a dude
[18:40] <eightbit> and I have a name
[18:40] <Icenisse> I cannot do any kind of magic spell
[18:41] <Icenisse> but
[18:41] <vurtual> I'm not a dude
[18:41] <vurtual> But I also have a name
[18:41] <vurtual> We should have a threesome.
[18:41] <eightbit> iceman doesn't use magic
[18:41] <eightbit> he uses genetics
[18:41] <Icenisse> well I still cant do any thing like that
[18:41] <eightbit> he is the master race
[18:41] <Icenisse> I can cut you if you are evil
[18:41] <vurtual> Niac's Cold Ray would suck as an inherent ability.
[18:41] <SnowmanHTC> You can be frozen
[18:41] <eightbit> WITH ICE?
[18:41] <Icenisse> hmm
[18:41] <vurtual> I mean really, a saving roll against your only attack?
[18:41] <eightbit> So
[18:41] <Icenisse> I could cut you and fill the hole with water
[18:41] <Icenisse> and then freeze you
[18:42] <Icenisse> so the water gets to ice
[18:42] <Icenisse> and expands
[18:42] <Icenisse> and kills you
[18:42] <eightbit> Iceman totally went from one of the weakest xmen to one of the most powerful
[18:42] <Icenisse> >:3
[18:42] <eightbit> over the course of the comics
[18:42] <vurtual> Congradulations, you can zap people for 1d10 damage per your level!
[18:42] <vurtual> Oh sweet!
[18:42] <vurtual> But they can easily do a saving roll against it.
[18:42] <vurtual> :(
[18:42] <Ten_Tacles> Meh
[18:42] <eightbit> In the original comic his only ability was to pack snow around him at command, so that he looked like a snowman, and when someone punched him, it would hurt slightly less because the snow would take the impact
[18:43] <Icenisse> ten why are you v+?
[18:43] <vurtual> Congradulations, your enemy has taken no damage from you expanding most of your spells for the day.
[18:43] <vurtual> What kinda lame power is "laser beam, of cold, that can accidentally miss." anyways
[18:43] <eightbit> Now he has complete control over every molecule of water in his vicinity, and can reconstruct himself after any attack, so long as one water molecue exists
[18:43] <vurtual> nerf iceman
[18:43] <Ten_Tacles> Because I'm cool.
[18:44] <Icenisse> no, really
[18:44] <Icenisse> why?

[19:01] <Quatroking> you know
[19:01] <Ten_Tacles> Ye
[19:01] <Ten_Tacles> Nice idea.
[19:01] <Ten_Tacles> Me like.
[19:01] <Quatroking> No need for shop NPC's
[19:01] <Quatroking> no sirree

[19:02] <vurtual> like, a diamond.
[19:02] <Quatroking> you just build your magical terminal 2000 and buy stuff off ikea
[19:02] <vurtual> Those are apparently a magical super-ore and not a game
[19:02] <vurtual> gem*
[19:02] <vurtual> So use 27 iron, some stone, and a diamond.
[19:02] <SnowmanHTC> Also, why petd, this aint maplestory
[19:02] <vurtual> Which then is encrusted into the device, and is holographic :D
[19:02] <Quatroking> snowman: livestock
[19:02] <vurtual> And displays crude stock information or whatever
[19:02] <Quatroking> instant trading buying selling is also not possible, as the thing requires coal to power its magical link
[19:03] <vurtual> maybe we could build wires.
[19:03] <Quatroking> transferring goods goes at the speed of melting shit

[19:04] <vurtual> hasn't gone out yet
[19:04] <Azathoth> does it matter which way you put it in?
[19:04] <vurtual> hasn't gone out yet, I have no idea.
[19:04] <Azathoth> ><
[19:04] <Ten_Tacles> Notch, give us updates.
[19:04] <Quatroking> "oh i want to buy some color cloth so I can decorate my fort, lets buy some stuff over at minekea" **runs off to his magical terminal**
[19:04] <Ten_Tacles> Naow.
[19:04] <Azathoth> notch isn't here
[19:04] <vurtual> so would magical wires be a good idea?
[19:04] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[19:04] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[19:04] <Ten_Tacles> Ye
[19:05] <Ten_Tacles> Everytrhing magical
[19:05] <Quatroking> vurtual, I guess
[19:05] <Ten_Tacles> Magical crap.
[19:05] <Azathoth> magical penises
[19:05] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[19:05] <Quatroking> it'd be a real mess tho
[19:05] <Takos360> well, NotchBot is here, ask him xD
[19:05] <Quatroking> Hm
[19:05] <vurtual> they'd be towers I guess.
[19:05] <Chocolatey_Syrup> ...still no update, huh? :I
[19:05] <Ten_Tacles> Magical carp.
[19:05] <SnowmanHTC> Quatroking, livestock aren't pets, stop living on a farm
[19:05] <ZomBuster> I don't think its a bad idea
[19:05] <Quatroking> what about have the transfer speed rely on distance?
[19:05] <ZomBuster> but i would rather have trains

[19:06] <Knuckx117> o.o
[19:06] <Knuckx117> heh
[19:06] <Quatroking> the magical terminal would eliminate any shop NPC problems
[19:06] <vurtual> you'd have to support them somehow, or they'd be entity towers of stone and wood, with something on top, and they'd laser together.
[19:06] <vurtual> glowing brightly when something is in transit.
[19:06] <Azathoth> traincraft
[19:06] <vurtual> maybe people too
[19:06] <SnowmanHTC> I prefer TM's :D
[19:06] <ZomBuster> altough I suppose it would be too slow for a lot of items
[19:06] * Quatroking facepalm
[19:06] <Quatroking> Snowman, harvest moon
[19:06] <Takos360> Minecraft could actually have boats
[19:06] <Takos360> if Notch wanted to
[19:06] <Azathoth> harvest sex
[19:06] <vurtual> I want to create a laser transport network for people
[19:06] <ZomBuster> so a train with ~5 wagons and each with 1 chest capacity would be better
[19:06] <Azathoth> i loved the original harvest moon. it was so fun
[19:06] <Azathoth> harvest moon 64 was pretty good too
[19:07] <Quatroking> I liked harvest moon on the GBC

[19:07] <Takos360> what IS harvest moon? :P
[19:07] <ZomBuster> farming game
[19:07] <vurtual> Then be like "Just jump into this little glowy hologram powered by DIAMONDS, and pick your destination, and you'll zoom off!
[19:07] <Takos360> Ah ok
[19:07] <Quatroking> vurtual: how would lasers fit in the steampunk fantasy theme, tho?
[19:08] <ZomBuster> 1 diamond per teleport sounds like a good price
[19:08] <vurtual> Holograms and lasers generally fit in steampunk fairly well.
[19:08] <Quatroking> I think speed accordng to distance would work better
[19:08] <Azathoth> i'm not sure minecraft is very steampunk
[19:08] <ZomBuster> MAGIC holograms and MAGIC teleports
[19:08] <Quatroking> Azathoth: Notch is going towards fantasy steampunk
[19:08] <Azathoth> well that's cool
[19:08] <vurtual> with the power of diamonds, being magical.
[19:08] <Azathoth> i guess with the gears (wahtever the hell they do) and the possibility of minecarts i can see it
[19:08] <Quatroking> its mostly steampunk but instead of a shitload of brass, we'd be using wood and stone
[19:09] <Quatroking> maintaining the machine stuff
[19:09] <vurtual> ancientpunk?
[19:09] <Quatroking> fantasy steampunk
[19:09] <vurtual> how fast can information travel via only gears anyways?
[19:09] <Azathoth> steamfantasy
[19:09] <Quatroking> considering we have coals

[19:10] <vurtual> Hmm, fantasy steampunk setting
[19:10] <Ten_Tacles> Bored
[19:10] <Azathoth> no, becasue the most gears you add, the more torque you need to apply
[19:10] <vurtual> not far from the world of Eberron eh
[19:10] <Quatroking> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=12744
[19:10] <Ten_Tacles> Any idea what I could do?

[19:10] <Ten_Tacles> Hm
[19:10] <Ten_Tacles> Maybe
[19:10] <Azathoth> that's a sound idea
[19:10] <Ten_Tacles> Other ideas?
[19:10] <Quatroking> uh
[19:11] <vurtual> roll 4d6 6 times and drop the lowest number, Ten_Tacles
[19:11] <Quatroking> collect 900 HD wallpapers
[19:11] <Azathoth> masturbate...
[19:11] <Ten_Tacles> WHhat
[19:11] <Azathoth> another man
[19:11] <vurtual> KILL 6 HD WALLPAPERS AND BRING ME THEIR BACKGROUNDS
[19:11] <Azathoth> vurtual please don't tell me ddo does that kind of shit :|
[19:11] <Quatroking> or just discuss the Magical terminal 2000

[19:12] <Quatroking> now with more sparkly power
[19:12] <vurtual> It's legendarily funny.
[19:12] <Azathoth> but seriously vurtual
[19:12] <Azathoth> think about it
[19:12] <Azathoth> you can't turn a gear if the gear it's attached to doesn't also turn
[19:12] <vurtual> anyways if minecraft giant cities end up looking like Stormreach then I am fully supportive of this.
[19:12] <Azathoth> so that means while you're turning one gear, the next gear has to turn and the next gear and the next gear and so on
[19:13] <Azathoth> have you ever seen a mechanical computer or anything?
[19:13] <vurtual> I wasn't serious
[19:13] <Quatroking> I think I prefer wireless transfer between the terminals
[19:13] <Quatroking> it would save me a shitload of resources
[19:13] <Azathoth> i prefer penises
[19:13] <Quatroking> also it would kind of defeat the savety purpose of not having to travel across field, encountering monsters
[19:14] <Azathoth> what would?
[19:14] <Quatroking> having to build wires
[19:15] <Takos360> wireless transfer and trading would kill minecraft, and notch's soul
[19:15] <Azathoth> you should definitely have to build wires
[19:15] <Azathoth> but if he's gonna do the steampunk thing they might as well be neumatic tubes or something
[19:15] <vurtual> fast transfer via pylons

[19:17] <Takos360> tubes that transport shit
[19:17] <Takos360> very popular on the 90's
[19:17] <ZomBuster> or cannons
[19:17] <ZomBuster> that shoot stuff
[19:17] <Takos360> lol xD
[19:17] <Azathoth> and in banks

[21:43] <Azathoth> uh
[21:43] <Azathoth> you must have a different definition of the word than i do
[21:43] <Azathoth> because where i come from awesome is usually a good thing
[21:43] <vurtual> I fill people with awe.
[21:43] <Azathoth> i think that look on their faces is disgust more than awe
[21:44] <vurtual> Capible at many things, born a good shot, tough, determined, and agile.
[21:44] <Azathoth> not as good of a shot as me
[21:45] <Azathoth> i can hit a running deer at 1000m with a smoothbore flint-lock pistol
[21:45] <vurtual> No, you cannot.

[21:45] <vurtual> Deer running at 1000m? Why exactly 1000m?
[21:46] <Azathoth> because that's a kilometer
[21:46] <EmpiresBane> i can hit a deer running at 1000m with a snot rocket
[21:46] <Azathoth> i could probalby shoot further
[21:46] <vurtual> Despite all your insultive accusations, I am still awesome, they do nothing.
[21:46] <Azathoth> but with somewhat less accuracy
[21:46] <ZomBuster> the flintlock pistol had a laster sight with distance indicator
[21:46] <liq3> Azathoth: pfft. I can hit a dear on the otherside of the planet traveling at terminal velocity with a pebble.
[21:46] <rcfighter> Hes clearly insane, and he brings a pistol to the grocery store and shoots randomly into the frozen food section.
[21:46] <Azathoth> liq3 is a fuckin liar
[21:46] <liq3> Pfft.
[21:46] <vurtual> more believable
[21:46] <EmpiresBane> i on the other hand, was telling the truth
[21:46] <vurtual> beause terminal velocity means you cover a massive amount of area.

[21:47] <Azathoth> wait what
[21:48] <vurtual> okay bond is now seducing a chick on the ferris wheel he arranged to be disabled.

[21:48] <rcfighter> ...There isn't much left, though
[21:48] <vurtual> using his massive supernumeary ears.
[21:49] <Azathoth> i can hit a running deer at 200m with an MMORPG
[21:49] <shairn> I can hit an RPG traveling at 200 miles an hour with a deer
[21:49] <SnowmanHTC> I can't hit a deer. :(

[21:52] <shairn> if you put a bag of striking in a bag of striking
[21:52] <liq3> The bag part is because you keep the chips in bags when ye play. o.o

[21:53] <liq3> off*
[21:53] <shairn> meh boring
[21:53] <liq3> i know right?
[21:53] <vurtual> the bag will continue to attempt to expend energy from the inner surface until it is exhausted of immediate charge
[21:53] <shairn> there's no space-time deficiency
[21:53] <vurtual> then, the other bag of striking will be in a very charged environment

[23:58] <vurtual> then every time he wakes up, smack his head into the wall again.
[23:58] <vurtual> then play it in high speed for anyone who may threaten me.
