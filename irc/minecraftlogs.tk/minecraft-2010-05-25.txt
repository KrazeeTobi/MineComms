[023] ZaxKellensSS Oh, weird

[025] AzureAngelic ive seen plenty
[025] AzureAngelic but they tend to be really small
[026] Firetempest yeah, they are artifacts from large cliffs
[026] AzureAngelic you can make an artificial island
[026] AzureAngelic but its really hard
[026] blaster If you go down to the bottom of the sea
[027] blaster Instead of floating dirt
[027] ZaxKellensSS A lake that floats above the land...
[028] ZaxKellensSS That's not a man's romance
[030] vurtual that's a floating lake
[030] vurtual What did you expect it to be
[030] ZaxKellensSS More fun
[031] vurtual And why hasn't my friend appeared on the internet all day

[032] Quatroking httpwww.minecraftforum.netviewtopic.phpp=218466#p218466
[032] vurtual or maybe he's moving or something, or broke his internet
[032] vurtual or is upgrading
[033] ZaxKellensSS Or he is stuck in the site
[033] vurtual Because we stopped growing, that's why.
[033] vurtual Just keep growing, durr.
[033] Dommys [1632] ZaxKellensSS Or an hero ; This happened to me once
[033] PuyoDead I just love the obsession our forums have with this pseudo intellectual religious stuff that just has to be brought up every couple weeks.
[034] Quatroking Puyodead doesn't that happen on every board these days
[035] PuyoDead Not as bad as ours.
[035] PuyoDead And not with as many half-informed kids.
[035] PuyoDead (half being generous)
[035] Quatroking Religion seems to be dying a bit too, pretty much everyone besides the muslim bitches in my school is atheist
[035] PuyoDead A lot of kids go through that. Not all of them stick with it.
[036] AzureAngelic god damnit i hate vampire bats
[036] ZaxKellensSS That's because people are getting smarter and realizing that religion is crap
[036] Quatroking puyodead I don't call 17 to 23-year olds kids
[036] PuyoDead You just see if more in young people, who still think rebelion is cool.
[036] Dommys Quatro of course you don't.
[036] Dommys But the rest of the world does.
[036] Quatroking meh
[037] Dommys My 3 year old nephew says Uncle Dommys, I is not a kid..
[037] ZaxKellensSS 1-22 = kids to me
[037] Quatroking then again we're IT students
[037] Dommys And that is implying
[037] Quatroking could that be a reason why we're all fuck religion, give me some damn proof first these days
[038] ZaxKellensSS I like proof
[038] ZaxKellensSS That's why religion is crap
[038]  Quatroking notices something strange about his hardware sensors
[038] PuyoDead Well, a lot of that has to do with people not being pressured into thinking religiously.
[038] blaster Yeh, More proof we are getting clever is the higher the number of people following cristianity, the higher the global intelligence level is
[038] Quatroking why is my CPU fan running 600 rpm higher than normal
[038] blaster Which is why we had the dark ages
[039] blaster Quatroking did you change your BIOS settings
[039] Quatroking Haven't done that in weeks
[039] TkTechAway Quatroking My two fans run at 6000 RPM xD
[039] Dommys Using technology does not directly relate to lack of faith in spiritual things.
[039] Dommys Look at The Ghosthunters
[039] Dommys lol
[039] Quatroking dommys look at 4chan
[039] Dommys What about it
[039] PuyoDead Centuries ago, thoughts like that would have got you killed. Decades ago, you simply didn't express if you thought that way, at risk of being cast away by your friendsfamily (still a bit like that today). Now it's not as much of a danger to be public about it.
[040] Quatroking I doubt there are any religious peeps on 4chan
[040] ZaxKellensSS Yes there are
[040] Dommys Based on what
[040] Quatroking At least, in my 4 years i have not encountered a single one
[040] PuyoDead 4chan is not to be studiedtaken seriously on any grounds.
[040]  Marach-18 is now known as Marafk-18
[040] Firetempest people can be religious and trolls at the same time
[041] Dommys I have read religious discussions from all points of view on 4chan
[041] Dommys Even on b
[041] PuyoDead You might as well study characters in a movie as an accurate picture of real life.
[041] Quatroking hell what do I care, religion is outdated
[041] ZaxKellensSS I'm a stout Pastafarian
[041] Quatroking people should just live their life as they want it, without being opressed by some upper being
[042] Firetempest i view b as larping as a prick
[042]  Adurah (Adura@bas4-toronto21-2925011204.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Quit Quit)
[042] ZaxKellensSS I view b as becoming more tame
[042] PuyoDead Quatro, not everyone has that luxury.
[042] Dommys I'm a christian, and I don't feel opressed. D
[042] Quatroking third world countries
[042] PuyoDead Or people raised within it.
[042] ZaxKellensSS Most brothers a while ago would flip out at anyone mentioning 4chan or b anywhere but on 4chan or b

[043] Dommys Secret club never works

[048] Quatroking remember the guy who pretended he was living underground and the topic ended with about 300 replies
[048] Quatroking shit was cash.
[048] ZaxKellensSS The main thing I remember were the creepypastas
[048] ZaxKellensSS Like the angel statue with the babysitter, and the featureless face in the window
[048] AzureAngelic heh
[049] AzureAngelic imo creepypasta is proof that good stuff can come from the chans

[050] ZaxKellensSS About the mirror in the bedroom with the faces and when he covered them they spelled out in water that they miss watching him sleep
[050] Quatroking Gamer girls I don't give a fuck that you have lady parts. 70% of the two thirds of online gamers that are women pretend to be men, but oh no, the rest of you 30% of bitches sit there attention whoring about how everyone should save your ass and we should go easy on you because you're cute
[050] AzureAngelic yeah

[052] Quatroking haha, There are more male CEOs, more make bums, more male doctors, more male junkies, more male lawyers, more sucessful male suicides. Men are generally more often found at the very top and the very bottom of society since we risk things and get shit done. Women rather choose a meh life and bitch how they get oppressed.
[052] ZaxKellensSS =O!
[052] Yourself as much as i hate to say it, that does have some small truth in it
[053] ZaxKellensSS Yup
[053] Yourself men are statistically more likely to be found in more risky jobs
[053] ZaxKellensSS I think the worst thing of b ever was bawksy
[053] Quatroking Yourself, Yeah..

[056] MeganC lol you guys push a baby out and then you'll be allowed to complain about we you'd like D

[109] AzureAngelic the game is pretty much be careful, try not to do anything dumb, kill stuff
[110] Animator But you're agreeing with the goddamned thread, Quatro. That's two-faced accusation.
[110] shapeshiftr thechris any reason
[110] AzureAngelic the goal is to get to the lowest floor, kill the boss, and get back to the top with his evil heart
[110] Quatroking ...
[110] AzureAngelic thats really all the plot there is
[110] Quatroking fuck.
[110] ZaxKellensSS Sounds fun

[254] vurtual Also, when I think of grey and gray, I think of grey as a lighter color
[254] Miclee Grey became the established British spelling in the 20th century, pace Dr. Johnson and others[128], and it is but a minor variant in American English, according to dictionaries. Canadians tend to prefer grey. The non-cognate greyhound was never grayhound. Both Grey and Gray are found in proper names everywhere in the English-speaking world. Americans tend to use gray in reference to the color and grey as the adj
[254] ZaxKellensSS Gray isn't a word to me, it looks weird o.o
[254] Animator I'm doubting you, mehicanomanManomow. Because right now, you're purposely typoing when you weren't previously.
[254] Yourself Americans tend to use gray in reference to the color and grey as the adj
[254] Yourself what

[350] Azathoth only make the exit vector negative, i think

[452] ZaxKellensSS Btw, is it just me or does gravel only show up on inland of indev
[453] EmpiresBane it's returned to exactly how it was when he got it
[453] EmpiresBane everything is erased

[600] Yourself classy
[601] EmpiresBane yeah... i said that wrong
[601] EmpiresBane basically, the the wording is wrong
[601] Yourself i don't think you could say that in a way that was right

[607] Visiiri 1.1 == 1
[608] vede 1.000...1=1

[608] Yourself basically what you can show here is that any finite length decimal can be represented as an infinite repeating decimal
[608] Visiiri If it was 1, that ......1 wouldn't be there

[611] Yourself every number has one value
[611] Yourself itself
[611] Yourself it does not, however, have a unique decimal expansion
[611] vede Okay, but seriously.
[611] Yourself not in general
[612] vede This argument is seriously the worst goddamn argument ever had.
[613] EmpiresBane yeah, forget this. Theres too much failure on both sides for anything to happen.
[613] Yourself don't blame me because you can't understand that decimals are representations of numbers and not numbers themselves
[614] PuyoDead sigh
[615] Evicous Out of curiosity, what is an actual number then
[615] Yourself a hell of a lot more abstract than that
[615] Yourself the thing is, there's nothing special about base 10 representations of numbers
[616] Yourself it's hard to separate a number from its representation

[732] vurtual I am going to put wings on it
[732] LuciferZ Okay, almost ready

[733] Visiiri D
[733] LuciferZ Vis likes it
[733] vurtual that actually
[733] vurtual worked 100% perfectly fine
[733] Visiiri I do like it
[733] vurtual except that I didn't have enough thrust to have actual lift.
[733] Visiiri I want to watch after this round
[733] vurtual glided, though, really efficiently
[734] LuciferZ Okay, started
[734] EmpiresBane vurtual, does gmod simulat lift like that
[734] LuciferZ Get the fuck in Empires and see the paladin
[734] EmpiresBane IM TRYING!
[734] vurtual I have a fin tool
[734] darkedone02 what gmod server yall playing
[734] vurtual which does
[734] EmpiresBane I CAN'T CLICK THE LINK!
[734] vurtual even things like thermal cline
[734] vurtual I'm on mine, darkedone02
[734] vurtual you cannot come as it would not be worth the effort
[734] darkedone02 what your ip address
[734] EmpiresBane god... i think i missed that link 5 times
[735] vurtual you cannot come on
[735] darkedone02 yeah right.... I like building shit on gmod, no anger involved anyways.
[735] vurtual it is passworded
[735] EmpiresBane i know the pass!!
[735] vurtual EmpiresBane, tell him and I change it
[735] vurtual I actually think source has some kind of airfoil physics, just no actual airfoils, so things just glide a little
[735] darkedone02 seriously I want to build a boat on your server
[735] vurtual there's no water
[735] LuciferZ Vede says you jerkasses need to get in here
[735] darkedone02 then an airship
[736] Visiiri I'm there
[736] TrueWolves Sorry for not being able to watch
[736] vurtual infact it's actually closed now
[736] TrueWolves But I'm doing research so I can graduate high school.
[736] darkedone02 seriously, I won't get mad...
[736] darkedone02 AndrewPH let me in his server, why not you
[736] TrueWolves Also, the reason I'm not op'd right now is to hide my ops so even if I'm on, a troll will think I'm not an op.
[737] AndrewPH darkedone02, my server's up
[737] vurtual partially because I have to spend hours
[737] darkedone02 are you playing on it
[737] vurtual making sure everyone has all the addons
[737] darkedone02 andrew
[738] darkedone02 Phx, Wiremod...
[738] darkedone02 the right map
[738] vurtual this out of date SWEP pack
[738] vurtual things like glowsticks, random addons I found useful
[738] darkedone02 nuke add-on
[738] vurtual the other wiremod SVNs, rando things
[738] vurtual no
[738] vurtual nuke is bad
[738] darkedone02 i know, I was joking P
[738] AndrewPH darkedone02, I was on it
[738] AndrewPH I should still be
[739] darkedone02 I play gmod way before I got hooked to TF2... and I've been playing gmod since gmod 8 came out.
[739] darkedone02 so I'm like... a unknown vataren gmod'er

[744] darkedone02 i built it like any other wooden boat i made, add a few water barrels because there is no boyancey tool, and to move it, I built a small wooden tent-like building, and you push your body to make it steer, and you need a crowbar to hit this metal thing to propell the boat to move forward.

[858] Malikat i have a severe dislike of my dad's wife. and her food is making me fart uncontrollably.

[858] Malikat 
[858] Malikat son pittsburgh is far away
[858] Dommys You might already have that, though
[858] Malikat yeah really.
[858] Dommys Hell, it beats being homeless.
[859] Malikat truth.
[900] Malikat step-mom's already implied she wants to throw me out though.

[907] Malikat switched to working for dell, then when i lost that, i went on to wallow in nothing
[907] Dommys Malikat has created a fine room of the best craftdwarfship, on it is engraved an image of a step mother surrounded by malikat. she is in the fetal position.
[907] Malikat The stepmother looks menacing. The malikat is in the fetal position.
[908] Firetempest shit job is better then no job. and living at home with a menacing stepmother
[908] Malikat yeah, i'm working on it. i've only been here a week
[908] Malikat i wasn't doing anything because i'm depressed, not because i thought it was a particularly intelligent life choice
[910] Firetempest they have medication for that but I guess evil stepmothers are good enough to inspire some motivation
[911] Malikat medication implies something is wrong with my brain. The only thing wrong with me is my inability to accept that my girlfriend has left and move on. Will medication allow me to do that I don't believe so.
[912] Malikat actually there's a lot of other things wrong with me, but that was the trigger, i suppose. D

[939] vurtual then fire the other into space
[939] vurtual randomly
[939] Malikat you would end up uh
[939] vurtual sure you'd need to do it in space, since you might accidentaly hit a star
[939] Malikat probably destroying the planet
[939] vurtual but WHO KNOWS WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND
[939] Malikat a star
[940] vurtual Maybe the universe has a LITERAL WALL

[940]  Cab-dono (Gtfo@201.144.130.21) Quit (Quit yes im gone D)
[940] vurtual and you send someone into the chamber with a mobile space suit

[940] Malikat the proportion of star matter to non-star-matter is really really high
[940] vurtual IMAGINE WHAT YOU MIGHT LEARN
[940] Malikat you will learn what happens when you have a portal on the surface of a star
[940] vurtual stars have no surfaces
[940] vurtual they're plasma you know
[940] vurtual They've covered WARS, you know.
[941] Malikat hmm
[941] Azathoth vurtual what
[941] Azathoth i seriously can't follow you sometimes
[941] Malikat i suppose it would just pass right through the stars, then
[941] Azathoth are you clinically insane or anything
[941] vurtual no
[941] vurtual You just refuse to read up.
[941] Malikat azzy he means what if the portal projectile travelled in a straight line at infinite velocity
[941] vurtual or just happened instantly or something
[941] Malikat and you fired one at a surface in a secure room
[942] Malikat and the other one out into space
[942] Malikat assuming it didn't hit a star (if it could hit a star) imagine what you could find
[942] Malikat i can imagine more bad end than good end
[942]  MeganC (MeganC@166.188.95.72) has joined #minecraft
[942] Azathoth lol
[942] Malikat neutron  quark stars would count as a solid
[943] Azathoth it would just kill everyone
[943] Malikat yep
[943] vurtual or aim it using a telescope
[943] Azathoth by going through some epic explosions or something
[943] Malikat good luck with that
[943] Azathoth oops we accidentally a supernova
[943] Azathoth what if you fired it into a black hole
[943] Malikat the light you see from a telescope is the position of the object dozens or thousands of years ago
[943] Malikat Azathoth assuming the projectile isn't affected by gravity, that would be literally impossible
[944] Malikat since the surface of a black hole is infinitely small
[944] vurtual Send robots to assemble a telescope on a planet somewhat away, and you could theoretically map huge portions of the universe, just by some kind of manual von neumann portal device.
[944] Azathoth the singularity is infinitely small
[944] Azathoth but not the event horizon
[944] Malikat yeah, but the event horizon isn't a surface, it's a gravity line
[944] Azathoth it bends space around it
[944] LuciferZ It's not a line
[945] LuciferZ It's a plane
[945] Malikat well yeah.
[945] Azathoth the portal would be affected
[945] LuciferZ Plane = concept of a surface
[945] Malikat not if it was infinite velocity
[945] Azathoth it couldn't be
[945] Malikat well, assuming it's stupidly high velocity but not infinite
[946] Azathoth wwait
[946] Wervyn What exactly do you mean, infinite velocity
[946] Azathoth it couldn't even exist
[946] vurtual The moment you fire, WILD PORTAL APPEARS!
[946] Malikat yeah
[946] vurtual Portal used TELEPORT! You're on A PLANET MILLIONS OF LIGHTYEARS AWAY
[946] Wervyn So, already physically impossible.
[946] Malikat quite so.
[946] Malikat the question is, do portals transmit gravity
[946] vurtual nope
[947] vurtual they influence no pull
[947] Azathoth you could use them to create energy
[947] vurtual if an object is partway through, it deals with both forces, or just whichever it is more in.
[947] Malikat yeah
[947] Azathoth superposition
[947] Malikat i think that if you hit a black hole with a portal
[947] Malikat you would have the most ridiculous execution device
[947] Azathoth the portal basically connects two points in space, the way i see it
[947] Malikat OR
[947] Malikat OR.
[947] Azathoth so they're basically adjacent even if they aren't
[948] Wervyn Right. Two portals on the ceiling and floor is a basic perpetual motion device. It generates potentially infinite energy through the use of gravity.
[948] Azathoth yeah
[948] Malikat the immense forces of the black holes particles attempting to not be all in the same point in space
[948] vurtual portals already have a very defined laws of physics

[949] Malikat and then put a coil around it
[949] Wervyn Yep.
[949] Malikat however, half life 2 already has the ZPM gun

[951] Azathoth what
[951] vurtual ...
[951] vurtual a game
[951] vurtual not a TV show
[952] Wervyn Am I really that old Are you really that young
[952] vurtual We're talking about Portal.
[952] Azathoth you're really that old
[952] vurtual the 2007 game by valve software.
[952] Wervyn Travesty. Can't make a MST3K reference anymore.
[952] vurtual not the 2002-2004 show
[952] vurtual GAMES ARE NOT SHOWS
[952] vurtual THEY ARE SERIOUS BUSINESS
[953] Azathoth i haven't watched MST3K in years
[953] vurtual AS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PREFORM LITERAL SCIENCE TO DETERMINE THE LIMITS OF CONCEPTS
[953] Malikat lol.
[953] Malikat i never watched mst3k. 
[953] vurtual bonus points when it's a science environment
[953] Malikat i was led to believe that was tragedy.
[953] Wervyn It is.
[953] Azathoth hah
[953] vurtual Now I wanna go make that quantum entanglement gun, just so I can theorize about IT, too.
[954] Malikat pfft
[954] Malikat ender's game already theorizes about quantum entanglement enough for me
[954] vurtual But the idea is cool!
[954] Azathoth ender's naked little boys
[954] vurtual You have this gun, and it fires blue and orange, but instead of portals, it links the two hit objects to have shared forces!
[955] vurtual I can think of so many cool things to use that for.
[955] vurtual Like, hit a really heavy object, pick up a box, tell people how strong you are, set the box down, link the box.
[956] Malikat rofl
[957] Wervyn Yeah, I know the first thing I would do with a ground breaking invention that redefines the laws of physics as we know it is Carnival tricks.
[957] Malikat ^
[957] vurtual Experimenting, obviously.
[957] vurtual I mean, how can you use it for things, if you have no idea what crazy things you can use it for
[958] vurtual Hey, you could play catch with yourself.
[958] Kodaichi that can be done against a wall
[958] vurtual Link two balls on the opposite sides of a room, pick one up, throw it, catch the other!
[958]  Malikat waves at Yourself
[958] Malikat that's actually an interesting idea, vurtual
[958] vurtual so it looks like you're throwing a ball between you and an invisible guy.
[958] Malikat juggling with two invisible people
[958] TrueWolves ...
[959] vurtual though that'd require the ability to rotate the way the forces act
[959] TrueWolves Please someone tell me I'm not the only one that holds his breath in real life when exploring under water...
[959] Malikat go to a sex shop and link your dick to one of the models on the shelf
[959] vurtual I do, TrueWolves
[959] vurtual OCD-ly
[959] Malikat i do that sometimes a little bit
[959] vurtual okay i have no breath bar must challenge myself
[959] vurtual HOLD BREATH MUST MAKE TO AIR AAAAA
[959] Kodaichi lol why would you hold your breath underwater
[959] Kodaichi breathing water is eas.
[1000] vurtual Link two guns sitting on a table
[1000] Kodaichi try it, it's just like breathing air
[1000] vurtual pick one up, load it, grab the other and load it, go back to the first.
[1000] vurtual one-handed dual wielding.
[1000] Kodaichi okay. I got one
[1000]  TrueWolves can hold his breath for about 2 minutes, =D
[1000] Kodaichi fire the orange beam at your car
[1001] Kodaichi and the blue one at another car
[1001] Kodaichi then you can drive 2 cars at once

[1001] Firetempest Wervyn, you know of rifftrax
[1001] vurtual The only problems are the doubled force required to get the same amount of movement.
[1001] Wervyn By name, but not really.
[1001] vurtual so turning the car would be really, really hard.
[1002] vurtual unless you had an exo-suit or something.
[1002] Malikat no
[1002] Kodaichi true guess
[1002] Malikat it doesn't take double force
[1002] Kodaichi well, only twice as hard
[1002] vurtual since you also have to turn the other object
[1002] Firetempest should look it up, its the mst3k crews current job
[1002] Malikat it doesn't split the force between the two objects, it copies it
[1002] Wervyn Hm.
[1002] vurtual friction and so on
[1002] Kodaichi steering a car takes very little force. I think I can man i out and steer 2
[1002] vurtual the alternative is not having things like levitation
[1003] Malikat that just means if the other car is much much heavier, it won't mirror your car
[1003] Kodaichi i typed in another room that I went to sleep, lol
[1003] Kodaichi guess i'd better actually do that
[1003] Malikat lol noooo
[1003] vurtual no
[1003] Kodaichi 
[1003] Malikat anyway, i don't like the idea of a quantum entanglement gun, because how do you determine the boundary of an object

[1004] Kodaichi ah true.
[1004] vurtual oh hey, link two grenades, one being a fake, one having a fast fuse.
[1004] vurtual can the gravgun act on it
[1004] Malikat vurtual ur dum
[1004] Kodaichi link an elephant and a hot air baloon
[1004] Kodaichi have fun trying to picture that one

[1005] vurtual hot air balloon has a ridiculously hard time moving
[1005] vurtual If it CAN fly, elephant floats.
[1005] Kodaichi lul
[1005] Wervyn What happens if someone punctures the balloon
[1005] Malikat what
[1005] Malikat cat is crazy cat lady
[1005] vurtual elephant gets stabbed
[1005] Kodaichi the elephant dies
[1006] Kodaichi (
[1006] Wervyn How Describe the forces in action here.
[1006] Malikat hmm
[1006] vurtual the puncturing object jabbing in
[1006] Malikat no
[1006] Kodaichi you know all the air that comes shooting out of the baloon
[1006]  MeganC (MeganC@166.188.95.72) Quit (Ping timeout 180 seconds)
[1006] vurtual it'd be like being jabbed. Sure, it may not be logical, but it's more fun
[1006] Kodaichi well with the elephant, that's blood
[1006] Malikat the forces would be the seperating pressure on the canvas of the balloon
[1006] vurtual someone bleeding and someone else not bleeding should not result in bleeding
[1006] Wervyn Will the elephant deflate and collapse in on itself
[1006] vurtual just, things like an object movingfalling
[1007] Malikat Wervyn that's kind of what i'm trying to think
[1007] vurtual switch link to an object being carried by a plane, and then drop the object, cause elephant to fall
[1007] vurtual or just link a cargo helicopter and elephant.
[1007] Wervyn How do the molecules of two completely dissimilar objects interlink
[1007] vurtual or rotors.
[1007] vurtual energy field thingy!
[1007] Malikat that's why it's dumb, you can't assume the gun is sentient with respect to identifying objects and such
[1007] Wervyn But you know, don't let the actual mechanics get in the way of your masturbatory speculation.
[1007] Kodaichi yeah
[1007] Malikat ^
[1008] vurtual Okay, it's a portal gun, that fires gravity gunning.
[1008] Kodaichi this is a crazy idea and really fn to think about
[1008] Kodaichi I'll make sure to think about you in my sleep )
[1008] Malikat A+
[1008] Kodaichi I mean, your idea...
[1008] vurtual so two linked objects will have things like gravity, things acting on it, moving, and so on, all applied to echother.
[1009] Kodaichi night all
[1009]  Kodaichi (silentj43@bas6-hamilton14-1176141300.dsl.bell.ca) has left #minecraft
[1010] vurtual still imagining an elephant linked to helicopter rotors.
[1010] Malikat that only works if you generalize every force before transmission
[1011] Malikat therefore the puncture of the balloon would be generalized as a pressure on the external surface of the elephant
[1011] vurtual trying to think about making it in lua for garry's mod
[1011] Malikat and the deflation would be the removal of the general lightening of the elephant
[1012] vurtual do all the force stuff properly and so on
[1012] Malikat the object of the balloon would be the canvas surrounding the air, not the air
[1012] Malikat therefore if they were linked before the balloon inflated, the elephant would feel like it was bloated tremendously when the balloon inflated
[1013] vurtual make it so that if you shootdamage something, it shoots the other object identically.
[1013] Malikat or if they were linked when the balloon was already inflated, the elephant would feel.. uh..
[1013] Malikat hhmm.
[1013] vurtual normal
[1013]  Tamschi (Tamme@p5DC10922.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #minecraft
[1013] Malikat once the balloon was deflated
[1013] vurtual anti-bloated
[1013] vurtual crushed.
[1014] Malikat crushed from the inside.
[1014] vurtual granted, the Elephant's own force would hold the balloon together
[1014] vurtual so the balloon would just lose hot air
[1014] Malikat it might.
[1014] vurtual you could make an unbreakable parachute that way
[1014]  Moocmanoffline is now known as Moocman
[1014] vurtual which, even if shot tremendously, would not de-parachute-shape
[1014] Malikat i think if you have a bidirectional transfer of forces, everything just freezes unless they're identical objects
[1015] vurtual Seriously though, this in garry's mod, plus a portalgun SWEP that doesn't suck...
[1015] vurtual oh man all the things you could do
[1015] Malikat i would think you only have one direction of force transfer
[1015] vurtual that's no fun!
[1015] Malikat no, it is fun
[1015] Malikat otherwise you can't do anything
[1015] vurtual We'd figure it out in lua

[1016] vurtual both feel like they're 11 tons
[1017] Malikat not quite
[1017] Malikat you would actually ruin the idea that gravity causes constant acceleration
[1017] Malikat because the force of gravity increases as mass increases
[1017] vurtual Oh hey, here's an idea.
[1018] Malikat but the acceleration of a constant force decreases as mass increases
[1018] vurtual Create a very light weight on the end of a rope, around your size
[1018] vurtual link you and the weight
[1018] vurtual so you can pulley yourself up places
[1018] Malikat you'd have an increase of force without an increase of mass
[1018] vurtual without actually having to be attached to a pulley
[1018] vurtual then float around!
[1019] vurtual the problem being that you'd feel like you're on a rope
[1019] Malikat okay i'm done speculating, you're just being mastubatory
[1019] vurtual yes I am

[1121] darkedone02 if they add that, I be more addicted to that game, like i am addicted to Civ 4
[1121] darkedone02 in a way
[1122] TrueWolves Well, it's not so much of they as he
[1122] TrueWolves only 1 person programs the game.
[1122] TrueWolves And he's more focused on getting in core features in so the game won't be in development for the next 30 years.
[1122] darkedone02 seriously, dwarfs are true inventors of arms, weapons, masonry, and gunpowder... they research many things then man can ever hold of in many dwarven rpg legends
[1123] TrueWolves Besides
[1123] TrueWolves I'd personaly wouldn't want DF to end up like every other Civ rip-off
[1123] darkedone02 hell, even in elder scrolls and warhammer 40K, they are extinct, or close to extinction
[1123] darkedone02 i don't want it to be totally like civ 4, but there is just one element and that just a research tree
[1124] Firetempest dorfs make wonderful things httpoglaf.commediacomicwonders.jpg
[1124] darkedone02 damnit, it's going to be a hybrid rts... it's already an rts mixed with city building and resources, and other shit...
[1124] TrueWolves At least let the game have it's other features first, it's still in development.
[1124] darkedone02 I know it's under development, but like I said, research is on my wish list.

[1320] gdude2002school Well,
[1321] gdude2002school I think they should support israel
[1321] MalikatFFXIII because there are plenty of countries with islam as a national religion
[1321] gdude2002school Just not the terrorists
[1321] gdude2002school P
[1321] MalikatFFXIII the jews only have israel and hollywood
[1322] gdude2002school Hollywood xD
[1322] Speljohan_ more like the jews own usa
[1323] gdude2002school Reminds me of the song Amish paradise
[1323] gdude2002school youtube it
[1323] Speljohan_ anyways, i am definately a supporter of palestine
[1323] gdude2002school Palestine
[1323] gdude2002school Why so
[1323] Speljohan_ islam.
[1323] gdude2002school Mm.
[1323] gdude2002school I don't have a problem with islams in general
[1324] Speljohan_ because in this case the land was taken from them
[1324] Speljohan_ and given to the jews by a third party
[1324] gdude2002school I don't like the fucking literal ones that kill everyone with bombs.
[1324] gdude2002school P
[1324] Speljohan_ usa
[1324] Speljohan_ they had nothing to do with it
[1324] Speljohan_ and thanks to them, the was will probably never end
[1324] gdude2002school USA is primarily Jewish though.
[1324] Speljohan_ war
[1324] gdude2002school Thanksgiving is apublic holiday
[1324] Speljohan_ yes, problem is that is no excuse
[1324] gdude2002school and that's Jewish
[1324] gdude2002school so
[1325] MalikatFFXIII speljohan_ how did the muslims get palestine
[1325] Speljohan_ gdude2002school I don't like the fucking literal ones that kill everyone with bombs.
[1325] gdude2002school xD
[1325] Speljohan_ that's generally what media wants to feed you
[1325] gdude2002school Well,y eah
[1325] Speljohan_ because MUSLIMS ARE EVIIIIL!
[1325] gdude2002school but they DO do that
[1325] gdude2002school And I didn't say musilms are evil .
[1325] gdude2002school I said the literal ones are
[1325] MalikatFFXIII i don't know what media you watch, el jo
[1325] gdude2002school P
[1326] MalikatFFXIII maybe for like a few months after 911 the media demonized muslims
[1326] bildramer derp
[1326] gdude2002school Well, there's still racism, MalikatFFXIII
[1326] MalikatFFXIII but that's gotten to be a pretty touchy subject now
[1326] gdude2002school Mm.
[1326] bildramer why are we discussing boring stuff
[1326] gdude2002school I've seen muslims bullied over here
[1326] bildramer who cares about some countries bombing stuff
[1327] gdude2002school bildramer Because you're the only one finding it boring. P
[1327] MalikatFFXIII well, yeah, americans are stupid. they demonize muslims because christianity teaches that all non christianity religions are pagan and uncivlized
[1327] Siiseli D
[1327] bildramer hi
[1327] gdude2002school Christianity is bullshit.
[1327] Speljohan_ indeed
[1327] Siiseli fucking christians
[1327] bildramer ^
[1327] Speljohan_ all religion is bullshit
[1327] Speljohan_ especially western ones
[1327] bildramer 4 COMBO
[1327] Siiseli well I dunno
[1327] gdude2002school Agreed, HOWEVER
[1327] Speljohan_ at least the eastern religions don't cause trouble
[1327] gdude2002school HOWEVER
[1327] Siiseli let's say all THEISTIC religion is bullshit
[1327] gdude2002school ..
[1327] bildramer lol
[1327] Siiseli for example buddhism can be rather nice
[1327] bildramer ^
[1327] Speljohan_ Speljohan_ at least the eastern religions don't cause trouble
[1327] bildramer yay ikaruga
[1327] gdude2002school If I had to be part of SOME religion
[1327] gdude2002school It would be Wicca
[1327] Siiseli D
[1327] gdude2002school I mean,
[1327] MalikatFFXIII rofl wicca
[1327] KrimZon even buddhists used to try and pickle themselves
[1328] Siiseli if I had to be, it would be buddhism
[1328] gdude2002school one of the tenants
[1328] bildramer pastafarianism
[1328] Speljohan_ i'd totally be a jew
[1328] gdude2002school is
[1328] Speljohan_ cus then i'd be rich
[1328] gdude2002school Sex is sacred
[1328] Speljohan_ !!!
[1328] KrimZon they're still wacky
[1328] gdude2002school Meaning,
[1328] bildramer lololol
[1328] gdude2002school they allow multiple sexual partners
[1328] gdude2002school xD
[1328] bildramer D
[1328] bildramer what about old norse
[1328] gdude2002school aaand
[1328] gdude2002school in March,
[1328] MalikatFFXIII i like most of the religions that i've learned about in theory
[1328] gdude2002school there's a festival of fertility
[1328] gdude2002school Where couples jump over a bonfire
[1328] gdude2002school and then go screw in the woods
[1328] bildramer all your life is 1. drink 2. fuck virgins 3. fuck non-virgins
[1328] gdude2002school xD
[1328] Speljohan_ of course MalikatFFXIII
[1329] MalikatFFXIII but most of the people who are religious are just using their religion as a weapon of choice
[1329] gdude2002school Rofl bildramer
[1329] Speljohan_ i see religion as just another branch of historyphilosophy
[1329] Speljohan_ and it can be quite interesting
[1329] gdude2002school mm.
[1329] gdude2002school it can.
[1329] MalikatFFXIII like, i hate gays. god does too, see here because he hates gays, that's why i hate gays. not because i had a weird dream about steve last night
[1330] KrimZon mmm steve 3
[1330] Speljohan_ lol
[1330] MalikatFFXIII steve.. what kind of a rapper name is steve
[1330] gdude2002school Lol.
[1330] bildramer lol
[1330] gdude2002school I remember seeing something on youtube
[1330] KrimZon LL Cool Steve
[1331] gdude2002school it was
[1331] gdude2002school um

[1333] gdude2002school hi siiseli
[1333] Siiseli the one gay guy I knew I wouldn't have thought was gay
[1333] Siiseli then again, that one lesbian girl I know was obviously so
[1333] MalikatFFXIII a gay white dude who i wouldn't have known except sometimes
[1333] gdude2002school Well, some hide it
[1333] gdude2002school but most don't care really
[1333] gdude2002school lolol
[1333] MalikatFFXIII and a gay black dude who dressed in drag on his days off
[1333] gdude2002school Yeah, the second years here act like lesbians
[1333] Siiseli the two bisexual girls I know.. well I would've guessed.
[1334] Siiseli It really just doesn't matter
[1334] gdude2002school They keep giving each other lovebites
[1334] gdude2002school I saw one with one
[1334] gdude2002school I was like
[1334] gdude2002school Who gave you that
[1334] gdude2002school She was like
[1334] gdude2002school Aheh, Emma
[1334] gdude2002school .
[1334] gdude2002school .
[1334] MalikatFFXIII and then you were like CAN I GIVE YOU ANOTHER

[1334] MalikatFFXIII and fucked her in the supply closet
[1334] MalikatFFXIII oh

[1337] gdude2002school t
[1338] gdude2002school bildramer I have no idea tbh
[1338] bildramer the problem is probably the file enumerating shit
[1338] gdude2002school use wom hax
[1338] gdude2002school it's easier
[1338] bildramer lol
[1338] gdude2002school lol
[1338] gdude2002school bildramer how old are you
[1338] bildramer 14
[1338] bildramer y u ask lel d
[1338] gdude2002school oic
[1338] gdude2002school iunno
[1338] gdude2002school So you'd be in..
[1338] gdude2002school Second year in Ireland
[1338] bildramer So I'm trying to list all files in a folder
[1338] gdude2002school xD
[1338] bildramer is it so hard
[1339] gdude2002school right
[1339] gdude2002school depends on the language
[1339] gdude2002school P
[1339] bildramer C++ ;_;
[1339] gdude2002school python print , .join(os.listdir(directory))
[1339] bildramer I'm considering making a python exe
[1339] gdude2002school C++ sucks
[1339] gdude2002school xD
[1339] bildramer py2exe etc.
[1339] gdude2002school That can be done
[1339] gdude2002school but it's stuipid
[1339] gdude2002school tbh
[1339] bildramer it should list all files and write them to a files.txt
[1339] gdude2002school You're better off doing it mnaually.
[1339] bildramer then the C++ exe loads it
[1339] bildramer lol
[1340] gdude2002school waaay better off doing it manually.
[1340] bildramer not really
[1340] gdude2002school Yes, really
[1340] gdude2002school otherwise
[1340] gdude2002school you'll be missing dependancies
[1340] bildramer have you seen how many chunk files there are in a standard infdev save
[1340] gdude2002school Yeah.
[1340] gdude2002school Man,
[1340] gdude2002school if you were gonna try and EXE-ize a python app
[1340] gdude2002school what I would do
[1341] gdude2002school is
[1341] gdude2002school Get a clean copy of python
[1341] gdude2002school install the extras it needs for the app
[1341] gdude2002school and put it in a folder
[1341] gdude2002school In a second folder, put your python app
[1341]  vede (joshua@wsip-174-79-147-235.tu.ok.cox.net) Quit (Ping timeout 180 seconds)
[1341] gdude2002school then package them up with izarc or something with the line
[1341] vurtual no how about
[1341] vurtual you turn it into C++
[1341] vurtual or something
[1341] gdude2002school cd .appdir && ..pydirpython run.py
[1342] gdude2002school and that's all you'd need to do
[1342] gdude2002school really
[1342] vurtual using the same design, but in a different language.
[1342] gdude2002school vurtual Why use one program language to package another
[1342] vurtual Because you CAN.
[1342] gdude2002school That's stupid.
[1342] vurtual Additionally, writing a python-to-C++ program in python would be funny.
[1342] gdude2002school It's already been done.
[1342] gdude2002school import ctypes
[1343] gdude2002school If you REALLY wanted to make an EXE
[1343] gdude2002school I would use python to package stuff up
[1343] bildramer olol
[1344] bildramer u mad
[1344] gdude2002school and autoit to make you a simple exe
[1344] gdude2002school no, bildy.
[1344] bildramer autoIt #
[1344] bildramer 3
[1344] bildramer oh yeah
[1344] bildramer replace python with AutoIt
[1344] gdude2002school lol

[1813] MalikatFFXIII or smaller, if your fog distance is less
[1813] Riverthief I suppose
[1815] Riverthief Btw, I wanna test my limits. I heard that a memory editor can change the blocks in your inventories to other blocks and make them never run out, etc, etc. I've got a plan involving infdev, dynamite and a few weakly-contained infinite lava blocks. What's the correct way to do this
[1816] Cryovat Spectacularly P
[1816] Riverthief Ahaha
[1816] Riverthief But seriously, do I just use cheat engine or something I've searched the forums, no luck
[1817] MalikatFFXIII er
[1818] MalikatFFXIII don't discuss cheat engine in here
[1818] MalikatFFXIII but for infdev
[1818] MalikatFFXIII or indev
[1818] MalikatFFXIII you can use NBTedit
[1818] MalikatFFXIII it's a very simple and intuitive interface for editing save files
[1818] Quatroking why not discuss cheat engine
[1818] Quatroking its not a custom client or a server
[1818] MalikatFFXIII either load your indev save (.mclevel) in it and find the player entity
[1819] Quatroking hell its not even built for minecraft ._.
[1819] MalikatFFXIII 1. You may talk about anything except the following things - Custom Servers - Minecraft Hacks
[1819] MalikatFFXIII it is used as a minecraft hack
[1819] MalikatFFXIII or, for an infdev save, go to your world folder and load level.dat in NBTedit
[1819] Quatroking ...so is nbtedit
[1819] Quatroking you hack your savegame, big deal
[1819] Roadcrosser my point too
[1820] MalikatFFXIII that's not a hack, it's a save editor.
[1820] Quatroking bullshit
[1820] MalikatFFXIII hacking is changing the state of the game
[1820] Roadcrosser thats cheating
[1820] MalikatFFXIII yeah, it's cheating
[1820] MalikatFFXIII but it's not HACKING.
[1820] Riverthief Kk, tyvm. And I don't know if I just manufactured this memory or not...but I seem to remember a gamemode where you started with a bunch of steel stuff (weps, armor, etc), and when the arrows landed it spawned mobs. Is this real
[1820] Roadcrosser like how I use a mouse recorder to quickly visit eceryone in pet society
[1820] Quatroking hacking is changing the state of the game it's a save editor.
[1820] MalikatFFXIII that was an old version of infdev
[1820] Riverthief aah
[1820] Quatroking pretty sure editing a save changes the game state
[1821] Quatroking derp
[1821] MalikatFFXIII Quatroking cry some moor, baby
[1821] Quatroking Why should I cheat engine can be used fine for inventory hacking
[1821] MalikatFFXIII notch released the specifications for the save files so that people could create utilities to easily edit them
[1821] Quatroking save goes for NBTedit
[1821] Quatroking same
[1822] Quatroking besides cheat engine doesn't even work on multiplayer
[1822] MalikatFFXIII when notch makes a similar disclosure for active inventory and such, then it will be less like hacking
[1822]  Cryovat is displeased with his mine (
[1822] Cryovat I can't find gold (
[1822] MalikatFFXIII gold is only good for your hoes
[1823] Quatroking Hacking (English verb to hack, singular noun a hack) refers to the re-configuring or re-programming of a system to function in ways not facilitated by the owner, administrator, or designer.
[1823] MalikatFFXIII which sounds like what cheat engine does
[1823] MalikatFFXIII ie reconfiguring the memory state of a system
[1823] Quatroking Yes, its also the same as NBTedit does
[1823] MalikatFFXIII not really
[1823] Quatroking The terms hack and hacking are also used to refer to a modification of a program or device to give the user access to features that were otherwise unavailable,
[1824] Quatroking boom shakalaka
[1824] MalikatFFXIII considering the save file is not a part of the system except during saving and loading
[1824] MalikatFFXIII you're not modifying the program or the device with NBTedit
[1824] MalikatFFXIII you're only proving me more and more correct
[1824] Quatroking jesus christ malikat editing savegames is the same as hacking savegames
[1825] MalikatFFXIII hacking involves changing a running program or changing the way a program will run
[1825] MalikatFFXIII not changing the data the program stored
[1825] MalikatFFXIII you don't hack a save file, you edit it
[1825]  Quatroking facepalms
[1825] Quatroking Cheat engine can be discussed fine, Riverthief.
[1825] Quatroking We've done it before.
[1826] MalikatFFXIII how about you ask an op, then
[1826] Roadcrosser don't make me call the ops
[1826] Quatroking Very well
[1826] Quatroking It doesn't work in multiplayer so I don't see why it should not be discussed anyways

[1826] TrueWolves` hmm
[1826] Quatroking Can cheat engine be discussed when the purpose is inventory editing
[1827] MalikatFFXIII cheat engine used for minecraft hacking
[1827] TrueWolves` It... depends really.
[1827] MalikatFFXIII 1. You may talk about anything except the following things - Custom Servers - Minecraft Hacks
[1827] Quatroking single player
[1827] TrueWolves` It's been allowd by the other ops before.
[1827] Quatroking cheat engine doesn't work on multiplayer by the way, due to the server being awesome
[1827]  smn`off is now known as smn
[1828] MalikatFFXIII the discussion you walked in on was quatroking trying to say that cheat engine should be just as valid for discussion as NBTedit because NBTedit is used to hack save files
[1828] MalikatFFXIII even though NBTedit is based on notch's free disclosure of the format for the save files, and all it does it make clear edits
[1829] Quatroking the only difference between cheat engine and nbtedit is that one edits the game realtime, and the latter edits the game offline
[1829] MalikatFFXIII and that is the difference between hacking and cheating!
[1829] MalikatFFXIII that is like saying swords and axes are the same thing because the only difference is that axes have a longer handle
[1830] TrueWolves` hmm...
[1830] MalikatFFXIII yes it is the difference and that is the point
[1830] Riverthief aah! but they DO the same thing

[1830] TrueWolves` Hia Fox.
[1830] Quatroking I'm not going to a shitty channel just because this guy here doesn't know what hacking savegames is
[1830] Riverthief Cheating tool, actually
[1830] Riverthief Lol
[1830] Riverthief CHEAT engine
[1831] MalikatFFXIII therefore why it's not supposed to be discussed on #minecraft
[1831] MalikatFFXIII it's a cheating tool that works by hacking the game

[1831] Riverthief No
[1831] Quatroking Truewolves, is cheat engine allowed or not.
[1831] MalikatFFXIII like NBTedit is commonly a cheating tool that works by editing a save file.
[1831] Riverthief It works by changine memory addresses in real time
[1831]  Jazzzzzz (wut@cpe-98-15-247-186.hvc.res.rr.com) has left #minecraft
[1831] Quatroking It has been accepted before and there is no reason why it should not be allowed now.
[1831] Riverthief The only difference between the two is
[1831] Riverthief One does it in real time
[1831] Riverthief one does it offline
[1831] MalikatFFXIII actually, that's a huge difference
[1832] MalikatFFXIII cheat engine is changing values in the memory - ie in the RAM, in realtime
[1832] Quatroking you do realize that cheat engine has less features of NBTedit
[1832] MalikatFFXIII NBTedit changes values in a saved file - ie on your hard drive - when you tell it to save
[1832] Quatroking good luck changing your in-game location without the client tripping balls
[1832] MalikatFFXIII cheat engine is just harder to use than NBTedit
[1832]  ookami is now known as SolidSmithers
[1832] Riverthief Did you know that in vanilla WoW it was possible to comeplete quests qhile not in the game by means of editing character files
[1833] MalikatFFXIII because of the simple fact that NBTedit is based on notch's disclosure
[1833] Riverthief while
[1833] Quatroking it does the same damn thing if not less ._.
[1833] MalikatFFXIII yeah, that's called editing a save file
[1833] Riverthief Yea
[1833] Riverthief Well, basically
[1833] MalikatFFXIII you can do it in diablo II, also
[1833]  SolidSmithers is now known as ookami
[1833] Riverthief Yep
[1834] MalikatFFXIII or you can do it actively by hacking diablo II using a trainer, or something like cheat engine
[1834] Riverthief yep
[1834] Riverthief so
[1834] Riverthief tell me the difference
[1834] Riverthief between doing it in game
[1834] Riverthief an d doing it while not in game
[1834] Riverthief it does the same thing
[1834] MalikatFFXIII cheat engine is digging into the guts of a running program, grabbing it by the neurons and forcing it to do what you want
[1834] Riverthief yep
[1834] Quatroking so the only thing that can be dangerous is having your client crash and not save
[1834] MalikatFFXIII NBTedit is whispering in its ear while it is asleep so that it wakes up remembering something different
[1835] Riverthief but
[1835] Riverthief what happens after you're finished in those two scenarios
[1835] MalikatFFXIII actually if you're retarded enough with cheat engine, you could bluescreen windows
[1835] Riverthief invalid, unrelated point
[1835] MalikatFFXIII no, it is a very related point fool
[1835] Riverthief why
[1835] Quatroking So people should ask for help to prevent it from happening
[1835] Quatroking derp
[1835] MalikatFFXIII hacking is much more fragile of an operation

[1836] Riverthief 
[1836] Riverthief Kyle, do you think there's any difference between cheating offline in games and cheating in real time
[1837] MalikatFFXIII that's not the question
[1837] Quatroking you're trying to tell us that we shouldn't discuss a program because you can use it to crash windows
[1837] Quatroking big deal
[1837] Kyle I think cheating ruins the fun sometimes.
[1837] Riverthief If you wanted to though
[1837] Kyle But cheating online ruins the fun for everyone else
[1837] MalikatFFXIII i'm telling you not to discuss a program because it is hacking, and 1. You may talk about anything except the following things - Custom Servers - Minecraft Hacks
[1837] Quatroking Malikat, define minecraft hacks
[1837] MalikatFFXIII and you are being a fool and trying to say that because NBTedit - which is not a hacking tool - is permissible, your tool should be too
[1838] MalikatFFXIII minecraft hacks a tool used to alter the running of minecraft from the way notch intended it to run
[1838] MalikatFFXIII any tool
[1838] Riverthief Kyle, say you wanted to get 30 stone blocks while in indev. Is there any difference between doing that while in game and while not in game
[1838] Quatroking Did notch ever intend to alter the inventory, malikat
[1838] Kyle Well, it's easy enough ingame...
[1839] Quatroking or the player's location
[1839] MalikatFFXIII no, but i'm sure he intended for save files to be loaded
[1839] Kyle but i see what you mean.
[1839] Quatroking So because you think he intended save files to be editing, NBTedit is allright
[1839] Kyle I have used NTB forge before, but it was to test out a trap idea I have.
[1839] MalikatFFXIII no
[1839] Riverthief MalikatFFXIII says that doing it in game is bad, while doing it while not in game is good
[1839]  TrueWolves` is locked out of his op powers when not at home unless he wants to ghost his home client and cause problems for his home computer...
[1839] MalikatFFXIII because i KNOW that editing a save file doesn't make minecraft do something notch didn't intend for it to do
[1839] Quatroking Maybe he just uses NBT so he can easily debug the client
[1840] MalikatFFXIII actually, Riverthief, i have used cheat engine a lot
[1840] MalikatFFXIII i just don't DISCUSS IT HERE.
[1840] MalikatFFXIII because 1. You may talk about anything except the following things - Custom Servers - Minecraft Hacks
[1840] Quatroking so Notch intended to have users edit their inventory and player location
[1840] TrueWolves` ...
[1840] MalikatFFXIII i didn't say anything that does something notch didn't intend
[1840] TrueWolves` Can you two please take it to #MCChatter or #ArgueHere  -.-;
[1840]  ZephyrFox sighs
[1841] ZephyrFox seriously this is making my brain ache
[1841] MalikatFFXIII i said anything that makes the minecraft application run in a way notch did not intend
[1841] Riverthief I'm done arguing here anyway, let's just agree to disagree.
[1841] Quatroking Fine, trueWolves, I'll quit the discussion because this nobrainer can obviously not throw in a good reason why cheatengine should not be discussed.
[1841] Quatroking Again, trueWolves, I ask you, should it be allowed or not.
[1841] MalikatFFXIII YES. I CAN.
[1841] MalikatFFXIII 1. You may talk about anything except the following things - Custom Servers - Minecraft Hacks !
[1841] Quatroking Your say.
[1841] Kyle ...
[1842] Kyle I think that Notch wants to stop the wave of hacks, and by not discussing it here, it slows it
[1842] Quatroking Truewolves
[1842] MalikatFFXIII hey Quatroking
[1842] Kyle To avoid greifing and such.
[1842] Riverthief truewolves say I came in here, you had ops, and I started a conversation concerning cheat engine. Would I get -v'dkickedbannedw.e
[1842] MalikatFFXIII also this 2. Do not skim over the rules, test them to see how far they go, or taunt the ops. You are not slick and you will be kicked or banned.
[1842] TrueWolves` I give warnings before kicks
[1842] Quatroking I'm not testing anything, I'm asking if its allowed or not.
[1842] Riverthief well, would I get warned
[1843] TrueWolves` Yes, but right now at school my ability to op is severly limited
[1843]  SMP (SMP@68-114-62-5.dhcp.davl.vt.charter.com) Quit (Quit Probably due to internet issues.)
[1843] MalikatFFXIII I have always seen ops tell people not to discuss custom clientsservers, or hacks in here
[1843] Quatroking Truewolves, I don't care, I just want to know if its allowed or not 
[1843] MalikatFFXIII jesus christ, can you read
[1843] TrueWolves` Given the topic is contraversal, and you are making a client run in an unintended way, I'm asking as nicely as posable to move it elsewhere
[1843] Quatroking Fine
[1843] TrueWolves` I'm not sure Quatro, but I'm leaning on no.
[1844] Quatroking I'm going to play some indev.
[1844] Quatroking maybe build a nice castle.
[1844] Riverthief Me too
[1844] MalikatFFXIII gaaah now mibbit is giving me ads like Learn Real Hacking Skills. thanks a lot. D 
[1844] Riverthief Gonna work on my mine again

[1848] bildramer whatever

[1848] TrueWolves` It's a survey on the community of minecraft and your opionions on it, that's all
[1848] bildramer meh
[1848] bildramer won't take it
[1848] MalikatFFXIII Riverthief i am filled with rage for fedora after i spent two hours trying to figure out why it wouldn't let me pipe my wireless connection to the internet over to my wired connection to the desktop
[1849] MalikatFFXIII it SHOULD have been letting me but nooo
[1849] Riverthief Wait
[1849] Riverthief How was this set up

[1852] MalikatFFXIII i know! i looked it up online to see how to do it
[1852] bildramer lol
[1852] MalikatFFXIII and when i thought i had it configured just right, it started misbehaving
[1852] Riverthief I'll emulate the problem tomorrow at my place and see if I can do it myself
[1852] MalikatFFXIII first it would fucking CRASH the damn network manager process when i tried to select the wired network

[1858] TrueWolves` It's a survey on the community of MineCraft Jat.
[1858] Jat oh well i dont know much about the community
[1859] Jat i really dont pay much attention to minecraft anymore
[1859] Jat im mainly waiting for mp survival
[1859] TrueWolves` Fair enough, a no then
[1859] Jat unless you still think i should

[1901] MalikatFFXIII oh man i really love FF13 for the levelling system
[1901] MalikatFFXIII i mean, it's horrible and linear
[1901] MalikatFFXIII like the sphere grid in 10 but without the options
[1901] MalikatFFXIII however!
[1901] PuyoDead Hallway simulator 2010
[1901] MalikatFFXIII the currency for unlocking things is CP.
[1901] TrueWolves` ... the whole game is horridly linear, XD
[1901] MalikatFFXIII hi puyo. I have no CP.
[1902] PuyoDead I stopped playing when I realized there were no towns, no open fields, just... paths.
[1902] MalikatFFXIII All character development requires CP.
[1902] TrueWolves` Hey Puyo, want to take the surveyinterview (sorry if I already asked)
[1902] MalikatFFXIII i've been kind of dismayed at the 20 minute cutscenes
[1902] PuyoDead It's like someone merged FF with Crash Bandicoot.
[1902] MalikatFFXIII but it's pretty and shiny so i go on
[1903] PuyoDead Well, I suppose I could. But I have to go to work soon, so some other time.
[1903] TrueWolves` Hell, Crash Bandicoot (in later games .) is less linear

[1903] MalikatFFXIII oh yay another big boss that will only take a minute and not require a different tactic at all.
[1903] TrueWolves` Alright, thanks Puyo.
[1903] TrueWolves` ... I was just about to ask if the bosses at least required tactics, as that might make the game intresting
[1903] PuyoDead I've pretty much given up hope for the FF games.
[1903] TrueWolves` I have no hope for this game at all now.
[1904] TrueWolves` FF12 wasn't anywhere near this bad. O.o;
[1904] PuyoDead Ehh, they require you switching between stances, but that's all.
[1904] TrueWolves` It wasn't great, but the game had some nice exploration and a grey and grey morality at least.
[1904] PuyoDead There is zero exploration in 13, sadly.
[1905] TrueWolves` So I've heard
[1905] TrueWolves` that's one of my favorate parts in FF games, almost all of them have at least semi-decent explorations.
[1905] TrueWolves` ... -s
[1905] PuyoDead Yea, I think 10 might have been the last one I really enjoyed.
[1906] TrueWolves` I found 12 to be better then when it first started when I learned to ignore anything at all that did with Vaan
[1906] TrueWolves` The rest of the game besides him is really well written.
[1906] TrueWolves` XC
[1906] MalikatFFXIII i never played 12
[1906] TrueWolves` XD 
[1906] MalikatFFXIII i enjoyed 10 a lot
[1906] MalikatFFXIII 13 is getting on my nerves
[1906] TrueWolves` Malikat, Vaan is the starting character in 12...
[1906] TrueWolves` only like
[1906] TrueWolves` he contribues almost nothing to the plot besides starting it.
[1906] MalikatFFXIII because i seriously just beat a boss just by mashing attack
[1906] TrueWolves` And just tags along for the rest of the game.
[1907] PuyoDead Yea, that's how most of the bosses are.
[1907] MalikatFFXIII 
[1907] MalikatFFXIII it forced me to use libra so i would learn the TECHNIQUES SYSTEM!!!!
[1907] MalikatFFXIII which is so COMPLICATED OMG MP THAT REGENS INCREDIBLY SLOWLY

[1908] TrueWolves` Awesome but impractical attacks
[1908] TrueWolves` Sounds norm for FF
[1909] PuyoDead Generally, the game is Walk forward  watch movie  walk around enemies, occasionally be fored to fight  hit auto attack  boss fight  switch stances every now and then  win.
[1909] MalikatFFXIII ^
[1909] MalikatFFXIII yeah.
[1909] MalikatFFXIII yeah.
[1909] MalikatFFXIII auto battle seems uh
[1909] MalikatFFXIII i kind of facepalm there

[1910] MalikatFFXIII Riverthief aye, laptop has a wireless card
[1911] PuyoDead Yea, FF6
[1911] MalikatFFXIII banelord why are you sorry
[1911] PuyoDead The real 6, that is.
[1911] MalikatFFXIII i kind of liked the datalog in 13 until i realized it updates after every cutscene with the same damn info every time
[1912] MalikatFFXIII and it uses the datalog as an excuse for horrible storytelling
[1912] MalikatFFXIII like, it keeps telling me hope haet snow
[1912] PuyoDead Ugh, yea.
[1912] Riverthief Ok, so your connection goes like this, right DESKTOP---(ethernet cable)----LAPTOP---(wireless connection)-----INTERNET
[1912] MalikatFFXIII and i'm like ... what he doesn't look like he hates snow..
[1912] MalikatFFXIII Riverthief yes sir
[1913] TrueWolves` FF6 was awesome, LOTS of exploration and LOTS of character background
[1913] PuyoDead I'm all for databases of itemsenemies and such, but it's used as the filler for the (flimsy) story.
[1913] Riverthief Ok, you near the desktop atm
[1913] MalikatFFXIII i could pause FF13 and scoot over to it

[1941] MalikatFFXIII that will be the player entity
[1941] MalikatFFXIII in the player entity folder, there will be an inventory folder
[1942] Riverthief got it
[1942] MalikatFFXIII ...unless you're not holding anything, then the player entity will only have 12 entries and there will be no inventory folder, i think. either way it's a lot easier if you're holding at least one item
[1942] Riverthief there's 0 entries in it
[1942] Riverthief Sec, I'll egt an item and re-save haha
[1942] MalikatFFXIII yeah. i don't remember the stuff you need to create an item entry
[1942] MalikatFFXIII i prefer to copy them and then change the slot value and the block type value

[1958] MalikatFFXIII if you set it sufficiently high, it acts infinite
[1959] MalikatFFXIII like, ~100+
[1959] MalikatFFXIII i usually use 255 when i want infinite, just because that's what i'm used to meaning infinite. D
