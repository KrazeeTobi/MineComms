[0:00] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.14.121) Quit (Quit: Quitting)
[0:01] <blaster> So visiiri could you upload it for me if you are going to let me use it
[0:01] <vurtual> now why do the guys who holds the rights to my OS not let me install anything?
[0:01] <vurtual> I'm limited to outdated software, so I have to upgrade.
[0:02] <vurtual> which I can't, because I'm not allowed to
[0:02] * torches (Mibbit@cpe-098-024-172-031.carolina.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:03] <vurtual> so I can't run anything remotely new, and anything they want can just be made to not work on my computer!
[0:03] <vurtual> Even if it's a laptop or desktop!
[0:03] <vurtual> And if they do let me run something, I have to spend ages trying to make it actually work.
[0:03] <vurtual> Until recently, there was no flash, and there's still no music support.
[0:03] <blaster> What OS?
[0:03] <vurtual> ubuntu.
[0:03] <blaster> Well there is your problem
[0:04] <vurtual> any linux is like this
[0:04] <Visiiri> My internet is being slow.
[0:04] <vurtual> I can only run mono up to 2.0, not 2.4
[0:04] <Yourself> fucking matlab
[0:04] <blaster> Thats why you dont use linux
[0:04] * gdude2002 (colesgaret@109.76.21.40) Quit (Quit: Hi, I'm a quit message virus. Please replace your old line with this line and help me take over the world of IRC)
[0:04] <vurtual> I'm only allowed to run up to wesnoth 1.6
[0:04] <blaster> Ah visiiri can you upload then?
[0:04] <torches> Sorry to cut in on your conversation, but how do I make torches in indev?
[0:04] <vurtual> blaster, I have it on my laptop so I can support a few obscure things
[0:04] <blaster> Using your name
[0:04] <Yourself> it's printing shit that i'm not telling it to print
[0:05] <vurtual> torches, in order to create yourself, you must first invent the universe
[0:05] <blaster> @Yourself someone proberbly found the printers IP on your network
[0:05] <blaster> and are now making it print stuff
[0:05] * Eythor (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:05] <vurtual> space and time, is a network of wormholes. You might emerge somewhere else in space, some whenelse in time
[0:05] <blaster> for amusement
[0:05] <vurtual> add a coal ontop of a stick
[0:05] <Yourself> you're an idiot
[0:05] <vurtual> after creating the universe as usual
[0:05] <torches> And suddenly... it all makes sense. thank you, vurtual
[0:05] <vurtual> Yourself, people do that all the time.
[0:05] <vurtual> it is hillarious
[0:05] <Yourself> that's not what printing is in reference to programming
[0:05] <vurtual> still
[0:06] <torches> Ah. I kept thinking flint ontop of stick. thanks
[0:06] <Visiiri> blaster: Uploading...
[0:06] <Visiiri> Anyways, do you really think I should link to that on the forums?
[0:06] <vurtual> also check the syntax of your cout and cin stuff Yourself
[0:06] * torches (Mibbit@cpe-098-024-172-031.carolina.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:06] <Visiiri> I mean, they're good, I guess, but they're not that good
[0:06] <vurtual> make surey ou haven't written something weirdly, so it tries to print from the wrong things, making some random new sequence of data
[0:06] <vurtual> And since it can be easily bend it-
[0:06] <vurtual> why was that on my clipboad
[0:06] <blaster> I could realy do with 15 of my dwarfs dying right now
[0:07] <vurtual> blaster, immigration capsule
[0:07] <vurtual> find a chasm/glowing pit
[0:07] <blaster> I have 45 in 1 1/2 years
[0:07] <vurtual> put them in a support-supported box
[0:07] * Chris|TF2 is now known as Chris220
[0:07] <vurtual> pffft man up
[0:07] <blaster> They are a drain on resources
[0:07] <blaster> Especialy since I still have a barrel issue
[0:07] <blaster> And until autum they are all useless
[0:09] <blaster> Is a 5 dwarf military ok?
[0:11] <Visiiri> blaster: http://rs857tl.rapidshare.com/cgi-bin/upload.cgi?rsuploadid=161183434366993584
[0:13] * MarkofBear (chatzilla@213-66-202-160-no30.tbcn.telia.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:13] <blaster> Error, no file choses
[0:13] <blaster> chosen
[0:13] <vurtual> 5 dwarf military not really not for your size
[0:13] <vurtual> not without a sturdy defense system
[0:13] <vurtual> and by "sturdy" I mean "can't screw up"
[0:14] <blaster> 5 rockfall traps by the door
[0:14] <blaster> and the first goblin raid has not happened yet
[0:14] <blaster> Its sort of preparation for first attack
[0:14] <vurtual> that's not sturdy
[0:14] <vurtual> you need gates and side-gates
[0:14] <blaster> Then what is?
[0:14] <blaster> I have 1 entrance, thats all
[0:14] <vurtual> Reccomended security feature: A main entrance that's at least fairly long without any incursion holes
[0:14] <vurtual> wide
[0:14] <vurtual> multiple lock types
[0:15] <Yourself> dammit, youtube
[0:16] <vurtual> Also here's an idea
[0:16] <vurtual> Have a dwarven security station
[0:16] * Roujo|Away (Roujo@modemcable186.146-70-69.static.videotron.ca) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:17] <blaster> ?
[0:17] <blaster> What would that do?
[0:17] <vurtual> Have like, a keep in your city
[0:17] <blaster> I have a bareck
[0:17] <vurtual> and build your whole city around this central keep, which should be able to be self-sufficient in case of siege, even if the fort is lost
[0:17] <blaster> I dont think I need that
[0:17] <blaster> TBH
[0:18] <vurtual> it will really help
[0:18] <vurtual> alot.
[0:18] <blaster> I need to get some of my dwarfs killed
[0:18] <vurtual> Within the keep, have an always-manned(redundancy, isolation, drunkenness) room, which has no weak points and cannot be stormed into safely.
[0:18] <vurtual> blaster, you need barrels?
[0:18] <vurtual> GET SOME CARPENTERS OUT THERE
[0:18] <blaster> Not any more
[0:18] <blaster> I am fine for barrels now
[0:18] <vurtual> see if you have any hobbyist carpenters
[0:18] <vurtual> If you need more of something, have your dwarves make it!
[0:18] <vurtual> Not enough food? Get them making food!
[0:18] <blaster> I am fine for barrels
[0:18] <blaster> Its just food production was too fast
[0:19] <blaster> But now food consumption is fast enoguh to allways give me 3-4 empty barrels
[0:19] <vurtual> yeah that can suck if you don't prepare
[0:19] <vurtual> Also, a smoothed keep would look cool
[0:19] <vurtual> dug tunnels and security bypasses and other stuff
[0:19] <vurtual> and then a gigantic, round vertical structure, entirely smoothed, full of dwarves well-prepared for action
[0:20] <Marach-14> <Konogan> when it will attain a certain number MP will be out.
[0:20] <Marach-14> <Konogan> that's what he said :P
[0:20] <Marach-14> bullshit
[0:20] <Marach-14> it's a mystery number.
[0:21] <vurtual> then if say, invaders incursion your fort, you can just hit a lever, and drawbridges seal your big exit
[0:21] <vurtual> then gates lock everywhere, and dwarves are isolated
[0:22] * NateTheGreat (Nate@RH-CypressS-CS2-138-162.njit.edu) has joined #minecraft
[0:22] <vurtual> Then, you can use a second security station to control individual side-gates.
[0:22] <NateTheGreat> Any coders around?
[0:22] <vurtual> So military can by slowly moved through a system of side-gates to reach the immediate area.
[0:22] <vurtual> NateTheGreat, what language
[0:22] <blaster> You do realise this is my first real fort
[0:22] <Yourself> coders of what?
[0:22] <NateTheGreat> doesn't matter really, vurtual
[0:22] <vurtual> C++? Python? Perl? Ruby? C? Java?
[0:22] <Konogan> Marach, trying to find it in the log.
[0:22] <NateTheGreat> I just need to figure out a trig equation that projects random particles in a cone
[0:22] <vurtual> Lua?
[0:23] <NateTheGreat> ActionScript 3
[0:23] <vurtual> that's not programming that's trigonometry
[0:23] <vurtual> ahahaha actionscript
[0:23] <Yourself> that's more of a math problem than a programming problem
[0:23] <Visiiri> Mmm, cos(1,32)^64
[0:23] <Visiiri> is your X
[0:23] <vurtual> he's gonna hacks us with his actionscripts
[0:23] <vurtual> also where's mail
[0:23] <vurtual> I miss him :(
[0:23] <Visiiri> shit actionscripts
[0:23] <Visiiri> vurtual: Mail left because of you
[0:23] <NateTheGreat> true, Yourself
[0:23] * SpaceManiac (SpaceMania@r74-192-169-79.gtwncmta01.grtntx.tl.dh.suddenlink.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:24] <Yourself> anyway, i can probably help regardless
[0:24] <NateTheGreat> also Visiiri, just my X needs to be adjusted? it's in a 360 degree scale
[0:24] <vurtual> nooo
[0:24] <NateTheGreat> I'm bad at trig :/
[0:24] <Visiiri> NateTheGreat: No, I have no idea. I haven't had a trig class in two years.
[0:24] <vurtual> I've never liked things like cosines and stuff
[0:24] <Visiiri> However, I can build spheres with trig.
[0:24] <NateTheGreat> Okay, np.
[0:24] <vurtual> Math is for numbers
[0:24] <vurtual> not patterns
[0:24] <Marach-14> me neither
[0:24] * fenixfurion is now known as fenixfurion|AFK
[0:24] <Visiiri> Math is for fucking your mom!
[0:24] <Yourself> like i said, i can help
[0:25] <Visiiri> Ohhhhhhhhh
[0:25] <vurtual> also there should be something like simple wikipedia
[0:25] <vurtual> called skimpy wikipedia
[0:25] <Yourself> need more information, though
[0:25] <vurtual> where it explains things using attractive women
[0:25] <NateTheGreat> So, Yourself, this is what I have so far:
[0:25] <blaster> vurtual? text to speech
[0:25] <NateTheGreat> math.random() * -Math.cos(angle) * speed
[0:25] <NateTheGreat> for x
[0:25] * Dog (MarkTraceu@cpe-76-174-119-97.socal.res.rr.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:25] <NateTheGreat> and same for Y, cept with sin
[0:25] <Yourself> ok
[0:26] <NateTheGreat> it works nice
[0:26] <blaster> Oh fuck my fucking dwarf which I named blaster and gave a luxury room is possesed
[0:26] * Hoit (Owner@c-24-129-63-241.hsd1.fl.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:26] <vurtual> http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_function :|
[0:26] * Balok (crytogodno@99-8-4-134.lightspeed.alhbca.sbcglobal.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:26] * Dog (MarkTraceu@cpe-76-174-119-97.socal.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:26] <NateTheGreat> except when i get near 180 and 0 degrees
[0:26] <vurtual> blaster make him happier you dude
[0:26] * Jat-afk is now known as Jat
[0:26] <vurtual> he'll never become a legendary now
[0:26] <blaster> And is making a rock thing out of stone
[0:26] <vurtual> You have to appease him
[0:26] <NateTheGreat> then the particles go straight
[0:26] <Yourself> so what is it you're trying to actually do?
[0:26] * Visiiri is now known as Vis{Conducting}
[0:26] <vurtual> APPEASE HIM
[0:26] <blaster> Rock out of bone
[0:26] <vurtual> TRAIN HIM TO BECOME THE LEGENDARY HIS MOOD SO DESIRES
[0:26] <NateTheGreat> Trying to make these particles project in a cone
[0:26] <Balok> trig is hard
[0:26] <blaster> He is pleased
[0:26] <blaster> He is estatic
[0:26] <Hoit> How am i still logged in as calhoun? Both computers lost power. How is it still connected as such?
[0:26] <Yourself> in 2D?
[0:27] <vurtual> it hasn't pinged, hoit
[0:27] <blaster> 3d
[0:27] <vurtual> /ns ghost Calhoun PASSWORD
[0:27] <Yourself> Hoit: ghost it
[0:27] <vurtual> alternately if your client is maggots: /msg nickserv ghost Calhoun PASSWORD
[0:27] <blaster> I hope its a bone statue
[0:27] <vurtual> A tall bone statue, blaster?
[0:27] <vurtual> Going to erect it somewhere?
[0:28] <vurtual> Will it protrude from a wall?
[0:28] <vurtual> Or will it tower over the forests?
[0:28] <AndrewPH> or if you're using a manly client, /ghost nick password
[0:28] <Yourself> NateTheGreat, based on what you've given me, i only see something which gives a random speed to an object in a given direction
[0:28] <Marach-14> my client is manly :3
[0:28] <blaster> No vurtual
[0:28] <Hoit> Irrsi.
[0:28] <vurtual> real men use mirc
[0:28] <NateTheGreat> that formula is applied to each individual particle, Yourself
[0:28] <Marach-14> real men use xchat
[0:28] <NateTheGreat> that is generated
[0:28] <blaster> Real men STFU and just chat
[0:28] <vurtual> no real men use mirc
[0:29] <Yourself> well, what is angle?
[0:29] <Hoit> Bah, Graphical interfaces for IRC, Blasphemy
[0:29] <AndrewPH> vurtual, so you don't use mirc?
[0:29] <Marach-14> stfu? never heard of that client
[0:29] <vurtual> I use mirc
[0:29] <vurtual> but not for you maggots
[0:29] <Marach-14> does it allow you to chat?
[0:29] <AndrewPH> but you just said that real men use mirc
[0:29] <vurtual> I have to use a more maggoty client so you maggots can handle it
[0:29] <AndrewPH> and you clearly aren't a real man
[0:29] <NateTheGreat> Okay, so how can I alter the formula to project in a cone, Yourself? Any tips?
[0:29] <blaster> Visiiri you there?
[0:29] <blaster> Your download link did not work
[0:29] <Marach-14> link to what?
[0:29] <vurtual> If not, then more than you.
[0:29] <Yourself> i don't know what you're asking
[0:29] <Dog> Real men user IRCII
[0:30] <Yourself> what do you mean "project in a cone"?
[0:30] * shapeshiftr (Mibbit@ool-44c741c6.dyn.optonline.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:30] <AndrewPH> real men punch other real men in the face
[0:30] * Marach-14 punches himself since he has no choice
[0:30] <AndrewPH> vurtual, get back to the kitchen
[0:30] <blaster> A song he made
[0:30] <Hoit> Except, Ghost doesn't work, since it's not registered.
[0:30] <blaster> Yay a gypsum coffin
[0:30] <blaster> What luck
[0:30] <AndrewPH> Hoit, register your crap
[0:30] <Marach-14> that's your fault then
[0:30] <blaster> I will use it tp bury him in
[0:31] <Schaap> just wanting to know how far along Notch is on the road to beta schedule.
[0:31] <Yourself> to me a projection is finding a point on some object that's nearest to some other point not necessarily on that surface
[0:31] * Balok (crytogodno@99-8-4-134.lightspeed.alhbca.sbcglobal.net) has left #minecraft
[0:31] <Schaap> did he already invite ppl for testing?
[0:31] <AndrewPH> Schaap, no
[0:31] <AndrewPH> if he did he would have blogged or twitter'd it
[0:31] <Schaap> Step 1 it is then
[0:31] <vurtual> yes
[0:31] <vurtual> only a few people
[0:31] <vurtual> who are NDA'd
[0:31] <Schaap> just checking
[0:32] <Schaap> so step 2
[0:32] <Schaap> cool so step 3 is on its way
[0:32] <Schaap> all i wanted to know
[0:32] <AndrewPH> derpdpepdper
[0:32] <Marach-14> ^
[0:32] <AndrewPH> vurtual is a troll, he's trololoing you
[0:33] * fenixfurion|AFK is now known as fenixfurion
[0:33] <Vis{Conducting}> MY NETZ R BEIN RAPED BYE TORRENTZ
[0:33] * fenixfurion is now known as fenixfurion|Fo3
[0:33] <Marach-14> nope
[0:33] <Vis{Conducting}> AndrewPH: Nah, vurtual speaks the truth. Notch has invited people.
[0:33] <Snowman> Stop downloading porn vis
[0:33] <blaster> The only people allowed to test minecraft is notch and ez
[0:33] <Marach-14> his answers are equally smart as the questions
[0:33] <AndrewPH> Vis{Conducting}, go away
[0:33] * Calhoun was kicked from #minecraft by Animator
[0:33] <vurtual> When might quatroking be on?
[0:33] <Marach-14> Animator: :3
[0:34] <blaster> So vis
[0:34] <NateTheGreat> Yourself: I want every particle generated to move out in a conal area
[0:34] <AndrewPH> Animator, and then notch said: LET THERE BE LIGHT
[0:34] <blaster> Your download link did not work
[0:34] <Vis{Conducting}> AndrewPH: No, I can't, I have to wait for Notch to send me the link.
[0:34] <Vis{Conducting}> http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/user/visiiri/1863436
[0:34] <Vis{Conducting}> He said he would, I must just wait.
[0:34] <blaster> I dont think I can download from groove shark
[0:34] <Yourself> so you have a range of directions you want the particles to travel in
[0:34] <NateTheGreat> right right
[0:35] <Yourself> well then the important part is how you pick angle
[0:35] <Yourself> and not how you set the velocity, which is what you gave me
[0:36] * HyperSpider (user748@c-71-225-192-101.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:36] <Dog> Velocity is speed *and* direction
[0:36] <Dog> So he was correct
[0:36] <NateTheGreat> Yeah
[0:36] <NateTheGreat> also
[0:36] <Yourself> and you want a central angle which defines the general direction of this "cone"
[0:36] <Vis{Conducting}> Slooowwwww netz
[0:36] <Vis{Conducting}> I need to get this fucking VST
[0:36] <Vis{Conducting}> but it's taking forever :( sob
[0:36] <blaster> I set up a gypsum coffin artifact for decoration
[0:36] <NateTheGreat> I want the cone to be able to be rotated
[0:37] * HyperSpider (user748@c-71-225-192-101.hsd1.nj.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: HyperSpider)
[0:37] <Yourself> the way i'd do it, is generate the velocity for the cone always pointing at angle 0
[0:37] * Furyhunter (Furyhunter@cpe-70-112-108-97.austin.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:37] <Yourself> so you pick an angle between -10 and 10 or whatever your spread is
[0:37] <Yourself> generate the velocity
[0:37] * Smashing (Smashing@adsl-178-217-10.jax.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[0:37] <Yourself> and then rotate that velocity
[0:37] <Yourself> or reverse the last two steps
[0:38] <Vis{Conducting}> Muuuust
[0:38] <Vis{Conducting}> downlooooaaaaadddd
[0:38] <Vis{Conducting}> vst
[0:38] <blaster> YES THE CARAVAN HAS ANVILS
[0:38] * Vis{Conducting} will stop spammin now.
[0:38] <Yourself> or just pick a direction in the range [heading - spread, heading + spread]
[0:38] <Yourself> that'd be the easiest way
[0:38] * Furyhunter (Furyhunter@cpe-70-112-108-97.austin.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:38] <NateTheGreat> alright I think I understand
[0:39] <NateTheGreat> Leme go try this, thanks
[0:39] * Dog is now known as MarkTraceur
[0:39] * Villor (chatzilla@83.223.16.12) Quit (Quit: ChatZilla 0.9.85 [Firefox 3.5.9/20100315083431])
[0:40] <Yourself> angle = (2*Math.random() - 1)*halfSpreadAngle + coneDirection;
[0:40] <Yourself> like that
[0:40] <bildramer> then x = cos(angle), y = -sin(angle)
[0:40] <Vis{Conducting}> Gottit
[0:40] <NateTheGreat> right right
[0:40] <bildramer> if y is up to down
[0:40] <Vis{Conducting}> Now I have a full orchestral under me
[0:41] <bildramer> loll

[0:42] <bildramer> not really, thanks
[0:42] <blaster> Guys I finaly have a metalsmith forge set up
[0:42] <bildramer> yay
[0:42] <vurtual> also it changes a bit

[0:45] <blaster> Trust me, I have 3 gigantic magnetite large clusters in plain sight
[0:45] <blaster> I dont think I will run out any time soon
[0:45] <Kingzan> That would last me about... 20 minutes?
[0:45] <Kingzan> :)
[0:46] <blaster> If I just dug it all out yes
[0:46] <blaster> But I dont need to make that many things
[0:46] <blaster> Mostly making weapons and armor for my millitary
[0:46] <blaster> Then some random shit from platinum
[0:47] <vurtual> blaster, it won't last long
[0:47] <vurtual> outfitting a dwarf requires many bars
[0:47] <vurtual> or a big chunk of that magnetite
[0:47] <vurtual> multiple bars per body piece

[1:46] <vurtual> seriously
[1:46] <vurtual> This is the second time a bug has resulted into an enemy in a game turning itno a pillar of blood
[1:46] <CruelNoise> and isn't composure something about your facial expression?
[1:46] <Visiiri> Erm, GrooveShark is what I use to host my music.
[1:46] <Visiiri> No, music, good sir.
[1:47] <vurtual> the first time was in jc2, with a overpowered super mod gun turning an enemy into a vertical blood effect as their ragdoll leaves bounds
[1:47] <Visiiri> You compose an orchestral.
[1:47] <CruelNoise> do you mean composition?
[1:47] <Visiiri> No
[1:47] <Visiiri> Well, probably.
[1:47] <vurtual> now in the specialists, I had lagged for a moment, so the blood splatter effect for someone was still there for a moment, but they had been re-adjusted out of my view
[1:47] <Visiiri> But I'm calling it composure.
[1:47] <Visiiri> Stf.
[1:47] <Visiiri> errr
[1:47] <Visiiri> fail.

[1:49] <CruelNoise> that makes sense, but, whatever
[1:50] <vurtual> not really, why can't we just keep that extra?
[1:50] <CruelNoise> what does it mean by real-life strategy?
[1:50] <vurtual> CruelNoise, it's a bit real life like
[1:50] <CruelNoise> ...
[1:50] <CruelNoise> orly?
[1:50] <vurtual> you're a countertrorrist organizatino, who has to, step-by-step, plan and execute
[1:50] <vurtual> various objectives
[1:50] <CruelNoise> you get to plan?
[1:50] <CruelNoise> interesting
[1:50] <vurtual> Like, sneaking into a terrorist-held house and rescuing hostages
[1:50] <Visiiri> Yeah, most of Tom Clancy's games are pretty realistic.

[1:51] <CrazySpai> Afternoon!
[1:51] <Dommys> It should be Legal to kill in-laws
[1:51] <vurtual> You can also have ones to indicate waiting for a radio command
[1:51] <CruelNoise> visiiri
[1:51] <CruelNoise> give me a link to your musix

[1:52] <EmpiresBane> that's a lot better. i hate having to deal with thye retarded "plans" that my "superiors" scribbled on a napkin while they were wasted
[1:52] <vurtual> And you could equip people with different weapons and items in each slot, different camos and armors, and divide your 4 players into any number of teams
[1:52] <Dommys> I played Rainbow Six LAN for years
[1:52] <Dommys> lol
[1:52] <CruelNoise> interesting
[1:53] <vurtual> If you need to bust into the white house and rescue hostages from the oval office, you can just split into two teams, and in your plan, have the other one wait at the one door, while you go around for the other
[1:53] <CruelNoise> neato
[1:53] <vurtual> then, you radio bravo/alpha/whatever, and then bust in, and then after hearing you radio that, they'll continue on their path too, so you can have a simeltaneous breaching of a room by multiple sides

[1:54] <Visiiri> I've never understood why they don't just barricade doors and pump in sleeping gas.
[1:54] <vurtual> sleep gas takes a long time to take effect
[1:54] <vurtual> enough time to shoot hostages
[1:54] <vurtual> or shoot the walls
[1:54] <vurtual> or apply gasmasks
[1:54] <Visiiri> MORE sleeping gas?
[1:54] <Dommys> Or detonate C4
[1:54] <CruelNoise> penisgas
[1:54] <CruelNoise> instakillgas
[1:55] <vurtual> hp restore grenades
[1:55] <Visiiri> Nah, flashbangs are ftw
[1:55] <vurtual> but, what if I want extra mags for both weapons, Visiiri?
[1:55] <vurtual> Or a heartbeat sensor+extra mags, or frags+extra mags?
[1:55] <Visiiri> z o m g 97%
[1:55] <vurtual> Also opening doors in rainbow six almost always played a musical cue
[1:55] <vurtual> that was really tense
[1:55] <vurtual> even if you just opened and closed a door repeatedly it'd be like
[1:55] <CruelNoise> visiiri, give me a link to music
[1:55] <vurtual> DUNNN DUNNNNNNN
[1:55] <Visiiri> Hold on a moment
[1:55] <Visiiri> it's not done

[2:24] <MarkTraceur> vede: I can't save, for example...if I try to, it won't take the mouse back

[2:25] <vede> (You'll have to restart and load from the save to keep playing, though.)
[2:25] <MarkTraceur> vede: Exactly.
[2:25] <Azathoth> fuck that. i don't give loose change to homeless people on the street
[2:25] <vede> Notch needs to fix it 4srs.

[2:28] <vede> Xonotic/Nexuiz, Sauerbraten, Battle for Wesnoth, POWDER, Rogue, Blood Frontier.
[2:29] <EmpiresBane> as it is mainly a bunch of people with lacking social skills trying to socialize

[2:32] <Azathoth> ^
[2:32] <Dommys> I was more surprised that he shot himself, before shooting anyone else.
[2:32] <EmpiresBane> if you slowly take it

[2:34] <NateTheGreat> this is in actionscript 3

[3:28] <vurtual> I'd paint one in some kind of SWAT-style camo and put lights all over it.
[3:28] <vurtual> inward-facing lights
[3:28] <Azathoth> this thread makes me want to mod nerf guns
[3:28] <Azathoth> i'd fucking install ammo counters
[3:28] <Azathoth> i'm not exactly sure how, but it could probably be done :P
[3:28] <vurtual> Semi-auto nerf pistols to dual wield!
[3:28] <vurtual> a spring
[3:29] <vurtual> that feels pressure of the darts being inside
[3:29] <Azathoth> yeah
[3:29] <vurtual> then that uses a computer to send data to the gun
[3:29] <Azathoth> actually, i'm kinda surprised there aren't any guns with ammo counters on them already
[3:29] <vurtual> Also, I have a real scope still
[3:29] <Azathoth> it doesn't seem like that hard of a thing to make

[3:29] * Bashur|Sleeping is now known as Bashur
[3:29] <vurtual> I can figure out how people mod them for extra power
[3:29] <Azathoth> CO2 :D
[3:29] <vurtual> and then crank the power to max
[3:29] <vurtual> and then, fit the scope on
[3:29] <vurtual> zero it
[3:29] <vurtual> go hunting
[3:30] <Azathoth> they probalby put in crazy springs and stuff
[3:30] <vurtual> for rabbits
[3:30] <Firetempest> i have a few nerf mavericks i wanted to paint, but so far the only mod I've done is removed noise suppression for more power and clip fully extends to load more at once
[3:30] <Azathoth> i want to mod a nerf gun to use CO2, then it could be semi-automatic
[3:30] <Azathoth> and pretty powerful, but i'm not sure how accurate nerf darts would be

[3:40] <vurtual> IF, and IF a nerf gun is easy to dissasemble for me
[3:40] <vurtual> Then I'll take off all the outer plastic, and spraypaint it
[3:40] <vurtual> black and dark red or silver and red or something.
[3:40] <Firetempest> depends on the gun. but most are pretty simple
[3:40] <Azathoth> i'm seriously starting to wonder how hard it would be to come up with some kind of co2 firing mechanism for a nerf gun
[3:41] <vurtual> then get some cheap materials and make stuff like two pistol holsters, and a sling for a rifle.
[3:41] <Azathoth> it would probably involve the cannibalization of a paintball gun
[3:41] <vurtual> Then sling a rifle onto my back, and dual wield pistols
[3:41] <Firetempest> the maverick is touted as the easiest and cheapest to try moding first.
[3:41] <Azathoth> what calibre are nerf rounds?
[3:41] <vurtual> and get a bandolier
[3:42] <vurtual> Are there any semi-auto pistols, beside cheap knockoff brands, Firetempest?
[3:42] <vurtual> not actually thinking about immediately spraypainting them
[3:42] <LG_Legacy> I'm hearing something about nerf guns?
[3:42] <Azathoth> yea
[3:42] <vurtual> also how horrible is this supposed to be (longstrike CS-6): http://www.hasbro.com/common/productimages/en_US/95a5406a19b9f3691056599796f84ba9/95AB85C719B9F369101064C2B0FA8747.jpg
[3:43] <LG_Legacy> I want a longshot
[3:43] <LG_Legacy> If thats what they're called.
[3:43] <Azathoth> are nerf rounds half an inch thick?
[3:43] <Azathoth> that's a pretty cool one
[3:43] <vurtual> some of the snipery-weapons are apparently inconsistently functional
[3:43] <AlexVMiner> >:D
[3:43] <Azathoth> and yeah. the longshot is awesome
[3:44] <vurtual> also are those rails I see
[3:44] <Azathoth> yes, i think
[3:44] <Azathoth> i'm pretty sure the long shot comes with some rail attachments
[3:44] <vurtual> that's the longstrike
[3:44] <Azathoth> like a laser
[3:44] <vurtual> which is nearly the same thing but not
[3:44] <LG_Legacy> I want a long shot
[3:44] <LG_Legacy> And then i want to paint it
[3:44] <vurtual> the longshot has things like bipods and stuff
[3:44] <vurtual> and the pistol-shape
[3:44] <Azathoth> yea
[3:45] <vurtual> while the longstrike is the generic SKS-shaped one
[3:45] <Azathoth> the longshot is modular
[3:45] <ILM> I heard "longshot" and the first thing I thought of was the water temple

[4:00] <Azathoth> i mean
[4:00] <Azathoth> yea
[4:00] <Azathoth> shooting people is one thing, but pretending to sword fight with big foam swords is kinda childish :P
[4:00] <vurtual> I actually am a trained sword user
[4:01] <Azathoth> i'd rather just use a wooden sword or something
[4:01] <vurtual> so basically if i hit anyone they'll have a mark
[4:01] <vurtual> I have wooden swords, but they shatter if I hit anything
[4:01] <vurtual> Even if I do things like duct-tape them so they absorb impacts
[4:01] <Azathoth> your wood isn't hard enough
[4:01] <Azathoth> if you know what i mean
[4:01] <vurtual> I do have a wooden shield I cut out of plywood or something and spraypainted, with trap grips
[4:01] <Azathoth> sounds ghetto

[4:02] <Azathoth> i mean they're not made of metal or anything
[4:03] <Azathoth> if you can shatter wood on impact, you can probalby snap one of those in half pretty easily
[4:03] <vurtual> it's foam
[4:03] <vurtual> not hard wood
[4:03] <Azathoth> i didn't say that was wood
[4:03] <Azathoth> but you said you break your wood swords
[4:03] <vurtual> yes, wood is hard
[4:03] <vurtual> it has fibers and can split
[4:03] <AzureAngelic> oh god damnit why do i always build my stuff in the wrong place :(

[4:11] <vurtual> yes too old for a zombie apocalypse when I was 0
[4:11] <vurtual> what?
[4:11] <AndrewPH> yeah
[4:11] <vurtual> Also here's an awesome idea. Make tf2 nerf guns
[4:11] <Azathoth> how can you be too old for a zombie apocalypse/

[4:11] <Azathoth> i'm going to make an m41a pulse rifle nerf gun

[4:12] <vurtual> I want to make a nerf pipe launcher, sticky launcher, and then a nerf sword eyelander and run around screaming in a half-scottish accent
[4:12] <Firetempest> its best to make your own nerf sword. pvc piping with a pool noodle, ductape, and wail.
[4:12] <vurtual> woah
[4:12] <Azathoth> put a copper pipe or something in the center
[4:13] <Azathoth> to keep it stiff and give it some ballance

[4:22] <coladash> theres a mod for that though

[4:22] <Azathoth> lol
[4:23] <Azathoth> or the terrorist who tried to fire an RPG standing up
[4:23] <Azathoth> and flew backwards like 10 feet

[4:23] <vurtual> wait
[4:23] <coladash> and tf2 and css
[4:23] <vurtual> you're not supposed to fire them standing up?
[4:23] <vurtual> What about backblast?

[4:23] <Dommys> Anyone need anything
[4:23] <vurtual> is it one of those anti-air modded ones?
[4:23] <Azathoth> it was a "recoilless rifle"

[4:24] <Dommys> Check will be good tomorrow. lol
[4:24] <Dommys> Just no moniez today
[4:24] <vurtual> they don't really recoil Azathoth
[4:24] <vurtual> unless it's one of those anti-helicopter ones with the funnel, which may make you backflip
[4:24] <Azathoth> yeah
[4:24] <Superwafflez> oh wow new sniping record
[4:24] <vurtual> they can be used casually and easily
[4:25] <Azathoth> i think it was an anti air one
[4:25] <vurtual> given a good design, and ignoring the actual weight, you could fire it one-handed.
[4:25] <vurtual> you'd need the strength to dual wield a desert eagle to hold it up
[4:25] <vurtual> and nobody's that good
[4:26] <Azathoth> Despite the name, it is rare for the forces to completely balance, and real world recoilless rifles do recoil noticeably (with varying degrees of severity).
[4:26] <vurtual> work harder at designing them
[4:26] <Azathoth> anyway the guy was not braced at all
[4:26] <vurtual> add rockets
[4:26] <Azathoth> like he was standing casually
[4:27] <Azathoth> dumb terrorists
[4:27] <vurtual> the ones designed to funnel the blast upwards have an intense recoil iirc
[4:27] <vurtual> Imagine the guys who have to invent these
[4:27] <vurtual> And one guy's a skeptic, so he braces for a serious blast sending him backwards
[4:27] <vurtual> and it recoils the opposite, sending him forward.
[4:28] <vurtual> who needs laws of thermodynamics anyways
[4:28] <Azathoth> apparently that can happen if the round gets stuck in the tube

[4:31] <vurtual> the only "recoil" is the blast from the explosion itself, which allows you to fly.
[4:31] <vurtual> Unless it's a tau cannon. Then recoil is wonderful.
[4:31] <Azathoth> tau guns are most rail guns
[4:31] <Azathoth> mostly*
[4:31] <vurtual> that recoil hard enough to make you fly
[4:32] <vurtual> very, very far.
[4:32] <vurtual> You can use the charge control to fire a weaker shot and just clear 1-2 stories
[4:33] <vurtual> or launch yourself up a skyscraper. Or up into the air, then pick someone off, and maybe land safely
[4:33] <Azathoth> lol
[4:33] <Azathoth> basically rocket jumping
[4:33] <vurtual> no
[4:33] <Azathoth> only using the recoil instead of the blast
[4:33] <vurtual> Not the backblast, the recoil
[4:33] <vurtual> It's majorly different for a few reasons, including being able to direct yourself at any angle
[4:33] <vurtual> and the ability to fire another shot in midair
[4:33] <vurtual> and literally fly.
[4:33] <Shadaez> vurtual doens't understand physics?
[4:34] <vurtual> Shadaez, what part of physics is broken?
[4:34] <Azathoth> sounds like it could get pretty dangerous, possibly causing a little bit of collateral damage and death
[4:34] <vurtual> just learn to shoot on landing so you slow down, Azathoth.
[4:34] <Azathoth> collateral damage
[4:34] <Azathoth> as in
[4:34] <Azathoth> you have to keep firing powerful shots to stay in the air :P
[4:34] <Azathoth> they have to hit somewhere
[4:35] <Shadaez> the amount of force required to launch someone up isn't going to be produced by firing anything that you can hold in your hand
[4:35] <vurtual> yeah, concrete
[4:35] <Azathoth> also it would be painful as fuck for the person firing it
[4:35] <vurtual> It's a railgun and follows the railgun of "see how many enemies you can hit before it hits concrete"
[4:36] <vurtual> also, hev suit
[4:36] <Firetempest> i think he has the cavestory machine gun in his head.
[4:36] <Azathoth> and would probably liquify your brains :P
[4:36] <Azathoth> hev suit or not
[4:36] <vurtual> that's probably one of the five actual functions of the hev suit
[4:36] <vurtual> recoil absorption, jumping things, a flashlight, a health hud, and shielding
[4:36] <vurtual> Also, it's technically an anti-tank weapon, too.
[4:37] <Azathoth> it would probalby just break the suit's arm off
[4:37] <vurtual> one shot can take out a helicopter
[4:37] <Azathoth> helicopters aren't even very heavily armored

[4:38] <ILM> What are we talking about now?
[4:38] <vurtual> the tau cannon from half-life
[4:38] <Azathoth> tau rail guns are supposed to basically be able to pierce right through a tank and then basically suck everything out
[4:39] <Azathoth> oh
[4:39] <Azathoth> that tau cannon
[4:39] <vurtual> making the helicopter just smash into the ground because the engine is probably melting, or got shot out the side due to force.

[4:40] <ILM> Oh, now I remember!

[4:41] <Azathoth> somehow i don't think depleted uranium would be much use for anything other than the actual projectile

[4:42] <Azathoth> because it's dense
[4:42] <Naxza> No, but not very reactive is still a threat to water and food supplies.
[4:42] <Azathoth> not a very big threat apparently
[4:42] <vurtual> black mesa could take a shiny chunk of cheese and cause the apocalypse
[4:42] <Azathoth> During a three week period of conflict in 2003 in Iraq, 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes of DU munitions were used, mostly in cities
[4:42] <vurtual> I'm pretty sure makign a laser that uses depleted uranium isn't that impossible for them

[4:47] <vurtual> yeah it'd play like the old rainbow six
[4:47] <Shadaez> Nexza it is, but you don't need it after it's installed and updateed.
[4:47] <Azathoth> and you fight vortigaunts?
[4:47] <vurtual> and you're HECU and other force types, fighting during events before the seven hour war
[4:47] <Azathoth> and stuff
[4:47] <Azathoth> ah
[4:47] <vurtual> now instead of terrorists it's space terrorists. And lots of normal terrorists.
[4:47] <Azathoth> would be interesting
[4:47] <Naxza> First people pronounce my nickname wrong, now they misspell it? It's only five letters!
[4:48] <Naxza> =P
[4:48] <Azathoth> except the game would have to be very poorly balanced to stay true to the background material :P
[4:48] <Azathoth> considering it was a 7 hour war

[4:51] <Darkebrz> What game?
[4:51] <Naxza> System Shock 2.
[4:51] <Shadaez> yeah
[4:51] <Naxza> Sounds unethical, but I just might consider it.
[4:51] <Shadaez> that's how I heard of it
[4:51] <vurtual> that's piracy
[4:51] <vurtual> well it's bad
[4:52] <CrazySpai> I hate Wikipedia so much
[4:52] <vurtual> CrazySpai nobody likes you know
[4:52] <Naxza> I love Wikipedia.
[4:52] <vurtual> you did it in one sentence
[4:52] <CrazySpai> I <3 wikipedia, but I hate it at the same time
[4:52] <vurtual> you extremist terrorist freedom hater!
[4:52] <Shadaez> they're both files that are available freely bythe company
[4:52] <Naxza> My school hates Wikipedia because there's a chance that incorrect data may be on the site for a whole three minutes.

[4:52] <Darkebrz> Yeah, it is not piracy

[4:54] <Naxza> I don't have Gmod. T_T
[4:54] <Darkebrz> You aren't sane then

[4:55] <Darkebrz> melibe, then you are weird
[4:55] <Naxza> You know what? You should buy me Gmod and re-sanify me.
[4:55] <melibe> what, is someone asking about what to buy on steam?

[4:55] <CrazySpai> So many links
[4:55] <Azathoth> bioshock basically took away one of the best things about system shock games: mysterious derelict spacecraft, and replaced it with a boring retro 40s style piece of shit
[4:55] <Darkebrz> Pretty much anything to be honest
[4:56] <vurtual> I WILL WEAR TAU CANNONS ON MY FEET
[4:56] <Naxza> Azathoth- 40's style derelict underwater utopia too boring for you?
[4:56] <melibe> hold on, my internet is being a bitch
[4:56] * vurtual jumps off a cliff faster than the speed of sound, blowing up the cliff
[4:56] <Azathoth> and then they took all the gameplay elements of system shock 2 and dumbed them down to appeal to their target audience of 12 year olds
[4:56] <melibe> but I will pass you a youtube link in just a second
[4:56] <Azathoth> i can't stand the bioshock setting. it's awful
[4:56] <CrazySpai> SHIIIIII

[5:47] <Trapiki> :D
[5:47] <Trapiki> I'm trying to populate it with more trees now
[5:47] <Christoph> I think I flooded a large series of underground caves building the canal. I was testing the water flow, and it all kept disappearing somewhere.
[5:48] <Christoph> That's important.
[5:48] <Trapiki> oh ew :C
[5:48] <Christoph> Nothing worse than running out of wood.

[5:50] <Naxza> Did you find magma, too?
[5:50] <shapeshiftr> mmhm.
[5:50] <Christoph> It only takes one damn hole somewhere in the cave to continously flood everything.

[6:00] <Naxza> Hhmmm.. Doom or L4D2?
[6:01] <AzureAngelic> if you're buying one, l4d2

[6:01] <Darkebrz> Now I can act like an epic nerd to my friends
[6:01] <Darkebrz> With math tricks
[6:01] <Visiiri> :D
[6:01] <Visiiri> I do that all the time
[6:01] <AzureAngelic> oh wow, i lost a LOT of progress
[6:01] <AzureAngelic> sigh
[6:01] <Naxza> Playing one, yeah.
[6:01] <AzureAngelic> at least i know where the magma is quicker
[6:02] <Naxza> Scoredoom + Community chest 2, heck yes.
[6:02] <AzureAngelic> i was never really into doom
[6:02] <AzureAngelic> but wolfenstien was my first fps
[6:02] <AzureAngelic> and only, until team fortress 2
[6:02] <Zaneo> So anybody know any interesting minecraft servers? like modded ones (aside from Theones stuff)
[6:03] <Animator> No custom server discussion.
[6:03] <AzureAngelic> anybody know how the random number generator works in DF?
[6:03] <outsomnia> We would, most of them are listed in the RULES.
[6:04] <AzureAngelic> like say, i get 7 migrants and then flood my base with magma
[6:04] <AzureAngelic> and reset to the last save
[6:04] <Zaneo> lame
[6:04] <AzureAngelic> will i get 7 migrants again?

[6:05] <Zaneo> I thought it was just no talking about hacks, my bad
[6:06] <Visiiri> Guize guize custom zervers
[6:06] <Visiiri> lets haha haha talk bout tem
[6:06] <shapeshiftr> :O banhammar
[6:06] <Darkebrz> Vanilla is where it is at
[6:06] <Visiiri> I miss when vanilla was the only type of server
[6:06] <Visiiri> and nobody had hacks
[6:06] <Darkebrz> same
[6:06] <Naxza> I haven't played multiplayer in months, actually.
[6:06] <Darkebrz> I want to make a completely vanilla server w/o hacks
[6:07] <Visiiri> Do it Darkebrz
[6:07] <Darkebrz> But I'm to lazy to reset my router
[6:07] <Visiiri> do it
[6:07] <Zaneo> Well there are some interesting gamemodes, i wouldn't really call them hacks
[6:07] <Darkebrz> Because for whatever reason my mom changed the password on the router
[6:07] <Dommys> I want to make a completely modified server with hacks
[6:07] <Darkebrz> But doesnt know what it is
[6:07] <outsomnia> I would though.

[6:07] <Darkebrz> And seriously EVERYONE has the same router as I also
[6:07] <Dommys> wrt54gl?
[6:07] <Darkebrz> Of course
[6:08] <Dommys> Flashed firmware?
[6:08] <Dommys> Or stock?
[6:08] <Darkebrz> I don't know
[6:08] <Zaneo> i have a 2701HG-G
[6:08] <Darkebrz> ._.
[6:08] <Dommys> Stock.
[6:08] <Darkebrz> Okay yeah stock
[6:08] <MarkTraceur> I have a Trendnet TEW-6528RP....
[6:08] <Darkebrz> I know how to reset it but then I have a lot of other shit to do
[6:08] <Zaneo> Mine is a router/modem
[6:08] <Darkebrz> Like recreate a WIP code
[6:08] <Zaneo> all in one
[6:08] <Darkebrz> Then add them to laptop and shit
[6:08] <MarkTraceur> Oooh, Zaneo, fancy
[6:09] <Zaneo> I have two the bell guy forgot to take the extra back
[6:09] <MarkTraceur> I do have a switch on the other side of the room for various other devices... *shrug*
[6:09] <Darkebrz> It is sad that in this day a vanilla server is original
[6:09] <LuciferZ> It's sad that Vanilla is so feature weak that it has become so abandoned.

[6:09] <Visiiri> LuciferZ: What features?
[6:10] <Darkebrz> What features are needed?
[6:10] <Visiiri> I think that cMss is good enough for features.
[6:10] <LuciferZ> Anti-grief
[6:10] <shapeshiftr> multi-maps
[6:10] <Darkebrz> Why?
[6:10] <shapeshiftr> custom blocks
[6:10] <Zaneo> portals

[6:10] <Dommys> You all smell funny
[6:10] <Dommys> I prefer to play alone.
[6:10] <shapeshiftr> haha
[6:10] <Visiiri> You know what REAL anti grief is?
[6:10] <LuciferZ> Darkebrz, I wasn't aware that only rich kids value their buildings
[6:10] <Visiiri> It's called an 'op'
[6:11] <Dommys> SINGLE PLAYER =/= AntiGrief
[6:11] <Darkebrz> LuciferZ, if you disable hacks then have good op(s) then you wont have to worry about griefing
[6:11] <LuciferZ> And Visiiri, did you know that ops sleep too?
[6:11] <Dommys> Unless you happen to be a Douchebag
[6:11] <shapeshiftr> but you cant make every guest op...
[6:11] <Dommys> :D
[6:11] <LuciferZ> Darkebrz
[6:11] <Darkebrz> Then shut it down at night :o
[6:11] <LuciferZ> Hacks are impossible to disable
[6:11] <Visiiri> LuciferZ: Then build with awake ops.
[6:11] <Darkebrz> Or make backups!
[6:11] <Visiiri> LuciferZ: Disabled with ops.
[6:11] <LuciferZ> No, they aren't
[6:11] <Dommys> Ban on Hack
[6:11] <Dommys> = Hack Disabled
[6:11] <LuciferZ> There are clients that will wreck any vanilla server
[6:11] <Darkebrz> Mmhmm
[6:11] <Zaneo> Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of eldeberries
[6:11] <shapeshiftr> LuciferZ - put -hax in the MotD
[6:11] <Darkebrz> Which is why it's also a private server
[6:12] <LuciferZ> Doesn't work on special clients.
[6:12] <Dommys> Now go away, or I shall taunt you a second time.
[6:12] <Darkebrz> shapeshiftr, you are and idiot
[6:12] <shapeshiftr> ?
[6:12] <Darkebrz> but yeah
[6:12] <LuciferZ> Private servers are not a solution
[6:12] <Darkebrz> When I feel like resetting the router
[6:12] <Darkebrz> I'll set up a vanilla server
[6:12] <Darkebrz> The MOST it will have is a backup script
[6:12] <Visiiri> I should try aswell.
[6:12] <LuciferZ> Turning off your server when you can't protect it is not a solution
[6:12] <Darkebrz> ...How isn't it?
[6:12] <LuciferZ> They're sacrifices.
[6:12] <Visiiri> LuciferZ: Who are sacrifices?
[6:13] <Zaneo> Private servers?
[6:13] <LuciferZ> Visiiri: Who are stupid question?
[6:13] <LG_Legacy> Too bad there isn't some trusted list that we can hire people to watch over our servers. [/Ignorance]
[6:13] <Dommys> Can't deface what you can't access
[6:13] <shapeshiftr> Guys, this is like saying "Who needs NT-based OSs? DOS works just fine!"
[6:13] <Cial> well the best way ive seen to stop griefers cant be mentioned in this channel
[6:13] <Darkebrz> Anyways it will probably be fixed once Notch adds hack protection into the game
[6:13] <Darkebrz> Then griefers get banned and they can't make alts
[6:13] <Darkebrz> Cial, why not?
[6:13] <shapeshiftr> what if you want a public server where anyone can build?
[6:13] <Dommys> I will work as admin on your server, for $12 US/hour plus benifits.
[6:13] <LuciferZ> It probably won't. Hacks will always be a step ahead of protection
[6:13] <LG_Legacy> Lol
[6:14] <Darkebrz> shapeshiftr, I don't LIKE custom servers
[6:14] <Naxza> I'll do minimum wage per hour.
[6:14] <Darkebrz> All the features detract from the building
[6:14] <LG_Legacy> Just range ban their ass :l
[6:14] <LuciferZ> Not really, Darkebrz
[6:14] <LuciferZ> No one has to use their feature.s
[6:14] <Dommys> I will work for 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[6:14] <shapeshiftr> how? they just help preserve and make easier
[6:14] <Darkebrz> They get rid of the fun of making scaffolding to create large structures
[6:14] <LG_Legacy> Unless it's dynamic of the first range
[6:14] <Visiiri> what the hell is this
[6:14] <shapeshiftr> no...
[6:14] <Cial> well then Dark you wont care for my option

[6:14] <Visiiri> WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
[6:14] <Zaneo> Legacy i think there should be a global list like that, not necessarily with those function but it's a good idea

[6:16] <Darkebrz> Also, if I enable hacks on a vanilla server then it's just griefing
[6:16] <Snake> doop
[6:16] <LuciferZ> Even if they don't interact with you

[6:17] <Zaneo> Or knife hacks
[6:17] <Visiiri> The only thing I notice right now is fucking trojans attacking me.
[6:17] <Visiiri> BBL.
[6:17] <Cial> i have a stupid question
[6:17] <Zaneo> I get kicked for legit M24 kills
[6:17] <Dommys> Visiiri , you are so sexy
[6:17] <LuciferZ> There is no relation between a hacker in a competive game and a hacker in minecraft
[6:17] <Darkebrz> LuciferZ, yes there is
[6:17] <shapeshiftr> I think Darkebrz is saying that when he works so hard doing something the classic way, and he sees someone just flying around and building an equally as detailed thing in 2 seconds, it kinda makes his structure feel less special.
[6:17] <Darkebrz> shapeshiftr, pretty much
[6:17] <LuciferZ> Aww, I am so sad for him.
[6:17] <shapeshiftr> Darkebrz: isn't internal satisfaction good enough?
[6:17] <Visiiri> LuciferZ: Go troll somewhere else.
[6:17] <Darkebrz> Structures are much more amazing and satisfying to finish when they are done without hacks
[6:17] <Cial> why does every one get pissed at people playing how they want to in a SANDBOX game?
[6:17] <Snake> Isn't hack discussion a no in here?
[6:17] <Darkebrz> shapeshiftr, depends who you are.
[6:18] <LG_Legacy> Visiiri
[6:18] <LuciferZ> Visiiri, go troll somewhere else.
[6:18] <LG_Legacy> Thats enough
[6:18] <Wervyn> That's because Darkebrz is an envious tard.
[6:18] <Darkebrz> Wervyn, what?
[6:18] <Darkebrz> Way to flame out of nowhere.
[6:18] <shapeshiftr> lol
[6:18] <Wervyn> Seriously. Be satisfied in your own creations. Don't worry about what other people are doing.
[6:18] <Visiiri> :| And you don't see how he is completely attacking Darkebrz
[6:18] <LuciferZ> Darkebrz, can you look at a building and tell if hacks built it?
[6:18] <Zaneo> Well then you get to some stuff where you want to build, but you don't want to be working for a week, falling off your structure every five seconds
[6:18] <LG_Legacy> It's mild arguing
[6:18] <Cial> kiddies play nice or go the hell outside
[6:18] <Darkebrz> LuciferZ, yeah, pretty much every building now was made with hacks.
[6:18] <Dommys> LG, it's flaming.
[6:18] <shapeshiftr> zaneo, if you're good, you don't fall
[6:18] <Visiiri> As I read it, "Aww, I am so sad for him."
[6:18] <Dommys> "I disagree with your opinion" is argument
[6:18] <shapeshiftr> I used no hacks for the first month.
[6:19] <Visiiri> That doesn't contribute to the arguement.
[6:19] <LuciferZ> So then, Darkebrz, you assume that everything was built by hacks?
[6:19] <Dommys> "You're an idiot" is flaming
[6:19] <Snake> Darkebrz: Thats a stupid way of putting it.
[6:19] <Cial> not if you lag shapeshiftr
[6:19] <Snake> That's*
[6:19] <Visiiri> *argument
[6:19] <LG_Legacy> Why don't i see a problem wit hthis?
[6:19] <shapeshiftr> if you lag, you need a new computer :P
[6:19] <Zaneo> Have you tried building a 128 long republic frigate with no fly hacks?
[6:19] <LG_Legacy> Better idea
[6:19] <LG_Legacy> Animator Thoughts?
[6:19] * Cial uses hacks to build
[6:19] <Visiiri> D:< for fucks sakes
[6:19] <Naxza> Now you're just yelling at each other.
[6:19] <Darkebrz> I remember my first few weeks of playing, which was right before the introduction of hacks. I was one of the first hackers actually. Those first few weeks were the best, participating with an entire server just to perhaps build a bridge.

[6:20] <Darkebrz> Snake, I can and do
[6:20] <Cial> no not really
[6:20] <Snake> Good
[6:20] <shapeshiftr> that was one fucked-up cartridge
[6:20] <Darkebrz> That doesn't mean I still can't rant about them
[6:20] <LuciferZ> Darkebrz, you're applying sweeping generalizations to people who use hacks
[6:20] <Wervyn> Because they're offenses against God and nature and everyone should play the game the same way, don't you understand?!
[6:20] <Cial> they are more mods than hacks
[6:20] <LuciferZ> And that doesn't seem very fair
[6:20] <LG_Legacy> I still want a Longshot
[6:20] <Visiiri> Err
[6:20] <Visiiri> It's not free
[6:21] <Darkebrz> "Well why don't you republicans just go play in your own country?"
[6:21] <Visiiri> and the trojans are attacking now
[6:21] <LG_Legacy> Visiiri
[6:21] <Darkebrz> Wervyn, shut the fuck up
[6:21] <LuciferZ> I use hacks because I do not enjoy the scaffolding, or especially the process. Is that so wrong?
[6:21] <LG_Legacy> Use home edition
[6:21] <LG_Legacy> It's free
[6:21] <Wervyn> People shouldn't be allowed to build stuff in any other way than one block at a time!
[6:21] <Darkebrz> LuciferZ, what generalizations am I applying?
[6:21] <shapeshiftr> I have to go.
[6:21] <shapeshiftr> later all.
[6:21] <Zaneo> I hate pillaring so i use fly
[6:21] <Cial> ugh this is like the Spanish inquisition and Crusades all in one
[6:21] <LG_Legacy> Guys if you're going to bring god into this, take it into #religion

[6:22] <Snake> Darkebrz: You see a building. You think it's amazing. The person who built it enters the server. You ask him if it was made with hacks. He says yes. Are you going to say that now the creation is any less amazing as when you first saw it? I think not.

[6:22] <LG_Legacy> Strangely enough, i can see why people dislike hacks with a amazing building.
[6:22] <Snake> That's pathetic.
[6:22] <Wervyn> I think that makes him shallow, yeah.
[6:22] <LuciferZ> That is sad! That's ridiculous.
[6:22] <Darkebrz> Why?
[6:22] <Naxza> C'mon guys, let's go throw a party in #religion
[6:22] <Trapiki> I only use flying hacks
[6:22] <Darkebrz> It makes me shallow because I think hacks eliminates all the challenge of the game?
[6:22] <PuyoDead> Took less work, therefore, less impressive.
[6:22] <Dommys> ^
[6:22] <LG_Legacy> Hacks itself gives less effort and work amongst building things, while without hacks it takes longer and is more rewarding in the long work.
[6:22] <PuyoDead> Pretty simple concept.
[6:23] <Visiiri> No, really. Darkebrz is right. Imagine a cave man coding an OS.
[6:23] <Wervyn> I honestly don't understand people who think that effort for effort's sake is meaningful.
[6:23] <Dommys> ABSOLUTELY simple.
[6:23] <Trapiki> To biuld my trees they way i do would be impossible to do without flying
[6:23] <Darkebrz> Exactly PuyoDead
[6:23] <LuciferZ> Okay, I'm going to come right out and say it
[6:23] <Visiiri> Imagine Stephen Hawking coding the same thing.
[6:23] <Dommys> If you disagree, it doesn't make it "Stupid" or "Idiotic"
[6:23] <Visiiri> Who would you be more impressed with?
[6:23] <Darkebrz> It's like how you see these news stories
[6:23] <LuciferZ> I am a better builder than most people.
[6:23] <Visiiri> (I don't think Stephen is a coder o.o)
[6:23] <Snake> I agree.
[6:23] <LG_Legacy> People appreciate work thats taken a while, give notch as a example.
[6:23] <LuciferZ> It is not because I use hacks
[6:23] <Naxza> Right. Have fun bickering endlessly, folks. I'm going to go play some L4D2.

[6:23] <LG_Legacy> Look how long Infdev took. or Indev for that matter.
[6:23] <Zaneo> At a certain point the effort to reward ratio makes hacks look a little better...

[6:23] <Naxza> You may want to find some more enjoyable way to spend your evening.
[6:23] <LuciferZ> It's because I am simply better at planning and better at making things pretty

[6:23] <LG_Legacy> Hell see how much Multiplayer Survival is going? In the end, it's already bursting with anxiety.
[6:23] <Wervyn> The person who spent two hours is clearly making better use of their time.
[6:24] <outsomnia> Being impressed by people spending more time because they didn't use hacks to spend less time on it to place virtual blocks, oh joy!
[6:24] <Darkebrz> Wervyn, so?
[6:24] <Zaneo> I'm only talking about creative mode hacks, i refuse to use them in in(f)dev
[6:24] <LuciferZ> Having a handicap doesn't make things better
[6:24] <Darkebrz> The person who took 2 weeks had a lot more dedication
[6:24] <LuciferZ> It makes the person with the handicap more amazing maybe
[6:24] <Darkebrz> LuciferZ, but it does make them more impressive
[6:24] <Dommys> Wervyn If they both did it without hacks/with hacks SURE. but not when one person had an advantage over the other
[6:24] <LG_Legacy> Hacks in Infdev, we can all understand.
[6:24] <LuciferZ> It doesn't show in the work
[6:24] <Visiiri> Imagine building as going over a hill.
[6:24] <LG_Legacy> Because thats the time of innocence, people will first start to play it how it's suppose to be.
[6:24] <Visiiri> If you can fly, it isn't an acomplishment.
[6:24] <Wervyn> Dommys: The other person had access to the same advantage and refused to use it out of misguided principle.
[6:24] <Darkebrz> Jesus this chat is going way to fast.
[6:24] <LG_Legacy> Flying while survivng? No thanks mate.
[6:24] <Wervyn> That just makes him an idiot.
[6:24] <Trapiki> infdev would suck with hacks'

[6:25] <Snake> We all know that mp survival should not have hacks involved
[6:25] <Cial> i think that the "hacks" are ok in creative
[6:25] <Wervyn> A bit. But this is what I think about it.
[6:25] <Snake> No need to talk about that
[6:25] <Dommys> Darkebrz just restating.
[6:25] <Cial> but not in the other game modes
[6:25] <Wervyn> You can't just go calling someone a troll because they disagree with you.
[6:25] <Snake> A sandbox game has almost no limits
[6:25] <Zaneo> Dude i want you to look at some stuff people have done with hacks and tell me that it sucks.. just because they used hacks....
[6:25] <outsomnia> It shouldn't, but we all know someone's going to find a way to have them in multiplayer survival.
[6:25] <Visiiri> Wervyn: He's calling you a troll because you effectively called him an idiot.
[6:25] <chariot> are you saying that notch taking awhile to program something is similar to taking awhile to build something?
[6:25] <Dommys> I'm calling you a troll because you can't argue properly, instead your resort to personal attacks.
[6:25] <Zaneo> That is just ridiculous they may have put the same effort as other people
[6:25] <Wervyn> That I did!
[6:25] <Cial> can i call you all idots for beating this dead horse again and agian?
[6:25] <Dommys> You*
[6:25] <Zaneo> depending on the calse
[6:25] <Zaneo> scale*
[6:25] <Dommys> Enjoy being a troll.
[6:25] <Visiiri> chariot: He could use Game Maker and nobody would care?
[6:26] <Visiiri> Hhaheh
[6:26] <Darkebrz> Look, I understand why people use hacks. They like the freedom it gives them and the advantage it has in fast building. I chose not to use them though, because it makes the game to easy for me, there is no longer any challenge in building a massive tower or an apartment complex.

[6:26] <Visiiri> And, besides.
[6:26] <Wervyn> Dommys: Is calling someone a troll a personal attack?
[6:26] <Visiiri> This is simple idiocy.
[6:26] <LuciferZ> I'll give op to those who don't troll.
[6:26] <Darkebrz> Wervyn, you can't just go flaming someone because they disagree with you.
[6:26] <Dommys> No.
[6:26] <LG_Legacy> Alright alright everyone, get your dicks in your hands and go to #hacks, this is going a little bit far don't you think?
[6:26] <Cial> outsomnia, for doing this same argument time after time again
[6:26] <Snake> Is here supposed to be a challenge in a sandbox building game?
[6:26] <Snake> There*
[6:26] <Visiiri> Mmm, dicks.
[6:26] <Darkebrz> Snake, I think there is
[6:26] <Visiiri> I'll hold yours.
[6:26] <chariot> Visiiri, it's a retarded comparison. Programming a quality game takes time, no shit. A quality build in minecraft doesn't have anything to do with how long it takes.

[6:27] <outsomnia> @Cial, the arguement of whether you should respect people who use hacks or not?
[6:27] <Darkebrz> Snake, is Notch wanted hacks in his game, flying would have been in from day one
[6:27] <Visiiri> chariot: notice me laughing afterwards, or were you quick to respond?
[6:27] <LG_Legacy> Sigh
[6:27] <Snake> No shit

[6:27] <PuyoDead> Who cares about "repsect", it simply takes less effort. That's all.
[6:27] <Zaneo> Does it really matter in creative?

[6:28] <chariot> Visiiri, in #minecraft, its hard to tell if people are joking or are just being stupid
[6:28] <outsomnia> @PuyoDead , which is why I'm asking as to what arguement he's referring to exactly :S

[6:28] <Darkebrz> Okay

[7:00] <Cial> restore a backup from before the indected exes?
[7:02] <Zaneo> don't download infecte.... oh wait to late?
[7:02] <Morkraw> clean reboot (disable all non-windows services, all startup programs etc) and see if you can do anythjing then
[7:03] <Zaneo> you mean like safe mode?
[7:03] <Morkraw> nope
[7:03] <Zaneo> after going into msconfig and disabling everything?
[7:03] <Morkraw> i mean start -> run -> msconfig and turn off EVERYTHING in the last 2 tabs
[7:03] <Zaneo> heh
[7:03] <Morkraw> checking the "hide microsoft services" button first
[7:03] <Morkraw> and then rebooting
[7:04] <Zaneo> like as in what i said right after xD
[7:04] <Morkraw> well you said safe mode and thats not what i meant :<
[7:04] <Zaneo> mixing the two wouldn't be bad either
[7:05] <Morkraw> what OS are you using?
[7:05] <Morkraw> XP vista 7?
[7:06] <Visiiri> Vista
[7:06] <Visiiri> I just want to remove these two executables...
[7:06] <Morkraw> ok

[7:06] <Morkraw> well Visiiri if its not letting you its because you have a program running that is preventing you doing it
[7:07] <Morkraw> if you kill all programs, they cant stop you removing i
[7:07] <Visiiri> What sort of programs would that be?
[7:07] <Morkraw> well
[7:07] <Morkraw> all of them
[7:07] <Morkraw> thats the point
[7:07] <Visiiri> Hrm
[7:07] <Cial> windows
[7:07] <Morkraw> its a temporary reboot to disable everything other than core windows
[7:07] <Morkraw> and then you turn your stuff back on after rebooting
[7:07] <Visiiri> How about I just move them to a disk?

[7:45] <Dommys> You can watch it free online
[7:45] <Christoph> I DO appreciate the darker, more surreal tone that cartoons are taking lately.
[7:45] <Zaneo> Nah i know it's terrible i was just trying to prove your point
[7:46] <Christoph> For instance, channel frederator's Adventure Time is pretty righteous in my book.
[7:47] <Cial> cartoons are getting fucking retarded
[7:47] <Christoph> Pontificate.
[7:47] <Dommys> I've only seen one episode of Adventure Time, on Cartoon Network, and it was decent.
[7:47] <Dommys> Flapjack , Chowder

[7:52] <MarkTraceur> TkTech: So maybe try doubling it? D'you know how to do that on Linux?
[7:52] <TkTech> Shoot, no :|
[7:52] <TkTech> Google should know :)
[7:53] <TkTech> its a command line flag if you invoke it directly
[7:53] <TkTech> for system defaults, I don't know how to set those under linux
[7:53] <Dommys> I Like Phinneas and Ferb
[7:53] <Dommys> But really Cial, I don't see how you could possibly miss the awesome in Chowder/Flapjack
[7:53] <Zaneo> That show was jokes Dommy
[7:53] <Dommys> Especially Flapjack
[7:54] <Dommys> I've seen a few episodes of that show that really shocked me. lol
[7:54] <Cial> they have no plot crappy humor
[7:54] <Cial> horrible art
[7:55] <Dommys> You noted Phinneas and Ferb as one of your choices.. That show doesn't exactly display a great sense of art.
[7:55] <wry> like prison tattoos?
[7:55] <Dommys> It is definately a different style, though
[7:55] <Christoph> It has a very specific art style.

[8:33] <Jeffrey5383> i havent tried forwarding them yet.
[8:33] <Jeffrey5383> ill try it now
[8:33] <Dysgalt> Well thats your problem :)
[8:34] <Dysgalt> Remember 25565 TCP/UDP
[8:34] <Dysgalt> And the i.p Adress should be your routers(Thats what I did)
[8:35] <Jeffrey5383> ok ill try that. thanks
[8:36] <Dysgalt> Just do it from your router page
[8:36] <Dysgalt> None of that forwarding software
[8:36] <PuyoDead> Gotta admit, Gang Garrison 2 is pretty fun.
[8:36] <Jeffrey5383> i did. im setting it up now to see if it works

[9:09] <TrueWolves> set to private
[9:09] <Azathoth> there aren't really any ways to actually give/revoke build permissions

[9:09] <KodaichiZero> yep

[9:18] <TrueWolves> yeah
[9:18] <FakeSky> Or just let the blocks do the breaking animation when zombies are near, so you'll really need to kill zombies to be able to keep your fort safe.
[9:18] <TrueWolves> if they could break walls at half he speed you can in the game with your fists (ones with weapons could use weapons)
[9:18] <TrueWolves> Why half?
[9:19] <TrueWolves> becuase likely the zombies will outnumber you
[9:19] <Azathoth> they'd have to be able to combine their attacks on the blocks
[9:19] <Azathoth> to speed up the process
[9:19] * Dog is now known as MarkTraceur
[9:19] <TrueWolves> yeah
[9:19] <TrueWolves> They should be able to combine their attacking

[9:20] <FakeSky> "Hey, let's look at this wall ove- OH GOD IT'S A ZOMBIE"

[9:20] <MarkTraceur> Hey, does anyone here know how to add more memory to the Java plugin?
[9:20] <Azathoth> patch weak spots with iron
[9:20] <Spartacus> 4block thick walls.
[9:20] <Azathoth> although thick walls like that could get dangerous
[9:20] <Azathoth> because then the zombies would start tunneling inside
[9:20] <Azathoth> and you wouldn't be able to touch them

[9:21] <Azathoth> or i guess you would if you built walls only 2 blocks high
[9:21] <vede> Yeah. Once they get through one or two blocks, they may as well already be all the way through, because you can't stop them.
[9:21] <Spartacus> They're ZOMBIES, would they be coded to think of tunneling under a wall, who's width they're not sure of?
[9:21] <vede> Or you could add castle-style windows all over.
[9:21] <Firetempest> when they tunnel, its time to use the lever and raise the drawbridge on the lava moat
[9:21] <vede> Spartacus, they'd think (or not think) about going THROUGH the wall.
[9:21] <vede> That's what we're talking about.
[9:21] <Azathoth> yeah, i'm not sure how their ai would work
[9:21] <Spartacus> Exactly
[9:22] * Eagle (Eagle@c-24-56-216-207.customer.broadstripe.net) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[9:22] <vede> Spartacus, they'll never think of tunneling UNDER a wall.

[9:22] <vede> We're talking about them breaking THROUGH walls.
[9:22] <Spartacus> [22:20] <Azathoth> because then the zombies would start tunneling inside
[9:22] <Azathoth> but vede, how do they know the difference between a wall and a cliff or something?
[9:22] <vede> Yeah.
[9:22] <vede> Inside the wall.
[9:23] * Eagle (Eagle@c-24-56-216-207.customer.broadstripe.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:23] <vede> He meant tunneling through walls.
[9:23] <Spartacus> |:L
[9:23] <vede> Not tunneling UNDER them.
[9:23] <Spartacus> And I'm going to "retreat" from a base.
[9:23] <Azathoth> i guess it wouldn't be too hard to just do a quick check to see how many blocks are in front of them
[9:23] * ClassiestMedic (Kevjohnson@pool-141-154-114-178.bstnma.btas.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:24] <vede> So they don't go trying to tunnel through mountains, yeah?
[9:24] <Spartacus> You're going to also have to keep in mind they can't just telepathically scan the area for where the players are.
[9:24] <vede> Spartacus, not telepathically.
[9:24] <vede> ... Aromatically?
[9:24] <Spartacus> ...
[9:24] <vede> :P
[9:24] <Azathoth> so their pathfinding would just have to allow them to draw a path through a certain number of blocks
[9:25] <Spartacus> They're going to have to see the player or their fucking torches to know they're there to know there to break through to.

[9:25] <Azathoth> or just give different kinds of blocks appropriate path weights. i'm assuming he's using a* or dijkstra's or something
[9:26] <Azathoth> spartacus, he could just let them detect you in a certain proximity (based on scent or something :P)
[9:26] <Azathoth> but it wouldn't be too hard to just trace a ray to see if the player is visible
[9:26] <TrueWolves> could have them auto detect you with in 10 squars, and by sight at 30
[9:26] <Spartacus> *sound
[9:26] <TrueWolves> Azathoth, line of sight calculations for a computer can be more cpu heavy then they sound.
[9:26] <Azathoth> it would be totally creepy if zombies could detect you without line of sight
[9:27] <Spartacus> Do remember, you have different footstep noises on different blocks.
[9:27] <Azathoth> true, truewolves
[9:27] <Azathoth> i guess that's why they call you truewolves
[9:27] <TrueWolves> ... it's not. XD
[9:27] <Azathoth> but it wouldn't have to be done every frame
[9:27] <TrueWolves> True
[9:27] <LuciferZ> Wolves
[9:28] <Azathoth> :D
[9:28] * TrueWolves 's name was found 6 years ago in an atempt to get a unique number-free name for Runescape, he then figured this one out, and it happened to be free on the whole internet, and so now it's his name on it.
[9:28] <Azathoth> number-free?
[9:28] <TrueWolves> My real name is not so unique.

[9:29] <TrueWolves> My memory sucked 6 years ago
[9:29] <AndrewPH> I just watched the film
[9:29] <TrueWolves> I wouldn't be able to remember a number

[9:51] <Shadaez> what do you mean "not work"
[9:52] <MarkTraceur> The screen goes completely black a few seconds after I load the world
[9:52] * TerribleTrioJoe (TerribleTr@JZISCHKA.RES.CMU.EDU) has joined #minecraft
[9:52] <Shadaez> All versions?
[9:52] <MarkTraceur> No, just infdev

[9:53] <MarkTraceur> TkTech: Didn't you say it might be a memory issue?
[9:54] <TkTech> MarkTraceur: Indeed, it usually is
[9:54] <Shadaez> might just be a bug that notch knows about
[9:54] <LuciferZ> MarkTraceur, use task manager to end all java processes
[9:54] <LuciferZ> Then try again
[9:54] <TkTech> MarkTraceur: Notch commented on it in his blog about 5 weeks ago
[9:54] <MarkTraceur> LuciferZ: Linux
[9:54] <LuciferZ> Oh fuck that bro
[9:54] <MarkTraceur> TkTech: How would you fix it on Windows?
[9:54] <LuciferZ> You're alone
[9:54] <TkTech> MarkTraceur: The applet would load, then as it finished generating terrain it would go black
[9:55] <TkTech> MarkTraceur: Dunno xD Under OS X its just Applications -> Java Settings -> <version> -> Options -> Memory
[9:55] <TerribleTrioJoe> you trying to increase the java memory?

[9:56] <MarkTraceur> Hrm
[9:56] <TerribleTrioJoe> let me look it up
[9:57] * godhand1942 (godhand194@028mgmt-tl15.campus.mcgill.ca) has joined #minecraft
[9:58] <TerribleTrioJoe> you are using linux?
[9:58] <vede> MarkTraceur, you might try what LuciferZ said. Open a terminal and do "killall -9 java" then try.
[9:59] <MarkTraceur> *shrug* I've stopped and started the applet too many times to count
[9:59] <vede> MarkTraceur, but there might be some other java processes going for some reason.
[9:59] <MarkTraceur> But let's try again I guess
[9:59] <MarkTraceur> Well, I just ps ax | grep java and find only one
[10:00] <vede> Hm.
[10:00] <vede> MarkTraceur, is your Java up to date?
[10:00] <vede> What distribution are you using?
[10:00] <MarkTraceur> Ubuntu, and I updated to 10.04
[10:01] <MarkTraceur> Let me run update-manager
[10:01] <MarkTraceur> Yeah, nothing important
[10:01] <vede> Yeah, Ubuntu's default Java setup is fucktarded.
[10:01] <MarkTraceur> It got worse when I updated....the Sun plugin is no longer installable
[10:01] * Firetempest is tired of making cortex sprites
[10:02] <vede> MarkTraceur, if you like Ubuntu, but want things to actually work consistently, you should get Linux Mint.
[10:02] <TerribleTrioJoe> ok MarkTraceur, can you open the java control panel?
[10:02] <TerribleTrioJoe> Linux mint is very nice ;)
[10:02] <vede> It's Ubuntu without all the suckage.
[10:02] <MarkTraceur> TerribleTrioJoe: I'm not sure where it is ><
[10:02] <TerribleTrioJoe> ok, open your applications menu
[10:02] <MarkTraceur> Yes, I've used Mint before

[10:03] <TerribleTrioJoe> see if you can find something called Sun Java 6 control panel
[10:03] <TerribleTrioJoe> I'm using Mint right now, not really familiar with the ubuntu menu system
[10:04] <MarkTraceur> No....remember, Sun's plugin isn't installable
[10:04] <MarkTraceur> I'm using IcedTea

[10:05] <TerribleTrioJoe> vede: do you use Mint?
[10:05] <vede> Yes.

[10:07] <TerribleTrioJoe> do you have a windows partition on your machine?

[10:09] <TerribleTrioJoe> alright, is there a Java tab?

[10:11] <MarkTraceur> Hrm....
[10:11] <vede> Will that even be necessary now that he has Sun Java?
[10:11] <MarkTraceur> I set it to 1000, actually, because it crashed even with 300
[10:11] <MarkTraceur> But it doesn't show the extra memory
[10:12] <vede> MarkTraceur, you should probably make sure that Firefox is set to use the correct Java.

[10:13] <TerribleTrioJoe> also, suggestion: in the java control Panel, go to advanced, in the settings > java console menu, choose 'show java console'
[10:13] <TerribleTrioJoe> that might help you to see what's going wrong
[10:14] <DrayneO> is there really a good guide anywhere for using.configuring everything in MCSharp?
[10:15] <vede> Drayne0, go to MCSharp's channel for that. You can't get support for custom servers or clients here.
[10:15] <MarkTraceur> java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1
[10:15] <MarkTraceur> at net.minecraft.a.a.g.i(Unknown Source)

[10:15] <MarkTraceur> at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
[10:15] <MarkTraceur> Not terribly helpful
[10:16] <TerribleTrioJoe> ArrayIndexOutOfBounds doesn't seem like a memory error ...
[10:16] <MarkTraceur> Also, new development, I am now spawning in progressively deeper places in a mountain
[10:16] <DrayneO> im not looking for support rather than a guide to all the different things you can do
[10:17] <DrayneO> i already have to server up and running, and prot forwarding works, i already got 2 guys in my server randomly and successfully
[10:17] <DrayneO> things like specifying who can build on/goto whichever levels
[10:17] <vede> Drayne0, that's support.
[10:17] <DrayneO> aaaa fine :x
[10:17] <vede> If you want any help at all regarding custom servers, go the channel for that server.
[10:18] <MarkTraceur> Maybe I should just install Mint, and see how that goes
[10:18] <vede> Yes, you should.
[10:18] <TerribleTrioJoe> oh, just remembered. is sound not working on windows a known issue?
[10:18] <MarkTraceur> I guess the rest of my night will be spent on that
[10:18] <TerribleTrioJoe> (for minecraft)
[10:18] <vede> It has Sun Java and Flash and proprietary codecs and all those neet feetchurs all preinstalled.
[10:19] <vede> So you can install and then start playing Minecraft and all your music out of the box. Kickass.
[10:19] <vede> Now Imma go watch Bones.

[10:51] <vurtual> But still, it's like it just came out recently.
[10:51] <Azathoth> so i have the frequency and speed of a wave... how can i find its wavelength again?

[10:58] <vurtual> Except the whole low resolution thing
[10:58] <Azathoth> it's not up to par with modern computers, but it's still not bad for being so old
[10:58] <Azathoth> yeah
[10:58] <Azathoth> can't wait to see what comes out next
[10:58] <vurtual> probably something not much better
[10:58] <Shadae> it's going to be amazingly better imo
[10:58] <vurtual> At least nintendo has the excuse of gameplay-over-graphics, and their really awesome use of graphics in games.

[11:10] <DrayneO> im not going to ask

[11:11] <vurtual> DrayneO we were talking about console weight
[11:11] <DrayneO> i accidentally left the server and rejoined
[11:11] <vurtual> and now I'm picking what n64 game to play
[11:11] <DrayneO> so i got it haha
[11:11] <vurtual> and now there's a spider on my favorite n64 control
[11:11] <Azathoth> yeah. he left like 5 seconds before
[11:11] <DrayneO> would somebody be able to confirm weather or not omen works on windows 7?
[11:11] <vurtual> also I turn to grab some weapon to despider my controls, and bam, I find my old lego pistol
[11:12] <Azathoth> whether
[11:12] <DrayneO> it crashes for me when i try to create maps =\
[11:12] <Azathoth> we're not really supposed to talk about that here
[11:12] <Azathoth> i wouldn't know anyway
[11:12] <DrayneO> i suck at spelling/english leave me alone :x
[11:12] <vurtual> Azathoth, omen is fine.
[11:12] <vurtual> so are things like backup scripts
[11:12] <Azathoth> oh yeah
[11:12] <vurtual> there's no other decent N64 controller for me to use
[11:13] <Azathoth> omen is just a map editor?
[11:13] <DrayneO> yeah
[11:13] <DrayneO> it just crashes when i try to save/edit a map
[11:14] <DrayneO> im just trying to create a blank 200x200x500 map D:
[11:14] <vurtual> Okay, I can't find any usable N64 controllers.
[11:15] <vurtual> oh hey, straight from sterile storage, blue controller.
[11:15] <DrayneO> would somebody be willing to maybe make a 200x200x500 map and send it to me? :V

[12:28] <Malikat> SHOOT.
[12:28] <Marach-14> "guys."
[12:28] * Kald opens fire.
[12:28] <Kald> Anyway.
[12:29] <Kald> Do trees have "growth stages"? Because right now, the trees I planted vary from great, majestic, tall motherfuckers and...THINGS that look like some kind oversized shrub (not a sapling).
[12:29] <vurtual> Winning a race is REALLY hard to do without an accelleration stat
[12:29] <Malikat> they don't have stages as far as i know
[12:29] <Malikat> they just erupt fully grown from a sapling
[12:29] <Kald> So it's random, then. Good to know.
[12:31] <vurtual> He is betting heavily on sebulba
[12:31] <Marach-14> i stopped wondering what the hell is vurtual playing.
[12:32] <vurtual> Star Wars: Episode I Racer, duh
[12:32] <Malikat> oh my god seriously?
[12:32] <Marach-14> ha. play big race usa
[12:32] <Malikat> i love that game

[12:32] <vurtual> Yes.
[12:32] <Malikat> episode 1 racer = <3
[12:32] <vurtual> I'm stuck in a problem. My accel stat is, in my game, really really low
[12:32] <vurtual> I also have 2 money'
[12:32] <Malikat> stop crashing
[12:33] <Malikat> do some easy races so you can afford to repair your current stuff
[12:33] <vurtual> so I downgraded my top speed(a bad idea, I think), and my cooling(not that wonderful of a function, even though ironically these are what I use to not be so slow)
[12:33] <Malikat> cause when stuff is damaged it doesn't work full
[12:33] <vurtual> and last I checked, redoing a race you first placed does not give you moneys
[12:33] <Malikat> i'm pretty sure there is a way to get moneys from old races
[12:33] <Malikat> i can't remember how
[12:33] <Malikat> but i'm pretty sure
[12:33] <Marach-14> moneys?

[13:16] <T> So I've been thinking about something crazy.
[13:16] <T> I see a lot of discussion about griefing in Multiplayer, right?
[13:16] <vurtual> That surround sound speakers apparently are supposed to be quiet?
[13:16] <vurtual> now I'm playing super mario sunshine again, even though I have an old save.
[13:16] * sppt (i@ip545125db.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft
[13:16] <T> Actually, the idea isn't so much about griefing.
[13:17] <T> But more like, what if there were some discrete menace that players had to band together to fight.
[13:17] <Marach-14> monsters?
[13:17] <T> Yeah, right now Creepers do that, but I'm thinking something that happens less often but demands everyone's attention.
[13:17] <T> Like spores that fall from the sky and destroy what they land on.
[13:18] <Shadae> natural disasters
[13:18] <T> Basically, yeah.
[13:18] <T> But a disaster you can work together against.
[13:18] <Marach-14> what you can do against spores?
[13:18] <T> Ride dragons :V
[13:18] <vurtual> fans
[13:19] <T> THe idea came to me while reading Dragonriders of pern, but it doesn't have to be spores and dragons.
[13:19] <T> My point is just, have some other sort of "endgame" besides assuming players will band together and maybe have territorial disputes.
[13:19] <T> Wurm makes players fight over artifacts.
[13:19] <T> And that's cool but there's no shortage of games featuring wars.
[13:19] <Marach-14> survival is about surviving, not arguing
[13:20] <Marach-14> players work together
[13:20] <T> Right.
[13:20] <Marach-14> but we'll see about that :D
[13:20] <T> But are creepers and skeletons really going to be a big enough threat to make a town worry for their survival?
[13:20] <Marach-14> they can't destroy blocks yet
[13:21] <T> Or do we all have so much practice defending ourselves from them that they'll be only an annoyance?
[13:21] <T> In Infdev I have a house on top of a 30 block high rock pillar, connected to a nearby mountain by a thin bridge.
[13:22] <T> Even if creepers *tried* to blow up my house (instead of only if they see me) they wouldn't be able to.
[13:22] <Marach-14> infdev is jsut a tech demo
[13:22] <T> But you see my point.
[13:22] <Marach-14> it isn't even meant to be fully playable
[13:23] <T> It'd be neat to have a more focused, powerful force for players to band together against.
[13:23] <T> And it'd be even cooler if it weren't "evil invaders" like every other game ever.
[13:23] <T> Or so my crazy thought goes.

[14:03] <liq3> Sonic The Hedgehog on Sega was hard as shit.

[15:06] <Shori> ..winzip is older than winrar
[15:06] <Cintiq> winrar / 7zip
[15:06] <Shori> ..?__?
[15:06] <Jat> so whats wrong with winrar?
[15:06] <Cintiq> winzip is bloody awful
[15:06] <Snowman> It's looks
[15:06] <Snowman> Compression isn't as good
[15:06] <Cintiq> just use 7zip
[15:06] <Snowman> 7zip is best
[15:06] <Cintiq> Snowman: Seriously?
[15:07] <Cintiq> You take looks into account
[15:07] <Snowman> Yup
[15:07] <Cintiq> :|
[15:07] <T> Wikipedia says 7z is better except for certain files where RAR has special techniques that compress better.
[15:07] <Cintiq> it's... oh lawd.
[15:07] <T> Like wavs and bmps.
[15:07] <Shori> Am I a bad person for not going with a lighter media player, due to certain features of winamp, Cintiq? :P
[15:07] <Jat> i consider any program a piece of shit if it tells me it CHOOSES NOT TO open a zip file just because it considers it incorrectly created
[15:07] <Jat> which 7zip has done
[15:08] <Cintiq> Shori: Wat
[15:08] <Jat> then i went to winrar and it opened it just fine
[15:08] <Shori> I even went so far as to get it running perfectly in wine <_<
[15:08] <Cintiq> I use winamp.
[15:08] <Snowman> Shori, Winamp is the best media player

[15:09] <T> It seems like RAR is obviously better than ZIP, but we're so used to ZIP now that it sticks around.
[15:09] <Cintiq> winamp plays FLAC
[15:09] <Cintiq> good enough for me
[15:10] <Cintiq> it's like VLC over media player
[15:10] <Cintiq> mp is overrated

[15:10] <Jat> for most peopel the differences between rar and zip dont matter anyway
[15:10] <Cintiq> this is 320 kb/s

[15:10] <Jat> japan likes to a zip format called lzh
[15:10] <Shadae> are you a waffles.fm member?
[15:11] <Cintiq> that's because .zip is awful
[15:11] <Cintiq> and no-one uses it
[15:11] <Cintiq> but .7z isn't popular enough to be used commonly
[15:11] <Jat> i mean compression format
[15:11] <Cintiq> hence why .rar reigns supreme
[15:11] <T> I still see zips all the time.
[15:11] <vurtual> .yz is ftw
[15:11] <vurtual> er, .7z
[15:11] <Jat> or lzm or something
[15:11] <T> I see zip and rar about equally.
[15:11] <Marach-14> Jat: isn't it like amiga format?
[15:11] <Jat> i forget exactly
[15:11] <Cintiq> T: Then you're browsing the wrongggggg sites.
[15:11] <Alcobob> tar.gz ftw
[15:11] <Superwafflez> Couldnt the same compression be applied to the .zip file extension?
[15:11] <Jat> marach no
[15:11] <T> And I almost never see anything else.
[15:11] <vurtual> I only really see .zip and .7z
[15:11] <Marach-14> 7z is best
[15:11] <Cintiq> you guys serious?
[15:11] <Cintiq> i haven't seen a zip in years
[15:11] <Cat> 7z > all others
[15:11] <Jat> its just another compression format but i think it was created by a japanese guy
[15:11] <Jat> so japan uses it
[15:11] <Cintiq> 7z is boss
[15:11] <Alcobob> zip can't handle unicode
[15:11] <Cintiq> but not enough people use it
[15:12] <T> Cintiq, your tone is grating.
[15:12] <Cintiq> :3
[15:12] <Jat> if youre gonna say you like one compression format more than others explain why
[15:12] * Cat
[15:12] <T> I see zips because I download things like indie games where the audience might not be as technical.
[15:12] <Marach-14> yeah.
[15:12] <Cintiq> Jat: That directed at me?
[15:12] <Jat> anyway
[15:12] <Cintiq> already briefly did, if yes.
[15:12] <Jat> i mean anyone
[15:12] <Marach-14> Jat: 7z has best compression ratio and has all the features from zip and rar combines and much more.
[15:12] <Jat> it is directed at anyone
[15:12] <T> I imagine if I only downloaded things like pirated books, I might see more rars and 7zs.

[15:35] <Marach-14> last time i checked it opens 2 times longer
[15:35] <Snowman> Because your computer sucks
[15:35] <Cintiq> 20:43.40?????? Cintiq: i say, s'long as you're using chrome/ff/opera you're fine.

[15:36] <Marach-14> see, it shouldn't matter
[15:36] <Snowman> lol, Vista
[15:36] <Cintiq> unless you're using IE
[15:36] <Budda> its win7
[15:36] <Cintiq> then there's o problem
[15:36] <Codlike> Holy what? 10 tweets already?
[15:36] <Budda> moo: os: Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate - (6.1.7600)
[15:36] <Marach-14> Budda: congratulations. it's hard to make it not crash for that long
[15:36] <Cintiq> Snowman: Apparently vista is fine these days.
[15:36] <Cintiq> due to the 1001 bugfixes
[15:36] <Snowman> Yeah, but 7 is better
[15:36] <Cintiq> butstill
[15:36] <Cintiq> lolvista
[15:36] <Budda> its win7
[15:36] <Cintiq> xp/7 tbh
[15:36] <Cintiq> or linux
[15:37] <Snowman> Xp is old as fuck
[15:37] <Budda> just this script thinks win7 is vista
[15:37] <Snowman> XP is like 8 years old now
[15:37] <Cintiq> Snowman: and?
[15:37] <Cintiq> i recently upgraded from xp to 7
[15:37] <Snowman> Doesn't support DirectX 10
[15:37] <Cintiq> and i wouldn't mind being back on it
[15:37] <Budda> xp is balls
[15:37] <Snowman> It's 13:37
[15:37] <Cintiq> there are hacked versions of dx10 for it
[15:37] <Marach-14> xp is good
[15:37] <Cintiq> though they're awful
[15:37] <Cintiq> and don't work
[15:37] <Marach-14> and Snowman is right
[15:37] <Cintiq> not that it matters, though.
[15:37] <Budda> its 23:37
[15:37] <Marach-14> yeah.
[15:37] <Cintiq> nothing really uses dx10
[15:37] <Snowman> Budda, stop being Chinese
[15:37] <Budda> sif
[15:38] <Cintiq> lmao, what
[15:38] <Snowman> Cintiq, not true
[15:38] <Cintiq> needs it, then
[15:38] <Budda> Snowman: try a little more south
[15:38] <Snowman> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_with_DirectX_10_support
[15:38] <Cintiq> with support
[15:38] <Cintiq> not need
[15:38] <Snowman> Taiwan
[15:38] <Cintiq> though that's my fault
[15:38] <Budda> more
[15:38] <Marach-14> i don't need good graphics
[15:38] <Cintiq> yea
[15:38] <Cintiq> how many of those
[15:38] <Cintiq> require it
[15:38] <Cintiq> just cause 2 is all i know
[15:38] <Snowman> Anyway, xp uses wizards
[15:38] <Snowman> Which suck
[15:39] <Cintiq> wat
[15:39] <Marach-14> what?
[15:39] <Budda> i prefer magicians to wizards
[15:39] <Snowman> ...
[15:39] <Budda> or even warlocks
[15:40] <Snowman> Stuff like this: http://designlibrary.blinkinteractive.com/images/2007/11/08/xp_wizard.jpg
[15:40] <Marach-14> upgrading to 7 is not worth the effort
[15:40] <Cintiq> ninjas > wizards tbh
[15:40] <Budda> 7 is so worth it
[15:40] <Snowman> Windows 7 is cool and does everything itself
[15:40] <Cintiq> Budda: Not really
[15:40] <Marach-14> what USEFUL would i get?
[15:40] * zedDB (zed@78-69-30-229-no36.tbcn.telia.com) has joined #minecraft
[15:40] <Cintiq> i wouldn't mind if i was downgraded to xp
[15:40] <Snowman> Aero features
[15:40] <Cintiq> wouldn't bother me in the slightest
[15:40] <Cintiq> you can get aero for xp
[15:40] <Budda> the one thing that I LOVE in win7, it start button + type anything you want + enter
[15:41] <Cintiq> and again, functionality > aestetics
[15:41] <Cintiq> as i said earlier
[15:41] <Snowman> A WORKING search function
[15:41] <Marach-14> i don't need aero
[15:41] <Cintiq> Budda: There's an xp hack for that too :)
[15:41] <Marach-14> i don't need search
[15:41] <Snowman> XP's search has never workred for me
[15:41] <Budda> yes, see the key word being hack
[15:41] <Snowman> Libraries
[15:41] <Marach-14> i never used search in xp
[15:41] <Budda> hacks can break
[15:41] <Cintiq> xp's search was goddamn awful
[15:41] <Cintiq> but still
[15:41] <Marach-14> because my hd is NOT filled with junk
[15:41] <Cintiq> who actually searches anyway >_>
[15:41] <Budda> i do
[15:41] <Cintiq> yeah
[15:41] <Cintiq> i have
[15:41] <Budda> when i run anything
[15:41] <Cintiq> desktop>programs>installers
[15:41] <Marach-14> ...
[15:41] <Budda> start>type>enter
[15:41] <Cintiq> desktop>games
[15:42] <Cintiq> desktop>movies
[15:42] <Cintiq> etc
[15:42] <Cintiq> never lose anything.
[15:42] <Snowman> Windows 7 automatically installs drivers for everything you plug in there
[15:42] <Marach-14> me neither
[15:42] <Budda> games and movies i have HDDs for
[15:42] <Marach-14> Snowman: and xp doesn't?
[15:42] <Cintiq> Snowman: Yeah, that's nice, I'll admit.
[15:42] <Budda> but for programs, start>type>enter is win
[15:42] <Cintiq> my xp never did ;-;
[15:42] <Snowman> Xp doesn't
[15:42] <Speljohan__> if... you have new hardware Snowman
[15:42] <Marach-14> Budda: win+r
[15:42] <Speljohan__> on old hardware it doesn't
[15:42] <Budda> no
[15:42] <Marach-14> i don't have new hardware
[15:42] <Cintiq> Speljohan__: Software
[15:42] <Snowman> And Windows 7 is fast
[15:42] <Marach-14> it can't be faster than xp
[15:42] <Cintiq> no faster than xp
[15:42] <Speljohan__> here we go, win7 is proven to be slower than xp
[15:43] <Cintiq> infact probably slower
[15:43] <Budda> Marach-14: that means you have to know the exact spelling of the exe, with this you just type the program
[15:43] <Cintiq> due to the fancy visual bs
[15:43] <Speljohan__> which is not surprising
[15:43] <Budda> or part of it
[15:43] <Speljohan__> at all
[15:43] <Snowman> It has Aero shake! :3
[15:43] <Speljohan__> aero sux tho
[15:43] <Snowman> No, it's awesome
[15:43] <Speljohan__> a productive work environment should cut down on visual bullshit
[15:43] <Marach-14> Budda: i use it for firefox. my desktop is rarely visible
[15:43] <Budda> yeah, i love the window docking auto too
[15:43] <Cintiq> my most use feature of win7
[15:43] <Marach-14> i don't use a start menu either
[15:43] <Cintiq> is everything xp had
[15:43] <Cintiq> there's nothing great about it
[15:43] <Speljohan__> lol the docking rages me so hard Budda
[15:43] <Cintiq> it's just a pleasant upgrade to me
[15:43] <Snowman> It has good backwards compatibility
[15:44] <Budda> windows auto snapping to half screen/full screen is great
[15:44] <Cintiq> AND MY GOD
[15:44] <Speljohan__> lol
[15:44] * Cat (PyroPyro@109.93.3.164) Quit (Quit: Roger over and out, PyroPyro)
[15:44] <Cintiq> I KEEP FORGETTING TO DO SOMETHING
[15:44] <Cintiq> CONSTANTLY
[15:44] <Speljohan__> win7 backwards compatibility is 999x worse than xp
[15:44] <Marach-14> i won't pay for something i don't even need
[15:44] <Budda> no Speljohan__
[15:44] <Speljohan__> will always be that way
[15:44] <Speljohan__> windows xp mode doesn't count Budda
[15:44] <Budda> the compatability thing in program options actually works
[15:44] <Budda> as opposed to the winxp one
[15:44] <Snowman> It has jumplists, which are so much win
[15:44] <Speljohan__> because it's just a fucking image file of winxp
[15:44] <Budda> which never did shit
[15:44] <Marach-14> Budda: it always worked in xp
[15:44] <Budda> not for me
[15:44] <Speljohan__> wrong
[15:44] <Speljohan__> it didnt work in xp nor win7
[15:44] <Budda> whatever i tried to run in compat mode never worked
[15:44] <Speljohan__> cus it's a desperate shit solution
[15:45] <Budda> it does on this
[15:45] <Marach-14> a lot of programs started working in xp
[15:45] <Speljohan__> because microsoft are idiots
[15:45] <Speljohan__> and lazy
[15:45] <Marach-14> ie. Big Race USA
[15:45] <Marach-14> begins to work correctly in 98 mode
[15:45] <Cintiq> chrome doesn't even work on my comp
[15:45] <Budda> well, either way, i think win7>xp
[15:45] <Cintiq> mind you, the installer i had was from april 1 '09
[15:45] <Cintiq> :D
[15:45] <Budda> and im not going to be changing probably ever
[15:45] <Budda> so ye
[15:45] <Marach-14> convince me
[15:45] <Cintiq> sure you won't, Budda
[15:45] <Cintiq> bet you said that about xp at the time.
[15:45] <Budda> if i want speed, ill install linux
[15:45] <Speljohan__> either way, win7 is just a cheap marketing trick to make more money by forcing people who have vista to upgrade
[15:46] <Cintiq> even though xp is still brilliant
[15:46] <Snowman> LINUX IS STILL BEST
[15:46] <Budda> Cintiq: meaning i wont downgrade
[15:46] <Cintiq> linux is best.
[15:46] <Cintiq> but that's old news.
[15:46] <Budda> if theres something new that looks good, ill install it
[15:46] <Speljohan__> linux is not the best, far from it
[15:46] <Marach-14> linux is damn fast here
[15:46] <Snowman> Linux's only program is compatibility and user-friendlyness
[15:46] <Speljohan__> not for desktop market anyway
[15:46] <Marach-14> Snowman: second use fixed by ubuntu
[15:46] <Marach-14> one*
[15:46] <Speljohan__> despite what people say
[15:46] <Speljohan__> ps
[15:46] <Cintiq> i noticed no-one has mentioned mac, why not bring in all it's positives to the discussion?
[15:46] <Speljohan__> ubuntu is SHIT
[15:46] <Cintiq> LIKE RIGHT CLICK
[15:46] <Cintiq> HARRRRRRRRRRRRR
[15:46] <Speljohan__> you might as well fucking use windows
[15:46] <Snowman> Meh, Ubuntu wasn't that nice to me :/
[15:47] <Speljohan__> cus it's the same amount of bloat
[15:47] <Cintiq> fedora mengs
[15:47] <Marach-14> ubuntu is very good
[15:47] <Snowman> Kubuntu is better
[15:47] <Budda> mac is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad

[17:19] <Marach-14> it's a great tool
[17:19] <Marach-14> i just hate closing everything
[17:20] <Wervyn> It's a hobbled piece of crap, unless the version I have is old and there's a new version that adds things like a clipboard and 3D visualization and doesn't glitch all over the screen.

[17:21] <Marach-14> don't do that in omen
[17:21] <Marach-14> that's what is minecraft for
[17:22] <Shori> getting rid of lava/adding lava/etc for creative multiplayer
[17:22] <Marach-14> very simple
[17:22] <Marach-14> replace all 3d
[17:22] <Wervyn> Yes, I absolutely want to switch back and forth and save and reload every time I want to check if a change worked right.
[17:22] <Shori> wouldn't be possible to do a few of the projects that we've pulled off on one of the private servers without re-adding lava
[17:23] <Shori> Wervyn - Pretty simple, stop being bad at editing.
[17:23] <Marach-14> batch works are very simple if you know what to do
[17:23] <Marach-14> ie. moving all the blocks in a map
[17:23] <Wervyn> I'm not bad at editing. I can use the tool just fine, but it isn't wrong to point out that it's a very limited tool and could be much better.
[17:23] <Marach-14> Wervyn: you don't even need to close omen

[17:25] <Wervyn> Really, I'm curious.
[17:25] <Marach-14> export layer to png
[17:26] <Wervyn> And then edit the PNG? No one sees a problem with that?
[17:26] <Marach-14> like move layer up/down, but when you need bigger distance
[17:26] <Marach-14> Wervyn: edit? why
[17:26] <Marach-14> copypasting, not editing
[17:27] <Wervyn> Okay, like say I've built a structure like some column. And I'd like to take that column and copy it around a hall.
[17:27] <Wervyn> Show me how to do that.
[17:27] <Marach-14> that isn't possible if it's big
[17:27] <Wervyn> Exactly.
[17:27] * Roadcrosser (1305339@120.140.157.8) has joined #minecraft
[17:27] <Marach-14> why would you want to do that
[17:28] <T> It's possible but it's be a little annoying, you'd have to do it a cross section at a time.
[17:28] <T> it'd*
[17:28] <Wervyn> That's the basics of the basics of design work, and you can't do it in any of the minecraft level editors in a sane way.
[17:28] <Wervyn> You basically have to reconstruct each column by hand.
[17:28] <T> Go write a better voxel based editor though.
[17:28] <T> ...then*
[17:28] <Wervyn> Thinking about it.
[17:29] <Marach-14> nobody creates 3d editors because that's what minecraft is for
[17:29] <T> I know voxel editors exist actually, I wonder if any can export PNG cross sections.
[17:29] <Marach-14> i think there are custom servers that allow copypasting
[17:29] <Marach-14> cough
[17:29] <T> Minecraft is not a 3D editor, it's a game.
[17:29] * blaster (heliduels@78.149.14.36) has joined #minecraft
[17:29] <Wervyn> See, the 3D visualization isn't really the important aspect, so much as the ability to manipulate large structures in 3D.
[17:29] <blaster> My fort now has a population of 52
[17:30] <Wervyn> If I'm designing something and I make an alignment mistake, I can't just select a whole 3D region and move it over a couple spaces. I have to erase the entire thing and build it again.

[17:30] <Marach-14> 2d moving is simple in omen
[17:31] <Marach-14> but only with whole layers. that's why i build on empty maps
[17:31] <T> Well, on the other hand that's part of the appeal of Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress for me, Wervyn.
[17:31] <T> You have to think about how to build things such that the builders can get in and around the structure during construction.
[17:31] <Marach-14> flatgrass is a waste of space
[17:31] <blaster> Agreed
[17:31] <Marach-14> so are generated maps
[17:31] <blaster> Does anyone have a heightmap of antartica?
[17:32] <blaster> I think it would make a great map
[17:32] <Marach-14> lol
[17:32] <T> Does Omen do generation from heightmaps?
[17:32] <Marach-14> yes
[17:32] <blaster> It has ice shelfs (Flat) mid antartic mountains ect...
[17:32] <blaster> Everything a good map could want
[17:32] <T> neat. I haven't played around with it much.
[17:32] <Marach-14> i had
[17:32] <Marach-14> it's very confusing
[17:33] <blaster> I am training my troops up to elite

[17:34] <blaster> 2010 military does not function
[17:34] <blaster> At all
[17:34] <T> Hoped that would be fixed by now.
[17:34] <blaster> It took me an hour to get them to train
[17:34] <T> Haven't followed any updates since the first release.
[17:34] <blaster> and after I told them to stop they never did anything else for the rest of their life
[17:34] <blaster> Which I was forced to end
[17:35] <Shori> T - I'm going to kill people all the time if they try to invade my fortress in mp :|
[17:35] <Shori> the thing will be a death trap
[17:35] <blaster> My legandary rock crafter is awsome
[17:35] <blaster> makes 90% of my fortress wealth
[17:36] <blaster> the other 10% is from weapons/armor/statues
[17:37] <Speljohan__> so... who has settlers 7?
[17:37] <Speljohan__> i want sum epic mp games
[17:37] <T> They're up to 7 now?
[17:37] <Marach-14> lol, there are 7 already?
[17:37] <Speljohan__> yeah
[17:37] <T> Man, it seems like such a short time ago I was playing the demo of 3.
[17:37] <Speljohan__> 5 and 6 were shit
[17:37] <blaster> Why do they need to make so many
[17:37] <Marach-14> i hate such games
[17:37] <Speljohan__> but settlers 7 went back to the roots
[17:37] <blaster> Multiplayer dwarf fortress would be the best thing since minecraft

[17:38] <blaster> Ah right

[17:42] <Speljohan__> yeh
[17:42] <blaster> Looks like a terrible version of dwarf fortress, but without dwarfs
[17:42] <vurtual> settlers 7 has the ubisoft always-connect drm
[17:42] <blaster> and with graphics
[17:42] <vurtual> also wasn't there some game on steam
[17:42] <Speljohan__> it's the drm-faggotry that ruined it
[17:42] <vurtual> that was basically trying ot be df for money?
[17:42] <blaster> Its a simplified dwarf fortress

[17:43] <Jat> the way people compare it to other games
[17:43] <Speljohan__> i enjoy df
[17:43] <Speljohan__> but it's not an rts
[17:43] <Jat> as if it is the pinnacle of everything
[17:44] <Jat> also because the ui sucks
[17:44] <Speljohan__> not in the traditional sense anyways
[17:44] <Marach-14> ha, these days people see ascii and say "dwarf fortress"

[17:45] <blaster> just add a user interface to that and you have a full DF in theory

[17:54] <Darnest> I wrote a simple map converter for .dat, .fcm, and .lvl maps: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6651509/mcmapconverter.jar
[17:54] <Darnest> it might still have some bugs, I haven't done much testing
[17:54] <Marach-14> which is a modified q3
[17:54] <vurtual> quake
[17:54] <vurtual> not q3
[17:54] <Marach-14> nvm
[17:54] <vurtual> q3 came out a year later than half-life at least.
[17:55] <T> It's not like mods are some sort of "fake" game just because they don't use a custom built engine.
[17:55] <vurtual> and half-life is essentially just quake which is essentially an attempt at a 3D doom.
[17:55] <vurtual> and doom is basically wolfenstein
[17:55] <T> Arkham Asylum and Gears of Wear share an engine.
[17:55] <vurtual> so wolfenstein 3D=left 4 dead
[17:55] <Marach-14> l4d is better doom!
[17:55] <blaster> Oh fuck, now my mayor is imposing faggoted mandates
[17:55] <vurtual> the floor is lava
[17:55] <Speljohan__> using the same engine and writing a mod are two completely different things
[17:55] <vurtual> you touch, no mandates
[17:55] <vurtual> They both use unreal, T.
[17:56] <T> A mod can be anything from a small tweak to a total conversion including extensive engine rewrites.
[17:56] <Speljohan__> when you pay for the license for an engine, you generally don't get jack shit to work with
[17:56] <Darnest> T: but most are small tweaks
[17:56] <blaster> I am going to need a jail of ultimate happyness
[17:56] <blaster> Gona fill it with a stockpile of toys
[17:56] <vurtual> tooooys
[17:56] <T> "Most are small tweaks" doesn't prove the claim that Left 4 Dead is Wolfenstein 3D, for example.
[17:56] <vurtual> T
[17:56] <vurtual> It's a joke.
[17:57] <T> I know.
[17:57] <Speljohan__> that was a bad comparison tho T
[17:57] <Speljohan__> cus they are completely different engines
[17:57] <Speljohan__> lol
[17:57] <Speljohan__> hell, wolfenstein 3d isn't even real 3d
[17:57] <T> But it doesn't seem like everyone was clear on the idea that just because it's a mod doesn't mean it's pointless.
[17:57] <Speljohan__> it's just pseudo 3d
[17:57] <vurtual> doom is basically a better wolfenstein
[17:57] <mutilator> doesnt quite work Darnest

[17:59] <Speljohan__> yes Marach-14
[17:59] <Speljohan__> fps then...
[17:59] <Marach-14> lol, console fps
[17:59] <vurtual> in what is 16 years
[18:00] <Speljohan__> it was the gameplay that rocked Marach-14
[18:00] <Marach-14> only wii can be good for fps's
[18:00] <vurtual> blaster, one level was basically that
[18:00] <vurtual> a secret level made of lots of swastikas
[18:00] <Speljohan__> ps it was released for pc too Marach-14
[18:00] <Speljohan__> it's just that i had it on n64
[18:00] <T> Any console can be good for FPSs if you hook up a mouse and the game supports it :V
[18:00] <Speljohan__> lol
[18:00] <vurtual> Also consoley-shooters
[18:00] <vurtual> those work out
[18:00] <vurtual> not the PC-style ones though
[18:01] <T> Yeah, if you design with the clumsiness of the controls in mind they're alright.
[18:01] <Speljohan__> n64 had a nice fps control scheme
[18:01] <vurtual> consoley shooters: rainbow six(n64), goldeneye, and so on.
[18:01] <Speljohan__> ye
[18:01] <vurtual> and metroid prime
[18:01] <T> Not as fluid feeling if you're used to a mouse, but then neither does Simon Belmont feel agile compared to Mario.
[18:01] <Speljohan__> goldeneye, turok etc had same controls
[18:01] <Speljohan__> and were awesome
[18:01] <vurtual> then a special mention of metroid prime 3.

[18:02] <vurtual> Metroid prime getting a worse score
[18:02] <Speljohan__> yeah
[18:02] <vurtual> because the controls made it so easy
[18:03] <vurtual> because they were so good
[18:03] <Speljohan__> lol ye
[18:03] <Speljohan__> tho market needs moar hard games
[18:03] <Marach-14> Speljohan__: indie
[18:03] <Speljohan__> damn casuals ruining my market

[18:04] <vurtual> that was twiligth princess
[18:04] <Speljohan__> sux
[18:04] <Marach-14> and optional completion challenges
[18:04] <vurtual> that caused the biggest problem
[18:04] <Marach-14> that is nice
[18:04] <Speljohan__> gaming was best in nes/snes era
[18:04] <vurtual> no wait nvm I'm mixing up multiple stories

[18:04] <Speljohan__> buuut
[18:04] <Speljohan__> it would keep you going
[18:04] <T> Well, people tend to overestimate how much difficulty matters.
[18:04] <Marach-14> Speljohan__: it wouldn't

[20:03] <vurtual> we'll just have to colonize at night.
[20:03] <LuciferZ> I mean if we can build a space station that just floats around
[20:03] <Speljohan__> a little cancer never hurt anyone
[20:03] <Speljohan__> ye vurtual
[20:03] <Emphursis> maybe you should colonise the sun?
[20:04] <KodaichiZero> hey alls gangstas
[20:04] <Emphursis> on your own
[20:04] <LuciferZ> Wouldn't it be easier to build a station on something resembling grounf?
[20:04] <KodaichiZero> what be's up
[20:04] <Speljohan__> nah, i don't have enough money Emphursis
[20:04] <Speljohan__> i need to kidnap some rich guy first
[20:04] <Speljohan__> to build me it
[20:04] <Speljohan__> i'm sure if we all put ice in our pants the heat won't be that bad :)
[20:04] <Emphursis> shame, i could have laughed at the slight flare that appeared when you got incinerated :P
[20:06] <vurtual> Also we need to get NASA more money
[20:06] <vurtual> somehow

[20:07] <Emphursis> oh, oh, oh! me me me! i'll donate ?5, that should get me a ticket or two, right?
[20:07] <Speljohan__> it won't matter much tho
[20:07] <Speljohan__> first warp engine will exist before i die (probably)
[20:07] <Jat> not likely
[20:07] <vurtual> also, make a simulator game
[20:07] <vurtual> Like, some kind of space oregon trail
[20:07] <Speljohan__> i'll be 70-80 by the time it happens
[20:07] <Speljohan__> so ye :D
[20:08] <vurtual> jat, we're building things, right now, that can go immensely fast
[20:08] <Jat> but not warp drives
[20:08] <vurtual> we just can't actually use them
[20:08] <Speljohan__> clearly you have not watched enough star trek Jat
[20:08] <vurtual> If, and just if, we got the right stuff to work just right, we could go to the moon in minutes.
[20:08] <vurtual> and for the guy inside it'd be like, seconds.
[20:08] <Emphursis> i know what goes really fast, a cat when you stand on its tail. harness that power and we will be at Alpha Centuri in hours, not years!
[20:08] <Speljohan__> everyone knows the warp drive will be launched on the 15th of april 2061
[20:08] <Jat> and warp engine prototype or proof of concept may at some point be developed but it would likely take a long time for it to actually be put into use without some sort of stimulus like war
[20:09] <Speljohan__> nah Jat world peace comes before that
[20:09] <vurtual> the fact that if you can go faster than light, it may just be capible of going through objects?
[20:09] <vurtual> And then you could warp your soldiers onto the battlefield?
[20:09] <Speljohan__> it's those darned vulcans preventing us from doing space exploration :(
[20:09] <rbos> warp engines were pulled out of the ass of some writer in the 60s and as a plot device, and they're still about as likely.
[20:10] <Speljohan__> if it wasn't for "some writer" we wouldn't have automatic doors at malls
[20:10] <Speljohan__> take that!
[20:10] <rbos> it's annoying that of all the possibilities for FTL, "warp" drive is the one that caught the public imagination. :(
[20:10] <Jat> rbos

[20:10] <Emphursis> tbh, i think that wormholes are more likely than warp drivew

[20:10] <Jat> most people dont even know what a warp drive is, just that it goes really fast, so it doesnt really matter what the public is interested in because its just a name not a technology that they know about
[20:11] <Speljohan__> artificial wormholes

[20:12] <vurtual> they use deuterium and antideuterium mixed, controlled by a dilithium crystal in a warp core, which creates a massive amount of energy and other such things
[20:13] <Speljohan__> !
[20:13] <vurtual> Then lots of this is sent into warp coils, in the warp nacelles, to create a warp bubble. It's a universe in a universe, that can go as fast as you can push the coils.
[20:13] <vurtual> It's also exponential or something, so 9.9 is nowhere near as powerful as 9.99
[20:13] <Speljohan__> 9.9975
[20:13] <Speljohan__> !
[20:14] <vurtual> 10 is some kind of theoretical laws-o-physics breaking value
[20:14] <rbos> TNG-style warp drives go asymptotic at warp 10
[20:14] <Emphursis> in space though, the laws of physics dont often apply
[20:14] <rbos> they kinda do
[20:14] <Jat> lol wat
[20:14] <Speljohan__> special relativity
[20:14] <Speljohan__> !
[20:15] <rbos> unless you mean in star trek, where physics is at best a rough guideline
[20:15] <Speljohan__> there was some article not long ago
[20:15] <rbos> "tetryon particles will fix it!"
[20:15] <Speljohan__> that "warp drives" would not be usable
[20:15] <Speljohan__> simply because space has some kind of particles floating around
[20:15] <vurtual> Screw them
[20:15] <Speljohan__> that would destroy you under high speeds
[20:15] <vurtual> We'll make it work
[20:16] <rbos> spel: you mean, like, "hydrogen"?
[20:16] <Speljohan__> ofc we will!
[20:16] <vurtual> Speljohan__, here's the thing.
[20:16] <vurtual> You aren't touching anything
[20:16] <Speljohan__> nah it was sumthin else rbos
[20:16] <Speljohan__> cant remember what it was
[20:16] <vurtual> it's a huge amount of did not do the research whenever someone "debunks" the warp drive for publicity.
[20:16] <Speljohan__> of course
[20:16] <Emphursis> i kind find the link, but i remember reading something within the last few weeks which said that in space, the laws of physics are altered/dont apply
[20:16] <Speljohan__> no practical tests have been performed, fuck theory vurtual
[20:16] <Speljohan__> :D
[20:16] <vurtual> Emphursis, look down at your feet
[20:16] <vurtual> that floor
[20:17] <vurtual> It's in spaaace
[20:17] <vurtual> part of a huge ball of materials in space
[20:17] <vurtual> We're in space
[20:17] <rbos> ^
[20:17] <Emphursis> i know that, i meant out of our atmosphere
[20:17] <Speljohan__> suppose the laws of physics do not apply outside our atmosphere
[20:17] <Speljohan__> that would mean the theory is debunked
[20:18] <rbos> wow
[20:18] <Speljohan__> which means eggheads need to find a new solution
[20:18] <Speljohan__> !
[20:18] <Emphursis> take perpetual moition. if you get a newtons cradle and set it adrift in space, then set it off, it would never stop as far as i can tell. there is no sound or heat produced
[20:18] <rbos> that's quite possibly the most staggeringly stupid thing I've seen in years
[20:18] <vurtual> so how do we spin around the sun, Emphursis?
[20:18] <vurtual> Black holes?
[20:18] <vurtual> Gravity in space?
[20:18] <Emphursis> gravity
[20:18] <vurtual> Light?

[20:18] <vurtual> It's funnier that way.
[20:18] <Speljohan__> !
[20:19] <Speljohan__> anyways, now we need a scapegoat for why we don't have long-term habitable spacecrafts yet

[20:20] <Emphursis> picachu, i choose you!

[20:20] <Speljohan__> :(
[20:20] <vurtual> AND NOT MAKING LOTS OF MONEY SO THAT YOU CAN GIVE NASA MONEY
[20:20] <rbos> Emphursis: assuming you're serious, even a "perpetual" motion device set up in a vacuum will eventually stop due to proton decay :)
[20:20] <vurtual> and not coming up with cheap ways of space travel
[20:20] <vurtual> rbos what about a super-vacuum
[20:20] <vurtual> where it has nothing to hit it.
[20:20] <rbos> oh! Right, those!
[20:20] <rbos> super-vacuums are pretty crazy
[20:20] <vurtual> no light or energy that makes any kind of friction
[20:20] <Emphursis> its still pretty close to perpetual though if it only stops after billions of years
[20:20] <vurtual> which is theoretically actually capible of existing.
[20:21] <rbos> the second law of thermodynamics doesn't apply in SUPER vacuums
[20:22] <Speljohan__> ur face doesn't apply in super vacuums
[20:22] <vurtual> if his face is the second law of thermodynamics
[20:22] <vurtual> then his mother is relativity.
[20:22] <Speljohan__> ^
[20:23] <vurtual> And moreso, an easily-used example of it.
[20:23] <Speljohan__> so we test the theory
[20:23] <rbos> special or general?
[20:23] <Speljohan__> let's send his face to a super vacuum
[20:23] <vurtual> all of it
[20:23] <Speljohan__> <vurtual> all of it

[20:40] <rbos> use a hoe on grass to get seeds

[20:40] <rbos> .. "use a hoe on grass" sounds dirty
[20:41] <Emphursis> i'm using a hoe on grass, but all i am getting is dirt
[20:41] <rbos> keep going
[20:41] <vurtual> So I decide, in order to best improve my mood, I should blast some music.
[20:41] <rbos> what I do is keep a large cleared field of grass beside my farming field, and harvest it regularly to get seeds
[20:41] <vurtual> I barely even turn up the sound a bit and my ear starts ringing.
[20:41] <vurtual> :|
[20:42] <rbos> if you go down it in stripes, then the grass grows back fast
[20:43] <rbos> how do you guys do wheat fields in minecraft? Usually I do a long canal of water, then field 4 blocks to each side, then road, then another 4 blocks, then water, then 4 blocks, then road, and so on
[20:43] <Emphursis> oh, now i feel stupid, i was left clicking, not right *facepalm*
[20:43] <vurtual> hurph
[20:44] <rbos> in infdev you have to build fields on top of lakes to get water working right :/

[21:15] <Mithril> mIRC cried every day for me
[21:15] <Marach-14> vurtual: i want to run it and irc. i want no nag screens
[21:15] <LuciferZ> Jesus you are despicably lazy
[21:16] <LuciferZ> And I just failed an exam I was too lazy to study for
[21:16] <LuciferZ> This is a serious statement about your character
[21:16] <vurtual> Every day?
[21:16] <vurtual> You have to re-start it EVERY DAY?
[21:16] * Emphursis (user@95.144.146.30) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[21:16] <vurtual> Stop closing it EVERY DAY
[21:16] <Mithril> <vurtual> You have to re-start it EVERY DAY? - I turn off my PC after using it
[21:16] <vurtual> Why would you do that?
[21:16] <Mithril> I dunno
[21:16] <vurtual> You're not saving much power.
[21:16] <Mithril> Im used to do that
[21:17] <vurtual> It's just wasting time.
[21:17] <Mithril> I did that earlier when Standby still sucked on PCs
[21:17] <vurtual> okay here's a thing
[21:17] <Mithril> so im just too used to it
[21:17] <Mithril> and Im running a windows PC
[21:17] <vurtual> start mirc, and then never close it. Never shut down your computer, except when updating(in bulk) or due to reasons requiring a specific restart.
[21:18] <LuciferZ> Yeah man. Doing something dumb because you're used to it is pretty... dumb I guess
[21:18] <vurtual> If it starts getting slow, this is a user malpractice problem.

[21:20] <LuciferZ> If you were used to eating something kind of gross, because of percieved benefits, and then discovered that not only were the benefits false, but it was also a carcinogen, why keep eating it?
[21:21] <Wervyn> I know, right? You could always not use mIRC, there are other clients.
[21:22] <LuciferZ> That's what he does Wervyn
[21:22] <Snowman> Hmmm...
[21:22] <Wervyn> Ah, didn't scroll up far enough.
[21:22] <Snowman> You know what they should do?
[21:22] <LuciferZ> We're just explaining that his reason for disliking mIRC is illogical.
[21:22] <LuciferZ> Who is 'they' Snowman?

[21:23] <LuciferZ> Hey have you noticed that pretty much every furry on the planet likes TF2? It's really weird. Normal people like it too of course.
[21:23] <Wervyn> What, the nag screen? I think that's a valid reason to switch to something that doesn't nag you. Even if you do only boot it up infrequently.
[21:23] <LuciferZ> But furries fucking love that shit

[21:26] <LuciferZ> :G
[21:27] <Kizzycocoa> though, portal is a favorite of theirs.
[21:28] <rob`> who doesn't love portal?
[21:28] <Mithril> I want multiplayer surv
[21:29] <Wervyn> So does everyone.
[21:29] <Kizzycocoa> exactly. I'm making a mod for portal. is slow work though x.x
[21:29] <LuciferZ> Heh, everyone who hasn't gotten an invite yet
[21:29] <Kizzycocoa> and portal 2 messed everything
[21:29] <rob`> any word on portal 2's release date?
[21:29] <Snowman> Fall 2010
[21:30] <rob`> spiffy
[21:31] <Wervyn> Maybe by then there'll also be some news on episode 3 damnit Valve.
[21:31] <vurtual> you know where you can be reading a sentence but you don't get it, so you re-read it and you cna never properly parse the sentence?
[21:31] <vurtual> Well every sentence is getting like that for me.
[21:31] <Wervyn> How long have you been awake?
[21:31] <vurtual> I woke up around 1-2am

[22:24] <vurtual> so how is this sane at al
[22:24] <vurtual> why does the longstrike cost 34 dollars
[22:24] <vurtual> I could build a scrap gun for that
[22:24] <Plus-san> what do gears do anyway
[22:24] <Miclee> Stuff in the skin file is old.

[22:26] <Plus-san> apples that drop randomly from trees
[22:26] <Miclee> It's called placeholders.
[22:27] <Kizzycocoa> ah, ok. I just thoght apples would be implemented now if at all, as sprites dropping are fairly common in minecraft
[22:27] <Kizzycocoa> *thought
[22:28] <Miclee> Apples were in the game, Notch is just trying to find ways to add them in that make sense.
[22:28] <Wervyn> Well "they grow on trees" seems like it would make sense. But maybe we need different kinds of trees.
[22:28] <Kizzycocoa> ah, fair enough.
[22:29] <Miclee> Yeah, but Notch would have to rewrite the tree generation and such for that to happen.
[22:29] <Kizzycocoa> makes sense really. I mean it's cannabalism or nothing
[22:29] <Kizzycocoa> so, apples make sense
[22:29] <Wervyn> So far trees just drop tiny trees. So they're like, tree trees.
[22:29] <Plus-san> make trees drop apples instead of saplings at a 10% rate
[22:29] <Plus-san> ????
[22:29] <Plus-san> pforit
[22:29] <Miclee> Yes, but not really a priority.
[22:29] <Kizzycocoa> ah, ok. that makes sense I guess
[22:30] <vurtual> appled leaf
[22:30] <vurtual> a special kind of leaf, that makes apple
[22:30] <vurtual> when cut
[22:30] <vurtual> click with hoe=get unappled leaf block on spot, and apple.
[22:30] <Plus-san> sounds unnecessarialy complicates
[22:30] <Wervyn> Forrester seems like it would be up to the task of generating different types of tree growth, so that might be an option.
[22:31] <Kizzycocoa> what's this checkered armour stuff?

[22:36] <Kizzycocoa> same. infdev is laggy to me
[22:36] <Kizzycocoa> even with full fog
[22:36] <Kizzycocoa> ugh. minecraft gets boring after a while. I made a big member building thing for MP indev for fun. took 3 days, is epic and I cannot share it. D:

[22:37] <rob`> it'll be awesome

[22:57] <vurtual> firstly
[22:57] <vurtual> why would minecraft need a moddb page, kizzycocoa1?

[22:57] <kizzycocoa1> well

[22:57] <kizzycocoa1> texture packs
[22:57] <Shori> oh
[22:57] <vurtual> moddb is for stuff like actual mapping
[22:57] <Shori> probably thx2mibbit, Vurtual :p
[22:58] <kizzycocoa1> yes. you can make maps in minecraft
[22:58] <vurtual> actual real mapping.
[22:58] <vurtual> no, that is not mapping
[22:58] <vurtual> that's slapping blocks together in a grid
[22:58] <vurtual> and then passing it off as a map
[22:58] <Shori> I'd consider it mapping
[22:58] <vurtual> it is nothing compared to actual mapping
[22:58] <Shori> jump maps, for example :D
[22:58] <vurtual> which is effort
[22:58] <kizzycocoa1> I think you'll find, I put 3 days into this map
[22:59] <vurtual> mapping takes months
[22:59] <kizzycocoa1> not really
[22:59] <vurtual> actual mapping.
[22:59] <kizzycocoa1> not when lighting is immediate
[22:59] <vurtual> the kind that goes on moddb
[22:59] <vurtual> and practically a degree, but there's no schools for it, beyond the school of hard knocks. and internet.
[22:59] <Shori> Mapping only takes months when A: You're bad
[22:59] <kizzycocoa1> and all stuff is generated in-game
[22:59] <Shori> B: The game isn't very easy to map in
[22:59] <vurtual> shori, we're talking about actual projects here.
[22:59] <vurtual> well not months
[22:59] <Shori> Or C: You're bad
[22:59] <vurtual> but it can take a month if it's a big project

[23:02] <kizzycocoa1> yes
[23:02] <kizzycocoa1> minecraft will also have them
[23:02] <vurtual> not contraptions

[23:03] <kizzycocoa1> so, it is a valid statement to say that minecraft's maps are going to get harder to make for gamemodes
[23:03] <kizzycocoa1> EG< D&L
[23:03] <kizzycocoa1> pressure pads
[23:03] <kizzycocoa1> technical placement of powerups
[23:03] <kizzycocoa1> careful placing of mobs
[23:03] <vurtual> notch never said anything like that is going to happen
[23:03] <kizzycocoa1> etc.
[23:03] <vurtual> well, maybe dungeon mode
[23:03] <kizzycocoa1> he did
[23:03] <kizzycocoa1> that is D&L :/
[23:03] <vurtual> But right now, minecraft "mapping" is just slapping together a few blocks to make something "cool"
[23:04] <vurtual> at most you'll have some massively shiny project that is basically a gigantic walk-through art piece, but that's not what moddb is for.
[23:04] <kizzycocoa1> I think you'll find, mapping is only like that in creative
[23:04] <vurtual> survival isn't about "mapping
[23:04] <vurtual> "Look, I did the same, but slower! Praise meeee!"
[23:04] <kizzycocoa1> in indev, it takes AGES
[23:04] <vurtual> also chances are you'd probably get laughed out for trying to make a minecraft thing on moddb.
[23:04] <kizzycocoa1> you have to get resources, craft, burn etc.
[23:05] <vurtual> Yes, it just takes longer.
[23:05] <vurtual> Is it worth your time, if you're trying to make a "map"?
[23:05] <kizzycocoa1> not really :/
[23:05] <vurtual> I could build maps out of 1x1x1 brushes in hammer. Should I get a medal?
[23:05] <kizzycocoa1> wow. you really do not appreciate anyone's time spent in minecraft at all, do you?
[23:05] <vurtual> Firstly no since most of their projects are either speed-built or lame(even mine are lame)
[23:06] <vurtual> and secondly it's not a mod, or actual mapping. It's just making stuff
[23:06] <kizzycocoa1> http://www.moddb.com/members/kizzycocoa/images
[23:06] <vurtual> there are already sites to show that off
[23:06] <kizzycocoa1> discuss
[23:06] <vurtual> skins are just blocky textures that there are many sites for
[23:06] <kizzycocoa1> took about a day to make the basics
[23:06] <kizzycocoa1> 3 more to finish
[23:06] <kizzycocoa1> a full day.
[23:06] <vurtual> you are slow.
[23:06] <kizzycocoa1> AKA NO SOCIAL LIFE.
[23:06] <kizzycocoa1> etc.
[23:06] <vurtual> I have less of a social life than you could ever imagine
[23:07] <kizzycocoa1> howso?
[23:07] <vurtual> and nobody's going to fawn over something just because you spent a long time doing it for no worthy reason.
[23:07] <kizzycocoa1> well, you mustn't spend a lot socialising online either :/
[23:07] <vurtual> I live in the middle of nowhere, I'm crazy, I spend my entire life sitting at this computer
[23:07] <vurtual> the whole thing
[23:07] <vurtual> If I'm not just outside in the wild, or doing something like eating or occasionally watching tv
[23:07] <vurtual> I'm at my computer
[23:08] <vurtual> I don't even have uptimes anymore.
[23:08] <kizzycocoa1> regardless, minecraft does deserve it. take 5 seconds to look through the picture thread, and you'd probably disagree
[23:08] <Seiseki> vurtual, you don't need to have a mod-able game to be on Moddb..
[23:08] <kizzycocoa1> but that's as you don't appreciate the effort put into it

[23:14] * pontusedberg (Mibbit@c83-253-234-103.bredband.comhem.se) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)

[23:15] <kizzycocoa1> well, I can add it. I will ask him, I was just asking for thoughts.
[23:15] <vurtual> okay you run off and try to do your nothing
[23:15] <kizzycocoa1> then this *storm happened
[23:15] <Seiseki> it would bring more players and more attention to the game

[23:16] <MarkofBear> i actually agree with Seiseki
[23:16] <MarkofBear> it would be a good way to attract more people
[23:16] <vurtual> You sure love demonizing me eh
[23:17] <vurtual> if you can convince notch to have a moddb page for minecraft, constantly updated with all sorts of development-related stuff, then ok
[23:17] <MarkofBear> meh it doesnt need to be updated always
[23:17] <MarkofBear> or im sure that other people are willing to do that
[23:18] <MarkofBear> the important part is to be seen
[23:18] <kizzycocoa1> it doesn't have to be
[23:18] <vurtual> not sure how the moddb guys like having other people do the updates
[23:18] <Seiseki> well if someone could pull up the statistics of how many people visit the site daily I'm sure he'd agree
[23:18] <kizzycocoa1> a link to the dev blog would suffice
[23:18] <MarkofBear> just some pics and so on
[23:18] <MarkofBear> nd a link to the dev blog as kizzy said
[23:18] <kizzycocoa1> yeah.
[23:18] <MarkofBear> maybe some reviews
[23:18] <vurtual> How many of them are going to play creative-block-game that's only really popular in the indie community?
[23:18] <Seiseki> well if you post news it shows up on the moddb first page which is what you want really
[23:18] <kizzycocoa1> I sent an email. if I get an ok, I'll go ahead with it
[23:18] <MarkofBear> i mean... you get the idea of it
[23:19] <Seiseki> vurtual, moddb is an indie community
[23:19] <MarkofBear> yeah
[23:19] <Seiseki> people who like mods like indie games
[23:19] <kizzycocoa1> who's going to play a game involving holes in the wall?
[23:19] <MarkofBear> what he said
[23:19] <Seiseki> which is why there are a lot of mods
[23:19] <kizzycocoa1> or it's sequel?
[23:19] <vurtual> Yeah, but moddb's the side of bigger projects
[23:19] <Seiseki> and which is why Overgrowth won most anticipated indie title of the year

[23:20] <Jolinar> D:
[23:20] <Jolinar> Hey
[23:20] <MarkofBear> hai
[23:20] <vurtual> moddb isn't exactly java coders and fast-make-simple-game.
[23:20] <kizzycocoa1> also, he's nearly a full-time indie game maker
[23:20] <MarkofBear> notch hasnt been on for a while has he?
[23:20] <vurtual> Also I'm being locked in a blank white room right now.
[23:20] <vurtual> I'm not allowed outside
[23:20] <MarkofBear> again?
[23:20] <Jolinar> So uh
[23:20] <vurtual> which is very unhealthy for me.
[23:20] <Jolinar> When will dynamic water be added to infdev?
[23:20] <Jolinar> :[
[23:20] <vurtual> when it's done
[23:20] <Seiseki> minecraft isn't really a fast and simple game either
[23:20] <MarkofBear> apparently to be locked inside a blank white room is like death
[23:21] <vurtual> For hours
[23:21] <MarkofBear> well gonna play cya
[23:21] <vurtual> A bit sleep deprived, and having spent nearly every day normally going outside and preforming extremely exhausting physical acts?
[23:21] <vurtual> It's very torturous.
[23:21] <MarkofBear> i loved it
[23:21] <Seiseki> there are a few very simple looking indie games on moddb too though
[23:21] <Seiseki> http://www.moddb.com/games?filter=t&kw=Search+...&released=def&style=def&theme=def&indie=2&type=def
[23:22] <vurtual> that url has ellipsisey that's not safe

[23:23] <MarkofBear> because it proves you wrong?
[23:23] <Seiseki> ...right..
[23:23] <vurtual> it isn't a valid url
[23:23] <MarkofBear> dont be a troll
[23:23] <MarkofBear> and the games loaded
[23:23] <kizzycocoa1> brb
[23:23] <Seiseki> it works for me
[23:23] <MarkofBear> have fun trying to nag each other to death .D
[23:24] <vurtual> so it just proves that games question filter equal t and kw equal search plus dotdotdot released equal def and style equal def and theme equal def and indie equal two and type equal def
[23:24] * Smoo (Smoo@cpe-67-240-72-99.nycap.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[23:24] <vurtual> Also I forget that that style is typing doesn't come accross as sarcastic as it should to you guys.
[23:24] <Jolinar> So uh
[23:24] <Jolinar> How deep is the lava on infdev
[23:25] <Jolinar> I know it's.. really deep
[23:25] <vurtual> forever
[23:25] <vurtual> it's an infinite depth
[23:25] <vurtual> it's not a block either
[23:25] <vurtual> it's just how the game handles below the bottom block
[23:25] <Jolinar> so you can't reach the core?
[23:25] <Jolinar> :<
[23:25] <vurtual> no
[23:25] <vurtual> not without lots of armors forever
[23:25] <vurtual> you can reach THE SUN though
[23:26] <vurtual> "How will we reach the sun!?" "Dig through the mantle, and swim to the sun when it's recharging below us!"
[23:26] * ZzZ|Dae is now known as Dae
[23:26] <vurtual> anyways I'm suffering from a bit of psychosis and listening to some very twisted music.
[23:27] <vurtual> and the voices in my head are like seek medical attention, and the jeapordy theme. At this point if I don't just sprint for freedom I'll go crazy.
[23:27] <Seiseki> btw, notch said the problem with making blocks that are floating fall to the ground is that with infinite maps you can't tell code-wise if a block is attached to something if it's on the end of the map which hasn't been loaded yet..
[23:27] <Seiseki> but isn't the same true for leaves on trees?

[23:28] <vurtual> why
[23:28] <supersimme> iam going to buy the game but paypal wont work for me
[23:28] <vurtual> I'm not the one to help with it
[23:28] <vurtual> also I'm insane anyways
[23:28] <supersimme> so i cant buy it over paypal and i wonder if there is any other site i could pay to?
[23:28] <supersimme> i ask everyone
[23:28] <Dommys> Paypal
[23:28] <Dommys> Make it work
[23:28] <Seiseki> I just want leaves to disappear like they do in indev, I hate having floating leaves everywhere and it's a pain to remove them by hand
[23:29] <supersimme> i cant make it work
[23:29] <Dommys> Paypal is the only way.
[23:29] <Dommys> One of your friends has paypal.
[23:29] <supersimme> it says i need proof of my adress or something. well i sent them a bill with adress and name as they said but they wont accept it.
[23:29] <Dommys> Give them the cash, and have them buy it
[23:29] <supersimme> dont know anyone who has it
[23:30] <supersimme> :P
[23:30] <supersimme> any moderator that can help me?
[23:30] <Dommys> Yeah
[23:30] <Dommys> I am.
[23:30] <Dommys> I just told you
[23:30] <Dommys> Paypal.
[23:30] <supersimme> notch must have some other kind of solution

[23:33] <whatdoesth> I'm not so sure why you're so quick to defend paypal, actually.
[23:34] <whatdoesth> It's fine as a temporary solution, but it's a good point, there really should eventually be other methods of payment.
[23:34] <hyperhopper> does anybody know which version will become survival, /infdev/ or /indev/?
[23:35] <Dommys> lol.

[23:35] <whatdoesth> What? Paypal has a history of shady activity and customer abuse, many people dislike doing business with paypal, or have issues like supersimme.
[23:36] <Dommys> All lies.
[23:36] <Dommys> Lies and slander.
[23:36] <whatdoesth> No, not really.
[23:36] <Konogan> Yes, really.

[23:36] <Dommys> Yes, really
[23:36] <whatdoesth> Google "somethingawful paypal"
[23:36] <vede-learns> infdev is just a newer indev.
[23:36] <Dommys> Oh he's the only goon alive!!
[23:36] <whatdoesth> That alone speaks for itself.
[23:36] <supersimme> is there any way for me to contact notch?
[23:36] <Dommys> He's the only one who's ever read SA
[23:36] <Dommys> Oh god
[23:37] <vede-learns> supersimme, email, and he's here occasionally, but not very much recently.
[23:37] <Dommys> He bears the true knowledge that the rest of the internet has abstained from
[23:37] <supersimme> whats hes email address?
[23:37] <whatdoesth> Your sarcasm brings so much to the table.
[23:37] <Dommys> Go to the site, it's available.

[23:40] <supersimme> is notch from sweden does anyone know for sure?

[23:40] <Dommys> supersimme lol..
[23:40] <Mithril> skip to 0:40 btw
[23:40] <whatdoesth> Actually, you're the one saying that paypal is right and supersimme is wrong, when bills are a legitimate form of ID.

[23:48] <Dommys> Can you?

[23:53] <vurtual> I'm very unique here because I had a very unlikely upbringing for such a location, so nobody here expects someone like me.
[23:53] <Dommys> You mean you're more intelligent? or just different?
[23:53] <Furyhunter> well, you could go to that psychiatrist to get your mom to realize she's wasting her money
[23:53] <vurtual> psychiatrists wouldn't know anything either
[23:54] <vurtual> also, mental institutions.
[23:54] <Dommys> I went to a Psychiatrist once
[23:54] <Dommys> It was an interesting meeting.
[23:54] <vurtual> also, I'd end up quoting the matrix to screw with his head(it's my hobby) and then he'd try to diagnose me improperly.
[23:54] <vurtual> unless the pros are better than I think, and I'm already being optimistic

[23:56] <vurtual> you don't
[23:56] <vurtual> I'd preferably quote the one where Anderson has to deal with the smiths in the interrogation room.

[23:58] <vurtual> And instead of one phone call, I'd say something like "You get out of the way betwen me and the closest exit, before I give your head a modern indian trail of tears leading up your behind."
[23:58] <Dommys> vurtual, lol, you might could do with actually talking some of your issues out with someone, but Psychiatry only works if you want to use it that way. If you go into it thinking it's something you have to defend against, it's not going to help, and everyone ends up wasting their time.
[23:58] <KodaichiZero> I wish I had a horse. I loooooove horses.
[23:58] <vurtual> I have no issues.
[23:58] <Dommys> On the other hand, your mother sounds like a Lunatic.
[23:58] <vurtual> There are lots of people like me.
