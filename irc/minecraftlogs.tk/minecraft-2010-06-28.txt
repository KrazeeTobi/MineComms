[0:03] <Demki> it is a combination of infdev and my graphics card.
[0:03] <Demki> and LG, no.
[0:03] <Demki> I didn't.
[0:03] <LG_Legacy> Try it
[0:03] <Classiest|Infdev|Saddles> i plan to separate it from the shore and flatten it out
[0:03] <Demki> LG, I tried it.
[0:03] <Demki> you've seen the pics.
[0:03] <Classiest|Infdev|Saddles> looks like i have the same lighting issues
[0:04] <Classiest|Infdev|Saddles> ohwait nvm

[0:06] <Quatroking> 22:05, 27 June 2010 Quatroking (Talk | contribs | block) changed group membership for User:TrueWolves from (none) to Administrators ??? (butts)
[0:06] <Demki> oh, one more weird thing
[0:06] <Quatroking> Go moderate and shit
[0:06] <TrueWolves> Alright.
[0:06] <Quatroking> :D
[0:06] <Demki> when holding an ITEM(torch, sword...), the block items aren't being lit at all
[0:06] <TrueWolves> I'm not 100% sure I can do so now, but I will when able.
[0:06] <Quatroking> Its getting hard to deal with 100 edits a day
[0:06] <Quatroking> anyone else feel like moderating?
[0:06] <Demki> when holding a block item/nothing, they are being lit the way you've seen in the pic.
[0:07] <Classiest|Infdev|Saddles> i wonder if the new grate thingyss
[0:07] <Classiest|Infdev|Saddles> are possible to hold
[0:07] <LG_Legacy> Demki I'm going to try a test
[0:07] <Classiest|Infdev|Saddles> like in your inventory
[0:07] <Demki> Classiest, yes.
[0:07] <LG_Legacy> Once i get done copying my world
[0:07] <Demki> you need a pickaxe(even wood) to destroy them.

[0:10] <blaster> Guys I have a horrible idea
[0:10] <blaster> What if ants are becoming more intelligent?
[0:11] <blaster> After all, their evolution right now favours better ant colonies
[0:11] <Conundrumer> they will realize the totalitarian society they live in
[0:11] <Conundrumer> and overthrow their queen
[0:11] <blaster> and they need bigger brains to be able to do that
[0:11] <Conundrumer> and create a communist regime
[0:11] * sppt (i@ip545125db.direct-adsl.nl) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[0:11] <blaster> conundrumer they are communist
[0:11] <visiON__> So I just realized my NOTACTIVATED anti virus program was clogging my internetr
[0:11] <blaster> except for the queen
[0:11] <visiON__> its uninstalled now :)
[0:12] <blaster> but they look after the queen because of her ability to create new ants
[0:12] * CruelNoise (cruelnoise@64-7-147-93.agas1a-dynamic.dsl.sentex.ca) has joined #minecraft
[0:12] <blaster> Its not like the queen does nothing

[0:12] <blaster> Also ever heard of hypercolonies
[0:12] <Conundrumer> reminds me of zergs
[0:13] <blaster> which is multiple colonies connected by long underground roads
[0:13] <Conundrumer> nope
[0:13] <visiON__> ants will take over the world
[0:13] <visiON__> some day
[0:13] <Conundrumer> so that means colonies support each other?

[0:23] <Conundrumer> it should work, even with ONLY the .dat file
[0:23] <bildramer> visiON, wat
[0:23] <visiON__> F11 only makes browser fullscreen
[0:23] <visiON__> not the java applet
[0:23] <visiON__> i think
[0:23] <Conundrumer> that's how i duplicate worlds when i don't want to transfer huge amounts of files

[0:24] <visiON__> so
[0:24] <visiON__> how many of you discriminate smokers?
[0:24] <Snowman> I think they all should die
[0:24] <LG_Legacy> Hm
[0:24] <visiON__> but smoking gurls are super hawt
[0:24] <Conundrumer> i have not much respect for them
[0:24] <Snowman> But they're doing their best to make that happen themselves already
[0:24] <LG_Legacy> NBT Forge won't open up my save
[0:24] <visiON__> thats why i smoke
[0:24] <Snowman> Smoking girls are NOT hot
[0:24] <sorre> i hope my save is unborked
[0:25] <visiON__> im super hot when smoking
[0:25] <Snowman> And their breath smells
[0:25] <visiON__> your argument is invalid
[0:25] <Konogan> Blaster, I just finished my island generator thingy. it takes approximately 1 minute to gen and you can resize the window. http://www.filefront.com/16885913/islandgen.rar
[0:25] <bildramer> <Snowman> I think they all should die
[0:25] <visiON__> my bf smokes too so idc about brath :P
[0:25] <Snowman> It's super hot when you need to be alone every hour
[0:25] <bildramer> except relatives
[0:25] <bildramer> wait
[0:25] <Conundrumer> what is this about?
[0:25] <bildramer> there's a better solution
[0:25] <Conundrumer> wait what, bf?
[0:25] <bildramer> just instantly destroy any sign of nicotine
[0:25] <Conundrumer> a girl on the internet? preposterous!
[0:25] <visiON__> news flash: there are gurls on the internet
[0:25] <bildramer> and anything that can create it
[0:26] <Conundrumer> also, is that islandgen for indev?
[0:26] <Konogan> no.
[0:26] <Snowman> There are plenty of them
[0:26] <Snowman> But since all men act like they can tap them, most of them don't openly admit it
[0:26] <bildramer> wait wait what.
[0:26] <Konogan> Only a random generator I made for fun. :D
[0:26] <bildramer> "super hot"
[0:26] <bildramer> no.
[0:26] <bildramer> just no
[0:26] <Snowman> Also, most girls on the internet aren't super hot
[0:26] <bildramer> smoking is only hot in the case of accidental fires
[0:26] <Snowman> Except facebook, but that's not really the internet
[0:27] <Conundrumer> agreed

[0:32] <Snowman> About 10,000 muons reach every square meter of the earth's surface a minute; these charged particles form as by-products of cosmic rays colliding with molecules in the upper atmosphere. Traveling at relativistic speeds, muons can penetrate tens of meters into rocks and other matter before attenuating as a result of absorption or deflection by other atoms.
[0:32] <Keiya> has running water always had a sound?
[0:32] <bildramer> nicotine will give you cancer even if not pure

[1:04] <Ominus> wasabi, works on old maps but you need to go to unexplored areas to find the rooms
[1:04] <Azathoth> i thought that was the whole reason for them doing the episodic thing
[1:04] <Celdur> yeah, thats the whole point of episodic games :P
[1:04] <CruelNoise> snowman, are you still running your skin thing?
[1:04] <Celdur> that they come out frequently

[1:56] <wolf_alex> http://www.livestream.com/wolfalexs_den streaming infdev
[1:56] <wolf_alex> come watch :D
[1:56] <blaster> But then you could make a varient
[1:57] <blaster> Where the attacker rolls defender rolls 4
[1:57] <blaster> to make combat faster
[1:57] <blaster> attacker rolls 6
[1:57] <blaster> Or make each territory worth half
[1:58] <Drakkar> lame
[1:58] <Drakkar> no full world map
[1:58] <Drakkar> oh well
[1:58] <blaster> The thing that I like about risk is that you can make variants easily
[1:58] <blaster> Its like the game was made to be modded
[1:59] <vurtual> so apparently these whole massive bombers covered in turrets
[1:59] <vurtual> can't land on their belly
[1:59] <vurtual> like, nobody thought of that?

[2:39] <Liam|Yiff_Pudding> i don't want to destroy it, cause knowing my luck - it'll explode
[2:40] <GvJordan> open :/ but still!
[2:40] <ClassiestMedic> no it's safe
[2:40] <ClassiestMedic> take screenbies first
[2:40] <Perry> Mob spawn point
[2:40] <Perry> Look closer, I doubt it's a sign
[2:40] <Perry> Nope, it won't

[2:40] <ClassiestMedic> screenies
[2:40] <Perry> Take the cage
[2:40] <ClassiestMedic> what does the cage do?
[2:40] <Snowman> clothify is a bit too overpowering
[2:40] <ClassiestMedic> i heard it was a fireplace or something
[2:40] <shairn> it's a mob spawner
[2:40] <Snowman> Also, sea isn't brown
[2:40] <Perry> ClassiestMedic: Mob spawn point
[2:40] <shairn> spawns whatever is spinning in it
[2:40] <Visiiri> blaster get your ass and your risk maps out of here :|
[2:41] <Snowman> And the lines look too pixelly
[2:41] <ClassiestMedic> ah

[2:41] <setveen> moo
[2:41] <ClassiestMedic> I am SO taking like five of those with NBTedit
[2:41] <blaster> If you gave reasons your points would make more sence
[2:41] <ClassiestMedic> and putting them above my creeper trap
[2:41] <ClassiestMedic> Muahahaha
[2:41] <Visiiri> It's just stupid seeing you come in here at random saying "Ohey, I did something". That's spam.

[2:42] <Classiest|Infdev> Pork is tasty
[2:42] <Classiest|Infdev> nom nom nom
[2:42] <shairn> I put 20 cages in a square
[2:42] <shairn> pork everywhere
[2:42] <Visiiri> Quatroking's flash stuff is worth looking at
[2:42] <shairn> filled 2 large chests
[2:42] <Visiiri> a risk map is not
[2:42] <shairn> still more lying about
[2:42] <Classiest|Infdev> true, vis
[2:42] <blaster> Visiiri risk is epix
[2:42] <Snowman> It is worth looking at
[2:42] <rob`> is it possible to make cages currently
[2:42] <Snowman> If it looks good
[2:43] <Classiest|Infdev> holy shit
[2:43] <Classiest|Infdev> lol
[2:43] <Classiest|Infdev> lots of pork
[2:43] <blaster> Snowman does mine look good/playable?
[2:43] <Classiest|Infdev> no, rob
[2:43] <Classiest|Infdev> it isnt'
[2:43] <Visiiri> They're not cages
[2:43] <Visiiri> they're gates
[2:43] <Visiiri> clearly

[2:44] <blaster> I wanted clear text
[2:44] <Snowman> Comic sans is ugly

[2:44] <Snowman> Or when going for the old style, a serif font
[2:44] <Drakkar> tahoma is great
[2:44] <blaster> I used, in this order, blur edges, apply canvas, clothify
[2:44] <Drakkar> wait
[2:45] <Drakkar> is tahoma the type-writer font?
[2:45] <Classiest|Infdev> anyone know of an infdev level editor/viewer like OMEN?
[2:45] <Snowman> Not sure
[2:45] <Drakkar> its one of the Ts
[2:45] <Perry> I prefer arial
[2:45] <blaster> I hate serif fonts
[2:45] <Classiest|Infdev> i do not believe NBTedit can handle infdev
[2:45] <blaster> I dont care if it looks old
[2:45] <blaster> they are unreadable imo
[2:45] <Snowman> blaster, same, but they look good on older maps
[2:45] <shairn> use NBTforge
[2:45] <shairn> it handles infdev
[2:45] <Snowman> Also, you picture does not look old
[2:45] <Drakkar> I like to use it for my first draft manuscripts
[2:45] <Classiest|Infdev> NBTforge!
[2:45] <Drakkar> and then I move up to a seperate font
[2:45] <Classiest|Infdev> for infdev!
[2:45] <Classiest|Infdev> holy shit
[2:45] <shairn> yes
[2:45] <Drakkar> so when I open a manuscript I know what draft it is
[2:45] <Classiest|Infdev> shairn
[2:45] <blaster> Snowman back when these military maps were made in the 1800's
[2:45] <blaster> do you think they would of looked old
[2:46] <Classiest|Infdev> is this a recent update
[2:46] <blaster> they would be canvas
[2:46] <blaster> but not old
[2:46] <shairn> I dunno
[2:46] <Classiest|Infdev> for nbtforge
[2:46] <shairn> but it works
[2:46] <Classiest|Infdev> hmn
[2:46] <Classiest|Infdev> ok
[2:46] <Classiest|Infdev> afk
[2:46] <Snowman> Yeah, but now they look old

[2:54] <blaster> Thats a standard attack against a standard defence

[2:57] <ZaxKellens> ... Hn
[2:57] <Crix> Too bad they dont still spawn enemies after you pick them up!
[2:57] <shairn> that would be cheap
[2:57] <Crix> You could make mob farms so easily :D
[2:57] <shairn> exactly
[2:57] <shairn> you still can anyway
[2:57] <ZaxKellens> So you can ride pigs, but you can't control them?
[2:57] <shairn> just dig around the cage
[2:57] <FNugget> Does anyone know how high a pig has to fall to die on impact, btw?
[2:57] <shairn> yup
[2:57] <ZaxKellens> Hn

[2:58] <shairn> unless you use cartographer or the like, very
[2:58] <Crix> sometimes its easy sometimes hard
[2:58] <ZaxKellens> Is it close or far away from spawn?

[3:31] <Kokopure> my trap was going to be hard for me to get out of the collection pit of it
[3:31] <Perry> XD
[3:31] <Kokopure> due to the level of water on the inside.
[3:31] <Kokopure> guess how I fixed this?
[3:31] <Perry> tell us :D
[3:31] <Kokopure> I just had to make the ladders lower!
[3:31] <ZaxKellens> Secret room such a load
[3:31] <Perry> ...!
[3:31] <Kokopure> but then I was like "hrm, but then the ladders block some glass O_o oh wait, I can just make the glass lower."
[3:32] <Kokopure> so I went ahead and made the glass lower.
[3:32] <Kokopure> so I'm like "thank god I fixed that problem."
[3:32] <Kokopure> and then I looked at it
[3:32] <Kokopure> and realized that by lowering both the glass and my ladders
[3:32] <Kokopure> ... the water level was now the problem again
[3:32] <Perry> Fun fact: There are currently three people on the channel whose name starts with a z and all three have an a following their z.
[3:32] <Kokopure> meaning I just lowered my trap two blocks into the ground for nothing

[6:00] <Iguana> Remake?
[6:00] <CruelNoise> XD
[6:00] <vurtual> also, tripple battles.
[6:00] <Iguana> OHWAIT
[6:00] <Iguana> Pokemanz
[6:00] <vurtual> 3 vs 3
[6:00] <vurtual> at once
[6:01] <Iguana> I thought you were talkin' 'bout Black and White
[6:01] <Iguana> RTS thingy
[6:01] <CruelNoise> so, what's #minecraft 's opinion on black and white (the pokemon games)?
[6:02] <CruelNoise> i haven't been following the conversation
[6:02] <vurtual> It's not as bad as diamond/perl/platinum/lisp
[6:02] <vurtual> but the new pokemons are still ugly :(
[6:02] <vurtual> If I could, I'd try to pal park some rse pokemon
[6:02] <vurtual> too bad you can't just... get a second pokemon, rather than sending them
[6:02] <Visiiri> God I need a midget translator
[6:02] <vurtual> so I can get my blaziken over :D
[6:02] <Visiiri> :|
[6:02] <Snowman> The francise was milked enough after Gold and Silver
[6:03] <CruelNoise> i think
[6:03] <CruelNoise> that they should make a pokemon antholgy, and just end it all there
[6:03] <vurtual> so, my friend is starting a new wow character
[6:03] <CruelNoise> also, i just got back from watching The A-Team
[6:03] <CruelNoise> good movie
[6:04] <vurtual> blood elf horde paladin named "hordadin"

[6:05] <Iguana> those things are over-rated

[6:05] <vurtual> some play runescape, even.
[6:05] <CruelNoise> iguana, i agree so much
[6:05] <CruelNoise> HEY
[6:05] <CruelNoise> I DO THAT
[6:05] <vurtual> But they're also in their 20s, so they're okay.
[6:05] <vurtual> unlike you 15 year olds
[6:05] <vurtual> and some of them smoke weed.
[6:06] <vurtual> Actually, lots of them do.
[6:06] <CruelNoise> weed is for fucks
[6:06] <CruelNoise> fuck the weed, you fucking fucks
[6:06] <Iguana> Runescape is only okay if you're playing with some guy who likes to rage a lot
[6:06] <vurtual> screw you man
[6:06] <Iguana> And it's even better when you guys are in the same TS3 channel
[6:06] <Iguana> And he rages when things do more damage than him
[6:06] <vurtual> Iguana, and then his stoner-sounding cousin told him to play DDO
[6:06] <vurtual> so all is forgiven
[6:06] <Snowman> Playing weed and playing mmorpgs
[6:06] <vurtual> except I already got bored of playing that

[6:07] <CruelNoise> life
[6:07] <vurtual> It's not exactly dangerous.
[6:07] <vurtual> I mean, it doesn't hurt you.
[6:07] <vurtual> It's not very addictive either.

[6:08] <CruelNoise> my schools never had cafeterias, bty
[6:08] <vurtual> It's not dangerously addictive, it doesn't hurt people
[6:08] <CruelNoise> btw
[6:08] <Snowman> Inhaling hot gasses has never been a good idea
[6:08] <CruelNoise> then why is it outlawed?
[6:08] <vurtual> well then we have the bong
[6:08] <SireTRM> CruelNoise, that's what the FDA decided to do. . .
[6:08] <vurtual> CruelNoise, well, that's the confusing aprt
[6:09] <vurtual> there was some reason, ages ago, a large amount of hate over it
[6:09] <vurtual> even George Washington grew it.
[6:09] <vurtual> it makes cheap paper.
[6:09] <SireTRM> Not to mention the fact the FDA can't tell the difference between 'weed' and industrial/feral hemp
[6:09] <SireTRM> While Canada, China, and Europe can.
[6:09] <vurtual> Yeah but china's china
[6:10] <SireTRM> Conclusion: America fails.
[6:10] <Snowman> Legalising weed isn't a good idea
[6:10] <Snowman> http://cheezcomixed.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/2809-copy.jpg

[6:12] <Iguana> Let's just do mass suicide

[6:35] <AndrewPH> no
[6:35] <PuyoDead> In case you haven't heard, Google > 2204355 > I'm feeling lucky.
[6:36] <vurtual> that leads to some flash files
[6:36] <vurtual> I'm not that dumb.
[6:36] <vurtual> I google.
[6:36] <CruelNoise> what does that mean?
[6:36] <PuyoDead> And vurtual demonstrates his paranoia.
[6:36] <vurtual> Yep.
[6:37] <AndrewPH> Masshuu, let's talk about corey behind his back
[6:37] <vurtual> Let's talk about AndrewPH infront of his back
[6:37] <vurtual> he's lame.
[6:37] <AndrewPH> PuyoDead, CHIKEn
[6:37] <CruelNoise> hey, vurutal
[6:38] <CruelNoise> vurtual, andrewph is a very strange person
[6:38] <CruelNoise> he has a voice like that of a twelve-year-old vagina
[6:38] <CruelNoise> i heard him talk once

[6:39] <CruelNoise> when my mother asks me to snuggle
[6:39] <vurtual> ...snuggle?
[6:39] <CruelNoise> i get the feeling that it means something different from what it means when other mothers ask their children to snuggle...
[6:39] <vurtual> I guess that's what you get from someone who has a Japanese sounding name

[6:40] <PuyoDead> Hey AndrewPH, did anyone ever inform you that regurgitating /b/ speak is about as far from funny as it gets?
[6:40] <vurtual> not /b/
[6:40] <vurtual> fp
[6:40] <PuyoDead> Same shit.
[6:40] <vurtual> not even remotely
[6:41] <PuyoDead> Same shit.
[6:41] <vurtual> and he's not the worst of 'em
[6:41] <AndrewPH> same shit
[6:41] <vurtual> if facepunch and /b/ were the same to you, I'd have to wager that you have not seen either.
[6:41] <PuyoDead> Well, to be fair, him and Quatro both have a solid *chan vocabulary. I'm not sure which one is worse.
[6:41] <vurtual> You don't act as old as you say you are.
[6:41] * vurtual glares with half-closed eyes
[6:41] <fenixfurion> Doesn't the majority of facepunch hate /b/?
[6:42] <CruelNoise> vurtual, does that mean you want to go to sleep?
[6:42] <PuyoDead> I suppose whichever manages to make an original statement first.
[6:42] <AndrewPH> fenixfurion, I depise /b/
[6:42] <CruelNoise> and who could hate /b/?
[6:42] <AndrewPH> doesn't stop me from saying what my friends say
[6:42] <vurtual> a sick monster that's what
[6:42] <CruelNoise> those people are like, my best friends second to you
[6:42] <AndrewPH> Honestly if I liked /b/ I'd constantly spew out memes
[6:42] <CruelNoise> even though they don't even know i exist
[6:42] <PuyoDead> You do.
[6:42] <AndrewPH> PuyoDead, I could have said the game 5 times in the past 10 minutes
[6:43] <LG_Legacy> Fucking infinity ward
[6:43] <SireTRM> [Random interrupt] Which is worse: NAMBLA or Scientology?
[6:43] <LG_Legacy> Crashing my games.
[6:43] <vurtual> scientology
[6:43] <PuyoDead> Doesn't mean you haven't done it about 99.997% in the past.
[6:43] <AndrewPH> PuyoDead, doesn't stop me from playing on my n64
[6:43] <CruelNoise> actually, i hate /b/ too
[6:43] <CruelNoise> it's ruined my life, even though i don't go there anymore

[6:44] <AndrewPH> PuyoDead, I'm interested to see what happens to be honest.
[6:44] <SireTRM> Trying to caption RL?
[6:44] <CruelNoise> if i hadn't ever gone to /b/, i wouldn't be here
[6:44] <PuyoDead> Yea, but then they'd have to NOT kill them. Are they capable of that?

[7:28] <LordAidan> Yar?
[7:28] <Diablodoct0r> What's the recipe to make Saddle rideable to any creature?
[7:28] <LordAidan> Cant make it
[7:28] <CruelNoise> apparently it's OH MY GOD HELP ME backwards
[7:28] <Gerald_K> nomnom
[7:28] <LordAidan> Gotta get it from ruins
[7:28] <Kodaichi> i ever tell you bout this one time my buddy keith got a pet cat?

[7:28] * Gerald_K (geraldbren@adsl-95-146-5.jan.bellsouth.net) has left #minecraft
[7:28] <LordAidan> Yep.
[7:28] <Diablodoct0r> That you can actually find it for all creatures?
[7:28] <Diablodoct0r> So there are 2 saddles?
[7:28] <Kodaichi> 3rd degree scatches over 90% of his body
[7:28] <LordAidan> Just for pigs I think
[7:28] <LordAidan> maybe sheep
[7:28] <Konogan> You can't ride everything, only pig with the saddle.
[7:28] <vurtual> saddle up maggots
[7:28] <Diablodoct0r> Yes but
[7:28] <CruelNoise> so what exactly happened to the cat in hl2?
[7:28] <Diablodoct0r> People said earlier,
[7:28] <LordAidan> But think about this..
[7:28] <LordAidan> This means...
[7:28] <Diablodoct0r> That you can craft it to make it ride all creatures.
[7:28] <LordAidan> the mobs are making pig calvary!
[7:29] <LordAidan> Why else would they horde saddles?
[7:29] <outsomnia> [20:28] <Diablodoct0r> People said earlier,

[7:37] <vurtual> someone bumping into another guy during a race
[7:37] <vurtual> except instead of being like my White Land II crash, whichw as not fun at all
[7:37] <vurtual> it'd also blow up buildings
[7:38] <vurtual> come to think of it, didn't that f-zero anime have a similar scene
[7:38] <vurtual> where... I think the blue falcon or something, knocked samurai goroh off the track

[7:40] <Merciless> Man i still cant figure out these new water physics. I'm trying to fill a pit. It's taking for fucking EVER.
[7:40] <Mosslander> it won't fill.
[7:40] <outsomnia> oh hi merc
[7:41] <Merciless> i dont like the scaling down thing
[7:41] <Mosslander> It doesn't work that way any-more.
[7:41] <Merciless> it's annoying :s
[7:41] <vurtual> place more blocks
[7:41] <vurtual> create a spring that reproduces
[7:41] <Dude> so when is notch going to fix his water
[7:41] <Merciless> i mean the current and waterfalls and all that are fine, but filling stuff is a lot harder now.
[7:42] <outsomnia> Make a lattice of solid blocks and springs at the top/mouth of the pit with one more above it in a jaunted position and then remove the solid blocks?
[7:42] <Mosslander> just remember that a empty space that has two adjacent permenent water blocks on a horazontal plane will turn into a perminent water block.
[7:42] <outsomnia> or you can just layer springs into it from bottom to top :D
[7:42] <Mosslander> it's that simple.
[7:43] * TkTech|Busy is now known as TkTech|Hiatus
[7:43] <outsomnia> Pond-making is simple, filling a pit however, welp.
[7:43] <Merciless> I don'tlava works the same way i assume?
[7:43] <outsomnia> You can't reproduce lava.
[7:43] <Mosslander> So if you do permenent water blocks arround the entire edge of a hole, it will automaticly spawn the rest.

[7:45] <vurtual> oh
[7:45] <Mosslander> just a single row of spring blocks arround the entire edge of the hole.
[7:45] <vurtual> that crash was in the melee intro
[7:45] <Merciless> thats going to take a lot of pukkits
[7:45] <outsomnia> it would just flow down the side and fill the bottom only though.
[7:46] <outsomnia> it's going to take a lot of buckets any way you do it.
[7:46] <Mosslander> You just need a four square hole with water in it next to it, for an infinite source.

[9:35] <Liam|Yiff_Pudding> Is it possible to _make_ a saddle, or do you have to find one?
[9:35] <ClassiestMedic> the shamwow guy in jail
[9:35] <ClassiestMedic> find one
[9:35] <Liam|Yiff_Pudding> Damn
[9:35] <CyborgDragon> liam, only findable
[9:35] <ClassiestMedic> no making it without NBTedit
[9:35] <CyborgDragon> also, anyone noticed a pattern in the DC movies?
[9:35] <Liam|Yiff_Pudding> I found one, but then i lost it. xD
[9:35] <CyborgDragon> The Incredible Hulk had Tony Stark cameo at the end
[9:35] <ClassiestMedic> lol
[9:35] <CyborgDragon> then came Iron Man
[9:35] <CyborgDragon> then Iron Man 2, at the end of which Captain America cameos.

[9:36] <CyborgDragon> Anyone wanna guess what the next movie will be about?
[9:36] <LordAidan> Ironman goes rogue
[9:36] <LordAidan> And kills the president
[9:36] <LordAidan> It is revealed later that this was a fake
[9:36] <CyborgDragon> not DC, Marvel*
[9:36] <LordAidan> trying to frame the real ironman

[9:36] <LordAidan> As the authorities hunt down ironman, he must avoid them
[9:36] <LordAidan> and track down the impersonator.
[9:37] <CyborgDragon> LordAidan, I was saying that the next Marvel movie would be about captain america
[9:37] <LordAidan> xD
[9:37] <LordAidan> It was just a idea :P
[9:37] <vurtual> then, in order to stop the impostor
[9:38] <vurtual> he grabs him and dives into an iron refinery
[9:38] <vurtual> like the terminator
[9:38] <CyborgDragon> palladium poisoning!
[9:38] <LordAidan> Epic.
[9:38] <vurtual> next movie, he emerges
[9:38] <vurtual> STEEL MAN
[9:39] <LordAidan> Wut.
[9:39] <vurtual> having been refined
[9:39] <vurtual> and now he's fully a cyborg
[9:39] <vurtual> wheeee, I fixed my fire stingray
[9:39] <vurtual> so now if I paste it, it stil lworks.
[9:39] <CyborgDragon> No, next iron man movie will combine the marvel iron man with the Black Sabbath iron man, where stark travels back in time to save everybody, but he and his suit merge into one being and is frozen solid, and is looked down upon as an evil for some reason, which causes him to turn evil
[9:40] <vurtual> so what should I dow ith my original fire stingray
[9:40] <CyborgDragon> CRASH EET
[9:41] <CyborgDragon> and record it crashing
[9:41] <vurtual> it'd pop back into shape
[9:41] <CyborgDragon> make it so it the welds can break upon impact
[9:41] <CyborgDragon> that is possible, isn't it?
[9:41] <vurtual> not really no
[9:41] <vurtual> not without rebuilding it
[9:41] <vurtual> and then the way it is, it'd break mid-race

[10:03] <Dezerus> Ah... I see.
[10:04] <vurtual> Unless I added some kind of system where it just falls

[10:06] <vurtual> You are no longer allowed ot talk about guns.
[10:06] <Shrub> what?
[10:06] <vurtual> I mean, the P90 isn't bad in the whole retrospect, compared to what it cuold have been.
[10:06] <vurtual> But it's not exactly useful.
[10:07] <Shrub> Well no, but it's cool.
[10:07] <vurtual> 50, hard-to-fit-in bullets that don't stop anything well.
[10:07] <Shrub> The awesome thing about the FN P90 is that it inspired the RC-P90
[10:07] <vurtual> It's pretty much delegated to the world of counter-strike, where it's capible of piercing the very-available armor and where nobody can aim

[10:14] <vurtual> you'd have them in garages in each spawn, respawning, and then you jump in one, hit the button, and it takes off and flies away, jumping onto the racetrack.
[10:14] <vurtual> hitting buttons would make it move left or right, or open up again, or go fast.

[10:15] <vurtual> glass is bulletproof, but if the racer takes enough damage(visible with a little bar), it explodes, first locking and burning and maybe killing you if you're inside, and then BOOOOOOM
[10:15] <Dezerus> Neurotoxin?
[10:16] <vurtual> because it's melting, and on fire
[10:16] <vurtual> and it'd streak forward comparitively(slower), sparking, and beeping
[10:16] <vurtual> additionally having transferred left or fallen off the track in any way would do so
[10:16] <vurtual> then you can open the canopy, and climb out and walk around, jumping between racers
[10:17] <Dezerus> Yes... But it'd also need lots of experimental tech and Neurotoxin.

[10:36] <vurtual> or as I had imagined for the not-arena, racers must catch up to a platform which has a capture point, and looks like the repair thingy. It always is level.
[10:37] <vurtual> But the racers hug the surface of the track, so if you hit a loop, you either have to be inside a car, or ontop.

[13:36] <CyborgDragon> and i hate you for making me think of it
[13:36] <CyborgDragon> male pigs have corkscrew penises
[13:36] <Demki> cyborg, notch said he will add them eventually.
[13:36] <Merciless> A HALF PIG HALF CREEPER
[13:36] <Joeslop> stupid coal
[13:36] <Merciless> CALLED A PEEPER
[13:36] <Joeslop> not being all up in my chests
[13:36] <CyborgDragon> demki i meant making me think of that fact
[13:36] <Demki> oh, you mean the ugly part.
[13:36] <Diablodoct0r> Merciless: Sheeper
[13:36] <Demki> no, I want it without that part.
[13:37] <Merciless> Sheeper *shudders*
[13:37] <CyborgDragon> i didnt suggest it as a feature demki, jeez
[13:37] <Demki> skeleton-creeper?
[13:37] <Diablodoct0r> That's a Skeeper
[13:37] <CyborgDragon> i said you made me think of that disgusting fact from real life
[13:37] <Diablodoct0r> or a skipper
[13:37] <Demki> spiper?
[13:37] <Demki> spider pig!@
[13:37] <CyborgDragon> hey guys
[13:37] <Diablodoct0r> Spig
[13:37] <CyborgDragon> trick creepers
[13:37] <Demki> SPIDER PIG!
[13:37] <Diablodoct0r> Haha
[13:37] <CyborgDragon> creepers disguised as pigs
[13:37] <Demki> cyborg, it exists already
[13:38] <Diablodoct0r> o_o
[13:38] <Diablodoct0r> my butt it does
[13:38] <Demki> I heard "oink" and found a creeper.
[13:38] <CyborgDragon> i hear grunts and find pigs
[13:38] <CyborgDragon> notch fudged up their sounds i think
[13:38] <Demki> I heard "oink", went outside to farm the pigs, and then, BOOM
[13:38] <Demki> there probably was a pig there
[13:39] <CyborgDragon> also, the creeper is a failed experiment
[13:39] <Demki> but the creeper made it to me before I made it to the pig.
[13:39] <CyborgDragon> literally
[13:39] <CyborgDragon> the model for the creeper originated from notch trying to make a pig
[13:39] <Demki> really?

[13:39] <CyborgDragon> really
[13:39] <Diablodoct0r> :D
[13:39] <Demki> =|
[13:39] <CyborgDragon> also, hi cynicalalchemist
[13:39] <CyborgDragon> im not lying, diablo
[13:39] <Joeslop> the hell
[13:39] <Demki> O-O
[13:39] <Diablodoct0r> I know
[13:39] <Joeslop> I saved my map, went and looked at the level viewer on the site
[13:40] <Diablodoct0r> it rocks right
[13:40] <Joeslop> go back into the game and suddenly there are 5 skeletons in the hall in front of me
[13:40] <Demki> (??)_(??) there is something above me.
[13:40] <Diablodoct0r> poke it
[13:40] <Diablodoct0r> maybe it roars
[13:40] <Demki> ~poke~, ahhh!
[13:40] <cynicalAlchemist> Damn my unreliable internet.
[13:40] <Demki> it was a spider!
[13:41] <Demki> infact, 5 of them.
[13:41] <Demki> ever seen 5 angry spiders fighting a skeleton?
[13:41] <Demki> I did.
[13:41] <Merciless> I've seen 4 creepers blow up about 7 skeletons
[13:41] <Merciless> it was messy
[13:41] <Merciless> found diamond from it though
[13:41] <Demki> I need a mob fight arena.
[13:42] <Demki> when MP comes out, I'll try making one.
[13:42] <Demki> with places for the audiance.
[13:42] <Demki> :D
[13:42] <Demki> of course, it will be far, and I'll try making the walls out of obsidian(it is very strong, tho explosions penetrate 1 level of it.
[13:42] <Demki> )
[13:43] <Diablodoct0r> dude
[13:43] <Demki> whaT?
[13:43] <Diablodoct0r> I keep having to re-explore my spawn point on the previewer
[13:43] <Demki> what*
[13:43] <Merciless> i need confirmation. does notch saying "adding survival mp" literally mean SURVIVAL mp...or what we actually want "infdev mp"
[13:43] <Diablodoct0r> re-buffer all the damn time
[13:43] <CyborgDragon> merciless
[13:43] <CyborgDragon> infdev IS survival
[13:43] <cynicalAlchemist> All I know is that nothing is able to reach my house/respawn point.
[13:43] <Merciless> oh right
[13:43] <Merciless> .-.
[13:43] <CyborgDragon> it will replace survival, so he means infdev survival
[13:43] <Merciless> my bad
[13:43] <Merciless> awesome then
[13:43] <Demki> merciless, infdev is survival mode.
[13:43] <Demki> =|
[13:44] <CyborgDragon> demki
[13:44] <CyborgDragon> you're late
[13:44] <Demki> what?
[13:44] <Merciless> demki yeah just tired here
[13:44] <Diablodoct0r> haha
[13:44] <Diablodoct0r> Infdev is survival
[13:44] <Diablodoct0r> <3
[13:44] <Diablodoct0r> Btw
[13:44] <Quatroking> notchheadweek should be notchheadmonth
[13:45] <Diablodoct0r> InfDev survival is still different from the normal survival
[13:45] <Quatroking> and after that month, its ezheadmonth
[13:45] <Diablodoct0r> and you bitches know it
[13:45] <Diablodoct0r> You can even eat flowers there
[13:45] <CyborgDragon> wut
[13:45] <Demki> diablo, infdev is infinite maps development.
[13:45] <Demki> it is the latest version
[13:45] <CyborgDragon> last i played survivaltest i placed a flower, not eat it
[13:45] <Diablodoct0r> I know.
[13:45] <Diablodoct0r> But it never had the eat-shroom
[13:45] <Diablodoct0r> Or many other features
[13:45] <CyborgDragon> diablo
[13:45] <Demki> the free survival test is outdated.
[13:45] <CyborgDragon> eatshroom was replaced
[13:46] <CyborgDragon> lrn2mushroomsoup
[13:46] <Diablodoct0r> >_>
[13:46] <Demki> mushroom soup is the best food atm.
[13:46] <CyborgDragon> i love mushroom soup
[13:46] * cynicalAlchemist (seridon200@CPE-124-191-147-156.iqla1.woo.bigpond.net.au) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[13:46] <Demki> but it is pretty much finite.
[13:46] <CyborgDragon> it's so weir
[13:46] <CyborgDragon> d
[13:46] <CyborgDragon> bad shroom + good shroom = ultra good soup
[13:47] <Demki> meat/wheat are both infinite food sources
[13:47] <CyborgDragon> also,i dare you to eat food while IN lava
[13:47] <Demki> wheat is the best for carrying, then shrooms, then meat.
[13:47] <Demki> meat is horrible for transporting.
[13:48] <Joeslop> wheat stacks, and you don't need a workbench to make bread, right?
[13:48] <Joeslop> or do you?
[13:48] <CyborgDragon> you do
[13:48] <Demki> you do need a workbench
[13:48] <Joeslop> but bread doesn't stack
[13:48] <Demki> but wheat does
[13:48] <Joeslop> hmm
[13:48] <Demki> so you can make it quickly.
[13:48] <Demki> and carry a lot.
[13:48] <Joeslop> I might have to actually plant things in my underground farm then
[13:48] <Demki> why not?
[13:49] <Demki> it isn't hard.
[13:49] <Joeslop> because I'm lazy
[13:49] <Joeslop> and have a ton of pig meat from those bastards spawning everywhere and getting in my way
[13:49] <Demki> meat is annoying
[13:49] <Demki> takes lots of space
[13:49] <Demki> wheat is space preserving
[13:51] <Demki> you can fill your inventory(36 spaces) with 108 wheat, which is 1.6875 stacks of 64.

[14:18] <Shrub> So if I do it will automatically withdraw cash from my bank account into my paypal?
[14:18] <Shrub> then pay with that?
[14:19] <Rithiur> Shrub: If you have the CC linked, yeah. You can also transfer funds to the paypal account first, if you want, but there isn't much point in that.
[14:19] <CyborgDragon> also guys, the pokemon yellow entry for arcanine reads " A legendary Pok??mon in China. Many people are charmed by its grace and beauty while running. "
[14:19] <CyborgDragon> arcanine is chinese!

[14:26] <sorre> u mad 'cause u rong
[14:26] <Diablodoct0r> Okay here it comes
[14:26] <CyborgDragon> ez was here!
[14:26] <Diablodoct0r> ---
[14:26] <Shadaez> I remember going and watching the first pokemon mobie
[14:26] <CyborgDragon> we missed her
[14:26] <Diablodoct0r> Arcanine's species is classified as "Legendary" in the Pok??dex, although the word is probably used in an entirely different context than with the actual Legendary Pok??mon. It is theorized, however, that Arcanine was one of the original three Legendary Pok??mon, the other two being Zapdos and Articuno.
[14:26] <Diablodoct0r> It is thought the game designers decided to make all three legendary Pok??mon birds and so they replaced Arcanine's status as the legendary fire Pok??mon with Moltres.[citation needed] They did, however, give it the label of "Legendary Pok??mon".
[14:26] <Diablodoct0r> Arcanine's sum of base stats are the highest below 580, which is the benchmark for Legendary Pok??mon like Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres.
[14:26] <Shrub> interesting
[14:26] <Diablodoct0r> And,
[14:26] <Diablodoct0r> In the Series 1 episode: "Emergency!" An image of Arcanine appears on a stone tablet of Legendary Pok??mon, alongside Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres.
[14:26] <Shrub> Thank you Diablo
[14:26] <CyborgDragon> It's a legendary, but it's not like the other legendaries
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> You're most welcome Shrub :)
[14:27] <Merciless> okay fine. FINE
[14:27] <Shrub> So, let's just say
[14:27] <Merciless> ;_;
[14:27] <Shrub> It's a FUCKING POKEMON
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> :D
[14:27] <Shrub> DEAL WITH IT.
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> hahaha
[14:27] <Merciless> i like shrubs answer
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> Well, it's probably half-legendary
[14:27] <Shrub> Imo
[14:27] <CyborgDragon> i've been telling you all to deal with it for a while, yet you kept bitching saying it wasnt
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> hahaha
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> Cyborg
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> It really isn't
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> they just didn't remove the Legendary Status
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> It was, but it ain't
[14:27] <CyborgDragon> it is a legendary according to the fucking pokedex
[14:27] <CyborgDragon> so it's a legendary
[14:27] <Shrub> Should've had Arcanine, Zapdos and some Water creature as legendaries
[14:27] <Diablodoct0r> yes
[14:28] <Diablodoct0r> But it shouldn't be
[14:28] <Diablodoct0r> Technically, it is legendary
[14:28] <Diablodoct0r> good idea shrub
[14:28] <CyborgDragon> lugia
[14:28] <sorre> technically, george w. bush should never have been president of the united states
[14:28] <Diablodoct0r> okay answer is then, it is xD
[14:28] <Merciless> if were going on base stats is suppose that piece of shit lucario is meant to be one too then
[14:28] <sorre> doesn't change the fact that he was, for eight years
[14:28] <Shadaez> wtf
[14:28] <Diablodoct0r> idk about that Merciless
[14:28] <CyborgDragon> merciless, lucario is a "pseudo-legendary"
[14:28] <Shrub> Okay guys
[14:28] <Merciless> ah, fair enough
[14:28] <Shadaez> why does my button up shirt have an extra button on the bottom that's smaller than the others
[14:29] <sorre> also, lucario is rape given form, when trained properly
[14:29] <Shadaez> i thought those were for replacements

[14:31] <CyborgDragon> hey guys

[14:32] <CyborgDragon> it's not the bottom of the map either
[14:32] <sorre> so, yeah, i grabbed an absol from my PC, taught it thief, and went to town
[14:32] <CyborgDragon> it's near the bottom
[14:32] <sorre> 45 heart scales later, i decided to call it a day
[14:32] <Sparky20> oh
[14:32] <Sparky20> so
[14:32] <Sparky20> hmm
[14:32] <Shrub> I think I might *try* Generation IV

[14:33] <sorre> also
[14:33] <sorre> dat fucking torterra
[14:33] <Shrub> pokemon should not split into the Y axis!
[14:33] <Quatroking> all pokemans after #251 are faggots

[14:33] <sorre> torterra is not a faggot
[14:33] <CyborgDragon> shrub, only two gen4s are good
[14:33] <Diablodoct0r> even ash changed
[14:33] <Shrub> All pokemons after 151 are faggots
[14:33] <Diablodoct0r> and the characters
[14:33] <CyborgDragon> heartgold and soulsilver
[14:33] <Shrub> hell even mew's a fag
[14:33] <Sparky20> ogodlava
[14:33] <Diablodoct0r> All pokemon after Pokemon gold are completely meaningless imo

[14:36] <Sparky20> like 20*20
[14:37] <CyborgDragon> in gen5 you can only go to the previous regions via boat or airplane
[14:37] <CyborgDragon> meaning it's not part of japan
[14:37] <CyborgDragon> most are thinking it's based on manhattan island, and i have to agree

[14:58] <Demki> no
[14:58] <Demki> (nothing here) = 0
[14:58] <Demki> 0=1
[14:58] <CyborgDragon> yes, in the mathematic sense demki it is
[14:58] <CyborgDragon> however if you use tally marks instead
[14:58] <Demki> every extra symbol is +1
[14:58] <CyborgDragon> then no

[14:59] <CyborgDragon> i talked to three math professors about this

[14:59] <CyborgDragon> using 0s, one 0 is equal to 0
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> using tallies, nothing there is equal to 0

[15:02] <CyborgDragon> 0x being the offset
[15:02] <copyboy> could you please use * instead of x?
[15:02] <Demki> I can.
[15:02] <CyborgDragon> copyboy, 0x is used for offsets in hexedecimal editors
[15:02] <copyboy> that's why
[15:02] <CyborgDragon> which is what he was referencing with that equation
[15:02] <petern> offsets?
[15:03] <copyboy> no wait ... what?
[15:03] <Demki> 0b is used for binary
[15:03] <Roadcrosser> ugh my fingers are numb from playing infdev
[15:03] <CyborgDragon> 0x12=18
[15:03] <CyborgDragon> it's a hexadecimal with a 0 offset
[15:03] <Roadcrosser> especially my left hand's 2nd to 4th finger
[15:03] <Demki> cyborg, for me, 0x just says it is hexadecimal
[15:03] <copyboy> 0x12 == 18
[15:03] <copyboy> and the magic's destroyed
[15:03] <petern> no offsets involved, it's a 0x, then the hexadecimal...

[15:04] <CyborgDragon> the offsets are used so you can go above 255 without having to use more than two characters
[15:05] <petern> CyborgDragon, oh, maybe you're talking about some specific implementation. it's not a standard hexadecimal representation.
[15:05] <Demki> like, 5xFF=?

[15:06] <petern> (and some BASICs use a suffix of h or a prefix of &)
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> or maybe im confusing myself
[15:06] <Demki> I'd stick to 0x.
[15:06] <copyboy> where x = multiplication , CyborgDragon
[15:06] <copyboy> ?*
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> yeah, my bad
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> normally i use *
[15:06] <petern> that'll be 5 ?? 0xFF
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> but i didnt for some reason
[15:06] <Demki> wait, for octal, it is 0o, right?
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> i think 5xFF=256*5-1, right?
[15:07] <petern> octal is usually just a 0 prefix on its own
[15:07] <copyboy> and 0xFF == 256*0 - 1, so -1?
[15:07] <CyborgDragon> owait, my bad
[15:07] <CyborgDragon> 5xFF=256*6-1

[15:28] * rcfighter (rcfighter@c-69-138-73-173.hsd1.md.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[15:28] <bildramer> what should be on it etc.?
[15:28] <copyboy> i have no idea, i've thought of ..
[15:28] * bildramer thinks of the MC quiver item
[15:29] <bildramer> or a bucket with other items inside
[15:29] <bildramer> or a chesst
[15:29] <bildramer> chest*
[15:29] <bildramer> or a minecart
[15:29] <copyboy> some tool, probably an diamond pickaxe and the character for infinitive on it
[15:29] <Sparky20> can you put tracks on glass?
[15:29] <bildramer> k
[15:29] <CyborgDragon> copyboy, a golden apple?
[15:29] <copyboy> yeah that's cool too
[15:29] <CyborgDragon> no sparky
[15:29] <bildramer> lol
[15:29] <copyboy> minecart full of items :3
[15:29] <CyborgDragon> you cant put tracks, ladders, or torches on glass
[15:29] <copyboy> if you can do it
[15:29] <copyboy> or ... an diamond apple :>
[15:30] <Demki> you can put ladders on fast graphics leaves
[15:30] <Demki> but not on fancy ones
[15:30] <Demki> that's weird
[15:31] <CyborgDragon> demki
[15:31] <copyboy> i wonder why
[15:31] <CyborgDragon> it's how notch renders transparent objects
[15:31] <CyborgDragon> transparent objects actually kind of count as air
[15:31] <CyborgDragon> if you have water flow onto glass
[15:31] <CyborgDragon> it starts pushing down as if it were a waterfall
[15:31] <CyborgDragon> however if it flowed onto a normal solid wall
[15:31] <CyborgDragon> it wouldnt
[15:32] <CyborgDragon> fancy leaves do the same thing too
[15:32] <copyboy> pushing down what?
[15:32] <CyborgDragon> as in it starts flowing down
[15:32] <Demki> if you put a block of dirt on the highest level of a 2 block high or more pool of water
[15:32] <CyborgDragon> thus pulling any entities caught in it down
[15:32] <Demki> water will push towards the block, why?
[15:32] <CyborgDragon> i know, it's weird
[15:32] <CyborgDragon> but it wont push down
[15:32] <CyborgDragon> if you put glass there
[15:32] <copyboy> so it won't destroy the glass?
[15:32] <CyborgDragon> it'll push down
[15:33] <CyborgDragon> however notch coded transparent items is wacky
[15:33] <CyborgDragon> to other blocks they register as air
[15:33] <Demki> I wonder if notch will make sand/gravel float in water
[15:33] <sppt> so uh
[15:33] <CyborgDragon> demki, sand/gravel dont float
[15:33] <copyboy> he'll fix it soon i guess
[15:33] <Demki> cyborg, I know
[15:33] <sppt> why is it that whenever notch posts something, the first replies are always nesting as far to the right as possible...
[15:33] <CyborgDragon> however, waves disturbing sand/gravel would be nice

[15:34] <Demki> and cyborg, dunno
[15:34] <CyborgDragon> and i am wondering why you wonder why he would do something he 99% chance wont do
[15:34] <Demki> maybe in water they will fall slower
[15:34] <CyborgDragon> falling slower would be nice
[15:34] <CyborgDragon> and realistic
[15:35] <Demki> wait, does falling sand block anything?

[15:35] <Demki> oh
[15:35] <Demki> well

[21:10] <gdude2002> He doesn't.
[21:10] <Drakkar> this is true

[21:10] <gdude2002> I haven't seen it

[22:15] <MJM777> The awesome part is where the pig takes you into the ocean. Forever.
[22:15] <Crix> You're deceiving ALL of these people!
[22:15] <Crix> They want pancake MIX!
[22:15] <vede> Animator, yeah.
[22:15] <Crix> There's no pancake mix in there
[22:16] <vede> Are you angry because I said that riding pigs wasn't confirmed, even though it eventually ended up happening?

[22:19] <bildramer> weird, you don't have the retardese-speaking symptom
[22:19] <Uncreative_> Is the Minecraft forums being down related to Minecraft's website being down?
[22:19] <Uncreative_> o-o
[22:19] <Crix> Yes. I am truly intelligent, yet now think in memes
[22:20] <MJM777> So, I'm curious... Am I the only one, who, when playing in infdev, feels the need to fill my dug out areas with uniformly colored stone whilst digging out a mine? Otherwise, I feel like my mine looks dirty.
[22:20] <SireTRM> Yea
[22:20] <Dude> yes you are
[22:20] <Uncreative_> o_o
[22:20] <MJM777> hmm...
[22:20] <SireTRM> I haven't started filling in the ore holes because I don't want to smelt my cobblestone.
[22:21] <Uncreative_> Usually I just go through and mine anything and never fill it up..
[22:21] <MJM777> good call

[22:21] <Crix> At ONE point... there was a glitch where if you refilled the ore areas with smooth stone, when you saved/releoaded the game, it would turn the smooth stone BACK INTO THE ORE
[22:21] <Crix> It was so friggan cool
[22:21] <MJM777> I can't seem to help it. Only when strip mining after digging a straight ladder shaft though.
[22:21] * Mithril` is now known as Mithril
[22:21] <Uncreative_> Sounds like a fun glitch

[22:27] <MJM777> I just tried the forums, I got the standard "Rent Our Site" instead of the forums. They were working a half hour ago. For what its worth.....
[22:27] <Drakkar> well i'm uninterested in the forums in their entirety
[22:28] <Uncreative_> I can ping it perfectly fine, and the IP address it pings is: 208.73.210.50
[22:28] <Uncreative_> I'm not sure if 208.73.210.50 is the forums or not
[22:28] <Dude> well
[22:28] <AndrewPH> I only go there for ARP
[22:28] <Dude> when i ping the forums i get 95.172.25.122

[22:30] <Awoken> The problem is when he tried to make a downloadable clinet says the blog. He broke it.

[22:30] <rcfighter> First the main site, now the forums. I can only hope the next event is the forums somehow being integrated in the main site.
[22:30] <Uncreative_> I don't see how posting it on 4chan would help anyways, AndrewPH

[22:33] <underd0g> Pushing!
[22:33] <Uncreative_> Well
[22:33] <gdude2002|away> not pushing.
[22:33] <Uncreative_> There's that "infinite track" thing that people invented
[22:33] <Uncreative_> someone said that it could bring carts uphill, too
[22:33] <Dude> infinite track what
[22:33] <Crix> infinite?
[22:33] <Crix> nowait
[22:33] <Uncreative_> well

[22:33] <underd0g> I'm gonna hire someone to follow me around. Like that lil' chinese kid in Indiana Jones. He knows how to handle mine carts
[22:33] <XenonMan> Ohey underd0g.
[22:33] <underd0g> Hey Xenon
[22:33] <Crix> oh where they just fill it with carts?
[22:33] <MJM777> So, anyways, I just bought Minecraft on Saturday, and I'm really enjoying it. It appeals to the Lego-sense I had as a kid. I'm curious how many "regulars" are here atm? Please tell me I'm not the only one hooked like a fish here.
[22:33] <Uncreative_> They created a method of having tracks make carts go infinitely
[22:33] <XenonMan> :D Sup man
[22:33] <Uncreative_> no, not when you fill it with carts
[22:33] <Miclee> I am a regular.
[22:34] <underd0g> MJM777, are you new to the game or have you been playing for free for a long time?
[22:34] <Uncreative_> I'd say "go on the forums and search for infinite rollercoaster"

[22:38] <MJM777> As far as I can tell, the community for this game is stronger than most indie games I've invested in lately. Its actually pretty awesome. And Notch is insane as far as updates and such. I mean, hell, I'm used to DF length updates. ;) (Love DF, no hatin here.)
[22:38] <LG_Legacy> Survival? You mean SMP or Survival Indev or whatever?
[22:39] <Uncreative_> ..We must get Notch to help with the forums problem!
[22:39] <LG_Legacy> MJM777 Stay away from the forumns

[23:09] <TehFluff> that one photograph spread like a virus ;-;
[23:09] <Perry> whoa
[23:09] <MJM777> So I assume someone already walked for miles to the edge of the infdev map like I did? (with torches to show where I was) and figured out you get knockback like in indev?
[23:09] <Perry> notch lives in stockholm, right?
[23:09] <TehFluff> AWMG Is he the Ghost Rider guy from Stockholm? o_O
[23:09] <MJM777> once approaching the edge of the map i mean
[23:09] <vede> There's another photograph of half of his face, from the front, but that was from Back In The Day on this channel, so no one but oldbies know about it.
[23:10] <vede> Yeah, Perry.
[23:10] <Snowman> There is also one from some other blog
[23:10] <Perry> because if so, Either there are two Markus Persson in stockholm, or I found notch's myspace and have a legit pic of notch naked in a bath
