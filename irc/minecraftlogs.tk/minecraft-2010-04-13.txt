[0:00] <Yourself> ping was packet 0x01, right?
[0:00] <Adam01> yes
[0:00] <Yourself> you'd think i'd remember this from writing the wiki article
[0:00] <Serow> It should just fall apart with the explosion noise, and be full of candy.
[0:00] <vurtual> candy candy candy candy candy

[0:03] <bildramer> ohai
[0:03] <bildramer> didn't you do the triangluation stuff
[0:03] <bildramer> also, Notch said it was pretty close
[0:03] <cryzed> Yourself, shut it
[0:04] <cryzed> *rage*
[0:04] <Yourself> what?
[0:04] <Yourself> that's really what it is
[0:04] <Kokopure> "close" my butt
[0:04] <Kokopure> I think he lives there
[0:04] <Yourself> i checked my packet sniff dumps from wire shark
[0:05] <Kokopure> of course I doubt he'd come out and say "you got it!"
[0:05] <Yourself> the pings from the server are spaced by half of a second
[0:05] <Animator> http://www.livestream.com/animatius Streaming Minecraft now and testing stream simultanouesly. Comments suggested.

[0:06] <bildramer> -"Why do some people sleep like the dead and others can be woken up by the slightest thing? My mother wakes when you poke your head into her room, and yet you need to practically kick my cousin in the balls to get him up."
[0:06] <bildramer> -"Evolutionary response. The people who wake up when someone drops a pin are the ones who could wake up before a predator can get to them. The ones who don't will get eaten."
[0:06] <bildramer> -"Exactly, and it is your duty to help your species and eat the ones who don't."
[0:07] <Yourself> k...
[0:07] <LuciferZ> I hate when people don't seem to understand that you hate them
[0:07] <LuciferZ> Like, they keep wanting to 'make up' and it's like, no dammit, I fucking hate you

[0:11] <Animator> Hey LuciferZ.
[0:11] <Yourself> there's also coffee, because apparently all of science is fueled by coffee
[0:12] <Yourself> if someone took away the coffee, science would stop
[0:12] <LuciferZ> Heya
[0:13] <Yourself> bah, what is with these new versions of firefox routinely forgetting websites that i visit every damn day?
[0:14] <Yourself> i've been visiting the bus schedule website every weekday for 4 years, why does it suddenly disappear from the drop down bar?
[0:15] * NateTheGreat (Nate@RH-CypressS-CS2-138-162.njit.edu) has joined #minecraft
[0:15] <LuciferZ> Chrome does the same fucking thing
[0:15] <LuciferZ> It's great at suggestions about 90% of the time but there's some sites it just refuses to put on top.
[0:16] <Yourself> as of friday, the bus site was on top when i typed "stop"
[0:16] <Yourself> i type "stop" today and get nothing
[0:16] <Yourself> but since i've been hitting the key combination "stop<down arrow><enter>" regularly for 4 years, i didn't look
[0:16] <Yourself> and instead got google searching for the word "stop"
[0:17] <Yourself> which is now the top result when i type stop
[0:17] <LuciferZ> Oh hey, guys, I came up with a new block type that might be cool.
[0:17] <Yourself> poop?
[0:17] <LuciferZ> Ooooo
[0:17] <LuciferZ> I'll write that down
[0:17] <LuciferZ> But no, I was thinking some sort of stone, for now I'll call it masonry
[0:18] <Malikat> so uh
[0:18] <Malikat> stone
[0:18] <LuciferZ> Like a brick pattern, enlarged, natural stone color
[0:18] <Malikat> so like sandstone
[0:18] * Marach is now known as Marafk
[0:18] <Marafk> sleeping.
[0:18] <LuciferZ> It doesn't look like piss like cobblstone does
[0:18] <Malikat> like classic UO sandstone

[0:22] * Varriount_ (mudkipz@pool-96-231-133-237.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:22] <LuciferZ> You craft it by making a 2x2 square of stone, and you get two of these blocks in return
[0:22] <LuciferZ> It takes much longer to mine than regular stone or cobblestone
[0:22] <Malikat> so like actual stone
[0:22] <Malikat> but in bricks
[0:22] <Malikat> instead of cobbles
[0:22] <LuciferZ> Exactly!
[0:22] <LuciferZ> And not fugly
[0:22] <Serow> I like the idea of bricks.
[0:23] <LuciferZ> It would be useful for castles
[0:23] <LuciferZ> Actual fortifications
[0:23] <Malarkey> dont like making castles out of pebbles?
[0:23] <LuciferZ> I HATE making castles out of cobblstone
[0:23] <Serow> Seems like it would need to be crafted from smooth stone, which adds some depth to crafting as well...
[0:23] * outsomnia (wahaha@69.233.226.178) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[0:23] <LuciferZ> I thought about that as well
[0:24] <LuciferZ> But it seems too expensive
[0:24] <Malikat> negative
[0:24] <LuciferZ> Maybe if it were extremely tough
[0:24] <Malikat> seems like a good trade for strength
[0:24] <Serow> Nah, using good masonry like that, strikes me as something you'd set up a tree farm and a big furnace factory for.
[0:24] <Malikat> ^
[0:25] <LuciferZ> I'm glad you guys actually agree, lol
[0:25] <bildramer> wtf is ookie cookie
[0:25] <LuciferZ> I didn't think anyone would share that view
[0:25] <bildramer> not going to google this
[0:25] <LuciferZ> Then I guess you are fucked, bildramer
[0:25] <Malikat> Ew.
[0:25] <Malikat> "Soggy biscuit or limp biscuit, or ""ookie cookie"" is a male masturbation game reportedly played in typically teenage male-oriented groups in which the participants stand around a biscuit masturbating until ejaculating onto it; the last person to do so must eat the biscuit. The term is thought to have originated in Australia sometime in the 1960s.Although the terminology may differ slightly, the notability of the game is such that va
[0:26] <Malikat> quoted from the quick definition trillian gave me
[0:26] <LuciferZ> How the hell
[0:26] <bildramer> ...
[0:26] <bildramer> D:
[0:26] <LuciferZ> This is why gay people can't have nice things
[0:26] <Yourself> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ookie_cookie
[0:26] <Yourself> wikipedia never fails
[0:26] <bildramer> lol
[0:26] <bildramer> sad, sad
[0:26] <rbos> WHAT HAS BEEN SEEN CANNOT BE UNSEEN
[0:27] * rbos flails.
[0:27] <Serow> It's totally a 'straight' guy thing, LuciferZ.
[0:27] <Malikat> yeah
[0:27] <Drewseph> uh
[0:27] <Malikat> that's a straight guy thing
[0:27] <Drewseph> what the fuck kinda person made this up
[0:27] <LuciferZ> No
[0:27] <Malikat> where they're like ROFL SUCKS TO LOSE
[0:27] <Serow> People wanting to break in new frat members. XD
[0:27] <LuciferZ> They might saaaay they're straight
[0:27] <Drewseph> What kind of Teenag male wants to jack off in a sausage fest?
[0:27] <Malikat> but i don't think guys actually do that
[0:27] <Drewseph> alone sure, but in a group
[0:27] <Drewseph> you can't get more gay than that
[0:27] <LuciferZ> But if they find it fun to make other men eat their jizz, they are gay
[0:27] <Drewseph> and don't teens fear gay things?
[0:27] <Serow> Sure you can. You can be the guy who loses on purpose. XD
[0:28] <Yourself> Drewseph: if they were actually touching one another, that would be "more gay"
[0:28] <Drewseph> that just fucking disturbing
[0:28] <Drewseph> I was a teen once
[0:28] <Malikat> it's supposed to be funny
[0:28] * Rooster (chatzilla@pool-74-111-197-38.lsanca.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:28] <LuciferZ> "More gay" because it is already "Super fucking gay"
[0:28] <Yourself> not to mention that if they were gay, the one who ate the cookie would be the winner, not the loser, don't you think?
[0:28] <Malikat> like the way some jocks think that teabagging the guy who passes out at a party is funny
[0:28] <Drewseph> and I NEVER EVER wanted my dick anywhere near the presense in the open with another dude
[0:28] <Rooster> lolwut
[0:28] <Drewseph> locker rooms were a no go zone for me
[0:28] <Rooster> rofl
[0:29] <Drewseph> not cause I'm a phobe
[0:29] <Drewseph> but justc ause I knew I wasn't gay and didn't want to see sausage

[0:29] <LuciferZ> You guys are looking at this from the wrong perspective. There is no 'loser' in this game, because seriosly
[0:29] <polabear> hey
[0:29] <Malikat> i didn't want to pull it out because it's the only black part of me

[0:30] <bildramer> Also, Drewseph, still 14, same
[0:30] <Serow> I think it's funny that the guy cursed with premature ejaculation is the guy that wins at that game, too.
[0:30] <bildramer> wtf with homosexuality
[0:30] <bildramer> lol Serow
[0:30] <Yourself> as much as i enjoy seeing homophobes talk about how gay something is, i need to go to this seminar
[0:30] <Yourself> and the bus leaves in 10 minutes
[0:30] <bildramer> you have time
[0:30] <Yourself> no, i don't
[0:30] <polabear> http://www.minecraft.net/play.jsp?server=fec3a9ac6662ab5fc5d3e9ac28a55f19 but srsly i made the parthenon here
[0:30] <Yourself> i have to drive to the bus stop
[0:30] <Malikat> Serow: at least the guy with premature ejaculation will never get fired for being late :3

[0:32] <LuciferZ> I love D&D. Never played it though, because I have videogames
[0:32] <Malikat> oh man
[0:33] <Serow> I enjoy it a lot more than video games, but video games are much easier to make time for.

[0:34] <LuciferZ> Yeah, that's my main problem.

[0:36] <Malikat> screenshots, size stats, accuracy, how much work have you put in
[0:37] <Malikat> you could be talking about a 3x3x3 reproduction of it
[0:37] <LuciferZ> Or a 256 cubed re-imagining that would make Travian cry from joy.
[0:38] <LuciferZ> Oh wait, I was thinking Pantheon
[0:39] <Malikat> 768x768x768 that would make me jizz in my pants
[0:39] <LuciferZ> I don't know who built the Parthenon
[0:39] <Malikat> greeks
[0:39] <Malikat> temple of athena
[0:40] <LuciferZ> Well, I know greeks
[0:40] <LuciferZ> Pantheon says right on it which emperor commissioned it, even though it's wrong.

[0:41] <Kokopure> when Indev goes multiplayer
[0:41] <LuciferZ> Kokpure, yes
[0:41] <Kokopure> people will start making towns
[0:42] <polabear> did someone say my name
[0:42] <Kokopure> ... but unless you're playing on an infinite level
[0:42] <Kokopure> you'll run out of materials. there's only so much stone.
[0:42] <Malikat> yes, i did
[0:42] <Malikat> you fool
[0:42] <LuciferZ> Kokpure
[0:42] <Kokopure> to make a really tall building, you need a lot of stone.
[0:42] <polabear> wat is it
[0:42] <Malikat> scroll up and see
[0:42] <LuciferZ> Kokopure rather

[0:43] <polabear> oh
[0:43] <LuciferZ> That was pretty much what made infinite maps
[0:43] <LuciferZ> Everybody was like "What'll we do about resource loss?"
[0:43] <Kokopure> right, and what was the answer to that?
[0:43] <LuciferZ> And notch was like "Hur dur 8 times the size of the earth"
[0:43] <T> Infinite levels.
[0:43] <Malikat> i had the answer
[0:43] <LuciferZ> And we were like "w00t"
[0:43] <Kokopure> right, LuciferZ
[0:43] <Kokopure> so they will be infinite levels?
[0:43] <polabear> honestly im to lazy to measure it
[0:43] <LuciferZ> There will be massive levels, yes
[0:43] <T> Well they're not really infinite, they're just procedural and very large.
[0:43] <LuciferZ> Multiplayer will have definable limits.
[0:44] <LuciferZ> So you could make like, Rhode Island if you wanted.

[0:44] <polabear> and about 17 high
[0:44] <Kokopure> but what happens when the size of your town becomes so big as to take a -really- long time to get out of it?
[0:44] <polabear> i posted it on forums
[0:44] <Kokopure> I mean, you can't walk very fast
[0:44] <LuciferZ> Then...
[0:45] <LuciferZ> I dunno, you get the fuck over it
[0:45] <Kokopure> haha
[0:45] <T> You wouldn't make towns that big.
[0:45] <LuciferZ> There might be mounts or carts later
[0:45] <Kokopure> you wouldn't?
[0:45] <Kokopure> I might
[0:45] <polabear> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=11540
[0:45] <T> Well then that would be your fault.
[0:45] <LuciferZ> I would. But if you built something that big
[0:45] <polabear> theres a screen
[0:45] <LuciferZ> Why bother leaving it?
[0:45] <LuciferZ> Pay other people to mine.
[0:45] <Kokopure> here comes the barter system...
[0:45] <Kokopure> I would keep a bunch of pigs on top of my tower
[0:45] <Kokopure> and every so often
[0:46] <Kokopure> push some off onto the townsfolk.
[0:46] <LuciferZ> No system beyond the ability to pass resources between players
[0:46] <Kokopure> of cours.e
[0:46] <Kokopure> I don't want currency
[0:46] <LuciferZ> I'd be okay with currency so long as we don't have to use it.
[0:46] <LuciferZ> I might want to buy things with coins at some point.
[0:47] <LuciferZ> But probably not until I've got a trade empire set up.
[0:47] <polabear> well

[0:50] <Chezhead> What are you guys talking about?
[0:51] <Chezhead> String as a weapon?
[0:51] <Kokopure> Lucifer is going to bring the long arm of the law down on me
[0:51] <Kokopure> for daring to ridicule his future empire
[0:51] <LuciferZ> I'm talking about having Kokopure publicly flogged for loling at my trade empire
[0:51] <Kokopure> his trade empire that doesn't even exist yet
[0:51] <LuciferZ> DOES TOO D:

[0:54] <Kokopure> maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot for daring to say this
[0:54] <Kokopure> but as long as you don't build your house out of dirt, I think griefing will not be a super glaring problem.
[0:54] <rbos> i agree
[0:54] <vurtual> wood=axe
[0:54] <vurtual> stone=pick
[0:54] <Kokopure> even with a pickaxe, stone takes a -while- to break down.
[0:54] <vurtual> either way, down
[0:54] <Kokopure> yes
[0:55] <Kokopure> it does
[0:55] <rbos> that said, there will probably be both pvp and pve servers

[0:55] <vurtual> and arrows arrows arrows arrows
[0:55] <Kokopure> so what about arrows?
[0:55] <Kokopure> do you know how hard arrows are to make?
[0:55] <vurtual> helms deep
[0:55] <Kokopure> you'd have to kill so many skeletons
[0:55] <LuciferZ> Griefing won't be destruction
[0:55] <vurtual> pull a helms deep
[0:55] <Kokopure> or mine for IRON
[0:55] <vurtual> helms deep.
[0:55] <Rooster> Oh jesus still on that Multiplayer?
[0:55] <LuciferZ> It will be murder and theft.
[0:55] <Kokopure> and even then you still have to smelt it
[0:55] <vurtual> the point is that you use arrows to KEEP AWAY griefers
[0:55] <vurtual> So griefing IS a problem?
[0:55] <Kokopure> I wouldn't carry all my shit around with me
[0:55] <rbos> the only thing I'd be worried about would be people flooding my stuff with water while I'm afk

[0:58] <Kokopure> yeah, I guess that's true
[0:58] <bildramer> that's what she said
[0:58] <Kokopure> look at the trees next to it
[0:58] <rbos> you'd need a pretty big map, at least a couple thousand blocks to a side
[0:58] <LuciferZ> The outside walls look about ten or so high
[0:58] <Kokopure> the trees seem taller than the front arches
[0:59] <vurtual> trees irl are big
[0:59] <Kokopure> it'd be pretty darn awesome though
[0:59] <LuciferZ> It would be interesting though... To take a picture of a building and photoshop it to look like a minecraft building.
[0:59] <Kokopure> to light yourself on fire
[0:59] <Kokopure> and then jump off the front
[0:59] <Kokopure> :D
[0:59] <LuciferZ> Yeah, lol
[0:59] <Kokopure> haha, is someone going to make a photoshop minecraft filter?

[1:37] <Luingar> fine, lemme rephrase it

[1:44] <Quatroking> who spammed the IRC and did shit and stuff
[1:44] <Subculture> I'd like to discuss it with you gents.
[1:45] <vurtual> so guys what am I supposed to do to fill up my extreme need for space fightery games?
[1:45] <LuciferZ> Sure, throw them out there, Subculture
[1:46] <LuciferZ> Play rogue squadron for N64, Vurtual
[1:46] <Subculture> Vurtual
[1:46] <Subculture> Play X3 Reunion
[1:46] <Subculture> Amazing game.
[1:46] <Subculture> BIIIG learning curve though
[1:46] <Subculture> It's one of those games you have to study.
[1:46] <Subculture> But once you figure it out, it's amazing.
[1:46] <Subculture> ANYWAYS
[1:47] <vurtual> Z, if I wanted to play rogue squadron
[1:47] <Luingar> i are lonely
[1:47] <vurtual> I'd put this disc in, and play it
[1:47] <Subculture> I had an idea about pigments, our options for decoration are incredibly limited. You get gray stone, gray cobblestone, gray cloth, gray iron, or wood. You can forget trying to make anything cool with gold or diamond.
[1:48] <vurtual> also x3 reunion costs like, 10 bucks.
[1:48] <Subculture> It's worth it.
[1:48] * chac (chatzilla@ip56582c0f.direct-adsl.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[1:48] <Subculture> It's one of those games you never stop playing.
[1:48] <vurtual> no no it's not the price, it's the spending money
[1:48] <Subculture> Ever.
[1:48] <Subculture> You just take breaks.
[1:48] <Subculture> So download it.
[1:48] <vurtual> I just bought JC2
[1:48] <vurtual> so I'm not gonna go outright and get another game yet
[1:49] <vurtual> hmm
[1:49] <vurtual> There's that HL2 mod Eternal Silence that I installed, but the ships there suck
[1:49] <Subculture> X3 Terran Conflict is good.
[1:49] <Subculture> Anyways, back to my idea.
[1:49] <Subculture> The flowers don't have a use, so perhaps we could craft flowers and cloth together
[1:49] <Subculture> Say
[1:49] <Subculture> One Red Flower and one Cloth = Pink Cloth
[1:49] <Subculture> or
[1:49] <Subculture> Two Red Flowers and one Cloth = Red Cloth
[1:49] * Kokopure is now known as Koko|fewd

[1:50] <Subculture> More flowers would have to be added ofcourse.
[1:50] <Subculture> Eternal silence is shit.
[1:50] <Koko|fewd> I think you should be able to craft a flower and water into dye.
[1:50] <Subculture> It's a terrible mod that has no clue regarding aesthetic appeal.
[1:50] * Darke (Darkebrz@71-13-57-154.dhcp.bycy.mi.charter.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[1:50] <Koko|fewd> you should be able to carry water once you get a bowl
[1:50] <Subculture> You mean a bucket?
[1:50] <Koko|fewd> right, bucket
[1:50] <Koko|fewd> bowls already exist though :|
[1:51] <Koko|fewd> they're just only for mushroom soup.
[1:51] <Subculture> I tried to imagine myself filling up an irrigation system with tiny cereal bowls
[1:51] <vurtual> using a small cereal spoon
[1:51] <Subculture> Yes!
[1:51] <Koko|fewd> "breakfast time, plants!"
[1:51] <vurtual> slowly, spoon by spoon, adding water to the dry ditch
[1:51] <Luingar> ...
[1:51] <Luingar> your mind is a strange place
[1:51] * Luingar moves in
[1:51] <Koko|fewd> our fields are a stranger place
[1:51] <vurtual> enthusiastically and caringly staring down while you, spoon by spoon, add more water
[1:51] <Koko|fewd> anyway I'm off to go eat
[1:52] <Subculture> It takes so long that you're surrounded by skeleton corpses by the time the bowl is empty
[1:52] <Koko|fewd> if Notch comes around (ha!) give him my regards
[1:52] <vurtual> until the bowl is empty, and then you shake it dry somewhere else, and spoon more water in from a water source.
[1:52] <Koko|fewd> and my underwater helmet idea :3
[1:52] <Subculture> Underwater helmet.
[1:52] <Subculture> That'd be awesome.
[1:52] <Koko|fewd> http://www.divingmuseum.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/product_images/icebuckethelmet.jpg <-- I mean one of these.
[1:53] <Luingar> old school eh?
[1:53] <Subculture> I'd like to be able to hold my breath for more than 20 seconds.
[1:53] <Subculture> Some flippers would be cool, for extra fast swimming
[1:53] <Koko|fewd> for longer time underwater
[1:53] <Koko|fewd> I think it'd fit!
[1:53] <Koko|fewd> plus it'd be easy to craft.
[1:53] <Subculture> This game reminds me of Klonk Rage

[2:01] <Subculture> Oh, that's right.
[2:01] <Subculture> I remember now.
[2:01] <Luingar> penis WITH PENIS INSIDE
[2:02] <Subculture> It's NEVER FUNNY AND YOU SUCK AT COMEDY.
[2:02] <Luingar> ...
[2:02] <Luingar> blow me
[2:02] * outsomnia (wahaha@69.233.226.178) has joined #minecraft
[2:02] <Luingar> i do this for my amusement, not yours
[2:02] <Luingar> also, penis
[2:02] <vurtual> (>_)_)> It's like a person, but backwards.
[2:02] <KodaichiZero> SO
[2:02] <vurtual> At laest it's funnier than Luingar... maybe.
[2:02] <KodaichiZero> I'm trying to modify L4D2
[2:02] <Luingar> uh.
[2:03] <Luingar> don't do that
[2:03] <KodaichiZero> I've already edited the vtfs for the helicopters so they look like chocolate
[2:03] <Luingar> ..
[2:03] <Luingar> @_@
[2:03] <Luingar> i take back what i said earlier
[2:03] <vurtual> KodaichiZero, change the particles to a massive river of chocolate
[2:03] <Luingar> continue
[2:03] <KodaichiZero> I don't know how to apply them in-game though
[2:03] <vurtual> Actually if portal 2 has ah elicopter
[2:03] <Luingar> i will donate money if you continue more
[2:03] <vurtual> It should have all sorts of nice effects
[2:03] <Subculture> You replace the original textures with the ones you amde.
[2:03] <Subculture> So just rename the new files as the original
[2:04] <KodaichiZero> it's not that easy
[2:04] <Subculture> Make sure to backup the original texture files.
[2:04] <vurtual> yes it is actually KodaichiZero
[2:04] <Subculture> FUCK YOU YES IT IS
[2:04] <Luingar> as soon as you publish a working thing to the public, i shall ghive you money
[2:04] * Brett (brettr@CPE00226b838ab8-CM00159a0251c4.cpe.net.cable.rogers.com) has joined #minecraft
[2:04] <vurtual> you don't even replace them Subculture
[2:04] <KodaichiZero> ?
[2:04] <vurtual> you just put them in folders
[2:04] <KodaichiZero> okay I'll try
[2:04] <Subculture> Bah
[2:04] <vurtual> chocolate helicopter is an old thing Luingar
[2:04] <vurtual> lots of people did it
[2:04] <Subculture> I'm used to modding for Oblivion and S.T.A.L.K.E.R
[2:04] <Subculture> S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a bitch to mod.
[2:05] <vurtual> so anyways if portal 2 has a helicopter it had better have detailed moving parts in the animation, multiple suond sources for the best 3D sound, and tiniest bits of exhaust wherever it might be.
[2:05] <Subculture> I don't get it, what's the significance of a chocolate helicopter?
[2:05] <Luingar> ...
[2:05] <vurtual> then if you were to say, change the exhaustyness to FIRE, you could have a flaming rocket engine.
[2:05] <Luingar> in the beginning video
[2:05] <vurtual> Subculture watch the beginning
[2:05] <Luingar> nick tells coach
[2:05] <Luingar> "maybe the chopper is made of chocolate"
[2:05] <Subculture> lmfao
[2:05] <Subculture> Oh I get it
[2:05] <Luingar> cause their going up those stairs
[2:05] <Subculture> I remember that
[2:05] <Brett> the source engine does fire really poorly :p
[2:05] <Luingar> and coach is slow 'cause he's fat
[2:05] <Luingar> yeah
[2:05] <Luingar> lol
[2:05] <vurtual> Brett, ob engine
[2:06] <Subculture> give it a break Brett, the source engine is probably the easiest engines to work with... period
[2:06] <Luingar> replace spitter acid with SEMEN
[2:06] <Subculture> WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND PENIS?
[2:06] <Luingar> or cherry coke
[2:06] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-8NSjJ7Fq4 this should be it
[2:06] <Subculture> WHY IS THIS SO FUNNY TO YOU
[2:06] <Subculture> I DONT UNDERSTAND
[2:06] <Luingar> it's not
[2:06] <vurtual> replace it with water
[2:06] <Brett> i know, i know, i wasn't ragging on it
[2:06] <Brett> just an observation
[2:06] <vurtual> like, turn the particles into water
[2:06] <Luingar> it's your reaction
[2:06] <vurtual> anyways l4d2 sucks
[2:06] <Subculture> WHY ARE MALE GENITALS INHERINTLY FUNNY TO 13 YEAR OLDS?
[2:07] * Luingar eyestabs vurtual
[2:07] <vurtual> Left 4 Dead had better music and sound.
[2:07] * Luingar is 18
[2:07] <vurtual> there wasn't like 50 identical guns
[2:07] <Brett> lol, male genitals
[2:07] <Luingar> almost 19 actually
[2:07] <vurtual> So here's your choice guys
[2:07] <Luingar> *facepalms, snickering
[2:07] <vurtual> the m16
[2:07] <Luingar> MAKE IT OUTTA CANDY
[2:07] <vurtual> an m16 that cannot fire fully automatic, cannot fire just one bullet, which has slightly more damage for no reason
[2:07] <Luingar> like
[2:07] <vurtual> or the ak which cannot hit things?
[2:07] <Luingar> um
[2:08] <Luingar> m16 fires full auto...
[2:08] <Luingar> )_)
[2:08] <vurtual> there's two of them
[2:08] <vurtual> the SCAR
[2:08] <Luingar> and the ak can hit things, if you can aim for shit
[2:08] <Luingar> yeah, i don't use the scar
[2:08] <vurtual> ooh, normal shotgun, or shinier shotgun that deals slightly more damage?
[2:08] <Luingar> but it's the best weapon for taking down tanks
[2:08] <KodaichiZero> the other thing was
[2:08] <vurtual> autoshotgun or autoshotgun that looks differently and sounds like a door being slammed.
[2:08] <KodaichiZero> I wanted to replace the tank with the heavy
[2:08] <Luingar> PFFF
[2:08] <vurtual> KodaichiZero, been done
[2:08] <Luingar> it does!
[2:08] <Luingar> lol
[2:08] <vurtual> infact the charger with heavy
[2:08] <Luingar> i never realised that
[2:08] <KodaichiZero> oh okay
[2:09] <Luingar> spaz12 does sound like a door being slam. that's funny as hell
[2:09] <Brett> <-- would have been completely happy with a TF2 -> zombie apocalypse conversion thing
[2:09] <vurtual> I didn't even know you could make the SPAS 12 look that ugly

[2:10] <Subculture> I've got the pigment shit done.
[2:10] <Vis{ROTR2010}> learn before you speak
[2:10] <Vis{ROTR2010}> dumbo
[2:10] <Luingar> make it so scouts can drop items, to relay them from wherever they are to the other guys
[2:10] <vurtual> what
[2:10] <vurtual> I linked to the heavy charger
[2:10] <Vis{ROTR2010}> The chrome shotgun DOESN'T do more damage
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> It's spread pattern
[2:11] <vurtual> it's the same pointless shotgun ok
[2:11] <Luingar> naw, it's smaller
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> The normal pump spreads
[2:11] <vurtual> if I need a slightly different choke I will stand sliiiightly farther or closer
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> the chrome shoots wide
[2:11] <Luingar> not that you'd notice at all
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> That's true
[2:11] <vurtual> slliiiiightlllllyyyyyy diiifffeeereeent
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Except you get more double kills with the normal then the chrome :P
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> DOUBLEKILL
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> MULTIKILL
[2:11] <vurtual> I had a guy who argued the SCAR was better, because he could hit slightly more from accross the entire map
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> ULTRAKILL
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> FANTASTIC
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> UNBELIEVABLE
[2:11] <vurtual> slliiiiigghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhtly better
[2:11] <Vis{ROTR2010}> UNBELIEVABLE+
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> lol
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> anyways
[2:12] <Luingar> oh, and dont forget how the silenced smg (and i've tested this) does more damage than the non-silenced one
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> L4D2 does have "useless' weapons, I guess
[2:12] <KodaichiZero> alright time to see if it works
[2:12] <vurtual> way too many
[2:12] <KodaichiZero> and btw
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> The silenced SMG fires faster
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> even though that's bs
[2:12] <vurtual> also those fancy new crescendo things
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> as they're clearly both MAC 10s
[2:12] <Luingar> and each round does more damage
[2:12] <vurtual> no
[2:12] <KodaichiZero> replacing sounds in L4D2 is amazingly easy
[2:12] <vurtual> the silenced smg is a mac10 thing
[2:12] <vurtual> the original smg is an uzi
[2:12] <vurtual> or whatever it was
[2:12] <Luingar> naw, the unsilenced one is an uzi
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Oh, really?
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> It's hard to tell
[2:12] <KodaichiZero> much more so than CSS or TF2
[2:12] <Luingar> aye
[2:12] <vurtual> Yes, you never played l4d did you.
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> you don't see the gun from the butt often
[2:12] <vurtual> just 2
[2:12] <Vis{ROTR2010}> o.o
[2:13] <vurtual> sucks to be youuu
[2:13] <Luingar> i like l4d better
[2:13] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Anyways
[2:13] <Vis{ROTR2010}> there ARE alot of useless guns
[2:13] <vurtual> l4d2 was more thrown together than the original
[2:13] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I mean
[2:13] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I understand why people would favor them

[2:13] <Vis{ROTR2010}> the pump shotgun

[2:40] <Subculture> 'Pretty badass' is not descriptive enough for me
[2:40] <CruelNoise> here's the site: http://www.alientrap.org/nexuiz/
[2:40] <CruelNoise> apparently some company is trying to port it to consoles.
[2:41] <Subculture> SCREENSHOT MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?

[2:45] <CruelNoise> but not stoned
[2:45] <vurtual> and will play FPSes with such fury you'll have to go lie down and rest after it
[2:45] <vurtual> and scare people
[2:46] <vurtual> break a few mice from how quickly you click
[2:46] <vurtual> and be able to simeltaneously parse every sound happening in the game for exactly where it is
[2:46] <CruelNoise> do you want to play a game?
[2:46] <vurtual> It's scary.
[2:46] <Konogan> Your mom is.
[2:46] <CruelNoise> to experience, or to watch?
[2:46] <Konogan> J\K
[2:46] <vurtual> random shooting and jumppad noises becomes like... you can just know where each person is, you'll just turn around and hit people, and not even realise it
[2:46] <Azathoth> NOPE
[2:47] <CruelNoise> i need to get surroundsound.
[2:47] <Konogan> ^
[2:47] <vurtual> I jsut have stereo
[2:47] <vede> Heh. I checked out the location of one of those dumbass dragon things people have been going crazy with on the forums.
[2:47] <vurtual> it was good enough
[2:47] <Azathoth> if by surroundsound you mean "laid"
[2:47] <vurtual> I'll save the ATV-ing for when I find one like the ATVs I like

[2:49] <CruelNoise> what?
[2:49] <CruelNoise> i need to get on the forums more
[2:49] <vurtual> on the topic of sigs
[2:49] <vurtual> I remember seeing a forum once
[2:49] <vurtual> where sigs were massive
[2:49] <vurtual> like, fat people looked skinny massive
[2:49] <vurtual> two screens or longer
[2:49] <vurtual> and posts were just one or two sentences
[2:50] <vede> On the forums. People have all those goddamn dragons with messages going "PLEAE CLICK MY EGG LINK IM A RETARD" so their dragons can get bigger lame-ass dragon images.

[2:51] <Uniju> you can just grab the scorllbar and take it down
[2:51] <vede> Precisely, CruelNoise.
[2:51] <CruelNoise> or maybe ten
[2:51] <CruelNoise> ten is a better number
[2:51] <LG_Legacy> Interesting
[2:51] <Azathoth> the younger the better
[2:51] <vede> So I just decided to figure out the URLs for the dragon images.
[2:51] <vurtual> Uniju I couldn't
[2:51] <vede> I could make my sig into the most epic goddamn dragon army ever, and people would just be all like "OMFG UR SO MUCH COLER THAN I AM"
[2:51] <vurtual> I was scrolling and sliding and the sig was just too big
[2:52] <vurtual> vede, every combination, do it
[2:52] <vurtual> Anyways I think this bike is having engine trouble

[2:54] <vede> CruelNoise, why would I download them?
[2:54] <CruelNoise> i dunno

[3:03] <CrazySpai> Oh wait. http://minecraft.net/ircrules.jsp
[3:05] <Yourself> it turned out that the seminar was really boring
[3:05] <vurtual> this bike chase is awesome
[3:05] <vurtual> escaped, then blew a bridge, taking out cops
[3:05] <Yourself> and i didn't learn anything from it
[3:06] <vurtual> now riding on a beach without a back tire
[3:06] <Yourself> save for the fact that i have to go to 6 of them every semester, it was a complete waste of time
[3:06] <CruelNoise> how is that possible?
[3:08] <LG_Legacy> What the hell
[3:08] <CruelNoise> What the hell
[3:08] <LG_Legacy> I save my map and it keeps saying there is indev blocks? I checked each block, and ticked Remove indev blocks
[3:09] <vurtual> so my bike has survived all that, but the engine is smoking, and the back tire is a bent-up metal rim now.
[3:10] <AndrewPH> vurtual, you can blow up bridges?
[3:10] <CruelNoise> how is it riding, vurt?
[3:10] <vurtual> AndrewPH, well you pirate so I don't tell you.
[3:10] <AndrewPH> brb google
[3:10] <vurtual> level 6 trigger bombs are powerful
[3:11] <CruelNoise> dirty pirate dirtbags
[3:11] <AndrewPH> vurtual, so is a nuke
[3:11] <AndrewPH> I didn't know level 6 trigger bombs were stronger than a nuke
[3:11] <vurtual> level 6 nukes
[3:11] <AndrewPH> I modded my trigger bombs to be nukes
[3:11] <vurtual> Also the nuke cannot deal the functional power of the trigger bomb
[3:11] <AndrewPH> fair point
[3:12] <vurtual> furthermore someone just asked me to play runescape
[3:12] <eritz> kick them in the balls
[3:12] <eritz> thrice
[3:12] <CruelNoise> awesome!
[3:12] <CruelNoise> gotta go.
[3:12] <vurtual> eritz, let me try to show you how creepy they are
[3:12] <CrazySpai> Alright, so I think I broke my /infdev/
[3:12] <vurtual> next time quatroking is on, ask him if he's ever downloaded a GB of hentai on dial-up
[3:12] <AndrewPH> he has
[3:13] <vurtual> or asked someone to send him a hentai DVD
[3:13] <AndrewPH> he has

[3:16] <vurtual> if only because they look a tiny bit similar
[3:16] <LuciferZ> And he just asked you for a hentai dvd?
[3:16] <vurtual> no
[3:16] <LuciferZ> I am lost
[3:16] <vurtual> he did actually ask for one from another guy in an IRC channel
[3:17] <vurtual> because the dude bought it, realised he did not find it any way to turn him on, and had no use for it.
[3:17] <vurtual> so he mailed it to them

[4:06] <Kokopure> I'm here
[4:07] <Kokopure> for all the good that does
[4:07] <Kokopure> also I hope that's a stuffed fox
[4:07] <Kokopure> :<
[4:07] <LuciferZ> Probably is.
[4:07] <Kokopure> given that if it really drowned, it'd probably be on its side (and mangier-looking), I think that's likely.
[4:08] <LuciferZ> Yeah. It looks as though it was walking as well. Probably posed.
[4:09] <Kokopure> question
[4:09] <Kokopure> can you craft one cloth block into nine silks?
[4:09] <Kokopure> probably not >_>?
[4:09] <Kokopure> I don't know if it's different to the way you can craft irons into iron blocks and then reverse craft them.
[4:12] <Rooster> I need some new minecraft content. I'm having update convulsions
[4:12] <Kokopure> haha
[4:12] * Rooster bleeds from the nose
[4:13] <Kokopure> I hope the next update is either new mobs, or putting mobs into infdev.
[4:13] <Kokopure> or merging infdev with indev.
[4:13] <Kokopure> because while I love the environments in indev
[4:13] <vurtual> Rooster, the only cure is debate. Is incest okay [y/n] DO YOU VOTE AGAINST THIS RANDOM BILL are puppies adorable?
[4:13] <Kokopure> I sort of lose my motivation if there's nothing to kill.
[4:13] <Kokopure> incest is fine.
[4:13] <Rooster> what
[4:13] <Kokopure> and puppies are adorable
[4:14] <Rooster> Malikat filled me up with debate
[4:14] <Kokopure> debate is lighter than air
[4:14] <Kokopure> so you should be floating
[4:14] <vurtual> So he "filled you up" by "debating", huh?
[4:14] <AndrewPH> Did somebody say incest?
[4:14] <Kokopure> someone sure did!
[4:14] <AndrewPH> :D
[4:14] <vurtual> yes we did

[4:15] <vurtual> IT'S HALF OFF RIGHT NOW ANDREW HURRY
[4:15] <vurtual> is it incest if multiple members of an IRC channel engage in activities, even if they're unrelated?

[4:21] <vurtual> aaa
[4:21] <Kokopure> I'm on floating islands and it occurs to me.
[4:21] <Kokopure> the islands can only be so deep.
[4:21] <Kokopure> ... and there's no lava.
[4:21] <vurtual> now I'm playing the mario theme on my mouse buttons
[4:21] <Kokopure> so...
[4:22] <Kokopure> does that mean that there's no deep ores?
[4:22] <Kokopure> I haven't even encountered iron ore.
[4:24] <LuciferZ> If you're on a deep floating map, the lower islands will have the minerals
[4:24] <LuciferZ> And they aren't likely to have much.
[4:25] <LuciferZ> A small deep floating map averages nine diamond, I believe.
[4:28] * Dragoon_Jett (JohnGalt@d67-193-178-149.home3.cgocable.net) has joined #minecraft
[4:30] <Kokopure> you've done enough of this to offer me averages?
[4:30] <Kokopure> wow
[4:30] <vurtual> 9/1=9
[4:30] <vurtual> 10+8/2=9
[4:31] <Kokopure> and yeah, I'm not on a deep floating map.
[4:31] <Kokopure> just a floating map, sadly
[4:31] <Kokopure> so I doubt I'll get any useful ores :\ oh well.
[4:31] <Kokopure> on the plus side
[4:31] <Kokopure> when you're mining you can suddenly find yourself FALLING THROUGH SPACE
[4:31] <Kokopure> keeps you on your toes.
[4:33] <Kokopure> I think it'd be neat for the bases of floating islands to be full of lava, if Notch could figure out how to do that.
[4:33] <Kokopure> the downside to that would be that if you dug from a lower island to a higher one
[4:33] <Kokopure> you risk engulfing your house with lava
[4:33] <Kokopure> but that's cool in its own way :D
[4:33] <quaxar> I think that you are thinking poorly
[4:33] <Kokopure> :<
[4:34] <KodaichiZero> "Still going slow, but here?s a new screenshot!"
[4:34] <Kokopure> why do you think that I'm thinking poorly
[4:34] <KodaichiZero> dammit. :(
[4:34] <quaxar> It would be better to make meteors randomly hit down on indev and produce lava pools
[4:34] <Kokopure> oh KodaichiZero
[4:34] <quaxar> than what you are saying
[4:34] <Kokopure> you made me sad
[4:34] <Kokopure> quaxar, I'm only suggesting a way to make the rarer ores appear at all on floating island maps <_<
[4:34] <quaxar> oooh
[4:34] <CruelNoise> sup kodachi?
[4:35] <KodaichiZero> nothing really
[4:35] <quaxar> lol I was like infdev
[4:35] <vurtual> infdev floating islands
[4:35] <vurtual> fairly wide, but immensely deep
[4:35] <Kokopure> well that would also be awesome
[4:35] <Kokopure> and I hope they have lava
[4:35] <quaxar> notch said that infdev will have floating islands
[4:35] <quaxar> Its on the very edge of the world map or something
[4:35] <Kokopure> well infdev and indev will just be merging soon.
[4:35] <Kokopure> very edge/

[4:36] <quaxar> the edges are floating islands accordign to when I asked notcha bout it
[4:36] <quaxar> like 3 weeks ago
[4:36] <Kokopure> oh really
[4:36] <Kokopure> I didn't think there would be "edges" really
[4:36] <Kokopure> in an infinite map
[4:36] <quaxar> Its not infinite
[4:36] <Kokopure> speaking of which, it's not infinite vertically, is it?
[4:36] <quaxar> Its just really, really huge
[4:37] <Kokopure> well I know not really infinite.
[4:37] <Kokopure> but twice the area of the earth?
[4:37] <Kokopure> I mean come on
[4:37] <Kokopure> that's a ways to walk to find the edge
[4:37] <quaxar> you are placed randomly on the map
[4:37] <LuciferZ> No koko
[4:37] <LuciferZ> First, it's 8 times
[4:37] <quaxar> so you can be generated on an edge
[4:37] <vede> Eight times, not two.
[4:37] <LuciferZ> Second, it's not infinitely deep
[4:37] <Kokopure> oh, I thought it was 1.8 times
[4:37] <Kokopure> neeevermind
[4:37] <quaxar> it used to bew

[5:24] <CruelNoise> noo
[5:24] <Legolord> If Notch added him...
[5:24] <LuciferZ> It's so colorful and happy
[5:24] <Legolord> I would quit the game, and ask for a refund
[5:24] <Kokopure> eh.
[5:24] * CruelNoise would do the same
[5:24] <Kokopure> he seems mildly spooky.
[5:24] <LuciferZ> But who knows what eldritch things lurk in the abyssal night of the deepest caves?

[5:54] <vurtual> Maybe minecraft should have a certain block that cannot be destroyed
[5:54] * Rooster needs to learn how to use computer hardware
[5:54] <vurtual> it never vanishes, it cannot be dug out of existance
[5:55] <LuciferZ> Maybe it should be a high contrast, darker version of the natural stone.
[5:55] <vurtual> you cannot dump it out of existance
[5:55] <vurtual> there will be around 2000 in an infdev map
[5:55] <vurtual> they must never come together
[5:56] <Rooster> What the fuck are you talking about
[5:56] <KodaichiZero> wow
[5:56] <KodaichiZero> MarbleHornets: this looks amazingly epic
[5:56] <KodaichiZero> but is it actually any good?

[5:58] <vurtual> then when you do bring all 2000 together, the planet turns into a gigantic breast over time, morphing into soft flesh, and will pull itself towards the other planet on the other side of the universe, crushing the universe.
[5:58] <Cial> quick while he(?) is gone
[5:59] <LuciferZ> Wait what about a gigantic breast?
[5:59] <vurtual> the infdev world morphs into it
[5:59] <vurtual> hills and details will slowly melt into a surface just above sealevel
[5:59] <vurtual> while random blocks become flesh
[6:00] <LuciferZ> And why are they being crushed together?
[6:00] <LuciferZ> Is this universal woman groping herself?
[6:00] <vurtual> eventually, only a perfect sphere will remain, and a single gigantic nipple the size of antarctica but slightly smaller
[6:00] <vurtual> that nipple's eventual location will be where the blocks will attempt to go near.
[6:02] <vurtual> or maybe a one ring that grants the wearer gradually increasing power
[6:03] <LuciferZ> Or maybe one nipple ring
[6:03] <vurtual> yes
[6:03] <vurtual> wear it and you will grow ROUND BOOBS
[6:03] <vurtual> flash players with it to get power for it

[6:04] <KodaichiZero> vurtual: these are the ideas that will svae gaming
[6:05] <outsomnia> that's how.
[6:05] <LuciferZ> Vurtual this is why no one believes you
[6:05] <vurtual> and I care why?
[6:05] <LuciferZ> I'm not saying you have to care
[6:05] <LuciferZ> I'm just saying
[6:05] <LuciferZ> This is why no one believes you
[6:05] <vurtual> I have no concrete identity and have the amazing ability to assume the personality of anyone I want, I do anything I want.
[6:05] <Legolord> Yeah...
[6:06] <vurtual> This is an amazing freedom.
[6:06] <LuciferZ> Welcome madam, to the internet.
[6:06] <vurtual> Also your sentence was you believing me a little bit.
[6:06] <Legolord> who would like a block mob, one that pretends to be a normal block, but makes hardly noticable clicks, and when you go near, RAWR!
[6:06] <LuciferZ> My beliefs are ever shifting and far from concrete.
[6:06] <vurtual> yes and it should rape-attack you, except shredding your entire body to bits instead
[6:07] <LuciferZ> No way, it should be docile
[6:07] <outsomnia> >implying it can survive enough arrows to blot out the sun
[6:07] <Legolord> and dice you up into a nice minecrafter salad
[6:07] <LuciferZ> But it's only defense mechanism is trying to scare the shit out of you
[6:07] <vurtual> jumps ontop of you, assumes normal block position, and makes you look entirely dead while it chews away your health over time. Unless someone realises what's going on, and attacks it, you will die and everyone will think you were already dead.
[6:07] <LuciferZ> I want herds of them
[6:07] <outsomnia> >:]
[6:07] <Legolord> You can tame them into being pets
[6:07] <vurtual> or maybe it's like a puppy
[6:07] <Chezhead> I want a mob mush like the hunter from L4D, as it just rushes you and jumps high. That would be awesome and make caves even creepier...
[6:07] <Legolord> :D
[6:07] <vurtual> a rapey puppy, who will pin you down.
[6:07] <LuciferZ> They should be like those goats that lock up when they get scared
[6:08] <Legolord> Or
[6:08] <vurtual> but it doesn't try to kill you, even though it might injure you while doing this.
[6:08] <vurtual> you cannot talk or scream for help while it is doing this.
[6:08] <LuciferZ> So if you run into a heard they all roar at once and pass out
[6:08] <outsomnia> Fuck it, where are my flying enemies already?
[6:08] <outsomnia> Also-
[6:08] <outsomnia> Tree monsters.
[6:08] <Legolord> a mob that assumes the looks of another friendly player, and when you get near, reveals its Slenderman and rapes you with his tentacles, probing every niche of your body.
[6:09] <LuciferZ> Kinky.
[6:09] <Legolord> Quite.
[6:09] <outsomnia> >implying I wouldn't be shooting every player I come across anyways.
[6:09] <LuciferZ> A mob that looks like a friendly player but is really a creeper.
[6:09] <LuciferZ> >Implying without green text
[6:09] <vurtual> sounds hot Legolord
[6:09] <outsomnia> >implying using [19:09] <LuciferZ> >Implying without green text or ""'s is a better way of quoting.
[6:09] <vurtual> it isn't rape if it's consensual
[6:09] <outsomnia> :>
[6:09] <outsomnia> ^
[6:10] <vurtual> but it is rape again if I react in such violent eurphoria that it kills them
[6:10] <Legolord> it isnt rape if you enjoy it ~SilentlyRandom
[6:10] <vurtual> no it's not rape if it's consensual
[6:10] <vurtual> you can enjoy it and not want it
[6:10] <Chezhead> Floating-island monsters, really friendly things you can build on, but if you dig into it too much, it secretes lava and stuff on it turns to sand
[6:10] <LuciferZ> Maybe if you get raped by it, it wipes your harddrive afterwards.
[6:10] <Chezhead> If you hit it's center a couple times, it starts disintigrates
[6:10] <LuciferZ> I just want golems.
[6:11] <LuciferZ> I want craftable golems.
[6:11] <outsomnia> Yessss

[6:12] <Chezhead> What about giant sand-trap things that suck in everything near it
[6:13] <LuciferZ> Text from girlfriend "I have a question..."
[6:13] <vurtual> and it has a mouth that fits inside th minecrafter-man I have a hard time talking normally when turned on
[6:13] <LuciferZ> Why does she do this
[6:13] <vurtual> Z, it will be hot.
[6:13] <vurtual> Approach it calmly, interested, wondering.
[6:13] <LuciferZ> Oh okay that's a relief.
[6:13] <LuciferZ> False alarm
[6:13] <vurtual> and slightly irrelivantly turned on but you'd suck at that
[6:13] <Chezhead> BOOM, it kills you
[6:14] <LuciferZ> I take pride, vurtual, in my inability to hide being turned on.

[6:15] <LuciferZ> That's because you allegedly don't have a boner when you're turned on.
[6:15] <Brett> my girlfriend isn't calm at all when she's horny
[6:15] <vurtual> yeah but eeeven on the internet
[6:15] <Brett> we have the footprints on our car windows to prove it
[6:15] <LuciferZ> Lol, Brett
[6:15] * Trace_Legacy is now known as JSA
[6:16] <LuciferZ> If I were a lesser man you would get chewed out. Bragging about sex on the internet is a terrible idea.
[6:16] <Brett> lol
[6:16] <Brett> i don't care
[6:16] <Kokopure> sheesh
[6:16] <Brett> let people believe what they want to
[6:16] <Kokopure> Brett sounds like a manwhore name
[6:16] <vurtual> the hood is the best spot
[6:16] <LuciferZ> Manwhore=man
[6:16] <Kokopure> oh I see what you did there
[6:17] <LuciferZ> By the way.
[6:17] <vurtual> only on older cars that don't feel like molded soybean plastic though
[6:17] <Brett> passenger seat is always interesting, trying not to knock the car out of park
[6:17] <Brett> offers a bit of a challenge
[6:17] <LuciferZ> I just leave her in the trunk tbh
[6:18] <Amiculi> Hrm, Marblehornets begins to bore me
[6:18] <Brett> lol
[6:18] <Amiculi> apparently it's about deadbeat filmmakers eveading a taxman
[6:18] <vurtual> wait, how common is porn using the shifter to pleasure someone? Or just the act of it
[6:18] <LuciferZ> Lol
[6:18] <LuciferZ> Never seen it myself
[6:18] <LuciferZ> You'd have to be pretty loose to get any penetration pleasure out of that though.
[6:19] <LuciferZ> Maybe the e brake
[6:19] <LuciferZ> Sounds dangerous though.
[6:19] <vurtual> what, everyone knows a shifter-sized guy is the best
[6:20] <LuciferZ> I tell you what, any girl tries that shit in my vehicle, she's getting tossed out on the nearest shoulder.
[6:20] <vurtual> also some cars have small enough shifters so you dissapointments don't have to feel so bad
[6:20] <Brett> what if she covers the stick with a little plastic baggy first
[6:20] <vurtual> Also I could probably do it while driving.
[6:20] <Brett> lmao
[6:20] <LuciferZ> Vurtual
[6:20] <LuciferZ> You worry me.
[6:20] <LuciferZ> I guess a baggy would be okay.
[6:20] <vurtual> one foot on the throttle, one on the wheel.
[6:21] <vurtual> Z, what if it's an alien chick, who, whenever turned on, makes acid?

[6:21] <vurtual> that doesn't dissolve flesh
[6:21] <Brett> i dated one of those, except it didn't exit the way you're thinking
[6:21] <outsomnia> Still fine
[6:21] <LuciferZ> Same answer
[6:22] * outsomnia slaps LuciferZ around a bit with a large trout
[6:22] <LuciferZ> Damage my car, she should be grateful I don't get out the machete.
[6:22] <vurtual> what if it DID, and she threatened to force you to go down on her?

[6:22] <vurtual> heh
[6:23] <vurtual> infact I will invent a car that can be driven by pleasuring yourself with the shifter
[6:23] <vurtual> It'll be a bit like a fighter plane in layout maybe.
[6:23] <Brett> LOL
[6:23] <vurtual> Actually a plane would be easy to fly while turned on I guess... as long as you come to your senses during danger.
[6:23] <LuciferZ> Vurtual, there's one major flaw in your plan

[6:25] <TkTech> Animator: Lost interest?
[6:25] <Legolorde> Ohi, back
[6:25] <LuciferZ> I noticed the server dropped off earlier.
[6:25] <Brett> AS A STRONG PROPONENT OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS, WOMEN CAN TOO DRIVE
[6:25] <LuciferZ> BRETT WHAT THE FUCK
[6:26] <outsomnia> But
[6:26] <vurtual> IT'S ACTUALLY A LEVEL OF AWESOMENESS
[6:26] <outsomnia> What about their left's?
[6:26] <vurtual> ONLY AWESOME PEOPLE CAN DRIVE
[6:26] <LuciferZ> GO OUT BACK
[6:26] <outsomnia> I PROPOSE THEY CAN'T MAKE LEFT TURNS.
[6:26] <LuciferZ> AND CHOP OFF NECESSARY BITS
[6:26] <vurtual> AND MOST WOMEN ARE NOT AWESOME BUT I AM SO I AM OK WITH THIS
[6:26] <Dysgalt> LuciferZ wtf happened to my trebuchet
[6:26] <Animator> TkTech, I thought there were other people that were going to make articles with me.
[6:26] <Brett> actually every women who's ever driven me around has only one flaw
[6:26] <Brett> a tendency to swerve into oncoming
[6:26] <Brett> but
[6:26] <Brett> other than that
[6:26] <outsomnia> As I said.
[6:26] <LuciferZ> It was either delete it or have it hover over the water, Dysgalt.
[6:26] <outsomnia> Their lefts.
[6:26] <Dysgalt> Trebuchet boat?
[6:26] <Dysgalt> I mean catapault
[6:26] <outsomnia> Server where?
[6:27] <TkTech> Animator: There were, but everyone besides developers seem to have floated away...awaaay....awwwayyy
[6:27] <LuciferZ> Didn't think of that.
[6:27] <vurtual> being left-handed made the whole "swing out of rusted pickup with no driver door, fire pistol at target, while shooting down a hillside" thing much easier actually
[6:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> vurtual
[6:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> did you know
[6:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> that portal isn't really a puzzle
[6:27] <LuciferZ> Animator, did you know that vurtual was female?
[6:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> portal is an action FPS
[6:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> where you shoot everyone
[6:27] <Animator> Yeah. You should also notice that there are about 3 people that've banned here over there.
[6:27] <Vis{ROTR2010}> including zombies
[6:27] <Animator> That may or may not want my blood.
[6:27] <outsomnia> Nonono
[6:27] <outsomnia> Portal is a platformer.
[6:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Animator: wuut
[6:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> lies
[6:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> portal isn't real

[6:28] <LuciferZ> Portal is sediment shaped sediment
[6:28] <outsomnia> now brb food
[6:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Wow LuciferZ
[6:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> you ruined our consensus
[6:28] <vurtual> actually a P-51D stick would be pretty managable to insert

[6:28] <LuciferZ> I do what I can
[6:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> erm
[6:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> shit
[6:28] <Animator> And since there's no consitency with artciles from other people, and people over there that hate my guts, I'm better off not in it.

[6:28] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I've missed my target

[6:29] <vurtual> seriously it's like fire in your arm
[6:29] <Vis{ROTR2010}> Is it?
[6:29] <vurtual> you could also screw up someone's nerves
[6:29] <Vis{ROTR2010}> I've gotten a knife in my right thigh

[7:06] <vurtual> If it worked, someone could be staring at me sitting strangely in my underwear. :ohdear:
[7:06] <KodaichiZero> vurtual: so I heard you like guys maturbating?
[7:06] <Cial> or is it?
[7:07] <KodaichiZero> that's all you'll find on there
[7:07] <KodaichiZero> from what I've heard.

[7:07] <Cial> so says SouthPark
[7:07] <KodaichiZero> I don't own a webcam though so idk
[7:07] <KodaichiZero> understandable i suppose

[8:04] <LuciferZ> Oh
[8:04] <LuciferZ> Why would that be rude?
[8:04] <Cial> dunno

[8:10] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Graveler looks nothing like Golem though.
[8:10] <Koko|hoamwerkz> and he loses two arms
[8:10] <vurtual> they're big and round
[8:10] <AndrewPH> graveller should -> onyx
[8:10] <Cial> vurtual yes and also im being sarcastic
[8:10] <Koko|hoamwerkz> how is that an advantage
[8:10] <KodaichiZero> whatever... with Magikarp evolving into Gyarados, anything be's possible
[8:11] <AndrewPH> onix rather
[8:11] <vurtual> I just realized how dumb graveller sounds
[8:11] <vurtual> golem's also a bit... strangely generic.
[8:11] <KodaichiZero> most pokemon names are generic
[8:11] <AndrewPH> missingno should evolve into magikarp
[8:11] <AndrewPH> which should then evolve into moltres
[8:11] <KodaichiZero> Abra, Kadabra? Hitmonchan - jackie chan, hotmonlee = bruce lee
[8:12] <vurtual> no articuno becomes zapdos then moltres
[8:12] <Parthon> so when pokemon evolve, do they remember who they are, or is it a whole new form that erases the existance of the previous one?
[8:12] <vurtual> mitmonchan and hitmonlee were pretty much ok
[8:12] <vurtual> except their name is basically
[8:12] <AndrewPH> Parthon, evolve not die
[8:12] <KodaichiZero> Raichu evolves into Electabuzz
[8:12] <vurtual> hit, as in fighting
[8:12] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Parthon
[8:12] <Koko|hoamwerkz> they remember
[8:12] <vurtual> mon as in pocket monster/pokemon
[8:12] <vurtual> and lee/chan

[8:13] <KodaichiZero> in japan they are blatantly called Pocket Monsters
[8:13] <Yourself> you've got to be kidding me
[8:13] <AndrewPH> pokemon should be pronounced pokeh mawn according to what it was originally
[8:13] <AndrewPH> Parthon, they do now
[8:13] <Koko|hoamwerkz> well Andrew
[8:13] <Koko|hoamwerkz> it is Japanese
[8:13] <vurtual> pockymon
[8:13] <vurtual> like pokemon
[8:13] <KodaichiZero> poh kay mon
[8:13] <vurtual> and delicious
[8:13] <Parthon> mm .. freaky
[8:13] <Koko|hoamwerkz> that's how they'd pronounce it
[8:13] <Parthon> it would still be weird waking up the next day completely different
[8:13] <Koko|hoamwerkz> in fact that's what the accent was supposed to get across to us stupid foreigners
[8:13] <vurtual> pokey mans or pockymon
[8:13] <Koko|hoamwerkz> but we never listen
[8:13] <vurtual> Parthon they do it while awake
[8:13] <AndrewPH> Parthon, or the next minutes
[8:13] <vurtual> suddenly, you have new shape
[8:13] <KodaichiZero> Brock uses ground-type pokemon
[8:14] <Koko|hoamwerkz> wrong!
[8:14] <Koko|hoamwerkz> he uses rock-types.
[8:14] <Koko|hoamwerkz> they just happen to also be ground-types.
[8:14] <KodaichiZero> Misty uses ice types
[8:14] * Koko|hoamwerkz nerds all over the place
[8:14] <Koko|hoamwerkz> you're doing this on purpose :<
[8:14] <KodaichiZero> yeah lol
[8:14] <KodaichiZero> I like to induce nerdrages
[8:14] <AndrewPH> Hey guys you know that one thing from cortex command
[8:14] <AndrewPH> it has a large
[8:14] <AndrewPH> capsule on top
[8:14] <Yourself> and people think metric vs imperial arguments are stupid
[8:14] <AndrewPH> and small legs?
[8:14] <Yourself> at least measurement systems exist
[8:14] <AndrewPH> I just made one of those out of a $5 bill
[8:14] <vurtual> but what about hitmontop?
[8:15] <KodaichiZero> Metric vs imperial is like Canada vs the US
[8:15] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Hitmontop is expensive to try and evolve
[8:15] <vurtual> no it's like ALL of europe vs USA
[8:15] <Koko|hoamwerkz> since you have to buy Proteins and Irons
[8:15] <Koko|hoamwerkz> to balance out the Attack and Defense
[8:15] <Parthon> where everyone knows Canada/Europe is better than the US except people from the US
[8:15] <Koko|hoamwerkz> and that shit's expensive
[8:15] <vurtual> MESSAGE FROM THIS
[8:15] <vurtual> STEROIDS TURN YOU INTO A FREAK
[8:15] <KodaichiZero> USA gets whatever the fuck it wants because it has nukes, end of story
[8:15] <Koko|hoamwerkz> dude a lot of countries have nukes
[8:15] <Koko|hoamwerkz> 13 countries I think
[8:15] <vurtual> USA has the most powerful military and it doesn't even spend that much money
[8:15] <vurtual> okay it spends more than most other countries combined
[8:15] <Koko|hoamwerkz> uh ha
[8:16] <vurtual> but relatively little
[8:16] <Koko|hoamwerkz> we spend fucktons of money vurtual
[8:16] <KodaichiZero> yeah......
[8:16] <Parthon> USA gets what it wants because it controls the economy with all of it's omnomnom overconsumption
[8:16] <vurtual> Parthon, we do have a gigantic military
[8:16] <Koko|hoamwerkz> I think China's starting to get that one, Parthon.
[8:16] <KodaichiZero> I think
[8:16] <vurtual> we spend the most, and also can easily contain all other spendings combined, and invent most of the cool stuff
[8:16] <Yourself> <vurtual> no it's like ALL of europe vs USA
[8:16] <Koko|hoamwerkz> they do have over 1/8th the world's population.
[8:16] <LuciferZ> Koko, wrong. 'Fuckton' is a standard unit of measurement, equal to the number of nukes America has.
[8:16] <Parthon> the giant military helps :P
[8:16] <KodaichiZero> China makes shitty electronics
[8:16] <vurtual> z, they just reduced the amonut
[8:16] <Yourself> bah, where's that picture?
[8:16] <Parthon> LuciferZ: but it's an imperial fuckton .. metric fucktons are larger
[8:16] <KodaichiZero> but everything else is basically fine
[8:17] <vurtual> no metric is smaller
[8:17] <Parthon> so the US has less nukes in the metric system
[8:17] <vurtual> equivelant to Europe's supply
[8:17] <Yourself> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Metric_system_adoption_map.svg
[8:17] <vurtual> which has to remain consistent
[8:17] <Bomb_Spammer> Because as everyone knows
[8:17] <Bomb_Spammer> Europe is a country

[8:21] <Koko|hoamwerkz> they don't evolve, but they're evolutions

[8:29] <vurtual> in the anime
[8:30] <LuciferZ> Oh. I don't remember.
[8:30] <vurtual> furthermore she actually has two shirts on.
[8:30] <LuciferZ> That detracts from hotness a little
[8:30] <vurtual> but the only one you can actually see makes it look like she's got a shirt that only has one button, on the front.

[8:53] <Koko|hoamwerkz> before May is out? I expect it.
[8:53] <vurtual> Whitney's gym is shaped like Clefairy
[8:53] <TkTech> JCS^: ~meh~
[8:53] <JCS^> hehe
[8:53] <Koko|hoamwerkz> vurtual
[8:53] <Koko|hoamwerkz> what's your opinion on Black and White
[8:53] <TkTech> Lighting is bonnared ATM
[8:54] <TkTech> until local lighting gets fixed multiplayer is out
[8:54] <JCS^> idk how fast notch is on development
[8:54] <vurtual> It's a gray area for me.
[8:54] <JCS^> =X
[8:54] <Koko|hoamwerkz> oh I see what you did there
[8:54] <TkTech> Development is particularly slow ATM because he just moveed
[8:54] <Koko|hoamwerkz> I'll probably get black. so I don't get called a racist.

[8:54] <Koko|hoamwerkz> but if a friend gets black I'll take white.
[8:54] <Koko|hoamwerkz> there should be more information the day after tomorrow
[8:54] <TkTech> Yeah, Koko|hoamwerkz doesn't mind the color of his cookie
[8:54] <Koko|hoamwerkz> or tomorrow, depending on your time zone
[8:55] <vurtual> It'll probably be very dull.
[8:55] <Koko|hoamwerkz> racial harmony cookie!
[8:55] <Koko|hoamwerkz> :D
[8:55] <Koko|hoamwerkz> to be completely honest that cookie is pretty segregated.
[8:55] <Yourself> multiplayer will be the last thing he adds to infdev
[8:55] <Koko|hoamwerkz> the black and white are together, but they don't mix.
[8:55] <vurtual> and bland
[8:55] <Koko|hoamwerkz> vurtual
[8:55] <Koko|hoamwerkz> I think it'll be fantastically amazing and my hopes are through the roof
[8:55] <Koko|hoamwerkz> therefore I will be disappointed
[8:55] <Koko|hoamwerkz> :3
[8:56] <vurtual> Maybe it'll be a stark change from the others.
[8:56] <vurtual> With pokemon that aren't so colorful
[8:56] <Koko|hoamwerkz> ...
[8:56] <Koko|hoamwerkz> that'd be a little odd
[8:56] <vurtual> ish, I guess

[8:56] <Koko|hoamwerkz> do you think you'll still be able to have your pokemon walk around with you D:
[8:56] <vurtual> but still, rainbow pokemon are certainly not that great.
[8:56] <Koko|hoamwerkz> I didn't see any of that in the screenshots
[8:56] <Koko|hoamwerkz> hey!
[8:56] <Koko|hoamwerkz> don't be hatin' on the gay pokemons
[8:57] <vurtual> sure ho-oh is nice
[8:57] <Cial> oh they have the name for the new ones
[8:57] <vurtual> and porygon was a cool at first
[8:57] <vurtual> but seriouusly.
[8:57] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Cial, I mean besides Zoroark and whatever the prevolution is
[8:57] <vurtual> What's next, some poop-throwing monkey avatar thing?
[8:57] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Porygon is neat
[8:57] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Porygon2 looks really cool too
[8:57] <Koko|hoamwerkz> PorygonZ looks like it took some bad acid.

[8:58] <Cial> -_-
[8:58] <vurtual> as a steel type
[8:58] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Rhyperior, Electivire, Magnezone, and Magmortar are all unnecessary.
[8:58] <Koko|hoamwerkz> and i do not like them.
[8:58] <vurtual> with a ridiculously high speed
[8:58] <Koko|hoamwerkz> I also don't like Honchcrow.
[8:58] <Koko|hoamwerkz> a pimp pokemon? really?
[8:58] <vurtual> Heatran *shiver*
[8:58] <vurtual> There are teams that are just Honchkrow and 5 Lopunny
[8:59] <Cial> lmao
[8:59] <Koko|hoamwerkz> stupid people loooove pokemon
[8:59] <bildramer> indeed
[8:59] <Yourself> this is worse than the minecraft sequel conversation
[8:59] <Koko|hoamwerkz> actually, depending on your team
[8:59] <Koko|hoamwerkz> you could get owned by 6 level 1 rattatas.
[8:59] <bildramer> actually, pokemon is just stupid discussion in #minecraft
[8:59] <bildramer> so let's talk about ponies
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> PONYTA IS THE BEST
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> :D
[9:00] <Yourself> dwarf ponies
[9:00] <Cial> .........koko what are you using magikarp?
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Cial
[9:00] <KodaichiZero> oh wow
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> do you not know of the rattata strategy?
[9:00] <Cial> no
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> okay.
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> this is what happens.
[9:00] <Cial> i avoid using the damn things
[9:00] <KodaichiZero> yu're still talking about pokemon?
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> you send out a level 1 rattata, or just, really low level rattata.
[9:00] <KodaichiZero> here's a thing: how do I catch the legendary dogs?
[9:00] <Yourself> KodaichiZero: it's torture
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> now.
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Cial
[9:00] <Cial> KodaichiZero got a better topic?
[9:00] <Koko|hoamwerkz> were I to do that
[9:01] <Koko|hoamwerkz> what would you do to my rattata?
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> no i dont
[9:01] <bildramer> there's always a better topic than that
[9:01] <bildramer> e.g. where the hell has Notch gone
[9:01] <Yourself> bone city
[9:01] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Cial you're not curious about rattatas D:
[9:01] <Koko|hoamwerkz> okay whatever I'll pretend like you're talking to me
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> I could induce rage by saying that pokemon should be implemented in minecraft but I'd rather not
[9:01] <Cial> with my soul silver party i send in my Beedrill and use twinneedel
[9:01] <bildramer> ..
[9:01] <Koko|hoamwerkz> if I sent out a level 1 Rattata you'd kill it
[9:01] <Koko|hoamwerkz> right
[9:01] <Koko|hoamwerkz> ?
[9:01] <Koko|hoamwerkz> just own its ass
[9:01] <Cial> yes
[9:01] <Yourself> KodaichiZero, we could start a political and or religious fight
[9:01] <Koko|hoamwerkz> but!
[9:02] <KodaichiZero> level 1's are frigging rare man
[9:02] <Koko|hoamwerkz> my rattata
[9:02] <Yourself> that's usually a good way to end whatever discussion is currently going on
[9:02] <Koko|hoamwerkz> is holding a Focus Sash.
[9:02] <Koko|hoamwerkz> which prevents 1-hit KO's.
[9:02] <Yourself> and then relish in the chaos that was entirely your fault
[9:02] <KodaichiZero> that's super cool bro
[9:02] <Koko|hoamwerkz> your attack will leave my rattata with one HP regardless of what attack you use
[9:02] <vurtual> Koko|hoamwerkz, use blaze kick with my blaziken, or flamethrower/slash with my charizard, or razor leaf with meganium
[9:02] <KodaichiZero> one time my Togepi used Guillotine
[9:02] <Koko|hoamwerkz> then
[9:02] <Cial> ah but thats the beauty of poison types
[9:02] <Koko|hoamwerkz> my rattata
[9:02] <Koko|hoamwerkz> will use Endeavor
[9:03] <Koko|hoamwerkz> which will bring YOU down to 1HP.
[9:03] <Koko|hoamwerkz> next turn?
[9:03] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Rattata uses quick attack.
[9:03] <KodaichiZero> A guillotine slices off you neck, and then makes you faint instantly.
[9:03] <Koko|hoamwerkz> unless YOU have a super-fast move of your own, you will die.
[9:03] <Koko|hoamwerkz> that is how a level 1 Rattata pwns your ass.
[9:03] <vurtual> Koko|hoamwerkz, try it
[9:03] <AndrewPH> Koko|hoamwerkz, and if it misses any of those?
[9:03] <Marafk> wtf are you talking about
[9:03] <Koko|hoamwerkz> then you're screwed?
[9:03] <bildramer> Marafk: pokemon
[9:04] <Koko|hoamwerkz> oh, right, and this wouldn't work against a ghost-type.
[9:04] <Marafk> die
[9:04] <Koko|hoamwerkz> since both of those moves are normal-types.
[9:04] * bildramer (bildramer@p57A1AA0E.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has left #minecraft
[9:04] <Koko|hoamwerkz> but yeah, barring either a ghost type or a pokemon with a definite first-hit move
[9:04] <Koko|hoamwerkz> there is a solid chance you will get owned by 6 rattatas.
[9:04] <AndrewPH> not really
[9:04] <Koko|hoamwerkz> why not?
[9:04] <AndrewPH> if they miss even one of those they're screwed
[9:04] <Cial> since when did ghost type attacks become 100% useless against normal type
[9:04] <Koko|hoamwerkz> yes
[9:04] <Koko|hoamwerkz> but why would they miss?
[9:04] <vurtual> grind for accuracy
[9:04] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Cial
[9:05] <Koko|hoamwerkz> that's how it's always been
[9:05] <Koko|hoamwerkz> O_o
[9:05] <AndrewPH> Koko|hoamwerkz, Endeavor or quick attack :1
[9:05] <Cial> are you sure?
[9:05] <Koko|hoamwerkz> 1 what
[9:05] * bildramer (bildramer@p57A1AA0E.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #minecraft
[9:05] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Cial, I'm quite sure.
[9:05] <AndrewPH> 2/3 chance it will fail
[9:05] <Koko|hoamwerkz> what?
[9:05] <Cial> hmm i need to boot up an older one and check
[9:05] <Koko|hoamwerkz> their accuracy is both 100% normally
[9:05] <AndrewPH> Proof pls
[9:05] <Parthon> what does endeavour do?
[9:05] <ClassiestMedic> goonight all!
[9:05] <vurtual> reduce the target hp to yours
[9:06] <Cial> but me using ghost types is a new occurrence
[9:06] <Koko|hoamwerkz> lowers the opponent's HP to your HP level, Parthon
[9:06] <vurtual> and your focus sash kept you at 1

[9:06] <Koko|hoamwerkz> meaning your opponent will have 1HP
[9:06] <Parthon> aaah
[9:06] <Koko|hoamwerkz> and if you use quick attack
[9:06] <Parthon> they die
[9:06] <Koko|hoamwerkz> no matter how shitty your pokemon
[9:06] <Cial> but you can still die
[9:06] <Koko|hoamwerkz> you will do at least 1 HP of damage
[9:06] * bildramer pours some gasoline in the discussion
[9:06] <Cial> with the focus sash
[9:06] <vurtual> if you get 6 focus sash
[9:06] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Cial, not if you're holding a focus sash you can't, not in one turn
[9:06] <Parthon> so, have a pokemon with quick attack
[9:06] <bildramer> pokemon sux lol
[9:06] <vurtual> Cial, doom desire and focus sight
[9:06] <Parthon> or quicker-attack
[9:06] <Koko|hoamwerkz> it's worth noting
[9:07] <Koko|hoamwerkz> this strategy TOTALLY falls apart in double battles
[9:07] <Koko|hoamwerkz> since both your pokemon can just take on one rattata at a time
[9:07] <Koko|hoamwerkz> and they WILL kill it
[9:07] <Koko|hoamwerkz> with two separate attacks

[9:07] <outsomnia> wad is dis
[9:07] <Koko|hoamwerkz> ANYWAY
[9:07] <Parthon> could you also send the ratatta to sleep or something and attack it twice?
[9:07] <Parthon> perhaps make it confused so it hits itself
[9:07] <Koko|hoamwerkz> well actually Parthon
[9:07] <Koko|hoamwerkz> you could
[9:07] <outsomnia> Use Fissure.
[9:07] <Koko|hoamwerkz> but
[9:08] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Fissure's a OHKO, won't work
[9:08] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[9:08] <Koko|hoamwerkz> and
[9:08] <Koko|hoamwerkz> confusion causing moves are generally inaccurate
[9:08] <outsomnia> Use Guillotine.
[9:08] <Koko|hoamwerkz> same goes for sleep except for Breloom's Spore
[9:08] <Koko|hoamwerkz> however
[9:08] <AndrewPH> Koko|hoamwerkz, You can use it more than once because your hp won't be reduced
[9:08] <Parthon> koko: I know, but it's a level 1 ratatta, so you can just keep using it over and over and over
[9:08] <Cial> i still say induce an poison or burn and your strategy is fucked
[9:08] <Koko|hoamwerkz> I'm not sure how Focus Sash regards moves like Doubleslap or Fury Swipes
[9:08] <Koko|hoamwerkz> that is, attacks that attack more than once in one turn
[9:08] <Koko|hoamwerkz> Cial, that's true
[9:09] <Parthon> so it's only 100% awesome unbeatable, if it's against an all-attack power team?
[9:09] <vurtual> cial, still, it's situationally hillarious
[9:09] <Koko|hoamwerkz> but how accurate are poison and burning moves?
[9:09] <vurtual> nobody's prepared for it
[9:09] <vurtual> like the magikarp sweep or whatever
[9:09] <AndrewPH> Koko|hoamwerkz, what about paralyze?
[9:09] <Cial> depends on the move and what you are holding

[9:09] <Kokopure> hey, my software had a fight
[9:09] <Kokopure> awesome
[9:09] <Parthon> but also
[9:10] <Parthon> if you make a team to counter another team, you give up power
[9:10] <Kokopure> absolutely
[9:10] <Parthon> so if you make an anti-ratatta team, then any other team would have a chance of winning
[9:10] <Kokopure> right
[9:10] <Parthon> better chance*
[9:10] <Kokopure> because moves that are fantastic for countering an all-rattata team
[9:10] <Kokopure> suck in other situations
[9:10] <- *iKJames* Join #the
[9:10] <Kokopure> in most other situations
[9:10] <- *iKJames* Oops
[9:10] <Cial> but here is a thought
[9:10] <Kokopure> uh oh, thoughts D:
[9:10] <- *iKJames* I said a bad word
[9:10] <- *iKJames* xD
[9:10] <Cial> who in gods name uses a rattata team?
[9:11] <AndrewPH> You could just have one anti-rattatataatatatatat and have that rape everything
[9:11] <Kokopure> trolls, Cial
[9:11] <Kokopure> well Andrew
[9:11] <Cial> most trolls are to stupid to thing of a good strategy for them
[9:11] <vurtual> Parthon, you can easily just kill a rattata with an effect without nailing your team
[9:11] <Kokopure> even the best anti-rattata pokemon will probably get got by at least one rattata.
[9:11] <Kokopure> Cial, that's not even a little true.
[9:11] <Kokopure> there are really smart trolls out there.
[9:11] <Parthon> vurtual: it's the focus sash + quick attack part
[9:11] <Kokopure> they're the best at being the worst.
[9:11] <AndrewPH> Kokopure, no not really
[9:11] <vurtual> also I did not imply literally boning your team
[9:11] <Cial> i said most
[9:12] <Cial> not all
[9:12] <vurtual> or blaziken-on-may porn
[9:12] <Parthon> but if you have an attack with an effect, that helps
[9:12] * Koko|hoamwerkz (Kokopure@richard-a-king-2.umeres.maine.edu) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[9:12] <vurtual> well may ontop
[9:12] <AndrewPH> just one sleep enducing move and you're fucked
[9:12] <Kokopure> oh god don't turn this into a furry discussion
[9:12] <Kokopure> AndrewPH, yes, that's true
[9:12] <vurtual> that's not even furry ok
[9:12] <Parthon> are there any pokemon that can self heal?
[9:12] <Kokopure> if your sleep-inducing move hits
[9:12] <vurtual> furry would be like some sort of human-ified pokemon
[9:12] <Parthon> oh, but it wouldn't be quick enough to beat quick attack
[9:12] * AFK|Dae is now known as ZzZ|Dae
[9:12] <vurtual> but a literal pokemon itself would not be furry
[9:12] <AndrewPH> Kokopure, if it doesn't you can just try again
[9:12] <Kokopure> are you using a Breloom with Spore?
[9:12] <Kokopure> you're okay
[9:12] <Kokopure> AndrewPH
[9:12] <Jat> actually a literal pokemon itself is furry
[9:12] <Kokopure> that's the point
[9:12] <Kokopure> you get ONE TURN
[9:12] <Jat> i know this because of my research
[9:12] <Cial> Parthon: anything that know Rest, Roost, Recover
[9:12] <Kokopure> to kill the rattata
[9:12] <AndrewPH> no
[9:13] <Kokopure> after that it uses Quick Attack
[9:13] <Kokopure> and you are done
[9:13] <AndrewPH> you get a lot if you have a sleep inducing move
[9:13] <Kokopure> oh, yes
[9:13] <Kokopure> that's true
[9:13] <Kokopure> although
[9:13] <Parthon> but you can't kill it because of the focus sash
[9:13] <vurtual> jat, the whole furry movement is just human-animal thing art and cosplay and in some cases is acting like you have an inner animal
[9:13] <AndrewPH> Parthon, yeah you can
[9:13] <Kokopure> this Rattata only requires two moves.
[9:13] <vurtual> a pikachu isn't that
[9:13] <Kokopure> that is
[9:13] <Kokopure> Endeavor and Quick Attack.
[9:13] <Jat> furry movement? waht?
[9:13] <Kokopure> they can also learn Sleep Talk
[9:13] <Jat> also porn
[9:13] <Kokopure> sooooo
[9:13] <AndrewPH> Kokopure, if its health isn't 1 then quick attack doesn't do shit
[9:13] <AndrewPH> it's also level 1
[9:13] <Parthon> AndrewPH: I mean not in one turn
[9:13] <Kokopure> AndrewPH you're correct
[9:13] <vurtual> but may-on-blaziken porn technically isn't furry
[9:13] <Kokopure> well actually!
[9:14] <vurtual> it's anywhere between beastiality and really creepy
[9:14] <AndrewPH> Kokopure, no not well actually
[9:14] <Jat> it can be considered furry though
[9:14] <Kokopure> if it uses endeavor even if you don't hurt it to 1HP
[9:14] <Parthon> endeavour makes your pokemon's hp equal to the ratatta's
[9:14] <Kokopure> it's still a level 1 rattata
[9:14] <vurtual> jat, just like how zoophilia technically could be "considered" furry
[9:14] <Kokopure> and its HP sucks
[9:14] <Jat> it depends
[9:14] <Kokopure> you won't get lowered to 1HP
[9:14] <AndrewPH> Yeah but it won't be able to kill you
[9:14] <Kokopure> but you'll get lowered to like... 8
[9:14] <Jat> pokemon are more anthropomorphic than normal animals
[9:14] <Kokopure> AndrewPH, you're right, it won't
[9:14] <AndrewPH> It would take like 8 moves to kill yu then
[9:14] <Kokopure> however
[9:14] <Parthon> and you still have to hit the ratatta twice to kill it
[9:14] <Jat> either physically or personality
[9:15] <Kokopure> if it knows Sleep Talk
[9:15] <AndrewPH> Kokopure, your plan sucks deal with it
[9:15] <Parthon> and it could just keep casting endeavour
[9:15] <Kokopure> it has a 25% chance of using quick attack anyway
[9:15] <vurtual> Jat, so porygon=anthropomorphic
[9:15] <bildramer> are you guise still talking about uninteresting childish stuff
[9:15] <Kokopure> or endeavor anyway
[9:15] <vurtual> and magnemite
[9:15] <Kokopure> so
[9:15] <AndrewPH> Kokopure, aahhh but that's generally innaccurate
[9:15] <vurtual> Also, magnemite as a vibrator.
[9:15] <Jat> :|
[9:15] <Kokopure> yes it is
[9:15] <Kokopure> so are sleep-inducing moves
[9:15] <bildramer> Vibrator... what DF:
[9:15] <Parthon> endeavour is inaccurate?
[9:15] <AndrewPH> Wow kokopure's a moron
[9:15] <Kokopure> no, Parthon
[9:15] <Kokopure> Sleep Talk is
[9:15] <AndrewPH> Parthon, sleep talk
[9:15] <bildramer> ah well
[9:15] <Kokopure> AndrewPH, what?
[9:15] <Parthon> aah right
[9:15] <bildramer> #pokemon
[9:15] <AndrewPH> 25% chance of using a move
[9:16] <Parthon> well, you aren't relying on it, just have it as a "for funsies"
[9:16] <Kokopure> yeah
[9:16] <Kokopure> nobody uses an all-rattata team to try to win
[9:16] <Kokopure> they use it to troll
[9:16] <bildramer> lol
[9:16] <Kokopure> anyway, AndrewPH
[9:16] <Kokopure> if your rattata knows Sleep Talk, Endeavor, and Quick Attack
[9:16] <Kokopure> the chances of using either other move are not 25%
[9:16] <Kokopure> they are 50%
[9:17] <Kokopure> which means your strategy has exactly a coin toss of working.
[9:17] <vurtual> what other moves would you add
[9:17] <Kokopure> none
[9:17] <Kokopure> you don't need any others
[9:17] <vurtual> but for fun
[9:17] <bildramer> http://irexistus.com/listen.pls DugTooDeepRadio!
[9:17] <Kokopure> uh
[9:17] <Parthon> it's a troll team
[9:17] <Kokopure> that's not the point
[9:17] <Kokopure> you shouldn't have a fourth move
[9:17] <bildramer> lol, bay12 community did it again
[9:17] <vurtual> if you accidentally induced sleep on an oppoent you could have tail whip.

[9:52] <Yohanu> 1 year of consult education coming up this fall
[9:52] <vurtual> my brother had an old joystick, black with gray buttons

[9:52] <Azathoth> :D

[9:52] <Azathoth> i take it you're a CS student?

[9:53] <Yourself> there's a numerical methods class
[9:53] <Yohanu> except perhaps post-uni education
[9:53] <Azathoth> dont' know a lot of aerospace engineering people. most of the engineering students here do chemical and petroleum shit

[9:56] <Yohanu> none
[9:56] <Azathoth> D:
[9:56] <Yohanu> i only ever use dual monitors for development

[9:56] <Azathoth> having a secondary task bar is nice though

[9:56] <Azathoth> i used to use ultramon or something when i had XP
[9:56] <Yohanu> the taskbar is horrible as it is
[9:57] <outsomnia> Adolix AWC, Fences, and rainmeter.
[9:57] <Azathoth> it basically splits clutter in half
[9:57] <Yourself> i could use my TV as a third monitor
[9:57] <Yourself> but it's hooked up to my ubuntu machine right now
[9:57] <Yohanu> my tv is too old to be used as a monitor

[9:57] <Azathoth> haha
[9:57] <Azathoth> i want to put my TV in the center
[9:57] <Yohanu> scart conversion makes for bad resolution
[9:57] <Azathoth> and have this 32" surrounded by two 17"
[9:57] <Azathoth> it would look silly
[9:58] <Yohanu> i just use my tv with xbox

[9:58] <Yohanu> except i dont watch tv channels
[9:58] <Yourself> unless i need to look at my minecraft server

[9:59] <Azathoth> stream sexy videos of yourself to me, vurtual
[9:59] <Azathoth> i promise i won't record them
[9:59] <Yohanu> older tv's + background noise = best way to sleep

[10:01] <Yourself> well, there's one on my laptop
[10:01] <Yourself> which i don't use
[10:02] <Cial> same
[10:02] <Yourself> the webcam, not the laptop
[10:02] <Azathoth> it doesn't really look much different from last time i saw it, tktech, which was actually quite a while ago :|

[10:09] <Yohanu> problem is the level of difficulty
[10:09] <Yohanu> it's always too easy
[10:09] <Yourself> you're going to have computers in soda cans soon, it'd probably be good that most people have a working knowledge of how to make computers do things
[10:10] <Yohanu> it's like having a basic class in how to use a steering-wheel
[10:10] <Yourself> i only found programming classes easy because i'd been doing it for over 4 years by the time i got to the first one
[10:10] <Yohanu> that's how trivial college programming courses are
[10:10] <Yourself> of course only one programming class is required for all engineers
[10:10] <Yohanu> lol
[10:10] <Yourself> and it was an introduction to matlab and C
[10:10] <Yohanu> my classes were so simple back in those days
[10:10] <Azathoth> i fucking hate matlab D:
[10:10] <Yourself> there are other programming classes like the numerical methods course i mentioned earlier
[10:10] <Yohanu> i finished total of 12 courses
[10:10] <Yourself> which is traditionally difficult
[10:11] <Yourself> although that depends on the professor you get
[10:11] <Yohanu> C#, Java, C++, PHP, 3 courses per lang
[10:11] <Yohanu> they are all the same pretty much, yet you get extra points per
[10:11] * TmTgr (TmTgr@123-243-131-125.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[10:11] <Azathoth> my university, as far as i know, has a couple of blowoff programming classes, like a 1 hour C++ course
[10:11] * Leo (deadpiroda@h49.64.188.173.dynamic.ip.windstream.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[10:11] <Yohanu> sounds better than these ridiculous things Azathoth
[10:11] <Yourself> but pretty much all the courses at the 400 level expect you to know how to program
[10:11] <Azathoth> but they're not even required for computer science majors
[10:11] <Yohanu> lol wtf
[10:11] <vurtual> without the auto-white on my webcam I look like I'm inside mountain deew.
[10:11] <Azathoth> we focus a lot more on theory, which is kinda of gay
[10:12] <Yohanu> i wanted moar programming theory during my education
[10:12] <Yourself> which is why i never went into CS
[10:12] <Yohanu> but noooo, "PLS MAKE DIS GUI"
[10:12] <Yourself> had a friend who was in CS

[10:12] <Yourself> said i should have been because i was able to help him with his homework
[10:12] <Yourself> he works at google now
[10:12] <Yohanu> o well, i'll get a real programming education this fall anyway
[10:13] <Azathoth> my school is big on research, so they put a lot of emphasis on the theory and less on actual practical applications
[10:13] <Yourself> and not because he's a good programmer
[10:13] <Yohanu> company educating me for a year before i become an employee etc :D
[10:13] <vurtual> man I look creepy
[10:13] <Azathoth> yep
[10:13] <Yourself> hopefully i'll also end up getting a job at google
[10:13] <Yourself> strange as it may sound
[10:14] <Yourself> i was going to go for a PhD, but there's a reason i started with a masters
[10:14] <mail2345> don't you know
[10:14] <Yourself> so i'd have a chance to get out
[10:14] <Yourself> if it turned out to suck
[10:14] <mail2345> that google's enivorment is so attractive
[10:14] <Yourself> which it kinda did
[10:14] <mail2345> so their employees don't notice
[10:14] <Yohanu> lol, luckily education is free here Yourself
[10:14] <vurtual> You know, I could probably hide under my desk and hold a mountain dew up, and pretend I'm that.
[10:14] <mail2345> that they are sucking your soul out
[10:14] <mail2345> to power their servers
[10:14] <Azathoth> i couldn't do graduate school
[10:14] <Yourself> well, i'm not paying for grad school because i'm an RA
[10:15] <Yourself> it's paying for me
[10:15] <vurtual> or get a mask
[10:15] <vurtual> brb mask
[10:15] <Yourself> i'm just tired of having homework
[10:15] <Yohanu> everyone gets paid to educate themselves here
[10:15] <Yourself> i've been in school for 19 years
[10:15] <Cial> lol vurtual that would mess with someone
[10:15] <Yourself> when i get my masters, it'll be 20
[10:15] <Azathoth> graduate school seems like it would require too much self motivation for me
[10:15] <Yourself> two fucking decades
[10:15] <Yourself> enough is enough
[10:15] <Yourself> mail2345, joke's on them
[10:15] <Yourself> i have neither a soul nor a life
[10:16] <Yohanu> lol, i could probably never stand working at google
[10:16] <Yourself> so it's really quite ideal from my point of view
[10:16] <mail2345> ahh
[10:16] <mail2345> k
[10:16] <Yohanu> too much php and boring programming
[10:16] <Yohanu> !
[10:16] <mail2345> they do use python
[10:16] <mail2345> here and there
[10:16] <Yohanu> rly
[10:16] <Yourself> and python is awesome
[10:16] <Yohanu> shame i dont like python either
[10:16] <Yohanu> not strict enough!
[10:16] <Yourself> fu
[10:17] <Yourself> strict enough how?
[10:17] <Azathoth> i don't really like python either
[10:17] <Yohanu> as in, ugly syntax and whitespace indentation
[10:17] <Yourself> need a language to shove bamboo shoots under your fingernails when you inevitably bugger something up?
[10:17] <Yohanu> forced whitespace intendation that is
[10:17] <vurtual> okay DO I HAVE THE GUTS TO GO ON OMEGLE VIDEO
[10:17] <Yourself> so you wouldn't indent otherwise?
[10:17] <Yohanu> obv i would
[10:17] <Yohanu> but it's so unreadable
[10:17] * mail2345 slaps Yohanu around a bit with a large trout

[10:18] <mail2345> stfu heritic
[10:18] <vurtual> guys how many people just entertainin' the slender man on there.
[10:18] <Yohanu> because there's nothing that really lets you see where a block starts/stops directly
[10:18] <mail2345> hey puyodead
[10:18] <Azathoth> { } are nice to have
[10:18] <mail2345> we have a heritic here
[10:18] <vurtual> I need opinions of omegle video
[10:18] <mail2345> mind cleaning up?
[10:18] <Yohanu> what Azathoth said
[10:18] <KodaichiZero> mail2345: why have I seen that line 100 times?
[10:18] <Yourself> i will never understand that
[10:18] <Yohanu> + constructors are dumb in python
[10:18] <vurtual> because hexen wasn't good enough KodaichiZero

[10:19] * KodaichiZero tries to understand why slapping someone around with a large trout is so popular nowadays
[10:19] <Yohanu> __init__ is such a dumb identifier for a constructor
[10:19] <Yourself> how are the constructors dumb?

[10:19] <Yourself> that's silly
[10:19] <Azathoth> yeah. i don't get the syntax for the default methods
[10:20] <Yohanu> i very much prefer oldschool langs
[10:20] <Yohanu> traditional programming syntax
[10:20] <Azathoth> i don't see why the constructor can't just be ClassName(blah blah blah)
[10:20] <Azathoth> or something
[10:20] <Yohanu> ye
[10:20] <Yohanu> we are in the wrong generation though Azathoth
[10:20] <Azathoth> there are some other default methods that are annoying to
[10:20] <Yohanu> lol
[10:21] <Yourself> if you don't come from a C++ or java background, it's confusing
[10:21] <Azathoth> like __tostr__ or something
[10:21] <Yourself> __str__?
[10:21] <Azathoth> yea
[10:21] <Yohanu> should have grown up in the late 80's
[10:21] <Yohanu> would have a much bigger chance of success as a programmer
[10:21] <vurtual> seriously guys should I go on omegle video?
[10:21] <Azathoth> i come from a C# and java background, and i find python to feel really... unstructured
[10:21] <Yourself> don't get me wrong, i do use C++
[10:21] <Yourself> and like it
[10:21] <vurtual> I've never, in my entire life, been face-to-face with anything
[10:21] <outsomnia> Vurtual, dewit.
[10:21] <Yourself> but i prefer python most of the time
[10:21] <vurtual> convince me
[10:21] <outsomnia> brb getting on omegle
[10:21] <vurtual> outsomnia I don't think I can have a mic
[10:21] <outsomnia> imeanwat
[10:21] <Yohanu> i tend to use Java mostly, despite its obvious flaws
[10:22] <Yohanu> mostly from habit
[10:22] <Yohanu> occasionally i use c++
[10:22] <Yohanu> but it's pretty rare
[10:22] <Yourself> it just takes too long to make anything in C++
[10:22] <Yohanu> nah
[10:22] <Yourself> unless i throw any pretense of design out the window
[10:22] <Yohanu> it's all about how much experience you have
[10:22] <Yourself> for some reason i just work a lot quicker in python
[10:22] <vurtual> my only talent is humming in amazing skill
[10:23] <Yourself> as of next year it'll be a decade's worth of C++ experience
[10:23] <Yohanu> lol
[10:23] <vurtual> I can do "we didn't start the fire" entirely in "herps" and "derps"
[10:23] <Yohanu> what really bothered me about college was the useless programming classes
[10:23] <Yohanu> seriously
[10:23] <Yohanu> never learned any common design patterns, algorithms, oop
[10:23] <AndrewPH> ????????????
[10:24] <Yohanu> luckily i knew all that shit before
[10:24] <Yohanu> but still
[10:24] <Yohanu> disappointing
[10:24] <Yourself> i can't remember much of CS101

[10:24] <Yohanu> my teachers were noobfags too
[10:24] <Yohanu> well
[10:24] <Yourself> i know we programmed lego robots to do something in the lego version of C
[10:24] <Yohanu> they knew thier shit decently
[10:24] <Yohanu> their*
[10:24] <Yohanu> but i was better!
[10:24] <Yohanu> so i had nobody to argue with
[10:24] <Yohanu> :(
[10:25] <Yourself> there was an semi-interesting problem when they were introducing recursion
[10:25] <Yohanu> lol recursion
[10:25] <Yourself> of coming up with an algorithm to solve the towers of hanoi
[10:25] <vurtual> okay guys is it normal for a laptop to have a built-in mic with its webcam
[10:25] <Yourself> i still have the notes from the class somewhere
[10:25] <Cial> yes
[10:25] <Yohanu> recursion is like, most basic thing evar
[10:25] <AndrewPH> vurtual, proove to me you're a chick ok
[10:25] <vurtual> no
[10:25] <vurtual> I'm too anonymous
[10:25] <Yourself> yeah, it came pretty early on
[10:25] <KodaichiZero> oh vurtual that reminds me
[10:25] <vurtual> Some people think I'm a guy, it makes me fit in
[10:25] <AndrewPH> DO EET
[10:25] <vurtual> I'm ubuntu cannot test my sound
[10:25] <Azathoth> only class i've taken so far where we did actual programming was an algorithms and data structure class
[10:26] <AndrewPH> I pretend to be creepy
[10:26] <Yourself> but you also have to keep in mind that this class was meant for people who don't know shit about programming
[10:26] <vurtual> furthermore I look way younger than I am.
[10:26] <AndrewPH> ok?
[10:26] <KodaichiZero> my laptop has a webcam
[10:26] <Yourself> or computers for the most part
[10:26] <KodaichiZero> so I can go on chatroulette
[10:26] <AndrewPH> vurtual, I don't have a webcam
[10:26] <AndrewPH> just a mic
[10:26] <AndrewPH> get steam on laptop -> mic
[10:26] <KodaichiZero> and cyber with some JB
[10:26] <Sparky20> Sup
[10:26] <Azathoth> JBJBJB
[10:26] <vurtual> no
[10:26] <Yourself> i remember one homework assignment i helped that friend of mine with
[10:26] <Yohanu> yeah, my problem was that college never had any real programming courses Yourself
[10:26] <vurtual> I can't find the mic device
[10:26] <KodaichiZero> I'm just kidding
[10:26] <vurtual> on my computer
[10:26] <AndrewPH> plz im lonely and none of my skype circlejerkers are on
[10:26] <Yohanu> it was all introductionary courses
[10:26] <Yourself> i think he had to use C++ to make an FSM
[10:26] <vurtual> KodaichiZero are YOU female
[10:26] <Yohanu> and no alternatives for me
[10:26] <Yohanu> :(
[10:27] <KodaichiZero> I really only would go there for the guitar-playing guys
[10:27] <Yourself> and he didn't really know C++ very well
[10:27] <Yohanu> lol, i wrote an FSM script engine when i was like 15
[10:27] <outsomnia> She is.
[10:27] <KodaichiZero> sadly, no. I am NOT female.
[10:27] <Azathoth> oh, i did do a little bit of assembly programming in a ficticious language
[10:27] <Yohanu> for mmo hax!
[10:27] <Yourself> so i got to do all the OO design and such
[10:27] <outsomnia> [23:27] <outsomnia> She is.
[10:27] <outsomnia> [23:27] <KodaichiZero> sadly, no. I am NOT female.
[10:27] <Yourself> was actually kind of fun
[10:27] <outsomnia> 2bad, u r nao.
[10:27] <Yourself> but i caught a flu from the computer lab, i think
[10:27] <Yohanu> OO design is the best part about programming Yourself
[10:27] <KodaichiZero> O_0
[10:27] <vurtual> sad
[10:27] <Yourself> since i got sick pretty soon after that
[10:27] <Yourself> yeah, i love OO
[10:27] <vurtual> do you have female boobs artifically attached to you?
[10:27] <KodaichiZero> what.... is this strange feeling?
[10:27] <vurtual> with science?
[10:28] <KodaichiZero> .... BOOBS?
[10:28] <Yourself> what made me love C++ even more was when i found all the template metaprogramming stuff
[10:28] <outsomnia> Boobs.
[10:28] <Yohanu> loll
[10:28] <Yourself> that shit's pretty wild
[10:28] <Yohanu> ye
[10:28] <KodaichiZero> oh wow awesome
[10:28] <vurtual> I will only appear on camera for people who have boobs.
[10:28] <Sparky20> BOBZ
[10:28] <Yohanu> that's where java lacks a bit Yourself
[10:28] <AndrewPH> vurtual, i have bobs
[10:28] <Yourself> i actually try to draw on that kind of thing in python
[10:28] <KodaichiZero> anyways goodnight all
[10:28] <Sparky20> lol
[10:28] <Yohanu> just classes instead of structs
[10:28] <AndrewPH> do they count?
[10:28] <vurtual> no you don't AndrewPH
[10:28] <Yohanu> no closures
[10:28] <vurtual> and they don't
[10:28] <AndrewPH> yes i do

[10:28] <Yohanu> no operator overloading
[10:28] <AndrewPH> damn
[10:28] <AndrewPH> racist
[10:28] <Yourself> eww, no operator overloading is lame
[10:28] <Yohanu> no delegates etc
[10:29] <Yourself> i can't wait for C++0x
[10:29] <Yohanu> that said, i rarely use operator overloading
[10:29] <Yohanu> i tend to want closures quite commonly though
[10:29] <Yohanu> :/
[10:29] <outsomnia> Okay quick polle.
[10:29] <Yourself> lambda functions?
[10:29] <AndrewPH> who wants to listen to me install xubuntu on my laptop?
[10:29] <Yourself> fuck yes
[10:29] <outsomnia> Obama or Biden?
[10:29] <Yohanu> luckily it will be in java 7
[10:29] <Yourself> xubuntu is awesome
[10:29] <AndrewPH> outsomnia, the game
[10:29] <outsomnia> ffffffffffff-
[10:29] <outsomnia> Tell him to run for something and I'll accept that.
[10:30] <AndrewPH> he ran for the game
[10:30] <Yohanu> i very much fancy java reverse engineering though Yourself lol
[10:31] <Yohanu> wrote a bytecode engineering library not too long ago
[10:31] <Yohanu> came in very handy
[10:31] <AndrewPH> who wants to listen to me play star wars battle music while installing xubuntu on my laptop
[10:31] <Yourself> i was writing a runtime math evaluation library in C++ some time ago
[10:31] <Sparky20> YES
[10:31] <Yourself> ended up just parsing to RPN and creating a little interpreter
[10:31] <AndrewPH> and by play I mean on the piano
[10:31] <Yourself> but i always wanted to JIT compile it
[10:31] <Sparky20> YES
[10:31] <Yohanu> i tend to only pick up ambitious projects Yourself lol
[10:31] <Yourself> and at the time i didn't really know much of anything about assembly
[10:32] <Yohanu> the bytecode library took me about 2 months to finish
[10:32] <Yohanu> ended up around 500 classes
[10:32] <Yourself> i ended up learning a lot about it just by looking at the disassembled output of simple C++ functions
[10:32] <Yohanu> worst part was implementing the goddamn bytecode instructions
[10:32] <Yohanu> so many
[10:33] <Yourself> yeah, that just sounds masochistic
[10:33] <vurtual> so wait
[10:33] <vurtual> why does my laptop have a WEBCAM
[10:33] <vurtual> but not a mic
[10:33] <Yohanu> works well now though Yourself
[10:33] <vurtual> I do AndrewPH
[10:33] <Yourself> i started writing a minecraft server in python recently, but my research has kept me busy enough that i haven't been working on it
[10:33] <Yohanu> used the library for my runescape hax0r thingies Yourself
[10:33] <Yohanu> lol
[10:33] <Yourself> which is usually how my projects go

[10:37] <Yourself> one of my classes was cancelled this week
[10:38] <Yourself> so no class tomorrow or thursday
[10:38] <Yohanu> i have no classes until next fall :D
[10:38] <Yohanu> primary education is over
[10:38] <Cial> teamspeak sucks on my laptop
[10:38] <outsomnia> Hmmm
[10:38] <Cial> Vent picks up better and has a better sound quality to it
[10:38] <Yourself> you mean sucks off?
[10:38] <outsomnia> Anyone know if solid iron is more durable than cobblestone?
[10:38] <vurtual> I neeed sleeeeeeep
[10:39] <AndrewPH> Cial, vent server costs money after a certain point
[10:39] <AndrewPH> what was it
[10:39] <outsomnia> (in mc terms of course)
[10:39] <vurtual> I shall practice my accents for later
[10:39] <AndrewPH> like over 5 users or something?
[10:39] <Yourself> outsomnia: it's pretty likely
[10:39] <outsomnia> Mmm, thanks
[10:39] <Yourself> although it depends on the iron
[10:39] <Cial> only if you dont host your self AndrewPH
[10:39] <Yohanu> only problem with ventrilo is how bad linux support it has (with wine)
[10:39] <Yohanu> other than that it's awesome
[10:39] <AndrewPH> Cial, no the server itself
[10:39] <AndrewPH> it costs money to get over a certain amount of slots
[10:39] <Yourself> there's a number of forms of iron that i don't know much about because i hated materials science
[10:39] <vurtual> I'm turning into a social person now.
[10:39] <Cial> not that im aware of
[10:40] <AndrewPH> Cial, I am though
[10:40] <AndrewPH> unlike you I actually look into this stuff
[10:40] * Cial sighs
[10:40] <Yohanu> ventrilo has stupid licensing though
[10:40] <outsomnia> Erm, I'm talking about Minecraft iron.
[10:40] <Yohanu> like most american productsd
[10:40] <AndrewPH> Teamspeak ftw
[10:40] <outsomnia> the solid blocks that you make from 3x3 of them, you know?
[10:40] <AndrewPH> it only costs money if you want a godly amount of slots.
[10:41] <AndrewPH> aka over 32
[10:41] <outsomnia> actually
[10:41] <AndrewPH> that might even just be a restriction for safety

[11:04] <Yourself> i know i don't think about sweden, so i don't expect sweden to think about me

[11:05] <Nesral> And Morning others (:
[11:05] <Yourself> neutrality
[11:05] <Cial> vurtual: chocolate
[11:05] <Notch> morning
[11:06] <Notch> I've seen the logs, yes. I don't really get the point. =)
[11:06] <vurtual> I bet Notch has to fight off droves of beautiful women
[11:06] <vurtual> ah who am I kidding nobody's probably heard of him where he lives
[11:06] <AndrewPH> Notch, It's so that uhh
[11:06] <vurtual> okay maybe internet fat chicks are floating over there right now. Give them a few years.
[11:06] <AndrewPH> logs are being logged.
[11:06] <Cial> "oh look its that crazy guy" ?
[11:06] <AndrewPH> and can be logged some more if you like deforestation.
[11:06] <vurtual> ax men
[11:06] <vurtual> but on the internet
[11:07] <AndrewPH> bananabot is an ax men
[11:07] <AndrewPH> it is multiple ax men
[11:07] <Sparky20> lol
[11:07] <vurtual> how about spearmen
[11:07] <vurtual> or swordsmen
[11:07] <AndrewPH> no
[11:07] <Sparky20> and women
[11:07] <AndrewPH> spearmen and swordsmen are gay
[11:07] <vurtual> maybe a few catapults
[11:07] <AndrewPH> women aren't on the internet
[11:07] <vurtual> WHAT ABOUT TREBUCHET
[11:07] <AndrewPH> vurtual is proof about that
[11:07] <vurtual> I'm not on the internet ffff-
[11:07] * vurtual vanishes
[11:07] * vurtual into sleep
[11:07] <Sparky20> lol
[11:07] <Yourself> <Notch> I've seen the logs, yes. I don't really get the point. =)
[11:07] <Sparky20> <Notch> I've seen the logs, yes. I don't really get the point. =)
[11:08] <Yourself> it's so everyone can see the embarrassingly horrible pokemon conversation that occurred here earlier
[11:08] <vurtual> notch, will mc get voice chat?
[11:08] <AndrewPH> Yourself, hahaha
[11:08] <AndrewPH> oh god
[11:08] <AndrewPH> Yourself, yes
[11:08] <Yourself> and experience the pain themselves
[11:08] <AndrewPH> SOMEBODY give him part of the conversation for him to read the rest
[11:08] <vurtual> rattata used ENDEAVOR
[11:08] <Sparky20> lol
[11:08] <Yourself> no, i will never force that on someone
[11:08] <vurtual> YOURSELF's health dropped to 1!
[11:08] <vurtual> Rattata used QUICK ATTACK
[11:08] <vurtual> YOURSELF fainted!
[11:08] <vurtual> anyways that basically sums it up
[11:08] <AndrewPH> IT ALL STARTED
[11:08] <AndrewPH> WITH
[11:08] <AndrewPH> [8:08] <KodaichiZero> I remember when I was little, I thought Venonat should evolve into Butterfree
[11:09] <Notch> vurtual: I'd like that, yes. Preferrably so you hear the voices in 3d as well
[11:09] <AndrewPH> Goddamnit kodaichi.
[11:09] <Notch> like if a guy to your left speaks, you hear it coming from the left
[11:09] <vurtual> oh and a discussion on wether porn of May lying ontop of Blaziken probably being mildly scared counted as furry
[11:09] <outsomnia> Surround sound voices?
[11:09] <Yourself> now i'm going to have to go back in time and kill him
[11:09] <AndrewPH> vurtual, nope but it counts as child porn
[11:09] <AndrewPH> may's like what
[11:09] <AndrewPH> 8?
[11:09] <vurtual> technically 10 with c-cups
[11:09] <Yourself> noooooo, don't start it again
[11:09] <vurtual> and face designs used by all the adults in the series
[11:09] <AndrewPH> let's compromise and say she's 8 with D cups
[11:10] <Sparky20> Notch, can you make the red brick texture into a stone brick texture, It would fit the game better.
[11:10] <vurtual> also things like DRAWN child porn technically aren't illegal
[11:10] <vurtual> feds haven't gone after any of us
[11:10] <AndrewPH> Notch, can you have a cookie, it would make the game better
[11:10] <AndrewPH> vurtual, actually they have
[11:10] <AndrewPH> to one guy
[11:10] <AndrewPH> for making simpsons porn
[11:10] <Sparky20> I said fit.
[11:10] <vurtual> well 1 guy
[11:10] <chibifs> Thank you for the response, notch. :)
[11:10] <Sparky20> Who likes the red bricks anyway.

[11:11] <AndrewPH> nobody listens
[11:11] <Yourself> /b/ isn't exactly the pinnacle of ethical behavior
[11:11] <AndrewPH> and?
[11:12] <vurtual> well still
[11:12] <Yourself> why would you standardize anything abainst what /b/ allows?
[11:12] <Yourself> against, even
[11:12] <AndrewPH> did I say I was?
[11:12] <vurtual> aanyways
[11:12] <vurtual> you are still imagining it
[11:12] <Cial> well its late good night to you all nice view from your office Notch i hope you like your new place
[11:13] <vurtual> and if it is child porn then you might want to run
[11:13] <Nesral> Notch, are you going to code all day today? :b
[11:13] <Yourself> it'd be like thinking e. coli is okay because it can be found on your asshole
[11:13] <vurtual> woah lots of people are getting offices
[11:13] <vurtual> Garry Newman, Notch... me.
[11:13] <AndrewPH> Notch, are you going to eat a cookie like I told you?
[11:13] * vurtual one day an office
[11:13] <Yourself> anyway, worst conversation ever is now over
[11:13] * AndrewPH was one day AN OFFICE
[11:13] <Sparky20> Everyone say notch.
[11:13] <Nesral> What are you going Vurtual?
[11:13] <Nesral> As you need an office?
[11:13] * vurtual was one day AN OFFICE, typing on a computer
[11:14] <vurtual> He got an email from his brother that said "DUDe"
[11:14] <vurtual> the end.
[11:14] <AndrewPH> when suddenly he got emails from his brother that said that alienz and monsterz were attacking his plase so he went
[11:14] <Notch> Nesral: That's the plan
[11:14] <vurtual> no no
[11:14] <vurtual> just that
[11:14] <Sparky20> Notch, can you make the red brick texture into a stone brick texture, It would fit the game better.
[11:14] <Notch> replying to emails, enjoying a nice espresso
[11:14] <vurtual> I use the red brick for southern stuff
[11:14] <AndrewPH> Notch, got any cookies?
[11:14] <Sparky20> But, But.
[11:14] <Notch> then I'm going to attack the lighting again and get sand and gravel and monsters into infdev
[11:14] <chibifs> Notch: What kind of beans? :)
[11:14] <Notch> I hope I can pull that off today
[11:15] <AndrewPH> No don't attack the lighting it might die
[11:15] <chibifs> We'll love you long time if you do.
[11:15] <Notch> I don't remember.. Some cheap bad one, the machine is new so I got what they had in store at the place. 0D
[11:15] <Sparky20> Notch, Stone bricks.
[11:15] <vurtual> anyways while you all talk to notch WHO IS ACTUALLY A HOT SWEDISH FEMALE LIKE ME EXCEPT I'M NOT SWEDISH I'm going to sleep WITH A FELLOW FEMALE WHO IS SWEDISH AND HOT BUT NOT NOTCH
[11:15] <Notch> I'm getting better beans soon
[11:15] <Nesral> Sounds great.
[11:15] <Sparky20> Grey bricks.
[11:15] <vurtual> too bad my caps key is broken
[11:15] <PyroWorks> pink bricks <3
[11:15] <PyroWorks> lol
[11:15] <vurtual> rainbow bricks
[11:15] <AndrewPH> vurtual, I somehow doubt that
[11:15] <chibifs> I demand in-game coffee brewing.
[11:15] <Notch> I'm not female!
[11:15] <chibifs> And beer brewing.
[11:15] <Cial> XD
[11:15] <AndrewPH> Notch, niether is vurtual
[11:16] <chibifs> grow hops and coffee cherries!
[11:16] <Notch> mmm.. coffee
[11:16] <vurtual> I actually am and you are just creeped out by it
[11:16] <Notch> what? haha
[11:16] <AndrewPH> Notch, have you ever been in the cockpit in a plane before?
[11:16] <PyroWorks> <@Notch> I'm not female! < i am so we need pink bricks :D
[11:16] <PyroWorks> lol
[11:16] <Cial> lets not start that fight
[11:16] <Notch> lol
[11:16] <PyroWorks> kiddin..
[11:16] <chibifs> Coffee could give you like a speed boost, and alcohol could make you immune to.. chat!
[11:16] <Yourself> one thing i never took the time to understand was the technical limitation behind the height of the infdev maps
[11:16] <vurtual> Now that you don't believe me I can freely not get asked to show my boobs, which would take lots of time to do.
[11:16] <chibifs> It would also make creeper your bro.
[11:16] <Notch> falling speed is faster than level generation speed, is one problem
[11:16] <Notch> another is lighting related, but that one is pretty complicated
[11:17] <Cial> vurtual: you are feeding trolls stop please
[11:17] <Sparky20> Bricks.
[11:17] <AndrewPH> Feed it your extra cookies
[11:17] <vurtual> once you pull the cork, mr grenade is your friend
[11:17] <Sparky20> Stone bricks.
[11:17] <Yourself> yeah, falling speed would definitely be a problem
[11:17] <Sparky20> For strong natural walls.
[11:17] <vurtual> Notch, just make you pass out after falling faster than so much through ungenerated worlds
[11:17] <Cial> Stone bricks = cobble stone?
[11:17] <vurtual> then you wake up
[11:17] <Yourself> it would be nice to have mountain ranges, though
[11:17] <vurtual> actually pass out and blur out ungenerated worlds
[11:18] <chibifs> vurtual, tits or gtfo? :P
[11:18] <vurtual> if you fall far enough you only take 1 heart of damage
[11:18] <AndrewPH> http://www.geekstir.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/goodneweveryone.jpg except replace the professor with notch
[11:18] <Yourself> i wonder how feasible it would be to have the map be finite height, but shift those columns of finite height depending on location
[11:18] <vurtual> chibifs my mic doesn't work and I don't have skype set up yet
[11:18] <chibifs> Haha. :P
[11:18] <Yourself> so each 16x16 block in the x-z plane has a base height associated with it
[11:18] <vurtual> otherwise I probably would, maybe
[11:18] <vurtual> or maybe just go in a bra the whole time.
[11:19] <AndrewPH> vurtual, btw your lack of showing them doesn't disturb us, 5 seconds in google can remedy that problem.
[11:19] <vurtual> AndrewPH yeah, but that's not very tasteful now is it
[11:19] <AndrewPH> says the male
[11:19] <chibifs> We're not /b/. It's fine.
[11:19] <AndrewPH> acting as a female
[11:19] <PyroWorks> its a trap!
[11:19] * Killing_Frenzie (Mibbit@bas3-sudbury98-1168052226.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
[11:19] <vurtual> actually a mysterious figure hiding behind layers of female and male identities
[11:20] <vurtual> most people consider me female over time
[11:20] <vurtual> or just drunk
[11:20] <vurtual> maybe socially outcast
[11:20] <PyroWorks> vurtual, im the drunk female here.
[11:20] <PyroWorks> i9m sorry.
[11:20] <chibifs> Notch, what we really need is the ability to craft solid gold teeth.
[11:20] <vurtual> then show us your boobies and prove it ma'am, until then you are merely buzzed
[11:20] <Sparky20> YES
[11:20] <Yourself> but, then, i don't know the details of the lighting and why height is an issue
[11:20] <chibifs> Which get us street cred.
[11:20] <vurtual> real men would just talk me into being on a webcam for talking with assurances of not trying to identify who I am.
[11:21] <Yourself> besides the fact that it has something to do with daylight
[11:21] <vurtual> SOLID GOLD CREEPER STATUES

[11:21] <chibifs> *high five* CREEPER IS MY BRO!

[11:21] <vurtual> they use their front feet as hands that are really low
[11:21] <Cial> well boys girls hermaphrodites and trolls good night and see you later
[11:22] <vurtual> no seriously I have to go to bed
[11:22] * vurtual intercepts cial later on
[11:22] <outsomnia> gnoit vurt and cial
[11:22] <Cial> later
[11:22] * Cial (chatzilla@209-42-180-41.wispnet.net) has left #minecraft
[11:22] <Yourself> or, wait, are chunks 8x8x8?
[11:22] <Yourself> i can't remember
[11:23] <Yourself> well, whatever
[11:24] <AndrewPH> just got an idea
[11:25] <Yourself> the suspense is killing me
[11:26] <mail2345> guys
[11:26] <mail2345> i can prove right now
[11:26] <mail2345> that i am female
[11:26] <mail2345> <3
[11:26] <Notch> Yourself: There are two chunks in the game now, confusingly enough
[11:26] <Notch> render chunks are 8x8x8
[11:26] <Notch> while level data chunks are 16x16x16, but stored in columns of 16x128x16
[11:27] <Notch> i should rename at least one of them
[11:27] <Yourself> that would explain why i have those two numbers in my mind
[11:27] <mail2345> notch, why is your sleep cycle normal?
[11:27] <mail2345> it's 9AM
[11:27] <mail2345> you should be sleeping
[11:27] <mail2345> tsk tsk tsk
[11:27] <Yourself> so what about this height variation idea?
[11:27] <Notch> because I live with a normal human being now, haha
[11:27] <Koko|hoamwerk> WHOAH
[11:27] <Yourself> besides making you spend more time in development, is there a technical limitation i'm missing?
[11:28] * Koko|hoamwerk is now known as Kokopure
[11:28] <Notch> I can probably solve it in the future
[11:28] <Kokopure> o_o it's the man himself and I totally missed his entrance.
[11:28] <Notch> but I want to get mp done before
[11:28] * Kokopure had a trumpet solo all prepared
[11:28] <Yourself> well, i mean keep the height finite
[11:28] <Kokopure> (no I didn't, I'm a liar)
[11:28] <Yourself> but offset the altitude of each level gen chunk
[11:28] <Yourself> so you could climb a tall mountain, but at any given point, the column you're on would only be 128 blocks tall
[11:29] <Yourself> bah, comma misues
[11:29] <Yourself> bah, spelling
[11:30] <Kokopure> bah words
[11:30] <Yourself> still can't build anything really tall
[11:32] <Yourself> but at least then you can have actual mountain ranges that have an altitude of more than 64 meters MSL, or wherever the sea level actually is
[11:32] <Notch> that could quite possibly work, but it'd be a bit unpredictable to the player
[11:33] <Yourself> it would be weird to be digging a horizontal tunnel and hit a wall
[11:33] <Notch> like if you start building a huge castle with some sky bridges, you'd run into an invisible wall
[11:33] <Notch> and that too
[11:33] <Yourself> yeah, the sky bit is more confusing since there's no clear visual marker
[11:33] * Tomcat[TGE] (Tomcat@c-24-7-147-126.hsd1.ca.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[11:33] <Yourself> at least underground you can hit bedrock
[11:34] <Kokopure> clearly this calls for a skyrock block?
[11:34] <Yourself> volumetric clouds :P
[11:34] <Kokopure> :3
[11:34] <Kokopure> Zeus decrees that you may go no further.
[11:35] <Yourself> well, we could just hope that no one goes and tries to build a huge castle on a steep slope :P
[11:35] <chibifs> I would just suggest that the cloud height could be the ceiling height, but I have hopes for a mode that is just as vertical as horizontal, Would be really neat to have some floating islands above the infinite terrain in some places.
[11:35] <chibifs> Like whenever biomes are put in, one of them just being an area of floating islands. :)
[11:36] <Kokopure> well in indev I like starting out on a low island
[11:36] <Yourself> that falling speed problem is really the tricky part
[11:36] <Kokopure> and making myself a staircase and dig through to the top of a higher one :D
[11:36] <Yourself> since you definitely won't really be able to make the level loading fast enough
[11:36] <Yourself> especially not in a multiplayer situation
[11:37] <Kokopure> http://pidgit.net/images/pidgit.png <--- I bet he can fix that!
[11:37] <yoshibot> It would be awesome to have an infinitely high map
[11:37] <yoshibot> so one can build as high a tower as one wants
[11:38] <chibifs> I think the height limit should also be pretty high because with infinite maps, it's a lot harder to find home. I'd always imagine the center of an encampment to be a massive tower that goes at least twice as high as the highest plateu, so it can be seen from a distance.
[11:38] <Kokopure> yoshibot, that would be neat except for you'd break the game if you fell off.
[11:38] <Kokopure> unless....
[11:38] <Kokopure> you invent something like "terminal velocity"?
[11:38] <Yourself> there is a terminal velocity
[11:39] <Kokopure> no, I know, I just mean, "if you start pushing on the limits of the game to load the blocks before you can get to them, it kills you".
[11:39] <Kokopure> -type.
[11:39] <yoshibot> simplest solution: keep a good chunk of the blocks below you in RAM
[11:39] <yoshibot> so if you fall you have space before the game has to load the other blocks
[11:40] <Yourself> well that's the slowest part of the fall
[11:40] <Yourself> so generating/loading those blocks isn't the problem
[11:40] <Kokopure> what is?
[11:40] <Yourself> it's once you get up to speed
[11:41] <Kokopure> and yoshibot, don't forget
[11:41] <Kokopure> it you do want "infinite height"
[11:41] <Yourself> unless you store an entire column, you're going to have to load something
[11:41] <Kokopure> that'd be equivalent to loading all the blocks to your right. forever.
[11:41] <yoshibot> not ALL the blocks
[11:41] * MercilessTD (MercilessT@115-64-20-105.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[11:41] <Kokopure> just a buffer you mean?
[11:41] <yoshibot> just enough to always give yourself time to load the blocks under you
[11:41] <Kokopure> but then it's not infinite :x
[11:42] <Kokopure> but you'll always fall faster than blocks can load. even with a buffer, given enough height you'll close that distance.
[11:42] <yoshibot> there's already a terminal velocity
[11:42] * HkZing (SING_LEE@n1164820143.netvigator.com) has joined #minecraft
[11:42] <Yourself> unless the point at which the fall catches up with the loading is at the bottom of the map
[11:42] <yoshibot> so you just keep a buffer of how many blocks you would fall at that velocity in however much time
[11:42] <MercilessTD> what are we talking about fellas
[11:42] <Yourself> terminal velocity is faster than the blocks can load
[11:43] <Kokopure> that's why I think it might be nice to just kill the character once they approach that speed.
[11:43] <Yourself> if it wasn't, there wouldn't be a problem
[11:43] <yoshibot> then BUILD BETTER BLOCK LOADING CODE.
[11:43] <Kokopure> I mean, they'll die on impact anyway, right?
[11:43] <yoshibot> black out!
[11:43] <AndrewPH> you try it then
[11:43] * Subculture (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[11:43] <yoshibot> thump. dead.
[11:43] <Kokopure> haha
[11:43] <Yourself> better block loading code doesn't speed up your hard drive or ethernet
[11:43] <Subculture> Hello kids.
[11:43] <Kokopure> "you blacked out!"
[11:43] <Subculture> Heya Notch.
[11:43] <Kokopure> and then you wake up on some shore
[11:43] <yoshibot> you have RAM, keep a lot of blocks
[11:43] <Kokopure> with a pig sniffin' you
[11:44] <yoshibot> but then you realize YOU'RE IN HELL
[11:44] <Notch> hey hey
[11:44] <yoshibot> hi :3
[11:44] <Kokopure> hey!
[11:44] <MercilessTD> Notch, hows things?
[11:44] <Yourself> i don't think you'd ever be able to keep enough blocks in ram to have levels have the same height as width
[11:44] <AndrewPH> http://tinychat.com/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[11:45] <Yourself> then not to mention that all those blocks you have in ram have to be loaded when you move horizontally
[11:45] <Subculture> So Notch. How 'bout I take you to my minecraft fort, and we'll enjoy some pig steaks together. Just you and me.
[11:45] <AndrewPH> vurtual,
[11:45] <Yourself> so you move to a new column and you have to load that entire column of "just in case" blocks
[11:45] <Kokopure> oh lord
[11:45] <Kokopure> well that makes skywalks impractical
[11:45] <yoshibot> not the ENTIRE column
[11:45] <yoshibot> just some buffer zone
[11:45] <yoshibot> most of it will be EMPTY SPACE.
[11:45] <yoshibot> which compresses up real nice
[11:45] <Notch> Thinks are freaking awesome. I've been away from coding for too long, though, haha
[11:45] <Kokopure> empty space still counts as a block, yoshi.
[11:45] <TkTech> Azathoth: You around?
[11:46] <Yourself> i didn't say an entire column
[11:46] <Azathoth> now i am
[11:46] <Azathoth> what's up?
[11:46] <Kokopure> doesn't air count as a block?
[11:46] <Kokopure> I thought I heard that.
[11:46] <Yourself> yes
[11:46] <TkTech> Azathoth: Refresh, try out the search
[11:46] <Notch> air counts as blocks
[11:46] <MercilessTD> Hehe, does that mean your going to bucle down and code for an obscene amount of hours?
[11:46] <yoshibot> but it's all one type of block
[11:46] <Notch> it's just a special unrendered block
[11:46] * laCour is now known as laCour|ZzZ
[11:46] <yoshibot> if you compress it you'd see a huge space savings
[11:46] <Notch> I hope so. :D
[11:46] <Azathoth> could you link me to it again, tktech? ^_^
[11:46] <Notch> ez's away this evening as well, so no distractions :D
[11:46] <Kokopure> ooh ooh
[11:46] <TkTech> Azathoth: Sure, http://beta.tkte.ch
[11:46] <Subculture> Notch, did you ever see my thread about having a 'scuba helmet' something that degrades on use? Allows the user to breathe under water?
[11:46] <Yourself> anyway, the point is that just making a large buffer probably isn't going to cut it
[11:46] <yoshibot> all the block data would have to say is "all air blocks"
[11:46] <AndrewPH> Notch, did you get a chance to break in your bed?
[11:47] <Kokopure> waaaaay
[11:47] <Kokopure> Subculture
[11:47] <MercilessTD> I sent you an email but you never replied. So i figured things must be busy
[11:47] <Azathoth> very nice, tktech
[11:47] * Kokopure had a thing to say all planned out x.x
[11:47] <yoshibot> you wouldn't even need to store all of the empty air blocks
[11:47] <yoshibot> just the stuff at the bottom
[11:47] <chibifs> Protoculture?
[11:47] <Kokopure> http://www.divingmuseum.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/product_images/icebuckethelmet.jpg <---- Subculture, do you mean like this?
[11:47] <Yourself> yoshibot: unless someone built into it
[11:47] <Kokopure> that's only what I was thinking
[11:47] <Notch> I like that idea, Subculture
[11:47] <chibifs> requesting giant robot airplane transformers.
[11:48] <yoshibot> Yourself: in which case only those blocks would be in memory
[11:48] <Notch> I'm replying to emails at the moment
[11:48] <Subculture> It seems kind of game breaking. If you were to implement it, I'd like to see it be kind of hard to get. Like, only being able to make it out of diamonds.
[11:48] <Subculture> Flippers too, flippers would be just as useful.
[11:48] <MercilessTD> Cool, hope you can find mine in there :3
[11:48] <Subculture> TODAY IN IRC: We pester Notch with our stupid ideas.
[11:48] <Kokopure> what would you make them out of, Subculture o.o?
[11:48] <Yourself> so what kind of data structure do you propose for storing only those blocks?
[11:48] <TkTech> Azathoth: Any other requests while I'm at it?
[11:49] <Yourself> i can imagine using a hash table for it
[11:49] <yoshibot> everything's on one coordinate system, right?
[11:49] <yoshibot> or is it all local...?
[11:49] * Misterangry is now known as Misterangry-ZzZzZ
[11:49] <Azathoth> not really, tktech. looks like you've got all the basics and you aren't really going for anything too fancy
[11:49] <Yourself> what do you mean?
[11:49] <TkTech> Azathoth: I wouldn't say that :0
[11:50] <TkTech> There's an online skin editor too
[11:50] <yoshibot> if it was all one coordinate system, it would be really easy to keep chunks in memory as just 3D arrays of blocks
[11:50] <Yourself> that's what's already done
[11:50] <Azathoth> oh, and are you going to add a link to the special skin setting page?
[11:50] <Subculture> Notch, I know you hear this enough, but this game will ERRUPT in praise and attention as soon as you push out Survival MP, I know a few of my goon friends who are just ITCHING to build a bitchin' impenetrable fortress with me.
[11:50] <Subculture> I can't wait.
[11:50] <yoshibot> and you wouldn't even need to keep ALL of them in memory, just all of them you could POSSIBLY REACH before the HD can give the game the next ones
[11:51] <TkTech> Azathoth: Yes, thats the point of the upload button :) The normal site, http://skins.tkte.ch, was the first site to do so
[11:51] <AndrewPH> guys shut up he's answering emails
[11:51] <Kokopure> oooh, erupt makes me think of volcanos.
[11:51] <TkTech> Azathoth: I approached Notch to get that added to minecraft.net
[11:51] <Subculture> If notch wants to read the shit I type he will.
[11:51] <Yourself> yes, i understand what you mean by buffer
[11:51] <Azathoth> ah
[11:52] <Yourself> and i'm telling you that such a buffer would probably be too large
[11:52] <Subculture> I thought of a couple of uses for gold too, but I'll post them in the forums rather than on here. Gold to me, should be a 'game function' buying resource. Like, 20 gold is needed for a new respawn point.
[11:52] <yoshibot> if you're that far up, really the only chunks in memory would be those containing your tower
[11:52] <Yourself> because even if you only store enough blocks that it can give you the next ones when you reach the end, what do you do after that?
[11:52] <Azathoth> would it be possible to maybe buffer more of the page in advance? scrolling can be pretty choppy
[11:53] <yoshibot> Yourself: It'll keep loading new blocks and freeing old ones every tic or so as needed
[11:53] <outsomnia> B> gold pls
[11:53] <yoshibot> so you ALWAYS have ONLY the blocks you need
[11:53] <outsomnia> i pay in iron lots
[11:53] <Yourself> i suppose if you made the sea level close to the "bottom" a large portion of the blocks could be merged out as air
[11:53] <Yourself> but if you're falling after the first buffer region, you're moving faster
[11:53] <Yourself> so the next buffer region has to be larger
[11:53] <yoshibot> you underestimate how small chunks are and how much RAM most computers have
[11:54] <TkTech> Azathoth: Doubled the high limit
[11:54] <yoshibot> each chunk is only like... 256 bytes at most
[11:54] <Yourself> it's 4 kb for one chunk
[11:54] <Yourself> and that's just block data
[11:54] <Yourself> so no lighting
[11:55] <Subculture> Lighting kills my computer
[11:55] <Subculture> Any time there's a lighting transition
[11:55] <Subculture> My FPS drops to fucking 3
[11:55] <Azathoth> that is some improvement. it wouldn't be possible to load more before the user reaches the bottom of the page, would it?
[11:55] <Yourself> well, one 16? chunk
[11:55] <AndrewPH> sux to be u
[11:55] <Kokopure> I like lighting!
[11:55] <Yourself> the level chunks are 16x128x16
[11:55] <Kokopure> oh, right, does anyone know offhand exactly what level of light will light a zombie/skeleton on fire?
[11:55] <Subculture> I -love- lighting, don't get me wrong.
[11:55] <Subculture> But it fucking kills my computer.
[11:55] <Kokopure> it seems to be... like... 7 or so.
[11:55] <yoshibot> 4k for block data?
[11:55] <Subculture> (IT's because I have an intel graphics card)
[11:56] * Kokopure gives Subculture a hug :<
[11:56] <yoshibot> how many are in one?
[11:56] <TkTech> Azathoth: Indeed it would be
[11:56] <Yourself> for a 16x16x16 set of blocks, that's 4kb
[11:56] <Kokopure> I don't know, yoshibot
[11:56] <TkTech> Azathoth: Hold on a second
[11:56] <Subculture> I can play Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl, and that's notoriously nasty.
[11:56] <Kokopure> I sort of just used a scale of ten
[11:56] <Subculture> But this little java game KILLS me
[11:56] <Yourself> minimum
[11:56] <Kokopure> so on a scale of 10, 0 being pitch black and 10 being fully lit
[11:56] <Kokopure> it seems like 7 lights mobs on fire
[11:56] <yoshibot> 4096 blocks in a chunk then
[11:56] <Kokopure> just seems though
[11:56] <Kokopure> I don't know at all.
[11:56] <Yourself> yes
[11:56] <yoshibot> each one being one byte exact.
[11:57] <Yourself> for just the block data without lighting
[11:57] <Azathoth> i think java limits the amount of ram that applets can use
[11:57] <yoshibot> your hard drive can load enough data per second to cover it
[11:57] <Subculture> Hey, can someone get on minecraft and take a flattering screenshot of my skin for me?
[11:57] <Azathoth> and your video card isn't doing any of the work, like it would in stalker
[11:57] <Kokopure> can't you do it, Subculture?
[11:57] <Subculture> How.
[11:57] <Kokopure> you can pause your little dude in midrun by clicking on him.
[11:57] <Kokopure> on your skin page.
[11:57] <yoshibot> Azathoth: LWJGL specifically uses the video card through OpenGL and JNI bindings, IIRC
[11:57] <Yourself> <yoshibot> your hard drive can load enough data per second to cover it
[11:57] <Subculture> No, I mean in world.
[11:57] <yoshibot> so Minecraft is hardware accelerated
[11:57] <Kokopure> oh.
[11:58] <Yourself> but that's exactly the problem, it can't
[11:58] <Kokopure> .... copy-paste?
[11:58] <Kokopure> I dunno
[11:58] <Azathoth> i take that back then
[11:58] <Kokopure> I could I guess
[11:58] <Azathoth> don't know anything about LWJGL
[11:58] <Kokopure> do you want me to?
[11:58] <Kokopure> I don't know what would be flattering though.
[11:58] <yoshibot> how can't it? max read on my dying shitty hard drive is like 4mb/sec
[11:58] <yoshibot> possibly more
[11:58] <Kokopure> your options are pretty much "flailing".
[11:58] <Subculture> yoshibot, is there any way to make it so my computer loads the lighting transitions better? I mean, if I can run TF2 and L4D, I should be able to run Minecraft no problem right?
[11:58] <Yourself> because the whole reason this issue came up was because you can fall faster than the level can load
[11:58] <yoshibot> Subculture: blame Notch for his inefficient lighting code?
[11:58] <Yourself> and you're saying that level can load faster than you can fall
[11:58] <yoshibot> i dunno
[11:59] <Azathoth> subculture, which version are you having troulbe in?
[11:59] <yoshibot> Each block is like 4kb, you said
[11:59] <yoshibot> how many blocks per second is terminal velocity?
[11:59] <Azathoth> also, there are like 3 conversations going on at once here? ><
[11:59] <Subculture> Bloody internet.
[11:59] <Yourself> and what's the maximum falling speed?
[12:00] <yoshibot> I asked you...
[12:00] <yoshibot> how much is it anyway?
[12:00] <yoshibot> sort of important to the debate
[12:00] <Kokopure> <Azathoth> also, there are like 3 conversations going on at once here? >< <-- welcome to IRC :D
[12:00] <Yourself> hell if i know, i'm going to measure an average now
[12:00] <Yourself> notch said it was faster than levels can load
[12:00] <Kokopure> one learns to multitask or one perishes.
[12:00] <Yourself> i took his word for it
[12:00] <Azathoth> also, if you're falling that fast, you're dead anyway. does it really matteR?
[12:00] <Kokopure> Azathoth, that's my opinion.
[12:01] <Kokopure> I think the game should just kill you once you threaten the game's block buffer.
[12:01] <Kokopure> you're dead anyway.
[12:01] <yoshibot> Even if it's a breakneck 32 unit blocks per seconds, that's... 8kb/sec to stream from hard drive since you'll be falling down WAY too fast to go any significant distance on any other axis than down
[12:01] <Kokopure> but yoshibot
[12:01] <Kokopure> if there's infinite height
[12:01] <Kokopure> that's still a huge problem
[12:01] <Azathoth> i'm going to bed now. cs test in the morning
[12:01] <yoshibot> Then it'll just keep loading blocks from the file
[12:01] <yoshibot> until you hit the ground and DIE.
[12:01] <MercilessTD> counterstrike tests
[12:01] <Kokopure> night Azathoth!
[12:01] <MercilessTD> man sweden is awesome
[12:02] <Azathoth> it's looking good, tktech.
[12:02] <Azathoth> not counterstrike tests -_-
[12:02] <MercilessTD> :P
[12:02] <Azathoth> and i don't live in sweden
[12:02] <MercilessTD> I'm drunk
[12:02] <MercilessTD> dont mind me
[12:02] <Azathoth> unfortunately
[12:02] <Azathoth> ok
[12:02] <Yourself> so it takes somewhere around 13 seconds to fall 1000 units
[12:02] * Gibri (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) has joined #minecraft
[12:02] <Azathoth> goodnight
[12:02] <Yourself> so the maximum fall speed is at least 77 blocks/second
[12:02] * Subculture (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[12:02] <yoshibot> So, 5 blocks/second to load
[12:02] <Kokopure> I live in that one country that takes up most of north america
[12:02] <Kokopure> you probably haven't heard of it
[12:03] * Subculture (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[12:03] <yoshibot> that's 40kb/s, which might actually be a threat to slower network connections
[12:03] <Subculture> So other people have this problem?
[12:03] <Subculture> When there's a lighting transition, there's a severe drop in FPS?
[12:03] <yoshibot> but from your hard drive it's no problem
[12:03] <yoshibot> the main issue is RENDERING, it seems.
[12:03] <Yourself> ignoring also the time it takes to decompress the block data
[12:03] <yoshibot> negligible
[12:04] <Kokopure> which is why I think blacking out / dying is a great idea
[12:04] <yoshibot> if you can run Minecraft you can decompress 40kb/sec easy.
[12:04] <Kokopure> hey, here's a random question.
[12:04] <Yourself> so why did notch say you can fall faster than the level can load?
[12:04] <yoshibot> i dunno
[12:04] <yoshibot> ask him
[12:04] <Kokopure> if you build a nearly infinitely tall tower
[12:04] <AndrewPH> he said generate
[12:04] <AndrewPH> :1
[12:04] <yoshibot> Generate, yes.
[12:05] <Kokopure> will it try to render the blocks that you can see from the top of the tower once you're up there?
[12:05] <Yourself> ahh, that would make a difference
[12:05] <yoshibot> But nobody asked to have infintely tall mountains.
[12:05] <yoshibot> *infinitely
[12:05] <AndrewPH> well actually a few did
[12:05] <AndrewPH> probably
[12:05] <Kokopure> because wouldn't that, um, make it have to render a level size of......... ridiculous proportions?
[12:05] <yoshibot> Well, I didn't.
[12:05] <Yourself> no, the rendering is still within some 256 meters
[12:05] <yoshibot> Would make a ridiculous tower of babel less impressive
[12:05] <AndrewPH> fuck this shit brb google's dns servers
[12:06] <yoshibot> At that height you would probably hit the skybox. :3
[12:06] <yoshibot> unless it's just always at some constant distance away from you
[12:07] <yoshibot> anyway, it's 3am and I should go get sleep.
[12:07] <AndrewPH> holy goddamn
[12:07] <AndrewPH> google's dns servers are a lot faster
[12:07] <yoshibot> even if it's just a quick nap
[12:07] <AndrewPH> :1
[12:07] <AndrewPH> fuck you qwest and your shitty dns servers that we got for free
[12:07] <AndrewPH> even though it's probably not possible to regulate them
[12:08] <yoshibot> Infinitely deep maps may pose an issue though
[12:08] <yoshibot> or not
[12:08] <yoshibot> depends on if it only loads the blocks you're in and can see
[12:08] * Kokopure hopes for the not
[12:08] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.65.218) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[12:09] <yoshibot> if you fall down a very deep mineshaft, you'll have the same process as you did falling off a very high tower
[12:09] <Yourself> you know what we forgot?
[12:09] <Yourself> we were only loading one column
[12:09] <Yourself> but we need to load all visible columns
[12:10] <yoshibot> most of it would be air or rock you can't see
[12:10] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) has joined #minecraft
[12:10] <yoshibot> and would fall outside of rendering bounds
[12:10] <Yourself> if it's visible, you can see it
[12:10] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.69.96) has joined #minecraft
[12:11] <yoshibot> if you're falling down a mineshaft, you need only load the columns you can see, which may only be the one you're in
[12:11] <Yourself> and dynamic visibility determination like that is difficult
[12:11] <yoshibot> if you're falling off a tower, you're probably too far up to see the ground or anything but the tower
[12:11] <yoshibot> so that's 80kb/sec or more
[12:11] <yoshibot> which is still doable from hard disk
[12:11] <Yourself> no, it's a lot more than that
[12:11] * cosh (x@p5B37AEC5.dip0.t-ipconnect.de) has joined #minecraft
[12:11] <MercilessTD> game design fascinates me
[12:11] <MercilessTD> but this is still doing my head in
[12:11] <yoshibot> if it's just air, there's no point in loading anything
[12:12] <yoshibot> since it's just AIR.
[12:12] <Yourself> yes, that's possible
[12:12] <Yourself> but you need to design these things for worst case performance
[12:12] * Subculture (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[12:12] <Tommerry11> hai, is n otch afk? (space intended, didnt want to inturupt him.)
[12:12] <yoshibot> as for networks, if you've already gone up the tower so far you've already cached those blocks
[12:12] <MercilessTD> (yeah eh is)
[12:13] <MercilessTD> (replying to email i believe)
[12:13] * Gibri (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[12:13] <yoshibot> anyway goodnight
[12:13] <Yourself> also, for the underground part, you'd need some data structure describing what's visible from where

[12:14] <AndrewPH> it does?
[12:14] <Yourself> where windows on the secondary monitor don't update
[12:14] <AndrewPH> doesn't happen to me
[12:14] <Yourself> at least it did when it first came out

[12:18] <Kokopure> Subculture, you like the idea of currency, huh?
[12:18] <LG_Legacy> Given the map structure?
[12:18] <Yourself> with a 128 radius then, worst case, you have to load 64 KB for each one block you fall
[12:18] * Fonzi_254 (chatzilla@CPE-121-214-61-241.lnse4.win.bigpond.net.au) has left #minecraft
[12:18] <LG_Legacy> What would you 'like' to see that is not implanted into the map?
[12:19] <Kokopure> ooh ooh!
[12:19] <Kokopure> lava in floating islands.
[12:19] <Kokopure> that would be nice for me.
[12:19] <LG_Legacy> Heh
[12:19] <Yourself> and the falling speed can get up to around 86 (11.5 seconds to fall around 1000 units at terminal velocity)
[12:19] <LG_Legacy> There use to be lava on surface back in alpha Indev
[12:19] <Kokopure> as it stands most floating islands aren't deep enough for most of the ores to generate
[12:20] <Yourself> so that's over 5 MB/s
[12:20] <Kokopure> unless the level's set to Deep
[12:20] <yoshibot> 5 megabytes/sec?
[12:20] <Subculture> I like the idea of being able to 'buy magic'
[12:20] <yoshibot> worst case there being every block ever filled and visible?
[12:20] <Yourself> that's with 1/4 the visible area that's actually in infdev
[12:20] <Subculture> What's wrong with currency?
[12:20] * chibifsk (chibifs@c-71-238-25-75.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[12:21] <Yourself> how would you determine what is and isn't visible in a dynamic situation?
[12:21] <Subculture> Also, for Survival MP, a Diablo II style trade window would be really nice, almost REQUIRED
[12:21] <yoshibot> still, that'll kill a network but local HD would be just fine
[12:21] <LG_Legacy> Notch what will you be doing about Offensive/improper servers?
[12:21] <Kokopure> Subculture
[12:21] <LG_Legacy> True Subculture
[12:21] <yoshibot> Yourself: calculate that each game tic
[12:21] <Kokopure> I think currency creates a power system that shouldn't exist.
[12:21] <Kokopure> however
[12:21] <Subculture> Don't ask Notch to censor.
[12:21] <Yourself> do you know how difficult visibility determination is?
[12:21] <Yourself> hell, in the source engine that has to be precalculated
[12:21] <Yourself> and it's not even dynamic
[12:21] <Kokopure> if you do want currency, it's easier to add it in after seeing multiplayer work on its own
[12:21] <Subculture> Yourself, what have you done with the Source engine?
[12:21] <yoshibot> you just need like a few line-of-sight checks
[12:21] <Kokopure> than it is to put it in really fast and if it turns out crap, take it out
[12:22] <Subculture> That's true Kokopure
[12:22] <Yourself> a few?
[12:22] <yoshibot> from the player to points around it
[12:22] <Subculture> I'd like to see how multiplayer dynamics work for Minecraft first, before the implimentation of currency.
[12:22] <yoshibot> not a ridiculous amount, but enough
[12:22] <AndrewPH> Yourself, actually there's a way to emulate it in garry's mod in lua without a visleaf
[12:22] <Kokopure> not that I suspect Notch would throw it in immediately after putting together suvival MP
[12:22] <AndrewPH> or precalculations
[12:22] <Yourself> you'd have to do it to every 16x16x16 block withing 256 units of the player
[12:22] <yoshibot> no, not EVERY block
[12:22] <AndrewPH> and by precalculations you know what I meant
[12:23] <yoshibot> if there's a block in the way, you don't need to check each block behind it
[12:23] * chibifs (chibifs@c-71-238-25-75.hsd1.mi.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[12:23] <Subculture> Does anyone know how soon Survival MP is to release?
[12:23] <Yourself> so which blocks are behind it?
[12:23] <Tomcat[TGE]> I like the idea of currency but there would have to a lot of trade going on for currency to be useful, and i don't forsee that happening yet because its still easy for one person to produce every item they want or need by themselves
[12:23] <Kokopure> Subculture, personally I wouldn't bet on before April's end
[12:23] <Kokopure> before May's end seems safe in my own opinion
[12:23] <yoshibot> each block past that block in the line of sight
[12:24] <Yourself> and which part of a 16x16x16 block do you check visibility blocking with?
[12:24] <Kokopure> then again I really don't know what I'm talking about, so, um, form your own opinion
[12:24] <Yourself> if there's a hole in the center, can you rule out that you can't actually see the block behind it?
[12:24] <Subculture> Koko, post in my thread.
[12:24] <Subculture> And I'll blow you.
[12:24] <Subculture> : D
[12:24] <Kokopure> uhwa
[12:24] <yoshibot> depends on the line of sight hitting the 1x1 block in the chunk
[12:25] <Kokopure> which thread, the gold blocks currency thread?
[12:25] <yoshibot> gold needs an actual USE
[12:25] <Kokopure> one, I don't have a forum account, two, I actually don't like the idea of currency
[12:25] <Subculture> Yes
[12:25] <Subculture> Just to get it started
[12:25] <Kokopure> yoshibot, it has a use
[12:25] <Kokopure> looking like ridiculous
[12:25] <Yourself> so we're not at the chunk level anymore
[12:25] <Kokopure> and expensive
[12:25] <yoshibot> but you don't seriously need or can use it
[12:25] <Kokopure> it's showy-offy

[12:25] <yoshibot> Who will you show off to?
[12:25] <Subculture> Right.
[12:25] <yoshibot> The mobs?
[12:25] <Yourself> now we're doing line of sight checks with blocks
[12:25] <Subculture> Gold looks like shit anyways.
[12:26] <Kokopure> well eventually there will be people who you can show it off to
[12:26] <Subculture> The only metal block that looks cool is diamond, and only an idiot would make a block of diamond.
[12:26] <Tomcat[TGE]> i think that iron blocks will end up serving as a form of currency
[12:26] <Yourself> actually, what we're really doing is shadow casting with blocks
[12:26] <Kokopure> anyway you know those piggies are jealous of your gold
[12:26] <yoshibot> Subculture: except for storage sake
[12:26] <Kokopure> don't act like you don't know
[12:26] <Subculture> That's true.
[12:26] <Yourself> also, AndrewPH, what do you mean?
[12:26] <yoshibot> but if you have THAT MUCH diamond gimme some? <:3
[12:26] <Subculture> But who the hell is ever going to get 64 diamonds?
[12:26] <Kokopure> Tomcat[TGE], personally I'd think diamond would serve that purpose.
[12:26] <Subculture> I've only found about 10 diamonds.
[12:26] <Kokopure> that is, if iron ores were pennies than diamonds would be dollars.
[12:26] <Yourself> yes, you could do away with visleafs in the source engine, but they're there for efficiency reasons
[12:26] <AndrewPH> Yourself, There's a way to not render props that are not visible to the player
[12:26] <Subculture> Actually, I found 11, but I stupidly mined the first block with a wood pickaxe
[12:27] <Yourself> to reduce the amount of rendered geometry and overdraw
[12:27] <Tommerry11> anyone know how the lag will be for satalite users? on Infinite maps?
[12:27] <Kokopure> Subculture
[12:27] <Subculture> Kokopure, diamonds would be 1000 dollars.
[12:27] <Tomcat[TGE]> it could, but the problem with diamond is that it is pretty rare.. perhaps diamonds and iron will serve as currency? with diamond obviously being worth much more?
[12:27] <AndrewPH> The people who WERE working on the portalgun for gmod fucked around with it
[12:27] <Kokopure> will a stone pickaxe mine diamond?
[12:27] <Subculture> Diamonds are so fucking rare.
[12:27] <Yourself> how does it work?
[12:27] <yoshibot> Gold is too, to an extent
[12:27] <Kokopure> I'm asking now because I've never seen diamond and I don't wanna screw it up if I do
[12:27] * MercilessTD (MercilessT@115-64-20-105.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[12:27] <yoshibot> Iron is too useful to use for currency
[12:27] <yoshibot> you need it for tools!
[12:27] <yoshibot> and armor!
[12:27] <Yourself> because if it's just LoS checks, that's another reason the whole vis system exists
[12:27] <AndrewPH> Yourself, checks to see if they're visible and then doesn't render them if they aren't
[12:28] <Subculture> Yoshi
[12:28] <Subculture> I have 128 iron.
[12:28] <Subculture> In my save so far.
[12:28] <Subculture> I have more iron than I will ever need.
[12:28] <AndrewPH> One of the earlier ones used traces
[12:28] <Yourself> and also what occluders and visportals are for
[12:28] <AndrewPH> I don't remember what they used after that
[12:28] <Tomcat[TGE]> I've only found diamond once and i ruined it by mining it with a stone pickaxe... it doesn't work
[12:28] <Yourself> the whole point there is that that kind of visibility determination is expensive
[12:28] <Yourself> and it only applies to props
[12:28] <Kokopure> crap, no stone picaxe, huh?
[12:28] <Kokopure> that's all I use really
[12:28] <Kokopure> just so, so easy to make
[12:29] <Yourself> i suppose you could extrapolate it out to brush geometry
[12:29] <Subculture> Does anyone like the 'Flat' maptype?
[12:29] <Yourself> but, as far as i know, brushes don't actually exist in the game
[12:29] <Tomcat[TGE]> nope

[12:35] <Subculture> You still can't do that. That's not how the -source engine works-. Regardless of whether or not you're connected to the internet. Unless you make a physical brush, one that responds to the physics engine.
[12:35] <Subculture> But you can't take a static brush and move it.
[12:35] <Subculture> In game.

[12:53] <Subculture> Serp, shut up.
[12:53] <Subculture> Notch has to be the fastest developing one man dev team I've ever seen.
[12:53] <Subculture> I've never seen anyone pump out a game of this detail this quickly.

[12:55] <Notch> hey thanks :D
[12:56] <Subculture> Just don't got the way of Maddox or I will hunt you down.
[12:56] <serp> Notch devs quickly, but he is probably a human
[12:56] <Tomcat[TGE]> im not sure Furcadia is something you want to be comparing Minecraft with
[12:56] <Tomcat[TGE]> but i get your point and agree
[12:56] <Tommerry11> wow, only noticed the dead bodys in Infdev, AWESOME.

[12:59] <Katsuargi> Hi.
[12:59] <Nesral> Hello Mr Kat
[12:59] <Tommerry11> Hi.
[12:59] <Nesral> Or Mrs?
[12:59] <Katsuargi> Enjoyed the free version so much I bought it right away. xD
[13:00] <Nesral> Same here.
[13:00] <Nesral> Bought Minecraft the first day I found it.
[13:00] <Katsuargi> Really enjoy it. Reminds me a lot of Dwarf Fortress from the perspective of one of the dwarves.
[13:01] <Tommerry11> has anyone else been making abnormally huge roads on infdev, or is that just me?
[13:02] <AndrewPH> you
[13:02] <Katsuargi> Now that I bought it...how do I play indev mode? xD
[13:02] <Tommerry11> ok...
[13:03] <Tommerry11> Kat, http://www.minecraft.net/indev/

[13:04] <Katsuargi> is infdev new? I haven't heard about it.
[13:04] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) Quit (Quit: He??? wants some good ol' fashion cola)
[13:04] <Nesral> indev is the current "stable" version
[13:04] <Nesral> infdev is the infinity demo
[13:04] <Katsuargi> ah.
[13:04] <Nesral> With infinity generated maps
[13:04] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:04] <Nesral> Which is the one which Notch is working right now.
[13:05] <outsomnia> With an absolutely gorgeous terrain generator.
[13:05] <Katsuargi> Is there an offline client by chance?
[13:05] <Katsuargi> Ah, me sees. xD
[13:05] * Griskard (chatzilla@198.067.dsl.syd.iprimus.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[13:05] <Nesral> No.
[13:05] <Nesral> You _need_ to login.
[13:05] <Nesral> For security reason.
[13:05] <outsomnia> But sadly a lack of many essentials, monsters, sand, growing trees, and more if I recall correctly.
[13:05] <Katsuargi> Well, I mean offline as in not browser based.
[13:05] <Nesral> Oh.

[13:06] <Tommerry11> trees grow now, it was in a recent update (week old)
[13:06] <Katsuargi> Infdev or indev?
[13:06] <Tommerry11> infdev
[13:07] <Superwafflez> what they never grow for me
[13:07] <outsomnia> ^
[13:07] <Katsuargi> Is infdev just a more expansive indev?
[13:07] <outsomnia> The saplings I planted when I just started infdev are still there.
[13:07] <Superwafflez> same
[13:07] <Tommerry11> infdev doesnt have monsters yet.
[13:07] <Katsuargi> ah.
[13:07] <Tommerry11> im pretty sure they do for me
[13:07] <Nesral> http://www.crappycomic.com/stuff/Minecraft_indev.zip <-- Indev client
[13:07] <quaxar> No diomond yet
[13:07] <quaxar> Or gold
[13:07] <Superwafflez> is there an infdev client?
[13:07] <outsomnia> Much more expansive with a randomized terrain generator
[13:07] <outsomnia> also
[13:07] <outsomnia> [02:07] <quaxar> No diomond yet
[13:07] <outsomnia> [02:07] <quaxar> Or gold
[13:08] <outsomnia> fak mi pls
[13:08] <Tommerry11> http://minecraft.net/ircrules.jsp
[13:08] <Tommerry11> nesral!
[13:08] <Nesral> Sorry >_>
[13:08] <Nesral> Forgot.
[13:08] <Katsuargi> Is there multiplayer support? I think I might be able to get a few friends to buy/play if we could cohabitat/build a world together.
[13:08] <Superwafflez> Soon
[13:09] <Nesral> There will be
[13:09] <Tommerry11> dont worry. lolz im not even a mod.... never will be.
[13:09] <Superwafflez> A week minimum.
[13:09] <outsomnia> Well we aren't really discussing that client, we're just posting it.
[13:09] <Superwafflez> Need an infdev client tho... get heaps more fps in a standalone...
[13:09] <outsomnia> And either way it still requires you to log in.
[13:09] <outsomnia> Also [02:09] <Superwafflez> Need an infdev client tho... get heaps more fps in a standalone...| YESPLS
[13:09] <quaxar> I just get better fps by pressing f11
[13:09] <quaxar> amazing
[13:09] <Tommerry11> still, you know what Notch would think of that.
[13:09] <quaxar> fullscreen solves alot of problems
[13:10] <outsomnia> What WOULD Notch think of that?
[13:10] * BaldimerBrandyboo is now known as Drakkar
[13:10] <Superwafflez> I dont see why notch doesnt like clients, they probably make his game more attractive to purchase...
[13:10] * ChanServ sets mode +o Drakkar
[13:10] <AndrewPH> ^
[13:10] <AndrewPH> Drakkar will eat your face
[13:10] <outsomnia> I'm not psychic and I've not seen him/seen him talk before today.
[13:10] <Nesral> The client with hacks are a bit minus.
[13:11] <quaxar> I get choppyness when not in fullscreen after I set down a certain amount of torches
[13:11] <quaxar> fullscreen makes the choppyness go away
[13:11] <Katsuargi> A dedicated running process makes things run smoother.
[13:11] <quaxar> Fullscreen solves all sociatal problems
[13:11] <Katsuargi> That one you linked doesn't have hacks does it? I prefer playing it clean.
[13:11] <Tommerry11> nope. no hacks.
[13:11] <Katsuargi> cool deal.
[13:11] <Superwafflez> Even the hack clients have the option to turn them off.

[13:12] <Katsuargi> Hm. Wintergrasp in 5 on my WoW server.
[13:12] <quaxar> their client phones home
[13:12] <Superwafflez> thats a bit devious
[13:12] <Matticus> smart. haha
[13:13] <Matticus> What's everyone's views on flag claims?
[13:13] <Superwafflez> Good, so long as they cant be spammed.
[13:13] <Matticus> I think that they shouldn't be in all servers. Perhaps a decision up to the server creator to decide.
[13:13] <outsomnia> Flag claims, a perfectly acceptable way of sneaking into a base and claiming the throne.
[13:13] <quaxar> what matticus said
[13:14] <quaxar> There is no throne in this game
[13:14] <Matticus> It'd be good to have a sort of, PVP server, you know?
[13:14] <outsomnia> It's a metaphor :|
[13:14] <quaxar> Let the free market decide
[13:14] <quaxar> is what I say
[13:14] <Matticus> lolwhat?
[13:14] <quaxar> property tax peoples miens
[13:14] <outsomnia> I'm to'lly going to be a bandit unless there's some sort of LOLNOGRIEFINGORWEBANYOURPAIDFORACCOUNT rule.
[13:14] <quaxar> on your own server
[13:15] <Matticus> hahaha
[13:15] <quaxar> and delete their flags
[13:15] <quaxar> and thats what admins do
[13:15] <Matticus> xD
[13:15] <quaxar> TAXMANS FREEMARKET SERVER
[13:15] <Matticus> that'd be awesome! hahahaha
[13:15] <Matticus> have lots...
[13:15] <quaxar> every ingame week is tax day
[13:15] <Matticus> 2 iron bars per night for 1 lot.
[13:15] <outsomnia> 2 iron bars?
[13:15] <outsomnia> pretty cheap to me
[13:15] <quaxar> i think he means blocks
[13:16] <Matticus> I think it'd be hard to keep track of weeks
[13:16] <outsomnia> noheclearlysaidbars
[13:16] <quaxar> big ol ioron cube
[13:16] <Matticus> Notch should add sundials! that'd be pretty cool.
[13:16] <outsomnia> Ioron? Iodine? Boron?
[13:16] <Subculture> Fullscreen saves marriages.
[13:16] <outsomnia> But, we can already look at the sun passing by D:
[13:16] <Matticus> Although it would be unrealistic, because suns travel directly above you..
[13:16] <Matticus> true haha
[13:16] <Matticus> I guess it'd be mostly decorative
[13:16] <outsomnia> I say we should implement rowboats once oceans become big enough.
[13:16] <outsomnia> *or seas
[13:17] <quaxar> I think sheep should be able to poop udnerground
[13:17] <Matticus> hell yes!
[13:17] <quaxar> and thats how you get grass
[13:17] <quaxar> underground
[13:17] <quaxar> easier
[13:17] <outsomnia> YESSS
[13:17] <Matticus> row boats for small lakes
[13:17] <outsomnia> sheepoop
[13:17] <Matticus> and ships for oceans
[13:17] <quaxar> outsomnia, its not collectable
[13:17] <outsomnia> I've been doing an awful lot of swimming in infdev so far
[13:17] <quaxar> It just makes grassy grow on dirts
[13:17] <Matticus> poop? haha
[13:17] <Matticus> ahh
[13:17] <Matticus> that would be pretty good
[13:17] <quaxar> baaaaa
[13:17] <quaxar> *poopz*
[13:17] <Matticus> a way to synthesise grass underground
[13:17] <outsomnia> yeah
[13:17] <Matticus> i want to have like
[13:17] <Matticus> a room
[13:18] <outsomnia> for when you don't have a patch of grass for it to spread to other blocks.
[13:18] <Matticus> full of trees and grass and flowers and stuff... underground
[13:18] <Matticus> ahh true
[13:18] <outsomnia> dude
[13:18] <outsomnia> whoa
[13:18] <Matticus> or perhaps it could aid farming
[13:18] <outsomnia> like totally maaan
[13:18] <Matticus> help things grow faster.
[13:18] <Matticus> trees and grain.
[13:18] <Matticus> Also: How could wheat seeds come from grass? :P
[13:18] <outsomnia> Okay quick polle again
[13:19] <outsomnia> Biden or Obama?
[13:19] <Matticus> D= i'm not an american.
[13:19] <outsomnia> D:
[13:19] <outsomnia> goddomot
[13:19] <Matticus> Well, i am half on my father's side.
[13:19] <outsomnia> Throughout the day I've recieved 0 votes either side so far.
[13:19] <quaxar> I think I am a clone of biden, he is just like me.
[13:19] <quaxar> "Support the troops pay more taxes"
[13:19] <Matticus> but his great grandparents were immigrants from sweden.
[13:19] <AndrewPH> outsomnia, 69
[13:19] <outsomnia> Okay, 1 vote for biden then
[13:19] <outsomnia> Biden wins!
[13:20] <Matticus> haha

[13:37] <AndrewPH> I like photobucket, but i heard imgkk is good
[13:37] <quaxar> photobucket bans images after using up too much bandwidth
[13:38] <Tommerry11> ive got photobucket, its ok, but fairly slow upload.
[13:38] <quaxar> photobucket is also annoying when posting images in chats
[13:39] <quaxar> So I prefer imgur

[15:19] <chibifsk> He plans to get out an inf update with monsters, sand, and gravel tonight.
[15:20] <chibifsk> and turned down volcanoes for the time being.
[15:21] <Foshie> Oh ohhhh
[15:21] <The_Rogue> when are caves coming back?
[15:21] <chibifsk> He hasn't said anything else in irc really, except that he was going to eat food and replying to emails.
[15:22] <chibifsk> Directly to me, he told me he'd try to seperate some of the internal color coding so we can configure it eventually. :) That made me happy, because I'm obsessed with making the game monochrome.
[15:22] <The_Rogue> heh
[15:23] <The_Rogue> how would you tell the difference between stone and dirt?
[15:23] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Color coding?
[15:23] <Chocolatey_Syrup> In what capacity, Chibifsk?
[15:23] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Also, what's this about volcanoes?
[15:24] <chibifsk> >_> I hate to post this for like the 11th time. http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=11284

[15:24] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I love the color scheme in the second picture.
[15:25] <chibifsk> There are some colors that are internal to the code right now, font colors, status bars, and a few other bits and peices. He responded by saying he would try, but some things are buried pretty deep.
[15:25] <vede> chibifsk, water and lava are big ones too.
[15:25] <Chocolatey_Syrup> looks pretty good even now, I can only see it getting better. great work thus far.
[15:26] <chibifsk> Yeah. I asked him for a switch between procedural water/lava to textured. He didn't say anything about that, but I'm sure that's one of the more buried things :P
[15:27] <chibifsk> Anyway, it's not a big deal, that's just the only other thing he's said that I know of. :)

[15:28] <Notch> but I like the idea
[15:28] <chibifsk> Welcome back Notch :)

[15:30] <Malikat> oh cool, waking up to see notch. hello
[15:30] <Notch> hey hey
[15:30] <Malikat> almost as awesome as the bbq my dream just ended with
[15:30] <Notch> dream bbq? awesome.
[15:30] <Notch> combining two of the best things evar
[15:31] <Notch> http://www.mojang.com/notch/eoo/EoO.gif
[15:31] <zeroZshadow> xD
[15:31] <Malikat> i know, there were cheeseburgers and applesauce and fresh fruit on little toothpicks
[15:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Notch, when I was playing Dwarf Fortress the other day, I had a thought about block variety. I know you said you don't want multiple blocks that all act the same, but at the same time, you lose a lot of color variety that way, and I know that visual aesthetics are important in a building game like this.
[15:31] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I mean, it's why people use 'baked' smooth stone instead of cobblestone to build things sometimes, even though it uses up fuel and the only benefit is purely aesthetic.
[15:31] <Yohanu> surely you cannot have forgotten beer Malikat
[15:31] <Notch> epic bbq
[15:31] <Yohanu> ya
[15:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> So I had a thought about things like colored stone -- I'll send you an e-mail about it more in-depth, but I think it could add a lot to Minecraft's visual appeal to get into color values.
[15:32] <oldage> going down hills on just cause 2 is so epic
[15:32] <Malikat> yohanu i don't drink, generally.
[15:32] <oldage> especially with bigger vehicles
[15:32] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I don't know if you've considered it, but I'll see if I can write up a little proposal in its favor :3
[15:32] <zeroZshadow> Notch, follow kill ignore xD
[15:32] <Yohanu> Malikat, irrelevant
[15:32] <zeroZshadow> nice gif
[15:32] <Yohanu> bbq without beer is like a pc without a monitor
[15:33] <zeroZshadow> useless
[15:33] <zeroZshadow> or a renderfarm

[15:42] <bildramer> hm
[15:42] <Malikat> that was an amazing pun
[15:42] <Chris220> I've hosted a server, and it's all working good. People can, and have been playing on it. The problem is, my brother (on my LAN), can't connect
[15:42] <bildramer> I just learned 1. if I "learn" programming in school it will be Java
[15:43] <Chris220> Comes up with the red screen suggesting the server is down. Any ideas?
[15:43] <bildramer> and 2. I know practically everything we'll do in the next 2 years

[15:43] <Chocolatey_Syrup> Only now do I remember where I heard the name bildramer

[15:43] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I saw it on a youtube video the other day and I'm like "Why do I know that name?"
[15:43] <bildramer> A A A A etc. etc.
[15:43] <Rithiur_> Chris220: Though unlikely, it's possible that your router can't handle loopback.
[15:44] <Chocolatey_Syrup> and here you are~
[15:44] <ez> here we are
[15:44] <bildramer> also, they're fucking trolling us
[15:44] <bildramer> "blah blah blah *2 hours later* blah blah blah ok, this whole presentation can be downloaded for future reference at our site bye lol"
[15:44] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I saw your name on those Stick Ranger videos, I think.
[15:45] <bildramer> Stick Ranger <3
[15:45] <Chris220> Rithiur_: Possible, but I think I remember hosting LAN matches on another game a while back
[15:45] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I love that game
[15:45] <Chocolatey_Syrup> but it also enrages me
[15:45] <Chris220> Is there an easy way to check if that's the problem?
[15:45] <Chocolatey_Syrup> some of the bosses are just... so impossible.
[15:45] <bildramer> I've hacked its saving
[15:45] <bildramer> like, yeah
[15:45] <Malikat> Chris220
[15:45] <Chocolatey_Syrup> I had a hard enough damn time with my team of 1 priest and 3 snipers, I can't imagine trying to fight some of these things up close, especially since fighters don't have any more defense than mages do
[15:46] <Malikat> i believe the problem is that the server connection routine detects you are accessing the server location from the same IP
[15:46] <Malikat> (because the external ip is the same)
[15:46] <bildramer> that dude is a nice programmer, do everything in base-64, then encode with some weird modulo stuff I cracked then encode with base-64
[15:46] <Malikat> and so it is telling your brother's computer to use 127.0.0.1 instead of the external ip which would work
[15:46] <bildramer> and I wonder how the hell nobody else did it
[15:46] <bildramer> why*
[15:46] <bildramer> just peek at the source, jeez
[15:46] <Malikat> you need to use the manual IP connection URL with your internal network address for the server computer
[15:46] <Chris220> Well, I just told him to ping my PC, and I pinged his. My PC replies to his ping request
[15:46] <Malikat> it would.
[15:47] <bildramer> Java sucks for that reason
[15:47] <Chris220> Oh wait
[15:47] <Chris220> Wrong way round
[15:47] <Malikat> no, ping is irrelevant
[15:47] <Chris220> His PC replies to my ping request
[15:47] <bildramer> so hey, our teacher even told us what we'll have done in 3 months
[15:47] <Chris220> However mine doesn't reply to his request
[15:47] <Chris220> Maybe my firewall's blocking him... I'll see if I can find anything
[15:47] <Malikat> the error is that minecraft.net is telling him to connect to /his/ computer
[15:47] <Chris220> Alright
[15:47] <Chocolatey_Syrup> anyway my point is that Stick Ranger apparently requires insane amounts of grinding or perfect, pre-planned cheap teams because just going in with a team chosen at random will kick your ass
[15:47] <Malikat> thinking that he is hosting the server because he is talking to minecraft.net from the same external ip as your server is
[15:48] <Chris220> Yeah, I understand that
[15:48] <Chris220> I tried that manual IP connection URL, and it
[15:48] <Chocolatey_Syrup> tried so hard to get through it but the game kept kicking sand in my face so I eventually swore it off
[15:48] <Chris220> Came up with something different (sorry for the half-sentence)
[15:48] <Chris220> Let me just find out what it said
[15:48] <Malikat> name not verified, i bet.
[15:48] <Chris220> I think it was, actually
[15:48] <oldage> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mfVb47ucBo&feature=player_embedded#
[15:48] <Chris220> What does that mean?
[15:48] <oldage> I am EXTREMELY amused
[15:48] <Malikat> it's another error
[15:49] <Malikat> you'd need to go into the server properties and set "verify-names" to false
[15:49] <Chris220> Ok, I'll try that

[16:57] <revenant> I personally like the Mac OS, though the hardware is drastically overpriced.
[16:57] <Yohanu> expensive, but apparently very good
[16:57] <Superwafflez> They sure look good though.
[16:57] <Yohanu> i couldn't care less about looks

[16:57] <Yohanu> lol
[16:57] <revenant> The OS is much nicer imo. Besides, I can install linux/windows if I care too.
[16:58] <Yohanu> i tend to use linux or windows for all my needs

[16:58] <Superwafflez> I find linux always has problems for my needs, so I tend to stick to windows.
[16:58] <Marach> ^
[16:58] <eritz> it helps that windows 7 is the best windows version ever
[16:58] <Yohanu> i run linux on my laptop

[16:58] <bildramer> Win 3.1 ftw
[16:59] <Snowman> MAup, atm it isn't possible
[16:59] <Yohanu> lol, windows 7 is far from the best windows os
[16:59] <Superwafflez> 3.1 was THE shit
[16:59] <Superwafflez> in 19
[16:59] <Snowman> Might be in the future though
[16:59] <Superwafflez> 91'
[16:59] <Yohanu> so many people have fallen in to the microsoft propaganda

[16:59] <bildramer> :|
[16:59] <Marach> nobody's told me ANY reasons to switch from xp yet that i would accept
[16:59] <MAup> i nkow its not possible atm, just wondering if its impossible to implement it :)
[16:59] <Yohanu> yeah Marach
[16:59] <eritz> i've personally used 98, 98SE, ME, 2K, XP, vista, and 7
[16:59] <Viral> Marach: To what?
[16:59] <eritz> and 7 is easily the best
[16:59] <Snowman> "I wonder if it is possible to implement an option to turn the blocks, such as "logs" so arms look better or make it look like a tree is lying down?"
[16:59] <gear> directx10 was mostly the reason i was willing

[16:59] <bildramer> oh
[17:00] <Viral> Well worth it tbh.
[17:00] <Marach> "responsive"??
[17:00] <Yohanu> yeah Marach, it's actually correct
[17:00] <Marach> my mouse works fine, as does my keyboard
[17:00] <Yohanu> vista and win7 are more responsive
[17:00] <Superwafflez> Everything just works, no complaints from the OS.
[17:00] <Yohanu> and they tend to last longer
[17:00] <Yohanu> installation wise
[17:00] <gear> it feels more responsive to me as well
[17:00] <Viral> When you plug something in, drivers automatically install. No finding disks / googling everything up.
[17:00] <Yohanu> xp tends to get really slow after a while
[17:00] <Viral> Updates are painless to do.
[17:00] <Marach> Viral: same with xp
[17:00] <Superwafflez> ^
[17:00] <Yohanu> then you reboot and it's fast again
[17:00] <Viral> mine never did
[17:00] <Viral> ;-;
[17:00] <Marach> Yohanu: not for me!
[17:00] <Yohanu> anyways
[17:00] <Superwafflez> I leave my machines on for weeks at a time, so XP got a bit slow.
[17:00] <Yohanu> i love how everyone has bashed vista completely
[17:00] <Viral> yeah i do that a bit.
[17:01] <Yohanu> when xp was even worse at release
[17:01] <Viral> vista is godawful
[17:01] <Marach> Superwafflez: me too. no slowdowms
[17:01] <Viral> it's probably fine now, but it's a bit late

[17:01] <Yohanu> vista sp2 runs better for me than win7
[17:01] <Snowman> Viral, that's my line!
[17:01] <Yohanu> i'm downgrading shortly

[17:03] <Superwafflez> Yeah they recoded a lot of the backend... you'll need DOSbox for a lot.
[17:03] <eritz> yeah, i don't know what you're trying to play

[17:03] <bildramer> haha
[17:03] <Yohanu> actually Superwafflez
[17:03] <eritz> but most of what i'm playing works fine
[17:03] <Yohanu> vista/win7 are nearly the same thing
[17:03] <Yohanu> they have barely changed anything
[17:04] <Yohanu> i'm pretty sure win7 was a marketing trick
[17:04] <Yohanu> and an optimization
[17:04] <Yohanu> that's it
[17:04] <Superwafflez> New UI, some back end code simplification and slimming.
[17:04] <Yohanu> yeah
[17:04] <Viral> more like a gigantic bug fix
[17:04] <Viral> ;D
[17:04] <Yohanu> except, like Superwafflez
[17:04] <Yohanu> said
[17:04] <Yohanu> vista sp2 is on par with win7
[17:04] <bildramer> "Here is some extra advice. BUY TWO BOXES OF CONDOMS. One box she knows about, the other you hide. The box that she knows about, THROW AWAY every time you have sex. Think about it, she could be poking holes in them."

[17:04] <Viral> yeah but it's vista
[17:04] <Viral> shunnnnnnn
[17:04] <Viral> shunnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
[17:04] <Yohanu> microsoft had just gotten such a bad reputation for vista
[17:04] <Yohanu> so they created win7 as a marketing trick
[17:04] <Malikat> Yohanu i'll tell you what i tell everyone who complains about an upgrade or update not doing anything
[17:05] <Raven> o.O
[17:05] <Viral> tbh everyone just go to linux.
[17:05] <Malikat> the point of a good update is to change everything while looking like it changed /nothing/
[17:05] <Raven> wow bildramer xD
[17:05] <Yohanu> i tend to agree Malikat
[17:05] <Yohanu> but
[17:05] <Malikat> .. everything that needs to be changed, i should say
[17:05] <Yohanu> i disagree with this scam
[17:05] <Malikat> how do you know it's a scam
[17:05] <Superwafflez> People get tired with a UI and crave something different.
[17:05] <Malikat> obviously it's very different in the back end
[17:05] <Marach> i dont understand. what's the reason to upgrade?
[17:05] <Viral> it's called visual styles
[17:05] <Viral> :>
[17:05] <Yohanu> "HMM, LETS UPGRADE FROM WINDOWS 6.0 (vista) TO 6.1 AND CALL IT WINDOWS 7 HURR DURR"
[17:05] <Malikat> if it has poor compatibility compared to vista
[17:06] <Marach> Yohanu: 6.9
[17:06] <Yohanu> 6.1*
[17:06] <Malikat> well then i propose vista should be named windows 5
[17:06] <Superwafflez> What's the bet win7 and vista SP2 are the same apart from the UI....
[17:06] <Marach> ...?
[17:06] <Malikat> because xp was just 4.6 or so
[17:06] <Yohanu> Marach,
[17:06] <Seepia> complaining about windows 7 even though it's immensely better than vista
[17:06] <Yohanu> "6.1[1] (build 7600.16385.090713-1255[2])"

[17:07] <Yohanu> memory management rather
[17:07] <Marach> ...what?
[17:07] <Superwafflez> I'm also sick of catering for IE6.
[17:07] <Roadcrosser> back
[17:07] <eritz> XP is EXTREMELY tired
[17:07] <Yohanu> xp is terrible at managing memory over 4gb efficiently Marach
[17:07] <eritz> i used it until about 2009
[17:07] <Marach> what does it mean that an operating system is "dired",
[17:07] <Yohanu> simply because it was made before that was even remotely standard
[17:07] <Marach> tired*
[17:07] <Snowman> XP is OLDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[17:08] <Yohanu> not that old
[17:08] <Malikat> uh
[17:08] <Marach> ha, i wish i had 1 gb of ram
[17:08] <eritz> yes it fucking is
[17:08] <Yohanu> it's the current decade
[17:08] <Snowman> It's like fucking 2002
[17:08] <Yohanu> hence it's not old
[17:08] <Yohanu> :P
[17:08] <Superwafflez> 2001 actually.
[17:08] <Yohanu> old would be 3.1
[17:08] <Snowman> w/e, that's 9 years
[17:08] <Malikat> decade starts in *1
[17:08] <Superwafflez> That's a lot for an OS.
[17:08] <Yohanu> feels like yesterday though
[17:08] <Snowman> 9 years is A LOT in computer science
[17:08] <Yohanu> feels like yesterday though
[17:08] <revenant> anyone want to help me name my custom server?
[17:08] <Yohanu> so from my perspective it isnt old
[17:08] <Yohanu> :P
[17:08] <Malikat> 9 years is a lot on computer science
[17:08] <eritz> look at the computers that PC gamers were running around with in 2001
[17:08] <revenant> written in ObjC...
[17:08] <Marach> revenant: customcraft? :3
[17:08] <eritz> and look at the computers they're running around with now
[17:09] <revenant> ooooh, creative > >...
[17:09] <Malikat> since XP has released, computer power would otensibly have grown by 2^6
[17:09] <Marach> seriously, nothing like that exists yet
[17:09] <eritz> there you have the difference between 2001 and 2010
[17:09] <Superwafflez> XP isnt that good with newer hardware... It's 64 bit version sucks hairy ****** *******

[17:09] <Marach> "old" is no reason to upgrade
[17:09] <Yohanu> i never had trouble with the 64-bit version
[17:09] <Yohanu> and i agree with Marach
[17:09] <Malikat> how about antiquated
[17:09] <eritz> it is if you're upgrading tech in any way
[17:09] <Yohanu> our tv is from 1991
[17:09] <Yohanu> we have no intention of upgrading
[17:09] <Yohanu> unless it breaks down
[17:09] <Malikat> well
[17:10] <Superwafflez> Digital TV kicks ass.
[17:10] <eritz> HD vidya gaems kick more ass
[17:10] <Malikat> TVs don't exactly have new upgrades for hardware
[17:10] <Snowman> My TV is a my computer
[17:10] <Marach> i dont watch tv
[17:10] <Malikat> if you were running the same computerbox as from 2001?
[17:10] <Malikat> then sure, xp is fine
[17:10] <eritz> but nobody is
[17:10] <Yohanu> i agree xp isn't viable for a new computer
[17:10] <Marach> eritz: lmao
[17:10] <Malikat> if you're running a computer with ANY parts from 2006 forward
[17:10] <Yohanu> due to all the unused resources
[17:10] <eritz> seriously, who has a computer for ten years, other than some cheap-ass business?
[17:10] <Malikat> then fuck you, you're just a dinosaur who is afraid of change
[17:10] <Marach> eritz: me?
[17:10] <Yohanu> eritz, me?
[17:11] <Marach> haha
[17:11] <Yohanu> and thousands of others
[17:11] <eritz> i mean, as a MAIN computer
[17:11] <eritz> no upgrades
[17:11] <Yohanu> you know, not everyone needs the latest technology Eric
[17:11] <Marach> i know
[17:11] <Yohanu> eritz*
[17:11] <Malikat> eritz: people who don't use irc
[17:11] <Superwafflez> Average turnaround for a PC is 8 years.
[17:11] <Superwafflez> Sadly.
[17:11] <Snowman> In 9 years, I burn through a computer
[17:11] <Yohanu> i upgrade my main pc regularily
[17:11] <Malikat> who is computer proficient enough to use IRC /AND/ keeps a main computer for 10 years without upgrading
[17:11] <Yohanu> but i still have quite a few old pc's here
[17:11] <Snowman> My previous computer had a GeForce 5200 :3
[17:11] <Superwafflez> New build and laptop every 4 years for me.
[17:12] <eritz> still possessing the computer isn't what i meant

[17:12] <Yohanu> it's like my main project
[17:12] <Marach> eritz: WE KNOW.
[17:12] <Yohanu> eritz, what about people who have no interest in pc hardware at all?
[17:12] <Yohanu> eg my dad?
[17:12] <Superwafflez> Built a PC a few years back... Q6600 + 8800GT combo.
[17:12] <Yohanu> or tons of other people who only use it for some browsing
[17:12] <Malikat> they probably don't give a damn about the difference between xp and 7
[17:12] <eritz> they're still going to have a million dicks' worth of trouble running modern webpages on something from 2001
[17:12] <Yohanu> exactly
[17:12] <Malikat> and are like MY COMPUTER IS FILLING UP AND SLOWING DOWN
[17:12] <Yohanu> that's complete bullshit eritz
[17:13] <eritz> no it's not
[17:13] <Marach> eritz: you'd be surprised
[17:13] <Yohanu> latest firefox runs fine in xp
[17:13] <Marach> yes
[17:13] <Yohanu> chrome does too
[17:13] <eritz> firefox runs great, yeah
[17:13] <eritz> but there are pages that slow my i7 PC down
[17:13] <Yohanu> wtf
[17:13] <Malikat> this conversation is retarded and i think that everyone has lost sight of the point
[17:13] <Marach> eritz: like?

[17:13] <Snowman> So I now use Opera
[17:13] <Yohanu> i havent used firefox since 2.0
[17:13] <Yohanu> became too slow
[17:13] <Yohanu> and bulky
[17:13] <Superwafflez> Using chrome, lightweight and fast.
[17:14] <Yohanu> ye same
[17:14] <Snowman> Too light
[17:14] <Yohanu> i dont use any features at all

[17:14] <Marach> i tried to use chrome once. much slower and crashes often
[17:14] <eritz> there are pages that load slowly, render slowly, and scroll slowly
[17:14] <Yohanu> never happened to me Marach

[17:15] <Yohanu> yes Superwafflez but my point being, not everyone wants to upgrade a pc

[17:25] <Yohanu> lolol
[17:25] <Yohanu> giganews has a daily feed upload of about 4.6tb
[17:25] <Yohanu> not bad
[17:25] <Yohanu> well, they did in 2008
[17:26] <Yohanu> which means it must be higher now as usenet is growing popular again
[17:26] <Superwafflez> 5.2Tb a day for ALtopia D:
[17:26] <zeroZshadow> Notch, wth are MBPs ?
[17:26] <Superwafflez> Macbook Pro's!!
[17:26] <zeroZshadow> ah... apple stuff
[17:26] <zeroZshadow> nvm then
[17:26] <Yohanu> time to start a debate again!
[17:26] <zeroZshadow> neh
[17:26] <Yohanu> apple probably has the most powerful home pc's for sale
[17:26] <Snowman> Marach, Usenet is like torrents but they'relegal and you pay for them
[17:26] <Yohanu> but they aren't worth the price
[17:27] <Marach> pay? ew.
[17:27] <Superwafflez> powerful
[17:27] <Superwafflez> what
[17:27] <Marach> no trial of some sort?
[17:27] <Yohanu> yes Superwafflez
[17:27] <Yohanu> Marach, there is trial
[17:27] <Marach> i wouldnt pay without knowing wtf.
[17:27] <Yohanu> there's plenty of providers
[17:27] <zeroZshadow> powerfull, you kidding ?
[17:27] <Yohanu> i use giganews
[17:27] <Yohanu> they offer 24 hour trial iirc
[17:27] <Yohanu> + $15/month for 2 months
[17:27] <Yohanu> unlimited downloads
[17:27] <Yohanu> unlimited bandwidth
[17:27] <Yohanu> etc
[17:27] <Yohanu> no i'm serious zeroZshadow
[17:27] <zeroZshadow> Yohanu, depends on the news server you use ?
[17:28] <Yohanu> the mac pro pc's has ridiculous specs
[17:28] <zeroZshadow> and not every country allows it
[17:28] <Superwafflez> Find me a mac that beats a Quad SLi GTX480 system with 24gb DDR3 RAM and dual i720's :D
[17:28] <Yohanu> i am talking about giganews
[17:28] <Yohanu> :P
[17:28] <zeroZshadow> Yohanu, give me a good example
[17:28] <zeroZshadow> as specs
[17:28] <Yohanu> no provider sells that Superwafflez
[17:28] <Yohanu> lol
[17:28] <Yohanu> mk, sec zeroZshadow
[17:28] <Superwafflez> It's buildable though
[17:28] <Yohanu> of course
[17:28] <Yohanu> and ridiculously cheaper than apple
[17:28] <Superwafflez> yep
[17:29] <Yohanu> but apple is still the only computer manufacturer that sells pre-made builds with ridiculous specs
[17:29] <Yohanu> for ridiculous prices
[17:29] <zeroZshadow> Yohanu, its not like pre-made is better ?
[17:29] <Superwafflez> Ill find something...
[17:29] <Yohanu> i never said that zeroZshadow
[17:29] <Yohanu> lol
[17:29] <zeroZshadow> i don't have to build the pc myself if i order one :P
[17:29] <zeroZshadow> so i don't see the difference between pre-made and custom
[17:29] <Superwafflez> price
[17:30] <zeroZshadow> its both a pc, just assembled by other people
[17:30] <Superwafflez> a lot.
[17:30] <zeroZshadow> Superwafflez, in case of apple vs pc, that aint true :P
[17:30] <Superwafflez> hmmm
[17:30] <Superwafflez> ?
[17:30] <zeroZshadow> custom pc is still cheaper then a pre-made apple
[17:30] <Yohanu> take this example

[17:34] <Marach> when i choose paypal, it asks me for a credit card anyway.
[17:34] <Yohanu> yes Marach
[17:34] <Yohanu> paypal requires a cc for most transactions
[17:34] <zeroZshadow> apple fanboys are odd
[17:34] <Yohanu> fanboys of anything are odd zeroZshadow
[17:34] <Marach> not for any ive made before
[17:34] <zeroZshadow> credit cards for paypal o.O ?
[17:34] <zeroZshadow> never needed one
[17:34] <Yohanu> especially the nvidia vs ati fanboys
[17:34] <Yohanu> always so funny
[17:34] <zeroZshadow> nvidia >_>
[17:35] <Marach> ati sucks.
[17:35] <zeroZshadow> ati sucks
[17:35] <Notch> ati sucks
[17:35] <Superwafflez> ATI ><>< drivers ><>< suck
[17:35] <Yohanu> i love those arguments because they are completely flawed
[17:35] <zeroZshadow> Notch, long live NVIDIA CUDA !
[17:35] <Notch> i have an ati now, though. Eyefinity
[17:35] <Yohanu> i'm on a nvidia at the moment
[17:35] <Yohanu> but i buy what's best price vs performance at the moment
[17:35] <Superwafflez> Is eyefinity separate desktops or horizontal spanned?
[17:35] <Yohanu> my previous set of graphics cards were 2x ati 4850
[17:36] <Marach> i have an ati now too. it sucks
[17:36] <Notch> you can set up whatever you want
[17:36] <Superwafflez> Oh nice.
[17:36] <Notch> I'm going to have three spanned monitors, for gaming. :D
[17:36] <zeroZshadow> hahaha
[17:36] <Notch> super widescreen in l4d2
[17:36] <Yohanu> lol
[17:36] <Superwafflez> :D
[17:36] <Yohanu> use it in cs and cheat Notch
[17:36] <Yohanu> !
[17:36] <Notch> then the fourth one for bragging
[17:36] <zeroZshadow> Notch, then ATLEAST make minecraft support that !
[17:36] <Notch> of course
[17:36] <Codlike> I have an HD4890, it's pretty good for me
[17:36] <zeroZshadow> i need to earn myself 800 euro's >_>
[17:36] <Codlike> what's so bad about ATi card for you Notch?
[17:36] <zeroZshadow> so i can buy me a Z800 for gaming
[17:36] <Superwafflez> I had three 22" monitors set up on two nvidia cards, which meant I couldnt use the SLI functionality. lol.
[17:36] <Yohanu> haha Notch, my friend has a setup with 14 monitors from the 90's
[17:37] <Codlike> cards*
[17:37] <Yohanu> they are all connected to his main pc that has a bunch of old graphics cards in it
[17:37] <Notch> Codlike: The drivers
[17:37] <Yohanu> all have terminals running 24/7
[17:37] <Marach> is geforce 8xxx/9xxx a good buy?
[17:37] * Roadcrosser is now known as RoAFKcrosser
[17:37] * RoAFKcrosser is now away - Reason : TNG
[17:37] <Yohanu> unix terminals that is
[17:37] <Notch> the hardware is great
[17:37] <Yohanu> i haven't tried the new ati cards yet
[17:37] <Yohanu> the only flaw i found in the drivers for 48xx series was the fan system
[17:37] <Codlike> and the cause of problems in the drivers would be?
[17:37] <Superwafflez> 5 series is power efficient.
[17:37] <Yohanu> you had to set it manually
[17:38] <Yohanu> otherwise it would overheat
[17:38] <Codlike> funny that, my fan reacts to 55'C and sets the fan to near max immediately
[17:38] <Ausfriend> Notch: completely unrelated, but what do you do in ADOM? If i'm lucky and don't get owned by a pack of 40+ wild dogs and make it to the town, theres nothing there ._.

[17:39] <Superwafflez> Minecraft already supports multiple monitors doesn't it? (in a separate maximised client of course)
[17:39] <Yohanu> on my 4850's the fan was at like 10% stock
[17:39] <Marach> Superwafflez: ew
[17:39] <Ausfriend> but west is marauders and bandits
[17:39] <Ausfriend> and trees
[17:39] <Codlike> Actually, I dont think I can set the fan speed manually
[17:39] <Yohanu> but yeah Codlike worst thing about new graphics cards
[17:39] <Yohanu> the damn noise level
[17:40] <Yohanu> this fucking gtx 275 is way too loud when i play games

[17:44] <Yohanu> doesn't interest me much, so no Codlike :P
[17:44] <Marach> qaxie: if the hardware is enough, sure
[17:44] <Codlike> They work, but they're pretty meh, since the force feedback messes with your aim
[17:45] <Codlike> so you'd want to turn it off
[17:45] <Superwafflez> oh =/
[17:45] <Codlike> but not want to turn it off
[17:45] <Codlike> since it's so weir

[18:09] <Foshie> Yohanu, biggest problem there is .. Asian kid does it for 5 bucks and similar compared to a Swede that needs a HIGHER rate
[18:09] <Yohanu> anyone who has a fairly big project Superwafflez
[18:10] <Yohanu> yeah, true Foshie
[18:10] <Superwafflez> A few periodic comments at the start and end of sections would usualy suffice.
[18:10] <FuzzyWuff> documentation often doesn't help, live and easy example does, you learn faster on the way
[18:10] <Yohanu> Superwafflez i'd rather spend 20 minutes reading a well written documentation than experiment for a day in order to get stuff workign
[18:10] <Yohanu> working*
[18:11] * Amatsu (amatsudark@204.237.70.169) has joined #minecraft
[18:11] <Yohanu> and it has nothing to do with the language itself
[18:11] <Superwafflez> AH true
[18:11] <Malikat> the real problem is that those asian rentacoders don't understand the language
[18:11] <Yohanu> it has to do with the software structure
[18:11] <FuzzyWuff> but I do agree everyone learn on different way, some need examples, other need documentation
[18:11] <Malikat> they just use it like you use a car
[18:11] <Superwafflez> So they code stuff the long basic way?
[18:11] <Yohanu> it's pretty much standard in the IT business to provide documentation FuzzyWuff
[18:11] <Yohanu> for any serious company anyways
[18:11] * AcidMan (AcidMan@41.174.3.27) has joined #minecraft
[18:12] <FuzzyWuff> Well yes, there is always a documentation, some just don't read it.
[18:12] <Yohanu> their loss
[18:12] <FuzzyWuff> though, having a code with multiple quotation is always welcome as well.
[18:12] <Yohanu> my old teacher had a great example
[18:13] <Yohanu> he worked for ericsson (now sony ericsson) in the 90's
[18:13] <Yohanu> and he was to maintain the drivers for some modem they had (assembly)
[18:13] * KodaichiZero (silentj43@69.158.42.225) has joined #minecraft
[18:13] <Yohanu> the last employee had not documented it at all
[18:13] <Yohanu> so he ended up rewriting it from scratch
[18:13] <Yohanu> lol
[18:13] <Yohanu> lots of wasted time right there
[18:13] <zeroZshadow> Notch, that buglist you have online, can others submit too it ?

[18:15] <Ten_Tacles> Flat
[18:15] <KodaichiZero> probably beautiful
[18:15] <Yohanu> FuzzyWuff gl convincing companies like ericsson that
[18:15] <Superwafflez> It would look weird D:
[18:15] <zeroZshadow> i think it would be awesome XD
[18:15] <FuzzyWuff> easy to know Zero, think about the game Red Faction
[18:15] <zeroZshadow> ewww
[18:16] <Yohanu> public dev documentation on proprietary software isn't common practice
[18:16] <FuzzyWuff> real time terrain deformation
[18:16] <Yohanu> :P
[18:16] <Superwafflez> Would need grass statics to make it bearable D:

[18:16] <FuzzyWuff> And Yohanu, I am not too fond of Ericsson, but if I had to chose, i would whine for it over an apple product. period.
[18:17] <Yohanu> irrelevant to the discussion though :P
[18:17] <Yohanu> was an example
[18:17] <FuzzyWuff> Exactly.
[18:17] <zeroZshadow> i'd really like some kind of statistics in minecraft

[18:17] <zeroZshadow> if the on exit the game would submit the amount of blocks mined to the site
[18:17] <zeroZshadow> and we kept a sum
[18:17] <FuzzyWuff> But I believe there some wiki'ed product here and there, but a true lack for the coding world.
[18:18] <zeroZshadow> i wonder how much we mine in 1 day
[18:18] <Superwafflez> yeah stats would be nice
[18:18] <Superwafflez> kilometers walked =D
[18:18] <FuzzyWuff> I always heard LUA was easy, but I never foudn any example that was not Garry mod related <.<
[18:18] <zeroZshadow> i think blocks mined will reach critical levels really fast xD
[18:18] <Superwafflez> heh
[18:18] <KodaichiZero> so has nawtch said anything since he came on?
[18:18] <KodaichiZero> if so, then what?

[18:18] <zeroZshadow> he did
[18:19] <Superwafflez> scroll up a long way
[18:19] <zeroZshadow> he found a bug xD
[18:19] <Superwafflez> yeah a missing !
[18:19] <KodaichiZero> I don't have that far of a backlog.

[18:37] <Snowman> So I'd kill them all
[18:37] <bildramer> Shoot the lawyer twice
[18:38] <genida> No no wait, first I'd make Attila and the lawyer fuck Hitler up the ass.
[18:38] <Malikat> hitler would enjoy it

[18:53] <IDTL> >implying mibbit doesn't crash when FF crashes

[18:54] <ZomBuster> I'm pretty low on the addons tough so
[18:54] <Snowman> FF uses 90% of the CPU for me
[18:54] <Kald> So does anyone know what the possible update might entail
[18:55] <ylt> wtf? you have single core? xD

[18:56] <Ausfriend> Man Valve modellers have bad habits.
[18:56] <IDTL> Wait, sand is in infdev now?
[18:56] <zeroZshadow> no there aint
[18:56] <Ausfriend> I've decompiled most of the new models and they are very strangely modelled
[18:56] <IDTL> well shit

[18:57] <zeroZshadow> its not like thats allot of waiting
[18:57] <IDTL> five days is a long time man
[18:57] <Ausfriend> THey modelled it on a rotated y axis, so it's never straight unless you tilt your viewport
[18:57] <bildramer> yeah
[18:57] <IDTL> That's as many as 5 ones
[18:57] <zeroZshadow> take an example of the pandora people
[18:58] <ZomBuster> Ausfriend don't you think that's just a side effect of the decompiling?
[18:58] <zeroZshadow> they wait for 1.5 years for it
[18:58] <zeroZshadow> and they pay allot more :P
[18:58] <Ausfriend> Pretty sure it isn't.
[18:58] <IDTL> I've heard of decompiling doing that
[18:58] <ZomBuster> they always are weirdly rotated for me
[18:58] <IDTL> On the TF2 subforum on Facepunch
[18:58] <bildramer> not a coincidence
[18:58] <Ausfriend> oh right
[18:58] <bildramer> issue solved

[19:14] <CruelNoise> how's it goin'?
[19:14] <Drewseph> this thing would sell like hot cakes
[19:14] <Malikat> Minecraft 360 lol
[19:14] <CruelNoise> oh, hi
[19:14] <Drewseph> esp as DLC
[19:14] <Yohanu> it would be quite a lot of work Drewseph
[19:15] <IDTL> Could make some good money on the 360 or PSN
[19:15] <CruelNoise> i was thinking DS for minecraft
[19:15] <Drewseph> YEs me too
[19:15] <Drewseph> DS all the way
[19:15] <IDTL> Would have to be toned down a lot
[19:15] <Drewseph> wonder what Notch thinks about that thought
[19:15] <outsomnia> I don't think the usual MW-2 fans will appreciate MC, also the controls would be a big bother.
[19:15] <Yohanu> the 360 and PSN does not support java natively so yeah
[19:15] <ZomBuster> just change the controls a bit
[19:15] <Yohanu> would have to port it to a diff language
[19:15] <ZomBuster> and add a cover system
[19:15] <Malikat> i could see it on the DS as multiplayer only
[19:15] <Malikat> using distributed computing
[19:15] <ZomBuster> also remove building-mining
[19:16] <ZomBuster> and add guns
[19:16] <Malikat> ^

[19:52] <Splatticus> I love people who are like "Blah blah blah hate DSi XL it's too big whine whine whine, not portable anymore, defeats the purpose, bitch bitch bitch, it won't fit in my pocket.'
[19:52] <Splatticus> I'm like.
[19:52] <Splatticus> "Get bigger pockets, stfu nub."

[19:52] <Splatticus> iPad is even worse than DSi XL, apparently, rofl.

[19:54] <Snowman> go to the woods, pick up a stick
[19:55] <KodaichiZero> I think it would be cool the play a pokemon game from a different perspective
[19:55] <KodaichiZero> as an established antagonist, like one of your rivals
[19:55] <KodaichiZero> I prefer playing already-made stories, rather than "writing your own"
[19:56] * laCour|ZzZ is now known as laCour
[19:56] <KodaichiZero> everyone knows pokemon is linear, it should avoid pretending that it isn't
[19:56] <Splatticus> Hey, it's Notch! o.o Hi Notch!
[19:57] <Splatticus> It's non-linear in the sense that you can go back to previously visited locations.
[19:57] <KodaichiZero> He's currently eating Yakiniku/solving RAM issues
[19:57] <KodaichiZero> true
[19:57] <Splatticus> A linear game is like HL2. You can't go all the way to Black Mesa East, toss a ball with Dog, then manually go back all the way to Dr. Kleiner's lab and play with his mini-teleporter.
[19:58] <KodaichiZero> I'd sacrifice character customization to give the main character some dialogue though
[19:58] <Splatticus> You're breaking tradition, then.
[19:59] <Splatticus> J-games have a notorious long line of silent heroes.
[19:59] <KodaichiZero> yeah
[19:59] <Splatticus> Link is pushing it, with his HYAAAH
[19:59] <KodaichiZero> lol now that I think about it
[19:59] <Splatticus> And his.. 'UH-HHH!"
[19:59] <KodaichiZero> that's probably why I'm not interested in The Crystal Bearers
[20:00] <Splatticus> I personally like it.
[20:00] <Splatticus> Especially when the characters that do talk talk shit because you never say anything.
[20:00] <KodaichiZero> lol yeah true
[20:01] <Splatticus> There
[20:01] <Splatticus> There's a charm to it.
[20:01] <KodaichiZero> it's funny when people make note of the fact you're silent
[20:01] <Splatticus> Dialogue can often get in the way, too.
[20:02] <KodaichiZero> aight brb

[21:36] <Vicrry> And not too far off that bottom, there's a cave that goes down to the admincrete bottom I just dug into

[21:37] <Vicrry> So far anyway, apparently diamonds hang out near the bottom
[21:37] <Kald> What is this, indev?
[21:38] <Vaugher> I got lucky. I spawned a huge, floating deep map and found 15 diamonds outside my spawn point.
[21:38] <bildramer> whoa
[21:38] <Malikat> rofl what
[21:39] <Vaugher> And like... twenty gold.
[21:39] <Vaugher> Some coal. Very little iron, though.
[21:39] <Vicrry> indev!
[21:39] <Kald> Nice.
[21:39] <bildramer> *wonders what Notch is doing*
[21:40] <Kald> The irony is that you couldn't mine them until you found iron, huh
[21:40] <Vaugher> Yea.
[21:40] <Vaugher> I found enough for a few picks, though.
[21:40] <Vaugher> But I need more.
[21:40] <Ten_Tacles> Bildramer, being afk?
[21:40] <Vaugher> Hoping I'll find some higher up.
[21:40] <bildramer> perhaps
[21:40] <Vaugher> Making a big tower from top to bottom of the map, going to go straight through the islands.
[21:40] <Vicrry> I has filled six large chests with cobblestone so far :)

[21:47] <Malikat> hush fool
[21:48] <Kald> Aaaah, I love iron blocks.
[21:48] <Drewseph> he should only release the beta candidate for testing
[21:48] <Kald> Their luster, steely gleem!
[21:48] <Malikat> he should update when he feels that an update is ready
[21:48] <Ten_Tacles> There are caves already?
[21:48] <Kald> The sound they make underfoot!
[21:48] <Ten_Tacles> I thought so.
[21:48] <Kald> There ain't
[21:48] <Drewseph> no caves

[22:03] <Kald> So
[22:03] <Kald> Did anybody else hear Notch is gonna introduce slimes?
[22:03] <bildramer> weird
[22:03] <Malikat> yes.
[22:04] <bildramer> I'll need another client, dammit
[22:04] <Kald> I wonder if they'll like
[22:04] <Kald> Dissolve blocks.
[22:04] <Kald> Maybe be acidic.
[22:05] <bildramer> yay
[22:05] <Drewseph> Hey Notch, hows the bug fixing going?
[22:05] <rbos> slower every time someone asks him that, I assume
[22:06] <Kald> Hey guys
[22:06] <Kald> In this http://yfrog.com/5mcave11p pic, how do you get all those...well, numbers, in the corners?
[22:06] <Kald> Also, do they mean coordinates?
[22:06] <Malikat> no, they are part of the framerate display
[22:06] <Malikat> and they are debug information for n-dogg's purposes
[22:07] <Kald> Aha
[22:07] <Vicrry> BRB - must push a pig into the lava
[22:07] <Malikat> c = chunks visible, f = excluded by not being in the fustrum, o = excluded by occlusion
[22:07] <Malikat> i believe.
[22:07] <bildramer> n-dogg
[22:07] <bildramer> lol
[22:07] <Malikat> i might be saying fustrum totally wrong. the cone of vision.
[22:07] <Kald> But isn't there some sort of entity counter, too?
[22:07] <Kald> As in mobs?
[22:08] <bildramer> sure there is
[22:08] <Malikat> e = entities visible / total entities
[22:08] <Malikat> b = idk, i = idk
[22:08] <Malikat> p = particles
[22:08] <Malikat> t = uh lol
[22:08] <Malikat> L = lighting updates
[22:08] <Kald> Huh. Alright.
[22:09] <Kald> Is there some way to display that, in /indev/ mode?
[22:09] <ZomBuster> settings > show fps
[22:10] <Kald> Hehe, indev mode: Enetities: 1/1
[22:10] <Vicrry> yey
[22:10] <Vicrry> Killed a pig with a porkchop :P
[22:10] <Marach> let me guess, the player? :D

[22:11] <Kald> Argh. I thought I found iron, and it's GOLD.
[22:11] <Malikat> the player is an entity
[22:12] <bildramer> oh shit get the fuck out of here
[22:12] <Malikat> dead bodies are also entities
[22:12] <Vicrry> I watched a pig jump into the pit on its own. It died :P
[22:12] <rbos> I thought pigs wouldn't do that

[23:15] <LuciferZ> Someone should make a game called "Go play outside" and all it is, is a procedurally generated terrain to infinity. No plot, no physics beyond water and wind, no characters or interaction. Just awesome graphics and a great generator.
[23:15] <Eric> that would be boring
[23:15] <LuciferZ> Hell yeah
[23:15] <vurtual> and random objects
[23:15] <vurtual> but really realistic terrain
[23:16] <LuciferZ> Which is why it's called "Go play outside"
[23:16] <LuciferZ> Because that shit is boring.
[23:16] <TestDummy> Make it interesting.
[23:16] <sppt> >implying the outside is boring
[23:16] <vurtual> So you could go sprint through a forest, or go out during winter and sled.
[23:16] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[23:16] <LuciferZ> Seriously though, it would be boring, but it's really more electronic art than game.
[23:17] <Sopot> wait
[23:17] <Sopot> couldn't we do that in minecraft already?
[23:17] <Rooster> Electronic arts
[23:17] <LuciferZ> Sort of.
[23:17] * Sopot is now known as outsomnia
[23:17] <Rooster> If you have firefox, spell check infdev
[23:17] <LuciferZ> But minecraft, while pretty, is not as pretty as what I'm describing
[23:17] <Rooster> first word will be infidel
[23:17] <outsomnia> Why go play outside when we're going to have all that implemented in MC anyways?
[23:18] <LuciferZ> Weird.
[23:18] <vurtual> You know how fun running around in some games is
[23:18] <vurtual> It could be MULTIPLAYER so you could RUN AROUND WITH YOUR FRIENDS
[23:18] <Rooster> But seriously, MP survival is doomed
[23:18] <vurtual> You could TIE A ROPE TO A TREE and SWING INTO A POND
[23:18] <vurtual> Then RACE BICYCLES
[23:18] <outsomnia> but but
[23:18] <LuciferZ> FUCK THAT
[23:18] <LuciferZ> I can do that shit in real life
[23:18] <vurtual> And since it's a videogame YOU COULD JUMP OFF A CLIFF AND DO BACKFLIPS THEN RESPAWN
[23:19] <vurtual> or GET A HELICOPTER AND MAKE A CITY MADE OUT OF STACKED HELICOPTERS
[23:19] <Vicrry> :( - the pig I shoved didn't fall into the pit and die, it hit the staircase halfway down
[23:19] <outsomnia> Isn't that Minecraft?
[23:19] <vurtual> or cheaper boxforts
[23:19] <LuciferZ> I want a game that is basically a landscape painting that I can move and change with simple controls and wandering.
