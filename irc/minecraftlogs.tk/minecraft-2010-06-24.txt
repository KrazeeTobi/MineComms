[0:07] * Weltschmerz (Weltschmer@240-155-150-83.kiruna.adsl.linnea.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:07] <liq3> Trolling is being disruptive intentionally - e.g. starting arguments for the hell of it, and playing both sides to make them last longer.
[0:07] <Visiiri> Fucking russians
[0:07] <Marach> i don't check for updates, i have RSS 1337faec.jpg
[0:07] <KinoftheFlames> trolling: intentionally pissing other people off by telling lies for personal amusement
[0:08] <Visiiri> That's what I did :D
[0:08] <vurtual> no trolling
[0:08] <vurtual> is making people rage

[0:09] <Visiiri> what the hell
[0:09] <Visiiri> how do anagrams work D:
[0:09] <liq3> I think this wins "troll: angling by drawing a baited line through the water".
[0:09] <ZarroTsu> I can't believe I'm saying this: I ran out of stone building my railroad
[0:09] <liq3> Pretend "water" = "internet"
[0:09] <Snowman> and line is text
[0:09] <Snowman> And the bait is spam
[0:09] <Snowman> And the angling is trolling
[0:10] <Snowman> and the troll is you
[0:10] <ZarroTsu> and 4 chan is a public washroom
[0:10] <Kokopure> ZarroTsu
[0:10] <Kokopure> how in the hell did you run out of stone
[0:10] <liq3> Visiiri: you rearrange the letters.
[0:10] <ZarroTsu> exactly Koko
[0:10] <ZarroTsu> I have no idea
[0:10] <Kokopure> I literally throw my stone in the lava pit
[0:10] <liq3> I'd run out of stone easily... I barley have 3 piles of it.
[0:10] <Marach> Mr Pour sneaks.
[0:10] <Kokopure> I have two double chests with nothing but stone
[0:10] <ZarroTsu> I'll need to mine more 8[
[0:10] <ZarroTsu> well
[0:10] <Marach> Ms*
[0:11] <ZarroTsu> my railroad is huge mind you
[0:11] <rob`> it's possible to make an infinite-cobblestone lava fountain
[0:11] <Marach> Mrs*
[0:11] <Marach> kfuc
[0:11] <rob`> but I'd rather mine it
[0:11] <ZarroTsu> http://i50.tinypic.com/2s16po4.png <- This is only 1/3 the road I have
[0:11] <liq3> ZarroTsu: uh... It only takes 1 stone per track, and 1 extra per level change...
[0:11] * laCour is now known as laCour|Offline
[0:11] <liq3> Unless you're building walls.
[0:11] <ZarroTsu> I've used over 200 track blocks
[0:11] <liq3> that's 200 stone if you remine the level change blocks.

[0:13] <liq3> Keiya: i know. :D
[0:13] <Snowman> liq3, AudioSurf does it just right
[0:13] <liq3> But it would be one hell of a game if they did.
[0:13] <Keiya> Honestly, it's damn impressive they do as well as they do
[0:13] <liq3> Snowman: psh no.

[0:13] <Visiiri> Snowman -> Man Owns
[0:13] <Visiiri> how can you beat that
[0:13] <liq3> Audiosurf takes too much concentration to play non-badly.
[0:13] <Marach> woah. "Desperation = A rope ends it"
[0:13] <Snowman> Clint Eastwood = Old West Action
[0:14] <Keiya> If you really want it to be correct, you have to give the computer a definition of the music, not just the final audio
[0:14] <Snowman> Snowman owns man(kind)
[0:14] <Snowman> liq3, lrn2focus
[0:14] <Keiya> oh... you mean the gameplay, not the analysis >_>
[0:14] <liq3> Keiya: hrm... Maybe.
[0:14] <liq3> Snowman: no I mean you can't enjoy the music while playing audiosurf.
[0:14] <liq3> :P

[0:34] <blaster> A Notch is one of the Minerz (Minecraftian) programmers, Awesome people, beard growers, and gamers who programmed and created wide areas of Infdev from the late twentieth to the early twenty-first century. These Minermen used their famed keyboards to travel as far east as Java and the Flash in king.com, and as far west as C++, Lua, and HTML. This period of Notch expansion ? known as the Notch Age ? forms a major part of the Modern history of Minecraftia

[0:51] <blaster> Its those eyes
[0:51] <Zev> I Love life
[0:51] <vurtual> put samus in it, or something silly
[0:52] <blaster> the more you look at them, the more it looks like he has an evil plan
[0:52] <vurtual> like a helicopter
[0:52] <blaster> Someone on the forums will proberbly point it out
[0:52] <Kodaichi> I liked notch's latest update
[0:52] <Kodaichi> blog update*
[0:53] <Koko|BUSY> ...
[0:53] <Koko|BUSY> hey.
[0:53] <Kodaichi> i personally would prefer a smoother framerate
[0:53] <Koko|BUSY> question before I really get busy.
[0:53] <blaster> Smooth is better
[0:53] <LG_Legacy> CSS Beta is over
[0:53] <Koko|BUSY> who here said they could make infinite signs?
[0:53] <LG_Legacy> CSS Is nmow being updated wit hthe beta
[0:53] <Koko|BUSY> by placing a sign on top of the world?
[0:53] <blaster> because no matter how good your pc is the choppy one will be horrible
[0:53] * Roni (kvirc@p54AB6004.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft
[0:53] <Koko|BUSY> whoever they are, I owe them an apology for calling them a liar ._.;;
[0:53] <Koko|BUSY> there are indeed infinite signs. it's just not labeled in any way.
[0:53] <vurtual> THE BETA IS OVER?
[0:54] <LG_Legacy> Yep, CSS Is now CSS:Beta
[0:54] <Kodaichi> Let's compromise with a chunk size 24!
[0:54] <vurtual> I have it in my download list though
[0:54] <blaster> Everyone make their own decapitated notch head related gif avatar
[0:54] <vurtual> o_o
[0:54] * Kodaichi watches as the nerds start to hurl bricks
[0:54] <Roni> well i wanted to ask notch how it looks with chunk size of 8 ^^
[0:54] <vurtual> chunk size of 1
[0:54] <vurtual> by 1
[0:54] <vurtual> by 83
[0:54] * blaster runs for the creeperproof bunker
[0:54] <vurtual> do not question me
[0:54] <blaster> ...?
[0:55] <blaster> It would need to be
[0:55] <Kodaichi> probably really smooth, bt very low fps. likely not worth considering
[0:55] <blaster> 1x1x83x128
[0:55] <Koko|BUSY> question.
[0:55] <Koko|BUSY> when Notch says...
[0:55] <Koko|BUSY> "With 16 chunk size, the maximum frame rate is almost half that of 32"
[0:55] <blaster> 1 time, thats normal
[0:55] <Koko|BUSY> "almost half of 32".
[0:55] <Koko|BUSY> is that more or less than 16 :x
[0:55] <blaster> Yeh
[0:55] <Roni> i like more smoother gameplay i dont mind if i only have 20 fps as long its looks smooth and it plays like this
[0:55] <Kodaichi> well, gotta go for a bit
[0:55] <blaster> Same
[0:55] <Snowman> Half of that when using 32
[0:55] <Kodaichi> I'll be back at some point
[0:56] <blaster> how about some option for it
[0:56] <Snowman> Not half of 32
[0:56] <bildramer> if I launch the GIMP my CPU will fail and overheat
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> right, right.
[0:56] <Askee> Stupid obsidian >:(
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> what I mean to say.
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> does he mean...
[0:56] <bildramer> but I can't make a GIF else
[0:56] <bildramer> whatever
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> it's greater than half the framerate?
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> or less than half the frame rate?
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> I don't get what he means by "almost half".
[0:56] <Conundrumer> around
[0:56] <bildramer> I would really prefer the second option
[0:56] <Ominus> anything above 30 fps is just wasted frames that cost movie makers billions
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> so would I.
[0:56] <Roni> Koko|BUSY: i want smooth gamyplay thats what i care about
[0:56] <bildramer> smooth > fast
[0:56] <Conundrumer> doesn't really make a difference
[0:56] <Roni> Ominus: right
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> agreed, I don't need mega awesome frame-rate.
[0:56] <bildramer> especially for slowass computers
[0:56] <Koko|BUSY> as long as it's smooth.
[0:56] <bildramer> hm
[0:57] <bildramer> good night
[0:57] <KinoftheFlames> well i average 100 fps so i hope it doesn't drop too much D:
[0:57] <Koko|BUSY> I'm not playing Call of Duty here.
[0:57] <Snowman> Read as: "With 16 chunk size, the maximum frame rate is almost half that of the maximum frame rate with 32 chunk size."

[0:57] <Koko|BUSY> double-facepalm
[0:57] <Roni> lol
[0:57] <KinoftheFlames> Roni: oh ok. i just dont want it to drop to like 30 fps when its fine now :P
[0:57] <vurtual> blaster does not get it
[0:57] <liq3> TVs aren't the same as moniters. TVs are much larger and generally more blurry, so low framerate is much less noticiable. The much higher sharpness of moniters is waaaaaaaaaay more noticable. :p
[0:57] <vurtual> anyways
[0:58] <vurtual> nobody 1-ups my pedostare visor avatar?

[0:58] <vurtual> it takes a whole TWO MILLISECONDS to draw the next frame, askee
[0:58] <liq3> Askee: Dang, that sucks. I'm getting 43,000 fps. :D
[0:58] <blaster> nobody has even seen it
[0:58] <Askee> nuuuu
[0:58] <Roni> KinoftheFlames: well actually your eye only catches ~25 fps so as long its over 25 everythign should look smooth
[0:58] <blaster> hey er
[0:58] <liq3> Roni: No.
[0:58] <vurtual> THAT ONLY 43 FRAMES PER MILLISECOND LIQ3
[0:58] <blaster> quatroking could I download that swf loop
[0:58] <liq3> It's been proven to be incorrect.
[0:58] <blaster> and put it on my phone?
[0:58] <vurtual> roni
[0:58] <Quatroking> yes you can sir
[0:58] <vurtual> we have no "framerate"
[0:58] <KinoftheFlames> oh no. its a lot higher than that roni. I can tell up to 50 fps diff at least
[0:58] <blaster> How though?
[0:59] <vurtual> our eyes see light as it comes in
[0:59] <liq3> The eye can notice a difference between 90 and 120 easily.

[0:59] <Conundrumer> I've grown used to having around 10 fps
[0:59] <liq3> Roni: Because you don't play games at 125?
[0:59] <liq3> :P
[1:00] <liq3> Also having your FPS higher then your moniter's refresh rate is pointless anyway.
[1:00] <Askee> ^
[1:00] <KinoftheFlames> roni: 30 fps is a benchmark for "non shitty" fps where it stutters. But once you view it in 60 fps, it looks vivid
[1:00] <vurtual> oh no
[1:00] <vurtual> a flash flood warning
[1:00] <liq3> Just results in tearing if it's absurdly higher. :/
[1:00] <vurtual> :(

[1:01] <Roni> KinoftheFlames: actually i have never seen diferrence betweeen 30 or 60 fps jsut 20 and 30
[1:01] <liq3> KinoftheFlames: uhhhh. Vysnc lines up the game's drawing with your moniters refreshing.

[1:13] <vurtual> it's still addictive
[1:13] <vurtual> no matter what anyone says
[1:13] <bildramer> ok
[1:13] <bildramer> more dangerous than nicotine?
[1:13] <TrueWolves> vurtual is preaty much right.
[1:13] <TrueWolves> No less

[1:14] <vurtual> weed is pretty harmless though

[1:14] <vurtual> you'd have to smoke like, hundreds of joints
[1:14] <bildramer> ok
[1:14] <TrueWolves> blaster, the smoking prcess does, the weed does not.
[1:14] <vurtual> and then that'd be carbon monoxide poisoning
[1:14] <blaster> vurtual, brain damage
[1:14] <blaster> It happens quite slow though
[1:14] <Armonte> Was there an update today
[1:14] <vurtual> THC literally doesn't hurt you.
[1:14] <vurtual> It does nothing, physically, to hurt you.
[1:14] <bildramer> so this author is saying it's over 4 times more dangerous than nicotine

[1:14] <TrueWolves> bildramer, that's false.
[1:14] <Vis{anus|head}> bildramer: that's probably statistically
[1:14] <Vis{anus|head}> due to accidents related to the drugs
[1:15] <Roni> bildramer: uhm so whay are you asking if your not planning to smoke one?
[1:15] <vurtual> not even that, vis
[1:15] <blaster> nicotine is very deadly

[1:15] <vurtual> not even that.
[1:15] <liq3> what does THC do?
[1:15] <bildramer> :(
[1:15] <vurtual> bildramer well the coolest things I got were two lego tecnic models
[1:15] <blaster> but its in small quantities, weed is... well... 50% weed coz they throw other shit in

[1:16] <Koko|BUSY> question for you all
[1:16] * Vis{anus|head} goes to post his infdev map in the skins forum
[1:16] <Koko|BUSY> should I upload it now?
[1:16] <LG_Legacy> ZarroTsu I couldn't find a copy of it
[1:16] <Koko|BUSY> or should I wait for some mobs to wander in, as sort of a "highlight reel"?
[1:16] <bildramer> I would have over 1000 euros that have been used on useless stuff I may just throw away
[1:16] <TrueWolves> THC also effects short term memory, it boosts it even... the problem is like anything that boosts anything, you can become relient on it if over used (and this is why heavy pot smokers have not the best memory)
[1:16] <bildramer> a microscope
[1:16] <bildramer> what the fuck am I supposed to do with it?

[3:03] * TkTech|Away is now known as TkTech
[3:04] <Kokopure> well.
[3:04] <Kokopure> I didn't show myself digging the hole.
[3:04] <Kokopure> but I did give the dimensions for said hole.
[3:04] <Kokopure> I also didn't show myself building the inner glass "cage". but, again, I gave the dimensions for it.
[3:04] <Kokopure> I did show myself filling it up with water
[3:04] <Kokopure> because there's a very particular way you must do it, in order for it to work.
[3:05] <blaster> for what to work
[3:05] <Kokopure> so no, it's not just a showoff.
[3:05] <Kokopure> blaster, for the current to work
[3:05] <Kokopure> if you do it wrong, there won't be enough water current for it to be an effective mob-trapper.
[3:05] <Kokopure> also, I learned something.
[3:06] <Kokopure> pigs and sheep struggle more underwater than spiders do.
[3:06] <Kokopure> that's why spiders suck.
[3:06] <Kokopure> they're just like "ohp, I'm underwater."
[3:06] <Kokopure> and then
[3:06] <Kokopure> because they're only one block high...
[3:06] <Kokopure> if you don't have countermeasures, they slip under your water-opening.
[3:06] <ZaxKellens> ...
[3:06] <ZaxKellens> So you didn't really show anything...
[3:06] <Kokopure> countermeasures are easy, though. I do show those off.

[3:09] <Kokopure> so, the songs are
[3:09] <Kokopure> Ievan Polkka
[3:09] <Kokopure> Everlasting Love (from We Love Katamari)
[3:09] <Kokopure> and then Caramelldansen (REDALiCE mix)
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> ...REDALiCE's mix? <.<
[3:09] <ZaxKellens> Not speedy?
[3:09] <Kokopure> is that bad?
[3:09] <Kokopure> well
[3:09] <Kokopure> it's more the mix of the speedy mix.
[3:10] <Kokopure> it's like a mix of a mix.
[3:10] <Kokopure> personally, I like the unaltered version just fine.
[3:10] <ZaxKellens> <.<
[3:10] <Kokopure> Caramell is a fantastic singer.
[3:10] <ZaxKellens> Sure
[3:10] * Kokopure especially likes Ooa Hella Natten because it's about a creepy stalker
[3:10] <Kokopure> so is Explodera, sort of.
[3:10] <Kokopure> she seems to sing about creepy stalkers a lot.

[3:19] <Kokopure> "SMP Realistic Texture Pack"
[3:19] <ZaxKellens> Nevah
[3:19] <Kokopure> what does the SMP there mean
[3:19] <Perry> SMP's realistic?
[3:20] <Perry> it's cool. I don't use the terrain png, only the GUI
[3:20] <Perry> you probably saw it in my strea,
[3:20] <Kokopure> the dude who got replied to by Notch as "nope." said something about it.
[3:20] <Perry> *stream
[3:20] <Cial> stop not understanding the space/time continuum
[3:20] <Keiya> I also want, um, switches
[3:20] <Kokopure> Perry, is that the one where grass is darker
[3:20] <Keiya> And diagonal tracks maybe
[3:20] <Kokopure> and your sword is a hammer?
[3:20] <Perry> I believe so
[3:20] <Keiya> but at least switches
[3:20] <Perry> pretty much everything is darker
[3:20] <slowriot> screenshot?
[3:20] <Keiya> so I can do insane layouts :P
[3:20] <Adam01> why are mountains red in omen?
[3:21] <Perry> yes, the stone sword is a hammer

[3:21] <ZaxKellens> Iphone gay
[3:21] <Kokopure> ur a nub
[3:21] <gear> pfft
[3:21] <Pikablu> boring
[3:21] <gear> why
[3:21] <ZaxKellens> Gear is a supernoob
[3:21] <Kokopure> okay, hang on.
[3:21] <gear> all i hear is hatin'
[3:21] <Perry> would you stop now
[3:21] <Perry> annoying.
[3:21] <Kokopure> let's at least hear the reasons
[3:21] <Kokopure> gear, why did you purchase an iPhone4?
[3:21] <gear> for?
[3:22] * Keiya mehs at the iPhone.
[3:22] <TheMilkMan> lol 3d anaglyph too bad it hurts my eyes DX but it looks so cool
[3:22] <gear> because im a part time app developer
[3:22] * ZaxKellens stabs TheMilkMan.
[3:22] <Pikablu> get 3d glasses
[3:22] <slowriot> TheMilkMan: do you have 3d glasses?
[3:22] <gear> and i have a sweet att plan and there are no decent android phones for att
[3:22] <Perry> TheMilkMan, you know you're supposed to have red/cyan filters... right?
[3:22] <Keiya> My reasons for wanting something else are very nerdy though: I like being in control.
[3:22] <Kokopure> gear, why is the App Store more enticing than the Android Market for you?
[3:22] <Kokopure> ... :|
[3:22] <Kokopure> oh.
[3:22] <TheMilkMan> I have them
[3:22] <Kokopure> you're stuck in by your plan.
[3:22] <Kokopure> for how long?
[3:22] <TheMilkMan> Well they're either red blue or red cyan
[3:22] <Kokopure> because we have AT&T, and we're getting out this year.
[3:22] <gear> as long as i have this 19% discount
[3:22] <Keiya> The iPhone is a lot more locked down than even Palm's stuff
[3:22] <Kokopure> Android here we come
[3:22] <TheMilkMan> not too sure how to tell
[3:23] <TheMilkMan> I have a palm pre atm but I'm getting the HTC Evo 4g
[3:23] <TheMilkMan> ftw
[3:23] <gear> i also develop for android as well
[3:23] <vurtual> so
[3:23] <vurtual> something came from UPS
[3:23] <vurtual> It was... a bag
[3:23] <Kokopure> seriously, gear, if you were an app developer I can't believe you'd subject yourself to the App Store's policies.
[3:23] <vurtual> a present!
[3:23] <vurtual> It was... two T-shirts
[3:23] <TheMilkMan> apple=no flash=wtf!?
[3:23] <Kokopure> ^ this.
[3:23] <vurtual> One of them said "FAIL" with a picture of a fallen AT-AT
[3:23] <gear> why not? it makes money
[3:23] <vurtual> the other, "push button, recieve bacon"
[3:23] <vurtual> I am humiliated.
[3:23] * ZaxKellens stabs vurtual.
[3:23] <vurtual> humiliated, and offended.
[3:23] <vurtual> They are no longer in my top five.

[3:24] <gear> plus i can always jailbreak the fucker
[3:24] <vurtual> the iphone also sucks.
[3:24] <Kokopure> gear, you are forgiven in my eyes :3
[3:24] <Kokopure> even I can admit that the iPhone4 is a pretty damn sexy piece of hardware.
[3:24] <Keiya> I don't mind the no flash thing.
[3:24] <gear> lol
[3:24] <Kokopure> it's the "operating system" I have a severe problem with.
[3:24] <Keiya> I prefer javascript + canvas anyway
[3:25] <TheMilkMan> I dont like apple
[3:25] * ZaxKellens eats food.
[3:25] <gear> i agree that we should all be moving torwards html5 and canvas anyway
[3:25] <ZaxKellens> I like apples
[3:25] <vurtual> so, basically
[3:25] <Nyutan> mytouch slide plz. or HTC EVO

[3:29] <ZaxKellens> I'm your friend
[3:29] <TheMilkMan> @Kokopure I dont like apple either way xD

[3:29] <TheMilkMan> Apple is dumb with their restrictions
[3:29] <Kokopure> look, again, it has the potential to be a fairly good device.
[3:29] <Keiya> If nothing else, it drives the Android hardware makers and the software platform to try to stay ahead.
[3:29] <Perry> well hi LuciferZ
[3:29] <vurtual> Go to some hipster shirt irony store
[3:29] <Kokopure> but for a device that they're saying should replace a computer
[3:29] <vurtual> then, go get them some outdated meme shirts.
[3:29] <ZaxKellens> irony store?
[3:30] <vurtual> they will not be your friend anymore.
[3:30] <Kokopure> I want something that acts like a computer.
[3:30] <Kokopure> not a fucking toy.
[3:30] <ZaxKellens> You mean to wear a shirt, but ironically?
[3:30] <gear> the ipad is pretty lame honesly
[3:30] <Kokopure> also it has zero cameras.
[3:30] <gear> i ahve to agree

[3:30] <Kokopure> and the new iPad has two?
[3:30] <TheMilkMan> I saw a bunch of ipads at the airport lol
[3:30] <Kokopure> anyone who buys an iPad before it gets a camera is intentionally shafting themselves.
[3:30] <gear> maybe after a few generations it will be a bit refined
[3:30] <Kokopure> I mean, seriously.
[3:30] <gear> i waited till this iphone to get one

[3:31] <Kokopure> that is
[3:31] <TheMilkMan> http://mimul.com/pebble/default/images/blog/mobile/imat.jpg
[3:31] <Kokopure> they're not mean to create, they're meant to consume.

[3:31] <Keiya> Kokopure: Aye, and not even customizable toys
[3:31] <TheMilkMan> xD
[3:31] <wolf_alex> how?
[3:31] <Kokopure> if you want to make something, you'll be way better off with something else.

[3:41] <Kokopure> ...
[3:41] <Kokopure> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
[3:41] <Kokopure> D:
[3:41] <ZaxKellens> Shadow, he's basically a black hole
[3:42] <Cial> kick ass
[3:42] <Kokopure> my youTube video was rejected
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> And his power can cancel out others I believe
[3:42] <Kokopure> because it's three minutes too long
[3:42] <Kokopure> X___X
[3:42] <Cial> and white beard makes earthquakes
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Wow
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Yep
[3:42] <TheMilkMan> I wish there was a way for cross eye 3d on minecraft....
[3:42] <Kokopure> fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> Kokopure : Split it
[3:42] <ZaxKellens> "void which devours anything, able to pull in (much in the manner of a black hole) and crush his surrounding environment into a pile of rubble"
[3:42] <TrueWolves`> or fastforward it
[3:43] <ZaxKellens> "ability to 'absorb' certain projectiles and then hurl them back at his foes using moves like 'Liberation'. The second, and the most frightening power of the fruit is to nullify other Devil Fruit abilities through physical contact"
[3:43] <Cial> 3D hurts my eyes
[3:43] <ZaxKellens> So basically, he's unstoppable at close range
[3:44] <TheMilkMan> Cross eyed 3d doesnt hurt mine but red and blue does....
[3:44] <vurtual> so left 4 dead 2 was meant ot have more random lines
[3:44] <Cial> and wow luffy will be more than useless against Black beard
[3:44] <vurtual> so far the only line I didn't hear before is one rochelle quotes from zoey

[3:57] <ZaxKellens> Akira?
[3:57] <Keiya> o.O
[3:57] <vurtual> yeah it's a cool concept
[3:57] <vurtual> people try building them
[3:57] <ZaxKellens> You better say yes to that
[3:57] <vurtual> they don't work out that great
[3:57] <TkTech> Yup
[3:57] <Keiya> I would think it'd be, you know, sorta pointless...
[3:57] <ZaxKellens> Ok
[3:57] <vurtual> but on smoother terrain it works.
[3:57] <ZaxKellens> How about Studio Ghibli (Meaning ALL)
[3:57] <Keiya> An automobile would be more versitile and simpler
[3:58] <vurtual> the benefits happen to include stuff like, having stable ground.
[3:58] <TkTech> No clue
[3:58] <vurtual> that won't just fail on you
[3:58] <TkTech> I don't keep track of the studios
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> What do you mean?
[3:58] * malcon21 is now known as malcon2
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> ...
[3:58] <Keiya> A lot of Studio Ghibli's stuff is pretty good/ There's some stuff that's less good, but none of it is bad.
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> *shakes head..*
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> Ok, lemme try to name them all then
[3:58] <TkTech> I'm not a die hard otaku, I just watch anime when I'm out of series
[3:58] <Kokopure> ZaxKellens
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> Yes?
[3:58] <Kokopure> I'm making a video of the trap working >:
[3:58] <Kokopure> |>:|*
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> Sure =O
[3:58] <TkTech> oh
[3:58] <Kokopure> You'll see~
[3:58] <Quatroking> I so diehard otaku
[3:58] <ZaxKellens> We'll see
[3:59] <TkTech> yeah ZaxKellens I have seen most of these
[3:59] <Quatroking> I'm buying a NAS soon because i ran out of disk space
[3:59] <Quatroking> yo
[3:59] <vurtual> if you used otaku in the original japanese sense
[3:59] <Kokopure> god.
[3:59] <Kokopure> this lag is terrible though.
[3:59] <Kokopure> thank god for the update tomorrow.
[3:59] <TkTech> My Neighbour Totoro is the only one I've not seen
[3:59] <vurtual> then technically mr two hundred hours in two weeks could qualify
[3:59] <Kokopure> SEE TOTORO
[3:59] <Quatroking> YOU HAVE NOT SEEN TOTORO
[3:59] <Quatroking> YOU FUCKING WHORE
[3:59] <TkTech> :|
[3:59] <Kokopure> QUICK, SODOMIZE HIM
[3:59] <Quatroking> How could you NOT have seen that one
[3:59] <ZaxKellens> Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea
[3:59] <Quatroking> jesus
[4:00] <Kokopure> Totoro is awesome :x
[4:00] <Quatroking> ghibli ghibli GHIBLIII
[4:00] <Kokopure> Nausicaa is my favorite after Totoro.
[4:00] <Quatroking> totoro is so good I EVEN BOUGHT IT ON DVD
[4:00] <Kokopure> then Castle in the Sky after that.
[4:00] <Quatroking> NON-DUB
[4:00] <vurtual> "I kill you so bad, you get hurt"
[4:00] <Kokopure> I love subs
[4:00] <Kokopure> so
[4:00] <vurtual> becomes "Kill you so bad, and access to harm you."
[4:00] <vurtual> oh arabic, you so silly
[4:00] <TkTech> I _HATE_ dubs
[4:00] <TkTech> I refuse to watch them
[4:00] <ZaxKellens> Grave of the Fireflies, Only Yesterday, Pom Poko, My Neighbors the Yamadas, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, Ocean Waves, Whisper of the Heart, The Cat Returns, Tales from the Earthsea
[4:00] <ZaxKellens> All of those
[4:00] <ZaxKellens> Wait
[4:00] <vurtual> the only thing anyone here has seen is "spirited away"
[4:00] <ZaxKellens> You've never seen Totoro?
[4:01] <vurtual> because it was on cartoon network
[4:01] <TkTech> I've never seen Totoro.
[4:01] <Quatroking> the only dub I accept to watch is Ghost in the Shell SAC because they somehow managed to make the voices identical
[4:01] <ZaxKellens> I've seen all of the first post and some of the 2nd post
[4:01] <vurtual> real men learn the local language of whatever and watch the show/read the thing in its original form
[4:01] <vurtual> no voice changes, no subtitles
[4:01] <TkTech> Ghost in The Shell isn't bad
[4:01] <vurtual> no hired translator(for you rich folk)
[4:01] <ZaxKellens> Sorry, I don't have the time to learn Japanese
[4:01] <TkTech> I loved the movies, liked the series
[4:01] <TkTech> the movies were excellent
[4:02] <TkTech> That one scene with the parade
[4:02] <TkTech> had some of the most amazing detailing I've ever seen
[4:02] <Quatroking> vurtual: "I have My Japanese Learning Program Thing Shit Bitches Fuck This Shit Is Rad (for DS)" on my ds
[4:02] <vurtual> you kids and your foreign cartoons
[4:02] <vurtual> your sentence does not parse
[4:02] <Quatroking> they just pretty much skip romanized japanese so its hard tho
[4:03] <TkTech> Quatroking: got an iPhone?
[4:03] <TkTech> or iTouch?
[4:03] <ZaxKellens> o.o;
[4:03] <vurtual> ...
[4:03] <Quatroking> TkTech, do i look like an apple hippie

[4:04] <Keiya> Oh come on
[4:04] <TkTech> rofl
[4:04] <Cial> hey is Xbox live and microsoft live games on the same live system?
[4:04] <ZaxKellens> Goddammit, where's the new Naruto _-_
[4:04] <Keiya> Cial: Yep
[4:04] <vurtual> I can pay you in woman-love
[4:04] <Keiya> Games for Windows -- Live uses the same account, can crosschat, etc
[4:04] <vurtual> in a "in bed" way
[4:04] <Kodaichi> I've wanted to take Japanese as an extra course in university for the past 2 years, but the seats always fill up before I can register
[4:04] <vurtual> bed
[4:05] <TkTech> Letting console players play with PC players = Horrible idea
[4:05] <vurtual> You're like, 23, ZaxKellens, and watch naruto
[4:05] <vurtual> what.
[4:05] <ZaxKellens> Not watch, read
[4:05] <TkTech> Soccom US Navy Seals should have been a good indicator of that
[4:05] <Timec> omg my driver stopped working with minecraft....(crashed) o.O
[4:05] <Keiya> TkTech: I don't think they do PC-to-console play
[4:05] <Keiya> Just text and voice chat
[4:05] <Cial> ok thanks Keiya
[4:05] <TkTech> Keiya: *whew*
[4:05] <ZaxKellens> It's average so it's ok
[4:05] <TkTech> Soccom was for PC's and the PSP
[4:05] <Keiya> Also it really depends on the game
[4:05] <TkTech> everyone on the PC's would cheat hard
[4:05] <vurtual> Steam: Supports steamworks on PS3, can cross-GAME, is free, cheap deals, and also doesn't suck.
[4:05] <Kodaichi> lol
[4:05] <TkTech> raining rocket launchers and such
[4:05] <ZaxKellens> I don't cheat on multiplayer games
[4:06] <Kodaichi> how do you figure everyone on PC hacks
[4:06] <ZaxKellens> I cheat on oneplayer once I've beaten it

[4:10] <Perry> lolcreepers
[4:10] <Keiya> Also, you will be able to ride next update :J
[4:10] <Quatroking> the fuck is this shit?
[4:10] <Kokopure> creepers will be rideable tomorrow
[4:10] <Kokopure> err
[4:10] <TheMilkMan> Next update is friday?
[4:10] <CyborgDragon> im assuming their was a creeper on the other side
[4:10] <TkTech> Quatroking: no fucking clue
[4:10] <Kokopure> CARTS will
[4:10] <Timec> TkTech: Might be tommorow, infdev update coming (said twitter)
[4:10] <Kokopure> not creepers
[4:10] <TheMilkMan> Creepers will be ridable!? O.o!
[4:10] <TheMilkMan> xD
[4:10] <Perry> When you are all sad because you think creepers are better than you, remember that they're just really messed-up pigs. Right?

[4:10] <CyborgDragon> good thing i had an extra furnace in storage
[4:10] <Keiya> they tend to blow up when you try
[4:10] <CyborgDragon> not tomorrow though keiya
[4:10] <CyborgDragon> he said eventually any entity could ride any other
[4:10] <CyborgDragon> eventually
[4:10] <TheMilkMan> So it's kind of like bull riding?
[4:10] <Quatroking> lmao they want to sell us ads

[4:11] * CyborgDragon is said

[4:11] <TkTech> Quatroking: Fuck em with a spoon
[4:11] <Quatroking> lol no
[4:11] <CyborgDragon> my furnace wall got blown up by a creeper
[4:11] <CyborgDragon> well, one of them did
[4:11] <Quatroking> I'm not rude or anything
[4:11] <Timec> ..
[4:11] <TheMilkMan> Oh, so it'd be kind of like riding in a kamikazi plane?
[4:11] <CyborgDragon> I have a 5x5 wall of furnaces
[4:11] <ZaxKellens> Why?
[4:11] <Kokopure> CyborgDragon, why
[4:11] <Kokopure> :|
[4:11] <Kokopure> they're not any stronger than stone.
[4:11] <TkTech> yes they are O_O
[4:11] <CyborgDragon> because i actually smelted 16 64 stacks of iron at once
[4:11] <TheMilkMan> What else is coming in the next update?
[4:11] <CyborgDragon> and they are koko
[4:11] <CyborgDragon> it's only one wall
[4:11] <Perry> not against creepers
[4:12] <TkTech> yes they are O_O
[4:12] <Perry> ...seriously?
[4:12] <Kokopure> eh...
[4:12] <CyborgDragon> perry they are
[4:12] <TkTech> yes they are O_O
[4:12] <Kokopure> even if they're stronger, they don't look that hawt.
[4:12] <Quatroking> they are literally saying "oh honary administrator"
[4:12] <CyborgDragon> there was a creeper on the other side of my wall
[4:12] <Perry> creepers aren't as effective against furnaces?
[4:12] <CyborgDragon> of furnaces
[4:12] <CyborgDragon> it blew up
[4:12] <TheMilkMan> Do creepers randomly explode or only when I get near them right? So them destroying my tracks at night while I sleep are unlikely?
[4:12] <TkTech> Quatroking: lol....
[4:12] <CyborgDragon> only one furnace was destroyed
[4:12] <Quatroking> like we're in fucking south korea or some bitches country
[4:12] <Kokopure> creepers are super effective against everything.
[4:12] <Perry> O.O
[4:12] <CyborgDragon> koko
[4:12] <Kokopure> even obsidian.
[4:12] <TkTech> TheMilkMan: it won't happen
[4:12] <Kokopure> what
[4:12] <CyborgDragon> only one furnace was destroyed
[4:12] <CyborgDragon> and anyways
[4:12] <Kokopure> it was far away then
[4:12] <Kokopure> :|
[4:12] <TkTech> TheMilkMan: you need to be one block away before they start kabooming
[4:12] <TkTech> or whatever
[4:13] <TheMilkMan> Ah kk
[4:13] <CyborgDragon> my furnace wall was made because i had to smelt 16 stacks of 64 iron at once
[4:13] <TheMilkMan> Thanks TkTech
[4:13] <Perry> "Creeper used terrorism! It's super effective! Stone wall fainted!"
[4:13] <Kokopure> that at least makes sense

[4:15] <Keiya> ... was he still hassling you?
[4:15] <CyborgDragon> what to do now >.<

[4:15] <slowriot> clone is too young to sue anyone
[4:15] <CyborgDragon> or make more hidden chests to store my stuffs in
[4:15] <slowriot> or to even know how to go about it
[4:15] <vurtual> Well I threatened and went through on stabbing him
[4:15] <TrueWolves`> that reminds me!
[4:15] <vurtual> he won't ever mention it

[4:16] <CyborgDragon> it is very useful
[4:16] <TkTech> TheMilkMan: none right now
[4:16] <TkTech> Keiya: Aye
[4:16] <CyborgDragon> when you're deep down far from home
[4:16] <TkTech> Keiya: But he whines loudly
[4:16] <vurtual> but now he has a bunch of stitches not far from his armpit, above his nipple
[4:16] <CyborgDragon> it lets you carry more
[4:16] <TkTech> Keiya: its much faster to startup and more portable as flash anyways
[4:16] <Keiya> all I did was hack it so that it could use any URL instead of specifically Minecraft.

[4:17] <TkTech> A post on the forums made me lol awhile back
[4:17] <TkTech> but the minecraftskins.net forum was deleted :|
[4:17] <Keiya> Heh, that's cool. Only thing it doesn't do is the walk animation
[4:18] <TheMilkMan> Anyways I can't find any iron ever DX so I'm afraid to use any to make any tools cus I know I won't find a decent amount ever again
[4:18] <Keiya> You should have done it in JS and Canvas though! :P
[4:18] <TkTech> pffft :|
[4:18] <TkTech> I wanted portability!
[4:18] <TkTech> Plus, most existing canvas 3D libraries suck my left nut
[4:18] <CyborgDragon> milkman, dig the gravel out of caves
[4:18] <CyborgDragon> i find lots of iron in gravel-filled caves
[4:19] <TheMilkMan> Oh? really?
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> really
[4:19] <Keiya> TkTech: Javascript and Canvas is more portable than Flash.
[4:19] <TheMilkMan> Lol I've always ignored gravel cus it's annoying
[4:19] <TrueWolves`> TkTech, given you run a skin site, perhaps hanging out in #MineCraftSkins may do some good?
[4:19] <TrueWolves`> It's a purely netural room.
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> there's any easy way mine gravel
[4:19] <Keiya> It'll run on anything Flash runs on plus iOS
[4:19] <TrueWolves`> No ties to Clone at all.
[4:19] <TheMilkMan> shovels?
[4:19] <TheMilkMan> xD
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> nope
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> when you break a gravel at the bottom of a column
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> quickly place a torch
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> bam
[4:19] <TkTech> Keiya: its a performance issue
[4:19] <CyborgDragon> any gravel that falls on it is instantly broken
[4:19] * Keiya shrugs
[4:19] <Kokopure> instantly broken?
[4:19] <TkTech> Keiya: Canvas sucks really, really hard if it isn't hardware accelerated
[4:19] <TheMilkMan> That's kind of hard though it falls pretty quick
[4:19] <Kokopure> or stays in place?
[4:20] <CyborgDragon> instantly
[4:20] <CyborgDragon> though if you're too fast
[4:20] <Kokopure> ... you can be too fast?
[4:20] <TkTech> Keiya: and it isn't supported on the most common versions of browsers
[4:20] <CyborgDragon> you'll place it before the gravel above the one you broke turns into an entity
[4:20] <Keiya> You're drawing what, 12 polies?
[4:20] <TheMilkMan> and then what happens?
[4:20] <Keiya> TkTech: All but one browser support it natively in their current version
[4:20] <Kokopure> it probably just stays in midair.

[4:20] <TheMilkMan> Well then I could destory that one and the rest fall?
[4:21] <TkTech> I _WISH_ people updated all the time
[4:21] <TheMilkMan> oh
[4:21] <CyborgDragon> you could, but torches break instantly
[4:21] <Keiya> TkTech: Actually, all but one support it in the common version too
[4:21] <CyborgDragon> so its faster to replace the torch

[4:23] <CyborgDragon> only one difference between lava and water
[4:23] <TheMilkMan> can I make unlimited lava?
[4:23] <quaxar> no
[4:23] <TheMilkMan> Like the water empty water thing?

[4:23] <quaxar> you can trick it to make unlimited lava

[4:23] <Kodaichi> lava in a bucket is crazy dangerous
[4:23] <quaxar> by putting any uh, placable object near a lava block
[4:23] <CyborgDragon> but it doesnt do that with lava
[4:23] <Quatroking> I should dig up my php spam script
[4:23] <CyborgDragon> however
[4:23] <vurtual> left 4 dead 2's best features: adrenaline lets you run through water, hard rain level actually floods the area under your chair when you're in water.
[4:23] <quaxar> and it burns it and becomes source lava
[4:23] <vurtual> result: REALISM
[4:23] <CyborgDragon> if you pour lava on a track
[4:24] <Kodaichi> i think you can even catch on fire if you are too close
[4:24] <TkTech> Keiya: >.<
[4:24] <quaxar> next to a track
[4:24] <CyborgDragon> the track turns into lava springs
[4:24] <Quatroking> send 4000 emails saying "eat a dick" or something
[4:24] <quaxar> not on it
[4:24] <quaxar> so it flows into the track
[4:24] <quaxar> or a sign
[4:24] <quaxar> or a mushroom
[4:24] <quaxar> or a torch on the ground
[4:24] <CyborgDragon> really?
[4:24] <Keiya> TkTech: So set your site to use Chrome Frame
[4:24] <Keiya> Problem solved
[4:24] <CyborgDragon> i didnt know it worked with signs, shrooms, or torches
[4:24] <TheMilkMan> Cool so I can line up some torches and make lava flow on it and I have my own lava moat?
[4:24] <CyborgDragon> doesnt work on ladders probably
[4:24] <TheMilkMan> Does lava destroy dirt/sand?
[4:24] <quaxar> no
[4:24] <TkTech> Keiya: are you offering to re-write it in JS and Canvas?
[4:24] <TheMilkMan> darn so I have to go be a ditch digger :/
[4:25] <TheMilkMan> Hey guys what else will be updated? in the next update?
[4:25] <CyborgDragon> anyone know the space required for a tree to grow?
[4:25] <CyborgDragon> it's 5 high, right
[4:25] <slowriot> 3 squares free on each side

[4:26] <vurtual> so guys
[4:26] <TheMilkMan> so trees wont grow if I put it a ton right next to eachother?
[4:26] <vurtual> you know that one thing, phones can do
[4:26] <vurtual> send multiple texts at once, charging the recepient
[4:26] <vurtual> somebody is a lot, lot poorer now
[4:26] <TheMilkMan> ?
[4:26] <CyborgDragon> lol vurt
[4:26] <CyborgDragon> you cruel, cruel woman
[4:26] <TheMilkMan> vurtual: what you mean?
[4:26] <CyborgDragon> if they pay for text messages
[4:27] <TheMilkMan> Ohhh
[4:27] <TheMilkMan> Wait
[4:27] <TkTech> what
[4:27] <Kodaichi> I'm a bit skeptical
[4:27] <TkTech> vurtual: has titties?
[4:27] <TheMilkMan> I'm pretty sure you aren't charged for recieving only sending.
[4:27] <vurtual> yep, nice big and comfy
[4:27] <LF> On the note of trees
[4:27] <CyborgDragon> milkman
[4:27] <TkTech> I don't mean fat flabs
[4:27] <CyborgDragon> depends on your plan
[4:27] <vurtual> quickly use a trick with phone texting to send thouuuusands of text messages to someone
[4:27] <LF> do they check a 3x3 square around the tree?
[4:27] <TkTech> I mean genuine titties
[4:27] <vurtual> that's a few hundred dollars
[4:27] <LF> or 3 out?
[4:27] <CyborgDragon> my old plan charged for receiving
[4:27] <Perry> I'm so bored
[4:27] <vurtual> female and healthy TkTech
[4:27] <Kodaichi> I found out two people were actually guys that I thought were girls on this channel in the same freaking day
[4:27] <TkTech> and you're in D&D?

[4:27] <TkTech> You actually KNOW what D&D is?
[4:27] <TrueWolves`> !!
[4:27] <TheMilkMan> Oh? that's odd and bad for them to charge for reciving you cant control that....
[4:27] <TrueWolves`> I forgot to rejoin D&D
[4:28] <ZaxKellens> Huh?
[4:28] <ZaxKellens> Rejoin?
[4:28] <ZaxKellens> What do you mean?
[4:28] <TkTech> My stereotypes for females is shattered
[4:28] <vurtual> Yes I know what D&D is, TkTech
[4:28] <TkTech> (Not saying I actually believe you're a female.)
[4:28] <TkTech> It is the internet after all
[4:28] <CyborgDragon> hmm what to do
[4:28] <vurtual> I'm the same person who took all their broken lego structures, and made a massive wargaming thing using D&D 3.5 rules
[4:28] <TrueWolves`> I have the channel in my autojoin in another server which I sometimes use here, but when I leave and use my standard one, I forget to rejoin the channel here.

[4:29] <Koko|YAY> online survival already exists...
[4:29] <Perry> ...lol

[4:30] <vurtual> it's like uncanny valley of yourself
[4:30] <TkTech> Kodaichi: Facebook is the easiest basic check

[4:31] <CyborgDragon> WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM
[4:31] <vurtual> Because partially, I have good understanding of every facet of humanity, and can essentially be anyone, at any time.
[4:31] <PuyoDead> I've already posted pictures, so yea, 'tis old.
[4:31] <vurtual> Including people here.
[4:31] <TkTech> Kodaichi: yay we passed the test!
[4:31] <DrakeHiggins`> look up DrakeHiggins on facebook, I'm like one of only 3 on there.

[4:31] <CyborgDragon> i know >.<
[4:31] <TkTech> See, right there vurtual just admitted he/she/it is either old or a sexually confused male
[4:32] <CyborgDragon> the pigs are just creepy in general
[4:32] <vurtual> I am old, yes.
[4:32] <ZaxKellens> So, how do we know which of these is you TrueWolves?
[4:32] <Kodaichi> it's a shame that you don't get a Turing award for passing the Turing test
[4:32] <CyborgDragon> those eyes..
[4:32] <vurtual> certainly older than most users here.
[4:32] <Perry> Once, I was happily skipping in a field of LSD and I jumped out of my skin when I saw all those pigs appearing in front of me
[4:32] <Perry> -LSD +grass
[4:32] <Perry> still sounds weird

[4:33] <DrakeHiggins`> facebook?
[4:33] <PuyoDead> Mine is easy to find, but I'm pretty sure you have to have an account to even see it.
[4:33] <DrakeHiggins`> the blond haired one
[4:33] <vurtual> you have implanted the concept of a male lesbian into my mind, TkTech
[4:33] <Perry> vurtual: You can't see things clearly on the corners of your field of vision, you barely see any shape, but you see every movement.
[4:33] <ZaxKellens> o.o
[4:33] <vurtual> it scares me :(
[4:34] <ZaxKellens> Moptop?
[4:34] <vurtual> perry, don't tell me what I can and can't see.
[4:34] <DrakeHiggins`> you can post the picture here if you want Zax
[4:34] <Perry> ok ok

[4:34] <ZaxKellens> That one?
[4:34] <vurtual> mansbian?
[4:34] <Perry> I didn't say you weren't seeing it :D
[4:34] <DrakeHiggins`> yes
[4:34] <TkTech> vurtual: when a man thinks he's a girl trapped in a males body and is a "lesbian"
[4:34] <DrakeHiggins`> That is me.
[4:34] <ZaxKellens> Oh yeah, I see Minecraft there
[4:34] <Perry> I also see stuff when I'm not looking
[4:34] <PuyoDead> With minecraft? I should hope so.
[4:34] <Perry> (lul)
[4:34] <vurtual> no as in "I know I am male"
[4:34] <vurtual> but the stereotypical BAD type of lesbian personality

[4:39] <Kokopure> no see
[4:39] <vurtual> PuyoDead, the joke being that they can't breed
[4:39] <vurtual> so yeah
[4:39] <DrakeHiggins`> Humans are so bad at giving birth becuase of are head size and are upright stature.
[4:39] <Kokopure> the gene for homosexuality is genetic.
[4:39] <Kokopure> however
[4:39] <TkTech> Keiya: got lots of sand?
[4:39] <Kodaichi> humans take 18(durr hurr) fucking years to be able to produce children
[4:39] <PuyoDead> Piss poor joke, sure.
[4:39] <Keiya> PuyoDead: Not in its entirety, at least.
[4:39] <Kokopure> the homosexual part just doesn't activate all the time.
[4:39] <TkTech> Kodaichi: 18? lol?
[4:39] <Keiya> Actually, from what I've heard
[4:39] <vurtual> alright campgrounds redux clan arena WOO
[4:39] <Kokopure> heterosexuals can be and often are just carriers.
[4:39] <DrakeHiggins`> ...
[4:39] <DrakeHiggins`> 13*
[4:39] <PuyoDead> 18? That's a bit late.
[4:39] <TkTech> ^-
[4:40] <Kodaichi> according to law. yeah i know
[4:40] <TkTech> There ya go
[4:40] <ZaxKellens> Good
[4:40] <Kodaichi> that was a bit of satire
[4:40] <Keiya> It appears to be that there's genes for 'likes cock' and 'likes pussy' genes
[4:40] <Kokopure> TkTech, what I said?
[4:40] * CyborgDragon is mining
[4:40] <DrakeHiggins`> Humans are mature enough to breed around the age of 13~14
[4:40] <ZaxKellens> It looks like my picture cannot be found by searching for me
[4:40] <Keiya> Which makes their existance FAR more understandable

[4:41] <Keiya> DrakeHiggins`: females really shouldn't until around at least 16 though, it's dangerous to the mother to give birth that young
[4:41] <Kodaichi> humans also have some of the worst adaptability to cold temperatures compared to other animals
[4:41] <DrakeHiggins`> Kokopure, I'm a biologist, I'm looking at it from a purely "Humans as an animal" standpoint.
[4:41] <Keiya> (From what I understand)
[4:41] <TkTech> Kokopure: No....as nature intended us, we reach child bearing age around 13
[4:41] <ZaxKellens> FFFUUUUUUUU
[4:41] <Kokopure> Kodaichi
[4:41] <DrakeHiggins`> your right Keiya
[4:41] <ZaxKellens> Shit
[4:41] <Kodaichi> mammals*
[4:41] <Keiya> Kodaichi: Other than the whole 'we can TAKE your cold adaptation!' thing :P
[4:41] <DrakeHiggins`> Animals only give birth earily when their population is low usualy.
[4:41] <Kokopure> I would think humans have the absolute best adaptation to cold temperatures.
[4:41] <Kokopure> that being, we adapt by wearing other animals.
[4:41] <TkTech> Kokopure: We come from africa, what do you expect, lol
[4:41] <ZaxKellens> After very very very very close searching, I am needing to find and delete some stuff online
[4:41] <DrakeHiggins`> A wolf for instance shouldn't have pups until it is 3 or 4... however they can go as earily as 2, it's not usualy healthy, there is some cases of them being only 1.
[4:42] <Kodaichi> lolol.
[4:42] <Keiya> Kokopure: Yeah, naturally we suck at it but we're capable of working around it :P
[4:42] <Kokopure> that's what it means to be human :D
[4:42] <Keiya> DrakeHiggins`: There's the one 8 year old mother in humans too
[4:42] <Keiya> :P
[4:42] <Kokopure> to suck at everything.
[4:42] <Kodaichi> also
[4:42] <Kokopure> and find workarounds for how much we suck.
[4:42] <DrakeHiggins`> Humans do NOT suck at everything
[4:42] * Lmaoboat (Mibbit@pool-173-79-77-84.washdc.fios.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[4:42] <Kokopure> okay, we're pretty great at walking on two legs.
[4:42] <Kokopure> I'll give us that.
[4:42] <TkTech> Dexterity.
[4:42] <Kodaichi> lots of animals can be comfortable sitting on a hard floor.
[4:42] <Keiya> Kokopure: Actually, we're pretty amazing distance runners and can eat a wider variety of foods than most (not all) animals
[4:42] * TkTech points out he's typing
[4:42] <DrakeHiggins`> We have 5 strong traits: are eyesight is some of the best in the mammial kingdom, a fit human has GREAT endurnace and in the long run can outrun the average fit horse
[4:42] <Kokopure> I suppose that's also true
[4:43] <Perry> Kokopure: We also have thumbs.
[4:43] <Kodaichi> If you've ever been to a school assembly... ffs those floors suck
[4:43] <Keiya> Well, we have the capacity to be. A lot of us are fat bastards :P
[4:43] <Kokopure> ...
[4:43] <DrakeHiggins`> We are very creative and can apply that creativity to thumbs
[4:43] <Kokopure> having thumbs isn't something we're "good at"
[4:43] <TkTech> Keiya++;
[4:43] <vurtual> blue wins the round ;_;
[4:43] <Kokopure> O_o
[4:43] <ZaxKellens> Apparently anyone is easy to find if you look for the right thing
[4:43] * Uniju (Noah@cpe-66-65-233-251.nycap.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[4:43] <DrakeHiggins`> Kokopure, we have great eyesight and great endurance
[4:43] <Perry> I think I'm really good at haviong thumbs okay?
[4:43] <Perry> -o
[4:43] <DrakeHiggins`> and we have great heat tolerance.
[4:43] <Perry> I never lost my thumbs :D
[4:43] <TkTech> ZaxKellens: You lose all privacy the instant you turn on a modem.
[4:43] <Kokopure> because we're nakers...
[4:43] <ZaxKellens> Apparently
[4:43] <TkTech> ZaxKellens: I don't even try
[4:43] <Perry> thus I'm pretty good at having thumbs.
[4:43] <DrakeHiggins`> We are also mostly flea proof having little hair.
[4:43] <TkTech> My nickname is my initials
[4:43] <TkTech> and my email
[4:43] <TkTech> and my facebook
[4:44] <ZaxKellens> I thought I'd kept a few things apart so that I wouldn't be able to be traced, but I have to be careful I guess
[4:44] <DrakeHiggins`> Try to go a whole day with out having thumbs
[4:44] <Perry> But my uncles lost half of his fingers. He is not good at having thumbs.
[4:44] <Perry> *uncle
[4:44] <Keiya> DrakeHiggins`: SOME of us have great eyesight :P
[4:44] <Perry> he's a butcher.
[4:44] * DrakeHiggins` has, it makes picking up stuff and using it a lot harder
[4:44] <Perry> and I feel like I'm talking alone am I not.
[4:44] <DrakeHiggins`> Keiya, if your not fit in the wild, you die
[4:44] <TkTech> Keiya: Its very easy to improve our eyesight :)
[4:44] <Keiya> DrakeHiggins`: Yeah.
[4:44] <DrakeHiggins`> What I'm applying is traits we have as a generaly fit person.
[4:44] <Keiya> Yeah, I know what you mean, thus the :P
[4:45] <TkTech> Just our size is a good advantage
[4:45] <Kodaichi> I wonder if L4D2 is going to let us keep all the mutations
[4:45] <ZaxKellens> TkTech : Do you live/have you lived in Hendersonville, NC?
[4:45] <TkTech> Not many animals will dare to attack humans in groups, let alone a solitary human (although thats a lot more common)
[4:45] <Keiya> Oh, and humans can squeeze through pretty narrow spaces for our size. Not THE narrowist, but pretty narrow
[4:45] <Kodaichi> it would be pretty cool
[4:45] <TkTech> ZaxKellens: Not even the right country
[4:45] <TkTech> Keiya: Cats would win at that for their body size
[4:45] <ZaxKellens> Ok, that's a diff TkTech then
[4:45] <DrakeHiggins`> The reasons we are bad at childbirth is are head size and are unusual body shape.
[4:45] <vurtual> what did I cause!?
[4:46] <ZaxKellens> Oh well
[4:46] <Kodaichi> except, with people scattered across too many modes
[4:46] <ZaxKellens> Feh
[4:46] <ZaxKellens> Oshi
[4:46] <Keiya> Kodaichi: My impression is that once they've all been released, they're going to run them on a loop
[4:46] <Keiya> To give us variety without having too many modes running at once
[4:46] <Kodaichi> yeah

[4:47] <Keiya> What's Madness?
[4:47] <ZaxKellens> Can you see who all likes a certain thing?
[4:47] <ZaxKellens> Like who all likes "This Pickle can get more fans then Nickleback" or sumin?
[4:47] <Kodaichi> I think it's a mode ith no special infected, just massive loads of the commons
[4:47] <TkTech> BUT, to go back on what started this conversation - "gay"ness has been proven to be a genetic mutation. You can't reproduce if you're gay. Solves itself.
[4:47] <LF> Is the space the trees need the blue or the red?

[4:49] <TheMilkMan> Hey guys how do I play survival multiplayer?
[4:49] <ZaxKellens> You don't
[4:49] <TkTech> Keiya: Use cartographer to find veins
[4:50] <TheMilkMan> ZaxKellens: but how do I do it please?
[4:50] <ZaxKellens> No
[4:50] <Dragoon> First, do the konami code on the main website.
[4:50] <TkTech> Keiya: infdev actually has buttloads of diamond
[4:50] <Kodaichi> http://minecast.zuriki.net/ if you want to watch some
[4:50] <ZaxKellens> Don't tell him!
[4:50] <TkTech> Keiya: just hard to find it
[4:50] <TheMilkMan> You mean up up down down left right left right ba start?
[4:50] <Kodaichi> 2 episodes out right now, really funny
[4:50] <Dragoon> Herp
[4:50] * ZaxKellens stabs Kodaichi.
[4:51] <TheMilkMan> Please tell me is there survival multiplayer first of all? I'm really confused
[4:51] <TheMilkMan> what's SMP /
[4:51] <ZaxKellens> Super Mario Porn
[4:51] <Kodaichi> what
[4:51] <TheMilkMan> I lold
[4:51] <Dragoon> SMP is Survival MP
[4:51] <Kokopure> Several Mad Porcupines
[4:51] <Kokopure> new mob
[4:51] <Kodaichi> Zax, I didn't give him the link
[4:51] <Keiya> TheMilkMan: There's not Survival multiplayer, really.
[4:51] <ZaxKellens> Kodaichi : I know
[4:51] <TheMilkMan> But theres sruvival Mp
[4:51] <Dragoon> Yes there is Keiya.
[4:51] <Keiya> There's a hacky way to fake it badly
[4:51] <ZaxKellens> Yep

[4:52] <ZaxKellens> Or I'll kill you all with vuvuzelas
[4:52] <TheMilkMan> So there is no smp without changing shit?
[4:53] <Dragoon> You gotta do the konami code, then right click the indev link, open it in a new tab, then click the big minecraft logo ten times...then you delete and redo your account, and voila! You got into survival mp!
[4:53] <TkTech> DrakeHiggins`: rofl

[4:54] <TheMilkMan> Actually funny thing is to enable developer mode on palm pres you have to search for the konami code
[4:54] <ZaxKellens> Question!
[4:54] <Kodaichi> multidev was a short-lived running joke here on IRC. we all pretended to be playing survival multiplayer testing while chatting on this irc
[4:54] <ZaxKellens> Minecraft podcast : Who are those guys?
[4:55] <Dragoon> Email notch 100 times, spamming "DELETEMYACCOUNT"
[4:55] <DrakeHiggins`> I never took part in multidev
[4:55] <Kodaichi> people got furious
[4:55] <DrakeHiggins`> I found it annoying.
[4:55] <ZaxKellens> ... Nah
[4:55] <ZaxKellens> Not annoying

[5:49] <vurtual> so guys, guess what I found blown out onto my back deck?
[5:49] <Vicrry> some pr0n?
[5:49] <vurtual> no
[5:49] <vurtual> my old water guns!
[5:49] <Vicrry> lol
[5:49] <ZaxKellens> Sweet
[5:50] <ZaxKellens> Fight the storm with water
[5:50] <vurtual> unlike some things, I did have cool water guns
[5:50] <ZaxKellens> Or pee in the water guns and fight with urine
[5:50] <vurtual> Including a really nice, red pistol with lots of capacity
[5:50] <vurtual> a gun my neighbor had, which was known for firing ludicrous amounts of water
[5:50] <ZaxKellens> Goddammit
[5:50] <Omnicide> red rocket
[5:50] <ZaxKellens> No red rocket
[5:50] <vurtual> a gun that uses a(very tiny, but universally-adapted so its okay) backpack tank
[5:50] <vurtual> and then my favorite: A little green one, it has a motor.
[5:51] <vurtual> It's like some kinda tiny water carbine, no pumping, just point and HUGE RANGE
[5:51] <Vicrry> I has the ultimate water gun
[5:51] <vurtual> the tank is of limited size
[5:51] <ZaxKellens> Wtf
[5:51] <vurtual> but I can totally imagine buying one, then making reloadable cells for water
[5:51] <Vicrry> Is called the water hose. Point, aim, then forget that trash and squirt everything :P
[5:51] <ZaxKellens> This makes no sense
[5:51] <ZaxKellens> Why is my food missin...
[5:52] <Vicrry> GIMMEH NOMZ!
[5:52] <Bucashi> rats.
[5:52] <Flamester> You ate it
[5:52] <ZaxKellens> No
[5:52] <Flamester> and dont remember eating it
[5:52] <ZaxKellens> No
[5:52] <vurtual> Vicrry, this has more pressure.
[5:52] <Perry> "'and now, just add water!" Lol.
[5:52] <ZaxKellens> Nnnn
[5:52] <vurtual> I'm bad at counting poptarts
[5:52] <Vicrry> This is what the little water nozzles are for vurtual :P
[5:52] <ZaxKellens> I can't...
[5:53] <vurtual> sometimes I'll eat both, wonder why I don't have any, and realize I ate them all
[5:53] <ZaxKellens> Son, I am dissapoint...
[5:53] <vurtual> other times I'll eat one
[5:53] <vurtual> be okay
[5:53] <vurtual> then realize I have one left! :D
[5:53] <ZaxKellens> Poptarts are yuck
[5:53] <Vicrry> I'm awesome at counting poptarts
[5:53] <ZaxKellens> =O
[5:53] <Vicrry> I cooks some
[5:53] <Omnicide> Odin bids us pace
[5:53] <ZaxKellens> I kid, some poptarts are good
[5:54] <Vicrry> Then there's none. I don't cooks some, then there's none. :P
[5:54] <Omnicide> poptarts own as munchie food
[5:54] <Vicrry> The total of poptarts is always 0 :P
[5:54] <Omnicide> cuz of the lack of effort
[5:54] <ZaxKellens> Bukkit
[5:54] <vurtual> you know, I had this awesome idea
[5:54] <vurtual> you know, mounted machine guns?
[5:54] <vurtual> A nerf motorized machinegun
[5:55] <vurtual> er
[5:55] <vurtual> watergun, not nerf
[5:55] <vurtual> you plug a hose into it
[5:55] <vurtual> pull back a thing to activate it, then it's got two handles and you aim and unleash massive amounts of water.
[5:55] <Vicrry> vurt
[5:55] <Vicrry> It exists
[5:55] <vurtual> http://i.imgur.com/YkE7g.gif
[5:55] <vurtual> then have 2-man teams, one hauling a detached one, and another carrying water tanks for it

[6:47] <LILYO> does anyone actually like smp's texture pack?
[6:47] <LILYO> i dont understand how it's realistic
[6:47] <CyborgDragon> i modified it to my tastes
[6:47] <Askee> I havent seen it
[6:47] <LILYO> the leaves and grass look horrid
[6:48] <Mattress> I played with SMP's to suit my tastes
[6:48] <Draconicus> I think "realistic" reskins are just plain silly in this game.

[6:55] <Crix> is it a lava source thats evaporating?
[6:55] <Dragoon> No, it's encased in glass
[6:55] <vurtual> because you won't love it
[6:55] <Kokopure> Because you touch yourself at night.
[6:55] <CyborgDragon> did you remove the lava source?

[6:58] <Kokopure> Doubt it, Crix
[6:58] <Crix> thanks: Thank you
[6:58] <CyborgDragon> crix, it doesnt
[6:58] <CyborgDragon> it does burn stuff
[6:58] <DimJim> it did in indev, does it not in inf?
[6:58] <CyborgDragon> but it wont start fires
[6:58] <CyborgDragon> except to minecarts
[6:58] <CyborgDragon> roll a minecraft through lava
[6:58] <CyborgDragon> it lights on fire
[6:58] <CyborgDragon> :D
[6:58] <DimJim> too bad the minecart doesn't light things on fire
[6:59] <DimJim> it would be a very impractical but cool way of destroying someone's house
[6:59] <Jat> too bad skeletons get hurt in fire instead of turning into flaming skeletons that shoot flaming arrows
[6:59] <DimJim> light a minecart on fire, run a track through their house, jump in the cart and drive through their house
[6:59] <Jat> or just start a fire on their house
[6:59] <Jat> and then
[6:59] <Jat> run the minecraft

[7:50] <vurtual> YES
[7:50] <vurtual> A RANDOM SMALL RANDOM ATTEMPT DID IT
[7:50] <vurtual> Woooooo
[7:50] <Crix> did what?
[7:51] <vurtual> Dreadnaught trash cleanup
[7:51] <Crix> wat gaem?
[7:51] <vurtual> Super Mario Galaxy
[7:51] <vurtual> Two more stars left man
[7:51] <Crix> never played it :(
[7:51] <Pikablu> god i hated the trash minigame
[7:51] <vurtual> Dreadnaught purple coins...
[7:51] <vurtual> and then LUIGI'S PURPLE COINS
[7:51] <CyborgDragon> hey guys: my cave complex with lots of tracks, check it out: http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?z3jymndqmzo
[7:51] <vurtual> I read some techniques, Pikablu
[7:51] <CyborgDragon> also
[7:51] <vurtual> then I just lit all the bombs at once
[7:51] <vurtual> threw them in place
[7:51] <CyborgDragon> tell me when you find the secret chests
[7:51] <vurtual> and won with barely any time left
[7:52] <vurtual> secret chests what oh
[7:52] <Pikablu> throw bombs diagonally first and then worry about the ones to your side
[7:52] <Pikablu> that's what i did
[7:52] <Heinoji> Could someone tell me how to quickly get underway with indev?
[7:52] <Crix> dont
[7:52] <Crix> play infdev
[7:52] <Heinoji> inf*dev
[7:52] <GvJordan> hm
[7:52] <Crix> ah
[7:52] <Crix> start with trees
[7:52] <CyborgDragon> and uh, dont do something stupid like overwriting your world1 with, back yours up first
[7:52] <Crix> get about 10 logs
[7:52] <CyborgDragon> with mine*
[7:52] <Crix> make a crafting table, and a wooden pick
[7:52] <GvJordan> My problem with infdev, is that sometimes the java process doesnt' close? or a second one is spawned. bleh
[7:52] <Pikablu> brb
[7:53] <GvJordan> 1fps unless i kill both java processes
[7:53] <CyborgDragon> i should probably just captured video of it
[7:53] <Crix> find some stone, and mine 32 stone with it
[7:53] <CyborgDragon> i hate that too, gv
[7:53] <Crix> then make some stone tools
[7:53] <Crix> proceed to find a cave, and get some coal for torches
[7:53] <Crix> after you do that.. you're pretty much golden
[7:53] <Crix> do whatever you want
[7:53] <Crix> most important thing is to always have logs, and always have torches
[7:53] <Heinoji> What about the mobs
[7:53] <CyborgDragon> be like me
[7:54] <CyborgDragon> and be a cave hermit
[7:54] <Crix> oh, well if you're not on peaceful, then craft a stone sword (easy to do during the first day)
[7:54] <Crix> and be careful!
[7:54] <CyborgDragon> i dont like peaceful, but to each his own
[7:54] <Crix> At night I suggest building a small 4x4 house (4x4x2 space inside)
[7:54] <Flamester> and you shouldnt be on peacefull
[7:54] <Crix> and then make a mining shaft at night
[7:54] <CyborgDragon> flamester, to each his own
[7:54] <Flamester> takes all the fun out of it
[7:54] <Crix> keep the shaft well lit
[7:54] <GvJordan> http://www.livestream.com/gvjordan
[7:54] <CyborgDragon> dont flame peaceful players
[7:54] <Crix> flamester: Wrong
[7:54] <Crix> I have more fun with it on peaceful
[7:55] <Crix> right now, playing off peaceful is just ANNOYING
[7:55] <Crix> there's not enough mobs to do anything
[7:55] <Crix> just to bug you
[7:55] <CyborgDragon> i have more fun on normal in my caves
[7:55] <Crix> its like 1 mob a night, sometimes...
[7:55] <Crix> now I like it when there's like 50 per night
[7:55] <CyborgDragon> the occasional spider in my caves is fun to fight
[7:55] <CyborgDragon> and knock into lava
[7:55] <Crix> i'd rather play on peaceful or hard
[7:55] <Crix> ><
[7:55] <Crix> if i want mobs, i want MOBS

[7:57] <CyborgDragon> anyone downloaded my world to play it?
[7:57] <Crix> "wat!?"
[7:57] <Liam> I just replaced the "SizeOnDisk" value in the hex editor with "FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00"
[7:57] <Liam> xD
[7:57] <CyborgDragon> crix the size is actually stored in a variable

[7:57] <Crix> i'm just saying
[7:57] <Liam> :3
[7:57] <Crix> if that was the actual size
[7:57] <CyborgDragon> it just adds to it
[7:57] <Crix> i no :)
[7:57] <CyborgDragon> anyways
[7:57] <Liam> the number is... negative
[7:57] <Liam> lol
[7:57] <CyborgDragon> no one?
[7:57] <CyborgDragon> D:
[7:58] <Crix> tired of gravel/sand in my way... thank notchgod that shovels are easy to make out of iron cuz its only 1 iron per
[7:59] <CyborgDragon> crix....
[7:59] <CyborgDragon> screw shovels
[7:59] <CyborgDragon> they're a waste of mats ever since i found that awesome glitch
[7:59] <Crix> shovels rock!
[7:59] <Crix> oh

[8:00] <Thistledown> shovel*
[8:00] <vurtual> noo
[8:00] <vurtual> I had them all ;_;
[8:00] <vurtual> I had all the coins
[8:00] <Crix> but it lasts twice as long thistle
[8:00] <vurtual> almost all of them
[8:00] <vurtual> almost finished the level, and I died
[8:00] <vurtual> this is cruel. I'm crying right now.
[8:00] <Thistledown> So? Make two shovels. :D
[8:00] <CyborgDragon> but crix
[8:00] <vurtual> I'm %bcrying
[8:00] <CyborgDragon> iron is more valuable
[8:00] <Crix> and i mean, one iron shovel can last a LONG time underground, cuz i dont have to use them often
[8:00] <Crix> they look kewler
[8:00] <CyborgDragon> did anyone download my world to explore it?

[8:02] <vurtual> but worse
[8:02] <CyborgDragon> who downloaded?
[8:02] <vurtual> because you can completely fail, but be allowed ot keep going, losing

[8:07] <TrueWolves`> Crix, if I'm ever in the same multiplayer server as you, I can help ya build an iron tower.
[8:07] <Zaneo> heh part of my map still has the old generator that was generous with iron
[8:07] <CyborgDragon> it still is
[8:08] <Zaneo> not really
[8:08] <CyborgDragon> most of my iron is near gravel
[8:08] <Crix> zaneo, i have a game where i got literally about 150 BLOCKS of iron, in 2 nights...
[8:08] <CyborgDragon> i have gotten over 700 blocks of iron
[8:08] <Zaneo> it likes to clump it in 3's or 4's
[8:08] <Crix> truewolves: Thank you :)
[8:08] <Crix> and cyrborg, its really not
[8:08] <Crix> it used to be in the 20's, 30's sometimes 40's...
[8:08] <CyborgDragon> i know what it used to be
[8:08] <Crix> now it's 2-6 per lump
[8:08] <CyborgDragon> it's just more scattered now
[8:08] <Crix> and less dense
[8:08] <CyborgDragon> but its the same amount generally
[8:08] <Crix> if you look at cartograph slices
[8:08] <Crix> no its really not
[8:08] <Crix> there's actually less of it ><
[8:09] <Heinoji> Do I hide in my cabin at night or should I be mining?
[8:09] * CyborgDragon compares a pre-update map and a new map
[8:09] <CyborgDragon> odd...they be the same amount approximately

[8:18] <Crix> you can SEE the line
[8:18] <Crix> from the wednesday generator to the thursday one
[8:18] <Crix> there is MUCH less ores
[8:18] <Crix> just in general
[8:18] <Askee> :(
[8:18] <Crix> because the more black there is, the less ore there is
[8:19] <Crix> the old one was like, supersaturated, the new one is like, puny ores
[8:19] <Crix> And green is iron
[8:19] <Crix> as you can see, there's much less of it

[8:20] <Crix> green is iron

[8:20] <Crix> yeah lol
[8:21] <Crix> but its LESS common
[8:21] <Crix> in the newer gen
[8:21] <vurtual> so maybe coal shouldn't exist like this
[8:21] <vurtual> maybe random bits of flammable coal standins

[8:23] <Crix> maybe just problems with the fill command

[8:23] <Crix> in any case
[8:23] <vurtual> so that we have to make massive, unsafe mines
[8:23] <Crix> theres WAAAY less green
[8:23] <CyborgDragon> then what is black on the transparent ore maps?
[8:23] <TheMilkMan> Hey guys will lava break torches? like if I put a lava above a torch will the torch break?
[8:23] <CyborgDragon> oh thats it
[8:23] <Crix> cyborg, i filled in the black
[8:23] <CyborgDragon> crix
[8:23] <Crix> to make it easier to see
[8:23] <CyborgDragon> its black is coal, red is iron, green is gold
[8:23] <Crix> no its not
[8:23] <CyborgDragon> yes it is

[8:24] <Crix> http://img18.imageshack.us/f/map4ore.jpg/
[8:24] <Crix> gold wouldn't be anything other than gold...
[8:24] <Crix> because there's blue for diamond
[8:24] <Crix> so green has to be iron, red has to be coal
[8:24] <CyborgDragon> SIGH
[8:24] <CyborgDragon> i said the correct colors
[8:24] <CyborgDragon> i even looked in the damn thread
[8:24] <CyborgDragon> green is gold
[8:24] <Crix> Well is it for cartograph 3.1?
[8:24] <Crix> cuz thats what i used
[8:24] <CyborgDragon> the yellow/gold color is when green and red are on top of each other

[8:55] <Crix> in fact...
[8:55] <Crix> can't remember last time it did
[8:55] <Dude> and loading times
[8:56] <Dude> because it's gotta load java everytime
[8:56] <Dude> and the infdev applet

[8:57] <Keiya_> It's /trivial/ to mine in real life
[8:57] <Shadowfox> Yea the first time I played this I knew I was going to buy it
[8:57] <Shadowfox> I just love exploration in games like morrowind and oblivion, and this has unlimited potential for making creative worlds and exploring them
[8:58] <cynicalAlchemist> Is it me or that Iron became the new diamond and diamond got even more rare?
[8:58] <Crix> I've played this 13 dollar game more than I've played a LOT of my games I've payed full (50 or 60) for...
[8:58] <Shadowfox> yeah haha
[8:58] <Crix> cynicalalchemist, we went over this earlier, EVERYTHING got more rare :(
[8:58] <Crix> I has a picture to show joo

[8:59] <Crix> thursday
[8:59] <Crix> no, caves had superdense stuff for wednesday
[8:59] <Shadowfox> So how do I get a workbench
[8:59] <Crix> then thursday when he added gravel/dirt in caves, densities shot way down
[9:00] <Crix> shadowfox, check crafting page, its a 2x2 block of wood (in your inventory)
[9:00] <Keiya_> Oooh....
[9:00] <Crix> and logs =/= planks
[9:00] <Keiya_> I don't like the way he did gravel and dirt in caves
[9:00] <Crix> same
[9:00] <Keiya_> It should sometimes be found on the bottom, a layer or two thick, yes
[9:00] <Crix> I want a different kind of ROCK
[9:00] <Crix> not dirt/gravel
[9:00] <Keiya_> but not walls and shit
[9:00] <Keiya_> Crix, is what I suggested okay?
[9:00] <TheMilkMan> Can torches not be placed on glass?
[9:00] <Crix> yea
[9:01] <Crix> i'd rather have more types of rocks tho
[9:01] <Shadowfox> I'm reading the page but I don't have anything in my inventory
[9:01] <Crix> that would all give cobblestone
[9:01] <Crix> shadowfox, you gotta chop some trees with ur fists
[9:01] <Crix> :D
[9:01] <Shadowfox> lol alright
[9:01] <Crix> you can get anything with your hands, but tools just make it faster
[9:01] <TheMilkMan> go punch some trees down lols
[9:01] <TheMilkMan> No I'm pretty sure mining ores with your hands takes forever and you get nothing?
[9:01] <Crix> namely: stones take infinity-1 time with your fists
[9:01] <IceFlinger> actually
[9:01] <Crix> and yeah, stones you wont even get the loots without a pickaxe
[9:02] <IceFlinger> breaking stone with hands
[9:02] <IceFlinger> you get nothing
[9:02] <Crix> but everything else is ok with fists ><
[9:02] <TheMilkMan> That's what she said?
[9:02] <TrueWolves|x-x> Crix, you don't get any ore with fists
[9:02] <Crix> yes yes we know
[9:02] <Crix> i mis-spoke
[9:02] <IceFlinger> I don't think you should get anything without tools
[9:02] <Crix> lol
[9:02] <TheMilkMan> Guys can torche not go on glass?
[9:02] <Shadowfox> Alright so now I have a bunch of wood
[9:02] <Crix> torche: The porche ON FIRE
[9:02] <IceFlinger> And you should start with a wooden axe or somehting
[9:02] <Flamester> it cant
[9:02] <Flamester> glass is slick or something
[9:02] <TheMilkMan> Aw man
[9:03] <Crix> shadowfox: So yeah, put the logs in ur inventory by themselves, and make planks
[9:03] <Flamester> not even ladders stick to glass
[9:03] <TheMilkMan> How do I make a lighthouse with glass tehN?
[9:03] <Crix> then use planks to make a crafting table, etc. etc.

[9:08] <Crix> it just came to me, and i wus like, HAY, funny joek!
[9:08] <Keiya_> Hmm... I wonder if the reason density decreased is because for underground features, it determines there will be one, then decides what it is?
[9:08] <Crix> keiya_ Its because multiplayer is on the way
[9:08] <Flamester> Creepers
[9:08] <Flamester> gonna

[9:22] <CyborgDragon> it takes two minutes to break with a diamond pick
[9:22] <Keiya_> (I can't seem to break through it /at all/ without diamond. I thought grief potential was why you can break through rock (sssllloooowwwwllllyyy) without a pick?)
[9:22] <CyborgDragon> and gives you one measly cobblestone
[9:22] <Crix> WHO TOLD ME IT WAS UP/LEFT
[9:22] <Crix> I shall slay thee!

[9:24] <CyborgDragon> what are you going by?

[9:24] <Crix> but i'm 99% sure
[9:24] <CyborgDragon> up/right is north
[9:24] <Crix> 1 sec, lemme check again
[9:24] <Crix> i mean in the visualizer
[9:24] <Crix> the one notch has
[9:25] <CyborgDragon> yeah i know
[9:25] <CyborgDragon> in notch's vis
[9:25] <CyborgDragon> up/right is north
[9:25] <vurtual> waiting for alyx still
[9:25] <Crix> nope
[9:25] <Flamester> does it matter what north is?
[9:25] <CyborgDragon> it is crix
[9:25] <Flamester> we dont have a compass yet
[9:25] <CyborgDragon> crix it's like this
[9:25] <CyborgDragon> notch's visualizer=the map
[9:25] <CyborgDragon> it's an isometric map
[9:25] <CyborgDragon> so up/right is north
[9:25] <Crix> i understand isometric
[9:25] <Crix> but its not ANGLED that way
[9:25] <Mattress> North is 90 degrees right of where the sun goes down

[9:27] <Crix> stick with the way it is
[9:27] <CyborgDragon> they said that because of the way the sun is rotated
[9:27] <Crix> clouds ALWAYS go north, stuff sets in the west
[9:27] <Crix> exactly
[9:27] <Mosslander> I just noticed that lava doesn't set wood on fire.
[9:27] <CyborgDragon> but whatever notch shows as north in the visualizer/map
[9:27] <CyborgDragon> is north
[9:27] <CyborgDragon> so quit whining

[9:27] <Crix> i see no reason why thats true cyborg...

[9:28] <Crix> the sun sets in the west more than a visualizer has north being up/right
[9:28] <Crix> :D
[9:28] <Shadowfox> How do I build a furnace?
[9:28] <Crix> maybe he just wanted it to have that angle for a certain reason

[9:31] <CyborgDragon> and geometric north
[9:31] <Flamester> heh
[9:31] <Crix> i was still in the "sun sets west clouds go north" like everyone else in the minecraft world
[9:31] <Flamester> what shape is the world
[9:31] <Shadowfox> Man this game is about 1000x better now that I know about all this CRAFTING stuff lol
[9:31] <Flamester> somone answer that
[9:31] <Dude> flat
[9:31] <Crix> I'm not saying you're WRONG, I just dont like it that way and most people dont think that way
[9:31] <Pikablu> nope the sun sets in the north
[9:31] <CyborgDragon> which would be 90 degrees to the left of geometric east, which is defined as where the sun rises

[9:39] <Gunmage> Ha, it is 257
[9:39] <Dude> so why is water and lava still broken and terrible
[9:39] <Zaikantos> its 257
[9:39] <raquzzic> Is the forums down or s it just me?
[9:39] <Zaikantos> Raq its just u
[9:39] <CyborgDragon> dude how is it still broken?
[9:39] <Gunmage> Link me to forums please
[9:40] <Dude> it doesn't flow horizontally is a good reason
[9:40] <raquzzic> so it isnt just me?
[9:40] <Dude> another good reason is two buckets of water is all i need to flood anything
[9:40] <Gunmage> No, it is just you
[9:40] <Shadowfox> Crix: when I break gravel how come it doesn't give me any bricks
[9:40] <Dude> and by flood i mean "completely flood"
[9:40] <CyborgDragon> well dude
[9:40] <CyborgDragon> it's not realistic water
[9:41] <Dude> holy shit really?????
[9:41] <CyborgDragon> notch didnt want realistic water due to griefing
[9:41] <Gunmage> Realistic water?
[9:41] <Dude> so that's why i can flood everything with two buckets of water
[9:41] <Gunmage> Having water multiply like a blob was realistic to you?
[9:41] <CyborgDragon> yeah it is
[9:41] <Zaikantos> Anyway, time to dig a 13x13x6 room out. See ya soon
[9:41] <CyborgDragon> no it wasnt gunmage
[9:41] <keiya__> gig14-0-0.rlghnca-rtr1.nc.rr.com is as far as my packets can get... grah
[9:41] <keiya__> Right state, at least >_>
[9:41] <GM> Everything can be used for Griefing in the even of a Multiplayer Infdev
[9:41] <Dude> now to find notch on minecraft and flood anything he makes
[9:41] <raquzzic> 6 more days until ban over...
[9:41] <Gunmage> Well
[9:41] <Shadowfox> Gunmage: if it comes from the sea than it would be "unlimited"
[9:41] <CyborgDragon> dude, we know
[9:41] <Gunmage> Its infdev
[9:42] <GM> Yeah
[9:42] <CyborgDragon> it was a futile attempt to stop griefing
[9:42] <Gunmage> You buy the game to play infdev
[9:42] <CyborgDragon> he'll probably make real water eventually
[9:42] <Gunmage> I doubt there will be a lot of greifing
[9:42] <CyborgDragon> and make infinite sources act like springs
[9:42] <GM> I doubt there would not be
[9:42] <Gunmage> What
[9:42] <Pikablu> so many god damn hitlers
[9:42] <GM> Obsidian box around the spawn point type stuff
[9:42] <Gunmage> I know there will be some greifing

[9:43] <Shadowfox> Crix: you there man?
[9:43] <Dude> those are amazing shadows
[9:43] <GM> Given that it's Minecraft with an RPG element, I can only imagine there would be tons more ways to Grief
[9:43] <Gunmage> There could be more ways
[9:43] <Gunmage> But less people will

[9:47] <vurtual> how to make non-PVP areas: Have really good guards
[9:47] <Gunmage> Well perhaps
[9:47] <Shadowfox> CyborgDragon but to make a pickaxe I need a furnace
[9:47] <Dude> can they get hurt by the environment
[9:47] <TrueWolves|x-x> Notch already said that he's making PvP a setting, with the defualt on.
[9:47] <Dude> then it's worthless
[9:47] <Gunmage> Player Versus Player
[9:47] <CyborgDragon> no you dont shadow
[9:47] <Gunmage> That is enviroment technically
[9:47] <CyborgDragon> you need a cworkbench

[9:47] <CyborgDragon> and also shadow
[9:47] <Gunmage> But you could just dig your way out >_>
[9:47] <GM> I don't
[9:47] <vurtual> so you need to go into her cave and use your wood picakxe
[9:48] <CyborgDragon> you cant make a pickaxe with solid stone
[9:48] <CyborgDragon> you can only make tools with cobblestone
[9:48] <Dude> if they're quick enough they can seal you in before you react
[9:48] <Shadowfox> I see
[9:48] <Dude> or if you just wandered into the right trap
[9:48] <Gunmage> Gawd I get your point
[9:48] <Pikablu> so dude how about that hot new idea everyones buzzing about these days which is castle's secret slide
[9:48] <vurtual> duel of the fates is playing and I just went through the finish of the Entanglement chapter, but

[9:49] <Pikablu> how about crouching

[9:49] <Gunmage> lol
[9:50] <Dude> if you make it so crawling can't use anything then it's pointless
[9:50] <Dude> if you make it so crawling can use anything then it looks really dumb
[9:50] <Gunmage> err
[9:50] <vurtual> if you're rolling fast, you can jump really high if you jump into someone, and it hurts them
[9:50] <vurtual> and you fly back a bit
[9:50] <Gunmage> You could just make it so your flat on the ground
[9:50] <Gunmage> Knees bent, arms bent
[9:50] <vurtual> then if you're ever in the air, you can instantly flip out your whole body
[9:50] <Gunmage> Army crawl.

[10:39] <Factory> yes they do
[10:39] <Factory> ...
[10:39] <Dude> and they don't work underground
[10:39] <Factory> do you abide?
[10:39] * TrueWolves|x-x is now known as TW|Napping
[10:40] <Dude> nope
[10:40] <Dude> the only reason to craft a sundial in minecraft would be the same reason as paintings
[10:40] <Dude> "aesthetics"
[10:41] <vede> I like the quotes around "aesthetics"
[10:41] <vede> Like aeshetics in Minecraft don't actually exist.
[10:41] <Pikablu> ...dumb
[10:41] * DmpDk (dmpdk@0x573a66bf.ronnqu1.dynamic.dsl.tele.dk) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[10:41] <vede> Also, I think sundials that work underground would totally fit Minecraft's theme.
[10:41] <Dude> yeah that's pretty much my response
[10:41] <Dude> how the fuck would that make sense
[10:41] <Dude> unless they were like
[10:41] <Dude> magic
[10:42] <vede> Dude, who cares if it makes sense?
[10:42] <vede> Really, I'm not trying to be scientifically accurate.
[10:42] <Dude> the creepers do
[10:42] <Factory> look...
[10:42] <Dude> doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that sundials don't work in the dark
[10:42] <vede> Underground sundials would fit pretty well with the rest of Minecraft.
[10:42] <vede> Dude, *NO SHIT*
[10:42] <Dude> yeah
[10:42] <Dude> minecraft manguys aren't scientists
[10:43] <Factory> if you made a entite above ground,that you could link to a portable one
[10:43] <Dude> but they're not idiots
[10:43] <Mattress> I'm going to make a lava sundial
[10:43] <Pikablu> i like how you put asterisks around NO SHIT
[10:43] <CyborgDragon> flamester, still having fun on my world?
[10:43] <Pikablu> like you're taking a shit or something
[10:43] <Dude> oh you!
[10:43] <Factory> *NO!, SHIT!!!*
[10:43] <Flamester> haha
[10:43] <Pikablu> tasty tasty shit
[10:44] <Flamester> I tricked a creeper down a hole to the udnerworld
[10:44] <Flamester> now
[10:44] <Flamester> im going to flood the underworld
[10:44] <Factory> asshole
[10:44] <Askee> lol
[10:44] <vede> Dude, apparently you still haven't figured this out, but the idea here is not to be scientifically accurate. Even if an underground sundial doesn't make sense in real life, it can still make sense in Minecraft world, because Minecraft is a very silly game.
[10:44] <DimJim> anyone here afraid of the dark
[10:44] <vede> And underground sundials are very silly.
[10:44] <Factory> creepers have souls too
[10:44] <Dude> no they're not
[10:44] <Factory> dude
[10:44] <Dude> they're "fuck how does that work man"
[10:44] <Mattress> Creepers don't have feelings. They're made of rubber
[10:44] <Dude> you know
[10:44] <Factory> lava in a bucket in a black guys pocket is silly
[10:44] <Dude> like the water and lava
[10:45] <Mattress> Lava bucket with no handle
[10:45] <Shadowfox> okay then go play a different game
[10:45] <Pikablu> sundials working underground is as fuck as that damn current that is leading to nowhere which is also keeping me from running from a skeleton
[10:45] <vede> Dude, it works the same way sunlight can only be perpendicular to the ground.
[10:45] <Factory> "the lonliest man in this infinite world...MINECRAFT"
[10:45] <Dude> that's just notch's lazy lighting code
[10:45] <vede> If you want to try to make sense, then sundials would *never* be viable in Minecraft because it would always seem like it's noon.
[10:45] <vede> Or night.
[10:45] * Pikablu was kicked from #minecraft by TW|Napping
[10:46] <DimJim> what

[10:46] <Pikablu> ...i'm trolling by complaining about a current
[10:46] <Factory> ???
[10:46] <vede> Dude, there's a difference between laziness and style choices.
[10:46] <TW|Napping> I think I missed
[10:46] <Factory> what the hell tw?
[10:46] <TW|Napping> Sorry Pika

[10:46] <Dude> what
[10:46] <Flamester> apperantly
[10:46] * TW|Napping is tired >.-

[10:48] <Dude> but that would require magic!
[10:48] <Factory> go now, download robot science's albums off their site for free, and listen to them while playing minecraft. so awesome, so NSYNC
[10:48] <CyborgDragon> ffffffff----
[10:48] <CyborgDragon> i just realized something
[10:48] <CyborgDragon> breaking a double stair block
[10:48] <vede> Dude, we already have magic.
[10:48] <CyborgDragon> only gives you one stair back >.<
[10:48] <Dude> where
[10:49] <Factory> lol
[10:49] <Dude> unless it's crafting
[10:49] <Flamester> haha
[10:49] <Factory> cyborg
[10:49] <Askee> wow
[10:49] <Flamester> i doged 3 skeletons worth of arrows
[10:49] <vede> There's the fact that the Minecraft dude can carry around enough stone to make small objects stick to has back. *From gravity*
[10:49] <Factory> seriously
[10:49] <Askee> I just found 43 coal in one area
[10:49] <vede> *his back
[10:49] <Factory> go try what i said
[10:50] <Flamester> I died from trying to dig up the arrows fromt he sand
[10:50] <Factory> if it isnt pure bliss, ill construct you a tower to the clouds of obsidian
[10:50] <Dude> ...so the game having an inventory system is magic?
[10:50] <vede> Four-ish chests of full of stone in Minecraft would produce enough gravitational pull that small bugs would struggle to escape it.
[10:50] <TW|Napping> X3
[10:50] <vede> Does that make sense?
[10:50] * TW|Napping sets mode +v vede
[10:50] <Pikablu> yes

[10:50] <Dude> gonna pull a cyborgdragon here
[10:50] <Keiya> YAY!
[10:50] <Dude> "lol alien world"
[10:50] <CyborgDragon> What?

[10:51] <CyborgDragon> you said my name
[10:51] <vede> Okay, then in this alien world, sundials work underground.
[10:51] <Factory> what does "voices" do?
[10:51] <vede> Welcome to this world. It's called "fiction"
[10:51] <vede> Anything goes.
[10:51] <Dude> oh boy!
[10:51] <Dude> where's my guns
[10:51] <Pikablu> light works differently because it's on a different planet
[10:51] <Dude> and steampunk and modern weapons and laser cannons
[10:51] <vede> Pikablu, it has three suns! Two of which are in the ground!
[10:52] <Pikablu> WHAT
[10:52] <Pikablu> MY FEET THEY BURN
[10:52] <Factory> tatooine..
[10:52] <vede> That's how underground sundials work.
[10:52] <Pikablu> but
[10:52] <Pikablu> ow my feet
[10:52] <Dude> oh wait
[10:52] <Dude> underground sundials can't work
[10:52] <Dude> because you need torches to grow trees/crops
[10:52] <Pikablu> wait a minute
[10:52] <DimJim> why are you talking about UNDERGROUND SUNDIALS anyway
[10:53] <vede> Dude, another thing that makes no sense in Minecraft is the fact that you can grow trees and crops underground with torches. In just a couple days.
[10:53] <vede> (You just reminded me.)
[10:53] <Dude> how
[10:53] <Pikablu> if a sundial on the surface wouldn't work because it always looks like it's noon then why would an underground sundial work
[10:53] <vede> Skeletons walk around and shoot arrows out of nowhere.
[10:53] <Dude> how is that different from growing indoor plants in real life?
[10:53] <DimJim> i propose a large clock system powered by a zombie turning a wheel
[10:53] <DimJim> dude: i doubt there's much nutrition underground!
[10:54] <Flamester> Vede
[10:54] <Flamester> Question
[10:54] <Pikablu> hey
[10:54] <Pikablu> coal is tasty
[10:54] <Dude> you can move dirt so
[10:54] <Flamester> if i dig up dirt from the groond and move it to the top of my tower
[10:54] <drupe> Plants need sunlight, Dude.
[10:54] <vede> You can punch through a cubic meter of wood with your bare hands in a matter of seconds.
[10:54] <drupe> House plants too.
[10:54] <Flamester> why can I still grow wheat on it?
[10:55] <Pikablu> and being able to break things justifies there being no sunlight underground for a sundial to work on
[10:55] <DimJim> vede: the minecraft man is a miracle
[10:55] <Shrub> hai guys
[10:55] <DimJim> let's just say
[10:55] <DimJim> miracles
[10:55] <Dude> yeah
[10:55] <Dude> sunlight
[10:55] <DimJim> that's how an underground sundial works
[10:55] <Furyhunter> <vede> You can punch through a cubic meter of wood with your bare hands in a matter of seconds.
[10:55] <Dude> or regular light
[10:55] <Furyhunter> only because it's practically impossible to get started otherwise
[10:55] <Factory> anyone playing minecraft atm?
[10:55] <Pikablu> it's an angel parented to the sun rotating around my sundial
[10:55] <Pikablu> i hate angels

[11:03] <TW|Napping> I'm personaly against gold as coinage.
[11:03] <Shrub> I mean you can just trade something else
[11:03] <Shrub> I think Gold should jsut be used for magic
[11:04] <Flamester_> Cigarweed
[11:04] <Shrub> or Electrical conductors :S
[11:04] <Flamester_> needs to be in
[11:04] <Shrub> or to make logic blocks!
[11:04] <TW|Napping> Notch said wood, diamonds, and gold (maybe in that order) would be used for magic.
[11:04] <TW|Napping> IF he added magic
[11:04] <Shrub> Logic blocks would be good for Gold
[11:04] <TW|Napping> Indeed.

[12:38] <CyborgDragon> factory, food for the hunge, dunk your head in water for the sleep deprivation
[12:38] <CyborgDragon> hunger*
[12:38] <Quatroking> do add diabetes
[12:38] <Flot> You know, I'm starting to reflect on this boat idea: you'd be able to make huge floating ships, tiny rafts, maybe even floating houses, although I'm sure there would have to be a limit somewhere...
[12:38] <Sparky20> today's update?
[12:39] <Quatroking> Sparky20, real men stalk Notch 24/7 using Twitter
[12:39] <CyborgDragon> twitter+blog, quatro
[12:39] <Quatroking> 10 hours ago: xnotch: Phew, entity saving works now. I still need to tweak it a bit, though. Infdev update tomorrow!
[12:39] <Flot> Say now. Would calculating the physics of an item that is 20X20 in size take more processing power than calculating the physics of an item that is 2X2 in size?
[12:39] <Sparky20> rss feeds.

[12:41] <Flot> But that'd involve digging to the bottom of the world most likely.
[12:41] <Flot> A lot of people would rather not.
[12:41] <CyborgDragon> and also, the minerals, so many people seem to be having trouble finding minerals
[12:41] <Factory> yeah, but coal is abundant
[12:41] <Flot> It's all luck Cyborg, I've found plenty of everything.
[12:41] <CyborgDragon> i've found more iron than coal
[12:41] <CyborgDragon> over 1000 iron now
[12:41] <CyborgDragon> most of it made into tracks
[12:41] <CyborgDragon> xD
[12:41] <vede> Trouble finding minerals? I walked into a single cave and found over twenty iron veins in just a couple days.
[12:42] <Factory> i live in coal city, but you want iron? too bad
[12:42] <vede> And mountains are like mountains of coal with stone veins.

[12:54] <Pharod42> Hmm. I respawned in lava due to the crash, and died. But I can't find any free lava around, so it seems to have respawned me in the spot I was in at crash, but with the blocks at the state they were at last time I saved.
[12:54] <Factory> your 11, working is illeagle
[12:54] <Flot> He told everyone he was going back to bed.
[12:54] <CyborgDragon> it...it...crashed....

[12:55] <CyborgDragon> that happens

[12:55] <Flot> Also, he canceled Minecraft and joined Activision
[12:55] <CyborgDragon> only your inventory and position autosave
[12:55] <LanternGhost> Looking at the forums there are a lot of really young kids here
[12:55] <DeandreT> I heard ridable minecarts were tommorw
[12:55] <Flot> "chesse"
[12:55] <LG_Legacy> New vg cats
[12:55] <CyborgDragon> today*
[12:55] <DeandreT> tommorow*
[12:55] <Flot> Definitely one of them.
[12:55] <Superwafflez> FLOT DONT YOU SAY THAT D:
[12:55] <DeandreT> Err today
[12:55] <Flot> But it's true.
[12:55] <LanternGhost> I heard Friday
[12:55] <Factory> k
[12:55] <Flot> Notch is Bobby Kotick's best friend.
[12:55] <DeandreT> You guys are imsomniacs
[12:55] <vede> LanternGhost, you didn't read the Notchtwitter.
[12:55] <Superwafflez> Yeah the forums are very err... how to put it...
[12:56] <DeandreT> insomniac*
[12:56] <vede> Superwafflez, saturated with ignoramuses?
[12:56] <Pharod42> Didn't lose much, I keep quitting to save it so I can reslice in Cartograph.
[12:56] <Flot> Minecraft will now be a Team Activision project, with the basic creative mode availible for free, and each progressive gamemode availible as DLC, for $15 each
[12:56] <Superwafflez> Yes!
[12:56] <DeandreT> Atleast you don't act like the TF2 community
[12:56] <Pharod42> Full stack of coal was the main thing, I think.
[12:56] <LanternGhost> Wait Flot it doesn't say when he is releasing rideable carts?
[12:56] <DeandreT> They whine about more updates after they get good ones.
[12:57] <Factory> so do we
[12:57] <Flot> I don't know why you're asking me, but he said friday.
[12:57] <Flot> After optimization.
[12:57] <LanternGhost> Oh
[12:57] <LanternGhost> I mean vede
[12:57] <LanternGhost> It doesn't say he is releasing it today
[12:57] <DeandreT> Factory, I never knew you played Minecraft.
[12:57] <CyborgDragon> lawl lg
[12:57] <CyborgDragon> funny
[12:58] <Superwafflez> So... minecraft runs much better now I hear.
[12:58] <LanternGhost> ?
[12:58] <Flot> Not yet.
[12:58] <Flot> The update isn't out yet.
[12:58] <Superwafflez> Well, the updated version.
[12:58] <Factory> im sure you dont know alot about me

[12:58] <DeandreT> Strelok plays it too, he has a stream that he normally does at like 8-12PM of Infdev.
[12:58] <vede> No no no, we whine about how every update showcases how Notch is a lazy bastard who really only cares about extending the development time to milk money out of the masses so he can abandon the project in a few months when everyone forgets about it.
[12:58] <LanternGhost> He his twitter says an updated version will come out today, but that does not mean its the rideable minecarts.
[12:58] <CyborgDragon> i'll be going along
[12:58] <CyborgDragon> when BAM
[12:58] <CyborgDragon> CRASH
[12:58] <CyborgDragon> i lose all progress in the world
[12:58] <CyborgDragon> but my inventory and position are saved
[12:58] <LanternGhost> It could just be the performance updates not the rideable minecarts.
[12:58] <CyborgDragon> so annoying
[12:58] <Superwafflez> Lantern, what's today for you?
[12:58] <Factory> i know
[12:58] <Pharod42> Shit, I also lost like 40 cart tracks.
[12:58] <Superwafflez> TIme zone?
[12:58] <LanternGhost> Thursday
[12:58] <vede> And how when he met that girl a few months ago Minecraft suddenly stopped being good and how all women are blood-sucking freaks who kill games.

[12:58] <Shadowfox> How do I make torches?
[12:58] <Shadowfox> in inFdev
[12:58] <LanternGhost> It is also Thursday were notch is at.
[12:59] <Pharod42> Coal and stick.
[12:59] <DeandreT> I remember when Firefox crashed, and it was when minecarts and tracks were just released and I made an awesome track.
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF------
[12:59] <vede> Same way as in indev, Shadowfox.
[12:59] <TotempaaltJ> You'll need stick
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> WHERES MY CART
[12:59] <TotempaaltJ> and coal
[12:59] <DeandreT> 30 minutes of epic track construction was gone
[12:59] <Shadowfox> damnit i can't find any coal veins
[12:59] <Pharod42> We really need justions.
[12:59] <Pharod42> Junctions.
[12:59] <DeandreT> I can never find iron
[12:59] <LanternGhost> I don't know about you guys but I am going to setup a train system when smp comes out.
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> all progress
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> lost
[12:59] <DeandreT> Coal is everywhere
[12:59] <Factory> 2am...im going
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> pharod
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> junctions are easy
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> i've made t-bones
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> lots of t-bones
[12:59] <Factory> goodbye
[12:59] <CyborgDragon> all it takes is a step block
[12:59] <DeandreT> bye
[13:00] <Pharod42> How, than?
[13:00] <TotempaaltJ> Why's the bot called BananaBot?
[13:00] <TotempaaltJ> Who thought of that?
[13:00] <Factory> it was fun notch,add me on steam
[13:00] <LanternGhost> Charge people an iron to ride on it or something.
[13:00] <Flot> You should have known better.
[13:00] <Flot> Silly.
[13:00] <Pharod42> I thought cart tracks don't work with step blocks.
[13:00] <CyborgDragon> pharod, TotempaaltJ> Noo
[13:00] <CyborgDragon> GRAH
[13:00] <CyborgDragon> copy didnt work
[13:00] <Budda> wat
[13:00] <TotempaaltJ> I DON'T KNOW.
[13:00] <TotempaaltJ> :P
[13:01] <Flot> Steam? If one person adds notch to steam, know what that means?
[13:01] <CyborgDragon> hate it when that happens
[13:01] <CyborgDragon> http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v620/CyborgDragon/Minecraft/tbonejunction.png
[13:01] <Flot> It means someone knows Notch's steam ID.
[13:01] <DeandreT> Just one piece of iron for a ride?
[13:01] <Flot> Hundreds of friend requests.
[13:01] <CyborgDragon> simple t-bone junction
[13:01] <Flot> The horror.
[13:01] <CyborgDragon> works great too
[13:01] <LanternGhost> Well DeandreT
[13:01] <DeandreT> I would charge 2 pieces of bread
[13:01] <LanternGhost> the idea is people will come back and use it more then once
[13:01] <TotempaaltJ> Why does this highlight Notch?
[13:01] <DeandreT> or a stone sword
[13:01] <LanternGhost> And not just one person will use it
[13:01] <LanternGhost> Stone swords are useless
[13:01] <DeandreT> I know
[13:01] <Flot> It highlights notch because there is a person named notch in this chat
[13:01] <LanternGhost> I could make one in a matter of minutes.
[13:01] <Flot> flot LanternGhost DeandreT
[13:01] <DeandreT> but MP Infdev noobs wouldn't know that
[13:02] <Flot> See?
[13:02] <TotempaaltJ> Ah yes.
[13:02] <TotempaaltJ> But he's idle
[13:02] <LanternGhost> Why is my name green/
[13:02] <LanternGhost> ?
[13:02] <LanternGhost> Oh
[13:02] <DeandreT> Scamming is gonna be easy without a currency
[13:02] <LG_Legacy> DeandreT ?
[13:02] <LanternGhost> Because it is giving me an indicator someone said my name.
[13:02] <DeandreT> ?
[13:02] <LG_Legacy> What about Notch?
[13:02] <LanternGhost> Scamming?
[13:02] <Flot> How on earth can you scam in minecraft.
[13:02] <LanternGhost> Why would you scam when you could just steal?
[13:02] <TotempaaltJ> Notch, why are you idle?
[13:02] <Flot> Everything is personal value, there's no way to get scammed!
[13:02] <LG_Legacy> You talking about how his name is yellow in normal servers?
[13:02] <TotempaaltJ> Come on!
[13:02] <DeandreT> Fine
[13:02] <LG_Legacy> Oh i see
[13:02] <LG_Legacy> I didn't even see him come in
[13:03] <Pharod42> Dragon, wouldn't that work without the block, too?
[13:03] <Flot> Because he came in before you
[13:03] <DeandreT> People still think Notch is gonna make dragons
[13:03] <LG_Legacy> Our creator is probably idling and chatting when he wants to.
[13:03] <LanternGhost> I might do a lot of stealing.
[13:03] <LanternGhost> And TNT base raiding.
[13:03] <DeandreT> This guy built a castle, and all the castle had was swords and armor.
[13:03] <Flot> Nah, none of those are the stuff.
[13:03] <CyborgDragon> pharod42, it would,but then you could accidentally push the cart out
[13:04] <CyborgDragon> plus the block makes it look nice
[13:04] <DeandreT> He said he was gonna raid dragons in MP infdev
[13:04] <DeandreT> lol
[13:04] <Flot> The real thing will be when notch adds crashing, where hitting an area too hard with a minecart will destroy it if it's made of dirt or wood. Ram-raiding houses.
[13:04] <LanternGhost> I thought notch said he was never going to add dragons
[13:04] <TotempaaltJ> he difd
[13:04] <vede> TotempaaltJ, he can code and get the update out today or he can talk to us.
[13:04] <Budda> dirt cart, wat
[13:04] <LanternGhost> That doesn't mean we won't have a phoenix!
[13:04] <DeandreT> That was the joke Lantern
[13:04] <Pharod42> But you could swap in onto the 'wrong' track anyway, carts are all over the place when you push them off tracks.
[13:04] <Flot> If the area it hits is made of dirt or wood, silly.
[13:04] <DeandreT> Someone told the guy there were gonna huge dragons
[13:04] <Flot> The cart is made of iron.
[13:05] <DeandreT> pssh
[13:05] <LanternGhost> Meh
[13:05] <CyborgDragon> pharod42, you get the hang of using those t-bones really fast
[13:05] <TotempaaltJ> Yeah.
[13:05] <DeandreT> I make my carts out of lava
[13:05] <TotempaaltJ> I say talk to us
[13:05] <LanternGhost> I want enemies to be able to break blocks first
[13:05] <CyborgDragon> i never accidentally go onto the wrong rail any more
[13:05] <TotempaaltJ> Anyway
[13:05] <CyborgDragon> i did a few times at first
[13:05] <CyborgDragon> but not any more
[13:05] <TotempaaltJ> I'll brb
[13:05] * TotempaaltJ (Mibbit@145.120.73.178) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[13:05] <Flot> Every second notch takes the time out of his day to talk to us is a second that you delay survival multiplayer
[13:06] <LanternGhost> So?
[13:06] <LanternGhost> I can wait
[13:06] <DeandreT> same
[13:06] <DeandreT> Its not like it would come too soon anyways
[13:06] <LanternGhost> I want some new enemy types though :\
[13:06] <DeandreT> It will take a while to code MP
[13:06] <LanternGhost> And biomes
[13:06] <LanternGhost> Personally I would be happy with just that
[13:06] <Flot> Yeah, except that Survival multiplayer is already going to come out in summer 2013
[13:06] <Flot> You want it later?
[13:06] <LanternGhost> and it was all working and well.

[13:06] <DeandreT> Yes
[13:06] <Flot> It won't be.
[13:06] <DeandreT> Flot
[13:06] <Flot> It'll be buggy, because notch spent all his time talking to you!
[13:06] <DeandreT> why do you go here?
[13:07] <Budda> to troll
[13:07] <Budda> durr
[13:07] <Flot> Why do you?
[13:07] <DeandreT> this is my first time
[13:07] <DeandreT> In an IRC
[13:07] <LanternGhost> More enemies would just be great and having different types of environments would make it perfect.
[13:07] <DeandreT> ever
[13:07] <Budda> irc virgin
[13:07] <Sparky20> do minecarts float down rivers?
[13:07] <Flot> They're entities, they should.
[13:07] <Sparky20> on curents?
[13:08] <DeandreT> They float down currents
[13:08] <DeandreT> on currents
[13:08] <CyborgDragon> minecarts do
[13:08] <Flot> The current is the moving water, they can float on a current too
[13:08] <CyborgDragon> just really really slowly
[13:08] <DeandreT> I hope he adds boats by the time MP infdev is released
[13:08] <LanternGhost> I thought MP was not going to be on infdev maps?
[13:08] <LanternGhost> I thought he was going to have large maps but not the size of infdev.
[13:08] <DeandreT> Why wouldn't it.
[13:09] <LanternGhost> Server issues I would guess
[13:09] <Budda> what issues
[13:09] <LanternGhost> Huge map with 16 players or more on it
[13:09] <Budda> so?
[13:09] <LanternGhost> all exploring it in different directions
[13:09] <CyborgDragon> better make sure the server has lots of space
[13:09] <Flot> You mean like creative?
[13:09] <Budda> so?
[13:09] <Flot> Except with less players, because creative houses 32?
[13:09] <LanternGhost> Lots of space required for one map after a long time
[13:09] <CyborgDragon> actually flot
[13:09] <DeandreT> If people are gonna host
[13:09] <LanternGhost> Also
[13:09] <Pharod42> Diamond pick still doesn't break adminium, dragon.
[13:09] <CyborgDragon> creative can house up to 255
[13:09] <Flot> Yeah, with lag.
[13:09] <LanternGhost> It would suck so bad trying to find people
[13:09] <Budda> LanternGhost, i think someone worked out that even with the max-size map, it wont even be a couple of GB
[13:09] <Flot> 32 is recommended.
[13:09] <DeandreT> They might aswell just give up like 5GB to host a server
[13:10] <CyborgDragon> but the vanilla is max at 32
[13:10] <LanternGhost> Oh.
[13:10] <LanternGhost> I thought it would be much larger
[13:10] <CyborgDragon> uhh budda
[13:10] <LanternGhost> Also finding other players will be an issue in an infdev map.
[13:10] <CyborgDragon> notch said that a fully explored infdev map
[13:10] <Budda> well, maybe since he doesnt compress them now...
[13:10] <CyborgDragon> would be 8petabytes in size
[13:10] <Budda> wat
[13:10] <LanternGhost> I mean look at the size of one the map.
[13:10] <Flot> But that doesn't matter, because it would take millions of years to explore infinity
[13:10] <Flot> Well, techical infinity.
[13:10] <CyborgDragon> that is in the current format
[13:10] <LanternGhost> Now imagine trying to find other players in that size of map
[13:10] <DeandreT> I would hope it would be atleast 200 max and people would normally average at 64
[13:11] <Flot> Lantern, the players will all spawn in the same place.
[13:11] <vede> Flot, it would take infinite years to explore infinity.
[13:11] <LanternGhost> I could pretty much be playing infdev solo with a chat feature included because I would have a lot of problems trying to find other players
[13:11] <Flot> No, technical infinity.
[13:11] <vede> Fortunately, there's nothing infinite about Minecraft's levels.
[13:11] <Flot> Infdev is not truly infinite.
[13:11] <CyborgDragon> flot
[13:11] <DeandreT> Could you imagine 100 v 100 battles????
[13:11] <DeandreT> It would be epic
[13:11] <CyborgDragon> quit making up terms
[13:11] <LanternGhost> Not going to happen though
[13:11] <CyborgDragon> "technical infinity"
[13:12] <Flot> Technical infinity is technical infinity. It's infinity by most people's standards, but technically, it's not truly infinite.
[13:12] <LanternGhost> I don't know I just see myself having problems find other players
[13:12] <DeandreT> 8 times bigger than earth
[13:12] <CyborgDragon> you're using the term techinbcal wrong there flot
[13:12] <CyborgDragon> technical*
[13:12] <LanternGhost> Removing the whole multiplayer element to the whole idea of it.
[13:12] <Budda> infinity is not infinite by your standards then Flot
[13:12] <DeandreT> You will not seriously have the time to do that
[13:12] <Flot> Oh, sorry. It's late. I'm getting my words messed up.
[13:12] <quaxar> Actually I will
[13:12] <quaxar> because I AM IMMORTAL
[13:12] <vede> Flot, if it has an end, it's not infinite by any measure of the term. At all.
[13:12] <quaxar> I HAVE INSIDE ME BLOOD OF KINGS
[13:12] <vede> Not "technical infinity" or anything else.
[13:12] <LanternGhost> Also I want notch to make spawn flags for infdev
[13:12] <Flot> There is no such thing as infinity in space, so yeah.
[13:13] <vede> If it has a definite stopping point at all, it's finite, period.
[13:13] <Budda> we dont know that
[13:13] <DeandreT> I am sorry, if you run something 8 times bigger than Earth, you have failed at life and should end it now
[13:13] <quaxar> uh
[13:13] <Budda> spce might be infinite
[13:13] <Budda> we cant tell
[13:13] <quaxar> there is such thing as infinity in space
[13:13] <Flot> Budda, there is an end to everything.
[13:13] <Budda> since we cant see it
[13:13] <quaxar> there is a infinite distance between me and you
[13:13] <LanternGhost> it would be 3 stick running down the right side and in the top space wool.
[13:13] <quaxar> right now
[13:13] <Flot> Budda, if that's true then there is a planet made of spaghetti.
[13:13] <LanternGhost> Place the spawn flag and you will spawn there when you die
[13:13] <quaxar> between 1 and 2
[13:13] <Flot> You can't see it though.
[13:13] <quaxar> is infinity
[13:13] <Budda> Flot, your point?
[13:13] <CyborgDragon> well
[13:14] <CyborgDragon> back to remaking my mob trap
[13:14] <DeandreT> Spawn is random when server is started
[13:14] <LanternGhost> Yes DeandreT
[13:14] <CyborgDragon> since java had to go and die on me
[13:14] <CyborgDragon> and my world didnt save
[13:14] <Sparky20> The
[13:14] <Flot> There is no scientific evidence to support infinity in space.
[13:14] <LanternGhost> but its a bit annoying when you run off far and make a base and die.
[13:14] <Sparky20> Game
[13:14] <CyborgDragon> but a nice bonus is
[13:14] <DeandreT> and it can change every 2 hours atleast 200 blocks away
[13:14] <Sparky20> Hahahahaha.
[13:14] <CyborgDragon> i got a free diamond pickaxe from the crash
[13:14] <Budda> Flot, if space is finite, what is at the end?
[13:14] * iTouch (ikjames@cblmdm72-241-129-156.buckeyecom.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:14] <Flot> Nothing.
[13:14] <LanternGhost> You spawn far away from the base and I would probably lose my base
[13:14] <Flot> That's the end.
[13:14] <DeandreT> I would like that
[13:14] <Budda> an adminium wall?
[13:14] <vede> Flot, you don't really know what you're talking about, do you?
[13:14] <Budda> Flot, my point is you could keep going
[13:14] <LanternGhost> Also has anyone ever thought of stealing someone else base?
[13:14] * iTouch (ikjames@cblmdm72-241-129-156.buckeyecom.net) has left #minecraft
[13:15] <Budda> there might not be anything there
[13:15] <LanternGhost> Just kill them and use there base as your own?
[13:15] <Budda> but you could still go there
[13:15] <Flot> The end implies you stop or move onto something else.
[13:15] <LG_Legacy> I hate demo's in KF :l
[13:15] <DeandreT> Think of it like this, the OP can choose whether they want to have spawn change: set amount of block every: set amount of time
[13:15] <Flot> So the end of the finite universe implies there's something else beyond it, or nothing at all.
[13:15] <Budda> but if theres nothing
[13:15] <Budda> whats stopping you going out there?
[13:15] <Pharod42> I had some problems iwth finding my base upon death, so now I just build at or near my spawn.
[13:15] <Budda> nothing
[13:15] <Budda> so you keep going

[13:16] <Flot> What if there is?

[13:17] <Budda> well no shit
[13:17] <DeandreT> OP can set the difficulty
[13:17] <Budda> cause there is no edge
[13:17] <Budda> well
[13:17] <Flot> No need to be rude, kid.
[13:17] <Budda> there might not be
[13:17] <Budda> nobody knows
[13:17] <Pharod42> I wonder if someone is still running a client where you could fall out of the world, just to see if anything happens eventually.
[13:17] <vede> Flot, there's a massive problem in your argument here.
[13:17] * Factory (yaaic@cpe-66-75-48-132.san.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[13:17] <DeandreT> OP can set difficulty or it can be set by the amount of players
[13:17] <Pharod42> By vote, you mean, Dean?
[13:18] <DeandreT> or vote
[13:18] <Budda> Flot, since the universe is expanding, what do you suppose it is expanding into, if there is a limit to the universe?
[13:18] <DeandreT> I mean amount of players as in the more players the harder it gets
[13:18] <DeandreT> Or it could be set by the amount of the map explored
[13:18] <DeandreT> The further out explored the harder it gets
[13:18] <DeandreT> Much like EvE
[13:18] <Pharod42> By harder do you mean mor mobs or tougher mobs?
[13:19] <Flot> The universe is the universe, not what's beyond it. If we've never been into what's beyond the universe, that supposed state of nothingness, then we can't say anything about it. It could be finite or infinte.
[13:19] <Pharod42> Or harder blocks or summat.
[13:19] <DeandreT> Yes, and when the map is explored more the difficulty will change automatically
[13:19] <Budda> Flot, then what defines the edge of the universe
[13:19] <vede> Flot, if you're going to say that the "it's infinite" argument is wrong because no one knows if it's infinite or not, then just stop arguing, because you don't know if it's finite or not.
[13:19] <MartyChang> maybe you could have monsters that spawn only on higher difficulties
[13:19] <MartyChang> like golems or something
[13:19] <DeandreT> Golems lol
[13:19] <MartyChang> dude golems would be cool
[13:19] <Sparky20> Boom, the galaxy hits the edge of the universe and bounces off.
[13:19] <Budda> its like the whole god argument 'YOU CANT PROVE IT SO ILL BELIEVE WHAT I WANT'
[13:19] <MartyChang> especially if they were in caves
[13:19] <Flot> No one knows. But everything has an end that we know, why not the universe too?
[13:20] <vede> "You can't possibly know that you are correct, so I am correct." <-- essentially what you're saying
[13:20] <Flot> Why assume that the universe is infinite just because we've never seen the end of it?
[13:20] <Flot> That's a big assumption.
[13:20] <Budda> its an even bigger assumption to say that there is a defined limit
[13:20] <Pharod42> Flot, minecraft channel here, not dicussion on the nature of infinity.
[13:20] <MartyChang> the universe isn't infinite but it's so incomprehensibly large that it might as well be
[13:20] <DeandreT> I still wait for the day Notch adds mobs that are extremely hard and only killable with like 5 people (MP Infdev) that drops up to 128 blocks of iron and 20 pieces of diamond
[13:20] <vede> Flot, once again, you've seen a hole in one stance and automatically assumed that the opposite stance is correct.
[13:20] <MartyChang> so there, fuck you
[13:20] <Budda> especially since it is constantly expanding
[13:21] <vede> "There's a problem with A so B is correct." without properly considering what sort of problems B has.
[13:21] <MartyChang> DeandreT: dude that'd be awesome
[13:21] <DeandreT> Maybe like a monster that is extremely rare but only found in caves
[13:21] <MartyChang> boss creatures would be really cool
[13:21] <DeandreT> a lava monster
[13:21] <MartyChang> like a dinosaur
[13:21] <Pharod42> Can't it be both, anyway? It's infinite and finite until someone works out how to look and see which it is?
[13:21] <DeandreT> If it gets near a lava spring it can regenerate 50% of its health
[13:21] <Flot> Then what do you have to stand on for infinity's side then?
[13:21] <Mattress> Rock lobster
[13:21] <Budda> there is no way to look
[13:21] <Flot> That it's really really big?
[13:21] <vede> Flot, I'm not taking a side.
[13:22] <Budda> if there is an edge, it'll be far past our possible viewing limits

[13:23] <MartyChang> I think what's important to note is that scientists have predicted that there's a large portion of the universe that we can't observe simply because the universe hasn't been around long enough for the light to get here
[13:23] <Pharod42> If it's infinite noone can ever check, and it's moot anyway. It only actually matters to humans if it's finite.
[13:23] <DeandreT> It would probably take months to years to reach the end
[13:23] <MartyChang> DeandreT: DESERT MINE
[13:23] <LanternGhost> quickly
[13:23] <MartyChang> it's like Desert Bus
[13:23] <LanternGhost> tell me something
[13:23] <Pharod42> ie. if there a border of some kind.
[13:23] <LanternGhost> anything
[13:23] <MartyChang> except in minecraft
[13:23] <DeandreT> If I told you the universe we live in was infinite.. could you believe me?
[13:23] <DeandreT> Yes
[13:23] <Pharod42> Marty: YES.
[13:23] <DeandreT> but If I told you it was finite could you believe me?
[13:23] <DeandreT> yes
[13:24] <DeandreT> but do I know??
[13:24] <DeandreT> No
[13:24] <Flot> I believe science. Not people.
[13:24] <LanternGhost> I want a desert mine
[13:24] <LanternGhost> I also want a snowy mine
[13:24] <Budda> science is the creation of people
[13:24] <Pharod42> And does it matter to humans? Also no.
[13:24] <LanternGhost> Imagine climbing a tall peak covered in snow
[13:24] <MartyChang> it'd be easy to write a script to manipulate a minecraft character to walk autonomously
[13:24] <LanternGhost> Ok wait,
[13:24] <MartyChang> actually
[13:24] <MartyChang> wait
[13:24] <MartyChang> not really
[13:24] <LanternGhost> Notch should have special items you need to each biome.
[13:24] <Mattress> 02:22:37 [DeandreT] Maybe someone should just stream everyday, where they walk the same way for days
[13:24] <Mattress> 02:22:46 [DeandreT] I would watch it
[13:24] <LanternGhost> Such as in the desert the sand blocks your vision partly
[13:24] <MartyChang> because you'd have to write a pathfinder so that your character doesn't walk up the side of a mountain and jump to his death
[13:24] <Flot> Need to each biome? What do you mean?
[13:24] <lmaobot> Notch, I think you should look into moving Dungeons and Levers to a higher priority. Those sorts of interactive components lead to emergent gameplay, which vastly increases replayibility
[13:24] <DeandreT> You guys remember the huge brick pyramid in early version of Infdev
[13:24] <Mattress> Equip themselves with diamond picks and shovels in just walk in a straight line forever
[13:24] * RaidSoft (raid@hd5e272a0.gavlegardarna.gavle.to) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[13:25] <LanternGhost> Like the desert its sandy and its hard to see. You craft a scarf to keep the sand out of your eyes.
[13:25] <Pharod42> Ohh, that could work, mattress.
[13:25] <Flot> That sounds cumbersome.
[13:25] <Flot> You'd need an item for every different biome?
[13:25] <LanternGhost> Well it would be easy to make
[13:25] <LanternGhost> Some wool for the scarf
[13:25] <Pharod42> But you'd run out no matter what you packed.
[13:25] <Superwafflez> DeandreT, yeah.
[13:25] <LanternGhost> Snow one its cold and you move a bit slower in the cold
[13:25] <LanternGhost> So you craft a coat or something
[13:25] <Pharod42> Is Aquatic a biome for this dicussion?
[13:25] <DeandreT> Was pretty fun to hollow it out
[13:25] <Superwafflez> haha
[13:25] <LanternGhost> I don't know might be a neat little thing
[13:25] <MartyChang> well, I imagine there will be giant oceans
[13:25] <DeandreT> wtf
[13:26] <MartyChang> so sure
[13:26] <DeandreT> there is someone named out here
[13:26] <lmaobot> I think different Biomes should have different resources exclusive to them so that so players can spread out and trade with each other
[13:26] <MartyChang> ^
[13:26] <MartyChang> that would be awesome
[13:26] <vede> Biome-specific monsters would be cool. Even if the only difference was textures.
[13:26] <LanternGhost> I agree with imaobot and vede.
[13:26] <LanternGhost> Maybe each biome has some random disaster / effect that occurs every once and awhile
[13:26] <Pharod42> Hey, wouldn't you need cold-generation devices to mine ice?
[13:26] <LanternGhost> such as in the desert a sand storm occurs
[13:27] <Mattress> Oh god
[13:27] <MartyChang> deserts could have scorpions coconuts
[13:27] <MartyChang> or something
[13:27] <LanternGhost> If you don't make it to cover you lose some hp or something
[13:27] <Superwafflez> pickaxes work on ice as far as I can recall
[13:27] * Asmageddon (asmageddon@static-22-196-112-85.radom.pilicka.pl) has joined #minecraft
[13:27] <MartyChang> scorpions and coconuts
[13:27] <Mattress> Running away from a huge cube of yellow
[13:27] <LanternGhost> Sand worms
[13:27] <DeandreT> Even if there was no currency and just bartering, I'm sure alot of people would use coal and/or Iron as a currency like object
[13:27] <Pharod42> Not to get ice blocks, but so it doesn't melf from body heat and so on.
[13:27] <LanternGhost> Well Mattress it would be a particle effect
[13:27] <DeandreT> Omfg
[13:27] <LanternGhost> Like rain
[13:27] <Pharod42> And flood on you.
[13:27] <DeandreT> I just got the greatest Idea!!!
[13:27] <lmaobot> Ice could be used to carry water
[13:27] <LanternGhost> What
[13:27] <Mattress> Imagine a gigantic version of the clouds
[13:27] <Pharod42> We do have raid you can see in on creative.
[13:27] <Superwafflez> does the rain at sea level bug still exist?
[13:27] <Pharod42> Rain.
[13:28] <Mattress> But yeah, particles would be cool too
[13:28] <LanternGhost> I really like the idea of different resources in each biome
[13:28] * TVC (TVC@115-64-85-159.static.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[13:28] <MartyChang> same
[13:28] <LanternGhost> and it would make a lot of sense to have people spread out
[13:28] <LanternGhost> I kind of want an outfit slot also :\
[13:28] <Pharod42> Like purified sand in deserts, maybe?
[13:28] <LanternGhost> Well I guess that's what skins are for
[13:28] <LanternGhost> so nevermind about that
[13:28] <Flot> Purified sand?
[13:28] <lmaobot> Mountains could have rarer ores
[13:28] <LanternGhost> No Pharod
[13:28] <Superwafflez> notch needs to work on file size for multiplayer...
[13:28] <Mattress> Have like a jumpsuit slot and then an oversuit slot
[13:28] <MartyChang> deserts could have... oil?
[13:28] <LanternGhost> like in the desert you could fine some rare herb around an oasis
[13:29] <Superwafflez> oil is too modern for minecraft D:
[13:29] <Pharod42> Would it be farmable?
[13:29] <Mattress> Palm trees instead of the pine/whatever
[13:29] <LanternGhost> Well Mattress I mean like craftable clothing such as a hat or a scarf.
[13:29] <LanternGhost> But we could do most of that with skins.
[13:29] <lmaobot> Cactus blocks that damage you when you touch them
[13:29] <DeandreT> Ok for a auction house in MP Infdev, players could drop their stuff into a little fountain like stage thing and all of the objects go down a little hole into a room where the auctioneer sells them and gives the buyers the thing they bought and put the sellers bought objects into a minecart push it up into the stage, and give the sellers their items
[13:29] <Budda> Superwafflez: cause they didn't dump hot oil over the walls of castles onto attackers in the middle ages?
[13:29] <vede> Superwafflez, uh, oil is less modern than TNT.
[13:29] <LanternGhost> OH YES
[13:29] <Vis{anus|head}> Hm
[13:29] <DeandreT> So sellers send it down
[13:29] <Vis{anus|head}> oh my
[13:29] <LanternGhost> Running cactus enemies!
[13:29] <Vis{anus|head}> I'm still Anus head
[13:29] <Superwafflez> hmm maybe
[13:29] <DeandreT> Buyers send it up
[13:29] * Vis{anus|head} is now known as Visiiri
[13:29] <Mattress> Signs signify who's the owner of each item in the auction
[13:30] <Visiiri> dewd, vede, you're above me on the list now D;
[13:30] <Mattress> People could edit signs next to them to bid
[13:30] * Asmageddon (asmageddon@static-22-196-112-85.radom.pilicka.pl) has left #minecraft
[13:30] <DeandreT> Yep
[13:30] <vede> Muahaha Visiiri.
[13:30] <Pharod42> What would stop perople killing the auctioneer, or the auctioneer keeping the stuff if you couldn't get down there.
[13:30] <Visiiri> ;.;
[13:30] * Visiiri is now known as [Visiiri]
[13:30] <[Visiiri]> Now I own all
[13:30] <Mattress> Society would stop them
[13:30] * Sparky20 is away: Busy
[13:30] <vede> Nope.
[13:30] <DeandreT> Trust
[13:30] <LanternGhost> We don't need an auction house
[13:30] <vede> I'm still above you, Visiiri.
[13:30] <DeandreT> Trust would stop them
[13:30] <[Visiiri]> D:
[13:30] <Pharod42> Hehehe, 'trust'.
[13:30] <LanternGhost> people will just make trading systems or something
[13:30] * [Visiiri] is now known as Visiiri
[13:30] <Mattress> lol
[13:30] <Mattress> srs rp Minecraft servers
[13:30] <Flot> It's not hard to trade with what we have
[13:30] <Flot> Drop items, walk to them
[13:30] <DeandreT> If they steal we kill them
[13:30] <vede> /nick Vasiiri
[13:31] <Visiiri> noes
[13:31] <DeandreT> It would be cool to build a stormwind like castle
[13:31] <DeandreT> I always loved that design in WoW
[13:31] <LanternGhost> Make sure you have some guards when you trade
[13:31] <LanternGhost> or go to a save place to trade
[13:31] <Mattress> I liked the puptent idea someone had on the forums
[13:31] <lmaobot> I also want glowing crystals that can be used to make permanent light sources
[13:31] <MartyChang> that reminds me
[13:31] <Pharod42> Yeah, but also need extesive quarries somewhere else. So for every stormwind there'd be a Mordor.
[13:32] <MartyChang> could notch do colored lighting perhaps?
[13:32] <DeandreT> I like my torches D;
[13:32] <LanternGhost> I like torches also
[13:32] <DeandreT> Yes
[13:32] <DeandreT> dye the torches
[13:32] <LanternGhost> I want a carryable light source like Notch said he would
[13:32] <LanternGhost> add
[13:32] <DeandreT> He still has to add dyes
[13:32] <MartyChang> no, I mean as in torches give a yellowish light
[13:32] <Pharod42> I'd like underwater torches even temporary ones.
[13:32] <LanternGhost> why would we need dyes?
[13:32] <LanternGhost> dyes for blocks or something?
[13:32] <Visiiri> Notch: I vote high-peak FPS
[13:32] <MartyChang> a glowing crystal could give a blue light
[13:32] <Flot> For decoration, yes.
[13:32] <DeandreT> I thought of making a mining light, instead of a helmet.
[13:32] <Flot> And stained glass <3
[13:32] <MartyChang> Notch: I vote smoothness
[13:32] <LanternGhost> So the dyes would be used on weapons and things?
[13:32] <LanternGhost> And blocks?
[13:33] <Pharod42> It'd healp sinking pylons for my bridges.
[13:33] <lmaobot> Notch said torches won't always be permanent, so magic crystals are a good alternate
[13:33] <Pharod42> Help.
[13:33] * Darkflux (Darkflux@CPE-124-191-34-48.mxzn1.win.bigpond.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[13:33] <LanternGhost> Hmm
[13:33] <LanternGhost> That could be a problam lmaobot
[13:33] <LanternGhost> inless he makes another light source that is permanent
[13:33] <Pharod42> Come to think of it crystal probably would work underwater.
[13:33] <DeandreT> You replace the coal piece in the mining light ever 30 minutes, and it is a replacement for a helm. It has 20% of getting put out in combat and 70% of going out while swimming
[13:33] <Flot> I hope that there is at least one source of infinite light that is semi-common.
[13:33] <Flot> It's going to be annoying if we have infinite light sources, but they're slightly less rare than diamond
[13:34] <Visiiri> DeandreT: Fire on your head = bad idea
[13:34] <LanternGhost> Mining lights seem cool
[13:34] <Mattress> [Flot] I hope that there is at least one source of infinite light that is semi-common.
[13:34] <Mattress> Lava
[13:34] <Pharod42> Dean, 70% checked how often?
[13:34] <DeandreT> Everytime you go in water
[13:34] <DeandreT> under
[13:34] <Flot> Yeah, but lava is annoying to manipulate. You'd have to carve out a pool for it every time you want light.
[13:34] <lmaobot> Underground also should have it's own diverse lifeforms, like fungi, cave lobsters, myconds, bioluminecent creatures, etc.
[13:34] <MartyChang> ^
[13:34] <LanternGhost> Having a light source you can take with you will be great because if you find a cave and have no use for it other then the ore you don't need to put up torches everywere.
[13:34] <MartyChang> caves should be a biome in themselves
[13:34] <LanternGhost> Also I agree lmaobot
[13:35] <Pharod42> Torches help mark where you've been in a cave, too.
[13:35] <MartyChang> also, jungles?
[13:35] <LanternGhost> I agree with Marty on that also
[13:35] <Flot> Monsters will spawn in caves you don't put torches in. That's reason enough for me.
[13:35] <Mattress> You'd have to carry internals with you when you exlplored exotic caves
[13:35] <lmaobot> I want caves to be more Underdark/Journey to the Center of the Earth
[13:35] <LanternGhost> I mean it might be cool to have the cave biome different depending on the biome that its located in
[13:35] <Flot> I thought they were like that already.
[13:35] <LanternGhost> but that its to much work
[13:35] <DeandreT> Obsidian Armor-Protects against lava for 30 minutes submerged. A bit less in strength than diamond.
[13:35] <LanternGhost> o.o
[13:36] <LanternGhost> What would be the use though Deandre
[13:36] <LanternGhost> Hey guys I can stand in lava
[13:36] <DeandreT> It slows you down by 10%
[13:36] <Flot> But who on earth spends thirty minutes in lava.
[13:36] <DeandreT> idk
[13:36] <Mattress> That's some pretty intense heat dissapation
[13:36] <DeandreT> someone who falls in alot
[13:36] <Flot> The trade-off is worse than what you gain from it.
[13:36] <MartyChang> Flot: people who mine for diamond?
[13:36] <lmaobot> My idea was to have different templates for caves that are connected by tunnels, sort of like Incursion
[13:36] <Flot> I fall in lava for a few seconds, not thirty minutes.
[13:36] <DeandreT> I find my diamond near lava always
[13:36] <DeandreT> It adds up
[13:36] <Flot> Not for thirty minutes.
[13:36] <Flot> I'm not that clumsy.
[13:37] <DeandreT> lol
[13:37] <Sparky20> concealed lava waterfall entrance?
[13:37] <Sparky20> Obsidian Armor-Protects against lava for 30 minutes submerged.
[13:37] <LanternGhost> I make all my bases concealed by water
[13:37] <LanternGhost> :3
[13:37] <Sparky20> WIN^
[13:37] <Pharod42> I'd like there to be floating islands one reachable with armor made of the stuff that makes them float, which would itself be hard to get. It'd be found deep underground, otherwise it'd just force it's way out to the surface.
[13:37] <Flot> I make all my bases with giant fortress walls around it, like a city.
[13:37] <LanternGhost> I almost always put a waterfall over the entrance
[13:37] <vede> I have a decorative waterfall in a room in my cave, and if you go down the waterfall you end up in my actual base. :D
[13:37] <LanternGhost> so no one will really look for it there
[13:37] <Flot> I'm gonna cry when I have to ugly up my down with moats because of slimes.
[13:37] <Flot> town*
[13:37] <LanternGhost> That is another good idea vede
[13:37] <lmaobot> Oh, arctic areas should have ice caves.

[13:38] <LanternGhost> But I like having it behind a waterfall as it can be hard to spot if you set it up correctly
[13:38] <LanternGhost> YES
[13:38] <LanternGhost> Yetis <3
[13:38] <Sparky20> how many blocks of water are needed to stop an arrow?
[13:38] <lmaobot> And woolly creepers!
[13:38] <Flot> I didn't know arrows are slowed down by water.
[13:38] <DeandreT> the world may never know
[13:38] <Pharod42> I think yetis could be a kind of gentle giant mob.
[13:38] <LanternGhost> lol
[13:38] <LanternGhost> I think they would kill you on sight
[13:38] <Flot> I've never seen a giant that was gentle.
[13:38] <LanternGhost> imagine
[13:38] <LanternGhost> a snow storm hit and visibly is low
[13:38] <DeandreT> he has to add snow first
[13:39] <LanternGhost> you hear the sound of roars and grumbling as the yeti is close
[13:39] <LanternGhost> out of no were the yeti charges with its bright red eyes on visible.
[13:39] <DeandreT> They are very slow but do high damage
[13:39] <Flot> Will notch ever add a fast mob, like the old zombie?
[13:39] <LanternGhost> bright red eyes only visible
[13:39] <Pharod42> Maybe there could be 'savage' yetis and 'tribal' yetis, who are somewhate less violent.
[13:39] <DeandreT> and if there are snowy rocks nearby he can throw them
[13:39] <Pharod42> They just seem more intelligent than most other mobs.
[13:39] <LanternGhost> I would like to visit a tribe of yetis
[13:39] <DeandreT> It makes it harder to have a cabin in winter
[13:40] <LanternGhost> I want to see more sea monster though :\
[13:40] <DeandreT> Yetis are friendly at night but aggressive during the day
[13:40] <DeandreT> nah
[13:40] <DeandreT> doesn't sound right
[13:40] <MartyChang> desert biome-specific monsters: Scorpions and scarabs. Scorpions are fast but do little damage, scarabs are slow but do more damage. Both drop chitin when killed, which can be used to craft armor.
[13:40] <Flot> Why would yetis be friendly at night when everything else isn't?
[13:40] <LanternGhost> Walrus anyone?
[13:40] <DeandreT> I know
[13:41] <DeandreT> Thats why I said doesn't sound right
[13:41] <Pharod42> Hey, whould heat and cold conduct? Like if you have a thin walled cabin in the snow, your indoor well sometimes freezes?
[13:41] <LanternGhost> Walrus in the snow biome
[13:41] <lmaobot> Biomes themselves could have different effects, like grain would grow faster in the plains, or water would freeze in arctic.

[13:41] <LanternGhost> that's a good idea lmaobot
[13:41] <Flot> Minecraft has always been simple, I think the concept of insulation is a bit too complex for it.
[13:41] <DeandreT> Walrus- Tamable and ridable pet when too close to baby walrus Mother walrus becomes agressive.
[13:41] <Pharod42> And it'd be done by height or relation to spawn or what?
[13:41] <MartyChang> walruses could be slow but be able to swim in the water, when you kill them they drop blubber.
[13:41] <DeandreT> They can be bred
[13:42] <LanternGhost> but they would each have to have an advantage and disadvantage.
[13:42] <MartyChang> You can use blubber as a heat source. :D
[13:42] <LanternGhost> Blubber as a way to start fires?
[13:42] <Pharod42> And to make soap.
[13:42] <MartyChang> blubber could be a coal analog
[13:42] <MartyChang> but found only in icy biomes
[13:42] <DeandreT> If it is too warm for the Walrus they will slowly die, but can be contained in cold areas
[13:42] <LanternGhost> But each biome should have an advantage and a disadvantage.
[13:42] <Flot> Why would a secondary coal be needed unless coal wasn't available everywhere?
[13:42] <lmaobot> Water without a source would evaporate in a desert, plains would have much in the lines of resources, it would be a low risk, low reward area
[13:42] <Pharod42> Oh, and sheep/pigs should be tamable, for extra harvest moon goodness.
[13:42] <LanternGhost> Maybe Flot your low on coal
[13:43] <LanternGhost> And you are in the cold biome
[13:43] <Flot> Low? On coal? HAHAHA
[13:43] <DeandreT> Well lets say you want a house in some icy cold place
[13:43] <DeandreT> you cant find coal there
[13:43] <Pharod42> Which is hard to mine in for various reasons.
[13:43] <DeandreT> But you can find walrus
[13:43] <MartyChang> Flot: I'm thinking that the ice biome would have a thick sheet of ice below the actual rock preventing extensive mining
[13:43] * copyboy (copyboy@p5B31DA42.dip.t-dialin.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:43] <Flot> Well, Freezecraft doesn't sound too bad
[13:43] <Pharod42> Any you could make ivory decorations, too.
[13:43] <LanternGhost> Wait MartyChang would you still be able to mine?
[13:43] <MartyChang> anyway blubber could be better than coal but it's rare since it's the ice biome's region-specific resource
[13:44] <LanternGhost> Or would it just take longer to mine?
[13:44] <DeandreT> He needs to add a compass if he is gonna add different areas like the cold north and stuff
[13:44] <MartyChang> LanternGhost: yeah but mining through the layer of ice would take a while
[13:44] <MartyChang> ice would be just as hard as rock to penetrate
[13:44] <quaxar> Minecraft meets morrowind
[13:44] <LanternGhost> Ah
[13:44] <Flot> People would do it if they could.
[13:44] <Pharod42> Would lava in the open in a cold biome turn to cobble by itself.
[13:44] <quaxar> notch needs to add cliffracers
[13:44] <Visiiri> Fuck
[13:44] <Visiiri> I knew it
[13:44] <LanternGhost> Maybe DeandreT
[13:44] <LanternGhost> Draw on on paper
[13:44] <LanternGhost> lol
[13:44] <lmaobot> Maybe you could use the tail from a desert scorpion as a poisonous weapon?
[13:44] <Visiiri> I am stuck in the CS:S beta
[13:44] <Flot> Mining is safer and quicker than fighting fat land fishes.
[13:44] <DeandreT> If you are in Ice areas you can just use ice picks

[13:44] <quaxar> cliff racers
[13:44] <LanternGhost> No thanks
[13:45] <Perry> since all the source games work on w7, I assume CS:S will too?
[13:45] <MartyChang> Flot: Maybe blubber could be a more efficient version of coal in exchange for being rare
[13:45] <Flot> Of course.
[13:45] <DeandreT> yes
[13:45] <Perry> because it's $6.80 for today and tomorrow :D

[13:45] <MartyChang> Perry: CSS works perfectly on my Windows 7 install
[13:45] <Flot> I'm thinking that mining should be completely prohibited in the ice biome.
[13:45] <DeandreT> We have good ideas
[13:45] <MartyChang> I bought it last night
[13:45] <Perry> alright.
[13:45] <DeandreT> we need notch
[13:45] <Visiiri> I mean, I had ALL of the updates :|
[13:45] <Visiiri> and it ate my files
[13:45] <Flot> Instead of torches made with coal, you could make lanterns with blubber, etc.
[13:45] <LanternGhost> I like walruses.
[13:45] <LanternGhost> What about penguins?
[13:45] <Perry> MartyChang, how big it is?
[13:46] <Superwafflez> oil lanterns?
[13:46] <LanternGhost> Or Polar bears?
[13:46] <Perry> I mean, what's the size of the download?
[13:46] <Flot> Yes.
[13:46] <MartyChang> The layer of ice? I would think about 10 tiles down
[13:46] * Bacu (bacu.chan@adsl-065-080-182-193.sip.bna.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:46] <LanternGhost> I would make it 5 Marty
[13:46] <Ov3rkill> guysw
[13:46] <Superwafflez> yeah 5
[13:46] <LanternGhost> 10 seems like a bit to much
[13:46] <quaxar> If notch dosnt add cliffracers
[13:46] <quaxar> IDK
[13:46] <LanternGhost> but it depends on how hard it is I guess
[13:46] <quaxar> man
[13:46] <Pharod42> Penguins wouldvery fast swimmers but much weaker on the ground.
[13:46] <DeandreT> If the ice is too close to a heated are it will turn into water
[13:46] <MartyChang> if notch adds cliffracers I'm selling my minecraft account
[13:46] <LanternGhost> What would Penguins give you though?
[13:46] <quaxar> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O21E_Vj1JbI
[13:46] <DeandreT> Global warming lolz
[13:46] <quaxar> In infdev
[13:46] <quaxar> omg it would be awesome
[13:46] <Flot> Ooh, maybe this: Once you have a section of ice closed off from the open air (via a house) and enough lanterns are next to it, the ice thaws, and you can mine.
[13:47] <MartyChang> I don't think penguins should drop anything
[13:47] <Perry> I'm buying CS:S now :D
[13:47] <Pharod42> Flot, yes. Like that.
[13:47] <MartyChang> penguins are docile creatures IRL
[13:47] <MartyChang> since they have no natural predators
[13:47] <MartyChang> apart from sharks
[13:47] <quaxar> uh
[13:47] <DeandreT> They just annoy you
[13:47] <Pharod42> And orca?
[13:47] <quaxar> penguines get their shit eaten constantly
[13:47] <Flot> It would SUCK getting lost in a cave if you were under the artic biome.
[13:47] <Flot> Only one way up and all.
[13:47] <quaxar> Seals eat them
[13:47] <quaxar> orcas eat them
[13:48] <Pharod42> Melt another path, than.
[13:48] <LanternGhost> Although Flot that is a good idea with the ice melting it would be a bit hard to make
[13:48] <DeandreT> Arctic caves will be dangerous do to heat
[13:48] <DeandreT> they could flood
[13:48] <LanternGhost> I could see a tool you make though
[13:48] <LanternGhost> that melts and ice block
[13:48] <MartyChang> how about a jungle biome?
[13:48] <MartyChang> or a rainforest biome
[13:48] <MartyChang> with really large trees
[13:48] <Flot> Huh? I thought that we were talking about a layer of permafrost keeping you from mining: Once you melt that it's all regular rock, not ice.
[13:48] <Pharod42> we need beathing apparati.
[13:49] <LanternGhost> Such as a flamethrower(not sure what to call it) and you use it to melt the ice at faster speeds.
[13:49] <DeandreT> Monkeys-They fling poo and umm yeah thats pretty much it
[13:49] <Pharod42> Maybe youd need it near lava too.
[13:49] <LanternGhost> We kind of Flot.
[13:49] <LanternGhost> The ice would be mineable
[13:49] <LanternGhost> but it would take some time to remove
[13:49] <MartyChang> rainforests could have bananas
[13:49] <quaxar> Lets mine chaos emeralds
[13:49] <quaxar> and be knuckles
[13:49] <LanternGhost> Monkeys?
[13:49] <quaxar> and have a monkey destruction switch
[13:49] <LanternGhost> Monkeys throwing bananas?
[13:49] <quaxar> the best switch in the world
[13:49] <Flot> What Dean was talking about was if the entire cave was made of ice, as in lanterns melt the cave and make it flood.
[13:49] <lmaobot> Monkeys could be used cor delicious monkey meat
[13:49] <LanternGhost> Strange witch doctors?
[13:50] <DeandreT> Ice would be mine able indeed, but not recommended.

[13:50] <MartyChang> the banana would be a rainforest-specific resource, it heals for 4 health
[13:50] <LanternGhost> Well maybe the ice blocks would not make water
[13:50] <Pharod42> You could have cold light sorces like the aformention magic crystals.
[13:50] <LanternGhost> Lots of different herbs in a jungle
[13:50] <Pharod42> And a pump chain to remover newly melted water to the surface.
[13:50] <DeandreT> Specific areas need things they are specific for though. Blubber from walrus is best heat source
[13:50] <DeandreT> Jungle needs it big up
[13:51] <DeandreT> Pigs are a good source of food
[13:51] <Flot> That's a bit too complex Pharod.
[13:51] <LanternGhost> Jungle should be mainly used to gather rare herbs to be used for potions or cooking.
[13:51] <Pharod42> I'd still like some sort of pump.
[13:51] <LanternGhost> Also ruins in the jungles
[13:51] <Flot> I bet you would, perv.
[13:51] <Perry> lol
[13:51] <DeandreT> Arctic-Blubber (Best Heat Source)
[13:51] <LanternGhost> Ruins should be found a bit more often in the jungle.
[13:51] <Armonte> Hey guys; let's play some "Super Columbine Massacre RPG!" http://www.kobrasrealm.net/uploaded/ColumbineRPG.zip

[13:52] * PyroPyro (PyroPyro@79.101.236.236) has joined #minecraft
[13:52] <Flot> You know what'd be neat? As coal is not easy to get in artic biome, blubber would become its replacement, but when you leave the biome it starts to go rancid.
[13:52] <LanternGhost> Also the chance of finding ruins are increased
[13:52] <Armonte> lmaobot: nope
[13:52] <MartyChang> Underground-Various neat shit
[13:52] <LanternGhost> or they spawn more frequently in the jungle
[13:52] <DeandreT> Forest-Pigs (Best source of food)
[13:53] <Pharod42> And Ivory for valuable decoration, beacuse it'd be a sizable undertaking to gather it.
[13:53] <LanternGhost> Maybe Forest-Pigs
[13:53] <lmaobot> Deserts should have tombs with lots of undead
[13:53] <LanternGhost> I think it should have more mobs that resemble the forest
[13:53] <LanternGhost> and make it more harder to survive in
[13:53] <quaxar> its not that hard to get walrus tusks
[13:53] <LanternGhost> What about boars in the jungle?
[13:53] <quaxar> or find mastadon tusks pharod42
[13:53] <quaxar> Its harder to find gold dawg
[13:53] <MartyChang> Desert-Chitin (between iron and diamond in strength for armor)
[13:53] <LanternGhost> The boars would be fast moving and only be in the jungle
[13:53] <Pharod42> Desert and Icy should be the two 'hardest' biomes.
[13:53] <Pharod42> Imo.
[13:53] <Armonte> Biomes...
[13:54] <Armonte> Climate
[13:54] <lmaobot> Lemons
[13:54] <LanternGhost> Oh that would be good for you Forest-Pigs
[13:54] <LanternGhost> make the Forest-Boars
[13:54] <DeandreT> Paradise/Isles-Plants (good plants for recipes)
[13:54] <LanternGhost> they drop Boar meet and a tusk when killed
[13:54] <LanternGhost> or they can drop boar meat and a tusk when killed
[13:54] <Pharod42> And wolves, to keep the boars down.
[13:54] <DeandreT> Mobs that attack eachother
[13:54] <LanternGhost> the boar meat heals for the most when cooked and the tusks are used to craft something
[13:54] <Flot> This just came to mind: Why don't the hostile mobs attack friendly ones?
[13:54] <LanternGhost> Maybe a horn?
[13:54] <LanternGhost> Or something
[13:54] <Flot> Why do they only attack humans.
[13:55] <Pharod42> We killed all thier buddies?
[13:55] <DeandreT> I just said that Flot
[13:55] <DeandreT> :P
[13:55] <LanternGhost> It is not really needed to have them attack eachother
[13:55] <Flot> It's interesting, at least.
[13:55] <DeandreT> Creepers v Yeti
[13:55] <LanternGhost> Yea
[13:55] <LanternGhost> but not really needed
[13:55] <DeandreT> Skeletons v Boar
[13:55] <LanternGhost> Anyway I like the idea of a boar
[13:55] <Pharod42> Tribal Yeti v. Savage Yeti.
[13:55] <LanternGhost> the meat would heal for the most of any cooked meat
[13:55] <lmaobot> Marshes could have lots of clay or something
[13:56] <DeandreT> Walrus v Sharks and other fish
[13:56] <LanternGhost> but there would be other items you make that would heal more then the boar meat
[13:56] <MartyChang> clay could be used for pottery
[13:56] <MartyChang> pots could store food better

[13:56] <Pharod42> Oooh, Ohh! Nations, which'd send soldier npcs against one another.
[13:56] <LanternGhost> but I don't think food with ever age?
[13:56] <quaxar> how do we get to their tower of solitude on minecraft
[13:56] <LanternGhost> That's a bit to much Pharod
[13:56] <quaxar> its obvious we are on namek
[13:56] <quaxar> too bad the water is BLUE
[13:56] <DeandreT> But if you go near friendly mobs babies the parents turn agressive until 10 blocks away from the baby
[13:57] <lmaobot> Peat could be a fuel from marshes
[13:57] <LanternGhost> We will forum the nations ourself Pharod and war with eachother

[13:57] <LanternGhost> what would they be used for?
[13:57] <lmaobot> Notch will add those in a later expansion I think
[13:57] <DeandreT> Well, I like the idea of nations, but more likely player nations
[13:58] <LanternGhost> Players won't really form nations
[13:58] <LanternGhost> They will form towns though
[13:58] <Pharod42> He does mention a cart pushing engine of some kind.
[13:58] <LanternGhost> towns will be at war and I guess you could call them nations
[13:58] <LanternGhost> But we would not have anything as large to be called a nation
[13:58] <DeandreT> yeah
[13:59] <LanternGhost> So what would be in underwater biomes?
[13:59] <LanternGhost> Wait
[13:59] <LanternGhost> in the underwater biome
[13:59] <Pharod42> How about a stright line digger? You set it and fuel it and it digs a channel or horizonal narrow mine.
[13:59] <LanternGhost> Maybe Pharod
[13:59] <DeandreT> The largest group I would think to see would probably be a group of 60 players
[13:59] <DeandreT> at the most
[13:59] <LanternGhost> but that just removes the idea of having to do it yourself
[13:59] * Flot (Mibbit@adsl-67-60-226.mcn.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[13:59] <LanternGhost> also it would be easy to just dig it your self

[14:00] <LanternGhost> coral and things
[14:00] <LanternGhost> Fish in every zone used for cooking
[14:00] <lmaobot> Ocean biomes would have better fishing, shipwrecks, and sunken ruins

[14:00] <DeandreT> Does notch ever really get on iRC?
[14:00] <LanternGhost> sunken treasure :D
[14:01] <Flot> He's on it right now.
[14:01] <LanternGhost> Shipwrecks would be cool
[14:01] <LanternGhost> but not sure how they would be used
[14:01] <Flot> He's just idle.
[14:01] <LanternGhost> I would also love to see a cook device
[14:01] <LanternGhost> yea we can use a furance
[14:01] <LanternGhost> but I would love to see something more like a stove
[14:01] <DeandreT> A stove
[14:01] <LanternGhost> or an old aged oven
[14:01] <Flot> If cooking evolves enough he might make a stove, like he did with the furnace.
[14:01] <LanternGhost> You would use it to roast the fish and boar
[14:01] <LanternGhost> I would enjoy it
[14:02] <LanternGhost> I also want to see an alchemy set
[14:02] <LanternGhost> I would become our villages master cook and alchemist!
[14:02] <DeandreT> Cooking on wood makes the food heal 1+ extra heart while coal makes it heal one less heart
[14:02] <LanternGhost> Making boar by day and potions by night!

[14:03] <lmaobot> Cooking on propane and propane accessories adds +5 hearts
[14:03] <DeandreT> goes with herbs man
[14:03] <LanternGhost> things like apple trees.
[14:03] <LanternGhost> Yea DeandreT
[14:03] <LanternGhost> Alchemy and Cooking would go hand in hand.

[14:03] <LanternGhost> special herbs used for cooking could also be used for alchemy
[14:03] <Flot> I hate alchemy.
[14:03] <DeandreT> Some stuff can only be cooked in desert and jungle areas though
[14:03] <LanternGhost> I think it would be cool
[14:03] <DeandreT> Not cooked
[14:03] <LanternGhost> mixing some stuff together to make a healing potion
[14:03] <DeandreT> but planted
[14:03] <DeandreT> durr
[14:04] <LanternGhost> That would also be cool
[14:04] <Pharod42> Someone should be putting this stuff in Suggestions.
[14:04] <LanternGhost> Ok what other biomes?
[14:04] <lmaobot> I have a thread with lots of these biome idea I made a while ago
[14:04] <DeandreT> Like Cacti that holds water that heals 3 hearts can be planted in deserts
[14:04] <lmaobot> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=8470
[14:04] <LanternGhost> I like that idea also
[14:04] <Flot> Alchemy is just a fancy word. It's adding an unnecessary device to do something that a crafting table can do just as well.
[14:04] <DeandreT> Pineapple can be planted near or in jungle areas
[14:04] <LanternGhost> I guess you right Flot
[14:05] <LanternGhost> Maybe you don't need a alchemy device to make the items
[14:05] <DeandreT> No not an alchemy device
[14:05] <LanternGhost> but you could just use the crafting table to make the potions and alchemy things.
[14:05] <DeandreT> Crafting table works
[14:05] <Flot> The goal of Minecraft is to be varied, but you have to make sure that what you're adding varies the gameplay, not makes it complicated.
[14:05] <LanternGhost> Well I don't really think an alchemy device would be to complicated
[14:06] <LanternGhost> it would be like the alchemy sets you see in Oblivion
[14:06] <Flot> It splits in two what can be done in what, it complicates a process that could otherwise be done easier.
[14:06] <Perry> there's alchemy in oblivion?
[14:06] <LanternGhost> Not like the way they work
[14:06] <Flot> done in one*
[14:06] <LanternGhost> but the way the item looks.
[14:06] <LanternGhost> You are right
[14:06] <Perry> Yay! I'm at 85% of the download on steam of oblivion XD
[14:06] <LanternGhost> I would be fine either way though.
[14:06] <LanternGhost> Also yes

[14:07] <Flot> How long has C418 been idling here?
[14:07] <LanternGhost> You can gather different plant types from all over and mix them to make poisons / potions / things that increase your stats for a short period.
[14:07] <DeandreT> less helpful potions can be made in inventory, things like anti-dehydration potions. They are for in the desert if you have no water
[14:07] <Flot> I just noticed that.
[14:07] <Perry> 15 more percents until the awesome o.o
[14:07] <LanternGhost> He just got her Flot
[14:07] <Flot> Oooh.
[14:07] <LanternGhost> *here
[14:07] <LanternGhost> Well maybe like a few minutes ago
[14:07] <LanternGhost> but not to long.
[14:07] * copygirl throws a rock at copyboy
[14:07] <LanternGhost> Speaking of C418 I would love to have that music added to minecraft
[14:08] <LanternGhost> Would add a lot to the atmosphere of minecraft.
[14:08] <copyboy> D:
[14:08] <Flot> Lantern, this potion idea you have might warrant a separate booth to make potions, but only if there are enough of them, and they are useful enough that you'd see yourself making them often.
[14:08] <lmaobot> I'd like to see water have more practical uses to encourage things like aqueducts.
[14:08] <Perry> I also bought CS:S this morning because I just can't miss this: a game that sounds cool, and lots of the things I need in gmod :D
[14:08] <Flot> If there are only two potions and you hardly use them, they can be in a crafting booth.
[14:08] <Perry> new props and textures
[14:08] <Flot> CS:S is pretty bad Perry.
[14:08] <Perry> ...
[14:08] <Perry> And?
[14:08] <lmaobot> (Radio): Get out of there, it's gonna blow!
[14:09] <Flot> The community is awful, I'm sorry.
[14:09] <DeandreT> Thats an opinion
[14:09] <lmaobot> CSS has lots of serverside mods though
[14:09] <DeandreT> Opinion yet again
[14:09] <LanternGhost> Also I like the idea of the tombs in the desert
[14:09] <Shadaez> Perry you don't need to own css for the models in gmod
[14:09] <DeandreT> The mods of it make it fun
[14:09] <Perry> I know
[14:09] <Flot> I'm afraid that the community being awful is a fact, it's been proven by science.
[14:09] <LanternGhost> But it might be a bit to much for smp
[14:09] <Perry> I have some of the materials, but I still miss some
[14:09] <Shadaez> you can get everything
[14:09] <Shadaez> how much was it?
[14:09] <Perry> 6.80
[14:09] <Perry> on sale.
[14:09] * sppt (i@ip545125db.direct-adsl.nl) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[14:09] <Flot> The gameplay of CS:S is very base, and today it doesn't really stand out at all
[14:09] <Shadaez> well it's worth it then
[14:10] <copyboy> uh nice, the creator of minecraft is here
[14:10] <Perry> Aha. see?
[14:10] <Perry> lol
[14:10] <copyboy> and it's impossible for me to reach him
[14:10] <LanternGhost> Sort of copyboy
[14:10] <copyboy> dammit
[14:10] <LanternGhost> he is afk
[14:10] <LanternGhost> or sleeping
[14:10] <Shadaez> didn't know notch was in the channel
[14:10] <LanternGhost> or doing something that does not involve him in talking
[14:10] <Flot> He's idle.
[14:10] <DeandreT> Isnt he in Euorpe
[14:10] <LanternGhost> Well Flot

[14:10] <Flot> Yeah.
[14:10] <LanternGhost> maybe he is just being quite
[14:10] <Perry> Well, I didn't have all. I missed some textures and, well, my friend has a microwave prop and I don't D:
[14:10] <LanternGhost> and listing to our ideas
[14:10] <Shadaez> quiet*
[14:10] <LanternGhost> and watching us..
[14:10] <DeandreT> It should be day where he is
[14:10] <Flot> I doubt it.
[14:10] <lmaobot> Notch can't really respond often since the community is much larger than it used to be.
[14:10] <Perry> I saw an error and he told me it was from cs:s
[14:10] <Flot> But if he is, add a meat block.
[14:10] <LanternGhost> lol
[14:10] <copyboy> sure
[14:10] <Flot> 3x3 meat in crafting slot, makes a meat block.
[14:11] <Perry> 0.o
[14:11] <LanternGhost> why?
[14:11] <Flot> So I can make a house made of meat.
[14:11] <Flot> Why else?
[14:11] <LanternGhost> o.o
[14:11] <Shadaez> i wasn't aware css was on sale
[14:11] <Perry> ...
[14:11] <Perry> compression
[14:11] <Kawa> but it expires after a few days ingame
[14:11] <copyboy> i tried to show Notch my birthday present for him
[14:11] <Shadaez> also omg cod map pack
[14:11] <LanternGhost> What was it copyboy?
[14:11] <Perry> it's 66% off
[14:11] <Shadaez> just kidding lol
[14:11] <copyboy> LanternGhost: a bomberman gamemode
[14:11] <LanternGhost> lol
[14:11] <copyboy> dunno if he likes bomberman
[14:12] <Perry> only for today and tomorrow
[14:12] <copyboy> (it's running on a custom server ..)
[14:12] <LanternGhost> Anyway
[14:12] <Flot> Notch seems to like old-school games.
[14:12] <LanternGhost> What other biomes would we haev?
[14:12] <Flot> He likes Megaman, Mario, and Sonic from what I've seen.
[14:12] <LanternGhost> have?
[14:12] <LanternGhost> I think each biome should have some natural related disadvantage.
[14:12] <Speljohan__> ffffffff i hate my fucking sound card so badly :(
[14:12] <LanternGhost> Such as the ice one with the layer of ice making it hard to mine
[14:13] <copygirl> *catface*
[14:13] <LanternGhost> Water biome would be the whole breath thing
[14:13] <LanternGhost> Can't stay underwater for to long

[14:13] <LanternGhost> SpySpy?
[14:13] <Flot> In ice you can't mine, in jungle staying in heat over an extended amount of time does damage to you, in jungle trees saturate the land making it easy to get lost, in caves there are no trees (durr), etc.
[14:13] <Flot> In desert* for the second one
[14:13] <lmaobot> Ice wouldn't be a problem, it would be not being able to grow crops maybe
[14:13] * sllide (jari@ip565eb113.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft

[14:14] * C418 (C418@p5B3D4CEB.dip.t-dialin.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[14:14] <LanternGhost> You would see a few palm trees but they would yield less wood then a normal tree would give?
[14:14] <Flot> Maybe there could be cacti blocks.

[14:14] <LanternGhost> I want cacti inthe desert :D
[14:14] <Flot> Hello again C418!
[14:14] <LanternGhost> I want to have a running cacti monster.
[14:14] <Speljohan__> hey PyroPyro http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr5n4OBb6JA a masterpiece!!
[14:14] <lmaobot> Speculation has been pretty close before
[14:14] <Shadaez> lol when
[14:14] <LanternGhost> Also I would love to see some more improved combat items
[14:15] <Flot> I speculated that minecraft would be updated
[14:15] <LanternGhost> not sure if it will ever happen but I can hope
[14:15] <LanternGhost> such as more weapon varites
[14:15] <Flot> And behold, it has been! Many times!
[14:15] <LanternGhost> shields, spears, swords, axes.
[14:15] <copyboy> btw: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy5iT4aarKg < tf2 ftw
[14:15] <LanternGhost> It would be a game of rock paper scissors.
[14:15] <lmaobot> I made a thread about havinh large biomes over infdev maps before notch siad anything about them
[14:15] <Flot> Oh, and floating biome.
[14:16] <Flot> The special trait being you fall, you die of course
[14:16] <DeandreT> That would be found over all of them
[14:16] <DeandreT> but very high up
[14:16] <Nyutan> .. Updated since when, Flot? o.o
[14:16] <LanternGhost> Spears would be long range and good against different mob types
[14:16] <Nyutan> Did you give yourself a huuuuuuge window?
[14:16] <Flot> Who knows.
[14:16] <Flot> ;3
[14:16] <LanternGhost> Well axes/maces would be good against monsters with high armor. Such as golems if they are added
[14:16] <lmaobot> Maybe the magical infinite water sources could only be found on floating islands?
[14:16] * Nyutan yawns
[14:16] <Shadaez> god there's some awfully fishie smelling thing somewhere down here
[14:16] <Flot> I would like that.
[14:16] <LanternGhost> Since the smashing effect would be stronger compared to a stabbing.
[14:17] <Shadaez> inb4 childish coments
[14:17] <LanternGhost> But against a boar you would want to use a sword or spear
[14:17] <Nyutan> I'm trying to convine my parents to get me an android based phone when they get my brother one.
[14:17] <Flot> Alternative fighting weapons for different enemies. A club would work well against armoured enemies, and swords against bare ones
[14:17] <LanternGhost> Yar you got it Flot
[14:17] <LanternGhost> It would not be to hard to program also
[14:17] <LanternGhost> Or I would think it wouldn't

[14:18] <Flot> It wouldn't, really.
[14:18] * CyborgDragon is mooing the song of time
[14:18] <LanternGhost> It shouldn't be added right away though but I would love to see it later I guess.
[14:18] <DeandreT> Nyutan, if your brother is spoiled do everything you can not to get anything he gets and if he is like some brothers and brags about it, he will eventually give it up to you.
[14:18] <Flot> You are not a cow, stop mooing!
[14:18] <CyborgDragon> Mooooooooo.
[14:18] <Nyutan> What?
[14:19] <LanternGhost> I guess I would have to say on my list of what I would want notch to come out with first it would go like this
[14:19] <Nyutan> He's never bragged.. and he's not spoiled
[14:19] <LanternGhost> 1) BIomes 2)More enemies 3) Multiplayer survival.

[14:19] <Flot> Don't forget dye!
[14:19] <DeandreT> cool
[14:19] <LanternGhost> Meh
[14:19] <Flot> And hopefully practical uses for gold.
[14:19] <LanternGhost> I mean dye is cool
[14:19] <Flot> Or at least more decorative uses.
[14:19] <Nyutan> Thanks for your help though. o.o
[14:20] <LanternGhost> But those are my personal wishes on what I would want notch to release
[14:20] <LanternGhost> or in that order
[14:20] <LanternGhost> although it probably won't happen I can hope
[14:20] * ez (Mibbit@213.235.9.210) has joined #minecraft
[14:20] <LanternGhost> Also here is my guess on what he will release first
[14:20] * ChanServ sets mode +o ez
[14:20] <CyborgDragon> Hello ez.
[14:20] <ez> hello
[14:20] <lmaobot> We just need a blue flower for dye
[14:20] <LanternGhost> 1) Smpl 2) new enemy type 3) biomes.
[14:20] <Flot> ez, notch still hasn't added bubblegum fairies and wizards to infdev. What did you do? ;-;
[14:20] <CyborgDragon> lol flot
[14:21] <lmaobot> What we really need though
[14:21] <LanternGhost> That is my guess on what will be released
[14:21] <lmaobot> is lava zombies
[14:21] <LanternGhost> in that order
[14:21] <DeandreT> I got my sister to give up her phone and she got a new one that sucks. She would always brag about her phone, I never cared and she was like wtf why doesn't he care!!! I think my phone sucks now, I need a new one.
[14:21] <LanternGhost> Maybe before multiplayer survival he will add some other things like a boat.
[14:21] <LanternGhost> But he said on this blog "If that version works fine, I???ll replace indev with infdev and move on to working on something big."
[14:21] <lmaobot> I like boats, especially that laughter kind
[14:22] <LanternGhost> something big is probably multiplayer survival for the most part.
[14:22] <LanternGhost> Or it could be biomes.
[14:22] <DeandreT> Or not
[14:22] <CyborgDragon> or maybe infdev creative that he's talked about
[14:22] <Flot> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9t3FREAZ-k
[14:22] <LanternGhost> Wut?
[14:22] <Flot> Look at this cool game I found!
[14:22] <LanternGhost> Infdev creative?

[14:22] * Maart3h (Maart3h@86.92.114.65) has joined #minecraft
[14:22] <LanternGhost> what is infdev creative?
[14:23] <lmaobot> I remember when minecraft had 4 blocks, and no water or skybox
[14:23] <CyborgDragon> creative mode, but with infdev stuffs
[14:23] <ez> infinite creative I guess
[14:23] <LanternGhost> Isn't that smp?
[14:23] <CyborgDragon> not really
[14:23] <Flot> Will there be an infinite creative mode? That sounds kind of useless.
[14:23] <CyborgDragon> it's not survival
[14:23] <CyborgDragon> you're not surviving

[14:23] * CyborgDragon points at notch's twitter
[14:23] <CyborgDragon> he's said it twice now
[14:23] <Flot> Unless it's like a ticker option Small<Medium<Large<Infinite
[14:23] <Perry> like, update the current creative with infdev physics
[14:23] <LanternGhost> but you will have items like a pickaxe and furnace and such
[14:24] <DeandreT> Infiniminer was fun while it lasted, but then Minecraft came along.

[14:24] <Flot> Probably notching around.
[14:24] <lmaobot> There was a feeling that infiniminer managed to capture that minecraft hasn't yet though
[14:24] <ez> doing notching
[14:24] <DeandreT> Probably being epic
[14:24] <LanternGhost> Har Har Har
[14:24] <DeandreT> like always
[14:24] <LanternGhost> He is in the IRC but seems to be away
[14:24] <Shadaez> I wish everyone in here would stop being so infatuated with notch, except ez
[14:24] <Perry> LanternGhost: no items, you can add every block you want and remove them
[14:25] <LanternGhost> or maybe he is just watching us and reading what we have to say.
[14:25] <ez> lol Shadaez
[14:25] <Perry> lol
[14:25] <LanternGhost> I thought we came up with some good ideas so maybe he saw some of them.
[14:25] <DeandreT> Notch is a spah
[14:25] <Perry> maybe
[14:25] <LanternGhost> Anyway I need to go to sleep, it is 3:24 am here
[14:25] <LanternGhost> but the nice thing is Notch updates the game when I sleep
[14:25] <CyborgDragon> im not that infatuated, xD, i discuss a little, but not that much, and i dont get overly excited when he joins
[14:25] <Flot> You mean 3:25.

[14:30] <Flot> Is it possible to use vertex offsets in only certain blocks?

[14:42] <CyborgDragon> i have headphones that cant be adjusted

[14:43] <bildramer> and my speaker volume isn't even 100%
[14:43] <Visiiri> I'm always at 4%

[14:47] <bildramer> and I'll throw away all the dirt anyway
[14:47] <bildramer> and yeah
[14:47] <bildramer> infdev needs more iron and less dirt

[14:48] <bildramer> and coal is alright
[14:48] <bildramer> wat
[14:48] <Perry> because else, it makes the game really hard to start up
[14:48] <ZomBuster> lol Perry I am drowning in coal
[14:48] <bildramer> iron is very rare, really
[14:48] <bildramer> and what ZomBuster said
[14:48] <CyborgDragon> im drowning in iron myself
[14:48] <Perry> I know, when the game is started up
[14:48] <CyborgDragon> i've gotten over 1200 pieces of iron in this cave complex
[14:48] <bildramer> I get like over 256 coal per mining session
[14:48] <Perry> because in my former main save I was drowning in coal
[14:48] <bildramer> almost as much coal as stone
[14:48] <CyborgDragon> how do you think i got so many tracks?
[14:48] <CyborgDragon> also, zom http://tinyurl.com/34aob9n
[14:48] <bildramer> CyborgDragon, me wants
[14:49] <CyborgDragon> :D
[14:49] <CyborgDragon> tracks only
[14:49] <ZomBuster> holy shit
[14:49] <bildramer> lol
[14:49] <ZomBuster> is that 1 continues track?
[14:49] <CyborgDragon> yeah
[14:49] <CyborgDragon> all the breaks are either 4-ways or t-bone junctions
[14:49] <Perry> just how many track pieces did you place?
[14:49] <CyborgDragon> i have no idea
[14:49] <bildramer> count them
[14:49] <bildramer> lol
[14:49] <CyborgDragon> think you could add a count function to cartograph, zom?
[14:49] <CyborgDragon> xD
[14:49] <Perry> wait... in that weird freckled square... thewy're all junctions?
[14:49] <Perry> O.O?!
[14:50] <CyborgDragon> yeah
[14:50] <ZomBuster> I did lol
[14:50] * CyborgDragon never noticed
[14:50] <ZomBuster> but when I added the GUI i couldnt display it easily
[14:50] <CyborgDragon> ah
[14:50] <ZomBuster> ill output it to a txt file
[14:51] <CyborgDragon> also bildramer, my secret to finding iron is
[14:51] <CyborgDragon> gravel-filled caves
[14:51] <bildramer> hm
[14:51] <bildramer> ZomBuster, you can load files so easily
[14:51] <bildramer> amirite
[14:51] <bildramer> add a "convert all stone to air" button

[14:57] <CyborgDragon> had the wom client open

[14:57] <Lmaoboat> I use Mibbit. HATERS GONNA HATE

[14:59] <CyborgDragon> Telnet up in this bitch.

[14:59] <CyborgDragon> xD
[14:59] <Visiiri> I'm purple therefore I win
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> I actually tried that after someone said it
[14:59] <Perry> and themes
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> perry
[14:59] <Iriscorven> Oh snap. Someone said Telnet.
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> chatzilla, auto any command
[14:59] <Perry> yes?
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> xD
[14:59] <Perry> lol
[14:59] <Perry> I have cz too
[14:59] <Iriscorven> u hardcore, broseph.
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> no srsly, a while ago someone said you could connect to irc via telnet
[14:59] <Perry> but I always use mirc
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> so i tried it
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> was funny
[14:59] <Visiiri> Except Chatzilla requires FireFox
[14:59] <CyborgDragon> xD
[15:00] <Visiiri> and there's NO reason ANYONE should have firefox

[15:00] * sppt (i@ip545125db.direct-adsl.nl) has joined #minecraft
[15:00] <CyborgDragon> and why not vis?
[15:00] <Perry> I was tired of IE
[15:00] <Perry> lolwhat vis
[15:00] <Iriscorven> That implies you didn't succeed! I AM DISAPPOINTED.
[15:00] <Visiiri> FF sucks.
[15:00] <CyborgDragon> i did succeed iris
[15:00] <Visiiri> Slow loading, bad layout, overly done
[15:00] <CyborgDragon> but i found it boring after a while
[15:00] <Iriscorven> Visiiri; This is certainly true, as of late.
[15:00] <CyborgDragon> slow loading?
[15:00] <Visiiri> Sure, it's got addons
[15:00] <CyborgDragon> lol
[15:00] <Perry> Only the theme I have in firefox was a sufficient reason to leave IE.
[15:00] <Visiiri> But Chrome will ALWAYS beat it
[15:00] <Visiiri> ALWAYS
[15:00] <Perry> Now, though, FF sucks balls because of an update.
[15:00] <CyborgDragon> no.
[15:00] <CyborgDragon> It won't visiiri.
[15:01] <Visiiri> Chrome is like 10x as fast
[15:01] <Visiiri> simple
[15:01] <Perry> crappy update that makes it crash
[15:01] <Iriscorven> I went from it running quick. To running slower. To Livestreams being slow. To Chatango not loading. To Livestream not loading.
[15:01] <Visiiri> doesn't require much ram
[15:01] * CyborgDragon did a comparison of the mem usage between chrome and firefox
[15:01] <Iriscorven> In only 3 updates.
[15:01] <CyborgDragon> chrome uses more memory
[15:01] <CyborgDragon> because of how it opens tabs
[15:01] <Visiiri> And it's still faster.
[15:01] <CyborgDragon> with each new tab, it literally starts a new exe
[15:01] <Visiiri> err, no
[15:01] <CyborgDragon> it does.
[15:01] <CyborgDragon> Try it sometime.
[15:01] <Visiiri> :| Err, no
[15:01] <Visiiri> It doesn't even start a new process
[15:01] <CyborgDragon> it does.
[15:01] <sppt> err no aint an argument
[15:02] <Flot> It does.
[15:02] <CyborgDragon> also, i hate the look of chrome, it's ugly
[15:02] <Flot> I know.
[15:02] <Visiiri> sppt: err, yes, it is
[15:02] <Flot> I've been using it for awhile.
[15:02] <Visiiri> CyborgDragon: Try a theme
[15:02] <Flot> It's still faster than firefox.
[15:02] <CyborgDragon> flot, i dont care if it's faster
[15:02] <Budda> firefox is plenty fast
[15:02] <CyborgDragon> i care bout memory
[15:02] <sppt> isnt opera faster than firefox as well?
[15:02] <Flot> You're silly.
[15:02] <CyborgDragon> and safety
[15:02] <Budda> i dont need the extra ms
[15:02] <Flot> I have 6GB of RAM.
[15:02] <CyborgDragon> i have my firefox decked out with safety features
[15:02] <Visiiri> :| Like what
[15:02] <CyborgDragon> noscript, requestpolicy, etc etc
[15:02] <Flot> I got memory to SPARE, buddy.
[15:03] <Visiiri> lol
[15:03] <Visiiri> Are you afraid of visiting a terrible site?
[15:03] <CyborgDragon> no
[15:03] <Visiiri> Then what's the point :|
[15:03] <CyborgDragon> i dont like ppl gathering infoz on me

[15:04] <Visiiri> You've gone incognito.

[15:04] <Visiiri> CyborgDragon: Ah, whatever
[15:04] <Visiiri> For the paranoid fuck, I guess FF could be better
[15:04] <Iriscorven> But, this POS also runs Minecraft better than some Quad-cores.
[15:05] <CyborgDragon> I guess i'm a paranoid fuck then.
[15:05] <CyborgDragon> xD
[15:05] <Flot> Nah.
[15:05] <Visiiri> yup :D
[15:05] <Iriscorven> I hear about all these framerate issues; They're non-existant for me. I always have a stable 34fps.
[15:05] <Flot> 34?
[15:05] <Visiiri> I usually get 200 FPS in infdev
[15:05] <Flot> I've had above 80 at all times.
[15:05] <Visiiri> and 800 in creative
[15:05] <Perry> here too
[15:05] <Iriscorven> It never drops under 30, even during day-night cycles. It's quite smooth.
[15:05] <CyborgDragon> i get 300-400 in creative
[15:05] <Perry> About same as visiiri
[15:05] <Flot> Unless I start a foewest fiyah or something
[15:05] <Roze> Hello Visiiri and Perry
[15:05] <CyborgDragon> i get 16-24 in infdev
[15:05] <Perry> hi :D
[15:05] <Roze> You lucky bastard, Visiiri
[15:05] <Flot> Woah what
[15:05] <CyborgDragon> with lagspikes whenever a new chunk is created
[15:06] <Visiiri> teehee
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> or loaded
[15:06] <Roze> I get around the same for Creative.
[15:06] <Iriscorven> Only time it ever dipped below 30 for me was back before lighting got fixed in Indev. Then I had like... 15-20.
[15:06] <Roze> BUt like 30 for Surv
[15:06] <Visiiri> I drop to 24 fps at sunrise/sunset because it reloads chunks
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> ogawdthelighting
[15:06] * Nyutan strip mines a huge 15x12xHUGEHOLE.
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> i get 0fps during day/night changes in indev
[15:06] <Nyutan> Sparta pit for Nyu.
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> xD
[15:06] <Sparky20> tHAT IS HUGE?
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> unless im in my house
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> and have it sealed up
[15:06] <Sparky20> oops
[15:06] <Perry> hmm? I don't remember my fps going down at dawn or dusl
[15:06] <Perry> dusk
[15:06] <Wampbit> I'm playing indev with 450 stable fps
[15:06] <CyborgDragon> then i get 3-4 fps
[15:06] <Sparky20> capslock
[15:06] <Nyutan> The huge part is depth
[15:06] <Sparky20> That is huge?
[15:07] <Nyutan> I dunnno how deep
[15:07] <Nyutan> :D
[15:07] <Flot> Yes, pretty big.
[15:07] <CyborgDragon> back to my infdev and crazy minetracks :D
[15:07] <sppt> crazy is right
[15:07] <Perry> Nyutan: Good luck, the one I made was 12x12
[15:07] <Visiiri> Infdev is epic
[15:07] <Visiiri> because of ONE map I have
[15:07] <CyborgDragon> btw if anyone wants to play around with my world, http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?z3jymndqmzo
[15:07] <Nyutan> I can do it
[15:07] <Visiiri> it's a mountain
[15:07] <Nyutan> :)
[15:07] <Visiiri> with a vertical cave in the middle
[15:07] <Perry> Nyutan: it took about a (rl) day to finish
[15:07] <sppt> bwahaha
[15:07] <CyborgDragon> have fun with my crazy tracks and finding my secret chests
[15:07] <Visiiri> that goes almost all the way down the the lava
[15:07] <Visiiri> :D
[15:07] <sppt> my creative mode fps peaks at 1150 fps
[15:07] <ZomBuster> vertical caves are awesome
[15:07] <ZomBuster> first one I found had diamond at the bottom
[15:08] <Visiiri> sppt: On small maps looking over the water I get that too xD
[15:08] <Nyutan> I have time to waste at the moment
[15:08] <CyborgDragon> it still upsets me that water springs replace still water
[15:08] * Timec (anon268413@host81-129-15-157.range81-129.btcentralplus.com) has joined #minecraft
[15:08] <sppt> generally it's around 700-800
[15:08] <Perry> did anyone ever see that bug in MP that the wom client log refers as "stack overload"?
[15:08] <Timec> Morning
[15:08] <Timec> Oh cool, Notch is on.
[15:08] <Timec> Hey perry.
[15:08] <CyborgDragon> afk
[15:08] <ZomBuster> CyborgDragon how so?
[15:08] <sppt> which is a waste of fucking power
[15:08] <CyborgDragon> idling
[15:08] <sppt> but hey :D
[15:08] <Perry> it happened once in a server in wich someone dug a huge hole under the spawn
[15:08] <Sparky20> Oh god.
[15:08] <Visiiri> no h4x heer
[15:08] <CyborgDragon> zom, ever checked the block ids of water springs?
[15:08] <Sparky20> what have you done?
[15:08] * ylt (youliketha@92.10.163.68) has joined #minecraft
[15:08] <Perry> that made that when you logged it, you appeared in some place that looked like nothing
[15:08] <CyborgDragon> they share the id with still water in creative/indev
[15:08] <Iriscorven> I think the reason I'm so addicted to Minecraft is because this old PC can't run anything newer than Bioshock, and that's on the lowest settings, at 640x480.
[15:09] <Perry> with a fps of 80 000+
[15:09] <CyborgDragon> basically notch replaced still water with water springs
[15:09] <Perry> but you couldn't do anything
[15:09] <Visiiri> I had a computer that was built in 2002
[15:09] <Timec> Iriscorven: Thats not THAT old...
[15:09] <Visiiri> I'd have full fog looking straight down and be lucky to have 12 FPS
[15:09] <Visiiri> xD
[15:09] <Iriscorven> Timec; It was "top of the line" when HL2 came out. lol
[15:09] <ZomBuster> you worried about creative maps with floating water?
[15:09] <Timec> lol I bet :)
[15:10] <Marach> ohi
[15:10] <Perry> hi Timec
[15:10] <Iriscorven> Even has a 128mb Geforce 6800. Beast of a card, for it's time.
[15:10] <Flot> Wow!
[15:10] <Visiiri> yaknow what would be cool
[15:10] <Iriscorven> Unlock those extra pipelines, and vertex shaders.
[15:10] <Timec> My PC isn't THAT good either, I can play Crysis on High and MW2 on Full :(
[15:10] * Marach twitches
[15:10] <Flot> I bet you could run CSS at near max specs with that thing!
[15:10] <bildramer> :l
[15:10] <CyborgDragon> no zom, i just wished he left still water in
[15:10] <Flot> Golly gosh.
[15:10] <Ominus> my comp is pre2k!
[15:10] <Budda> [23:09:05] <Perry> with a fps of 80 000+
[15:10] <Budda> wat
[15:10] <Iriscorven> Hell yeah, Flot.
[15:10] <Perry> Yeah, a bug did that
[15:10] <Iriscorven> I can even run Quake 3 at 60fps.
[15:10] <bildramer> lol
[15:10] <Flot> I have a 260GTX now.
[15:10] <Marach> :/
[15:10] <Perry> the game froze and the fps counter showed a very weird number
[15:10] <Budda> when i was playing around with opengl, i made a blank screen and only got 10k fps max
[15:10] <Marach> i have a radeon x600
[15:10] <Perry> I think I have a pic somewhere
[15:11] <Ominus> and i can run ARMA 2 on max grafix!
[15:11] <Timec> flot isn't it GTX260 now?
[15:11] <Visiiri> I can run JC2 on max
[15:11] * bildramer plays some earth editor
[15:11] <Timec> I mean they swapped it around.
[15:11] <Visiiri> :D
[15:11] <Ominus> if i watch it in a video on youtube
[15:11] <Visiiri> And I can run ME2 on max
[15:11] <Timec> JC2?
[15:11] <Visiiri> :D
[15:11] <Visiiri> Just Cause 2
[15:11] <Flot> I can play Just Cause 2 well too. Not max.
[15:11] <Visiiri> AMAZING GRAPHICS
[15:11] <Flot> Dat water man, dat water.
[15:11] <Visiiri> Yeah
[15:11] <Timec> Oh yeah love that game. LOST!
[15:11] <Iriscorven> It's all cool, though. I'm getting a deal on a complete upgrade. 2.8ghz Athlon II x2, 2gb's DDR2-800, and a 1gb Geforce 9800 for $280.
[15:11] <Visiiri> I have to turn off detailed water
[15:11] <Visiiri> :(
[15:11] <Flot> Other than that, run it well.
[15:11] <Marach> i can run Portal on minimum settings! :D
[15:11] <Marach> and hl2!
[15:11] <Ominus> :D
[15:12] <Visiiri> I have problems with water in ANY game
[15:12] <Marach> infdev doesn't work though.
[15:12] <Visiiri> Like, oblivion, even
[15:12] <Timec> Thats odd, water is generally the most up to date GFX in any new game.
[15:13] <Flot> What do you mean by that.
[15:13] <Perry> what a shame! I deleted the pic T_T
[15:13] <Visiiri> That one of your mom?
[15:14] <Timec> In most games the GFX are great but the water generally is the bit that actually looks the most like trailers/art work. (realism)
[15:14] <Roze> JC2 was pure win
[15:14] <Visiiri> Yeah
[15:14] <Visiiri> until the final battle
[15:14] <Perry> no I have it!
[15:14] <Flot> Water is usually the most graphically demanding thing in a game: refraction, reflection, and sometimes real-time water physics all account for this.
[15:14] <Perry> :D
[15:14] <Visiiri> that was bullshit
[15:14] <Visiiri> :|
[15:14] <Visiiri> It doesn't matter if you're a fatass president
[15:14] <Timec> Flot, hint the realism...
[15:14] <Roze> I've just done the 3 Kings
[15:14] <Visiiri> it doesn't take 40 fucking misiles to kill you
[15:14] <Roze> Dont spoil.
[15:14] <Visiiri> K, well, he's HARD to beat
[15:14] <Roze> Argh.
[15:14] <Visiiri> and that, in every game, is bullshit
[15:14] <Visiiri> one shot to the head kills EVERYONE
[15:14] <Flot> There's hardly anything to spoil in Just Cause 2, it has no story.
[15:14] <Visiiri> NO MATTER WHAT
[15:14] <ZomBuster> I agree Visiiri
[15:14] <Roze> :D
[15:15] <Perry> Budda I'm going to show you :D
[15:15] <Flot> There is only one major plot event in JC2.
[15:15] <Roze> JC2 had a story.
[15:15] <Flot> And it happens halfway in the game.
[15:15] <ZomBuster> they atleast could have give him some super robot armor or something
[15:15] <Visiiri> A minimal one
[15:15] <Timec> Flot: But the GFX! :P
[15:15] <Flot> Oh yooou.
[15:15] <Roze> Graphics, and Engine were excellent.
[15:15] <Timec> Who neeeds a JC2 story with P0rtal 2 coming out :):):)
[15:15] <Flot> You mean in 2011.
[15:15] <Timec> Well yes.
[15:15] <Flot> 3:
[15:15] <Roze> Any Halo haters?
[15:16] <Flot> I feel like I just made that smiley face sad. ;-;
[15:16] <Visiiri> portal 2 = valve
[15:16] <Visiiri> 2011 = 2020
[15:16] <Roze> Because sucks to be them, if they like JC2.
[15:16] <Adam01> heh
[15:16] <Timec> Roze I don't hate it, but I don't play combat games.
[15:16] <Roze> It runs on the same engine.
[15:16] <Roze> Fair enough Timec
[15:16] <zeroZshadow> hey notch :)
[15:16] <Timec> Hes idling zeroZshadow
[15:16] <Visiiri> I play Combat Arms
[15:16] <Visiiri> cuz i'm a noob like that
[15:16] <Visiiri> :D
[15:16] <zeroZshadow> damn, had something fun to show him
[15:16] <Lmaoboat> That doesn't make any sense
[15:16] <Roze> I still aint played CA.
[15:16] <Timec> Sims 3 all the way man!
[15:16] <Roze> I need to finish Mass Effect 2.
[15:17] <Roze> Timec, is now a legend!
[15:17] <Timec> Whoot!
[15:17] <Visiiri> I HATE sims 3
[15:17] <Lmaoboat> If I hated CSS, should I hate Half Life 2?
[15:17] * Timec walks slowly out of the room...
[15:17] <Roze> I use cheats for building though.
[15:17] <zeroZshadow> you guys are playing something OTHER then minecraft ?
[15:17] <Visiiri> it's like they actually took away content from the sims 2
[15:17] <Visiiri> to add some customization :|
[15:17] <Roze> Vis, you make a broad point there.
[15:17] * Sparky20 is away: Busy
[15:17] <Roze> But they did the same from 1 to 2.
[15:17] <Nyutan> going to take nap. Keep pushing tiny cart.
[15:17] <Visiiri> Roze: There's not diving board in the Sims 3
[15:17] <Visiiri> therefore, I am right.
[15:17] * CyborgDragon loves koko's mob trap
[15:18] <Roze> Ahm,
[15:18] <Wampbit> I liked Sims 3 a lot more than #2 - although I thought the game was dead after a few sims
[15:18] <Timec> Visiiri: And better GFX and faster engine, and the neibourhood and the chance for proper expansions.
[15:18] <Perry> http://i47.tinypic.com/2b653k.jpg Budda, watch this :D
[15:18] <Roze> But there is more directly skills
[15:18] <Visiiri> dem fucking cars
[15:18] <Visiiri> driving at 9999999999 mph
[15:18] <Timec> I love the new skills...make the game.
[15:18] <Budda> ....wat
[15:18] <Roze> Like how you can learn how to paint and learn how to play guitar.
[15:18] <Perry> That link leads to the pic of the most epic server fail ever
[15:18] <Timec> Visiiri: You could get a mod.
[15:18] <Budda> 890k fps
[15:18] <Roze> Not both at the same time...
[15:18] <Budda> ...
[15:18] <Visiiri> Timec: or they could make the game right
[15:18] <Roze> Vis, wins that debate.
[15:18] <Timec> Lol yah, im not in disagreement.
[15:18] <Wampbit> O.O
[15:18] <Perry> but half of the pic was cut off for some reason
[15:19] <Perry> D:
[15:19] <Timec> Still sims 3 has its flaws (like any game) but for those who like that genre (like me) its a pretty big step up, especially the latest expansion...
[15:19] <Perry> when that bug happened, I lol'd. Then I realized the server was broken. I had a sad.
[15:19] * CyborgDragon just sheared sheep by hitting them with a orch
[15:19] <Roze> TS3 is still awesome,
[15:19] <CyborgDragon> torch*

[15:19] <Adam01> TS3?
[15:19] <Timec> Roze: +1
[15:19] <Perry> lol CyborgDragon, Hit them with an Orc
[15:19] <Timec> The Sims 3
[15:19] <Roze> Not teamspeak.
[15:19] <Adam01> ah
[15:19] <Adam01> Timesplitters 3 was awesome...
[15:20] <Timec> lol
[15:20] <Roze> Don't remember playing that.
[15:20] <Timec> I heard that failed, compared to no# 2.
[15:20] <ZomBuster> CyborgDragon here http://filesmelt.com/dl/Cartxt.zip
[15:20] <Roze> It reminds me of TimeCrisis
[15:20] * ez is planning cart and rail systems for mining
[15:20] <ZomBuster> output txt file with most block values
[15:20] <Perry> In the pic, I seem to be at the bottom of the map, hence the lava, encased in stone.
[15:20] <Roze> Ez, try make a roller coaster.
[15:20] <Roze> A oneway idiotic one.
[15:20] <ez> did a bit
[15:20] <ez> lol
[15:20] <CyborgDragon> ez, did you see my crazy rail system?
[15:20] <ZomBuster> I got one going trough a lavafall
[15:20] <Roze> From the upmost summit of the map?
[15:20] <Timec> Has Notch said anything since he came on by the way?
[15:20] <ez> no CyborgDragon
[15:21] <Roze> Yeh, i did the same thing zom!
[15:21] <Lmaoboat> Anaconda FTW http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJzS9va0ciM
[15:21] <Wampbit> How do you keep track of your mines? I just get lost in them...
[15:21] <Timec> I kindof slept in late today :S (went to bed at 3am mind -.-)
[15:21] <Flot> ez, make a spiral downwards and play ominous yet slightly bouncy villain music as you ride down.

[15:22] <Timec> So like....has Notch said anything since he came online?
[15:22] <Wampbit> Thanks - I'll try that
[15:22] <Roze> Very smart ideas Adam.
[15:22] <Perry> it happened a huge while ago
[15:22] <CyborgDragon> he talked a little
[15:22] <CyborgDragon> he's been quiet since
[15:22] <Perry> when someone dug a nig hole beneath the spawn
[15:22] <Roze> I tend to use sand or cloth
[15:22] <Timec> Oh cool...what he say

[15:22] <zeroZshadow> Adam01, looks handy
[15:23] <zeroZshadow> but that won't work for larger caves :P
[15:23] <Timec> Is he going to merge indev today? Ridable carts? Some way of getting up hill with carts?
[15:23] <zeroZshadow> pushing them :P
[15:23] <ez> we must push little cart!
[15:23] <Timec> Awww no, that makes it boring coming back up out of the cave!
[15:23] <zeroZshadow> xD
[15:23] <Timec> Might aswell just pick it up, then walk back up.
[15:23] <Flot> ez is a heavy, oh no!
[15:23] <zeroZshadow> ez, should have seen that coming
[15:23] <ez> =)

[15:24] <ez> I like payload maps the best
[15:24] <Flot> This new save system ended up being horribly complex, hah. I basically rolled my own file system. But it's fast! about a minute ago
[15:24] <Roze> I can never find a good spot.
[15:24] <Roze> So i find a nice lake
[15:24] <Flot> New twitter, so yay.
[15:24] <Roze> or basin.
[15:24] <Armonte> <@ez> we must push little cart!
[15:24] <Armonte> THIS
[15:25] <Lmaoboat> I like 2fort, because I can stand outside the battlements spawn and wait until I hear someone spawn. If I time it just right, they get tauntkilled the instant the door cracks open

[15:26] <Roze> I feels like noob.
[15:26] <Ether> You have to push the cart to the enemy's base

[15:26] <Ether> Then it goes boom
[15:26] <Trapiki> Hai gaise
[15:26] <Roze> Sounds nice.

[15:26] <Ether> It's fun
[15:26] <CyborgDragon> could it possibly not be creating the txt file?

[15:36] <CyborgDragon> im trying to go up perry, but the water is grabbing me and pulling me down
[15:36] <Perry> but you can climb a stream of water without a ladder
[15:36] <Perry> o.O?
[15:36] <CyborgDragon> despite holding jump
[15:36] <Trapiki> OpalMist: Plus my Minecraft Amusement park

[15:41] <IrisCorven> Same. I frequent a video game stream, and made a small town to accommodate us as we get things together to build a city. Just a little walled in village, with a Mount Olympus-style shrine atop a mountain.
[15:41] <Perry> lool
[15:41] <IrisCorven> So when MP becomes reality, I most definitely want to port that.

[15:41] <CyborgDragon> how the hell did that torch get under my ocean?
[15:41] <Roze> Very nice CyborgDragon
[15:41] <Trapiki> perhaps it's something from an old save?

[15:41] <CyborgDragon> and saw that
[15:42] <CyborgDragon> so i swam over

[16:12] <Timec> Notch: Hello.......
[16:12] <Wampbit> Is there a max height? If so I seem to have hit it..
[16:12] <ZaxKellens> I've been there too, but they wouldn't let me tour the facility T.T

[16:12] <Visiiri> srsly
[16:12] <CyborgDragon> it only takes 5 minecraftians to carry around the titanic
[16:12] <OpalMist> bildramer: and rails are already implimented
[16:12] <bildramer> lol
[16:13] <bildramer> rails and halfblocks?

[16:14] <bildramer> did Notch say that?
[16:14] <Marach> it's Let's See If Beyond Good & Evil Finally Magically Begins To Work time!
[16:14] <OpalMist> CyborgDragon: As in, that's what 24 carat gold would weigh in a 1x1x1 meter block?
[16:14] <Lmaoboat> Half blocks should just act like normal blocks on the z axis and be let light and water through on the x and y
[16:14] <Timec> Yes on twitter.
[16:14] <ZaxKellens> Yes bildramer
[16:14] <CyborgDragon> lets assume you have a minecraftian carrying a full inventory of gold blocks
[16:14] <bildramer> sure
[16:15] <ZaxKellens> Today is the update

[16:15] <OpalMist> CyborgDragon: LOL
[16:15] <Timec> Valve = Epix
[16:15] <Visiiri> Getting games to work on Macs at the same time

[16:15] <Roze> While we stay normal.

[16:17] <Speljohan__> u
[16:17] * Roze slaps Marach with Ozzy Osbourne
[16:17] <CyborgDragon> considering that the minecraftian world has approximately double earth's gravity
[16:17] <Lmaoboat> doesn't that depend on what you're carrying?
[16:17] <Marach> yay, it's working now
[16:17] <CyborgDragon> we double that weight
[16:17] <Trapiki> ZaxKellens: With a lot of feather.
[16:17] <Visiiri> i am typing with my face.

[16:18] <Marach> bildramer: don't click

[16:18] <bildramer> Lmaoboat, not existing
[16:18] <vurtual> BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ out of nowhere
[16:18] <Lmaoboat> Find a place where they start talking about their fanfictions
[16:18] <Marach> "The graphics card drivers are not up-to-date"
[16:19] <CyborgDragon> so minecraftitans(as i am now calling them) can carry 89,129,600 kilograms or 196,497,132 pounds
[16:19] <Superwafflez> lol fanfic
[16:19] <Superwafflez> lol what drivers you on marach?
[16:19] <CyborgDragon> i factored in the approximately double gravity on the minecraftian world
[16:19] <Marach> newest
[16:19] <Marach> radeon x600...
[16:19] <bildramer> lol
[16:19] <CyborgDragon> that's how much weight a minecraftitan can carry
[16:19] <Superwafflez> ahah undetected and unsupported
[16:19] <Superwafflez> sucks
[16:19] <Marach> :/
[16:19] <Trapiki> and the high diamond content
[16:19] <ZaxKellens> CyborgDragon : Bag of Holding, Hammerspace
[16:19] <Marach> i hate ati
[16:19] <CyborgDragon> No.
[16:19] <ZaxKellens> The bag weighs NOTHING
[16:19] <CyborgDragon> No bag of holding.
[16:19] <Marach> but i have more important stuff to buy...
[16:19] <Lmaoboat> I saw some guy talking about his self-insert Sonic the Hedgehog fan-fic, and got out of there faster than Colonel Sanders at a PETA convention
[16:19] <Sparky20> what material did you use for that figure?
[16:20] <Superwafflez> Yeah ATI always had bad drivers in the sheme of things
[16:20] <ZaxKellens> BAG OF HOLDING
[16:20] <Marach> like a gamecube controller and memory card
[16:20] <Zaneo> ati driver > nvidia drivers
[16:20] <CyborgDragon> zax
[16:20] <Sparky20> 1m*1m of what?
[16:20] <ZaxKellens> Cyborg
[16:20] <CyborgDragon> until notch says they use a bag of holding
[16:20] <CyborgDragon> im saying they dont
[16:20] <Timec> Zaneo: True. But...
[16:20] <Timec> Nvidia > ATI
[16:20] <ZaxKellens> How else could you carry all that shit?
[16:20] <Marach> ^
[16:20] <Zaneo> yeah
[16:20] <Superwafflez> minecraftiant stack blocks on their head
[16:20] <ZaxKellens> It's a bag of holding
[16:20] <OpalMist> Fourty four MILLION, five thousand and sixty-four, eighthundred kilograms. 44,564.8 metric tons.
[16:20] <CyborgDragon> theyre minecraftitans
[16:20] <CyborgDragon> TITANS
[16:20] <Zaneo> but nvidia drivers suck almost enough to compensate
[16:20] <ZaxKellens> BoH
[16:20] <Superwafflez> nvidia drivers have always been perfect for me
[16:21] <Zaneo> they use depreceate commands
[16:21] <Zaneo> depreceated*
[16:21] <Sparky20> inventroy size must be reduced
[16:21] <Sparky20> or stack size
[16:21] <Mattress> But they can only hold stacks of one pork
[16:21] <CyborgDragon> they live on an alien world 8x the size of earth, with 2x the gravity, and have a weird view angle
[16:21] <Timec> Wai sparky?
[16:21] <ZaxKellens> Ok smartypants, why is it we can carry all that but it takes so many hits to kill a damned spider?
[16:21] <ZaxKellens> With your fist
[16:21] <bildramer> lol
[16:21] <bildramer> too blunt
[16:21] <Sparky20> SUPERSPIDER AWAY!
[16:21] <bildramer> obviously
[16:21] <OpalMist> CyborgDragon: Not counting armor
[16:21] <CyborgDragon> because the spiders are super spiders as well
[16:21] <CyborgDragon> i did factor in armor opal
[16:21] <CyborgDragon> xD
[16:21] <ZaxKellens> Ok, why can't you just shatter the rocks with your fists?
[16:21] <OpalMist> CyborgDragon: Oh, you did? Ok.
[16:21] <Marach> ...drivers are newest
[16:21] * Timec plays on peaceful, so has no quarrels with lil spiders.
[16:21] <bildramer> why can't you eat trees
[16:21] <Superwafflez> I want wireframe minecraft.
[16:21] <CyborgDragon> it's super strong rock
[16:22] <CyborgDragon> zax, it's an alien world
[16:22] <CyborgDragon> anything is possible
[16:22] <Ether> Youtube you sneaky bastards
[16:22] <ZaxKellens> Then who can say that the super strong rock doesn't weigh a few ounces then?
[16:22] <Lmaoboat> Minecrafters are gods what can carry thousands of tons of solid rock, smash through rock with their bare fists, and mold diamond into solid blades. And then they get pushed into the lava by a derp sheep.
[16:22] <ZaxKellens> =O
[16:22] <Superwafflez> You mean google
[16:22] <CyborgDragon> and until notch says bag of holding, im saying they carry it on their backs
[16:22] <bildramer> BECAUSE TREES ARE PEOPLE
[16:22] <ZaxKellens> If it's so alien, those blocks could weigh only a few grams
[16:22] <ZaxKellens> Or whatever
[16:22] <Trapiki> And they can punch the woll clean off the sheep
[16:22] <CyborgDragon> MINECRAFTITANS!
[16:22] <ZaxKellens> So there
[16:22] <OpalMist> CyborgDragon: I'll calculate that, too. See if we come up the same.
[16:22] <ZaxKellens> HA
[16:22] <Ether> Anyone press the soccer ball on youtube videos?
[16:22] <Timec> Why bag of holding o.O
[16:22] <Trapiki> wool*
[16:22] <OpalMist> CyborgDragon: I'm interested, now.
[16:22] <Timec> Did a rucksack not surfice?
[16:22] <CyborgDragon> (19,320 * 64 * 9 * 4 + 19,320 / 9 * 24) * 2
[16:22] <Timec> 4 8 15 16 23 42
[16:22] <Timec> = 108
[16:23] <Superwafflez> Guys, magic is already in the game, invisible backpacks
[16:23] <Timec> o.O
[16:23] <CyborgDragon> the *2 at the end is for the gravity
[16:23] <Timec> 42 is for the universe.

[16:37] <Quatroking> too many mods installed

[16:37] <Sparky20> apart from the sentry bases which I got from disecting the unitect ones.
[16:37] <bildramer> but failed
[16:37] <bildramer> this guy did a better job
[16:38] <Sparky20> And most of my spriting is many weapons merged into one.

[16:39] <OpalMist> The Hulk
[16:39] <ZaxKellens> CyborgDragon : How do you explain the chests then?
[16:39] <Shadaez> OpalMist it's not when you're using a wikianswer of how much gold weighs in inches/feet when minecraft uses meters, and you can easily figure it out only using the metric systtem
[16:39] <ZaxKellens> Well?
[16:39] <ZaxKellens> How?
[16:40] <CyborgDragon> I'll let notch explain those.
[16:40] <Pharod42> Although, if it was yellow, he might have been even stronger while moving it.
[16:40] <ZaxKellens> And how do you explain the SIZE OF THE DAMN BLOCKS not even showing up
[16:40] <ZaxKellens> It's a BoH
[16:40] <OpalMist> Shadaez: I multiplied up into meters
[16:40] <CyborgDragon> We'll just wait until he gets back and we ask him.

[16:40] <CyborgDragon> but until we do, we agree to disagree, okay?
[16:40] <OpalMist> and we can pose the question "Are minecraft avatars stronger than the incredible hulk?"
[16:40] <Shadaez> it's all kinds of backwards.

[16:41] <Pharod42> The Hulk is also very variable in strength. I think it depends on exactly how angry he is.
[16:41] <CyborgDragon> even with the bag of holding
[16:41] <Quatroking> Sparky20, how are your categories called
[16:41] <ZaxKellens> Pharod42 : Correct
[16:41] <CyborgDragon> 64 gold blocks in hand
[16:41] <Sparky20> Err.
[16:41] <CyborgDragon> that's heavier than what the hulk can carry
[16:41] <ZaxKellens> CyborgDragon : You don't have them all out at the same time
[16:41] <Sparky20> Bunker Systems
[16:41] <CyborgDragon> LIES
[16:41] <Sparky20> And Bombs
[16:41] <TotempaaltJ> 64 gold blocks?
[16:41] <Sparky20> And Tools
[16:41] <ZaxKellens> What about when you throw them
[16:41] <bildramer> http://www.thefoodinmybeard.com/2010/05/fried-dough-mozzarella-bites.html
[16:41] <ZaxKellens> You don't throw the stack, you throw one
[16:41] <bildramer> nom
[16:42] <TotempaaltJ> I think 64 iron is heavier.
[16:42] <CyborgDragon> i throw the whole stack zax
[16:42] <CyborgDragon> it's called open inventory, drag and drop stack
[16:42] <Quatroking> alrighty
[16:42] <CyborgDragon> now, let us agree to disagree please
[16:42] <OpalMist> Iron isn't heaver than gold
[16:42] <OpalMist> Is it?
[16:42] <ZaxKellens> Nevah
[16:42] <OpalMist> Gold is maliable
[16:42] <CyborgDragon> it isnt
[16:43] <OpalMist> so it's denser
[16:43] <CyborgDragon> gold is heavier
[16:43] <Sparky20> Quatroking, my spriting sucks.

[16:43] <Sparky20> Quatroking, everything is made from other sprites smashed together and recoloured.
[16:43] <vurtual> This whole time
[16:44] <Superwafflez> holy fuck golds heavy
[16:44] <CyborgDragon> aggregated diamond nanorods beat carbon nanotubes
[16:44] <vurtual> I thought it was 7pm
[16:44] <bildramer> why
[16:44] <vurtual> But it's 7 AM
[16:44] <bildramer> aren't those pretty much the same?
[16:44] <Sparky20> Quatroking, I still need to recolour the cannon.

[16:44] <Sparky20> wat
[16:44] <bildramer> lol
[16:44] <CyborgDragon> yes i know diamond is carbon

[16:44] <bildramer> dammit ninja'd

[16:44] <vurtual> I dunno

[16:45] <CyborgDragon> not carbon nanorods aren't arranged in a crystalline structure
[16:45] <bildramer> well
[16:45] <vurtual> it explodes
[16:45] <ZaxKellens> Lol
[16:45] <CyborgDragon> but*
[16:45] <Sparky20> *cough* diamond isn't an element *cough*
[16:45] <ZaxKellens> Sweet
[16:45] <CyborgDragon> never said it was sparky
[16:45] <bildramer> diamonds are tetrahedral carbon
[16:45] <vurtual> unless you have a ludicrous amount of bags
[16:45] <bildramer> you can't do nanobots with those rods of yours
[16:45] <bildramer> :D
[16:45] <CyborgDragon> aggregated diamond nanorods are arranged in such a way that they are the smallest configuration possible
[16:45] <CyborgDragon> smallest crystalline structure possible known to man
[16:45] <bildramer> yeah yeah
[16:45] <bildramer> diamonds
[16:45] <CyborgDragon> so basically the hardest
[16:45] <bildramer> cut into rods
[16:46] <Timec> I have never found any diamond....by the way does infdev go down vertically forever aswell o.O? I know it doesn't go up.
[16:46] <CyborgDragon> no, not cut into rods
[16:46] <bildramer> yes
[16:46] <bildramer> in the nanoscale
[16:46] <OpalMist> ZaxKellens: Isn't there a table for that?

[16:46] <ZaxKellens> For what?

[16:48] <CyborgDragon> you need to quit oversimplifying things, seriously
[16:48] <bildramer> derp
[16:48] <bildramer> why?
[16:48] <bildramer> It is carbon in a given structure
[16:48] <bildramer> just like carbon, diamonds, nanotubes
[16:48] <CyborgDragon> because simplifying an aggregated diamond nanorod defeats the purpose of unbderstand what it is
[16:49] <bildramer> it is just like carbon nanotubes
[16:49] <bildramer> only without being hollow in the middle
[16:49] <CyborgDragon> no it is different
[16:49] <CyborgDragon> carbon nanotubes arent crystalline in structure
[16:49] <bildramer> and they have tetrahedral structure
[16:49] <bildramer> in big-scale structure, no

[16:59] <Timec> I don't know why I insist on making all of my tunnels aesthtically pleaseing... its making a lot more work, for an already functional tunnel.
[16:59] <Ominus> lol, im glad futurama is back
[16:59] <Kokopure> Timec, how do you make them nice-looking?
[17:00] <CyborgDragon> koko, did you see the problems i said?
[17:00] <Kokopure> with what?
[17:00] <CyborgDragon> the trap
[17:00] <Kokopure> oh
[17:00] <Kokopure> pigs and sheep can get in?
[17:00] <CyborgDragon> the second one as well
[17:00] <Timec> I make the main tunnel bit with cobbles, then have one half wall of wood then the outer walls in cobbles. Then above me I have a cobble tile every 10 tiles as a lamp, with two torchs on.
[17:00] <Kokopure> I think that's kind of unavoidable... they're one-block hih
[17:00] <Kokopure> high*
[17:00] <Timec> It looks good, but its hard lol

[17:00] <Kokopure> they usually struggle and float, though.
[17:01] <CyborgDragon> ah well
[17:01] <Kokopure> and yes
[17:01] <Kokopure> items landing on the outer edges won't float in
[17:01] <CyborgDragon> what about the second one then, i've been trying to figure out a way to get them to do so
[17:01] <CyborgDragon> xD
[17:01] <Kokopure> you could build a trap where there wouldn't -be- any outer edges where there's a dead current, but then you wouldn't be able to trap spiders :x
[17:01] <Kokopure> actually...
[17:01] * Kokopure thinks
[17:01] <CyborgDragon> or...
[17:02] <CyborgDragon> build the walls up so that it all floats in
[17:02] <Kokopure> you could just make the part that traps the spider fairly high up.
[17:02] <Timec> Im thinking I might make a stream, ofc with the water as it is its pretty hard...
[17:02] <CyborgDragon> yeah
[17:02] <Kokopure> and then other mobs would get dragged WAY down.
[17:02] <bildramer> I has idea
[17:02] <CyborgDragon> that's what i was thinking
[17:02] <Kokopure> and only spiders would drown at the toppish.
[17:02] <Kokopure> lemme see what I can do!

[17:32] <Shrub> yeah, decoration
[17:32] <Shrub> they'd act like a fluid
[17:32] <Monte> BE TURNED INTO A COMPLEX MINING SIMULATION
[17:32] <Shrub> but you wouldn't be able to collide with it or anythin
[17:33] <Merciless> MOLE PEOPLE
[17:33] <Shrub> there'd be an ant 'spring' and it would go along till a certain point where there's a 'hole'
[17:33] <CyborgDragon> no Sqiushy ants?
[17:33] <CyborgDragon> D:
[17:33] <Shrub> or something
[17:33] <Kokopure> I think ants would be fantastic as decoration
[17:33] <Kokopure> however
[17:33] <Kokopure> I think they should also try to drag away entities.
[17:33] <Merciless> SPEAKING OF NPC'S I ONLY EVER FIND SHEEP AND PIGS
[17:33] <Kokopure> not, like creepers
[17:33] <Shrub> lol
[17:33] <Monte> also
[17:33] <Kokopure> but, like...
[17:33] <Merciless> NOT A SINGLE ANEMY NOTCH
[17:33] <Shrub> yes like in cartoons
[17:33] <Monte> speaking of creepers
[17:33] <Monte> dude
[17:33] <Merciless> WHATS UP
[17:33] <Kokopure> drag away pig meat.
[17:33] <Monte> I was looking around in my garage
[17:33] <Shrub> where they pick up tons of shit
[17:33] <Kokopure> things you can drop.
[17:33] <Merciless> *enemy
[17:33] <Monte> and there's a weight lifting bench
[17:33] <Shrub> yeah
[17:33] <Monte> called "creeper"
[17:33] <Kokopure> and then deposit it in underground "and chests" :3
[17:34] <Shrub> lol koko that'd be sweet
[17:34] <Shrub> or or
[17:34] <CyborgDragon> Jeepers
[17:34] <Shrub> bees
[17:34] <CyborgDragon> Creepers
[17:34] <CyborgDragon> Where'd you get those peepers?
[17:34] <Kokopure> everything needs moar bees
[17:34] <CyborgDragon> Jeepers
[17:34] <Shrub> and they form epic shapes in the sky and kll you
[17:34] <CyborgDragon> Creepers
[17:34] <CyborgDragon> Where'd you get those eyes?
[17:34] <Shrub> or have some cowbells lying all over the ground
[17:34] <Kokopure> I think you should be able to craft a cowbell, and ring it
[17:34] <CyborgDragon> You will now hear that song in your head whenever you see a creeper.
[17:34] <Kokopure> and farm mobs will come towards you.

[17:59] <Kokopure> WAHOO
[17:59] <Kokopure> I was trying to record my mob trap working
[17:59] <Kokopure> so I was luring a zombie to its doom
[18:00] <Shrub> go on
[18:00] <Kokopure> and then outta freakin' nowhere
[18:00] <Kokopure> I get attacked into the water
[18:00] <Shrub> D:
[18:00] <Kokopure> mother-effin' Spider snuck up from behind

[18:00] <Kokopure> I manage to get out, but the spider gets pulled under :D
[18:00] <CyborgDragon> koko, using your trap i found something out
[18:00] <Kokopure> THEN I WATCHED THEM BOTH SUFFOCATE MUWAHAHA
[18:00] <Shrub> "I manage to get out, but the spider gets pulled under :D"
[18:00] <Shrub> badass
[18:00] <Kokopure> AND

[18:01] <Kokopure> YES
[18:01] <Shrub> Perfect Minecraft Video?!
[18:01] <Shrub> YES!
[18:01] <CyborgDragon> koko, i found out that water pulls you down even if you're holding forward on a ladder
[18:01] <Kokopure> oh really?
[18:01] <Kokopure> I make it so I have to jump for my ladder.
[18:01] <CyborgDragon> so you have to hold both forward and jump until you're free of the water's grasp
[18:01] <Kokopure> you could probably make a player-drowning pit if you worked hard enough.
[18:02] <Kokopure> all it would take is a moment's inattention.
[18:02] <CyborgDragon> make it deep
[18:02] <Kokopure> make it deep, and make it turn.

[18:22] <Ominus> yes
[18:22] <hoopz> should be able to pick carts up as well
[18:22] <Timecatcher> Kokopure: Your video is good but I can't see much lol...minecraft does have torches you know.
[18:22] <Monte> now we wait for minecraft to finish blowing up these- PROGRAM HAS STOPPED RESPONDING
[18:22] <Dragoon> Velocity gets it up the hill.
[18:22] <Ominus> its kinda annoying when ur pushing more than 1 cart and they keep bumping
[18:22] <Ominus> and bouncing off eachother
[18:22] <hoopz> i mean he didnt mention it i dont think, but he did it in the demo video
[18:22] <Timecatcher> Velocity doesn't exist when you have no down hill...

[21:14] <Heinoji> Ev'ry day I'm shovelin'
[21:14] <vede> Yeah, 4x4 sprites for everything makes art hella easy, since I know making anything that looks really good is basically impossible anyway.
[21:14] <Speljohan__> yep
[21:14] <Speljohan__> cus art design is boring and tedious

[21:46] <CyborgDragon> UPDATE
[21:46] <Azathoth> stfu
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> NO JOKE
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> http://notch.tumblr.com/
[21:46] <Azathoth> oh. lol
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> Here???s a review of something I recently bought
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> No, just kidding, I updated infdev.
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> + New save file format
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> + Tweaked rail laying code, it???s much better now
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> + Better fps
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> + Less crashy, and when it does crash, it should give a nice error screen with instructions on how to proceed
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> + Rideable minecarts, but you can???t open them yet
[21:46] <Azathoth> yeah we get it. you can stop
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> The first time you save a level after this update, it???s fairly slow, but after that, it should be a LOT faster.
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> Old levels should still load zones will get converted into the new system as you explore the map, so make sure to run around a lot.
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> I don???t know if I fixed the crash bugs on linux, I can???t get a network connection on my ubuntu on the mac. I would, if I could download the wifi drivers, or if the wired internet would work..
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> On a personal note, there???s some shit going on at the moment. :-\ Bleh.
[21:46] <CyborgDragon> aight
[21:46] <Speljohan__> brb rideable minecarts

[21:55] <Marach> omg, generation is at 50% already!
[21:55] <Drewseph> I used to get smooth frame rates
[21:55] <Darkebrz> I thought the whole point of the update was so that there wasn't lag
[21:56] <TerraSleet> update O_o
[21:56] <CyborgDragon> in other news
[21:56] <Drewseph> but now its just constantly updating 140 chunks

[21:59] <bildramer> hum
[22:00] <Darkebrz> TkTech, shut up

[22:06] <Darkebrz> But it hangs
[22:06] <ZaxKellens> *dances*
[22:06] <Drewseph> but there is no need for 90-150fps

[22:06] <Azathoth> yeah
[22:06] <cryzed> Hopefully it crashes for many of you and hangs so you guys realize that it's not oh so fun and rainbows "to deal with it" "and get over with it". Sure you can say that if it works for you

[22:26] <Azathoth> i mean i've done it before, but i don't really feel like burning a CD :|
[22:26] <vede> cryzed, just go to the Software Source thingy and change the repo with "lucid" in it to "jaunty" or "karmic" or something.

[22:37] <Azathoth> well that's sometimes frowned upon
[22:37] <bildramer> you should, but it's not really a problem
[22:37] <vede> Azathoth, Ubuntu (and Mint and others too) will automatically present you with the option to install nvidia's drivers.

[22:37] <bildramer> I use one too because I can't with a browser :/
[22:37] <Bhro> i would prefer to use the browser, but it just black screens me when i load my save

[22:37] <vede> Like "Hey there's drivers. Install Y/N"
[22:37] <Azathoth> ok, cool
[22:37] <ZaxKellens> Well?
[22:38] <Bhro> anyone know how to make the game not give me a black screen?
[22:38] <vede> I really recommend Mint if you want to use something that's really easy to use, though.
[22:38] <Azathoth> last time i tried linux, it was years ago and it was hardly user friendly

[22:59] <bildramer> no
[22:59] <Diablodoct0r> You can download Minecraft.js legally from the site
[22:59] <Diablodoct0r> So why not infdev
[22:59] <bildramer> there will be a downloadable Minecraft version
[22:59] <Diablodoct0r> (From the minecraft.net site)

[23:00] <bildramer> you get stuck
[23:00] <vede> Diablodoct0r, you're trying to get help so you can use something with the WoM client. You said that explicitly. That is not allowed here.
[23:00] <Diablodoct0r> erm
[23:00] <vede> Go to the WoM channel if you need help with anything regarding WoM.
[23:00] <Fractal_AFK> Gunmage: you really don't
[23:00] <Diablodoct0r> vede. I'd be using it WITHOUT the client if I had to.
[23:00] <Dragoon> So do the worlds (1,2,3,etc) represent indev or infdev?
[23:00] <Gunmage> Wait, is the rideable minecart update out yet?
[23:00] <GoaLitiuM> ehm, no custom client kind of talk here?
[23:00] <bildramer> you cannot run the .jar without a client

[23:00] <Gunmage> NICE

[23:00] <bildramer> and talking about a client is not allowed here
[23:00] <Gunmage> AND I HAVE IRON, NICE
[23:00] <Aeomin> custom server/client not allowed
[23:00] <Fractal_AFK> what you do is build another one, jump in, and then jump out
[23:00] <bildramer> probably there is an infdev wrapper but I don't know
[23:01] <vede> Holy shit, does no one ever read the rules?
[23:01] <vede> I mean, seriously.
[23:01] <Diablodoct0r> apparently :p
[23:01] <Zaneo> how many did you find gunmage?
[23:01] <Askee> I tend to forget rules that aren't obvious ones like dont be a dick
[23:01] <Askee> lol
[23:01] <Diablodoct0r> me too
[23:01] <Omnicide> if it isnt in topic it isnt a rule
[23:01] <Fractal_AFK> Is there only one cart at the moment?
[23:01] * Fractal_AFK is now known as Fractal
[23:01] <bildramer> vede, someone should make a bot to ask everyone who enters a question regarding the rules
[23:01] <bildramer> or something similar

[23:01] <Diablodoct0r> Well Said, Omnicide
[23:01] <Diablodoct0r> Well said :D

[23:06] <Diablodoct0r> Since we can't talk about Servers..
[23:06] <vede> The comic has a chick who wants to make cuddly with the guy, so she cleverly says "I'm feeling cold" so he would hold her (to make her warm, but she really just wants the holding part), and he gives her a blanket. Five years later, he realizes what she was actually wanting and rages because he missed an awesome opportunity.
[23:06] <Diablodoct0r> =/
[23:06] <Darkebrz> We can talk about editors
[23:06] <Diablodoct0r> ok sweet

[23:07] <Darkebrz> And he has a HUGE room that has extremelly dark areas

[23:07] <vede> .__.

[23:07] * ZaxKellens|INFDEV stabs everyone
[23:07] <Darkebrz> Then gets into the main room
[23:07] <Darkebrz> There are HUNDREDS of monsters

[23:08] <bildramer> ZaxKellens
[23:08] <bildramer> stop stabbing
[23:08] <ZaxKellens|INFDEV> Why?
[23:08] <Darkebrz> And he just runs all the way to the other side while they fall in behind him
[23:08] <ZaxKellens|INFDEV> It's fun...
[23:08] <Darkebrz> And then when he goes back he sets it on easy
[23:08] <Darkebrz> Thinking it would be a lot easier
[23:08] <Darkebrz> So he walks in, look to the left
[23:08] <Darkebrz> No monsters at all
[23:08] <ZaxKellens|INFDEV> Right?
[23:08] <Darkebrz> Then he turns around, HUNDREDS OF MONSTERS BARRELING DOWN ON HIM
[23:08] <ZaxKellens|INFDEV> BWHAHAHA
[23:08] <Darkebrz> And just runs back and sets it on peaceful

[23:25] <Demki> I am free.
[23:25] <Favlaud> Because no lie, skeletons especially scare the shit out of me every single time
[23:25] <Fractal> Does the new level gen use the level.dat file?

[23:26] <Demki> fractal yes.
[23:26] <Favlaud> Even when I know they're there, the TWANG makes me jump
[23:26] <thechris> so we can NBT edit it?
[23:26] <Fractal> yes
[23:26] <thechris> cool
[23:26] <thechris> minecarts here we come
[23:26] <Demki> yes, minecarts are fun to ride on.
[23:26] <Demki> but beware
[23:26] <vurtual> guys I had this new idea for a new difficulty.
[23:26] * thechris waits to see me fail and ruin the save
[23:27] <vurtual> where mobs are rare normally
[23:27] <vurtual> but then they siege you sometimes
[23:27] <Demki> if there any low blocks, your head will get in and you will suffocate.
[23:27] <vurtual> suddenly, semi-randomly occouring in larger numbers for a while
[23:27] <vurtual> but only from the map edge
[23:27] <hoopz> the hardest difficulty should be called "come out neville"
[23:27] <vurtual> and attacking you
[23:27] <TW|Napping> "You Must Die" mode
[23:27] <vurtual> so it's like you have to defend the base

[23:27] <Azathoth> that's weird
[23:27] <Demki> oh, and for some reason, minecraft now has regular "freezes" which basically freeze minecraft for a fraction of a second.
[23:27] <Azathoth> i should have just gone with vede's suggestion
[23:28] <Vicrry> guyz I had this awesome idea. A difficulty mode where the pigs and sheeps don't friggin spawn. So they stay the frak out of the greenhouse.
[23:28] <Felime> *TWANG* OH GOD OH GOD *spazzes out and shakes his mouse running away*
[23:28] <Demki> well, at least for me.
[23:28] <thechris> o.O were are my infdev saves?
[23:28] <vurtual> Something I learned today
[23:28] <cryzed> Demki, yup have that too
[23:28] <Azathoth> for some reason the ubuntu windows installer things i have an amd64 processor :|
[23:28] <Azathoth> thinks*
[23:28] <vurtual> So, basically, the power went out while I was half-sitting in the shower, half lying down, relaxed in all the heat
[23:28] <Wampbit> That would be quite fun vurtual - some destructability would be awesome, repairs/needed fortifications could be fun

[23:28] <vurtual> Wampbit, creepers
[23:28] <Gunmage> My god obama is stupid
[23:28] <Felime> the performance should speed up a bit if you turn it to peaceful, then wander around the area around your base a bit
[23:28] <vurtual> make them use their siege-your-base AI
[23:28] <Demki> those are probably regular ticks.
[23:29] <Gunmage> Does he actually think he will hurt piracy?

[23:30] <FNugget> TheMilkMan: old save or new save?
[23:30] <TerraSleet> its like 50x slower
[23:30] <Gunmage> There are studies that say piracy helps the economy
[23:30] <TheMilkMan> Old save
[23:30] * Lilyo (Mibbit@cpe-67-248-162-40.nycap.res.rr.com) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[23:30] <TheMilkMan> I haven't tried a new save
[23:30] <Demki> Terra, he said that the first time saving is slower.
[23:30] <FNugget> my new ones work fine
[23:30] <hoopz> it doesnt really matter because most good labels arent associated with the riaa
[23:30] <Felime> cloth is now whiter, it's for notch setting up colored cloth
[23:30] <vede> Seeing how he actively works to make it harder for people to produce their own creative content online.
[23:30] <Gunmage> And the studies that say it hurts the economy are by the entertainment industries
[23:30] <Felime> IT IS SLOW THE FIRST TIME!
[23:30] <hoopz> see http://www.riaaradar.com/
[23:30] <vurtual> there should be two new harder difficulties: A special siege one
[23:30] <TheMilkMan> It's supposed to lag ever 2 secs while walking around?
[23:30] <Gunmage> What annoyed me
[23:30] <vurtual> and then hardest difficulty should be "Nightmare!"
[23:30] <Louis> I'm having the same problem Terra, even after multiple saves and loads, it's still slower than dirt.
[23:30] <vede> All he wants is for content he approves of to be protected, and everything else to be forbidden.
[23:31] <Gunmage> Is that I had an awesome cave that went on seemingly forever
[23:31] <Gunmage> And now it is gone
[23:31] <Gunmage> Poof
[23:31] <FNugget> Obama doesn't make ideas like that. Presidents make decisions, not ideas.
[23:31] <Felime> @Milkman: yes, the conversion happens as you walk around. As you get to area that needs converting, it lags
[23:31] <vurtual> where monsters are superstrong, and respawn from their last mob spawn a few times if it's out of your view.
[23:31] <TheMilkMan> aw damn
[23:31] <TerraSleet> Felime: I just generated a new map
[23:31] <TheMilkMan> Will a new save not do that?
[23:31] <Felime> I think now
[23:31] <Felime> not*
[23:31] <TerraSleet> and it's lagging like shit
[23:31] <Felime> haven't tested it
[23:31] <TheMilkMan> I'll try a new save
[23:31] <Felime> oh :(
[23:31] <vurtual> along with sieges and other dangers, super-fast arrows from skeletons that can hit you mroe easily
[23:31] <Azathoth> holy shit. steam....
[23:31] <thechris> holy crap, theres a lot of active people....
[23:31] <vurtual> but you gain double from crafting.
[23:31] <Alram> I can't even start new saves

[23:32] <cryzed> Just reposting that regularly
[23:32] <cryzed> so everyone gets it
[23:32] <Fractal> If you guys are digging, and there is lava in your way, what do you do with it?
[23:32] <Felime> Notch broke minecraft :(
[23:32] <thechris> what azathoth?

[23:32] <cryzed> Fractal, eat
[23:32] <Azathoth> massive steam sale
[23:32] <cryzed> vurtual, that works too
[23:32] <FNugget> find sauce, bukkit
[23:32] <thechris> oh
[23:32] <bildramer> duh
[23:32] <TerraSleet> notch modifying saves was pretty un-necessary anyway
[23:32] <TerraSleet> it was fine as it is
[23:32] <Felime> it was running well now
[23:32] <bildramer> nope
[23:32] <TerraSleet> the only problem was loading
[23:32] <Vicrry> Best idea evar: Instead of a superduper hard difficulty, why not just change all the air blocks to lava. It'd be awesome
[23:33] <Gunmage> HOLY GOD
[23:33] <Fractal> Do you dig another pit, put the sources in it, or make obsidian, and hope for diamond so you can mine it?
[23:33] <vurtual> NO
[23:33] <Felime> more of a thing setting up for Multiplayer
[23:33] <hoopz> nnno it wasnt
[23:33] <vurtual> NO NO :(
[23:33] <Gunmage> I destroyed one sand tile

[23:33] <Monte> Am I the only one who got the Blacksheep glitch

[23:33] <Gunmage> And there was a giant avalanche
[23:33] <Monte> Was so cash
[23:33] <Azathoth> yeah
[23:33] <thechris> mine is so slow! 15fps(if lucky) and i still have 94% free mem.!
[23:33] <TerraSleet> and i just generated a new map, whenever i turn my view it spikes out
[23:33] <Omnicide> i dont think there are such things as air blocks
[23:33] <Monte> BlackSheep glitch is awesome
[23:33] <FNugget> Monte: i got it

[23:35] <Monte> to make the rollercoaster go on forever

[23:35] <vurtual> ahahahaha, wtf
[23:35] <vurtual> Look at the bottom
[23:35] <Monte> vacbanned?
[23:35] <Darkebrz> Azathoth, why were you VAC banned
[23:35] <vurtual> individual price vs package price.
[23:35] <Azathoth> but i don't have multiwinia and uplink
[23:35] <Monte> why?
[23:35] <Azathoth> and uplink is awesome

[23:36] <vurtual> TheMilkMan, I'm worse
[23:36] <Azathoth> i think my account got stolen and somebody hacked on it or something
[23:36] <Monte> IS BECAUSE I SET A FOREST ON FIRE.
[23:36] <vurtual> I use it to cheaply buy games
[23:36] <vurtual> but then the only persno with a valid credit card in my family is gone
[23:36] <TerraSleet> Chrome could be a possible reason Minecraft lags me
[23:36] <Fractal> I love cheating in games.

[23:38] <Gunmage> FEAR is 10$
[23:39] <Felime> OH GOD GROUND CREEPERS
[23:39] <vurtual> That'd kill the xbox pretty hard, man.

[23:40] <TerraSleet> ^
[23:40] <vurtual> that'd be pretty funny
[23:40] <Felime> hehehe
[23:40] <TerraSleet> steam on wii oh please no
[23:40] <Felime> okay
[23:40] <TerraSleet> 4 year olds on my tf2?
[23:40] <Felime> I should probably report this bug...

[23:40] <Fractal> oink, oink, oink, squeal, (lava) Hiss!
[23:40] <TerraSleet> it's more likely than you think
[23:40] <Darkebrz> Felime, what bug
[23:40] <ZaxKellens|INFDEV> Dammit Terra
[23:41] <Felime> one sec
[23:41] <Darkebrz> oh
[23:41] <Felime> crafting a screenshot
[23:41] <vurtual> TerraSleet, I'd do it, just because it'd mean a 99% chance of playing TF2 and half-life 2 with wiimote support.
[23:41] <TerraSleet> that'd be interesting
[23:41] <vurtual> and PORTAL!
[23:41] <TerraSleet> still wouldn't beat mouse + keyboard though
[23:41] <bildramer> I thought of portal first

[23:41] <Serow> Anyone been having problems with overactive sheep spawn?
[23:41] <TerraSleet> portal on the wii would be great
[23:41] <Marach> what's the smallest illegal to share file?
[23:41] <TerraSleet> as a gimmick
[23:41] <vurtual> Yeah you sorta do beat the mouse and keyboard once you have "point and shoot"
[23:41] <vurtual> it's not like you have less reaction
[23:41] <TerraSleet> but would get old fast and tbh pretty fiddly
[23:41] <TheMilkMan> Fps on the wii is no fun :(
[23:42] <vurtual> corruption was really easy to aim in even with IR sources messing with it, because after a while it was like using a mouse if you wanted.
[23:42] <Omnicide> fps on the wii is the one thing that felt more natural than pc
[23:42] <Darkebrz> Should I buy the Call of Duty pack?
[23:42] <Marach> Darkebrz: no

[23:42] <TerraSleet> vurtual, if you've played resi evil on the wii you'll know why fpses on the wii don't beat mouse+keyboard
[23:42] <TheMilkMan> I didn't like how to turn left or right to aim
[23:42] <Darkebrz> vurtual, pack doesnt include MW2
[23:42] <vurtual> Did you play prime 3?
[23:42] <Felime> bug
[23:42] <vurtual> enemy AC-130 below.
[23:42] * vurtual steps on it
[23:42] <Marach> lol

[23:43] <Marach> poor enemy ad-130 :/
[23:43] <Marach> ac*
[23:43] <Darkebrz> Felime, what is the bug
[23:43] <Pikablu> ...wow
[23:43] <TerraSleet> ac-130s irl are crap
[23:43] <Pikablu> this update sucks
[23:43] <Marach> Demki: this one's 16 bytes

[23:43] <TerraSleet> agree, pikablu
[23:43] <vurtual> virtual console cross-support on steam, meaning steam games on the wii, and virtual console games on the PC.
[23:43] <TerraSleet> saves memory but lags like FUCK
[23:43] <Demki> 16 bytes? are you sure?

[23:43] <Felime> THIS IS THE BUG
[23:43] <Marach> the private key nintendo wii uses to sign the binaries
[23:43] <Demki> I meant JUST the password.
[23:43] <vurtual> felime can we trust you?
[23:43] <Felime> mobs spawning in the ground
[23:43] <Darkebrz> oh its in the ground

[23:53] <Wampbit> They certainly do boost the publicity of it, and many other things for that matter. The thing is this area can't really be policed, unless a great firewall is introduced like that seen in China, the various infringement laws are nigh on impossible to enforce outside of specific cases that are used as examples.

Imagine if it was possible to craft paper sheets and pencils from wood! when using them, a paper sheet appear on the screen kinda like the signs and then you can draw on it in game. Then you can make drawings and plans. Cool in game maps as well. :D Books could be made in the same manner by combining paper sheets. Then ou can write stuff like on the signs. Paper and books could neatly fill
