[2:21] <vede> (Well, I am by your standards, anyway...)
[2:21] <Azathoth> they didn't make it with a combination of deltas or something?

[2:25] <Eagle> *30
[2:25] <Azathoth> what?
[2:25] <Azathoth> how do you do it?
[2:25] <Eagle> Hold down Alt, then type in "30" on the numpad
[2:26] <Azathoth> hitting alt+30 doesn't do anything for me
[2:26] <Azathoth> (and yes i did it on the numpad)
[2:26] <Eagle> Open up notepad and do it in that
[2:26] <Azathoth> ah
[2:26] <Eagle> Sometimes irc clients don't allow you to type alt codes
[2:26] <Eagle> but you can still copy and paste

[2:34] <TestDummy> "Although practically a physicist needs only 39 digits of Pi to make a circle the size of the observable universe accurate to one atom of hydrogen, the number itself as a mathematical curiosity has created many challenges in different fields."

[2:49] <Azathoth> it's like a super advanced cart
[2:50] <Azathoth> instead of wheels, it uses balls
[2:50] <Konogan> Balls...
[2:50] <outsomnia> ???????????????????????????????????????
[2:50] <vede> The wheelbarrow and rotating rectangle can be achieved with rotating wheels, and we already have a better robot for carrying small loads. It's just like that one, except it has multiple wheels so it can navigate rough terrain.

[2:50] <Konogan> Bold Balls...
[2:51] <outsomnia> ???????????????
[2:51] <vede> I mean, it's fuckin' cool, but in terms of applicability, it's a step backward.
[2:51] <Azathoth> actually it seems like it would make a decent enough method of locomotion for household robots or something
[2:51] <Quatroking> baaaaalls of steeeel
[2:51] <Azathoth> it's not as awkward as legs
[2:51] <Azathoth> doesn't have to turn and things

[2:52] <outsomnia> ????????????????????????????????????
[2:52] <Azathoth> lol
[2:52] <bildramer> it runs with the ball to soldiers
[2:52] <bildramer> and kablam

[2:53] <vede> bildramer, why would the robot come out?
[2:53] <bildramer> if it was on the ball already it would get smashed on impact
[2:53] <bildramer> probably
[2:53] <vede> Keep the robot inside, make the ball a hard, transparent plastic, then have the robot+camera setup balance on the inside.
[2:53] <Quatroking> I seem to be pretty influensive when it comes to the forums
[2:53] <bildramer> also, bowling bots
[2:53] <bildramer> lol
[2:53] <Azathoth> influensive?

[2:54] <Azathoth> lol
[2:54] <bildramer> it's probably a word
[2:54] <vede> Then you don't have to worry about the primary processing area being damaged by kids throwing rocks.

[3:18] <bildramer> lol
[3:18] <Azathoth> seems like it was more than $4 per mb

[3:19] <bildramer> and floppies <3

[3:25] <Konogan|AFK> What's your videocard ram?
[3:25] <Dommys> Because you're running a 32x winos. and or, your motherboard doesn't support the amount of ram you've installed
[3:25] * MarkofBear (chatzilla@213-66-202-160-no30.tbcn.telia.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[3:25] <Azathoth> 512mb
[3:26] <Malikat> gentlemen
[3:26] <Malikat> i have an announcement
[3:26] <Dommys> Mentlegen
[3:26] <Azathoth> my motherboard supports more than the amount i've got installed
[3:26] <Shadae> If you have Wundiws 32-bit it only allows you to have 4 GB RAM total, including VRAM.
[3:26] <Jake> aye?
[3:26] <Konogan|AFK> what's your current amount of ram?
[3:26] <xslay3rx> you're pregnant?
[3:26] <Malikat> Corn.
[3:26] <Azathoth> 4 gb
[3:26] * ClassiestMedic (Kevjohnson@pool-141-154-114-194.bstnma.btas.verizon.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[3:26] <Dommys> Corn is delicious
[3:26] <Konogan|AFK> detected RAM?
[3:26] <xslay3rx> Actually, Malikat makes a good point.
[3:26] <xslay3rx> Corn rules the world.
[3:26] <Malikat> Konogan|AFK: 6gb not counting the 32gb i downloaded
[3:26] <Azathoth> 4.00 GB (3.25 GB usable)
[3:26] <xslay3rx> It's in EVERYTHING... ssshhh don't tell anyone.
[3:26] <Dommys> Speaking of Corn, I want some Grits.
[3:27] <Konogan|AFK> What's the age of your motherboard?
[3:27] <Jake> what do the shapes mean?
[3:27] <Jake> deep, long and square?
[3:27] <Konogan|AFK> maybe it doesn't support 4GB.

[3:27] <Jake> long mens n*m map where n>m?
[3:27] <Azathoth> i'm pretty sure it supports 8 or something
[3:27] <xslay3rx> Isn't grits hominy?
[3:27] <Dommys> http://www.todd-berger.com/Grits_4_Gold.html
[3:27] <Azathoth> i'll see if it's still on newegg. i don't remember exactly which one i got
[3:27] <Konogan|AFK> Well, switch to 64bits.
[3:27] <Icereed> hi
[3:27] * Shadae is now known as Shadaez
[3:27] <Azathoth> i don't want to use a 64 bit os D:
[3:27] <Konogan|AFK> Why?
[3:28] <Dommys> You're doin' wrong, You're doin' wrong!
[3:28] <Shadaez> If you have Wundiws 32-bit it only allows you to have 4 GB RAM total, including VRAM.
[3:28] <Azathoth> because there are still a lot of compatability issues
[3:28] <Dommys> Michael said it best.
[3:28] * Icereed (irchon@mnch-5d854895.pool.mediaWays.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[3:28] <Dommys> No, there isn't.

[3:28] <Azathoth> yes shadaez, i am aware
[3:28] <Konogan|AFK> Azathot, no.
[3:28] <Azathoth> but it's only saying i have 3.25gb
[3:28] <Icereed> im kinda drunk :/
[3:28] <Shadaez> It doesn't count VRAM in that
[3:28] <Dommys> Anything that doesn't work on Win7x64, didn't work well enough in the first place.
[3:28] <Azathoth> ok?
[3:28] <Icereed> lawl
[3:28] <Azathoth> i have 4 gb of memory, not including vram
[3:28] <Konogan|AFK> Azathoth, there's no compatibility issue, 64 bits osses can run 32-bit programs normally.
[3:29] <Shadaez> Your Videocard has 768 MB VRAM, I assime?
[3:29] <TestDummy> Azathoth: Remember, eveything has to map within 4GB of space.

[3:29] <Dommys> lol
[3:29] <TestDummy> That and Windows likes to take part of the memory for caching purposes.
[3:29] <Malikat> here guys you need more ram
[3:29] <Icereed> oh shit. everything is turning
[3:29] <shapeshiftr> You have died of dysentery.
[3:29] <Malikat> download some more
[3:29] <TestDummy> Last I checked, 3.25GB on a 32-bit system with 4GB of RAM installed is nothing abornal.
[3:29] <Azathoth> well that's fucking lame
[3:29] <TestDummy> It doesn't make perfect sense mathmatically, but there's a reason it's that way.
[3:29] <Malikat> Azathoth you need to download more
[3:30] <Azathoth> alright
[3:30] <TestDummy> Run a 64-bit operating system then. :)
[3:30] <Icereed> mew
[3:30] <shapeshiftr> like?
[3:30] <Azathoth> i always thought there were compatability issues with 64 bit, particularly with drivers
[3:30] <Konogan|AFK> That download RAM thing, <3.
[3:30] <Shadaez> There are virtually none for most users.
[3:30] <Azathoth> but i guess that may have been mostly fixed by now :\ i dunno
[3:30] <Shadaez> Esp on Windows 7
[3:30] <Konogan|AFK> Azathoth, not these days.
[3:30] <TestDummy> Well, 64-bit drivers in Vista and 7 must be digitally signed.
[3:30] <Icereed> i gtg sleeping...
[3:30] * Icereed (irchon@mnch-5d854895.pool.mediaWays.net) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[3:31] <Quatroking> isn't pretty much everything 64-bit these days
[3:31] <TestDummy> But I haven't had any trouble with the 64-bit setup that I've used since what... 2008?
[3:31] <Quatroking> I mean, it would be silly to design towards 32-bit
[3:31] <TestDummy> The software isn't quite yet.
[3:31] * bildramer downloads some RAM
[3:31] <TestDummy> But that's nothing unusual.
[3:31] <Konogan|AFK> Malikat, thanks for RAMs. :D
[3:31] <Azathoth> i do already have a 64 bit processor, so i'd just have to upgrade the OS, but that costs money anyway :P
[3:31] <Konogan|AFK> XD
[3:31] <TestDummy> 32-bit took time to catch on. :)
[3:31] <Shadaez> Nope, Azathoth your license covers both. You just need to download a 64-bit ISO
[3:31] <Malikat> Konogan|AFK how much did you download
[3:31] <Konogan|AFK> When does OSes started costing money? lol.
[3:32] <Konogan|AFK> Malikat, >9k
[3:32] <Azathoth> when i like playing games so i can't use linux?
[3:32] <bildramer> mwhahaha
[3:32] <Konogan|AFK> Azathoth, I know that, I mean...
[3:32] <bildramer> now I have 16GB
[3:32] <Azathoth> i don't pirate shit
[3:32] <Azathoth> if that's what you mean
[3:32] <Konogan|AFK> What?
[3:32] <TestDummy> Argh!
[3:32] <Konogan|AFK> You said it.
[3:32] <TestDummy> X_O
[3:32] <TestDummy> I'm a pirate!
[3:32] <bildramer> Hgra!
[3:32] <Dommys> Azathoth doesn't Pirate anything
[3:32] <Dommys> At all.
[3:32] <TestDummy> I've got an eyepatch.
[3:33] <bildramer> yarrrrrrrrrrrrr
[3:33] <Azathoth> just old games you can't get anymore
[3:33] <bildramer> ahoy mateys
[3:33] <Dommys> Azathoth you are a liar
[3:33] <Shadaez> Like i Said
[3:33] <Quatroking> I don't pirate OS'es either
[3:33] <Shadaez> your license covers both
[3:33] <Azathoth> how am i a liar?
[3:33] <Quatroking> I get them for free using myschool

[3:33] <Azathoth> your school?
[3:33] <bildramer> September 19th
[3:33] <Quatroking> Yes, I get free software.
[3:33] <Dommys> When Command and Conquer went FREE TO DOWNLOAD, you said You won't download them because you could probably still find the boxed version in a store.
[3:33] <bildramer> hm
[3:33] <Animator> YARR HARR WE MUST BRING AZATHOTH AND TIE HIM UP ON THE PLANK SO HE CAN WATCH US LOOT AND PLUNDERRRRRR!
[3:33] <Dommys> EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE OLD AND FREE
[3:33] <Quatroking> Azathoth, remember, I'm an IT student :3
[3:33] <bildramer> good night
[3:34] <Azathoth> i said that, dommys?
[3:34] * TestDummy is guessinsg Quatroking has access to something like MSDNAA
[3:34] <Dommys> Yes
[3:34] <Azathoth> i think you must be mistaken
[3:34] <Quatroking> yes, MSDNAA
[3:34] <Dommys> The night we told you about CnC being released free
[3:34] <Azathoth> seriously. i don't think i was even here when that happened
[3:34] <Quatroking> I got the full version of Win7 before it went public
[3:34] <xslay3rx> any geoscientists in here?
[3:34] <Quatroking> like, two weeks before it got released
[3:34] <TestDummy> Quatroking: :(
[3:34] <Azathoth> i get discounted software, but not free :(
[3:35] <Quatroking> Media releases are sweet
[3:35] <Azathoth> i got the win 7 upgrade for $30
[3:35] <Quatroking> ready to market version

[3:36] <TestDummy> Quatroking: Office isn't on MSDNAA.
[3:36] <Quatroking> no shit
[3:36] <TestDummy> You have to be a TechNet subscriber for that.
[3:36] <Quatroking> how much does that cost

[3:37] <Azathoth> which kind of sucks, but it does almost everything ms office can, and is free
[3:37] <Azathoth> so fuck it
[3:37] <Quatroking> Azathoth, I'm an OO.o user for years
[3:37] <TestDummy> I know some people who do actually have subscriptions, and make that fee work for them.
[3:37] <Azathoth> me too, but OO gets on my nerves sometimes
[3:37] <Dommys> OpenOffice is fantastic
[3:37] <Konogan|AFK> ^
[3:37] <TestDummy> It's better than it used to be.
[3:37] <xslay3rx> Personally I prefer a more private office.
[3:37] <Konogan|AFK> Cause it's free.
[3:37] <Azathoth> lol slayer
[3:38] <Quatroking> "MSDN Library May 2006"
[3:38] <Dommys> I was there when they released.
[3:38] <Azathoth> and then those bastards at microshit came up with .docx
[3:38] <Azathoth> and then i couldn't open any of them in OO
[3:38] <Quatroking> are these CD's with all of MSDN's software on it?
[3:38] <Dommys> I used it mostly for an At Home Excel replacement
[3:38] <xslay3rx> It's just weird ya know? Like If I'm looking at online langerie, I don't want people peeking through a window behind me and get good ideas...

[3:50] <Quatroking> I'm taking the average because its a lot more fair
[3:50] <Quatroking> my base score is now a 7.06
[3:50] <Quatroking> take that
[3:51] <Azathoth> i guess the WEI is just supposed to be a replacement for minimum requirements or something
[3:51] <Azathoth> so it makes sense to use the lowest subscore
[3:51] <Malikat> basically, yeah
[3:51] <Konogan|AFK> Wow, your 4870 is 6.0? mine is 4800 :P
[3:51] <Konogan|AFK> 7.3*
[3:51] <Malikat> except when it sees the hard drive, it should ignore the hard drive
[3:51] <Azathoth> my 8800gt is 6.9
[3:51] <Konogan|AFK> Lol, Nvidia.
[3:51] <Dommys> Overclocking it? I think mine is underclocked at the moment
[3:51] <Quatroking> is visual studio 2010 ultimate beta worth downloading
[3:52] <Firetempest> i don't think my score is working. 5.9 for every one.
[3:52] <Konogan|AFK> I'm not overclocking.
[3:52] <Konogan|AFK> What's your vid ram?
[3:52] <Quatroking> aren't all cards underclocked when running idle

[3:53] <TestDummy> My computer will speed up and down its fans with load because of that.
[3:53] <Malikat> it's called power saving
[3:53] <Konogan|AFK> Same :P
[3:53] <TestDummy> The extra heat generated by clocking them up, rather.
[3:53] <Konogan|AFK> That's strange Dommys...
[3:53] <Jake> hmmm
[3:53] <Dommys> HD4870

[5:16] <Shadaez> Yeah, they're getting more.
[5:16] <Vicrry> Best time travel evar: Darkest of Days. Shoot some people? SURE!! Shoot the wrong people? Oops, shoot some other wrong people to balance it out. Just be sure to do more random face shooting. :)
[5:16] <Superwafflez> Ah
[5:16] <Shadaez> I'm just pirating it till I can play
[5:16] <Superwafflez> Heh
[5:16] <Shadaez> Kinda pirating?
[5:16] <Superwafflez> Im pretty sure all they do is sit there with a key generator and add them to their system.
[5:16] <KodaichiZero> furute servers will have a /grief command
[5:16] <Azathoth> steam probably gets a certain number of keys to distribute
[5:16] <KodaichiZero> it takesrandomly sized chunks out of random buildings
[5:17] <Shadaez> steam ran out, the company needs to give them more
[5:17] <MarkTraceur> Okay you noob, what did I miss
[5:17] <Azathoth> they can't just generate keys at will
[5:17] <Superwafflez> I meant the company
[5:17] <Superwafflez> they can generate keys all they like
[5:17] <KodaichiZero> and when OPs try to type /ban, they just ban themselves.
[5:17] <Azathoth> yeah, but it's up to them to sell them to steam or whatever
[5:17] <KodaichiZero> adminium blocks can be walked through
[5:17] <Superwafflez> never said it wansnt up to them
[5:17] <Azathoth> wat
[5:18] <KodaichiZero> pressing h makes blocks semi-transparent
[5:18] <Shadaez> they could probably patch in more keys
[5:18] <Azathoth> yea
[5:18] <Azathoth> i'm sure they're working on it
[5:18] <KodaichiZero> and typing /ragequit makes the server crash for everyone connected

[8:36] <Visiiri> Do iguanas have two penises?
[8:36] <Visiiri> Doctors have studied this for many years and have come up with an answer. Iguana's actually 3 penises and one is actually the size of an average mans penis.
[8:36] <Visiiri> Hollly shit.
[8:36] <Visiiri> THREE PENISES

[8:38] <Koala> i haz 2 dicks
[8:38] <Jackal> agh i want to save but i dont want my furnace to glitch =[
[8:39] <fenixfurion> play indev then
[8:39] <Jackal> saving while its burning makes you crash when you try to open it
[8:39] <fenixfurion> wait
[8:39] <Jackal> or atleast when i try
[8:39] <fenixfurion> it crashes indev?
[8:39] <Jackal> yes
[8:39] <fenixfurion> or infdev
[8:39] <fenixfurion> oshi
[8:40] <Jackal> unless you can somehow flood your base in infdev then its definitely indev
[8:40] <Jackal> since i MUST have flowing water =]
[8:40] <Visiiri> My internet just shat itself
[8:40] <SeanV> saving with stuff in your furnace glitches infdev?
[8:40] <Visiiri> epic lag
[8:40] <Chibiace> odd glitch.
[8:40] <Jackal> not sure infdev but it does indev
[8:40] <SeanV> what happens in indev?
[8:40] <Jackal> it makes minecraft completely fail
[8:41] <Jackal> and go black =p
[8:41] <Jake> jackal: it's not flowing, but you can give yourself water squares and place them in infdev using the saves hacker
[8:41] <Visiiri> Hemipenes (singular = hemipenis) - A male iguana's copulatory organs. Males do not have a single penis, but rather two hemipenes, that deliver sperm to the female's body during copulation.
[8:41] <SeanV> oh snap
[8:41] <Jackal> =[
[8:41] <Visiiri> hawwwt
[8:41] <Chibiace> say you have a square, 2 by 2, one block is water, 2 blocks is ground, and one is air,, you can "Swim" by pressing up against the corner of the two ground blocks.
[8:41] <Jackal> hmm....
[8:41] <Jackal> crops cant grow
[8:41] <Jackal> not interested =p
[8:41] <Jake> crops are bloody useless
[8:42] <Jackal> plus i cant flood out the cavern im trying to enter =p
[8:42] <Jake> cooked meat stacks, is easier to make and restores more health
[8:42] <Visiiri> :( Infdev hacks have been released.
[8:42] <Visiiri> Isn't it sad?
[8:42] <Jackal> na shroom stew is much better =p

[8:42] <Jackal> ugh....

[8:47] <Wervyn> Classic IRC log.
[8:47] <outsomnia> so I just tabbed to this chat and wat, infdev hacks are out?
[8:47] <Jake> is there ever any water in inland maps on indev?
[8:47] <Dommys> And, my favorite F5 to spawn a magic block. Then you scroll to pick it, and it locks.
[8:47] <Wervyn> http://www.bash.org/?244321
[8:47] <Dommys> Explain dis?
[8:47] <Wervyn> There it is.
[8:47] <outsomnia> or are we just speculating as usual?

[8:48] <Koala> wow... Laid to Rest is actually pretty good in BH
[8:48] <Chibiace> hey jake, I've seen a bit of water every now and then, but I don't think it's flowing water.
[8:48] <SeanV> hey, where to get this infdev hack?
[8:48] <Jake> found some, and it's flowing
[8:49] <Visiiri> SeanV: Yeah right.
[8:49] <Jake> excellent, time to make a huge inland lake
[8:49] <SeanV> water is rare in inland maps but it works fine
[8:49] <Jackal> sadly its not a large amount on inland, aka you can run out
[8:49] <redk95> does anyone know where I can get a dat file that looks like an island? I found some in maps and modding but every-time i tried to use them it saids unable to find class
[8:49] <redk95> ughh
[8:50] <Jake> urgh, bugger
[8:50] <Shori> Most badass maps/modding = the tree one
[8:50] <Chibiace> Hmm, I think I can work with this infdev map
[8:50] <Jake> inland water...it's the kind that if you dig near it, it all drains away
[8:50] <Visiiri> Redshift has the infdev hack.
[8:50] <Chibiace> save for...the lack of gravel in a general area.

[8:53] <SeanV> yeah that video was pretty cool

[8:58] <Wervyn> What, like every other flatland server?
[8:58] <Jat> a flatland server is totally doable
[8:58] <Jat> no
[8:58] <Jat> i mean a real flatland server
[8:59] <Jat> as in 2 dimensional... but to do it properly would require custom server software
[8:59] <Wervyn> As in the Edward A Abbott book Flatland server?

[11:09] <Shori> Demoman isn't underpowered, vurtual
[11:09] <Shori> it's only 'underpowered' when people are bad
[11:09] <vurtual> he used to be, in the eyes of everyone
[11:09] <Shori> at it
[11:09] <vurtual> I'm entirely content with being a hardcore destroyer class
[11:09] <vurtual> with my eyelander and grenades.
[11:09] <Shori> He's not even that easy to kill, though
[11:10] <Shori> Switchy and I used to shred maps on demo
[11:10] <vurtual> I nerfed my hp with the eyelander for everybody

[11:10] <Griskard> Eh?
[11:11] <Shori> Pyros are kinda annoying

[20:58] <Eagle> I see.
[20:58] <Eagle> Alright.
[20:58] <Visiiri> It doesn't have hacks and you still have to be premium.
[20:58] <Jake> so...how does it differ from indev itself?
[20:59] <Eagle> Visiiri, send it over.
[20:59] <Eagle> :O
[20:59] <Visiiri> Jake: Just that it's not in-browser.
[20:59] <Visiiri> And it's got an installer.

[21:31] <Visiiri> I'm excited because I just sent an email to Notch about releasing a standalone indev client.
[21:31] <LG_Legacy> Lol?
[21:31] <Visiiri> Exciting, rite?
[21:31] <vede> Visiiri, everyone already knows what his answer will be.

[21:32] <Visiiri> Oh, know, I mean releasing a client I put together.
[21:32] <Visiiri> erm, "no" not "know"

[21:35] <whatdoesth> It's also the scheme Notch is using for now, however.
[21:35] <Visiiri> :)
[21:35] <vede> whatdoesth, not as DRM, though.
[21:35] <whatdoesth> Yes, as DRM.
[21:36] <vede> You think he has it in a web page to combat piracy?
[21:36] * Visiiri feels stupid and doesn't know what a DRM is...
[21:36] <whatdoesth> I think you have to be logged in to start the game.
[21:36] <Visiiri> Anyways, that's not the point.
[21:36] <vede> whatdoesth, yeah, that's just a side effect of the current distribution method.
[21:37] <Visiiri> It's exactly the same as /indev/ only it doesn't need a web browser.
[21:37] <whatdoesth> I'm assuming it will (read: it had better) be removed once beta/final is reached, but for now, it is in fact DRM.
[21:38] <whatdoesth> Even if it is only incidental, for now that is how it is.
[21:38] <vede> whatdoesth, just because it has the same effect as DRM, that doesn't make it DRM.
[21:38] <Visiiri> wtf is a DRM
[21:38] <vede> "DRM" requires the intent to protect rights to intellectual property.
[21:38] <vede> DRM, guggle dat shit
[21:38] <vede> ...
[21:38] <vede> *Visiiri, guggle dat shit
[21:38] <Visiiri> ugh
[21:38] <Visiiri> Google it you twat
[21:39] <vede> I'll give you the acronym: Digital Rights Management
[21:39] <Visiiri> Yup
[21:39] <whatdoesth> Actually, it's just the intent to *control* the end user's usage of a piece of software.
[21:39] <vede> whatdoesth, so, according to you, the purpose has nothing to do with the name?
[21:39] <whatdoesth> Yes, actually, have you never heard of doublespeak?
[21:40] <Dommys> The benefit of running out of the browser
[21:40] <Visiiri> Well, I am choosing to not get involved in the webzfight I started.
[21:40] <Dommys> Is resizing the game window Besides "normal" and "FULLSCREEN"
[21:40] <Visiiri> Instead, I'll play L4D2
[21:40] <vede> Dommys, you can do that anyway.
[21:40] <vede> CTRL+scroll
[21:40] <Dommys> Please explain
[21:40] * Visiiri is now known as Vis{L4D2}
[21:40] <Vis{L4D2}> Yes, zooming in and out does this.
[21:40] <Vis{L4D2}> But anyways, still not the point.
[21:40] <Vis{L4D2}> It doesn't differ from minecraft.net/indev/
[21:40] <Dommys> Not like I want
[21:41] <GoaLitiuM> your face when you discover, that notch was the one who made breaking the tower: :OO
[21:41] <Vis{L4D2}> except you do not acces it froma web browser.
[21:41] <vede> GoaLitiuM, we already knew that.
[21:41] <GoaLitiuM> but i didn't
[21:41] <Vis{L4D2}> Alrighty, bai.

[21:42] <Marach-14> maybe it's lg
[21:43] <vede> Yelling at Dommys' family: also funtimes.
[21:43] <vurtual> Hm, why exactly does fighting off cold via shared body heat require being naked?
[21:43] <vurtual> How can T-Shirt stop you from being warm?
[21:43] <Dommys> :D
[21:43] <vede> So now we have double funtimes going on.

[21:43] <vede> vurtual, it doesn't.
[21:44] <vede> It's just a trick in narrative to try to make the situation seem more awkward than it is.
[21:44] <Yourself> what is?
[21:44] <vurtual> hmmmm
[21:44] <vurtual> then again this is generally in a situation where you'd have inherently heavy clothes
[21:44] <vede> "Guys huddling around to keep warm? Meh. Make them naked too. THEN it's fucking awkward."
[21:44] <vurtual> and getting hugged through a winter coat isn't going to do much
[21:45] <Jake> aaargh, the sun is setting and my foor isn't finished
[21:45] <Yourself> clothing would lower the thermal conductivity compared to direct contact
[21:45] <vurtual> And then there's the real life threat of freezing water
[21:45] <Yourself> put your hand on your stomach with a shirt and then put it directly on your skin, which feels warmer?
[21:45] <vede> Yourself, but then the clothes also... help you keep warm.
[21:45] <vurtual> The other option: Freezing your clothes via rolling in snow, which freezes your clothes, and that's nto very fun.
[21:45] <vurtual> and keep you cold
[21:45] <Yourself> yes, the reason they keep you warm is because they lower thermal conductivity and trap a layer of air
[21:45] <vurtual> you can make ice cream using that physics.
[21:46] <Yourself> they let less of your own body heat escape
[21:46] <Dommys> You can make ice cream using all kinds of physics.
[21:46] <vede> Yourself, if I had to choose between huddling around naked and huddling around with an extra warming layer of clothing, I'd choose the latter.
[21:46] <vurtual> which is counter-productive to sharing it
[21:46] <vurtual> vede, then you die
[21:46] <vurtual> besides what if it's a hot chick?

[21:46] <vurtual> Would you rather prefer if it were like brokeback mountain?
[21:46] <Dommys> That sounds the sexiest.
[21:46] <vurtual> Without a shirt feels colder, but then again, my hands are comparitively ice cold to my body
[21:46] <Dommys> I mean, safest.
[21:47] <vurtual> and at the same time, my hands are very hot to everyone else

[22:08] <vede> EmpiresBane, but it's only sexist in the same way that, say, heterosexuality is sexist.
[22:08] <Cheeseyx> They act like women are the master gender or something

[22:13] <Quatroking> how about GO TO FUCKING SCHOOL

[22:16] <Cheeseyx> Yeah
[22:16] <TrueWolves> then we can have lakes ontop of cliffs with cool water streaming down
[22:16] <Cheeseyx> TrueWolves, it will most likely allow waterfalls

[23:53] <blaster> Guess who has been doing industrial scale ore searching? http://i40.tinypic.com/24ozqmb.png
[23:54] <shroomer> but, how?
[23:54] <shroomer> wth is a torrent?
[23:54] <blaster> Drop gravel above you
[23:54] <blaster> so that it lands on you
[23:54] <blaster> Its a picture
[23:54] <Quatroking> shroomer you don't know what a torrent it?
[23:54] <blaster> A torrent is a virus
[23:54] <shroomer> i never looked into it.
[23:54] <Quatroking> how long are you on the internet
[23:55] <shroomer> hardly
[23:55] <blaster> I cannot you torrents because they only go at 10kb a second
[23:55] <blaster> Faster to do regular downloads running at 200kb a second
[23:55] <Quatroking> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29
[23:55] <Quatroking> it all depends on what you want
[23:55] <Quatroking> download a linux iso is a lot faster when you use torrents
[23:55] * whatdoesth (whatdoesth@pool-72-65-222-59.pitbpa.east.verizon.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[23:55] <Quatroking> downloading*
[23:56] <shroomer> cuz since i have mac and i cant have cheat engine so i can only use ihax which i can only find the torrent for
[23:56] <blaster> I also have to portforward every time I wana use
[23:56] <blaster> Its just awkard
[23:56] <shroomer> nvm i hate torrents
[23:56] <blaster> And my share ratio is terrible and I cannot work out how to improve it easy
[23:56] <Quatroking> share ratio often only matters on private trackers
[23:57] <blaster> Is azures vuze a private tracker?
[23:57] <Quatroking> also this chips tastes like shit
[23:57] <Quatroking> blaster thats a client
[23:57] <blaster> ooooh
[23:57] <Quatroking> a tracker is something like Demonoid, The Piratebay
[23:57] <Quatroking> the servers that keep track of the torrents
[23:57] <Quatroking> they help people connect with each other
[23:58] <shroomer> i hate torrents
[23:58] <blaster> Same
[23:58] <Quatroking> a moment ago you didn't even know what they were
[23:58] <blaster> Why can't people just make normal downloads?
[23:58] <blaster> Its far easier
[23:59] <Quatroking> blaster, because a normal download requires someone to keep online all the time
[23:59] <Quatroking> torrents allow people to download from each other
[23:59] <TestDummy> It's easier to share the load against a group of people than having a server handle it.
[23:59] <Quatroking> for example, person A already has part one two and three
[23:59] <blaster> I know how they work
[23:59] <shroomer> i wanted to know until i heard "port forwarding"
[23:59] <blaster> But its too slow
[23:59] <TestDummy> Bandwidth isn't cheap.
[23:59] <shroomer> and i hate port forwarding
[23:59] <Quatroking> blaster the speed depends on the torrent
[23:59] <blaster> OK thats it
[23:59] <blaster> We need to set up more underwater cables
[23:59] <Quatroking> torrents with shit seeders are slow for example
[23:59] <Visiiri> blaster: Give people money for torrent servers
