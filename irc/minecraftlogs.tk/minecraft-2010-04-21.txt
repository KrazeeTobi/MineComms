[0:00] <bildramer> what if the LHC just smashes atoms together? :|
[0:00] <TerraSleet> what if the LHC cums pure bosons
[0:00] <bildramer> not even atoms
[0:00] * thechris (Mibbit@65.29.110.3) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:00] <bildramer> found the Higgs boson yet
[0:00] <bildramer> ?
[0:00] <Brett> not yet
[0:00] * Rijjka (IceChat7@gdprtnt1-port-85.dial.telus.net) has left #minecraft
[0:00] <bildramer> keep searching
[0:00] <TrueWolves> ._.
[0:00] <bildramer> it's prolly hiding
[0:00] <TrueWolves> I'm a huge nerd if I find the first to paragraphs of this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_interaction_of_antimatter funny. x.x;
[0:00] <bildramer> or not existing
[0:01] * Ookami (ookami@host86-170-210-48.range86-170.btcentralplus.com) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
[0:01] <Yourself> also, bildramer, we don't actually know if antineutrinos aren't als just neutrinos
[0:01] <Yourself> also*
[0:01] <bildramer> ;_;
[0:02] <bildramer> damn science not being faster at hard discoveries
[0:02] <Brett> "consensus in science is but hypothesis open to falsification" should link to scientific method
[0:02] <revenant> hey Brett
[0:02] <revenant> I have a project for you :)
[0:02] <Brett> yo
[0:02] <revenant> make an HTML Canvas based WebGL minecraft client.
[0:02] <Yourself> well there's no real way to tell
[0:02] <Brett> what's up?
[0:02] <revenant> Have you played with WebGL yet?
[0:02] <Brett> no i haven't
[0:02] <Yourself> since neutrinos have no electrical charge, they're probably the same particle
[0:02] <bildramer> and with that rate, we'll be able to simulate our universe in itself
[0:02] <revenant> it's like OpenGL ES... except it runs in HTML5 canvas.
[0:02] <bildramer> so it will crash
[0:02] <revenant> and it's hardware accelerated.
[0:02] <Yourself> since what distinguishes matter from antimatter is charge
[0:03] <revenant> lemme show you some examples
[0:03] <revenant> (you have to enable it in Safari/firefox)
[0:03] <Yourself> <bildramer> and with that rate, we'll be able to simulate our universe in itself
[0:03] <bildramer> we really need negative mass matter
[0:03] <Brett> alright
[0:03] <revenant> http://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Demo_Repository Brett
[0:03] <bildramer> where are the universe settings?
[0:03] <Yourself> that's definitely impossible
[0:03] <bildramer> >_>
[0:03] <Yourself> well if you had a simulation of the universe, that simulation would naturally have a simulation of itself
[0:03] <revenant> bildramer
[0:03] <bildramer> that's why it would crash
[0:03] <revenant> in ObjC...
[0:04] <bildramer> or can't exist
[0:04] <bildramer> but heck, we can't even simulate anything yet
[0:04] <Yourself> oh, thought you were talking about something else when you said that
[0:04] <bildramer> not even 3-4 atoms or something
[0:04] <TrueWolves> antimater is emo. =/
[0:04] <revenant> [universe setHotdogsPerQuarticParsec:]
[0:04] <Yourself> bildramer, yes we can
[0:04] <bildramer> not really
[0:04] <TrueWolves> All it ever does in the end is analaiate it's self.
[0:04] <revenant> no we can't Yourself.
[0:04] <Brett> revenant: you make me really want to learn objc
[0:04] <Yourself> the post-doc i work with does this
[0:04] <revenant> Brett
[0:04] <revenant> it has nothing to do with ObjC
[0:04] * Earfolds (ookami@host86-170-210-48.range86-170.btcentralplus.com) has joined #minecraft
[0:04] <Brett> no
[0:04] <Brett> but
[0:04] <TrueWolves> annihilate*
[0:04] <revenant> It's a Javascript/C spec I believe.
[0:05] <bildramer> what
[0:05] <Brett> all the talk you do of it
[0:05] <revenant> That was unrelated XD
[0:05] <bildramer> explain
[0:05] <revenant> I'm working in it right now lol.
[0:05] <Brett> has convinced me to learn it
[0:05] <revenant> wait really XD?
[0:05] <bildramer> and what's a post-doc
[0:05] <revenant> rofl
[0:05] <Brett> yeah
[0:05] <revenant> post-doctorate.
[0:05] <bildramer> ol
[0:05] <bildramer> p;p
[0:05] <bildramer> lol
[0:05] <bildramer> :|
[0:05] <Yourself> it means he has a PhD and works as an academic researcher
[0:05] <Yourself> but is decidedly less respected than a professor
[0:05] <bildramer> coooool.

[1:01] <Naxza> Get them to start a forest fire and then make them try to stop it.
[1:01] <Zaneo> i set fire to a forest once...

[1:02] <Lukisod> yeah, fire needs careful application in infdev
[1:02] <Ten_Tacles> Fire should be buffed.
[1:02] <bildramer> I'll listen to some Ikaruga music again, then read a book until it's 01:00, then sleep, then remember that my alarm clock is set to ring at 03:30 after it wakes me up, then sleep again, then wake up at 05:55, then sleep again, then be almost late to school, then watch one hour of retards trying to understand maths, then play some cards, then take a walk and then finally write that exam
[1:03] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[1:03] <JTE> When there's an out of control forest fire in Minecraft, I usually just try to cut it off by quickly harvesting the uppermost part of the trunks before the fire gets there, so that not only will my inventory be full of useful wood, but the fire leaves behind a whole bunch of stumps for me later.
[1:03] <bildramer> ;_;
[1:03] <CruelNoise> i like your lifestile, bild
[1:03] <CruelNoise> lifestyle*
[1:03] <CruelNoise> can i have it?
[1:03] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[1:03] <Zaneo> Dynamite works great, create a fire break
[1:03] <bildramer> JTE: best way to control a forest fire is to burn the trees that are ahead
[1:03] <Lukisod> why wake up at 330 and 555?
[1:03] <bildramer> if there's nothing to burn, it won't
[1:03] <bildramer> lolololololololol

[1:05] <Zaneo> Wake up, go to school, sleep, eat lunch, do computer engineering, go home minecraft, sleep...
[1:05] <bildramer> I'll now spend some time trying to figure out how to use complex numbers in that calculator and then sleep
[1:05] <vurtual> HMMM
[1:05] <vurtual> I have to find the 30th button on my controller
[1:05] <bildramer> it sucks that except from the exam I'll just sit around there

[1:09] <vurtual> Cannot find 24-30, if they exist
[1:09] <gear2> at least at my highschool, 12th grade programming was bullshit
[1:09] <bildramer> Java UUUUGGGGHHHHH
[1:09] <Zaneo> what language gear?
[1:09] <TrueWolves> ...?
[1:09] <TrueWolves> x.o
[1:09] <gear2> any
[1:09] <TrueWolves> DF crashed and I have NO clue why.
[1:09] <vurtual> I remember when someone started messing with the extra hat switch on my joystick
[1:09] <gear2> they switched to java my junior and senior year
[1:09] <bildramer> I'm surprised that my sister can only see that the computer is on when the screen is on

[1:09] <bildramer> *facepalm*
[1:09] <Zaneo> I'm learning C# right now

[1:10] <bildramer> good night
[1:10] <gear2> but it was hurrdurr java
[1:10] <bildramer> <3 C++
[1:10] <CruelNoise> on one of my computers, DF would cause it to bluescreen
[1:10] <Zaneo> I used some no name, non object oriented language before, so it's messing me up
[1:10] <gear2> lol
[1:10] <TkTech> gear2: All highschool programming courses (and usually engineering) are jokes
[1:10] <gear2> agreed
[1:10] <TkTech> Its a fairly universal thing
[1:11] <TrueWolves> Great, that sets me back nearly 3 months. ._.;
[1:11] <Zaneo> My cisco class is a joke
[1:11] <CruelNoise> guess what the grade 11 course at my highschool is?

[1:12] <CruelNoise> at the other school in the city, at least they get Actionscript.
[1:12] <Zaneo> My school messed up their c++ compilers so they switched to c# for senior year
[1:12] <Lukisod> I did actionscript

[2:50] <TrueWolves> blaster, google it
[2:50] <blaster> I tried
[2:50] <TrueWolves> I found out by google. =/
[2:50] <blaster> Internet does not know much unless I am searching
[2:50] <blaster> What dod you search?
[2:50] <Legolord> Gah, I checked everywhere
[2:50] <TrueWolves> "Reasons for BSOD" or something.
[2:50] <TrueWolves> Lego, it's likely hidden under something like a grass block.
[2:51] <TrueWolves> Minecraft seemed like a completely diffrent (Awesome still) game before multiplayer...
[2:51] <blaster> No thats now quite what I mean
[2:51] <TrueWolves> But it is what you mean
[2:51] <blaster> why would new software cause it to run unsafely
[2:51] <TrueWolves> your asking what is "not operating safely"
[2:51] <blaster> unless the software is attempting to delete system files
[2:51] <Yourself> "According to Microsoft, bluescreens on NT-based Windows systems are usually caused by poorly-written device drivers or malfunctioning hardware."

[2:53] <Vgor> Not necesarrily
[2:53] <blaster> Or cannot recover and needs to restart
[2:53] <TrueWolves> blaster
[2:53] <TrueWolves> Just...
[2:53] <TrueWolves> just do the google search I suggested. =/
[2:53] <blaster> I did
[2:53] <Vgor> A blue screen can be caused by missing files or bad ram
[2:53] <Vgor> Or bad drivers
[2:53] <CrazySpai> I love how people can't google.
[2:53] <TrueWolves> It can be caused by an over-heat of the hardware as well
[2:53] <Cial> i wish Norton would do something about this virus in my sys 32 folder
[2:53] <Vgor> Or a damaged Leicester of hardware
[2:53] <Yourself> or a shitty PSU

[3:40] <Zaneo> Ah
[3:40] <Zaneo> stupid chatzilla?
[3:40] <blaster> Anyone here use clicksandwhistles?
[3:41] <TrueWolves> I think chatzilla lets you somehow.
[3:41] <TrueWolves> Not sure how though.

[3:42] <Dysgalt> to all ye wondering aidans rp is back..
[3:43] <blaster> my Rp was better
[3:43] <blaster> Dysgalt did you play it
[3:43] <Dysgalt> No
[3:43] <Dysgalt> I'm just temp hosting
[3:43] <blaster> Oh, It was fun, we had 2 main citys and 2 smaller towns
[3:43] <blaster> the 2 main citys were at war
[3:44] <blaster> when the other city logged out we raided them using nukes
[3:44] <blaster> and flooded their mines with lava
[3:44] <blaster> The game was 10X slower pased than indev and had 5 tiers of stuff
[3:44] <blaster> but other than that it was quite close to playing multiplayer survival
[3:44] <TrueWolves> ... so?
[3:45] <TheClassiestMedic> which RP is this
[3:46] <]Visiiri> Mass Effect 2 > Any possible RP that isn't Mass Effect 2.
[3:46] <]Visiiri> It's so very dynamic.
[3:46] <TrueWolves> That's an RPG
[3:47] <Lukisod> heavy ra5n+
[3:47] <TrueWolves> not /quite/ the same topic.
[3:47] <]Visiiri> wut
[3:47] <Lukisod> heavy ra5n...
[3:47] <Lukisod> da0n 5t...
[3:47] <]Visiiri> Role Playing ->
[3:47] <Lukisod> bah
[3:47] <Zaneo> yeah mass effect is one of those in between games
[3:47] <]Visiiri> Does it not translate directly into a game?
[3:47] <]Visiiri> I mean, certainly you have your communication tree
[3:47] <]Visiiri> And, depending on the things you say and do, the plot will change dramatically.
[3:47] <Lukisod> not overly
[3:47] <TrueWolves> That's not what I meant
[3:48] <blaster> Wana know the best RP
[3:48] <]Visiiri> I'm confused,
[3:48] <Lukisod> you\re still pretty much on a liner path to the end
[3:48] <]Visiiri> Is there a way around that?
[3:48] <Lukisod> just makes you feel better in the end about you're choices
[3:48] <blaster> D&D, because it does not have set programming, you could ram a fork into someones head (It would not be very effective but you get the idea)
[3:48] <Lukisod> which is what I play
[3:48] <]Visiiri> You're not inclined to honor the mission that Cerberus
[3:48] <TrueWolves> usualy an RPG is a game that has roleplay inharet to it with a game system attached, where RP is just the roleplay.
[3:48] <]Visiiri> gave you
[3:48] <Malikat> it could be effective
[3:48] <Malikat> as a shock tactic
[3:49] <TrueWolves> That's how I diffrienate anyway
[3:49] <]Visiiri> Events are triggered by your actions
[3:49] <Malikat> roleplay is an action
[3:49] <blaster> Anyone think TNT shotguns will be used in survival multiplayer?
[3:49] <]Visiiri> Shut the fuck up, Malikat.
[3:49] <Malikat> a role playing game is a noun
[3:49] <Lukisod> basically, you're given two choices in ME2, do it, or sit there impotently mining planets
[3:49] <Malikat> what the hell visiiri
[3:49] <Malikat> what did i do to you
[3:49] <]Visiiri> Lukisod: Assignments?
[3:50] <]Visiiri> Oh, nothing.
[3:50] <]Visiiri> It's just, we were talking

[3:50] <]Visiiri> and you come in with an objection.
[3:50] <]Visiiri> TrueWolves explained it just fine.
[3:50] <Lukisod> meh
[3:50] <Lukisod> I'm really arguing over nothing :)
[3:50] <Malikat> i was disagreeing, since when is that so wrong?
[3:50] <Miclee> ME2 is epic win game.
[3:50] <Lukisod> it is
[3:50] * ]Visiiri is now known as Vis{AFK}
[3:50] <Vis{AFK}> Yesh
[3:50] <Vis{AFK}> bai
[3:50] <Lukisod> I just say it doesnt qualify as an RPG
[3:51] <Miclee> It's a RPG, not so much as ME1.
[3:51] <Miclee> It's more of a TPS.
[3:51] <Malikat> Lukisod: i think you mean that it's more linear than you'd like?
[3:51] <Lukisod> well, no more than say... unreal you play the role of a guy fighting in an arena
[3:51] <Lukisod> it is more liniar than I'd like
[3:51] <Zaneo> It's like Guildwars, not quite an rpg
[3:51] <Lukisod> thank you for putting that into words...
[3:51] <Miclee> It's not very linear.
[3:51] <Miclee> When you think of the series, it's not linear.
[3:51] <Miclee> If you're isolating ME2, it's linear.
[3:51] <TrueWolves> >.>;;
[3:52] <TrueWolves> Well
[3:52] <TrueWolves> I gave my interperation of the diffrent of RP and RPG

[4:11] <Kokopure> past*

[4:12] <Vicrry> Craft bread with cooked pork - SAMMITCH! (Maybe it stack? :P)
[4:12] <Siddharta> walp
[4:12] <Malikat> pork chop sandwichs!
[4:12] <Malikat> es*
[4:12] <Siddharta> halfway finished with my EO2 gunner skin
[4:12] <Zaneo> yeah stacking food needs to be added
[4:12] <Malikat> food should never stack
[4:12] <Malikat> except in chests.
[4:12] <Kokopure> you know, see
[4:12] <Siddharta> Malikat
[4:12] <Kokopure> I used to be for stacking food in inventory
[4:12] <Siddharta> Ever heard of pancakes?
[4:12] <Kokopure> but now I think it's good that there aren't any.
[4:12] <Zaneo> i think i can stack 2 sammiches
[4:12] * Siddharta is now known as outsomnia|Clinton
[4:12] <Malikat> okay pancakes should stack
[4:13] <Kokopure> agreed.
[4:13] <Malikat> clinton i like the way you think
[4:13] <outsomnia|Clinton> Hypothetically, you could stack bread.
[4:13] <Malikat> notch should introduce pancakes as a stackable food
[4:13] <Vicrry> Non-stacking food is a kinda balance thing. cause I shouldn't has 200 health bars in my inventory
[4:13] <Kokopure> but yeah, food should stack in chests but not in inventory.
[4:13] <Malikat> that heals one heart each
[4:13] <Zaneo> meat used to be stackable
[4:13] <outsomnia|Clinton> Though it';s always too puffy/squishy/etc. to stack without
[4:13] <Zaneo> if you cooked it
[4:13] <Malikat> or half a heart each
[4:13] <outsomnia|Clinton> them bouncing/falling off of each other.
[4:13] <Zaneo> then didn't take it out of furnace
[4:13] <Kokopure> crepes should be half a heart each.
[4:13] <Kokopure> Minecraft: Kitchencraft update
[4:13] <outsomnia|Clinton> Deli meats are definitely stackable/
[4:14] <outsomnia|Clinton> WHARS MAH GAWDAMN SAMMICH NAWTCH?
[4:14] <Kokopure> I actually would be pretty cool with a kitchen update.
[4:14] <outsomnia|Clinton> omgplsdunkikmiiwuzjustjk
[4:14] <Lukisod> I think if you stack bread and deli meats you should get sandwich
[4:14] <Kokopure> I think it should be a craftable thing.
[4:14] <Kokopure> bread ham bread = sammich.
[4:15] <Kokopure> or, well
[4:15] <Kokopure> maybe after crafting a bread from three grains
[4:15] <Kokopure> the same way you can craft a block of ore back into the ores
[4:15] <Kokopure> you should be able to craft a whole bread into, like, two or four slices?

[4:15] <outsomnia|Clinton> There've been a couple Zaku skins but
[4:15] <Kokopure> haha, vurtual
[4:15] <Lukisod> bread should be in the middle

[4:20] <outsomnia|Clinton> By god this has some epic potential here, kid.
[4:21] <Darke> Hah. Yeah it has to have some historical facts or what not
[4:21] <outsomnia|Clinton> Is it world history or what country/province's history and what time period?
[4:21] <Lukisod> use facts that have nothing to do with the story

[4:25] <Lukisod> steal somehting off the net, then use the thesaurus to change every significant word
[4:25] <TheClassiestMedic> like stakes

[4:25] <NoBalls> Eh
[4:25] <Darke> okay.
[4:25] <Kokopure> he was a typical
[4:25] <Darke> Hm
[4:25] <outsomnia|Clinton> BR?
[4:25] <Darke> He was a average
[4:25] <TheClassiestMedic> nom?

[4:26] <Darke> Hm
[4:26] <Kokopure> SO
[4:26] <outsomnia|Clinton> [17:25] <Darke> He was a average
[4:26] <Kokopure> you keep hearing about people wanting to craft gold into coins.
[4:26] <NoBalls> I was here often, like a usual, or a regular
[4:26] <Kokopure> what about iron and diamond coins :3?
[4:26] <outsomnia|Clinton> Something tells me you should just hire someone to write the paper for you.
[4:26] <Kokopure> I think that could actually be more useful.
[4:26] <NoBalls> No diamond coins
[4:26] <TheClassiestMedic> wtf
[4:26] <Kokopure> whyyyyy
[4:26] <Konogan> He was an average everyday normal guy.
[4:26] <TheClassiestMedic> penis skin
[4:26] <Darke> outsomnia|Clinton, no see it was intentional.
[4:26] <NoBalls> You can't forge them back
[4:26] <Kokopure> what?
[4:26] <Vicrry> So, why make coins? Not like we can trade yet :P

[4:26] <NoBalls> They lose their value if you can't reforge them D:

[4:27] <Darke> I'm probably one of the best writers in the school I just fucking hate writing anything about history.
[4:27] <Darke> It imposes a limit.
[4:27] <Kokopure> if one diamond block = 9 diamond slabs
[4:27] <Kokopure> and one diamond slab = 9 diamond coins
[4:27] <NoBalls> :l
[4:27] <Darke> And I can't do a war story, because thats violence >.>
[4:27] <Kokopure> that's 81 diamond coins per diamond block. yes?
[4:27] <NoBalls> No
[4:27] <outsomnia|Clinton> Darke, it involves fiction.

[5:20] * Varriount_ is now known as Vgor
[5:20] <Kokopure> Konogan, I may actually buy the game for one of my friends.
[5:20] <Kokopure> actually, question.
[5:20] <Kokopure> when MP hits
[5:20] <NoBalls> IT IS AN IRC ROLE PLAY
[5:20] <Kokopure> it'll still be Alpha, right?
[5:20] <NoBalls> With cow

[5:29] <Kokopure> what's your opinion on Steak
[5:29] <NoBalls> That iron will be helpful as soon as we get a furnace
[5:29] <Animator> Why protect a cow when I could share all the majority of it's meat with you guys over delicious home-cooked burgers?
[5:29] <Zaneo> Think we will ever get charcoal?
[5:29] <Konogan> Alright, I'll keep it.
[5:29] <Konogan> I got tons.
[5:29] <NoBalls> Hmm
[5:30] <Animator> You can always get another.
[5:30] <Kokopure> I think Steak should heeeal six hearts.
[5:30] * cow thinks Noballs should make swords/armor to fight against Animator
[5:30] <Kokopure> but take twice as long to cook.
[5:30] * Vgor puts an invisibility cloak on the cow
[5:30] <Kokopure> does that sound balanced?
[5:30] <NoBalls> We need some wood or something if we want to smelt
[5:30] <Animator> For cooking the cow?
[5:30] <Zaneo> i have planks
[5:30] <Konogan> Anyway, BRB

[5:31] * cow cuddles beside NoBalls for safety
[5:31] <Kokopure> I think I like it.
[5:31] <NoBalls> Since when you have a chest?
[5:31] <cow> moo
[5:31] <Animator> Hm. Well NoBalls, I'll have to see your permit to allow this cow on the premisis of this channel.
[5:31] <NoBalls> So, status on how many cobblestone we have
[5:31] <Kokopure> you need a livestock permit D:
[5:31] <NoBalls> No cows for you
[5:32] <NoBalls> And no building near our barn
[5:32] <cow> moo
[5:32] <Animator> Yeah, a livestock permit.
[5:32] <Animator> Do you have a livestock permit?

[5:32] * Vgor shows his permit for the cow
[5:32] <Konogan> BTW, I hope Notch will implement local chat for MP.
[5:32] <Kokopure> if anyone needs help building anything in Creative, just link me the URL to the server and I'll do what I can...
[5:32] * Animator reads permit.
[5:32] <Vgor> MYCOW
[5:32] * NoBalls shows permit
[5:32] <NoBalls> Actually our cow
[5:32] * Animator reads other permit.
[5:32] <Animator> Huh.
[5:33] <Vgor> Wwwhat?
[5:33] * cow wanders around nervously
[5:33] <Animator> Well, apparently, both of your permits are actually the fusion of 1/2 of a real permit, and 1/2 fig leaves.
[5:33] <NoBalls> Erm, guys, do we have enough units of cobblestone?
[5:33] * Vgor pats the cow
[5:33] * NoBalls follows cow
[5:33] <Animator> If NoBalls and Vgor fuse permits, it'd be legitimate.
[5:33] * Vgor fuses the permit
[5:33] * NoBalls ready to fuse
[5:33] <Animator> That which also makes you joint owners of the cow.
[5:33] <NoBalls> I wonder why I got a half-permit...

[5:50] <TheClassiestMedic> Good ?
[5:50] <Animator> Don't ask.
[5:50] <Animator> The channel just had one of it's 'moments'.
[5:50] <TheClassiestMedic> It involves your mother
[5:50] <Animator> As did I.
[5:50] <TheClassiestMedic> Ahem
[5:51] <Animator> That was bad timing and was not aimed at your mother.
[5:51] <Cial> you wouldnt want any part of my mother
[5:51] <AndrewPH> oh yes I would
[5:51] <Animator> I would, but that's another story involving bodily organs and... questionable charities...
[5:51] <Cial> i highly doubt that
[5:52] <Cial> didnt ask you necromancer
[5:52] <Animator> Selling body parts to science isn't necromancing, it's called making a good profit that no one would want to compete with.
[5:53] <AndrewPH> oh yes I would
[5:53] <Animator> Also, Cial, are you interested in your kidney? You only need one to survive! :D
[5:53] <BearClaw89> hmmm
[5:53] <BearClaw89> i could buy it
[5:53] <BearClaw89> or eat it
[5:53] <Cial> well giving up a kidney leaves a horrible scar
[5:54] <Cial> but how much money would i get?
[5:54] <Animator> I can cut you 35% of the profits.
[5:54] <Animator> Kidneys in this economy go for very high.

[6:00] <cow> #cow
[6:00] <TheClassiestMedic> Nou
[6:00] <Konogan> You lack of logic.
[6:00] <TheClassiestMedic> :D windeed
[6:00] <TheClassiestMedic> For example
[6:00] <Kokopure> question, does Notch really not like dragons, or is that a joke?
[6:00] <TheClassiestMedic> The other day in the mall
[6:00] <TheClassiestMedic> I jumped into the fountain and took off my clothes
[6:00] <Animator> I did it.
[6:00] <TheClassiestMedic> and then these people in suits
[6:00] <Animator> And nothing strange is happening.
[6:00] <TheClassiestMedic> took me away to a weird rubber room
[6:00] <TheClassiestMedic> :/
[6:00] <Animator> Just my client seems to have frozen.
[6:01] <Animator> Now it's not unfrozen.
[6:01] <Cial> notch adding dragons is about as likely as me winning the lottery in russia
[6:01] <IceFlinger> When you're rich, can I have some money?
[6:01] <Cial> hold your breath till i win
[6:02] <Animator> I see nothing unusual happening.

[6:20] <EmpiresBane> well, that's why. don't believe the rumors. believe Notch
[6:21] <vurtual> What game was it, that near... the end boss, I think
[6:21] <vurtual> There was a voidy area, some platforms, and then a teleport of some sort
[6:21] <vurtual> Which had like, white parts sticking up, and lots of red.
[6:21] <EmpiresBane> sounds very generic...
[6:21] <outsomnia|Clinton> Halo
[6:21] <Lukisod> doom 2
[6:21] <Lukisod> ?
[6:22] <vurtual> It was 3D, although it could have been referring to another shooter
[6:22] <vurtual> had sorta... 90s era graphics, might'vej ust been a sven coop map
[6:22] <EmpiresBane> Every Game Ever Made: Even More Genericer?
[6:24] <Lukisod> not portal
[6:24] <vurtual> It was distinct small platforms of... stone, and then a mildly bigger platform which was in the distance, and then sorta bone-white stalks, with red flesh between, and that teleported you, and itw as near a boss.

[6:40] <vurtual> also guys, what if the combines capture Gordon and try to combine-ify him?
[6:40] <Konogan> Yay! new lost episodes!
[6:40] <FakeSky> Then he would be Combine.
[6:41] <FakeSky> And he would remember nothing of his past life.
[6:41] <Vis{AFK}> Yer muM!
[6:41] * Vis{AFK} is now known as Visiiri
[6:41] <LG_Legacy> Yawn
[6:41] <vurtual> but if it were like quake 4
[6:41] <Visiiri> Or ME2
[6:41] <vurtual> and he just becomes some sort of robot-ified guy
[6:41] <Visiiri> Nope
[6:41] <Visiiri> Me2 people get melte

[6:41] <Espiodude2|Sexy> :D
[6:42] <Espiodude2|Sexy> So... What about Gordon Freeman? :o
[6:42] <Visiiri> He should die
[6:42] <vurtual> so yeah if Gordon was partially cybernetically enhanced

[6:43] <Visiiri> Btw
[6:43] <Espiodude2|Sexy> I'm not staff, but I like to look at those, especially the ones that don't use the right format
[6:43] <FakeSky> I don't think the Combine would turn Gordon into one of them.
[6:43] <Visiiri> Now that "App" is a noun, you should spell out Application; as application and application are totally different.
[6:43] <Visiiri> *application and application
[6:44] <Visiiri> ctrl b != ctrl u

[7:06] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Blizzard... Freakin WoW creators, right?
[7:06] <underd0g> I've tasted it once. It's like sprite or 7-Up, isn't it?
[7:07] <Zaneo> Stupid flop game that the blizzard team made after d2
[7:07] <underd0g> And yeah, they made WoW
[7:07] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Well
[7:07] <Yourself> i'm still amazed that there are people who only know blizzard for WoW and then have to ask if that was actually blizzard
[7:07] <Espiodude2|Sexy> It's kinda like a Sprite, with less tang, and more sweet
[7:07] <Zaneo> I know blizzard for Diablo
[7:07] <underd0g> Haha, yeah. Warcraft III is their best game imho
[7:07] <outsomnia|Clinton> wait, blizzard made diablo?
[7:07] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Blizzard made Warcraft and some other game that was old

[7:08] <Zaneo> east/west
[7:08] <PuyoDead> You forgot Rock 'n Roll Racing.

[7:08] <outsomnia|Clinton> Blizzard invented Halo.
[7:08] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Oh noes
[7:08] <underd0g> Yeah, sorry. That's worth mentioning
[7:08] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Teh @minz
[7:09] <Konogan> Not Blizzard.
[7:09] <Konogan> Bungie.
[7:09] <Zaneo> D3 looks like it will piss me off
[7:09] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Rock n' Roll Racing!? God that sounds like some LCD game
[7:09] <underd0g> Diablo is seriously overrated. I've never ever understood what's so good about those games
[7:09] <PuyoDead> More like AWESOME game.
[7:09] <Espiodude2|Sexy> xD
[7:10] <Zaneo> Diablo is what people compare games of similar type to
[7:10] <Yourself> diablo set the standard for procedurally generated content
[7:10] <vurtual> pft everyone knows that blizzard is known as the starcraft people
[7:10] <vurtual> also diablo is lame
[7:10] <vurtual> people calling it a roguelike
[7:10] <vurtual> when it's not
[7:10] <underd0g> Thank you, vurtual
[7:10] <Zaneo> depends how you were introduced to blizzard
[7:10] <vurtual> no, blizzard is always the starcraft guys
[7:10] * Espiodude2|Sexy hears nubz dat goe "bla bla bla
[7:10] <underd0g> To me, Blizzard will always be the Warcraft guys
[7:11] <Espiodude2|Sexy> To me, they will always be teh guys I gave 30 of my dollars to.
[7:11] <vurtual> 30 dollars
[7:11] <underd0g> Only 30? I take it that you're not a WoW-player then
[7:11] <PuyoDead> Newbs. They're totally the Lost Vikings guys.
[7:11] <Zaneo> Starcraft was 1998, Diablo was 1997
[7:11] <vurtual> pfft you can't even begin to count money spent
[7:12] <vurtual> until it goes over 100
[7:12] <Zaneo> so there.
[7:12] <vurtual> I've spent a few hundred on steam games alone. :D
[7:12] <vurtual> and, Zaneo?
[7:12] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Well, let's put it this way
[7:12] <Espiodude2|Sexy> I. Am poor.
[7:12] <Espiodude2|Sexy> And live. In. A . Box
[7:12] <Espiodude2|Sexy> No jk
[7:12] <Espiodude2|Sexy> s
[7:12] <Zaneo> Gmod has sucked away hundreds of hours lol
[7:12] <underd0g> I used to play Gmod back when it was free
[7:12] <vurtual> let's see what steam says is my most played game
[7:12] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Used to play Gmod non-stop.
[7:12] <fenixfurion> you live in a box yet you spend your free time on minecraft and Gmod, both games requiring a good PC?
[7:13] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Now I am admin of a nice clan
[7:13] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Cheers
[7:13] <fenixfurion> must be a nice box
[7:13] <vurtual> minecraft doesn't require a good pc at all
[7:13] <Zaneo> GMod is more ram intence
[7:13] <vurtual> at all.
[7:13] <Zaneo> intense*
[7:13] <fenixfurion> good/medium/meh
[7:13] <LG_Legacy> Espiodude2|Sexy I don't play gmod anymore :<
[7:13] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Well, I have a dual core laptop
[7:13] <Zaneo> I got gmod in jan, i have 400 hours
[7:13] <vurtual> I do too.
[7:13] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Gmod got boring...
[7:13] <vurtual> It's not the best.
[7:13] <vurtual> also guys
[7:13] <vurtual> What's your record for steam hours in two weeks
[7:13] <Zaneo> It has a lot of different game modes, but yeah it does get boring
[7:13] <underd0g> Over 9000
[7:14] <Zaneo> how can we check that vurtual?
[7:14] <vurtual> remember it
[7:14] <Espiodude2|Sexy> But one thing I hate is that my clan KEEPS SWITCHING THE RANKS UP!

[7:15] <Yourself> that's about as ridiculous as minecraft clans
[7:15] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Ingenious Gaming...
[7:15] <vurtual> at least 6 times the requirement
[7:15] <Zaneo> I put a lot of hours but i don't remember
[7:15] <Yourself> and only slightly more ridiculous than clans in general
[7:15] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Group, community, whatever :p
[7:15] <vurtual> shockingly
[7:15] <vurtual> apparently, my most-played game is garry's mod
[7:15] <vurtual> which I left on overnight at least a few times
[7:15] <Yourself> oh, that's different
[7:15] <vurtual> so, source sdk apparently
[7:16] <Zaneo> If i added up all my diablo hours from all my xfire accounts
[7:16] <vurtual> And... arma 2?
[7:16] <Zaneo> that would be my most
[7:16] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Arma 2...
[7:16] <Espiodude2|Sexy> ARMA 2
[7:16] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Lagged my laptop to shiz and I spent my 60 or 50 dollars on it >:(
[7:16] <vurtual> Arma ARMA ArmA ARma ArMa whatever
[7:16] <vurtual> Espiodude2|Sexy, it's a simulator

[8:52] <Dysgalt> Yes, you were there when I said it

[8:52] <Dysgalt> you spoke not 2 minutes after

[8:52] <Dysgalt> so why bother?
[8:52] <Saiko_> Your server 'sploded
[8:52] <ecrider> and I want to ask a question what do you mean by using ecrider like a tool ;)

[8:53] <Dysgalt> You apparently lost all interest in other servers

[9:06] <ecrider> yeah
[9:06] <Dysgalt> Invisible person stated there was a "recent" upgrade in large scale
[9:06] <Dysgalt> That implies something happened that did not happen

[9:06] <Dysgalt> therefore contradiction
[9:06] <Yourself> that's stupid
[9:07] <Yourself> it's stupid because it elevates pluto to a special position because 50 years ago we were ignorant about the amount of crap that's out beyond neptune's orbit

[9:07] <ecrider> upgrade - yes, large scale - yes, havnt been upgraded for months - yes (bofore I took it)
[9:08] <Dysgalt> That didn't make any since...
[9:09] <Dysgalt> you deny upgrade
[9:09] <ecrider> new version is still on indev vps, so currently no changes on public servers

[9:20] <Benie> Hi. I'm having trouble trying to convert a .dat to Mynecraft format. It keeps saying "Invalid map name" and the name has no special characters.

[9:20] <bildramer> haha
[9:21] <vurtual> so guys
[9:21] <Marach> it's like all tracks on Amber, mixed into one, but without drums
[9:21] <vurtual> If you can knock someone to -200 health in a quake game
[9:21] <vurtual> you apparently cause gibs to have 10x velocity
[9:22] <vurtual> a quad rocket/very low health person taking like, 60 damage quaded can easily do this.

[9:35] <Subhazard> I'm stealing my neighbors wifi
[9:35] <Subhazard> I cracked their WEP key
[9:35] <TestDummy> Congratulations.
[9:35] <Subhazard> But I'm having trouble with the DNS
[9:35] <TestDummy> What'd that take, five maybe ten minutes?
[9:35] <Subhazard> Yeah, the idiots had 3 people connected to it at the same time.
[9:35] <Subhazard> Got like a bagillion packets per second.
[9:35] <TestDummy> You're a super leet hacker.
[9:35] <TestDummy> You should work for the NSA.

[9:36] <Subhazard> So calm down, get the fuck over yourself, and possibly help me? : D
[9:37] <TestDummy> I wouldn't know, I'm not dumb enough to set a wireless network up with WEP.
[9:37] <TestDummy> Regarding your DNS issues, have you ever considered using something like OpenDNS?
[9:37] <Subhazard> What's that?
[9:37] <Subhazard> For some reason, I can only connect to facebook and anything that requires just a direct IP
[9:38] <Subhazard> But JUST facebook, very strange. Can't connect to Reddit or minecraft.net
[9:38] <TestDummy> OpenDNS is a DNS resolution service.
[9:38] <AndrewPH> Use google's DNSs if you aren't already
[9:38] <AndrewPH> they're nice
[9:38] <TestDummy> Or that.
[9:38] * TestDummy doesn't know Google's DNS off the top of his head.
[9:38] <Subhazard> So, just open it up, and set my DNS tooooo..?
[9:38] <TestDummy> JFGI
[9:38] <Subhazard> I can't.
[9:39] <Subhazard> No DNS
[9:39] <TestDummy> I'm sorry.
[9:39] <AndrewPH> google's is 4.4.8.8 and 8.8.8.8 I think
[9:39] <TestDummy> What would you do if DNS didn't work?
[9:39] <Subhazard> Ask in IRC?
[9:39] <TestDummy> 8.8.4.4 and 8.8.8.8, AndrewPH
[9:39] <TestDummy> I did Google it.
[9:39] <TestDummy> D:
[9:40] <AndrewPH> I got one half right and the other full right
[9:40] <Subhazard> So.
[9:40] <AndrewPH> deal w/ it
[9:40] <Subhazard> I can just set this as it?
[9:40] <TestDummy> No.
[9:40] <Subhazard> That actually works?
[9:40] <Subhazard> Granted, I don't even know what DNS stands for.
[9:40] <TestDummy> You have to go through a complex process that requires a virgin sacrafice and prayer to the sun gods.
[9:40] <TestDummy> But you seem to know what it does.

[9:40] <Subhazard> Okay, you're obviously too cynical to be asking for help.
[9:40] <TestDummy> Or at least, what doesn't work when it's gone.
[9:41] <TestDummy> Subhazard: I'm a computer technician, have a sour stomach and it's almost 11:00
[9:41] <Subhazard> You seem to know all the answers, yet can't spare any of them.
[9:41] <TestDummy> Of course I'm cynical.
[9:41] <TestDummy> :(
[9:41] <TestDummy> But yes, you should be able to use either of those addresses.
[9:41] <Subhazard> So, look at me. I'm humble about this. I admit that I know nothing, and I'm coming to a group of people where ONE of them might know something.
[9:41] <Subhazard> And that'll work? After this, I'm going to look up what a DNS is and what it does.

[10:28] <Merciless> I agree with Subhazard
[10:28] <Subhazard> So, there's no gears, and no steam, nothing moves that you make. So what part of the screams steampunk to you?
[10:28] <Subhazard> that*
[10:28] <Subhazard> Steampunk would be theme breaking.
[10:28] <Speljohan_> steampunk is a bad theme anyway

[10:29] <Subhazard> Nope.
[10:29] <Subhazard> Demonic, occultist.
[10:29] <outsomnia|Clinton> Perhaps cybercore?
[10:29] <vurtual> quakey medieval dark fantasy?
[10:29] <outsomnia|Clinton> Isn't that the same?
[10:29] <Subhazard> Cyberpunk*
[10:29] <Speljohan_> that would be best vurtual
[10:29] <vurtual> ok
[10:29] <Subhazard> Cyberpunk is much different than steampunk.
[10:29] <vurtual> except minecraft-themed
[10:29] <vurtual> so swatikas
[10:29] <Speljohan_> but then, i am the stereotype of a classic rpg nerd
[10:29] <Speljohan_> which means
[10:29] <Speljohan_> medieval fantasy will never be oversaturated for me
[10:29] <vurtual> swastikas and notches, griefer names in some strange language.
[10:29] <Subhazard> Steampunk = Gears and pistons Cyberpunk = Nanotechnology, quantum entanglement, energy manipulation and fiber optics
[10:29] <vurtual> no no cyberpunk is like
[10:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> So when is Notch going to implement dice?
[10:30] <vurtual> nanotechnology rammed into your face
[10:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> ALso cyberpunk = dystopias.
[10:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> |:L
[10:30] <vurtual> quantum entanglement fleshlights
[10:30] <Speljohan_> dystopias are awful
[10:30] <vurtual> energy manipulation deathrays
[10:30] <Subhazard> Cyberunk =/= dystopias
[10:30] <vurtual> fiber optic eyes
[10:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> note the [punk] in both theme titles.
[10:30] <Subhazard> cyberpunk*
[10:30] <Speljohan_> the environments always feel so dull
[10:30] <vurtual> half-life 2 was dystopic
[10:30] <Subhazard> Punk simply means rebelling from the norm.
[10:30] <vurtual> it wasn't THAT dull
[10:30] <Subhazard> CYBERPUNK DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DYSTOPIAN
[10:30] <Speljohan_> true
[10:30] <Speljohan_> but i was talking about dystopia in general
[10:30] <Speljohan_> :P
[10:30] <Subhazard> No
[10:31] <KodaichiZero> Atlus came out with a Steampunk MMo not too long ago
[10:31] <Subhazard> You said Cyberpunk = Dystopia
[10:31] <Speljohan_> no i didnt
[10:31] <Speljohan_> <Speljohan_> dystopias are awful
[10:31] <Speljohan_> <Speljohan_> the environments always feel so dull
[10:31] <KodaichiZero> Atlus made Snowboard Kids, so...
[10:31] <Speljohan_> see
[10:31] * outsomnia|Clinton has acquired troll status \o/
[10:31] <KodaichiZero> I friggin love Atlus
[10:31] <outsomnia|Clinton> [23:31] <KodaichiZero> I friggin love Atlus
[10:31] <outsomnia|Clinton> |:L
[10:31] <Speljohan_> mmo's suck
[10:31] <Subhazard> Outsamnia did
[10:31] <Speljohan_> !
[10:31] <Subhazard> I'd like to see an FPSMMO
[10:31] <Subhazard> Not an MMORPG that uses guns.
[10:31] <KodaichiZero> Atlus, the company
[10:31] <Subhazard> No
[10:31] <Speljohan_> there has been one Superwafflez
[10:31] <Subhazard> an FPSMMO
[10:31] <Speljohan_> Subhazard*
[10:31] <Speljohan_> planetside
[10:31] <Speljohan_> it was pretty cool
[10:32] <vurtual> SNOWBOARD KIDS
[10:32] <outsomnia|Clinton> Aren't there plenty that can go into first-person mode?
[10:32] <Speljohan_> they are working on planetside 2 apparently
[10:32] <vurtual> DID I HEAR SNOWBOARD KIDS

[10:32] <vurtual> fps mmos are horrible
[10:32] <vurtual> horrible horrible
[10:32] <outsomnia|Clinton> Which is?
[10:32] <Speljohan_> they all have this silly standard of third person

[10:32] <vurtual> It's like having vs tetris with levels and drastic powerups
[10:32] <Subhazard> Planetside was amazing.
[10:32] <Subhazard> I'd like to see a S.T.A.L.K.E.R mmo
[10:32] <Subhazard> That's not the fucking point Outsomnia
[10:32] <Subhazard> An FPSMMO wouldn't use RPG elements.
[10:32] <Subhazard> It would be a massively multiplayer shooting game.
[10:32] <vurtual> ever played against an all-linepiece guy in tetris ds?
[10:33] * Titans (Mibbit@bas3-sudbury98-1168052226.dsl.bell.ca) Quit (Quit: http://www.mibbit.com ajax IRC Client)
[10:33] <Speljohan_> ^
[10:33] <vurtual> No matter what, any mmo fps would be like that eventually
[10:33] <Speljohan_> sad truth
[10:33] <Speljohan_> market today: "IF IT DOESNT HAVE LEVELS IT SUCKS"
[10:33] <outsomnia|Clinton> [23:31] <Subhazard> Not an MMORPG that uses guns.
[10:33] <outsomnia|Clinton> [23:32] <Subhazard> It would be a massively multiplayer shooting game.
[10:33] <Speljohan_> market today: "IF IT DOESNT HAVE LEVELS IT SUCKS"
[10:33] <outsomnia|Clinton> Welp.
[10:33] <vurtual> The market uesd to be "if it doesn't have levels it sucks"
[10:33] <Speljohan_> planetside solved it in a neat way however
[10:33] <Speljohan_> they still had progression kinda
[10:33] <Subhazard> Where you could trade and build settlements and whatnot, but it would be based on skill, not numbers.
[10:33] <Subhazard> Vurtual, name one fpsmmo
[10:33] <Subhazard> Name one fpsmmo besides planetside (which rocked)
[10:33] <Subhazard> Why are you quoting me Outsomnia
[10:33] <Speljohan_> you needed to get a license for driving vehicles etc
[10:34] <Speljohan_> which required considerable work
[10:34] <vurtual> Except those levels were usually something like E number M number.
[10:34] <Subhazard> Yeah, progression is different than RPG.
[10:34] <Speljohan_> progression in the average mmo is complete turd however
[10:34] <vurtual> and generally every new E you had to get all your new weapons
[10:34] <Speljohan_> you might as well get a job instead
[10:34] <Speljohan_> at least that makes you money
[10:34] <Subhazard> That's why I like the idea of an MMOFPS
[10:35] <Subhazard> The BEST players would have the best gear, or the most fortunate.
[10:35] <Speljohan_> mh
[10:35] <vurtual> Subhazard
[10:35] <Subhazard> Not the people who simply play the longest.
[10:35] <Speljohan_> or no gear at all
[10:35] <vurtual> If a player was good
[10:35] <outsomnia|Clinton> Because all jobs just involve you sitting there and clikkan.
[10:35] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:35] <outsomnia|Clinton> |:L
[10:35] <Speljohan_> outsomnia|Clinton plenty of jobs do :P
[10:35] <Speljohan_> well
[10:35] <vurtual> They'd be offended by the concept of long-term gear advantage
[10:35] <Speljohan_> often more manula labour
[10:35] <Speljohan_> but still
[10:35] <vurtual> Infact, the fps community has always been about fair play.
[10:35] <Speljohan_> manual*
[10:35] <Subhazard> No.
[10:35] <outsomnia|Clinton> No.
[10:35] <Speljohan_> long term gear advantage is stupid tho
[10:35] <Subhazard> Think of it this way, you kill say 40 people, and you get some reputation points which allows you access to better gear and weapons.
[10:36] <Speljohan_> or..
[10:36] <vurtual> Typekilling? Team imbalance? Camping?
[10:36] <Speljohan_> you get the gear of the person you kills
[10:36] <Speljohan_> much better
[10:36] <outsomnia|Clinton> Modern Warfare 2?
[10:36] <outsomnia|Clinton> Except more multiplayer?
[10:36] <Subhazard> The shittier weapons would still do damage, but they'd be inaccurate, maybe less powerful, but a headshot is a gauranteed kill
[10:36] <Subhazard> Think STALKER but MUCH bigger.
[10:36] <vurtual> Playing a game where you have the blaster or pistol or whatever, and your enemy has an auto-railgun?
[10:36] <vurtual> nowhere near fun
[10:36] <outsomnia|Clinton> ^
[10:36] <vurtual> also garunteed kill headshots suck
[10:36] <Speljohan_> i disagree
[10:36] <Subhazard> Imagine walking across the desert when suddenly a sniper misses you by only an inch, and you sprint out across the dunes trying to get to a rock for cover.
[10:36] <Speljohan_> it should at least be 99% chance of kill
[10:36] <outsomnia|Clinton> Camp spawn with autoaim 9999 miniguns.
[10:36] <Speljohan_> to reflect reality
[10:36] <Speljohan_> !
[10:36] <vurtual> Name some really really great FPSes that had instakill headshots.
[10:37] <Subhazard> You throw a smoke and charge up the hill and knife him in the face. Now you have his sniper rifle.
[10:37] <Speljohan_> i duno, i dont play fps's
[10:37] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:37] <vurtual> Subhazard, nobody's gonna miss

[10:37] <Subhazard> Okay. Counterstrike Vurtual
[10:37] <Subhazard> Counterstrike has instakill headshots.
[10:37] <Subhazard> Excellent game.
[10:37] <vurtual> hmmm.
[10:37] <vurtual> Nope
[10:37] <Subhazard> Call of Duty.
[10:37] <vurtual> Only like, 1-2 guns do that in cs
[10:37] <Speljohan_> not sure if cod2 had instakill hs
[10:37] <Subhazard> Red Orchestra
[10:37] <Speljohan_> but i played cod2 aot
[10:37] <Speljohan_> alot*
[10:37] <Speljohan_> back in da days
[10:37] <vurtual> RO's a sim
[10:37] <Subhazard> NeoTokryo
[10:37] <vurtual> even then, you can live
[10:37] <Subhazard> Vurtual, all guns do that..
[10:38] <Subhazard> Either that, or they take a LOT of health
[10:38] <vurtual> neotokyo's not very good. :/
[10:38] <vurtual> you can take headshots from most guns.
[10:38] <vurtual> with a helmet too
[10:38] <Subhazard> If I shoot you once in the head in counterstrike, with a glock, you're gonna feel it.
[10:38] <Yourself> hmm, my code isn't working and i don't know why
[10:38] <vurtual> helmet really stops headshots
[10:38] <Speljohan_> i'm still awaiting the first real hybrid mmo to be released
[10:38] <Yourself> well, it's working, but it's producing the wrong answer
[10:38] <Subhazard> Vurtual, if I shoot you in the head with an AK in counterstrike, you're dead.
[10:38] <outsomnia|Clinton> Hybrid of what?
[10:38] <Speljohan_> sandbox/theme park
[10:38] <vurtual> Yeah, but the AK's got a huge amount of damage already.
[10:38] <outsomnia|Clinton> Hybrid isn't a genre you know, it has to be a mix of [this] and [that].
[10:38] <Subhazard> If I shoot you in the head with a p90 you're dead.
[10:38] <vurtual> AWP's similar, and scout.
[10:39] <Subhazard> MP5... dead.
[10:39] <Speljohan_> i know outsomnia|Clinton
[10:39] <Speljohan_> like i said
[10:39] <Subhazard> M16, dead.
[10:39] <vurtual> the p90 fires the five seven round
[10:39] <Subhazard> Shotgun, dead
[10:39] <vurtual> there's no m16.
[10:39] <Speljohan_> a hybrid between sandbox and theme park
[10:39] <vurtual> shotgun, how many pellets?
[10:39] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:39] <Subhazard> WHATEVER
[10:39] <Subhazard> Galil, dead.
[10:39] <outsomnia|Clinton> A sandbox/themeparksim mmo, brilliant!
[10:39] <Subhazard> UMP, dead.
[10:39] <vurtual> Anyways, it would take at least two shots from a p90/five seven to headshot kill
[10:39] <vurtual> most guns take at least two.
[10:39] <Subhazard> Not when I fire it.
[10:39] <vurtual> only the high-power ones can deal one
[10:39] <Subhazard> Maybe you shouldn't get the foot confused with the head.
[10:39] <vurtual> awp can kill with foot
[10:39] <Speljohan_> well, theme park mmo's are incredibly dull and sandboxes are too niche to succeed outsomnia|Clinton
[10:39] <vurtual> awp 4ever man
[10:39] <Subhazard> I hate AWPs
[10:39] <Speljohan_> the solution would be a hybrid
[10:39] <Subhazard> Fuck Awps, you suck.
[10:39] <Speljohan_> cater both groups
[10:40] * vurtual awps Subhazard in the foot
[10:40] <outsomnia|Clinton> Are there even any theme park mmo's?
[10:40] <Subhazard> You shouldn't die from a footshot, that's stupid
[10:40] <Speljohan_> pretty much every single mmo outsomnia|Clinton
[10:40] <outsomnia|Clinton> :|
[10:40] <Subhazard> Theme park MMO's?
[10:40] <Subhazard> That's stupid.
[10:40] <Speljohan_> everquest started it
[10:40] <vurtual> have you ever seen someone get their leg hit that hard?
[10:40] <vurtual> it flies off!
[10:40] <outsomnia|Clinton> Clarity pleasE?
[10:40] <outsomnia|Clinton> *please
[10:40] <vurtual> Anyways none of you are game designers.
[10:40] <Subhazard> Okay, what would be fun about a theme park MMO?
[10:40] <Speljohan_> actually i am vurtual
[10:40] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:40] <Speljohan_> indie-game designer anyways
[10:40] <Subhazard> I'm a mapper for many source games.
[10:40] <Speljohan_> btw
[10:41] <Subhazard> I study game theory, what makes games fun
[10:41] <Speljohan_> theme park == the average shit mmorpg
[10:41] <Speljohan_> eg
[10:41] <Speljohan_> grind to max level
[10:41] <vurtual> you STUDY
[10:41] <outsomnia|Clinton> inb4 50k disney and sea world ripoffs
[10:41] <vurtual> Do you APPLY?
[10:41] <Speljohan_> run the same isntance over and over again
[10:41] <Subhazard> Yes, ofcourse.
[10:41] <vurtual> Do you MAKE MONEY from applying?
[10:41] <vurtual> Do people even go "That guy, he's awesome at this."
[10:41] <Subhazard> do I have to make money to design fun?
[10:41] <outsomnia|Clinton> Yes
[10:41] <Subhazard> Many modders don't make a cent, are you saying their work is any less legitimate?
[10:41] <vurtual> You either become legendary, or profit, that's how you gauge someone.
[10:41] <Speljohan_> i am not a game designer in terms of cool ideas etc
[10:41] <Speljohan_> but
[10:42] <Speljohan_> i am a game designer in terms of frameworks/code
[10:42] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:42] <Subhazard> No, that's pathetic.
[10:42] <Subhazard> That's a terribly capitalist way to look at life.
[10:42] <Speljohan_> ^
[10:42] <Subhazard> 'Oh, he isn't worth anything because no one's paying him'
[10:42] <vurtual> So wait, you can claim to be good, even though nobody's said you're good?
[10:42] <Subhazard> We make things, us creators in this world, because we enjoy the act of creation.
[10:42] <Speljohan_> who said anything about good?
[10:42] <Subhazard> Whether someone wants to pay me, is entirely their decision. I wouldn't pay me. I do it as a hobby.
[10:42] <Speljohan_> yeh Subhazard
[10:42] <Speljohan_> though i'm taking it to the next level
[10:42] <Speljohan_> i don't want a job
[10:43] <vurtual> Anyways, if you are designers, you are horrible at it.
[10:43] <Speljohan_> i want to live off my work
[10:43] <Subhazard> Money has no correlation with skill.
[10:43] <Speljohan_> ^
[10:43] <Subhazard> I mean fuck, Tim and Eric is a TV show.
[10:43] <Subhazard> Madden sells the same game every year.
[10:43] <Subhazard> EA makes MAD bank, and most of their games are shit.
[10:43] <outsomnia|Clinton> Consider what demographics they sell to.
[10:43] <Subhazard> Twilight makes SHITLOADS of money.
[10:43] <Speljohan_> they are smart with marketing
[10:43] <Speljohan_> useless game designers
[10:43] <Subhazard> And it's a terrible book series.
[10:43] <outsomnia|Clinton> They're considered GOLD by their fans.
[10:43] <outsomnia|Clinton> Also
[10:43] <outsomnia|Clinton> >opinions
[10:44] <Subhazard> It's about marketing and exposure.
[10:44] <outsomnia|Clinton> and
[10:44] <outsomnia|Clinton> >tastes
[10:44] <Subhazard> Not neccesarily skill.
[10:44] <Speljohan_> ^
[10:44] <Subhazard> All those people you hear on the radio?
[10:44] <Speljohan_> take the EA sports series
[10:44] <Subhazard> They aren't the best artists.
[10:44] <Speljohan_> it's like
[10:44] <Subhazard> In fact, I would say they're definately NOT some of the best artists.
[10:44] <Speljohan_> not like it's hard to add new revision of dx every year
[10:44] <Speljohan_> implement a few polishes
[10:44] <Speljohan_> etc
[10:44] <Subhazard> They do however, know the right people, and get exposed.
[10:44] <Subhazard> Fatboy slim is not the best electronica artist.
[10:44] <outsomnia|Clinton> No johan
[10:44] <Subhazard> But he is indeed the most prolific.

[10:45] <Speljohan_> i dont play sport games, i wouldn't know
[10:45] <Subhazard> Okay, so you see my point then.
[10:45] <Speljohan_> well, i used to play colin mcrae alot
[10:45] <Speljohan_> with my dad
[10:45] <outsomnia|Clinton> Of course I've been seeing your point.
[10:45] <Speljohan_> but that was back in 2000
[10:45] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:45] <outsomnia|Clinton> I just like to generate as much discussion as possible.
[10:45] <Speljohan_> ^
[10:45] <Speljohan_> it is a good way to pass time
[10:46] <Subhazard> No, that's a copout for being wrong.

[10:52] <Speljohan_> loll
[10:53] <outsomnia|Clinton> slightly frowning mouth with large furrowed brow over it.
[10:53] <Speljohan_> ps game will be playable in browser outsomnia|Clinton
[10:53] <KodaichiZero> oh I see
[10:53] <Speljohan_> a pre-alpha will be public
[10:53] <KodaichiZero> Disgruntled
[10:53] <Speljohan_> so you can try it out for yourself
[10:53] <Speljohan_> :P
[10:53] <outsomnia|Clinton> >playable in browser
[10:53] <KodaichiZero> I tried it out in something else
[10:53] <outsomnia|Clinton> I wish you luck with it sir.
[10:53] <Speljohan_> hopefully people can give some positive/negative criticism
[10:53] <Speljohan_> so we can polish
[10:53] <Speljohan_> outsomnia|Clinton, it will obviously have a standalone client as well
[10:53] <Speljohan_> however, it will support full screen in browser
[10:53] <Speljohan_> lol

[10:56] <Speljohan_> and possibly different terrain types

[10:56] <Speljohan_> lel
[10:56] <Azu> made that just now
[10:56] <KodaichiZero> with the final product include cute female characters and badass male characters?
[10:57] <Speljohan_> lol KodaichiZero
[10:57] <Speljohan_> i'm not in charge of graphics/models
[10:57] <Speljohan_> that's my associate's work
[10:57] <Subhazard> Does this have any possibility of being made?
[10:57] <Speljohan_> so i'm not sure yet
[10:57] <KodaichiZero> depenlol k
[10:57] <Speljohan_> it most certainly does Subhazard
[10:57] <Subhazard> Because it sounds awesome, except for the whole birdseyeview stuff
[10:58] <Subhazard> Got anything presentable yet?
[10:58] <Speljohan_> the core framework is nearly complete
[10:58] <outsomnia|Clinton> They're still brainstorming the idea.
[10:58] <Speljohan_> started a few days ago Subhazard
[10:58] <Speljohan_> and yeah
[10:58] <Speljohan_> everything isn't planned
[10:58] * vurtual (vurtual@74.206.62.26) has joined #minecraft
[10:58] <vurtual> WHY DO I KEEP PINGING
[10:58] <Subhazard> I REALLY don't recommend birds eye view.
[10:58] <Speljohan_> we're just getting core engine up and running asap
[10:58] <outsomnia|Clinton> dohohoh.
[10:58] <KodaichiZero> Minecraft survival doesn't need blue dye
[10:58] <Speljohan_> Subhazard first game will be like that
[10:58] <Speljohan_> but
[10:58] <Subhazard> Birds eye view, plus.. fort building.. ick.
[10:58] <outsomnia|Clinton> Koda, yes it does.
[10:58] <KodaichiZero> the water's already freaking blue enough
[10:58] <Speljohan_> if all goes well engine will be reused
[10:58] <Subhazard> I don't like birds eye in a 3D engine
[10:58] <KodaichiZero> the water is blue dye
[10:58] <Speljohan_> engine is generic
[10:58] <Speljohan_> so making it an fps isn't hard
[10:58] <Griskard> Johan
[10:59] <Speljohan_> but i will want to have bird's eye at first
[10:59] <Griskard> What are we talking about?
[10:59] <Speljohan_> because it's the way i want to play
[10:59] <Speljohan_> lol
[10:59] <outsomnia|Clinton> How else are our (eventual) submarines supposed to blend in well when assaulting enemy bases?
[10:59] <Speljohan_> new game project Griskard
[10:59] <Griskard> How far along is it?
[10:59] <KodaichiZero> 2nd-person view: seeing your character through the eyes of someone following you around
[10:59] <Speljohan_> planning stage
[10:59] <outsomnia|Clinton> ^
[10:59] <outsomnia|Clinton> still tinkering with ideas.
[10:59] <Subhazard> Kodaichi
[10:59] <Subhazard> That game = Siren
[10:59] <Speljohan_> and basic core engine
[11:00] <outsomnia|Clinton> Ya
[11:00] <Subhazard> Which is scary as shit.
[11:00] <KodaichiZero> lol
[11:00] <Subhazard> But Siren uses 2nd person view.
[11:00] <outsomnia|Clinton> Which is why I want to see more of it
[11:00] <Speljohan_> i'd give it a few weeks before a basic tech demo is out outsomnia|Clinton
[11:00] <Speljohan_> eg
[11:00] <outsomnia|Clinton> except a shooter
[11:00] <Speljohan_> walk around
[11:00] <Speljohan_> shoot
[11:00] <Speljohan_> etc
[11:00] <outsomnia|Clinton> which would make it extra trippy.
[11:00] <Speljohan_> i need to read up on glsl
[11:00] <Speljohan_> so that i can use hot shaders
[11:01] <outsomnia|Clinton> And near-only 2nd-person, so that basically you'll be seeing through the eyes of the enemies ducking behind corners and taking shots at you (which is when you can see yourself, etc) the whole time.

[11:03] <Subhazard> That sounds like it wants to be innovatng
[11:03] <Subhazard> innovative
[11:03] <Subhazard> But I think there's a reason why people don't make 2nd person games.

[11:04] <outsomnia|Clinton> Yep.
[11:05] <Speljohan_> there we go
[11:05] <outsomnia|Clinton> huh?
[11:05] <Speljohan_> framerate dependency system added
[11:05] <Speljohan_> eg, doesn't matter how slow your pc is, game will adjust to your pc speed
[11:06] <outsomnia|Clinton> What if I'm on a windows 98 era computer?
[11:06] <mnjiman> I <3 Sub.
[11:06] <Subhazard> WHy the love?
[11:07] <Subhazard> Just out of curiousity
[11:07] <outsomnia|Clinton> A better question would be, why NOT the love?
[11:07] <outsomnia|Clinton> |:L
[11:07] <mnjiman> talking to you yesterday gave me energy to put more love into my castle
[11:07] <Speljohan_> would still adjust outsomnia|Clinton
[11:07] <Subhazard> Nice.
[11:07] <Speljohan_> but it would probably not run well
[11:07] <Subhazard> I can't figure out what to put in mine.
[11:07] <Speljohan_> lol
[11:07] <Subhazard> It's all complete, but it's empty on the inside.
[11:07] * AndrewPH is now known as AndrewPH|AFK
[11:07] <mnjiman> Make a gaint keep
[11:07] <outsomnia|Clinton> So the graphics can scale down/up almost completely?
[11:07] <Speljohan_> trying to make it as backwards-compatible as possible however
[11:07] <Subhazard> I put the difficulty to max, and hordes of enemies shivered at the doorstep
[11:07] <Subhazard> And didn't DARE enter.
[11:07] <Speljohan_> nah, that will be adjusted by settings obviously outsomnia|Clinton
[11:08] <Speljohan_> but i will definately add backwards compatibility all the way down to opengl 1.0
[11:08] <mnjiman> i have an idea
[11:08] <mnjiman> moat
[11:08] <Speljohan_> so it should play decently on old machines
[11:08] <mnjiman> to the bottom of the map
[11:08] <Subhazard> It's an island castle.
[11:08] <outsomnia|Clinton> Monsters be spawning inside my base, it be pissin' me off.
[11:08] <mnjiman> dam the water
[11:08] <Subhazard> Torch that shit Outsomnia
[11:08] <outsomnia|Clinton> goddom, why is everyone making an island castle
[11:08] <Subhazard> Don't you know anything.
[11:08] <LG_Legacy> I'm pretty bored right nowe
[11:09] <Subhazard> Because there's not enough flat space on land?
[11:09] <Speljohan_> oh, mod support will def be part of engine outsomnia|Clinton
[11:09] <mnjiman> Outsomnia
[11:09] <outsomnia|Clinton> Sub, I've spent over hundreds of torches on it.
[11:09] <mnjiman> my castle is Inland
[11:09] <Speljohan_> probably LUA scripting
[11:09] <Speljohan_> for weapons
[11:09] <Speljohan_> etc
[11:09] <outsomnia|Clinton> luuuuuaaaaa

[11:12] <TestDummy> I mean, DAMN.
[11:12] <Speljohan_> that was my first opengl project ^
[11:12] <outsomnia|Clinton> ala chrono trigger or final fantasy (the early ones)
[11:13] <Speljohan_> aimed at learning opengl
[11:13] <mnjiman> 1 hour to design a keep
[11:13] <mnjiman> ..
[11:13] <Speljohan_> and it worked out well
[11:13] <mnjiman> so stupid
[11:13] <outsomnia|Clinton> as stated by the page
[11:13] <mnjiman> no DNS?
[11:13] <Subhazard> I can't figure out the problem either (other than that I'm stealing from my neighbors)
[11:13] <Subhazard> No one will help me.
[11:13] <mnjiman> ok im a nub
[11:13] <mnjiman> what do you mean no DNS
[11:13] <Speljohan_> try a dns flush Subhazard
[11:13] <Speljohan_> cmd -> ipconfig /flushdns
[11:13] <TestDummy> mnjiman: He doesn't know how to put an IP adddress into a dialog box.

[11:27] <vurtual> no no
[11:27] <vurtual> okay none of us are on the same topic
[11:27] <vurtual> it's ok, just panic
[11:28] <Subhazard> That's retarted.
[11:28] <Subhazard> You never want to make an enemy immortal in a game.
[11:28] <Subhazard> Do you even think before you suggest an idea?
[11:28] <Subhazard> If an enemy is immortal, then there's no point to having weapons.
[11:28] <vurtual> there's lots of "immortal" enemies
[11:28] <vurtual> end boss of quake
[11:28] <vurtual> tentacle in half-life
[11:28] <Subhazard> And there's no point to playing.
[11:28] <Subhazard> He's not immortal.
[11:28] <vurtual> pit worm in opposing force
[11:28] <Subhazard> You can kill him.
[11:28] <Subhazard> You kill the tentacle too
[11:29] <vurtual> yeah
[11:29] <Subhazard> I never played opposing force.
[11:29] <vurtual> they don't have hp
[11:29] <vurtual> you hit buttons to kill them.
[11:29] <vurtual> (or telefrag)
[11:29] <Subhazard> There's a difference between not being effected by weapons, and immortal.
[11:29] <Subhazard> And you never want to make moving enemies immortal.
[11:29] <vurtual> they have no hp whatsoever, their "death" is just an animation.
[11:29] <vurtual> THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE, WAITING
[11:29] <Subhazard> Okay no.
[11:30] <Subhazard> That's a game developement copout.
[11:30] <vurtual> Also I do remember lots of enemies in some games being die-proof
[11:30] * Dysgalt is now known as Dys|Sleep
[11:30] <vurtual> actually the gfed turrets in metroid prime 3 don't die
[11:30] <vurtual> at all
[11:30] <Subhazard> If you want an enemy to be scary, have it breathe heavily as it runs around invisible, ONLY appearing just before it attacks you, and after that it immediately goes invisible again and runs off before coming back for more.
[11:30] <outsomnia|Clinton> Enemies you can't kill but sure as hell can slow down a lot until they're just a minor nuisance?
[11:30] <Subhazard> You can'
[11:30] <vurtual> You can try, but eventually they fire a vortex of death
[11:30] <Subhazard> You can't see it, but you can HEAR it the whole time.
[11:30] <vurtual> Subhazard, hidden: source?
[11:30] <vurtual> basically a game about an enemy who is that
[11:31] <Subhazard> S.T.A.L.K.E.R
[11:31] <Subhazard> Shadow of Chernobyl.
[11:31] <vurtual> the only way you could see it is by faint distortion
[11:31] <Subhazard> Blood suckers.
[11:31] <vurtual> and it wasn't scary
[11:31] <vurtual> it was more hillraious
[11:31] <Subhazard> Vurtual, that game was terribly made.
[11:31] <vurtual> having someone throw boxes at you constantly
[11:31] <Subhazard> Go play Stalker
[11:31] <vurtual> "Your game sucks, play x"
[11:31] <vurtual> Me and all my friends love hidden: source
[11:31] <Subhazard> Bloodsuckers are invisible, but they run around breathing really heavily, before they appear and claw you to death.
[11:32] <vurtual> I know what bloodsuckers are
[11:32] <vurtual> you can still easily shoot them to bits
[11:32] <Subhazard> After you figure out how to fight them.
[11:32] <outsomnia|Clinton> or have it be substantially large, place it (unconcious) and you in a giant room and force the player to solver puzzles around the monster, wondering when it's going to suddenly jump up ant bite at you, ala RE4 regenerators.
[11:32] <Subhazard> But when you first come across a bloodsucker, it's the scariest thing ever.
[11:32] <mnjiman> ..
[11:32] <Subhazard> Controllers are fucking scary too.
[11:32] <Subhazard> They go against a players instinct to duck behind cover and trade shots.
[11:33] <vurtual> My instinct is to "hit it with whatever kills it the most"
[11:33] <outsomnia|Clinton> ^
[11:33] <Subhazard> The farther away you are (if it can still see you) the harder the damage and the effect.
[11:33] <vurtual> The only enemies I found honestly scary were the ichthyosaur from half-life and... the ichthyosaur from half-life.
[11:33] <Subhazard> In STALKER SoC
[11:33] <Subhazard> You have to run, headfirst, towards Controllers
[11:33] <Subhazard> Which fucks their brain and they kind of go catatonic
[11:33] <Subhazard> And then you can kill them.
[11:33] <vurtual> I'm trying to think of another scary enemy but I can't
[11:33] <Subhazard> The ichthyosaur was very scary.
[11:34] <outsomnia|Clinton> Survival Horror's not scary when you have a revolving-clip rocket-launcher.
[11:34] <Subhazard> How about the fast zombie?
[11:34] <Subhazard> Or the poison headcrab, FUCK THAT MONSTER
[11:34] <Subhazard> You can hear them, but you can't see them.
[11:34] <Subhazard> Poison headcrab zombie was even worse.
[11:34] * Othilious1 (Othilious@94.157.181.15) has joined #minecraft
[11:34] <vurtual> no
[11:34] <vurtual> Those weren't scary
[11:34] <vurtual> My brother, who is a bit older than me, always claimed they were "so scary"
[11:34] <vurtual> I just shot them to bits and was like "Oookay."
[11:34] <vurtual> I did get startled by poison zombies just coming around a corner for a few times
[11:35] <vurtual> But they never really scared me that much.
[11:35] <Subhazard> The Antlion Guard was scary when I first came across it
[11:35] <Subhazard> But then I got used to fighting it
[11:35] <vurtual> pffft
[11:35] <vurtual> cowaaard
[11:35] <Subhazard> and just toyed with it until it died
[11:35] <vurtual> Infact nowadays only ichthyosaurs can scare me in games
[11:35] <Subhazard> I can go mono-e-mono with an antlion guard with a crowbar now.
[11:35] <vurtual> I can do that too
[11:35] <Subhazard> But when I first came across one I was like FUCK
[11:35] <vurtual> anyone can
[11:35] <vurtual> Certain levels can creep me out alot to the point I want to stop, generally due to creepy flesh-walls and such.
[11:36] <vurtual> and water in goldsrc is scary by proxy
[11:36] <Subhazard> Flesh walls and other biogoop doesn't scary.
[11:36] <Subhazard> isn't scary to me*
[11:36] <Subhazard> I just look at that and go 'seen it before'
[11:36] <Subhazard> and move on.
[11:36] <mnjiman> omfg, i accidentally have my Keep right ontop of my underground base area.
[11:36] <Subhazard> Penumbra was VERY SCARY
[11:36] <Othilious1> System Shock 2: the pioneer of goobly-goop walls :D
[11:36] <Subhazard> Fuck those wolves, FUCK THOSE WOLVES
[11:36] <Subhazard> Penumbra
[11:36] <mnjiman> /happy
[11:37] <vurtual> lost world and arena gate are the only levels I can't really easily play in quake live
[11:37] <Subhazard> Eventually, you figure out how to beat them
[11:37] <Subhazard> But when you first came across the wolves, I nearly pissed myself.
[11:37] <vurtual> due to the creepy ceiling-mouth and wall-mouth that hides the red armor
[11:37] <Subhazard> (All you have to do is sit on a box and whack them a bunch)
[11:37] <Subhazard> Penumbra is scarier than all hell.
[11:37] <Subhazard> Siren is very scary.
[11:37] <Subhazard> Stalker is very scary.
[11:37] <mnjiman> I came across a sheep inside my base in minecraft and it scared the shit out of me. I jumped out of my chair and smashed my knee against my computer desk
[11:37] <Subhazard> Doom III is child's play.
[11:38] <vurtual> anyways you are all cowards
[11:38] <Subhazard> Resident Evil is laughable.
[11:38] <Othilious1> Siren? The pirana bytes RPG? That wasn't scary? o.O
[11:38] <vurtual> my excuse is that I have a psychological fear of sea-fish
[11:38] <mnjiman> If something comes out of no where and your not expecting it
[11:38] <vurtual> and even then some don't scare me
[11:38] <Subhazard> Siren the 2nd person horror game.
[11:38] <mnjiman> you will be scared.
[11:38] <Othilious1> Oh. Never played that.
[11:38] <Subhazard> I've been killed by a sheep.
[11:38] <vurtual> mnjiman, not if you're a one man army SPACE MARINE
[11:38] <Subhazard> Fucked pushed me off a bridge.
[11:38] <Subhazard> Fucker*
[11:38] <vurtual> Enemy coming around the corner?
[11:38] <vurtual> Too bad I don't have the bfg out.
[11:39] <Subhazard> See, in Doom III, you just expect it
[11:39] <Subhazard> There's always some bitch around the corner.
[11:39] <vurtual> great, now I'm gonna have to walk behind to that medkit.
[11:39] <Subhazard> It's almost like 'cool, a corner, time to rock'
[11:39] <vurtual> Old shooters are the pinnacle of enemies-around-corners
[11:39] <vurtual> random alcoves, corners, and mysterious closets with walls that drop down are the ultimate source of enemies.

[11:39] <Subhazard> I like it when enemies come out of unexpected angles.
[11:39] <vurtual> Seriously, do they just... wait there, all day?
[11:39] <vurtual> Why are they hiding there?
[11:39] <Subhazard> Or when they rush you.
[11:39] <Subhazard> Being rushed sucks.
[11:39] <vurtual> There's no way for them to just pop in.
[11:39] <vurtual> Why are they hiding there?
[11:40] <Subhazard> Pinkies in a tight hallway are always scary.
[11:40] <vurtual> "Durp durp let's just sit behind this wall for a few days."
[11:40] <Subhazard> In Doom III
[11:40] <Subhazard> It's like 'NOWHERE TO RUN'
[11:40] <outsomnia|Clinton> or hiding in closets and lockers
[11:40] <vurtual> "Huurr I HEAR BADGUY durrrrh run out and kill RUN OUT AND KILL" *jumps out* "hhHhTRESSPASSAR!"
[11:40] <outsomnia|Clinton> ya, like doom 3
[11:40] <vurtual> *BOOM*
[11:40] <vurtual> "Durrhh...."

[11:43] <vurtual> the guy who has twice that

[13:18] <Speljohan_> Subhazard, i am not sure how to do that yet
[13:18] <Speljohan_> there's several options
[13:18] <Azathoth> no roofs
[13:18] <Azathoth> or fading rooms
[13:18] <Speljohan_> 1. just dont render roof
[13:18] <Speljohan_> 2. have a "window" opening around player
[13:18] <Speljohan_> or 3:
[13:18] <Speljohan_> fading
[13:19] <Azathoth> i just think not having roofs at all is the best solution
[13:19] <Speljohan_> that is no fun
[13:19] <Azathoth> you're no fun
[13:19] <Speljohan_> forts can be built upwards as well!
[13:19] <Speljohan_> stairs etc
[13:19] <Speljohan_> so it would ruin gameplay
[13:19] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:19] <Azathoth> erm
[13:19] <Azathoth> how do you aim vertically though?
[13:19] <Speljohan_> you don't aim in the z axis
[13:19] <Speljohan_> at all
[13:19] <Azathoth> so...
[13:19] <Speljohan_> forts are mainly for protection
[13:19] <Speljohan_> and throwing grenades!
[13:19] <Azathoth> that's lame
[13:20] <Azathoth> you can't have epic battlements to fire off of?!
[13:20] <Azathoth> starshit troopers style
[13:20] <Azathoth> lame. i'm not playing this shit game
[13:20] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:20] <Speljohan_> focus is on the battlefield
[13:20] <Speljohan_> not the forts
[13:20] <Speljohan_> you can dodge behind objects etc on battlefield
[13:20] <Azathoth> are there vehicles
[13:20] <Speljohan_> possibly in da future
[13:20] <Subhazard> So
[13:20] <Azathoth> there should be pilotable pelicans
[13:20] <Speljohan_> thx for mentioning it
[13:20] <Speljohan_> cus
[13:20] <Azathoth> and warthogs
[13:20] <Subhazard> How do you shoot someone standing on top of a block?
[13:20] <Speljohan_> i hadn't thought about it before
[13:21] <Azathoth> we were just talking about that subhazard ><
[13:21] <Speljohan_> Subhazard you can shoot anyone that is 1 block up
[13:21] <Azathoth> idk speljohan
[13:21] <Speljohan_> da explosives will be most fun tho
[13:21] <Azathoth> i think maybe some kind of auto aim to compensate for elevation differences?
[13:21] <Speljohan_> DESTROY UR ENVIRONMENT
[13:21] <Speljohan_> perhaps Azathoth
[13:22] <Azathoth> but that could prove troublesome if there is a line of different enemies on different levels

[13:23] <Speljohan_> forts will consist of square and rectangular blocks
[13:23] <Speljohan_> wall are rectangular ofc
[13:23] <Speljohan_> ground will be a class heightmap system
[13:23] <Speljohan_> that is deformed by explosions
[13:23] <Azathoth> will ground be deforma....
[13:23] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:23] <Azathoth> dammit, you answered my question before i asked again
[13:23] <Speljohan_> it's so easy to make deformable ground
[13:23] <Speljohan_> so yeah
[13:23] <Speljohan_> i see no reason not to do it
[13:24] <Azathoth> well....
[13:24] <Azathoth> you can get funky results
[13:24] <Speljohan_> and since it isn't an mmo, i don't need to think that much about server software performance
[13:24] <Speljohan_> so a lot can be done
[13:24] <Azathoth> like if an explosion is centered far away from vertices

[14:28] <Speljohan_> or go and play baldur'r gate
[14:28] <Speljohan_> baldur's*
[14:28] <Speljohan_> will keep you occupied for the coming year
[14:31] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[14:31] <Ten_Tacles> Dwarf Fortress is much better.
[14:31] <Speljohan_> sry but baldur's gate wins
[14:31] <Speljohan_> best rpg evar made
[14:31] <Speljohan_> crpg*
[14:32] <Ten_Tacles> Lol
[14:32] <Ten_Tacles> Never played DF huh?
[14:32] <Speljohan_> i have
[14:32] <Ten_Tacles> No.
[14:32] <Speljohan_> it's a completely different type of game anyway
[14:32] <Speljohan_> DF is sandbox more or less
[14:32] <Ten_Tacles> Then you wouldn't speak like that.
[14:32] <Ten_Tacles> Yeah
[14:32] <Speljohan_> bg is a traditional rpg
[14:32] <Ten_Tacles> A funny sandbox
[14:32] <Speljohan_> and i prefer traditional rpg's :P
[14:32] <Ten_Tacles> With carp.
[14:32] <Ten_Tacles> I prefer sandbox :p

[14:34] <Ten_Tacles> Yeah
[14:34] <Speljohan_> sad to see such a potential market turn into north korea
[14:36] <Ten_Tacles> Lol?
[14:36] <Speljohan_> that's what it is Ten_Tacles :P
[14:36] <Ten_Tacles> ...
[14:36] <Ten_Tacles> Lol?
[14:36] <Speljohan_> restricted trading etc
[14:36] <Ten_Tacles> Oh
[14:36] <Ten_Tacles> Yeah
[14:36] <Ten_Tacles> :p
[14:36] <Speljohan_> and of course, forced roles
[14:36] <Speljohan_> :P
[14:36] <Ten_Tacles> Non restricted trading is best.
[14:36] <Speljohan_> yeah
[14:37] <Ten_Tacles> Also, that is true
[14:37] <Speljohan_> if i want to trade my "quest item" let me do so
[14:37] <Ten_Tacles> Forced roles CAN be fun
[14:37] <Speljohan_> it's either my loss or my gain
[14:37] <Ten_Tacles> ^
[14:37] <Speljohan_> but still my choice
[14:37] <Ten_Tacles> Yeah
[14:37] <Ten_Tacles> Like MC :p
[14:37] <Ten_Tacles> Nothing is bound
[14:37] <Speljohan_> xcept MC isn't a mmo :P
[14:37] <Speljohan_> so it doesn't rly count
[14:37] <Ten_Tacles> Not yet :p
[14:37] <Speljohan_> UO probably did it best
[14:38] <Ten_Tacles> UO?
[14:38] <Speljohan_> the amount of thieves/pk's in that game was amazing
[14:38] <Speljohan_> ultima online
[14:38] <Ten_Tacles> :O
[14:38] <Speljohan_> like, going into the "main city" was a risk in itself
[14:38] <Speljohan_> thieves everywhere
[14:38] <Speljohan_> trying to take ur stuff
[14:38] <Speljohan_> lol
[14:38] <Ten_Tacles> XD
[14:38] <Speljohan_> it creates a great market tho
[14:39] <Speljohan_> lots of potential for trading
[14:39] <Ten_Tacles> Yeah
[14:39] <Ten_Tacles> I want a banhammer :D
[14:39] <Speljohan_> :D
[14:39] <Ten_Tacles> As ingame item :D
[14:39] <Speljohan_> atitd is perfect for that
[14:39] <Speljohan_> get voted to become a demipharaoh
[14:39] <Speljohan_> ban someone
[14:39] <Speljohan_> !
[14:39] <Ten_Tacles> Lol

[18:46] <Roadcrosser> hey, if you had the ability to teleport to any location as long as it is in another state in any (or the same) country, what would be the route you would take to play April Fool pranks as much as possible (with time zones)
[18:46] <Drakkar> dicks
[18:46] <Drakkar> and lots of them
[18:47] <Naio> start in australia
[18:47] * Marach (Marach@188-93-163-103.home.aster.pl) has joined #minecraft
[18:47] <Roadcrosser> that would mean you let April 1st 12:00AM to 12:00PM last more than an hour
[18:47] <Naio> and hit as many places as possible while travelling westward
[18:47] <Roadcrosser> i mean 12 hours
[18:48] <Roadcrosser> if each prank has an average carry-out time is 30 mins?
[18:48] <Naio> start 1 hour early in australia
[18:48] <Naio> you can have 2 pranks set up before 12am there
[18:49] <Naio> then at 12am, move west 1 timezone
[18:49] <Naio> set up 2 pranks, when it's 12am THERE, move west again
[18:52] <Vicrry> I'd teleport west as fast as possible. That way, you keep going backwards a day over the date line and it's ALWAYS April 1st
[18:53] <Naio> yeah, uh, that'll work. totally. [/sarcasm]

[21:39] <blaster> But still, I think video game addiction is a load of shit, how can you get addicted to something which isn't chemical
[21:39] <Ten_Tacles> You can get addicted to EVERYTHING
[21:40] <Ten_Tacles> Really, everything that causes emotions.
[21:40] <Ten_Tacles> And that is EVERYTHING
[21:40] <MPeti> Not that much away :P
[21:40] <blaster> Except dieing, which has a serious lack of emotion
[21:40] <MPeti> lol
[21:40] <Ten_Tacles> Exactly
[21:40] <Konogan> Yup.
[21:40] <Ten_Tacles> Blaster, but thats the only thing :p
[21:41] <MPeti> lemme think of something else... ;D
[21:41] <Konogan> I conclude dieing is neither good nor bad then.
[21:41] <JTE> What are you talking about, I'm notorious for my random addictions to dying repeatedly because it has such an emotional response when somebody keeps causing me to die..
[21:41] <Konogan> :P
[21:41] <blaster> But there is a difference between addiction and 'like playing it so much that I forget to eat and die'. Addiction is when your brain chemicaly craves something.
[21:41] <vurtual> or like
[21:41] <vurtual> That game is very fun, and you want to play it all the time.
[21:41] <MPeti> Breathing! You don't get addicted to that, you just have to xD
[21:41] <Quatroking> ffffff
[21:41] <vurtual> oh no guys
[21:42] <vurtual> I think I'm addicted.

[21:42] <Quatroking> I just ran out of pickaxes
[21:42] <vurtual> It feels so good, and no matter how hard I try, I can't stop.

[21:45] <vurtual> a dwarf can get a mood, which is like SUDDENLY, I HAVE THIS AWESOME IDEA.

[22:06] <Speljohan_> ur wrong here sppt
[22:06] <Speljohan_> "There is a good deal of misinformation on the Internet regarding the backup/archival copy exception. It is not a "second copy" rule and is often mistakenly cited for the proposition that if you have one lawful copy of a copyrighted work, you are entitled to have a second copy of the copyrighted work even if that second copy is an infringing copy. The backup/archival copy exception is a very narrow limitation relating to a copy being made by the
[22:06] <Speljohan_> rightful owner of an authentic game to ensure he or she has one in the event of damage or destruction of the authentic. Therefore, whether you have an authentic game or not, or whether you have possession of a Nintendo ROM for a limited amount of time, i.e. 24 hours, it is illegal to download and play a Nintendo ROM from the Internet."

[22:17] <vurtual> Yeah, and?
[22:17] <Speljohan_> from long gone companies
[22:17] <vurtual> Does it make it right to just take it?
[22:17] <Speljohan_> so, what if someone wants that title?
[22:17] <vurtual> If they'r really "long gone", and there's nobody owning it, chances are it's probably public domain or something.
[22:17] <Speljohan_> nope
[22:17] <Speljohan_> because
[22:17] <vurtual> or check a used game store.
[22:17] <Speljohan_> nintendo had sum dum shit back in da 80's

[23:20] <Marach> because malloc returns void*

[23:20] <Yourself> and C++ won't let you

[23:38] <Ten_Tacles> You'd think that complete lockdown is a good solution to a siege, but although a dwarven fortress may appear self-contained and fully functional, your dwarves have nothing to do but get moody, lash out at a world which doesn't understand their needs, get hammered, throw funeral receptions, conduct grief counseling sessions, and perform the occasional keg stand.
[23:38] <Ten_Tacles> In short, the attacking army can simply wait until your dwarves emo themselves to death.
