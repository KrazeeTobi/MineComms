[0:34] <bildramer> ...
[0:34] <bildramer> you hadn't played HL2?
[0:34] <Snowman> Cause you suck at them
[0:34] <Marach> it just started out boring
[0:35] <bildramer> "boring" as in "fucking epic story"
[0:35] <Jat> i found hl2 rather boring
[0:35] <Marach> there isn't much of a story. just walking between places where people are like OMG IT'S FREEMAN
[0:35] <Jat> hl1 was much more interesting
[0:35] <Snowman> There's plenty of story
[0:36] <Marach> if there is, then it's damn slow
[0:36] <Jat> i have yet to finish episode 1 or 2
[0:36] <Jat> also i hate alyx
[0:36] <Jat> so much
[0:36] <bildramer> http://onethingtosee.com/what-its-like-to-drive-on-a-dubai-highway/

[0:37] <Marach> lol
[0:37] <AndrewPH> Marach, the story's there, they just don't force it in your face like some developers.
[0:37] <Snowman> She doesn't
[0:37] <Marach> i do read the text
[0:37] <bildramer> dammit don't ruin it snowman
[0:37] <Marach> ha
[0:38] <Snowman> Someone else dies
[0:38] <Marach> snowman gave the REAL spoiler
[0:38] <Snowman> Random Rebel #14
[0:38] <Marach> i knew bildramer can be either telling the truth or lying
[0:38] <Snowman> Vortigaunt #3
[0:38] <Snowman> 58x Combine Soldier

[0:38] <bildramer> "Whoa this is what I call extreme tongue piercing"
[0:39] <bildramer> http://i.imgur.com/0O8bN.jpg nsfw extreme imagery
[0:39] <Marach> imagine playing hl2 as your very first "modern" fps
[0:39] <bildramer> <Marach> i knew bildramer can be either telling the truth or lying
[0:39] <bildramer> derp herp?
[0:39] <Marach> true
[0:39] <Snowman> He has a mouthful
[0:39] <Snowman> OH THAT SLAPS ME ON THE KNEE
[0:40] <Marach> everything keeps amazing me
[0:40] <Miclee> There's a vid of that pic, bildramer.
[0:40] <Marach> ie. how the hell a game with that graphics runs on my pc
[0:41] <Marach> *uncomfortable silence*
[0:41] * Mithril (Mithril2@e54013.upc-e.chello.nl) Quit (Quit: Quit)
[0:41] <bildramer> :l
[0:42] <Yourself> Marach, the source engine was ahead of its time when it came out
[0:42] <Yourself> it's a bit dated now
[0:42] <Marach> i don't really care :D
[0:42] <Marach> games don't age
[0:42] <Yourself> i want episode 3
[0:42] <Snowman> Who doesn't?
[0:42] <Dommys> I don't
[0:42] <Yourself> Jat, apparently
[0:43] <Jat> what?
[0:43] <Snowman> Dommys, yes you do
[0:43] <Jat> oh yeah
[0:43] <Snowman> Don't lie
[0:43] <vurtual> "a bit" dated?
[0:43] <Dommys> Not really.
[0:43] <vurtual> Really?
[0:43] <Marach> i don't, but i probably will when i beat ep1 and 2
[0:43] <Jat> i liked hl1 a lot
[0:43] <vurtual> it's neither.
[0:43] <Jat> but
[0:43] <Jat> i was somewhat disappointed with hl2 and kind of lost interest in the series
[0:43] <vurtual> half-life 2's getting a bit "dated" now
[0:43] <vurtual> Episode Two is no longer a graphical mindblow
[0:43] <Snowman> Cause it's 2 years old
[0:44] <vurtual> But portal 2 may just be many times better.
[0:44] <bildramer> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on6BSfHlK_w
[0:44] <bildramer> lol
[0:44] <Marach> vurtual: speak for yourself
[0:44] <Yourself> i don't know, ever since i've seen the graphics in GTA IV...
[0:44] <vurtual> Also, the apparent wave of people starting to finally have to upgrade because they can't run episode two or garrys mod and now more games are coming out thing, that'll probably mean we don't have sprite-trees in our face!
[0:44] <Visiiri> We're all living in Amerika
[0:44] <Visiiri> Amerika
[0:44] <Visiiri> it's wondurbar
[0:44] <Miclee> RDR > GTAIV
[0:44] <Yourself> haven't played RDR
[0:44] <Marach> i hate gta.
[0:45] <Yourself> i'm sure it's fucking beautiful
[0:45] <Yourself> but so is GTA IV
[0:45] <Visiiri> The only GTA that was good was Vice City
[0:45] <Yourself> the shadows are what really won me over
[0:45] <Yourself> graphics-wise
[0:45] <Miclee> RDR is incredible.
[0:45] * Cue (cueball61@cpc4-alde1-0-0-cust997.glfd.cable.ntl.com) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[0:45] <Visiiri> RDR?
[0:45] <Miclee> I only wish I could take screenshots
[0:45] <Visiiri> TBH, Minecraft has AMAZING graphics
[0:45] <bildramer> good thing with long dev times is you can add features and hardware can keep up
[0:45] <vurtual> Just Cause 2 wins graphics forever btw
[0:45] <Visiiri> Even for low rez, the pixel shaders?
[0:45] <Visiiri> win
[0:45] <Marach> let's talk about games for machines i actually have
[0:45] <bildramer> lol
[0:45] <Visiiri> Not really, loads of games are better than JC2
[0:46] <Visiiri> Even ME2 is better.
[0:46] <vurtual> even on all-low 1280x1024 on a monitor built for 1650x1280, it still looks great.
[0:46] <Visiiri> Hell, AC2 is better
[0:46] <vurtual> dem sunsets.
[0:46] <Visiiri> I can't stand the damn tree rendering
[0:46] <Visiiri> . . .
[0:46] <Visiiri> to
[0:46] <Marach> well, i don't play new games and hl2 graphics are still epic for me
[0:46] <Visiiri> . . . .
[0:46] <Visiiri> to ......
[0:46] <vurtual> driving through lush forest in a jeep.
[0:46] <Miclee> Red Dead Redemption is incredible when you see a sunrise behind a hill and it slowly is coming up, you see the shadows, etc. everywhere changing.
[0:46] <Miclee> It's epic.
[0:46] <vurtual> also I'm pretty sure you could turn up the rendering distance somehow
[0:46] <vurtual> just, nobody ever bothers.
[0:47] <Miclee> JC2 isn't incredible graphics.
[0:47] <Visiiri> Tbh, GTAIV has better graphics
[0:47] <Visiiri> Like, graphic wise
[0:47] <Miclee> Mhm
[0:47] <Visiiri> not really aesthetic wise, however
[0:47] <Marach> i'm EXACTLY like this guy. http://xkcd.com/606/

[2:06] <blaster> And mothers die during child birth because babys heads are so fucking huge

[2:17] <gdude2002> Correct.
[2:17] <blaster> Whatever the bible is a bunch of FICTIONAL STORIES
[2:17] <Kodaichi> brb
[2:17] <vurtual> the bible has some fictional stories in it actually.
[2:17] <gdude2002> blaster: they could be true but there's no proof that they are.
[2:17] <vurtual> like, where the one guy is like "well let me tell you a story"
[2:17] <vurtual> and then it serves as an analogy
[2:17] <whatever> blaster : ok so, explain how did jesus resurected?

[3:50] <gordenfreechmen> so when they'd ask something, i'd walk in front of them and say random shit

[3:50] <vurtual> yeah that's pretty common
[3:51] <gordenfreechmen> combat was probably what lost me after exploring just a small bit
[3:51] <vurtual> also lulz are to be had when you discover you can walk around pantsless.
[3:51] <Yourself> there's a tutorial island in runescape?
[3:51] <vurtual> yes there is
[3:51] <Yourself> man, it's been a long time
[3:51] <blaster> Not any more
[3:51] <blaster> They replaced it with a tutorial quest
[3:52] <blaster> That has voiceovers
[3:52] <vurtual> ahahaha really?
[3:52] <gordenfreechmen> that kind of makes it more annoying
[3:52] <blaster> And released a new skill for non members
[3:52] <gordenfreechmen> considering "oh boy, im ready to click and kill a bunch of ogres!"
[3:52] <blaster> The new skill is fairly interesting
[3:52] <gordenfreechmen> "no, fuck that, go run around here and find ye flask"
[3:52] <vurtual> get ye flask
[3:52] <blaster> And might work in minecraft

[3:53] <vurtual> Flask, or maiden?
[3:53] <vurtual> flask
[3:53] <Yourself> last time i played runescape there were just those two big cities
[3:53] <vurtual> oh no a squad of sabateur
[3:53] <Yourself> and a smaller one to the south next to a desert or som shit
[3:53] <gordenfreechmen> vurtual: i made a huge sand and gravel text that said "GET YE FLASK" in minecraft, then had it fall with realistic sand physics on, which lagged the server for 5 minutes
[3:53] <gordenfreechmen> it was funny
[3:53] <vurtual> yeee flaaask
[3:53] <blaster> Yourself
[3:53] <vurtual> make a ye flask puzzle
[3:53] <Yourself> and if you wanted to PvP or fight really tough monsters you just kept going north
[3:53] <blaster> Thats the free player map
[3:53] <vurtual> remove ye flask, sand support falls
[3:53] <vurtual> sand floor falls
[3:53] <vurtual> you sink into magma

[3:54] <vurtual> room regens, you lose ye flask
[3:54] <gordenfreechmen> i made a few indev puzzles based purely on knowledge
[3:54] <gordenfreechmen> in example, outrunning water which kills torches
[3:54] <gordenfreechmen> which caves you in
[3:54] <gordenfreechmen> and if you try to escape, lava falls
[3:55] <gordenfreechmen> you have to get the farthest away from the water you release
[3:55] <Yourself> 250 MB done, 630 to go
[3:55] <gordenfreechmen> get out, then you use the sand as a stair to the new puzzle
[3:55] <blaster> Gordenfreechmen how about a room which becomes dark
[3:55] <blaster> traps the player in
[3:55] <blaster> And the only way out is to let lava set fire to a wooden door
[3:55] <vurtual> how about a room that becomes light
[3:55] <vurtual> releasing light into the room

[3:56] <gordenfreechmen> blaster: one of the puzzles was trusting to wade into lava or attempt a jump
[3:56] <vurtual> then you have to force a light update on a block using tricky puzzles, which makes it physics.
[3:56] <gordenfreechmen> if you havent played indev you'd think lava kills instantly
[3:56] <vurtual> wear gold armor
[3:56] <vurtual> be magmaproof
[3:57] <blaster> Is gold armor actualy magmaproof
[3:57] <Yourself> it shouldn't be
[3:57] <Yourself> gold is a soft metal
[3:57] <gordenfreechmen> i gave notch the idea of magmaproof obsidian armor, he said he liked the idea
[3:57] <vurtual> it isn't
[3:57] <vurtual> but all armor shields similarly
[3:57] <vurtual> gold just wears out superfast.
[3:58] <vurtual> so it's relatively useful for things like anti-magma
[3:58] <Yourself> gold melts at 1337.33 K
[3:58] <blaster> soft =/= low melting point

[4:22] <vurtual> link

[4:22] <vurtual> the thread
[4:22] <Animator> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?p=216849#p216849
[4:22] <blaster> Oh
[4:22] <vurtual> if it's what I'm thinking of...
[4:22] <Animator> That's my post.
[4:23] <Animator> It's very long.
[4:23] <Animator> I'm very meticulous when it comes to how I want to kill people, really.
[4:24] <vurtual> Animator, your first idea sucks.
[4:24] <vurtual> TNT is pretty discernable from creepers
[4:24] <vurtual> it's easy to catch soemone working
[4:24] * sppt (i@ip545125db.direct-adsl.nl) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[4:24] <Animator> Hm.
[4:24] <vurtual> You'll be emotionally vulnerable
[4:24] <vurtual> And lastly, how will you carry everything?
[4:24] <Animator> I could skip the TNT part.
[4:24] * Rens2Sea (Rens2Sea@s55929463.adsl.wanadoo.nl) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[4:24] * Cial would heard a bunch of creepers under some ones house and run
[4:24] <Animator> Also, I'll carry it in inventory. It won't be -everything-.
[4:25] <Animator> Just the important stuff. Iron, Coal, food, weapons, tools.
[4:25] <Animator> And maybe some rocks.
[4:25] <vurtual> also, lastly
[4:25] <vurtual> you'll probably get PKed
[4:25] <Animator> PKed?
[4:25] <vurtual> someone will kill YOU
[4:26] <vurtual> Anyways my idea is better.
[4:26] <vurtual> Control half the world with companies that are fronts for my world domiantion.
[4:26] <Animator> Not unless I play the move first.
[4:26] <vurtual> I will cause immense collaboration.
[4:26] <Animator> Hm. Clan manipulation sounds like a good idea, actually.
[4:27] <vurtual> Everybody will secretly work directly under me, assuming my control over them is individual, giving them power for serving.
[4:27] <vurtual> Anything important, I can do myself.
[4:27] <Animator> But what if the people decide to go against you?
[4:27] <vurtual> I cut them down
[4:27] <Animator> And if they outnumber you?
[4:27] <vurtual> or just kick them out
[4:27] <vurtual> Or just not use them.
[4:28] <Animator> And decide to kill you?
[4:28] <vurtual> "No way man I'm not gonna help you."
[4:28] <vurtual> "Okay fine, continue doing your dayjob."
[4:28] <vurtual> Then give them absolute nightmare.
[4:28] <vurtual> Need to assassinate an enemy ruler? Have there be some roadwork, pose as a construction worker, and set up a trap.
[4:28] <vurtual> If I really get enough control, I could probably do everything "for the people", and be very out there.
[4:29] <vurtual> then again I'm not really going to have much power from that kind of decentralized government
[4:29] <Animator> So you're suggesting a giant, seemingly-legitamite mafia that represents the ideals of the people?
[4:29] <vurtual> no, secretly creating and controlling many, many clans/companies/groups
[4:29] <vurtual> who don't even know I control them
[4:30] <Animator> And how do you plan on controlling them?
[4:30] <vurtual> Because I'll actually be head of all of them.
[4:30] <Animator> The only way I could imagine you doing so is hosting their servers.
[4:30] <vurtual> There'll be a CEO, but he'll be some fat guy who just listens to me.
[4:30] <vurtual> Except instead of blackmail, it's reverse-blackmail.
[4:30] <vurtual> instead of risking going below 0, you're risking not ever going over 0
[4:31] <vurtual> and not actually being disagreeable will help.
[4:31] <Animator> First off, clans are shaky as it is. Controlling them is like controlling multiple stacks of dominoes, and you're barely in them anyway.
[4:31] <blaster> I have a plan for a city in multiplayer survival
[4:31] <Animator> It can be done.
[4:31] <blaster> That could work
[4:31] <Animator> But it would take some time worming into them.
[4:32] <Animator> And that's -if- they haven't disintegrated completely.
[4:32] <Yourself> i think clans are silly
[4:32] <vurtual> I have a good amount of experience secretly controlling everything.
[4:32] <vurtual> I do it irl all the time.
[4:32] * blaster (heliduels@78.150.6.78) Quit (Quit: Died)
[4:33] <Animator> I mean, I'm technically in all clans that can have, and will form in the future for the sake of keeping them in line.
[4:33] <vurtual> Besides, I start them.
[4:33] <Yourself> and now for other things no one asked me about: my goldeneye source download is now complete
[4:33] <vurtual> My trained agents will do the actual physical work.
[4:33] <vurtual> just like irl
[4:33] <Animator> Now you're just being silly.
[4:33] <vurtual> No, really.
[4:33] <Animator> Mmhm.
[4:33] <Animator> And I'm Jean-Claude Van Damme.
[4:33] <vurtual> The only problem is getting all my best buddies in the whole espionage thing to actually play.
[4:34] <vurtual> Or just pick them out of the crow.
[4:34] <vurtual> d
[4:34] <Animator> That's your biggest problem. They could always turn on you as well and talk behind your back when you're not watching.
[4:34] <Animator> Unless you keep reccords on their conversations.
[4:35] <vurtual> Already accounted for that.
[4:35] <Dragoon_Jett> Golden Eye is an awful game.
[4:35] <vurtual> Lying to me is already hard.
[4:35] <vurtual> Dragoon_Jett is trolling
[4:35] <vurtual> actually no he's just got some raged opinion against it
[4:35] <vurtual> from a bad experience.
[4:35] <vurtual> and wishes to vent this
[4:36] <Yourself> cool story, bro
[4:36] * Varriount is now known as Vgor
[4:36] <Animator> And then they have to actually be competent enough to be agents.
[4:36] <vurtual> I can pick that out of the crowd, too.
[4:36] <Animator> The agents could worm themselves into clans and run it from your commands.
[4:37] <Animator> Or you choose people already inside clans and make them agents.
[4:37] <vurtual> That'd be a bad idea.
[4:37] <Animator> But that's more risky.
[4:37] <vurtual> They already have affiliation
[4:37] <vurtual> and probably emotion, if they started a clan
[4:37] <vurtual> and knowing clanpeople here, also dumb
[4:37] <vurtual> Secondly, "worming in" is a bad idea also.
[4:37] <Animator> Oh?
[4:37] <Animator> Oh wait, yeah.
[4:38] <Animator> It wouldn't sit right with the person who started the clan.
[4:38] <Animator> Then it all gets messy and I end up cleaning that up.

[5:16] <Visiiri> He was doing illegal actions under my name
[5:16] <TrueWolves> Wasn't 100% expecting to get this far, but I'll do my best to keep the channel rules and all that.
[5:17] <vurtual> It's okay TrueWolves, you'll end up like me eventually.
[5:17] <TrueWolves> I may not be activly talking in the channel, but if I'm logged on, you can PM me and that'll ping me.
[5:17] <vurtual> Speak disappointedly, and carry a big stick.
[5:17] <Visiiri> TrueWolves: If you ever need help, just OP me. I'll ban a few people and take the blame
[5:18] <TrueWolves> That blame would fall back on me, even if only mentaly, so sorry... >.>

[5:18] <vurtual> My birthday is in June
[5:19] <Visiiri> lol
[5:19] <TrueWolves> XD
[5:20] <vurtual> also I'm more like l4d bill than "creepy-old-man.jpg"
[5:21] <Visiiri> >Just admitted he was a guy
[5:21] <vurtual> more like
[5:21] <vurtual> as in, between the two, closer to bill
[5:21] <vurtual> Besides, I may actually be a guy.
[5:22] <vurtual> Doesn't matter much on the internet though, because that has zero influence over who I am.
[5:22] <Visiiri> Lies
[5:22] <Visiiri> I am the internets
[5:22] <Visiiri> and I see your testicals
[5:22] <vurtual> Also, for a moment I thought this basic saying-it-plainly was enough
[5:22] <Rooster> What the hell is going on
[5:22] <vurtual> but you're so oblivious that you can't take something as anything besides an aboslute.
[5:22] <Visiiri> Correct.
[5:23] <Visiiri> I'm also a jackass at times.
[5:23] <Visiiri> I even griefed blaster's server with swastikas today.
[5:23] <Visiiri> I should die.
[5:23] <Visiiri> :(
[5:23] <Rooster> lol
[5:24] <vurtual> you know, I remember this keyboard cat guy
[5:24] <vurtual> he placed red swastikas around a server
[5:24] <vurtual> everywhere, constantly
[5:24] <vurtual> he never admitted it, acted calm
[5:24] <vurtual> it was absolutely hillarious
[5:24] <Visiiri> Was that before minecraft started sucking?
[5:24] <vurtual> So basically I spent all day with this other guy, just finding and removing them. It was better than sitting around and doing nothing.
[5:24] <Visiiri> Or was he flying around?
[5:24] <vurtual> it was back when hacks were first invented
[5:24] <Visiiri> Ah
[5:24] <vurtual> He was never seen flying.
[5:24] <Visiiri> CPColin was the only creator then
[5:25] <vurtual> the other guy did use 'em
[5:25] <Visiiri> I remember
[5:25] <Visiiri> On my first server
[5:25] <vurtual> I remember a guy speedily bouncing around the server
[5:25] <vurtual> with our various names
[5:25] <Visiiri> We had an op that started a HUGE building
[5:25] <vurtual> I wasn't an op then, and at one point a guy said it was me.
[5:25] <Visiiri> When it was finished, I realized that it was a HUGE penis
[5:25] * Firetempest (Mibbit@adsl-235-74-149.clt.bellsouth.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:25] <vurtual> except I was with everyone else, working
[5:26] <vurtual> well, sitting in the lame top tower of my submarine.
[5:26] <Visiiri> Minecraft needs sandstone
[5:26] <Visiiri> And half blocks of sandstone
[5:26] <Visiiri> and horizontal half blocks
[5:26] <vurtual> Whenever someone griefed it, I just rebuilt it, exactly was before, but with a new interior, always being better.
[5:26] <Visiiri> I miss that minecraft.
[5:26] <vurtual> swastikas didn't quite fit on it.
[5:27] <Visiiri> Things were actually cool then
[5:27] <vurtual> too bad nobody spammed russian symbols.
[5:27] <Visiiri> My very favourite server- I cannot remember what it was called
[5:27] <Rooster> Minecraft needs a content update Baaad
[5:27] <Rooster> I demand boats and fishing
[5:27] <vurtual> heeheehee, interrogating someone with a LASER
[5:27] <vurtual> This is less interrogation and more laser.
[5:27] <Visiiri> Well, it was totally amazing
[5:27] <Visiiri> We just built roads and built things
[5:27] <vurtual> Visiiri, did it have a tag at the beginning of the name?
[5:28] <Visiiri> I think so.
[5:28] <Visiiri> But I cannot recall.
[5:28] <vurtual> ...was it all water?
[5:28] <Visiiri> No sir
[5:28] <Firetempest> maybe just a key shortcut to lay a half block horizontal or vertical rather then two separate items
[5:28] <Visiiri> I built a huge gold tower
[5:28] <Visiiri> then dug to the ground
[5:28] <vurtual> hmm
[5:28] <vurtual> then it wasn't that one
[5:28] <Visiiri> and made a rainbow slide in the middle
[5:28] <vurtual> I do recognize the structure concept
[5:28] <vurtual> You sure you weren't on some all-water server?
[5:28] * tentacos (Lep@nr29-216-196-139-1.fuse.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)

[5:30] <Visiiri> No hacks, no custom servers
[5:30] <TrueWolves> That was my first "home" server
[5:30] * Mosslander (Mosslander@c-71-231-163-229.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[5:30] <TrueWolves> and what inspired me to make a "Tree Build" server that became Yggdrasil
[5:30] <vurtual> Redshift stole all the glory :(
[5:30] <vurtual> I mean seriously we were like, being an awesome server, inventing watervators
[5:31] <vurtual> and then boom, red shift's shows up, and our server sinks into the mist over time.
[5:31] <vurtual> Didn't help that there were massive stone structures to protect ridiculous buildings.
[5:31] <vurtual> I warned them, and they blew it all up! They blew it all uuuup!
[5:31] <Visiiri> Hmmmmm
[5:31] <vede> Visiiri, I agree.
[5:31] <vede> That's why I have my server.
[5:32] <Visiiri> Do you think there's a way to convince Notch to get rid of all of that?
[5:32] <AzureAngelic> i don't mean to be barging in on you guys but i need advice
[5:32] <vede> I think he already wants to.
[5:32] <Visiiri> I remember one server that had really tall buildings
[5:32] <vede> Azure, okay.
[5:32] <Visiiri> and sky bridges
[5:32] <Visiiri> and then I found Moltar's Gay Server
[5:32] <AzureAngelic> i need some good ds games

[5:33] <Rooster> Vede has a good server
[5:34] <Visiiri> vede, you should make your next map a normal generation
[5:34] <vurtual> with just an initial admin stone platform that's extra tiny
[5:34] * ylt (youliketha@92.18.180.206) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)

[5:34] <Visiiri> With something Unicorn
[5:35] <Visiiri> [Ican'tremember]Unicorn was the OP
[5:35] <Visiiri> Me and ddoggx made huge castles in the corner
[5:35] <Visiiri> And I made pikmin sprites

[5:44] <Cial> <Kraffslola> Hi there, fanboy. He's taken money off people, and has been building a game, profiting from his promise of multiplayer. Now he's 'unmotivated' suddenly it's come to a halt, even though he's making tons of money, and has enough motivation play through fucking videogames, and go out and buy macs, move into a brand new apartment with his moneygrubbing girlfrien

[6:37] <Adurah> CSS isn't a programming language.

[6:37] <Rooster> Yes
[6:37] <Yourself> also not a programming language
[6:38] <Rooster> *facepalm?*
[6:38] <Yourself> but it has models and textures and other such resources that gmod "needs"
[6:38] <vurtual> ...
[6:38] <vurtual> yeah

[8:18] <Animator> The other developers are like, "No, no, he's lying" but then again, this is clone1018 we're talking here.
[8:18] <vurtual> no no last I read
[8:19] <vurtual> he did the physics, and some other stuff
[8:19] <vurtual> and the other stuff was rewritten
[8:19] <vurtual> but the physics weren't
[8:19] <Animator> So I'm giving him an opportunity to prove it to me, or at least do something legitimate.
[8:19] <Animator> If he doesn't, even after I've been so nice and soft, well...
[8:19] <Animator> He's going in the cellar with the rest.
[8:19] <vurtual> When given an opportunity to have someone they percieve as remotely friendly go nice on them, they seek shelter
[8:20] <vurtual> When given an opportunity to have soemone they percieve as a roadblock go nice on them, they rant.
[8:20] <LuciferZ> Animator, Animator! Be proud of me!
[8:20] <vurtual> and try to fruitlesly chew you down
[8:20] <LuciferZ> I had the opportunity to troll the everliving shit out of ShadowDusk
[8:20] <vurtual> Generally at that point you should mush them into soft, mushy mashed potatoes
[8:20] <LuciferZ> But I didn't! :D
[8:21] * Animator hugs LuciferZ.
[8:21] <Animator> Attaboy.
[8:21] <vurtual> troll
[8:21] <vurtual> or flame?
[8:21] <Animator> That's being the bigger man.
[8:21] <LuciferZ> Both.
[8:21] <LuciferZ> Troll first but then flame
[8:21] <vurtual> no no trolling is not flaming, but trying to start a flamewar.
[8:21] <LuciferZ> I get satisfaction from both
[8:21] <vurtual> never ever should it be followed by flaming
[8:21] <LuciferZ> And flaming is less work.
[8:21] <vurtual> except by other people
[8:22] <vurtual> who you were trolling
[8:22] <LuciferZ> So usually I troll until I get bored and then I flame instead.
[8:22] <vurtual> Then you quietly smile and leave after a bit
[8:22] <vurtual> you aren't trolling then, you are a dishonor and failure to the art of trolling.
[8:23] <LuciferZ> There's not really a art to it.
[8:23] <vurtual> Yes there is.
[8:23] <LuciferZ> Not really. It's simple shit.
[8:23] <vurtual> I have more experience than you have years lived.
[8:23] <LuciferZ> It's basically sarcasm evolved.
[8:23] <vurtual> nnot really.
[8:23] <vurtual> Someday, young padawan, but not now.
[8:23] <LuciferZ> Yeah really.
[8:23] <vurtual> naaaah
[8:24] <LuciferZ> Anyone can troll
[8:24] <LuciferZ> And sure, not everyone can troll well
[8:24] <LuciferZ> But it's not some exclusive Jedi council.
[8:24] <vurtual> No, more exclsive like "force users" exclusive
[8:24] <LuciferZ> Not even that. It's like
[8:25] <vurtual> Takes lots and lots of practice and sadism to troll worth your butts.
[8:25] <LuciferZ> "People who can use a keyboard and can occasionally be witty"
[8:25] <LuciferZ> "moderately intelligent internet users" exclusive
[8:26] <vurtual> Sure, you can try to grasp at this "trolling" goal, some faded and barely-known concept.
[8:26] <vurtual> But unless you really know what you're doing, you'll be nowhere near there.
[8:26] <LuciferZ> Vurtual, it's okay. It's okay. I know what I'm doing. You don't have to be better.
[8:27] <vurtual> It'll be like some really dumb guy trying to "drive", and then he just runs in a straight line off a cliff, assuming it's driving.
[8:27] <vurtual> I mean, drivers are going forwards, right? They're getting places.
[8:27] <EmpiresBane> oh shit! no wonder my contoler wasn't working! i had it plugged into the ethernet port
[8:27] <vurtual> And hey there's that flying thing people do, and that's like driving a bit, so you'd best get some of THAT done.
[8:27] <vurtual> wheeeeeee...
[8:27] <vurtual> splt.
[8:28] <EmpiresBane> oh the irony of you two...
[8:29] <vurtual> anyways, 007 music is really good for building evil bases-ENTIRELY NORMAL HUTS
[8:31] <vurtual> Not that I'm implying that you should come onto this server that has "433444" in the URL, but this could be bigger with more than one person working on it.
[8:32] <vurtual> also I have all the rooms awkwardly disconnected, with no kind of link between them, so it's daunting.
[8:32] <yoshibot_squeeze> got minecraft to work! <3
[8:33] <Animator> Seems that the MCSharp thread is now silent.
[8:33] <vurtual> fun keybind of the day: ctrl+f
[8:33] <yoshibot_squeeze> sort of.
[8:33] <yoshibot_squeeze> openjdk's plugin doesnt seem to be running lwjgl well
[8:33] <vurtual> I don't use openjdk
[8:33] <vurtual> I use the normal java
[8:33] <yoshibot_squeeze> i tried that, but it wouldnt run
[8:34] <vurtual> Animator, you use too many words.
[8:34] <vurtual> there should be a reply in 2015 when they finally finish comprehending a whole paragraph!
[8:35] <Animator> But there's only 1 paragraph in that response...
[8:35] <Animator> And a couple of added lines.
[8:36] <vurtual> Yeah, but they'll be all confused-like.
[8:37] <LuciferZ> Haha
[8:37] * LuciferZ bro fist bumps Animator
[8:37] <LuciferZ> I'll delete YOU.

[8:53] <Kodaichi> I'm listening to this song called radium - renegade returns
[8:53] <Kodaichi> my cat doesn't like it, lol
[8:53] <vurtual> One of my dogs likes the twilight princess zora's domain theme.
[8:53] <vurtual> makes them relax
[8:54] <vede> It's a bit disappointing in its... normalcy, though.
[8:54] <Kodaichi> oh cool
[8:54] <Kodaichi> I kinda like that midna song, even though it's even more depressing
[8:54] <TkTech> Animator: Ping
[8:54] <Kodaichi> the rainy one
[8:55] <Animator> Hello.
[8:55] <Animator> Also, that wasn't a ping, that was good timing.
[8:55] <EmpiresBane> yes!
[8:56] <Animator> I have no highlights. They never work for some reason...
[8:56] <EmpiresBane> my mom gave me her credit card meaning she didn't see what i'm buying!
[8:56] <TkTech> Animator: If you observe the header present in the actual MCSharp source code, it does state its released under an open source educational licensce

[8:56] <TkTech> Pfft. There's your problem.
[8:56] <yoshibot_squeeze> specifically configured not to?
[8:56] <TkTech> mIRC is a garbage client
[8:56] <yoshibot_squeeze> by default mIRC does that
[8:56] <EmpiresBane> by the way... i wasn't buying porn...
[8:56] <yoshibot_squeeze> use xchat. :3
[8:57] <Kodaichi> empiresbane: why not
[8:57] <TkTech> The toy scripting language in it is appalling as well
[8:57] <TkTech> Yes, use XChat or YChat (The free windows build)
[8:57] <Kodaichi> aww jesus
[8:57] <Animator> As for that, I'll see how the MCSharp thing goes down.

[8:58] <Animator> Lemme guess, TKTech, you're talking to Neko_Baron on the coalition channel.
[8:58] <TkTech> Animator: MCSharp was currently migrating to an open source license and all of the files have already been modified in the repp to include the license. He technically hasn't violated anything at all by releasing it, although the whole revenge thing I'm not floating with

[8:59] <EmpiresBane> my mom would flip out if she saw that title
[8:59] <TkTech> Animator: http://code.mccoalition.net/projects/mcsharp
[9:00] <Dommys> I'm just teasing a bit. Pretty tense in there, I noticed. ;P
[9:00] <Animator> Hm. Then who is the sole owner of the source code of MCSharp?
[9:00] * PirateJesus (Mibbit@adsl-147-172-34.sdf.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[9:00] <TkTech> No one.
[9:00] <Dommys> Your mom would be ok with you getting Porn, but not a game called Killing floor???
[9:00] <TkTech> Kakashi, descention, copyboy, and a couple of others all contributed parts
[9:00] <TkTech> as well as Neko
[9:01] * Parthon (cheeeese@godsta.arach.net.au) has joined #minecraft
[9:01] <TkTech> However, in its current state, MCSharp is actually illegal, it uses many components of MonoTorrent without attribution
[9:01] <TkTech> Which they've been informed of and are hopefully in the process of fixing
[9:01] <EmpiresBane> Dommys, my mom would probably have a heart attack if i baught porn with her credit card
[9:01] <Animator> No one? Then why the hell is clone1018 stopping them from releasing it?
[9:01] <Aeomin> MonoTorrent o.O
[9:01] <Animator> I see.
[9:01] <TkTech> MCSharp itself is a derivative of copyboy's original Obsidian server
[9:01] <TkTech> Which was released as public domain
[9:01] <Dommys> EB, who buys porn these days anyways? other than old men who don't know how to work internet magic? (google...)
[9:01] <Animator> So it's free to begin with.
[9:02] <TkTech> Bingo.
[9:02] <Animator> Well goddamn.
[9:02] <Animator> Now I feel bad for wiping out Neko_Baron's signature.
[9:02] <TkTech> I'm not happy with any of them
[9:02] <TkTech> But their lead dev is 13 years old
[9:02] <Dommys> Don't feel bad for doing your job, Ani
[9:02] <EmpiresBane> what was his sig?
[9:03] <Aeomin> Animator had no choice there though
[9:03] <TkTech> No, Neko should not be on a revenge quest.
[9:03] <Animator> It had the MCSharp link.
[9:03] <Yourself> <TkTech> But their lead dev is 13 years old
[9:03] <Yourself> they're going places
[9:03] <Animator> So, just to get this straight. MCSharp is still illegal, but not for the reasons I think it is.
[9:03] <Azathoth> guys
[9:03] <Azathoth> does anyone fucking play railworks?
[9:03] <vurtual> why
[9:03] <Kodaichi> My mom would have a heart attack if i bought porn with my /own/ credit card.
[9:03] <TkTech> Animator: Neko is not handling this the best way he could have and a flame war should be stopped at your discretion.
[9:03] <Azathoth> or its 50 bajillion addons
[9:03] <EmpiresBane> is 3rd party server discussion banned on the forums?
[9:03] <Aeomin> I have no clue how in world Monotorrent related to minecraft..
[9:03] <TkTech> Animator: I'm just trying to fill in the facts so its for the right reasons.
[9:04] <vurtual> How is it illegal, Animator?
[9:04] * BeastBot (no@h73.241.29.71.dynamic.ip.windstream.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:04] <TkTech> Aeomin: The networking portion
[9:04] <Aeomin> ah..
[9:04] <Animator> Apparently TkTech said it uses Monotorrent.
[9:04] <TkTech> Queue/Cache.cs, Check.cs, Enums.cs, ICacheable.cd, MainLoop.cs, TorrentException.cs
[9:04] <vurtual> which is
[9:04] <Aeomin> tsk tsk tsk
[9:05] <vurtual> How does this make it illegal
[9:05] <Animator> EmpiresBane, it is, but I'm temporarily discussing it now for the sake of resolve legal problems and deciding the fate of Neko_Baron.
[9:05] <Aeomin> use the code w/o giving acknowledge?
[9:05] <TkTech> vurtual: You know how plagiarism gets you expelled from school? This is the same thing.
[9:06] <EmpiresBane> but on the forums?
[9:06] <TkTech> EmpiresBane: its not banned on the forums
[9:06] <Animator> It's not banned on the forums, no.
[9:06] * BeastBot is now known as Scott
[9:06] <EmpiresBane> then why was him linking to mcsharp bad?
[9:06] * Husky (adustus@c-98-214-120-75.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[9:07] <Animator> Because it was ridiculously questiobably legal.
[9:07] <EmpiresBane> ok
[9:07] <vurtual> Hmm
[9:07] <EmpiresBane> the universe makes sense again
[9:07] <Animator> At first, I thought it was because it isn't meant to be released, to which I'm wrong and it's actually open source. But now TkTech has told me it's illegal for a completely other reason.
[9:07] * Scott (no@h73.241.29.71.dynamic.ip.windstream.net) has left #minecraft
[9:08] <Animator> I'm just going to copy-paste this entire conversation for the sake of convienance.
[9:08] <vede> I made a brick texture. Now I'm going to link a screenshot of it to you guys, because I am a poor child in need of his peers' approval: http://i.imgur.com/PlFBd.jpg
[9:08] <TkTech> It was in the _transition_ of going open source, they weren't ready to release it yet but it had been re-licesnced internally
[9:08] <Aeomin> LOL
[9:09] <Animator> So it's a completely legal leak, but it's not legal because of other things.
[9:09] <TkTech> Animator: Indeed, as it was later revealed by framer, the source had to go open or replace the components that had been used without permission
[9:09] <TkTech> Animator: It also uses SmartIRC4Net without attribution
[9:09] <Animator> Well, that settles that.
[9:09] <Aeomin> Sounds like it used a lot third-party code w/o attribution...
[9:10] <TkTech> Yes, but again, they're young.
[9:10] <TkTech> No point raging on them
[9:10] <EmpiresBane> vede, what game is that?
[9:10] <TkTech> Educating is the better option

[9:16] <Animator> But now that I have your testimonial, I can break this case.

[9:21] <TkTech> But its had severe downtime since moving
[9:22] <Aeomin> that explains
[9:22] <TkTech> I have a person grudge against clone1018 so I can't help but poke fun at him, especially when its true ;)
[9:23] <Animator> Ditto.
[9:23] <Aeomin> wow.. a lot projects hosted on your site TkTech
[9:23] <TkTech> Yes, almost all minecraft projects are members of the coalition ^_^
[9:23] <Animator> dONE.

[9:27] <Animator> Oh wow. They added a man in their dev team named descension.
[9:27] <Animator> That's totally not a sign that someone's being replaced.
[9:27] <Aeomin> use NBT then
[9:28] <Inside> yeah, but is creative gonna use NBT?
[9:28] <LuciferZ> I hope so.
[9:28] <Aeomin> guess so
[9:28] <Inside> what's the time frame for that, anyone know?
[9:28] <Aeomin> when beta comes
[9:28] <Inside> is there a time frame.. for that? :p
[9:29] <Inside> or is it on valve time

[9:59] <vurtual> a lone guard wandered into this superagent chick in a bikini, then boom.
[9:59] <vurtual> guard defected
[10:00] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, why hate your life when others can do it for you?
[10:00] <Kodaichi> was gonna say that vurt, but i decided not to because it didn't MAKE SENSE.
[10:00] <vurtual> THEN SHE STOLE THE MONEY CASE
[10:00] <Kodaichi> oh no
[10:00] <darkedone02> I was invited by a friend's friend to go to a birthday party that my other friend said he is having, My friend was schedule to pick me up and he must of forgotten to pick me up before the party starts, or i was not informed that the party was cancelled
[10:01] <vurtual> turns out their birthday is later whoops
[10:01] <Azathoth> OH SHIT
[10:01] <Azathoth> i totally forgot
[10:01] <Azathoth> i'm so sorry darkedone02
[10:01] <Kodaichi> lol drama
[10:02] <vurtual> she instakilled someone :(
[10:02] <darkedone02> AndrewPH, i sometimes love life and I sometimes hate life. I love life because I am entertained, and I hate life due to suffering from any illness, people spreading bullshit, the ignorant starts chaos and other stupid that pisses me off.
[10:02] <Yourself> you're not missing out
[10:02] <vurtual> SOEMONE SAP HER SMARTS ALREADY
[10:02] <Yourself> last party i went to there wasn't any cake
[10:02] <Yourself> and they said there'd be cake
[10:02] <Azathoth> lol
[10:02] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, cool story, just ignore the bad things and live for the good
[10:02] <darkedone02> Azathoth.... that's such a bad joke
[10:03] <vurtual> looking to escape eh
[10:03] <AndrewPH> you're going to die, so just live life to its fullest
[10:03] <Azathoth> OMG WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE
[10:03] <Kodaichi> I spend every day trying to enjoy my life, mostly succeeding
[10:03] <vurtual> she's down to 5 smarts
[10:03] <vurtual> one more attack and boom.
[10:03] <Kodaichi> I'm probably the chillest guy i know
[10:03] <Azathoth> no me
[10:04] <darkedone02> haha... ignoring the bad things going to be very hard... losing is bad and pissing me off...
[10:04] <Kodaichi> haha well if you say so
[10:04] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, it's not hard you just fucking suck at it.
[10:04] <vurtual> they have INSTANT KILL attacks and ANTI-LOYALTY ATTACKS
[10:04] <darkedone02> ignorant people such as trolls and bad drivers, and shit... that pisses me off...
[10:04] <vurtual> like seriously
[10:04] <vurtual> Not only can they instnatly kill most anyone
[10:04] <vurtual> but they can turn my guys into enemies
[10:05] <Kodaichi> no. If you can't win, it means either the challenge is too hard, or you're at a disadvantage somehow
[10:05] <AndrewPH> I laugh at trolls
[10:05] <darkedone02> AndrewPH, Mostly I play team fortress 2, and I want to win almost everytime I play that game, if my team don't win, I get pissed off and yell at the dumbasses of my team.
[10:05] <Kodaichi> or you didn't try hard enough
[10:05] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, it's just a game holy shit
[10:05] <darkedone02> I won't be "Just me" it be that entire team that just sucks
[10:05] <AndrewPH> get anger management classes or play tf2 in competition mode
[10:05] <Azathoth> and people like darkedone02 are the reason i don't play online games
[10:05] <AndrewPH> ^
[10:05] <Kodaichi> lol
[10:05] <Yourself> i play tf2 :3
[10:05] <Kodaichi> in TF2, I play surf maps
[10:06] <Yourself> lol, surf
[10:06] <AndrewPH> I play tf2 for fun
[10:06] <vurtual> darkedone02, chillpills
[10:06] <vurtual> 5000000000000kg
[10:06] <Kodaichi> every map is a stalemate, always
[10:06] <AndrewPH> not to fucking scream at everybody
[10:06] <AndrewPH> and when people are screaming at other people
[10:06] <AndrewPH> I say "fuck off it's a game"
[10:06] <darkedone02> but hey, other then Team Fortress 2, I try to stay away from many games that pisses me off sometimes... like Civilization 4 or any games that I can cheat into and has mod support...
[10:06] <vurtual> anyways this chick is basically mentally stunned, to the point where she has no coherent thought
[10:06] <Kodaichi> when people scream at other people
[10:06] <Kodaichi> I record it
[10:06] <vurtual> killing her now seems like a good idea, or something, hmmm.
[10:06] <Azathoth> rape her
[10:07] <vurtual> THERE IS NO OPTION TO
[10:07] <vurtual> I VERY MUCH WANT TO BUT CANNOT
[10:07] <Kodaichi> heh
[10:07] <Topple> um, vurtual
[10:07] <Topple> What are you doing?
[10:08] <Sparky20> TF2 anyone?
[10:08] <Yourself> this guy on the TV doesn't want to talk to his doctor about his erectile dysfunction
[10:08] <vurtual> playing Evil Genius, that's what, Topple
[10:09] <Topple> fun game.
[10:09] <vurtual> here's how you deal with this
[10:09] <vurtual> 1. over the counter pills
[10:09] <vurtual> 2. Tell him "I need bonerpills."
[10:09] <darkedone02> so what if TF2 is a game, I want to win at this game... if I don't, I get pissed off, walls will be bloody, and sometimes wish I have a gun, shoot my computer and watch the bullet teleported to that person that I am pissed off at, and watch his head exploded... solve my problems...
[10:09] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, oh shut the fuck up
[10:09] <vurtual> darkedone02, you need some ragecure
[10:09] <AndrewPH> "I LOST IN SOMETHING FAKE I'M GOING TO SCREAM!"
[10:09] <vurtual> I suggest, firstly, a dog.
[10:09] <vurtual> Secondly, getting better.
[10:09] <darkedone02> or be an abusive admin and start banning people whoever fucking shot at me
[10:09] <vurtual> Thirdly, cry some more, bwahahahahaha.
[10:09] <Yourself> killing people usually creates more problems than it solves
[10:10] <vurtual> I LIIIVE, and I'M COMING FOR YOUUUUUUUUU
[10:10] <Yourself> or so i hear
[10:10] <vurtual> no really, I'll find you on any game you play, join the opposite team, and use my amazing skills to ensure you lose.
[10:11] <Sparky20> just go spy

[10:11] <vurtual> if it's an average TF2 24/7 2fort, then I'll have no problem doing a few caps.
[10:11] <darkedone02> and sometimes, if my team lost, I immediatly go to the other team by switching to spec mode, then to the opposite team once the door is open
[10:11] <Yourself> well, that partly explains why no one likes you
[10:11] <darkedone02> then watch my old team get steamed rolled by those hideous people.
[10:11] <Sparky20> same
[10:11] <darkedone02> actually Yourself, nobody say shit to me online when I switch team
[10:12] <Sparky20> more weapons = more variety = more fun
[10:12] <Yourself> doesn't mean they're not thinking it
[10:12] <Yourself> i hate people that do that
[10:12] <darkedone02> so I just switch team, watch my old get killed a couple of times, laugh my ass off, and had a good time... as long as I am winning.
[10:13] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, holy shit you're a dumbass
[10:13] <darkedone02> fu ck you

[10:19] <darkedone02> In Team Fortress 2, you suppose to beat the other team using teamwork and strategy... and a bit of action
[10:20] <Topple> I play games to have fun, but then again I suck at FPS and I would rather be coding.
[10:20] <AndrewPH> oh shut the fuck up
[10:20] <AndrewPH> not you topple
[10:20] <vurtual> no no in tf2
[10:20] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, learn to game
[10:20] <vurtual> you're supposed to preform whatever your class does
[10:20] <vurtual> and generally work towards a common goal
[10:20] <vurtual> with a handful of coordination
[10:20] <darkedone02> I do game, but your trolling... which is the reason why I am ignoring you
[10:20] <vurtual> not extreme tactic
[10:20] <vurtual> his trolling?
[10:20] <vurtual> What about his trolling, darkedone02?
[10:20] <AndrewPH> MY TROLLING
[10:20] <vurtual> It's actually flamming.
[10:20] <AndrewPH> It's actually trutthing
[10:20] <vurtual> yep
[10:21] <vurtual> Also, you'll have to ignore *!*@* to actually stop AndrewPH.
[10:21] <darkedone02> trolling, flaming, whatever... he is doing it, I am ignoring them.
[10:21] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, I have access to this channel through around 15 sources
[10:21] <AndrewPH> I just don't really feel like joining as myself with any of them
[10:21] <darkedone02> who gives a fuck?
[10:21] <vurtual> And then completely cut yourself off from the civilized world, and hide yourself unnoticedly, and then pray that I don't show up.
[10:21] <AndrewPH> darkedone02, so you AREN'T ignoring me?
[10:21] <Yourself> all i hear is that you have to rely on the rest of your team to make up for you sucking
[10:21] <AndrewPH> way2go
[10:21] <AndrewPH> lyar
[10:22] <Topple> Andrew is bashing Dark, true, but Dark doesn't know how to game in the first place.
[10:22] <darkedone02> nope, I tag along, slicing off heads, sniping heads off, burning people, healing people, gathering rage for buff banner, or teleporting people across the map.
[10:23] <darkedone02> trying to win the game, one way or the other.
[10:23] <Topple> But what if you just can't win.
[10:23] <AndrewPH> I somehow think he just sucks dick at playing tf2
[10:23] <darkedone02> I got about 42 kills as my top kill, and I play as engineer mostly.
[10:23] <Yourself> <AndrewPH> I somehow think he just sucks dick at playing tf2
[10:23] <AndrewPH> Haha
[10:23] <Yourself> probably because it sounds like he uses the eyelander
[10:23] <vurtual> eyelander doesn't suck :(
[10:23] <vurtual> he does, only 42 kills?
[10:23] <AndrewPH> I have 80 something as my top kills
[10:24] <AndrewPH> as a demo I think
[10:24] <darkedone02> I got about 19 heads from my eyelander... which is my personal record on the [noheroes] 2fort server
[10:24] <vurtual> oh no
[10:24] <vurtual> he visits there
[10:24] <vurtual> oh no oh no
[10:24] <AndrewPH> hold on guise
[10:24] <Yourself> lol, 2fort
[10:24] <AndrewPH> let me do something relaly awesome
[10:24] <vurtual> woah, since when i s my most played class demoman
[10:24] <vurtual> and spy?
[10:25] <darkedone02> not just 2fort, but I play along payload maps
[10:25] <vurtual> something is... off here.
[10:25] <vurtual> My "most points" is 29 for no discernable reason
[10:25] <vurtual> I've had >100 many times
[10:25] <Yourself> i haven't played tf2 since the stats reset
[10:25] <Yourself> i really should
[10:25] <vurtual> ...most kills 13 as scout?
[10:26] <vurtual> why is this so broken ;_;
[10:26] <darkedone02> i love payload maps... but I sometimes wish there was just a full warfare maps out there that deal with bots and players, max the playerlimit to 128, which is 64 vs 64, huge map and has a bit of RTS stuff... then it be awesome.
[10:26] <vurtual> darkedone02:
[10:26] <vurtual> pssssssssssssssst
[10:26] <vurtual> battlefield
[10:26] <vurtual> completely different game than tf2, and what you're looking for
[10:26] <Yourself> i hope you're not one of those VIP !swapteam abusers
[10:26] <vurtual> not 1942 though, only coo lepople can play that
[10:26] <darkedone02> I'm talking TF2, although I doubt it will happen.
[10:26] <vurtual> and you BEST not be tryin' to play desert combat
[10:26] <vurtual> or we'll rape you up the butts.
[10:27] <darkedone02> I used to play battlefield 2142 and battlefield 2, over many mods... have not join back after I converted from windows xp to vista.
[10:27] <vurtual> TF2 is not even remotely the game you're asking for
[10:27] <gm|lap> in BF2 (battlefield 2) you actually have to learn how to fly the helicopters and the planes before you even try to try to use them in multiplayer
[10:28] <gm|lap> also a joystick helps
[10:28] <vurtual> it'd be like saying "well I want tetris but instead of blocks falling in, they move in from the screen sides, and there's gems, and it's alawys full and the goal is to make gem combos"
[10:28] <vurtual> that's bejewled
[10:28] <Yourself> gm|lap: joystick doesn't help in BC2
[10:28] <vurtual> not tetris
[10:28] <Yourself> since the rudder is fucking reverse
[10:28] <Yourself> reversed*
[10:28] <darkedone02> I used to play on that project reality, It was quite fun, full of content and all, but sometimes i was boring with those maps that you can be a civilian...
[10:28] <gm|lap> Yourself: i think you can tweak the controls
[10:28] <vurtual> reverse your rudder axis?
[10:28] <]Shadaez[> lol
[10:29] <Yourself> you can invert the vertical axis only
[10:29] <Yourself> so no matter what you do something ends up backwards
[10:29] <vurtual> your controls.
[10:29] <vurtual> as in, your joystick
[10:29] <vurtual> As in, use joystick software and reverse the controls.
[10:29] <darkedone02> I kinda like and dislike BF: BC 2 when I beta tested it... shotguns are weak, and sometimes the sniper weapons.
[10:29] <Yourself> i hate the flight dynamics in BC2 anyway
[10:30] <Yourself> they've done a lot of tweaks to the guns
[10:30] <Yourself> the m60 was overpowered for so long
[10:30] <Yourself> they've also nerfed grenades pretty bad
[10:30] <Marafk> haha, did Pixel REALLY describe it like that?? http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaveStory
[10:31] <darkedone02> I like BF: BC because of the loads of unlockabled weapons you can unlock.
[10:31] <Marafk> redundancy for the ftw
[10:31] <darkedone02> almost similar to Modern Warfare 2... I love to try to unlock every attachment on all my weapons, FMJ are the hardest to unlock.
[10:32] <darkedone02> because I have to gain 40 Kills via from walls... it takes me a while to complete it...
[10:33] <darkedone02> the only level I could get more kills on that type is over at this raining level.
[10:34] <darkedone02> i have not play MW2 in quite some time... I was busy playing other games then playing that... I stop playing after there was so many hackers and shit in the game, it's not funny.

[12:21] <vurtual> and how your mind can fabricate things based off of memories?
[12:21] <vurtual> What about all those times your mind tiredly cobbled together games that do not exist?
[12:22] <TrueWolves> It happens
[12:22] <vurtual> "Wha-I don't remember that in that one game, that seems really fun-hmmm... no wait... that's two places mixed together."
[12:22] <TrueWolves> From someone who's studied memory for a while, it really does happen
[12:22] <TrueWolves> If your memory ever forms gaps (and it /will/ sooner or later) your mind is much more likely to subconsiusly add parts to fix the gaps then notice them
[12:23] <Yourself> yep
[12:23] <Yourself> isn't it the left brain that likes doing that?
[12:23] <vurtual> Just happened: 007's Frigate garage thingy near the chopper, maybe a bit of the Depot, and then one map from The Specialists that was a part of a city, and had some kind of loadingy-area in it

[12:23] <vurtual> also, memroies of Medal of Honor in the shipyards of a loading area that was actually part of goldeneye's depot
[12:23] <Yourself> where the right brain does something and the left brain comes up with an explanation for it
[12:23] <vurtual> medal of honor: frontline seems a bit like a goldeneye in ww2 sometimes
[12:23] <Yourself> even though it doesn't actually know the reasons behind the action
[12:24] <Yourself> i can't remember
[12:24] <TrueWolves> Eh, that's a diffrent thing
[12:24] <TrueWolves> but... yeah, the two are related accualy...
[12:24] <vurtual> anyways I'm still on Yourself's server
[12:24] <vurtual> and still excessively constructing
[12:24] <gear> i downloaded
[12:24] <TrueWolves> That happens in split-brained people becuase of the whole "lets fill in the gaps thing"
[12:24] <gear> 50 megabytes
[12:24] <gear> of keygen music
[12:24] <gear> fuck yea nerd!
[12:24] <vurtual> keygen music?
[12:24] <TrueWolves> Your brain fills in the gaps of your other brains actions, it also does this for memory however.
[12:24] <Yourself> i always figured the filling in of gaps is what makes some people think they saw the future in a dream
[12:25] <vurtual> still have plenty of evil genius stuff, and goldeneye soundtrack, to replenish my creativity.
[12:25] <vurtual> Yourself plays a targeted jab at me.
[12:25] <Yourself> when the memory of the dream was just vague and full of holes
[12:25] <gear> you know how old school keygens always had a funky chiptunes song
[12:25] <Yourself> and their brain took parts of an experience that happened later and patched in those holes
[12:25] <vurtual> veeeery targeted
[12:26] <vurtual> and no I pretty sure I've distincly mentioned at least... one or two to people, then later saw them.
[12:26] <vurtual> "Dude, I had this weird dream about... the president having a train, and... I was sitting there and watching it on TV."
[12:26] <vurtual> or it could be like some horrible sinister mix of vague memory and coincidences.
[12:27] <vurtual> and I'm actually a mentally challenged person who is slipping deep into insanity
[12:27] <TrueWolves> most likely that later
[12:27] <vurtual> and will probably die as his mind fails to even coherently have a personality, or comprehend eating
[12:27] <TrueWolves> IE vague memory and coincidences
[12:28] <vurtual> or SOMETHING STRANGE AND COOL which could THEORETICALLY BE EXPLAINED WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO "A WIZARD DID IT" happens.
[12:28] <vurtual> I'll pick that one, because it makes me feel like I'm not a machine who can only socialize for a primal goal.
[12:28] <vurtual> now why does closing firefox BLANK MY CLIPBOARD

[13:20] <TrueWolves> I noticed that
[13:20] <TrueWolves> it bothered me
[13:20] <TrueWolves> and then of course you know what happens next
[13:20] <Marach> i didn't
[13:21] <Marach> butbut the credits :(
[13:21] <Marach> they're shown alive
[13:21] <TrueWolves> that was a flash back
[13:21] <Drakkar> THEY WERE EATEN
[13:21] <TrueWolves> Which raises questions on how Booster made 2 robots that clearly had souls.

[13:23] <Marach> ...i didn't kill her as fast as i could?
[13:23] <Marach> i wish that was possible >:(
[13:23] <Speljohan_> so.. my smb3d release will be delayed slightly
[13:23] <Speljohan_> cos i had epic ideas piling up now
[13:23] <Speljohan_> they deviate from smb but still must implement
[13:24] <Speljohan_> i shall add light sources!!
[13:24] <Speljohan_> :D
[13:24] <Marach> win
[13:24] <Speljohan_> and yes
[13:24] <Speljohan_> editor will allow u to place them
[13:25] <Speljohan_> and tweak settings for them
[13:25] <Marach> :3
[13:25] <Speljohan_> i shall add a few different light sources of course
[13:25] <Marach> you can bundle some third-party levels
[13:25] <Speljohan_> like, arc light (eg a lamp)
[13:25] <Marach> ahem.
[13:25] <Speljohan_> flashlight etc
[13:25] <Speljohan_> i am also considering rope physics
[13:26] <Speljohan_> for hanging lightsource

[13:27] <Speljohan_> need to add 2 different modes
[13:27] <]bildramer> Speljohan_, what happen
[13:27] <Speljohan_> "painting mode" which is placing shhit
[13:27] <]bildramer> 3D SMB delayed?
[13:27] <Speljohan_> and "property mode"
[13:27] <]bildramer> D:

[13:29] <Speljohan_> will be shitloads of work
[13:29] <Speljohan_> but i rly want to do it
[13:29] <Speljohan_> because then i can add an extension system
[13:29] <Shadaez> is a script system really that hard?
[13:29] <Speljohan_> add extension to object
[13:29] <bildramer> I'm considering telling you to play some AoE1
[13:29] <Speljohan_> like, lightsource object

[13:29] * Slash-Caps (Slash-caps@94-195-154-156.zone9.bethere.co.uk) has joined #minecraft
[13:30] <bildramer> well, add it
[13:30] <Speljohan_> Shadaez it is when you need to write a high-level lib to handle lua for java
[13:30] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:30] <Speljohan_> i've only made a half-finished one
[13:32] <bildramer> http://i.imgur.com/zZrOf.jpg lol
[13:32] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:34] <Speljohan_> anyways, if i add an extension system i'll get more work on my hands
[13:34] <Speljohan_> because then i have to alter the map file format to incorporate the "extensions" somehow
[13:34] <Speljohan_> either that or have them downloaded from a server
[13:34] <Shadaez> wouldn't it be way easier if you wront it in the same language?
[13:34] <Speljohan_> whereas the latter is not really something i can do at the moment
[13:35] <Speljohan_> the problem isn't really adding a script engine Shadaez
[13:35] <Speljohan_> the problem is how i shall incorporate a level + its extensions in a decent way
[13:36] <Shadaez> i was just wondering because it makes sense to me
[13:36] <Shadaez> i've never done anything like that
[13:36] <Speljohan_Laptop> anywayz, my half-finished lua library http://pastebin.com/MxJTvnWw

[17:16] <Marach> but orange box would be more expensive in steam even with $'s
[17:17] <CrazySpai> If you're going to give Steam a bad name for 1 game being more expensive than retail. You're being unreasonable.
[17:18] <CrazySpai> Orange Box is $30 on steam. What is the retail price?
[17:18] <Marach> 50z??. ca. $17
[17:18] <Quatroking> 20 euros
[17:18] <Quatroking> on steam, 30 euros
[17:18] <CrazySpai> It's $30 in Amazon. It's $30 on Steam.
[17:18] <Quatroking> this is why I only buy during christmas and shit
[17:19] <Marach> i buy in damn shops. or gog. steam only when it's unavailable anywhere else
[17:19] <CrazySpai> Best Buy has VAT added, so it's always more than the retail price.
[17:20] <CrazySpai> That's the only place to grab PC games anymore.
[17:20] <Marach> 30 eur = 115z??

[22:49] <bildramer> uh
[22:50] <bildramer> actually
[22:50] <Yourself> metaballs are defined by a potential function
[22:50] <bildramer> it's the inverse radius^sumshit that determines color
[22:50] <Yourself> and their boundary is taken where that functions has a constant value

[22:50] <bildramer> well, yep

[22:50] <AzureAngelioc> i have no idea what the hell any of that means

[23:34] <slowriot> those are both fine
[23:34] <Chezhead> Yeah, I'm almost dreading the completion of this game
[23:34] <bildramer> lol
[23:34] <slowriot> i just want a TINY bit more of a point to the game, so i could play it as it is
[23:34] <bildramer> I want MP asap
[23:34] <slowriot> and feel like i'm working for something
[23:34] <bildramer> then everything is just unimportant updates
[23:34] <slowriot> right now it's already cool enoguh to just play for days and days
[23:34] <EmpiresBane> i wouldn't mind buggy as hell multiplayer even if it was like the free survival
[23:34] <bildramer> but all features of indev before infdev should be in
[23:35] <slowriot> but then i end up with NOTHING, as i haven't really achieved anything except moving blocks around
[23:35] <slowriot> with mp, there would be a point
[23:35] <slowriot> with quests or some shit like that, there would be a point
[23:35] <EmpiresBane> adding multip;ayer will add so much to the game
[23:35] <bildramer> yes
[23:35] <EmpiresBane> even without quets
[23:35] <slowriot> i still can't envisage how it'll turn out - it could go so right or so wrong
[23:35] <slowriot> well no, it can't go wrong really
[23:36] <Chezhead> Yeah, I put up a topic in "Discussion" about the podcast I was thinking about
[23:36] <slowriot> but it could be an amazing createfest, or a gruelling survival challenge, or just a violent pvp battle
[23:36] <Chezhead> It will fail, but you never know
[23:36] <slowriot> depending on how things balance
[23:36] <slowriot> or it could end up as lonely as it is currently, with every player digging their own tunnels individually like so many tiny worms in a garden patch
[23:36] <Chezhead> I see the first betas of MP survival being buggy weird things...
[23:36] <slowriot> occasionally crossing another miner's tunnel, the mole in the hole nowhere to be found
[23:36] <EmpiresBane> as long as there is FF, there will never be an end of things to do
[23:36] <slowriot> melancholy wanderings through underground catacombs
[23:36] <slowriot> AAH A SPIDER!
[23:36] <slowriot> etc
[23:37] <slowriot> or, someone comes along behind you as you dig and nicks all your torches

[23:37] <LuciferZ> That's odd, I've never had Java crash like that.
[23:37] <blaster> Realy?

[23:38] <LuciferZ> But that time it just locked.
[23:38] <blaster> Are you using up too much of your ram doing other things?
[23:38] <Chezhead> It always locks up when errors arrise
[23:39] <EmpiresBane> Chezhead, but it also whitens things
[23:41] <Chezhead> Lightens the entire browser window? Or Just the java applet window?
[23:41] <blaster> Crash again?
[23:41] <AzureAngelioc> multiplayer makes anything better
[23:41] <Chezhead> For me, it just crashes like a normal "not responding" and I have to shut off the chrome and java processes in the Task Manager
[23:41] <LuciferZ> Yeah
[23:41] <LuciferZ> Well
[23:41] <LuciferZ> That was just a connection loss

[23:42] <blaster> It was only you
[23:42] <AzureAngelioc> you know what would be awesome
[23:42] <AzureAngelioc> multiplayer dwarf fortress
[23:42] <Chezhead> THAT WOULD

[23:42] <AzureAngelioc> everybody gets an individual group of dwarves in one map
[23:42] <bildramer> over console this has been made
[23:42] <bildramer> lol telnet
[23:42] <blaster> Multiplayer dwarf fortress would be impossible
[23:43] <bildramer> many people look
[23:43] <blaster> Because it would be imbalanced
[23:43] <Chezhead> *chezhead [crossbones] carp*
[23:43] <bildramer> and anyone can control
[23:43] <Chezhead> *luciferZ [crossbones] carp*

[23:43] <Chezhead> *blaster [crossbones] carp*
[23:43] <AzureAngelioc> and their own dwarves
[23:43] <AzureAngelioc> either work together or fight over resources
[23:43] <AzureAngelioc> also a fifth player gets to control the carp
[23:43] <AzureAngelioc> and try to kill everybody else
[23:44] <Yourself> <bildramer> blaster stfu
[23:44] <AzureAngelioc> just imagine
[23:44] <Yourself> that's what i come back to
[23:44] <AzureAngelioc> you actually have to fuck up other people's stupid dwarves with wildlife and disasters
[23:44] <AzureAngelioc> it would be glorious
[23:45] <AzureAngelioc> every year you pick a dwarf to enter a mood
[23:45] <AzureAngelioc> and you get to decide when to send thieves or goblins
[23:45] <bildramer> um
[23:45] <EmpiresBane> send stray kitties to an unwitting plauer
[23:45] <EmpiresBane> *player
[23:45] <AzureAngelioc> obviously there'd be limits

[23:46] <bildramer> lol
[23:46] <AzureAngelioc> yes
[23:46] <bildramer> then make the grownup cats adopt the butcherer
[23:46] <bildramer> erer? erer.
[23:46] <AzureAngelioc> every kitty has a kitty meter
[23:46] <AzureAngelioc> when its full you get to make them adopt

[23:54] <AzureAngelioc> "holy book of death"
[23:55] <AzureAngelioc> seems a little oxymoronic
