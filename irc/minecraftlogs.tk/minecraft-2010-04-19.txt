[1:02] <Ickum> O.o
[1:02] <SubterfugeProfanity> don't be a dick
[1:02] <Azathoth> yeah, i don't know. it's some debugging information that you probably don't need to concern yourself with :\
[1:03] <SubterfugeProfanity> so the question remains: how many of the whiners here are boys who have been sucked into this game, and how many are girls who just play it because it's fun to be creative? That is the real question.
[1:03] <SubterfugeProfanity> The /real/ question.
[1:03] <Ickum> ah
[1:03] <Ickum> I've been broadcasting minecraft for a few months now, and idk how many people ran out and bought the game xD
[1:03] <Ickum> but there has been a lot...

[1:09] <Ickum> Depending on my ADD
[1:09] <Ickum> XD
[1:09] <Naxza> You crazy people. XD

[1:09] * Cial uses the scroll wheel
[1:09] <SubterfugeProfanity> It has number keys .. i'd just rather have a mouse, so therefore I'm getting a mouse.
[1:09] <LuciferZ> I forget why I stoped.
[1:09] <Kokopure> I would neeever use number wheel.
[1:09] <Subhazard|wallflower> I played this one FPS game where I would fire with the scroll wheel. Like, every 'notch' I rolled it, it would fire a shot.
[1:09] <LG_Legacy> Also Naxza
[1:09] <LuciferZ> stopped*
[1:10] <LG_Legacy> Glass
[1:10] <Kokopure> number keys

[1:10] <SubterfugeProfanity> Scroll wheel > anyhthing else.
[1:10] <Azathoth> sounds awful, subhazard :\
[1:10] <Kokopure> agreed.
[1:10] <LuciferZ> Oh my god number wheel

[1:10] <LuciferZ> I must invent this
[1:10] <nibbsy> Yes it is
[1:10] <Kokopure> nobody will buy it!
[1:10] * Kokopure is a naysayer
[1:10] <Naxza> I'd buy a number wheel.
[1:10] <Kokopure> aw you.
[1:10] <nibbsy> You can see glorious dirt
[1:11] <Naxza> Glorious dirt!
[1:11] <Naxza> Ah, glorious dirt.
[1:11] <Azathoth> i mean i've seen people bind jumping to the scroll wheel for easier bunny hopping... but shootign!?
[1:11] <CrazySpai> Unless you put gold behund the glass
[1:11] <Kokopure> or LAVA behind the glass.
[1:11] <CrazySpai> :D
[1:11] <Kokopure> then Glass is plenty useful.
[1:11] <CrazySpai> Too bad you can't build
[1:11] <CrazySpai> Under lava
[1:11] <Kokopure> you can't??
[1:11] <CrazySpai> It simply just pushes the lava up
[1:11] <SubterfugeProfanity> well, think of it like this ... if the number keys do the same thing as a scroll wheel.. that means the scroll wheel = number wheel.
[1:11] <rbos> I built a lava tunnel in infdev with the sand lava bug
[1:11] <SubterfugeProfanity> duh.
[1:11] <Kokopure> does it really?
[1:11] <rbos> and lots of glass
[1:11] <rbos> it's pretty
[1:11] <Classiest|indev> ugh
[1:11] <Kokopure> it pushes the lava up if you build underneath it?
[1:12] <CrazySpai> From what I've experienced
[1:12] <rbos> if you put a sand block on top of lava, the sand turns into lava
[1:12] <Azathoth> i'd use glass more if it weren't so ugly -_-

[1:17] <Kokopure> be glad he knows what hard drives are
[1:17] <nibbsy> It's a computer
[1:17] <Azathoth> i think people just assume that since hard drives "remember" stuff on a computer permanently, that they're memory
[1:17] <Kokopure> lord knows he isn't going to be tinkering around with the inside of it anytime soon.
[1:18] <Naxza> Huh. It takes about seven hunks of coal to smelt 64 blocks of iron.

[1:20] <nibbsy> Back
[1:20] <Azathoth> front
[1:20] <rbos> there's nothing in the von neumann computer architecture that says you have to separate temporary and permanent storage. I've toyed around with the idea of 'gradated' memory, where permanent and temporary storage share the same address space.
[1:20] <rbos> basically memory would just act ask a cache layer for permanent storage
[1:20] <rbos> -k
[1:20] <rbos> which is really what it is
[1:21] <Azathoth> erm
[1:21] <Azathoth> that just doesn't seem like a terribly good idea
[1:22] <rbos> I didn't say I've thought it through all that deeply

[1:35] <Kokopure> would they?

[1:35] <Classiest|indev> go intoy uor base
[1:35] <Classiest|indev> click a block

[1:35] <Kokopure> but...
[1:36] <Kokopure> what if the creepers spawned in the darkness.
[1:36] <Classiest|indev> it's be very simple to link lights to a certain switch
[1:36] <Kokopure> they don't burn in the light.
[1:36] <Classiest|indev> Then you turn on the inside lights
[1:36] <Classiest|indev> Well

[2:34] <sppt`> man you gotta love musicians... at a show during roadburn, the guitarist of a band had to take a dump so they stopped playing
[2:34] <sppt`> haha
[2:34] <Quatroking> gotta love artists
[2:34] <Quatroking> they get a writers block and don't give shit for weeks
[2:35] <AndrewPH> copyboy, If you're annoyed by ONE notice, just /ignore bananabot
[2:35] <Quatroking> and then BOOM shitload of stuff
[2:35] <copyboy> AndrewPH: no bots allowed. that's the rule
[2:35] <AndrewPH> copyboy, It's a logging bot you retard
[2:36] <copyboy> no
[2:36] <AndrewPH> yes
[2:36] <AndrewPH> it is
[2:36] <AndrewPH> that's all it is
[2:36] <copyboy> it's an annoy-copyboy-bot
[2:36] <AndrewPH> copyboy, so /ignore it
[2:36] <copyboy> it's sends notices around, so it's NOT a logging-bot
[2:36] <AndrewPH> On join

[2:37] <AndrewPH> It's in java and I really don't feel like downloading a jdk
[2:38] <copyboy> well you can modify the message, right?
[2:38] <AndrewPH> I can
[2:38] <copyboy> so why can't you turn it off?
[2:38] <AndrewPH> Because turning it off isn't in the config
[2:38] <AndrewPH> modifying it is

[2:39] <VisualBasicGUI> Is there a way to stop pigs/sheep from spawning inside your stuff? -_-
[2:39] <Kokopure> okay that makes sense
[2:39] <Kokopure> Visual, there is.
[2:39] <Espiodude2> No Visual xD
[2:39] <Espiodude2> Well
[2:39] <Kokopure> your stuff should be in total darkness.
[2:39] <Kokopure> of course then you have to worry about creepers and skeletons and zombies.
[2:39] <Espiodude2> You can use more unusual blocks
[2:39] <Kokopure> :P
[2:40] <Espiodude2> Like half blocks for walls and everything
[2:40] <VisualBasicGUI> errr
[2:40] <VisualBasicGUI> so its either creepers or pigs
[2:40] <VisualBasicGUI> almost tempted to go with the creepers
[2:40] <Espiodude2> Pigs = Better than SSSS-Waitwha-BOOM
[2:41] <Kokopure> haha pretty much
[2:41] <Konogan> Alright, starting morrowind livestream.
[2:41] <Konogan> http://www.livestream.com/konogan
[2:41] <Kokopure> I've thought that same thing, Visual
[2:41] <Kokopure> "at least creepers give me something that isn't more ham."
[2:41] <Konogan> if anybody's interested
[2:41] <VisualBasicGUI> lol
[2:41] <VisualBasicGUI> yea
[2:41] <rbos> I like ham.
[2:41] <Kokopure> I have an entire large chest full of ham.
[2:41] <rbos> stock up on it in prep for multiplayer
[2:41] <Kokopure> it is taking forever to cook.
[2:42] <VisualBasicGUI> same here
[2:42] <Kokopure> you know what I would like?
[2:42] <Kokopure> if even unstackable items stacked in chests.
[2:42] <Kokopure> that would just make my day.
[2:42] <Kokopure> I don't care if I can only carry a certain number of hams
[2:42] <Malikat> haaaam
[2:42] <Kokopure> but I want to be able to store more hams
[2:42] <Malikat> that would be amazing
[2:42] <Malikat> i want unstackables to stack in chests.
[2:42] <Kokopure> am I right or am I right?
[2:42] <rbos> I wouldn't mind the unstackability if Notch implemented an action bar that used items in my inventory, instead of actually being inventory slots
[2:43] <rbos> best of both worlds - you can't carry assloads of food, and you still don't have to constantly open your inventory
[2:43] <Kokopure> exactly!
[2:43] <VisualBasicGUI> i was thinking something similar rbos
[2:43] <Kokopure> see, rbos, that's why it's a good idea.
[2:43] <VisualBasicGUI> a queue
[2:43] <copyboy> AndrewPH: who needs a logging bot anyway?
[2:43] <AndrewPH> copyboy, oh god shut the fuck up
[2:43] <AndrewPH> I asked animator before bringing it on
[2:44] <copyboy> i know
[2:44] <Quatroking> andrewph I swear I'm going to rape you in the ass
[2:44] <Azathoth> or if you use up all of an item in one slot, it should be replaced by another in the inventory if possible

[3:05] <vurtual> minecraft should have grenade launcher enemies.
[3:06] <vurtual> If you kill one, they drop grenades, that can be thrown, or fired from a weapon for slightly less damage.

[3:08] <Espiodude2> lewl
[3:08] <vurtual> and only take damage at certain spots because being reasonable is not a grenade launcher enemy thing.

[3:37] <thechris> are you in infdev
[3:37] <Vicrry> I has a couple diamond
[3:37] <VisualBasicGUI> yes
[3:37] <rbos> I've heard that in infdev, when you find diamond seams they're huge
[3:37] <Naxza> Gotta dig deep, buddy.
[3:37] <Vicrry> You cannot has
[3:37] <thechris> go to the bottom
[3:37] <thechris> very bottom
[3:37] <VisualBasicGUI> can't go any deeper
[3:37] <thechris> like bottom layer
[3:37] <VisualBasicGUI> less i find a lava proof suit :p
[3:37] <Kokopure> hey, question.
[3:37] <thechris> then start minin
[3:37] <Vicrry> question?
[3:37] <thechris> yes kok?
[3:38] <Kokopure> Land Claim Flags are commonly touted as an antigriefing measure
[3:38] <thechris> ya
[3:38] <Kokopure> because they'd, like, presumably stop griefers from altering your structure or whatever
[3:38] <thechris> its called raiding
[3:38] <rbos> it's one possible part of the eventual puzzle, imo
[3:38] <Kokopure> right?
[3:38] <thechris> thats what ppl think
[3:38] <Kokopure> what if Griefers just start throwing land claim flags all over the wilderness
[3:38] <rbos> I think land claim flags would help but not be a solution
[3:38] <Kokopure> and keep people from building there?
[3:38] <DimJim> i think there are going to be multiple servers
[3:38] <Vicrry> And can I has someone check my livestream again?
[3:38] * mail2345|offline is now known as mail2345
[3:38] <rbos> I imagine a) land claim flags would be somewhat hard to make, and b) they'd expire after a while
[3:39] <thechris> thats why i think land claim flags suck
[3:39] <DimJim> some will be more cooperation-oriented, and others would be pvp-type
[3:39] <DimJim> kind of like wurm in a way
[3:39] <Vicrry> I'm interested in seeing if it's doing my tunes too
[3:39] <thechris> i would just have one of my freinds with no lives protect mine
[3:39] <rbos> if i were going to implement land claims, there'd be several levels of them, upgradeable with better materials
[3:39] <thechris> i got freinds in diffrent time zones, so that should help
[3:39] <rbos> like, a basic flag would be enough for a small house, 9x9 say
[3:39] <vurtual> minecraft is a world where you can dig and damage anything
[3:39] <vurtual> no matter what
[3:40] <vurtual> survival requires tools
[3:40] <vurtual> but a magical flag won't keep you away
[3:40] <thechris> i would play on a privite sever, like atimmers has no greifing, never had any EVER
[3:40] <rbos> we're not talking about whether or not they're worth having, vurtual, we're talking about how they'd work if you did have them
[3:40] <thechris> I GOT A SULTION
[3:40] <thechris> hide your stuff
[3:41] <thechris> duh
[3:41] <vurtual> maybe we should talk the mechanics of a rape system
[3:41] <VisualBasicGUI> anyone know if light from lava counts for stopping creepers, etc from spawning like torches?
[3:41] <thechris> SPIDERS
[3:41] <vurtual> not wether we should have one, just IF we had one, what it'd be like!
[3:41] <rbos> VisualBasicGUI: it does
[3:41] <VisualBasicGUI> thanks rbos
[3:41] <thechris> any light will stop mobs from spawning
[3:41] <Vicrry> You kknow, as soon as I hear that a server has had no griefing, it makes me want to go build a big sign that says "NOT ANYMORE N00BZ!"
[3:41] <Naxza> I'm thinking land claims should just identify the owners of a chunk of land and maybe keep mobs from spawning on it.
[3:41] <rbos> lots of people use lava to light up tunnels to save on torches :)
[3:41] <thechris> but lava doesnt work well
[3:41] <Naxza> 'Cuz there's nothing like having a creeper spawn six tiles away and blow up in your face.
[3:41] <thechris> case it evaporates
[3:41] <thechris> :O
[3:42] <rbos> griefing is like spamming, you're not going to be able to get rid of it, just minimize it. There's going to be tradeoffs between open gameplay and letting any asshole spam dicks across the landscape.
[3:42] <DimJim> bottom-level lava doesn't
[3:42] <Kokopure> haha
[3:42] <VisualBasicGUI> its what i was doing, but then a zombie jumped me from behind
[3:42] <vurtual> rbos there's the real tradeoff though
[3:42] <VisualBasicGUI> so i started to wonder
[3:42] <Yourself> lol dicks
[3:42] <vurtual> there's like 2-3 of them at a time
[3:42] <VisualBasicGUI> must have missed a spot
[3:42] <vurtual> at most
[3:42] <Kokopure> I just found a pretty interesting post on the forums
[3:42] <vurtual> and you can hit one button and they go away
[3:42] <Naxza> Whyyyyy.
[3:42] <Naxza> All my stuff just got asploded by a mob of creepers.
[3:42] <rbos> exactly, you have to hit a button to make them go away
[3:42] <rbos> that is a problem
[3:42] <Kokopure> "Just running up and punching somebody, armor or not, will annoy them and potentially kill them if they are on a cliff/fighting."
[3:42] <rbos> better to prevent them
[3:42] <Kokopure> I just thought of me playing Multiplayer, fighting some zombies
[3:43] <Kokopure> and some random dude just comes along and smacks me around with his bare hands
[3:43] <rbos> also, I like sleep from time to time
[3:43] <DimJim> i want to make a large serrated disc trap
[3:43] <thechris> rbos, just find some people in diffrent time zones, and build with them,
[3:44] <rbos> thechris: Too much organization required; it just won't happen.
[3:44] <thechris> rbos, ORR just play on a privite sever with freinds
[3:44] <rbos> That's a possibility too!
[3:45] <rbos> but I don't want to see everyone locked out of my MPS game just because some tiny minority of players are assholes.
[3:45] <Naxza> I think people are far too worried about griefers or care waaay too much about their digital stuff.
[3:45] <vurtual> freeeeiiinnds
[3:46] <Yourself> with infinite worlds hiding your shit should be pretty trivial

[3:46] <rbos> I want something with decently deep gameplay, that's all.
[3:46] <rbos> hiding all my stuff and playing 2-hour multiplayer games isn't all that compelling.
[3:46] <Espiodude2|Sexy> Some people like gardens and outside houses =/
[3:46] <Naxza> Deep isn't a feature you're likely to find online.
[3:47] <VisualBasicGUI> holy crap
[3:47] <Yourself> well, i assume that servers will be capable of having player specific spawn points
[3:47] <VisualBasicGUI> i never realized how far i tunneled
[3:47] <vurtual> ok guys here's my idea for fast travel guys
[3:47] <Yourself> by hiding i mean just wandering off in some direction from the default spawn
[3:47] <vurtual> it's shockingly simple
[3:47] <Yourself> get far enough away and you're almost guaranteed no one will ever find it
[3:47] <vurtual> like, easy to do and everything
[3:48] <rbos> There's not a lot of point playing in a multiplayer game where you never actually engage with other players. If I wanted to play a game by myself, I'd do that.
[3:48] <vurtual> tauntauns!
[3:48] <Admiral|Splatticus> I want to shoot people in the face.
[3:48] <rbos> me too!
[3:48] <vurtual> that can run quickly, then sprint for even more speed, and jump far, but don't turn sharp enough to just go anywhere.
[3:48] <Yourself> i'm not trying to tell you what to do, i'm trying to motivate those people who are scared to death of getting their shit griefed
[3:48] <vurtual> then they can run up one block levels, and over one block gaps.
[3:49] <Kokopure> Admiral|Splatticus
[3:49] <rbos> I want to invade a castle and go through prepared defences, evade traps, blow up walls.
[3:49] <Admiral|Splatticus> Kokopure.

[3:49] <rbos> heh, pro tip, don't fight on a cliff :D
[3:50] <Vicrry> So, any other takers on testing my livestream? I'd love to get this working so people can watch me be really boring in Indev :P www.livestream.com/vicrry
[3:50] <Admiral|Splatticus> I just had a further advancement on that idea. If you time a click right, with an empty hand, you can catch the frisbee.
[3:50] <Kokopure> Vicrry, I already said it worked
[3:50] <rbos> Is notch planning to implement something like a global cooldown on, eg, arrows?
[3:50] <Vicrry> I was hoping for tunes as well Koko
[3:50] <rbos> So that people with autoclickers don't riddle you with 300 arrows per second
[3:50] <Kokopure> global cooldown?
[3:50] <vurtual> no seriously
[3:50] <vurtual> a small tauntaun like animal
[3:50] <Admiral|Splatticus> Rbos, I hope not. I like fast-click fire.
[3:51] <Kokopure> I like fastclick, but rbos brings up a good point.
[3:51] <rbos> Kokopure: yeah, so there's, say, a 100ms delay between arrows.
[3:51] <Kokopure> well actually rbos
[3:51] <Kokopure> you can FIRE that many arows a second
[3:51] <Kokopure> buuuut
[3:51] <Admiral|Splatticus> Just make it so they can't assign fire to mousewheel.
[3:51] <Kokopure> you can't get HIT by that many.
[3:51] <Kokopure> don't you know?
[3:51] <rbos> I didn't, no
[3:51] <Kokopure> have you ever fired a lot of arrows at mobs?
[3:51] <Yourself> Admiral|Splatticus, that wouldn't stop anything
[3:51] <rbos> I haven't, I was just wondering.
[3:51] <Kokopure> they have a short invincibility timer after getting hit by an arrow
[3:51] <Yourself> just get an auto-clicker
[3:51] <Kokopure> the rest of the arrows bounce off
[3:51] <rbos> oh cool
[3:51] <Admiral|Splatticus> Rofl yourself, I was making a CS reference.
[3:52] <rbos> that's helpful
[3:52] <Kokopure> it's helpful for the mobs XD
[3:52] <vurtual> so you have the tauntaun creature and while riding, you can time your shots with a bow and hit people with arrows that are sped up by your fast riding
[3:52] <Yourself> ok
[3:52] <Kokopure> but yeah, try it in game
[3:52] <vurtual> so arrows go straighter, faster, and deal more damage.
[3:52] <Admiral|Splatticus> I love nomnomnom eating chef boyardee cold straight from the can nomnomnom.
[3:52] <rbos> Kokopure: I wonder if that's an artifact of latency between the client -> server -> client. So if you have a really bad connection, you end up immune for that duration.
[3:52] <vurtual> Admiral|Splatticus that's unsafe
[3:52] <Admiral|Splatticus> No it's not, vurt. :l
[3:53] <Admiral|Splatticus> They completely cook shit before they can it.
[3:53] <Admiral|Splatticus> And even if it is, oh well, I'll die. :D
[3:53] <Vicrry> Canning involves cooking it
[3:53] <vurtual> yeah but still

[5:29] <Malikat> a) trees take a long time to grow
[5:29] <WinMan> Quebec*
[5:29] <Animator> Then I don't think you can grow trees in infdev.
[5:29] <Malikat> like, retarded long
[5:29] <Malikat> you can
[5:29] <gear> what are you doing
[5:29] <Admiral|Splatticus> Tree growing is random.
[5:29] <gear> step by step
[5:29] <Admiral|Splatticus> Sometimes it takes oneday, sometimes two, sometimes three.
[5:29] <Malikat> b) they need to have probably 2 squares in every direction clear
[5:29] <Malikat> with a lot of height
[5:29] <Admiral|Splatticus> Nah, malik.
[5:29] <vurtual> that was old trees
[5:30] <Malikat> c) they need some light

[5:30] <WinMan> god damn alberta
[5:31] <gear> also SubterfugeProfanity just to make sure, what exactly are you planting

[5:50] <Kokopure> LuciferZ, what are you talking about
[5:50] <outsomnia|Clinton> gather a constantly roving warband
[5:50] <vurtual> or the entire quake collection
[5:50] <Kokopure> are you looking for a Minecraft suggestion?
[5:50] <LuciferZ> Okay like, for example

[5:50] <ClassiestMedic> WHERE
[5:51] <vurtual> 49.93 or so for quake, both quake mission packs, quake 2, both of the quake 2 mission packs, quake 3 arena, and quake 3 team arena... or just spend 10 and get quake 2 itself.

[5:51] <outsomnia|Clinton> Recreate the showdown between Richard and Saladin, with a similar about of troops too.
[5:51] <vurtual> the downside is that there's quake live(but hey, I could map now), so I won't play quake 3 much, and I never liked the first quake anyways.
[5:51] <Animator> MP Survival isn't here yet, Medic.
[5:51] <gear> i think
[5:51] <gear> ill dig out a hell chasm

[5:52] <Kokopure> and making two castles
[5:52] <vurtual> and there's no chance I'm going to just buy the mission pack things and quake 2 alone, so that's... less sp fun.
[5:52] <Kokopure> and having one castle try to storm the other castle
[5:52] <KodaichiZero> and I'll just jump into the lava for the lulz

[6:32] <outsomnia|Biden> anyone know how well tnt works on diamond, gold, and steel blocks?
[6:33] <outsomnia|Biden> As in the condensed blocks that cost 9 bars.
[6:33] <LuciferZ> It destroys them.
[6:33] <LuciferZ> Unfortunately.
[6:33] <outsomnia|Biden> Oh wow
[6:33] <eritz> well of course it destroys them, but how many layers of them?
[6:33] <LuciferZ> I hope Notch changes that though.
[6:33] <darkedone02> TnT - kills everything
[6:33] <outsomnia|Biden> Because I know creepers don't do crap to steel blocks.
[6:33] <LuciferZ> I believe the same as stone, Eritz
[6:33] <darkedone02> Ac/Dc style
[6:35] <darkedone02> depending on the radius of explosions, it's best to build a wall that has at least 5 blocks on width.
[6:35] <Malikat> considering that TNT only blows through one layer of cobblestone
[6:35] <outsomnia|Biden> 5 blocks thick wall of diamond, oh man that's going to cost a lot.
[6:35] <darkedone02> no, of cobblestone
[6:36] <darkedone02> who the hell dumb enough to make a diamond wall

[6:41] <darkedone02> that be like wurm online...
[6:42] <gear> only wurm was a pain in the ass to play

[6:51] <LuciferZ> LUKISOD! Use your throwing knife to disarm that TNT!
[6:52] <darkedone02> it be nice if we be able to build onagers or catapults, and other siege weapons on infdev online for sieges.
[6:52] <Lukisod> all in due time I think
[6:53] <darkedone02> although we will have some issues with more floating tiles >_<
[6:53] <darkedone02> i hate floating tiles...
[6:54] <darkedone02> i also wish i can convert 4 dirt into stone or 4 dirt into seeds so that i can get rid of dirt that i never use.
[6:55] <Lukisod> why not just throw the stack off a cliff?
[6:55] <Lukisod> go into your inventory and drag the stack off the inventory and you throw the whole things away
[6:55] <darkedone02> i perfer a use for dirt then it becomes useless except land management
[6:57] <darkedone02> also i wish there was waterfalls infdev.

[7:45] <vurtual> Konogan it made me want morrowind for a moment, because of the sounds reminding me of ultima online
[7:45] <vurtual> then I went back and played the quake II demo again
[7:46] <Tommerry11> ive seen linerider and peggle, peggle looks great, but is line rider easy to control?
[7:46] <LuciferZ> Not at all.
[7:46] <LuciferZ> Probably Peggle, lol.

[7:47] <Konogan> Wow Vurtual, it made you want to play morrowind because the sounds reminded you of Ultima Onlinne? O_o
[7:47] <Rijjka> You know, vurtual, you could probably download a full version of quake two somewhere at this point in time
[7:47] <vurtual> yes
[7:47] <Konogan> How?
[7:47] <vurtual> it brought back all the happy rpg memories
[7:47] <Konogan> Oh, lol.
[7:47] <vurtual> Rijjka, that'd be a bit hypocritical
[7:47] <vurtual> me pirating, after spending years stopping piracy
[7:48] <Konogan> And failing?
[7:48] <vurtual> and spending huuundreds of dollars, no, thousands, on gaming.
[7:48] <Speljohan_> vurtual, i am just as epic
[7:48] <Speljohan_> i hate piracy
[7:48] <LuciferZ> Hypocritical... or plot twist???
[7:48] <Speljohan_> but i pirate myself
[7:48] <Speljohan_> !
[7:48] <Tommerry11> yar har fiddle de de. you are a .... stuff it.
[7:49] <LG_Legacy> Lol
[7:49] <vurtual> I wonder how much I've really spent on gaming
[7:50] <Rijjka> I would point out, that if a game is no longer being printed, then you can't really get it any other way. And some games go into the abandon ware category after some time
[7:50] <vurtual> Rijjka
[7:50] <vurtual> steam.
[7:50] <Azathoth> i hate piracy, but if a game is widely unavailable any other way, i'll pirate it
[7:50] <Rijjka> And frankly, I do resent the pirating point, as I do by all my games
[7:50] <Azathoth> but yeah. you can still get quake easily
[7:50] <Rijjka> And steam, is impossible when one is on dial up, which I am
[7:50] <vurtual> oh come on
[7:50] <Azathoth> dialup!?
[7:50] <vurtual> suck it up
[7:50] <vurtual> my friend has dial-up
[7:50] <vurtual> he still downloads huge garry's mod addons
[7:50] <Azathoth> dialup no longer exists
[7:50] <vurtual> and how can you even pirate on dial-up?
[7:50] <Rijjka> And I'm sure he downloaded Empire total war off of it.

[7:51] <Tommerry11> steam is impossible, whether your on dial-up or broadband (which i am)

[7:51] <thebeast1023> is there any way i can talk to notch right now?
[7:51] <Lukisod> only 1.21gb?
[7:51] <vurtual> Sit around and fart about nothing?
[7:51] <Azathoth> you're*
[7:51] <Rijjka> ooo nice counter tommery.
[7:51] <Azathoth> what's wrong with steam?
[7:51] <Rijjka> I buy the games

[7:52] <Konogan> thebeast, Mail im.
[7:52] <Azathoth> email him
[7:52] <vurtual> Tommerry11, what's your steam problems.
[7:52] <thebeast1023> i did
[7:52] <Tommerry11> steams fine, its just it TRYS to be annoying.
[7:52] <vurtual> tries?
[7:52] <vurtual> How does it "try"?
[7:52] <Azathoth> how does steam try to be annoying?
[7:52] <thebeast1023> does any one know the drill for that kinda thing?
[7:52] <Rijjka> Require a constant login for every game is a bit annoying
[7:52] <thebeast1023> si im prepaired when i get a response
[7:52] <Azathoth> i'll find you his email address -_-
[7:52] <vurtual> Rijjka, constant, no.
[7:52] <Tommerry11> lost password, and it says please insert previous pass code. i went there TO FIND IT.
[7:52] <vurtual> If the network goes down you can continue playing generally
[7:52] <Konogan> the beast, You can use it offline.
[7:52] <vurtual> offline mode was completely fixed up ages ago
[7:53] <vurtual> ...how can you lose a password that easily?
[7:53] <Lukisod> you're just a very slow pirate
[7:53] <Tommerry11> i then remembered it.
[7:53] <vurtual> Honestly, if you're good with not typing your password dumb, you'll never lose it
[7:53] <thebeast1023> konogan what did you mean by that last one
[7:53] <Rijjka> I heard that supprem commander two required a connection every time, or did I miss hear?
[7:53] <Azathoth> that's not steam's fault
[7:54] <Tommerry11> ... auto log in with steam?
[7:54] <Azathoth> steam doesn't require you to be connected if you're in offline mode
[7:54] <vurtual> You can just make a single password, which you change a little bit for sites that might be high-importance
[7:54] <Azathoth> but some games require connections now
[7:54] <Azathoth> blame EA, etc
[7:54] <Lukisod> just remember to update before going offline
[7:54] <vurtual> steam doesn't even require a 24/7 connection at all
[7:54] <vurtual> you can have huge amounts of drops
[7:54] <vurtual> and it'll work fine
[7:54] <Lukisod> I blaim EA, ubisoft and activision
[7:54] <LG_Legacy> Some games require a program
[7:54] <LG_Legacy> Blame steam
[7:54] <Lukisod> steam=awesome
[7:54] <Azathoth> thebeast, i actually can't seem to find his email address... :\
[7:54] <thebeast1023> i think i have it
[7:54] <vurtual> LG_Legacy, steam was made back in 1998, before drm was worth whining about
[7:54] <Azathoth> try coming back in the morning sometime :\
[7:54] <FakeSkyAFK> Steam= Makes Gmod more harder to start up
[7:54] <Lukisod> the only steam games that need steam are valve games and MW2
[7:55] <thebeast1023> i sent to his twitter
[7:55] <Rijjka> So this got completly de-railed no?
[7:55] * FakeSkyAFK is now known as FakeSky

[7:55] <thebeast1023> then his main site
[7:55] <thebeast1023> and found his email there
[7:55] <vurtual> FakeSkyAFK, without steam, garry's mod would not work at all.
[7:55] <Azathoth> steam wasn't made in 1998
[7:55] <vurtual> There'd be no reliable framework to handle mods
[7:55] <Furyhunter> Steam is quite possibly the best drm system ever.
[7:55] <thebeast1023> i have class in the morning
[7:55] <vurtual> Azathoth it's like
[7:55] <Azathoth> steam was made in 2002 or 3
[7:55] <vurtual> 22-oclock
[7:55] <Furyhunter> It does what it was made to do and doesn't impede upon the user at all.
[7:55] <vurtual> and as said I am losing any state of consciousness
[7:55] <Lukisod> back then steam sucked
[7:55] <LG_Legacy> Some games make shitty ways of launching stuff :l
[7:55] <thebeast1023> i wont be home until around 7 pm eastern time
[7:55] <LG_Legacy> Ex: Combat Arms/IJJI
[7:55] <FakeSky> Anyway I still love steam
[7:55] <thebeast1023> i agree lg
[7:56] <Azathoth> seriously. steam is good
[7:56] <LG_Legacy> The first time i tried to install AVA
[7:56] <thebeast1023> combat and ijji have shit ways to launch games
[7:56] <LG_Legacy> I had to install tis Reactor shit
[7:56] <thebeast1023> g2g
[7:56] <vurtual> anyways guys
[7:56] <thebeast1023> peace
[7:56] <LG_Legacy> And the end result?
[7:56] <thebeast1023> thanks for help
[7:56] <LG_Legacy> It failed epiclly

[7:56] <vurtual> Azathoth
[7:56] <vurtual> dial-up's pretty big
[7:56] <vurtual> I know a huge amount of people with it
[7:57] <vurtual> I'm the only person with a non-dialup connection in this huge area
[7:57] <Azathoth> dialup is only going to get smaller...
[7:57] <Azathoth> it's only big in rural areas
[7:57] <vurtual> rural areas are pretty big
[7:57] <vurtual> most of them don't even comprehend that the internet can function without a phone call
[7:57] <Azathoth> and as far as target audiences for games go, most have broadband
[7:57] <Rijjka> That's because no body wants to sink the money into getting us some real internet.
[7:57] <Lukisod> get some wifi and pirate the internet
[7:58] <Rijjka> Yeah, yeah, you know, cause wifi comes out into the country too.
[7:58] <Tommerry11> I have sattlite and IT SUCKS.
[7:58] <Speljohan_> dialup doesnt even exist in sweden anymore
[7:58] <Speljohan_> lol
[7:58] <Rijjka> You go too far, that's not a option.
[7:58] <Speljohan_> not to my knowledge anyways
[7:58] <vurtual> dial-up's more expensive than dsl here
[7:58] <Rijjka> Yes, sattlite does suck. I had it too, too expensive
[7:58] <Speljohan_> yeah, is probably same here
[7:58] <Speljohan_> if it still exists
[7:58] <vurtual> infact I don't think you can even get a new dial-up here
[7:58] <Speljohan_> yeah it's pointless
[7:58] <Speljohan_> everyone can get adsl2+ anyway
[7:58] <Rijjka> Are are you at anyway Vurtual?
[7:59] <Tommerry11> im having it until we can get something other than dial up. its my only option.
[7:59] <vurtual> what
[7:59] <Azathoth> face it. dial-up is going to be virtually nonexistant in a decade or so
[7:59] <Rijjka> We hope so.
[7:59] <gear> dial up.. still exists?
[7:59] <Azathoth> the internet has already left them behind
[7:59] <Rijjka> *facepalm*
[7:59] <Azathoth> i can't imagine even loading most web sites on a dialup connection. it must be hell
[7:59] <vurtual> Azathoth it's not a problem at all
[8:00] <vurtual> dial-up's main problem is the phone-interruption thing
[8:00] <LuciferZ> Fuck yer, I am now 20.
[8:00] <Rijjka> Yeah, not really, with the expecption of taking a long time for videos, it's not that bad
[8:00] <Speljohan_> websites were much better during dial-up days though
[8:00] <Azathoth> happy birthday?
[8:00] <LuciferZ> :D
[8:00] <Speljohan_> thesedays they are all bloated
[8:00] <Speljohan_> full of crap
[8:00] <Speljohan_> flash and other useless shit
[8:00] <Rijjka> And those kill my connection.
[8:00] <Rijjka> And my experince if i happen to be in town
[8:01] <vurtual> things still load quickl-dooobepbobopbopbbop wrrr dodpdoppppp ddeeeoooooohhhhhhhpp onddnndnnnczkkkkchhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiizzzzwzwwzzSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[8:01] <Speljohan_> lol
[8:01] <Trapiki> ...wat
[8:01] <Speljohan_> i'm on a fairly slow connection atm
[8:01] <Speljohan_> 24/1
[8:01] <vurtual> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qtqz0bdq30Q
[8:01] <Azathoth> also, about 82% of people in america live in urban areas
[8:01] <Speljohan_> moving to stockholm this fall though
[8:01] <Azathoth> urban areas typically have broadband access
[8:01] <Speljohan_> so i'm getting 100/100 instead
[8:01] <Speljohan_> :>
[8:02] <vurtual> Rural areas have the best internet.
[8:02] <Konogan> Yup we have.
[8:02] <vurtual> Provided you can get dsl, you'll not deal with pesky limits and blocks
[8:02] <Azathoth> so saying that rural areas are pretty big is a bit of an overstatement as far as populations...
[8:02] <Rijjka> Azathoth, that may be true, but might I ask, would you be suggesting that everyone who wants better internet move to urban areas?
[8:02] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) Quit (Quit: bye peoples.)
[8:02] <Azathoth> negative
[8:03] <Rijjka> Ahhh good
[8:03] <Azathoth> you'll get your chance eventually
[8:03] <vurtual> urban areas are full of lame people anyways
[8:03] <Rijjka> Oh so I hold out hope
[8:03] <Codlike> we only just got informed that we had adsl2 ports installed at our exchange for our provider
[8:03] <Azathoth> you seriously can't get cable internet where you are?
[8:03] <Speljohan_> adsl1 doesnt exist here anymore
[8:03] <Speljohan_> it was replaced a year back or so
[8:03] <Codlike> so we're waiting to get put on adsl2
[8:04] <Lukisod> it's hard to put cables out to everyones house in rural areas
[8:04] <Rijjka> I can't get anything other then satilite, which is... lack luster at best
[8:04] <Codlike> which we've had adsl1 since mid last year
[8:04] <vurtual> you know
[8:04] <Azathoth> i used to live outside the city limits of a town with a population of 8000, and we got cable internet like 7 years ago
[8:04] <Speljohan_> lol same Azathoth
[8:04] <Speljohan_> i live 20km from town
[8:04] <Rijjka> And lukisod hit the nail on the head.
[8:04] <Speljohan_> and can still get 24/1 connection
[8:04] <vurtual> if they sent me the spool, some clips, and I had a ladder truck
[8:04] <Speljohan_> 8km from the exchange
[8:04] <vurtual> I'd manually run a fiber optic cable along the powerlines
[8:04] <Azathoth> you must live in the boondocks
[8:04] <Speljohan_> i live in the forest"
[8:04] <Speljohan_> with trolls
[8:04] <Rijjka> I'm about... 50 k out. And the goverment is mucknig about in the internet, which is keeping out otherwise valid competition
[8:05] <Speljohan_> and magical creatures
[8:05] <Speljohan_> like unicorns
[8:05] <Rijjka> Wow, All I got is bears and moose.
[8:05] <Rijjka> That must be sweet
[8:05] <Codlike> apparently Telstra was told to not allow many adsl2 ports in our exchange
[8:05] <vurtual> Hmm, I wonder if I could get people to play quake 2 demo mp with me.
[8:05] <Codlike> to eliminate reasons of competition
[8:06] <Lukisod> why only the demo
[8:06] <Rijjka> Well I've got the full quake two, not a demo, are they compatiable?
[8:06] <chibifs> vurtual, why don't you just play quake live?
[8:06] <Rijjka> Course... I'd have to find it.
[8:06] <Konogan> Vurtual, A shame I only have the full version.
[8:06] <vurtual> OH COME ON
[8:06] <Azathoth> i live in a metropolitan area with a populaiton of 1.7 million million now. it's so wonderful after living in that tiny little town
[8:06] <Konogan> LOL
[8:06] <vurtual> AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO NEVER GOT QUAKE 2
[8:06] <vurtual> SERIOUSLY
[8:06] <Azathoth> only one million there .<
[8:06] <Rijjka> Yes.
[8:06] <Speljohan_> probably vurtual
[8:06] <vurtual> I thought it'd be one of the games I'd have that nobody else would
[8:06] <Speljohan_> but quake 1 was far superior
[8:06] <Rijjka> ;)
[8:06] <chibifs> Play Quake Live :(
[8:06] <Lukisod> I could get quake 2 in maybe... 5-10 minutes
[8:06] <vurtual> same with jc2 I thought, shockingly not
[8:06] <Speljohan_> but quake 1 was far superior
[8:06] <Speljohan_> but quake 1 was far superior
[8:06] <Azathoth> not 1.7 million million. that would be a lot of people
[8:06] <Lukisod> it's called google, and piracy
[8:06] <vurtual> Speljohan_, too creepy.
[8:07] <Speljohan_> that's what i loved about it vurtual !
[8:07] <vurtual> and the level design wasn't as fun
[8:07] <Speljohan_> but oh the horror
[8:07] <Rijjka> What about quake 4? what were you're thoughts?
[8:07] <vurtual> also the grenadelauncher enemies were far too not horribly annoying
[8:07] <Speljohan_> made up for all flaws
[8:07] <Speljohan_> quake 4 sucked
[8:07] <Speljohan_> just like doom 3
[8:07] <vurtual> It wasn't scary
[8:07] <vurtual> it was just like
[8:07] <Azathoth> i never played any of the quake games
[8:07] <Lukisod> doom3 was skary
[8:07] <Azathoth> except for 3 a little bit and 4
[8:07] <Konogan> We're only like 2K in my town :P
[8:07] <Azathoth> i liked quake 4
[8:07] <Lukisod> quake 4 wasn't fun
[8:07] <vurtual> "WHY DID THEY HAVE TO DESIGN THE GAME LIKE THIS IT SERVES NO VALID PURPOSE WHATSOEVER."
[8:07] <Azathoth> but then i'm a sucker for anything sci fi
[8:07] <Rijjka> I never bothered with doom.
[8:07] <Speljohan_> they should have kept the quake 1 story
[8:07] <Rijjka> I didn't want scary, I want guns!
[8:08] <Speljohan_> quake 1 story was best
[8:08] <Lukisod> i dind't know quake had a story
[8:08] <Konogan> What story?
[8:08] <Rijjka> And sci-fi, like Azathoth said, I too have weak spot for sci-fi
[8:08] <vurtual> quake was like doom
[8:08] <gear> so far
[8:08] <vurtual> except this time, you're teleporting around to kill things
[8:08] <vurtual> in three deee
[8:08] <Rijjka> Alien invasino ring any bells?
[8:08] <Rijjka> *invasion
[8:08] <Rijjka> Dang
[8:08] <gear> ive mine several cubic fucktons of rock
[8:08] <Lukisod> everyone should go back to wolfenstien
[8:08] <Lukisod> or at least duke nukem 3d
[8:08] <vurtual> HEY GUYS DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PIRATE
[8:09] <vurtual> YOU LEAVE BEHIND NO OLD GAMES
[8:09] <Konogan> Is there a wolfeinstein online mod? That would be awesome.
[8:09] <Rijjka> holy crap, .76k download rate for mine craft, what the heck happened!
[8:09] <vurtual> EVERYONE WILL HATE YOU FOR BEING THAT GUY WHO PIRATED
[8:09] <Rijjka> Vurtual, I will point out, I bought quake 2
[8:09] <vurtual> AND THEN THEY NEVER GOT TO BE INCLUDED INTO THE FUN
[8:09] <vurtual> so never pirate.
[8:09] <Rijjka> Which apparently you didn't.
[8:09] <Speljohan_> quake 1 was based off H.P. Lovecraft lore
[8:09] <Lukisod> I buy several hundread dollars of game a year
[8:09] <vurtual> steam is debatable
[8:09] <Speljohan_> which is why it was scary + awesome
[8:09] <Lukisod> but I also pirate
[8:09] <Lukisod> I've pirated and then bought
[8:10] <vurtual> seriously I've never encountered old pc games lying around, ever.
[8:10] <vurtual> like, never, not even once.
[8:10] <Rijjka> I use it as a try before you buy system really, if I like it, I buy it.
[8:10] <eritz> i pirate like the fist of the north star
[8:10] <vurtual> our old consoles are mostly gone because they were sold, but never a game
[8:10] <eritz> but i buy stuff sometimes too
[8:10] <Rijjka> If it's carp, I wouldn't want to waste money on it.
[8:10] <Lukisod> http://www.abandonwarering.com/
[8:10] <Speljohan_> i rarely play games anymore
[8:10] <Rijjka> *crap
[8:10] <Speljohan_> hence, i rarely download or buy
[8:10] <Lukisod> theres a bunch of old games for free
[8:10] <vurtual> real men play demos
[8:10] <Rijjka> Not carp
[8:10] <vurtual> Lukisod
[8:10] <eritz> i'm preparing a game for myself right now, in fact
[8:10] <vurtual> that's still warez
[8:10] <Rijjka> It'd be weird if a game was about carp.
[8:10] <Speljohan_> i tend to download music however
[8:10] <Speljohan_> but then, i always buy it
[8:10] <Speljohan_> lol
[8:10] <vurtual> abandonware means "it's illegal."
[8:10] <Rijjka> Unless we're talking about dwarf fortress.
[8:11] <Lukisod> anyone remember seamen for dreamcast?
[8:11] <vurtual> carp are no longer hardcore
[8:11] <vurtual> it's draltha
[8:11] <vurtual> seaman is next to my dreamcast
[8:11] <vurtual> I did not play because have no memorycard thingies
[8:11] <Rijjka> That is true
[8:11] <Lukisod> lol
[8:11] <Rijjka> I lost my miners to the bloody Draltha
[8:11] <vurtual> I lost a fort
[8:11] <vurtual> it didn't die
[8:11] <eritz> abandonware is abandonware because nobody really owns the rights to it anymore
[8:11] <Rijjka> Who knew grazers we're so hardcore?
[8:11] <vurtual> no matter how grave the wounds, it did a savage blow
[8:11] <eritz> since nobody owns the rights, nobody can sue over it
[8:11] <vurtual> eventually it had made my wrestlers legendary
[8:11] <vurtual> but was also supposedly legendary as it threw people into walls, killing the
[8:11] <vurtual> them*
[8:12] <Rijjka> My axemen chased it for a good month around the living quarters. Finaly cut it in two... but of course, not before killing all the important dudes.
[8:13] <vurtual> Rijjka I had no axe men
[8:13] <vurtual> :(
[8:13] <vurtual> so I flooded half the fort
[8:13] <vurtual> cautiously sealing off most of the sectors first
[8:13] * Subhazard|wallflower (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft

[8:13] <Rijjka> I only had one because he showed up migrating.
[8:13] <Subhazard|wallflower> LuciferZ
[8:13] * Subhazard|wallflower is now known as Subhazard
[8:13] <LuciferZ> Subhazard
[8:13] <Bomb_Spammer> What
[8:13] <Subhazard> I need you two in my thread.
[8:13] <Bomb_Spammer> REPORTING IN
[8:13] <Subhazard> It's weak as fuck now.
[8:13] <Bomb_Spammer> It's still alive?
[8:13] <Subhazard> Yes.
[8:14] <LuciferZ> Sure thing.
[8:14] <Bomb_Spammer> I thought it died after HURR UR MEEN NO U HUGS
[8:14] <Subhazard> I busted some lips.
[8:14] <LuciferZ> I'm about to start streaming some indev asskicking, I could do some verbal first.
[8:14] <Subhazard> Things are ripe for building.
[8:14] <Subhazard> You do indev streaming?
[8:14] <LuciferZ> About to start, lol.
[8:15] <LuciferZ> But I got dibs on first reply

[8:15] <LuciferZ> So I can get Alpha gooood
[8:15] <Rijjka> Mmmm... if I had money right now, I'd have a premium membership. Indev sounds fun.,
[8:15] <Subhazard> It's so much better..
[8:15] <Lukisod> indev = win
[8:15] <Subhazard> that's is hard to show people minecraft.
[8:15] <vurtual> it's not a membership
[8:15] <Subhazard> Because survival sucks so hard in comparison
[8:15] <vurtual> for this I must punish you
[8:15] * vurtual grabs all of Rijjka's legit games and runs for a safehouse
[8:15] <Subhazard> I can't be like 'Oh, just play Survival' 'Well this is boring' 'So buy it'
[8:16] * Lukisod pirates games to replace rijjka's
[8:16] * vurtual gets out his anti-piracy gear
[8:16] <Rijjka> Any chance of it being downloadable as a stand alone app in the future perchance?
[8:16] <Lukisod> mention that it will be twice as expensive in beta
[8:16] <Subhazard> Most likely.
[8:16] <Lukisod> people love to not pay money
[8:16] <vurtual> A shotgun, some shotgun shells, an ATV, a mountain dew.
[8:17] <Rijjka> I'd rather not have to keep downloading it if I don't have to.
[8:17] <vurtual> Altogether a classy redneck smackdown

[8:18] <Rijjka> But... but... my boxes, my manuals!
[8:18] <Rijjka> Those are shiney!
[8:18] <Subhazard> Because sometimes I want to listen to Massive Attack, and sometimes I want to listen to Black Sun Empire.
[8:18] <Subhazard> Have those two next to each other however, is not condusive to any sustained mood
[8:18] <eritz> music does need mood filtering
[8:18] <vurtual> you know, if I knew that they actually carried them, I could go to my nearby gas station and get prepaid cards and entirely circumvent the whole "no credit card" thing.
[8:19] <LuciferZ> Kay, who's next?
[8:19] <Rijjka> And vurtual, correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't one need to buy the premium deally to play indev?
[8:19] <vurtual> yes
[8:19] <Subhazard> lol LuciferZ I am so surprised I'm able to type that well when I'm drunk.
[8:19] <Subhazard> Like
[8:19] <Subhazard> The screen was a fucking BLUR
[8:19] <Rijjka> That's all I was commenting on, that if I had moeny at the moment, I'd buy it
[8:19] <LuciferZ> Lol. Nice.
[8:19] <vurtual> hmm
[8:19] <Subhazard> But I concentrated as hard as I could to put that on the post.
[8:20] * EmpiresBane (EmpiresBan@pool-71-111-57-17.ptldor.dsl-w.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[8:20] <vurtual> Maybe once I learn to drive, I'd get my own mountain dew, and also get those cards.
[8:20] <Rijjka> The other was a unrealted question, on if minecraft would ever come out as a stand alone ap in the future.
[8:20] <Subhazard> I can do the straight line test when I'm completely trashed.
[8:20] <vurtual> then again me actually being able to drive a car is less likely than me suddenly becoming a valve dev and getting free games.
[8:20] <vurtual> Cars are scary. :(
[8:20] <EmpiresBane> Gmod is annoying me...
[8:20] <LuciferZ> Wait what
[8:20] <FakeSky> Why?
[8:20] <vurtual> EmpiresBane, your computer sucks
[8:20] <vurtual> Seriously how do you guys do that whole driving thing?
[8:21] <EmpiresBane> the freaking spawn menu won't stay open
[8:21] <EmpiresBane> it just randomly closes
[8:21] <vurtual> hold the button
[8:21] <EmpiresBane> i do
[8:21] <vurtual> hold. button.
[8:21] <LuciferZ> Vurtual you molested my consciousness with tales of fucking a gear shift
[8:21] <LuciferZ> And you can't even drive?
[8:21] <EmpiresBane> oh god!
[8:21] <vurtual> no, I cannot handle cars well
[8:21] <LuciferZ> hurhurhur
[8:21] <vurtual> in games yes, only because I can drive anywhere easily.
[8:21] <EmpiresBane> that's sad...
[8:21] <vurtual> no laws or lines to follow, or speed limits
[8:22] <EmpiresBane> driving isn't that hard
[8:22] <vurtual> or unrelenting fear of accidentally killing everyone
[8:22] <Rijjka> Vurtual, the secert of driving, is get a bigger old car. If it's built like a brick, you feel like you're driving a tank
[8:22] <vurtual> I may be a gun-weilding redneck but I still start mentally breaking down into fear every time I do have a gun.
[8:22] <Subhazard> I drive like a bull in a china shop: Surprisingly well.
[8:22] <Rijjka> And as such, a invinciblity complex takes over, at least until you crash and learn why air bags are good
[8:22] <vurtual> for now I'll stick to light and maneuverable forms of transportation
[8:22] <TestDummy> Assuming this big, old car even has them. ._.
[8:23] <EmpiresBane> except when you have to look for a taco bell, watch the light, pay attention to the retard behind you, and listen your mom yelling at you
[8:23] <vurtual> like bikes, ATVs, planes.
[8:23] <EmpiresBane> than it gets a little harder
[8:23] <TestDummy> That's what she said.
[8:23] <EmpiresBane> my laptop doesn't have a numpad...
[8:23] <Lukisod> numpads are for pussies
[8:23] <vurtual> +gm_special
[8:24] <vurtual> and a numkey
[8:24] <vurtual> or like gm_special_whatever
[8:24] <EmpiresBane> ???
[8:24] <vurtual> bind random keys to numpad keys
[8:24] <vurtual> I actually have my G key do num 4 form e
[8:25] <EmpiresBane> holy shit! white room!
[8:25] <outsomnia|Biden> Does your N key do your taxes?
[8:25] <outsomnia|Biden> White room what?
[8:25] <EmpiresBane> a white room
[8:25] <outsomnia|Biden> in, what?
[8:25] <vurtual> no that's my quick load key outsomnia|Biden
[8:25] <EmpiresBane> in your mom
[8:25] <Subhazard> Would anyone be so kind as to buy me some minutes for my phone? :(
[8:25] <Subhazard> It's completely out.
[8:26] <vurtual> If I had some kind of tangible transferable magical phone minutes I'd give them to you
[8:26] <Lukisod> how much are minutes?
[8:26] <vurtual> because I have no phone
[8:26] <vurtual> someone tried to give me an old phone
[8:26] <vurtual> I'm like "no way"
[8:27] <Rijjka> Anyway, I'ma afk to go builda pyramid
[8:27] <vurtual> Outright did not let them try to entitle it to me in any way, or even set it in my room.
[8:27] <Subhazard> They're 30 bucks for a 300 card.
[8:27] <vurtual> absolute garbage
[8:27] <Subhazard> Which is the cheapest :(
[8:27] <EmpiresBane> JESUS!
[8:27] <vurtual> Subhazard if you can get someone to pay 30 bucks for your phone minutes
[8:27] <Lukisod> you're getting screwed
[8:27] <EmpiresBane> those are freaking expensive!
[8:27] <outsomnia|Biden> http://i41.tinypic.com/111te2e.jpg
[8:27] <outsomnia|Biden> White room what?
[8:27] <vurtual> I'd have a chance at getting people to buy me games easily
[8:28] <Subhazard> I know, but I'm stuck with this phone until I get a better job.
[8:28] <LuciferZ> Subhazard, TracPhone?
[8:28] <Subhazard> Was just shooting it out there, incase anyone felt generous.
[8:28] <vurtual> Subhazard, why do you need a phone at all?
[8:28] <Subhazard> Nope, Net10
[8:28] <LuciferZ> Oh yeah
[8:28] <LuciferZ> I think I have an old TracPhone card with liek 60 minutes on it. Sorry bro.
[8:28] <Subhazard> I need a phone because I work with this outreach program where I help the street youth.
[8:28] <Subhazard> I also have a social life.
[8:28] <vurtual> Subhazard, do you have a laptop?
[8:28] <Subhazard> Yes.
[8:29] <vurtual> does skype work with normal phones at all?
[8:29] <Subhazard> Yes, but it costs money.
[8:29] * EmpiresBane (EmpiresBan@pool-71-111-57-17.ptldor.dsl-w.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving)
[8:29] <vurtual> cheaper than 30 bucks for 300 minutes?
[8:29] <Subhazard> I need something on my person.
[8:29] <Subhazard> And I don't call that much.
[8:29] <vurtual> laptops can be on your person
[8:29] <vurtual> I take a laptop everywhere
[8:29] <Subhazard> That 30 bucks will last me a month or two.
[8:29] <vurtual> granted I rarely go anywhere that requires walking around alot
[8:29] <Subhazard> Vurtual
[8:29] <Subhazard> I live in Seattle.
[8:29] <Subhazard> I spend 90% of my day walking, uphill.
[8:30] <vurtual> both ways?
[8:30] <Subhazard> Sometimes.
[8:30] <Subhazard> Whelp, I thought I'd ask.
[8:30] <vurtual> I think, maybe, just maybe, I'm now addicted to games
[8:30] <vurtual> I've gone a while without playing any games just fine but
[8:31] <Malikat> more like
[8:31] <Malikat> just cause
[8:31] <vurtual> not being able to play a game I want to play seems to result in a state of being sick, and my muscles, when relaxed, go entirely limp
[8:31] <vurtual> it's like a very warm dead person
[8:32] <Subhazard> That sounds like a health issue.
[8:32] <Subhazard> Shouldn't have anything to do with your love of games.
[8:32] <vurtual> this only happens in situations like extreme boredom
[8:32] <vurtual> (now nearly gone since I've got some eternally fun games all the time)
[8:32] <Subhazard> that's just plain ol' malaise/lethargy
[8:32] <vurtual> but nostalgia overpowers it

[8:33] <vurtual> if I'm having fun(which is hard to do), it entirely goes away for that moment
[8:33] <Subhazard> I hate that I'm able to connect to IRC no problem
[8:33] <Subhazard> But my internet is slower than tar.
[8:34] <Konogan> Vurtual, I kind of understand.
[8:34] <vurtual> I'd assume exhaustion is causing it but I've just slept a massive amount, gotten the most rest I've had in a long time
[8:34] <vurtual> I normally dno't go to sleep for hours later than this, it's only 9:30
[8:34] <vurtual> and I don't get any kind of lethargy-like exhaustion from physical exhaustion
[8:35] <Subhazard> You might have overslept
[8:35] <Konogan> Lol.
[8:35] <Subhazard> Which is something I am very experienced with.
[8:35] <Subhazard> Because I do a lot of sleep dep
[8:35] <vurtual> infact I've never actually had any serious problems with any physical or mental exhaustion before
[8:35] <Subhazard> It's no joke, you can oversleep
[8:35] <vurtual> I know what oversleeping is
[8:35] <Subhazard> Not you.
[8:35] <Konogan> Yeah.

[8:52] <vurtual> that bug rocks dude
[8:53] <vurtual> anyways I'm officially unable to contain coherent thought while multitasking
[8:53] <Subhazard> What bug
[8:53] <vurtual> game over yeaaaaaaaaah
[8:53] <KodaichiZero> urgh
[8:53] <KodaichiZero> gear said some video was jap techno... I don't blame him, but it was actually italian
[8:53] <vurtual> oh no oh no
[8:53] <vurtual> we're doomed
[8:54] <vurtual> panic panic panic panic
[8:54] <KodaichiZero> whatever
[8:54] <gear> i couldnt actually load the video
[8:54] <gear> as i was downloading
[8:54] <gear> so i judged it
[8:54] <KodaichiZero> lol
[8:54] <gear> probably unfairly
[8:54] <vurtual> so guys
[8:54] <vurtual> why can't flash hold the mouse in place
[8:55] <KodaichiZero> umm
[8:55] <KodaichiZero> never had that problem vurt
[8:55] <KodaichiZero> OH
[8:55] <KodaichiZero> I know what you mean
[8:55] <vurtual> I mean, I've seen lots of flash shooters
[8:55] <KodaichiZero> I think it just doesn't have that kind of power
[8:55] <vurtual> but none of them hold the mouse
[8:55] <vurtual> that and javascript
[8:55] <vurtual> well, browser-based quakes
[8:56] <KodaichiZero> lol quake yeah I don't even know what that game's coded in

[8:56] <KodaichiZero> I assumed it was java

[8:56] <KodaichiZero> that would make the most sense
[8:56] <vurtual> also that html5-powered quake 2 had that problem apparently

[8:57] <KodaichiZero> html5-powered? that doesn't sound good
[8:57] <vurtual> it worked well

[8:57] <vurtual> I guessed a song properly subconsciously, while thinking it was another one
[8:57] <vurtual> pick, Qloos
[8:57] <vurtual> pick.
[8:57] <Qloos> How do I get a pick if I cant smelt one?
[8:57] <KodaichiZero> well rpg maker is based off of Ruby, a language made mostly for text, so what do I know
[8:57] <vurtual> wood
[8:57] <vurtual> and stone later
[8:58] <vurtual> KodaichiZero, if you're talking weirdly-used programming languages
[8:58] <vurtual> people do full 3D games in game maker
[8:58] <KodaichiZero> lol
[8:58] <FNugget> Subhazard: bug is, footstep sounds dont happen when you're bounding down stairs, and they all collect when you stop moving at the bottom of it
[8:58] <vurtual> granted, they rarely have an amazing use of 3D space

[9:01] <KodaichiZero> music always sounds better with the volume at full
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> I don't know why but it does
[9:01] <vurtual> because you can hear more of it
[9:01] <KodaichiZero> especially if it has bass like thunder
[9:01] <Lukisod> with the bass up at max
[9:01] <Lukisod> yeah... what zero said
[9:02] <KodaichiZero> THUD THUD THUD TUHD
[9:02] <KodaichiZero> geez I love that feeling
[9:02] <vurtual> so here's a fun fact
[9:02] <vurtual> my laptop has way worse speakers than my nice bose desktop ones
[9:02] <vurtual> BUT, my laptop has a subwoofer
[9:03] <vurtual> confusing.
[9:03] <KodaichiZero> ouch
[9:03] <KodaichiZero> that kinda sucks
[9:03] <KodaichiZero> better get some gewd speakers for your laptop
[9:03] <vurtual> well my bose ones are reallly high quality
[9:03] <vurtual> you can never hear any sound degrdation at all
[9:04] <KodaichiZero> I'm probably going to have this headset forever

[9:05] <vurtual> my speakers are generally on the same directional position as my shower temp
[9:05] <vurtual> around 25% or so
[9:05] <vurtual> anything more can be unbearably loud/hot
[9:05] <vurtual> WHAT IS THE OTHER 75% FOR THOUGH
[9:05] <KodaichiZero> oh you mean the perfect setting. yeah I know what you mean
[9:05] <KodaichiZero> that's for pissing off the neighbours
[9:05] <vurtual> how can turning it up to 30% on my shower CAUSE BURN MARKIS

[9:21] <vurtual> that was hard
[9:22] <Lukisod> you know what else is hard...
[9:22] <vurtual> my nipples whe nI tried to make them cold to press keys better?
[9:22] <Lukisod> exactly
[9:22] <vurtual> your erection when you imagined that?
[9:22] <vurtual> SUPER MARIO BROS!?
[9:22] <Lukisod> only possibly
[9:23] <vurtual> so guys if aliens attacked from portals
[9:23] <vurtual> not aware of our culture
[9:23] <vurtual> how long before someone tries to go all doom/quake on them?
[9:23] <Lukisod> however long it took me to get to the base and get my gun uploaded
[9:23] <Lukisod> so...
[9:23] <eritz> Seven Hour War
[9:24] <vurtual> eritz, gordon freeman
[9:24] <Lukisod> 30-40 minutes tops
[9:24] <eritz> freeman doesn't participate in the Seven Hour War
[9:24] <outsomnia|Biden> A day, and then the next where they start spamming their nuke-gatlings at you.
[9:24] <vurtual> well gordon was forcably held away

[9:25] <outsomnia|Biden> >implying the aliens don't also have sheer awesomeness themselves
[9:25] <outsomnia|Biden> hurp
[9:25] <vurtual> Lukisod, I counter with the quake chaingun physics
[9:25] <vurtual> scout with sasha
[9:25] <outsomnia|Biden> v_<
[9:25] <vurtual> outsomnia|Biden, if they did have human hardcore heroic skills
[9:25] <vurtual> they'd know they cannot invade another society and win
[9:25] <vurtual> and that conventional warfare does not work anymore
[9:25] <outsomnia|Biden> The Krikket empire sure proved that wrong.
[9:25] <eritz> would humans use the Doom comic as propaganda?
[9:26] <eritz> RIP AND TEAR
[9:26] <vurtual> no
[9:26] <vurtual> they'd use independence day
[9:26] <outsomnia|Biden> Why invade when you can detonate a star system's sun from a well aways off?
[9:26] <eritz> you're invading because you want something
[9:26] <eritz> duh
[9:26] <Lukisod> why invade when you can throw a kilometer sized chunk of rock at the earth?
[9:26] <eritz> most likely liquid water
[9:26] <vurtual> or like, war of the worlds
[9:27] <Lukisod> collect water from the blast
[9:27] <vurtual> also trying to nuke a planet from afar never works
[9:27] <outsomnia|Biden> Why invade wh-BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!
[9:27] <vurtual> they'll shoot it down duh
[9:27] <vurtual> liquid water's easy to make
[9:27] <vurtual> like, really easy
[9:27] <eritz> so is beer
[9:27] <eritz> dpesmn
[9:27] <Lukisod> if it's blood for the blood god then we have to hope the emperor emerges soon

[9:29] <Lukisod> now theres only a few billion
[9:29] <Lukisod> we're fine
[9:29] <eritz> honestly, if extraterrestrials visit us, it'll probably be for the purposes of checking up on the ant farm they seeded about 20,000,000 years ago
[9:29] <vurtual> and quake in 1996!?
[9:29] <vurtual> eritz, yeah that Argentenian ant farm is pretty massive
[9:29] <LuciferZ> Okay I stopped streaming because I don't have a mic
[9:29] <LuciferZ> But Subhazard is streaming now
[9:29] <outsomnia|Biden> Eritz, either that or the UFO's we've seen so far are just drunken tourists passing by and messing with us for shits and giggles.

[9:31] <Lukisod> werd
[9:32] <Drewseph> I tend to dig in a line
[9:32] <Trapiki> that's in indev, I cant play infdev at them moment :C
[9:32] <vurtual> If aliens wanted to appease me they'd have to like, send me videogames
[9:32] <vurtual> then again sending someone a game about fighting aliens isn't exactly a sane thing

[9:33] <outsomnia|Biden> All they'd have to do is just open you and then pour it in.
[9:33] <outsomnia|Biden> Shaken, not stirred.

[9:44] <vurtual> it'd be funny if notch implemented grenade-like liquid shock
[9:44] <outsomnia|Biden> But, I'm beneath solid iron.
[9:45] <vurtual> any explosion hitting underwater would deal super-ranged damage
[9:45] <vurtual> you'll still destroy some water and get a breath of air
[9:45] <outsomnia|Biden> And everyone knows tnt when you hit it is affected by gravity.

[13:12] <vurtual> most rtses suck though Speljohan_
[13:13] <vurtual> and then the gaming community still hasn't said sorry for what they said about force commander
[13:13] <Speljohan_> most modern rts's suck yes
[13:13] <Speljohan_> because they have been so fuckin oversaturated

[13:17] <vurtual> How many RTSes do you remember as being incredible?
[13:17] <vurtual> How many amazing RTSes do you play?
[13:17] <Speljohan_> aoe1, aoe2, rise of nations, empire earth, total annihilation
[13:17] <Speljohan_> that's about it
[13:17] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:18] <Subhazard> Oh god.
[13:18] <Subhazard> I just pulled off the most epic move ever in minecraft.
[13:18] <vurtual> Most people can sorta go "Well, starcraft was cool.", while having hardly played starcraft. There's those other history-based ones nobody can name the genre of.
[13:18] <vurtual> Then there's the mildly less pouplar Total Annihilation.
[13:18] <vurtual> the two biggest there are from 1998
[13:18] <Speljohan_> TA was 1996 or 1997 btw
[13:18] <Speljohan_> it predates starcraft
[13:18] <Subhazard> I was digging around and then I hit an underwater lake. I started OUTRUNNING THE WATER PLACING COBBLESTONE BLOCKS AS I WENT, and I managed to stop the torrent of water from flooding my entire underwater base.
[13:18] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:18] <Subhazard> underground base*
[13:18] <vurtual> sep 30 1997
[13:18] <Speljohan_> for the record, i dont like starcraft
[13:19] <vurtual> You must construct additiona pylons
[13:19] <vurtual> pylons pylons pylons pylons pylons pylons pylons pylons pylons pylons pylons
[13:19] <Speljohan_> too much asian micromanagement for my taste
[13:19] <Speljohan_> etc
[13:19] <Speljohan_> aoe2 is probably the best balanced rts ever tho
[13:19] <Speljohan_> and most entertaining by far
[13:19] * vurtual is now known as Aldaris
[13:19] <Aldaris> You must construct additional pylons, Speljohan_.
[13:19] <Aldaris> One of uuuus
[13:19] <Speljohan_> oh, and how can i forget mentioning warcraft 3
[13:20] <Speljohan_> what a piece of trash that game was
[13:20] <Speljohan_> from an rts perspective
[13:20] <Aldaris> Join us in the psionic link.
[13:20] <Speljohan_> no
[13:20] <Speljohan_> we are borg, you will be assimilated
[13:20] <Speljohan_> resistance is futile.
[13:20] <Aldaris> what happens if the zerg and borg mixed
[13:20] * Aldaris is now known as vurtual
[13:21] <Speljohan_> we will add your distinctiveness to our own

[13:22] <vurtual> anyways rtses are few and far-inbetween
[13:22] <vurtual> that an 4x games
[13:22] <vurtual> but fpses it's like we can't stop shooting things I guess.
[13:22] <Speljohan_> truths
[13:22] <Speljohan_> except i dont like any fps's
[13:23] <Speljohan_> except cod2
[13:23] <Speljohan_> and the classics
[13:23] <Speljohan_> like quake1 and 2
[13:23] <vurtual> ...sorry sir
[13:23] <vurtual> is half-life in those classics?
[13:23] <Speljohan_> nope

[13:23] <vurtual> then I'm sorry but you are clinically insane.
[13:23] <IDTL> Goddamn locks in oblivion
[13:23] <Speljohan_> i mostly dislike fps's because i suck at aiming
[13:23] <IDTL> can't pick them for shit
[13:23] <vurtual> Half-Life and Half-Life 2 were some of the best games ever.
[13:23] <Speljohan_> and have shakey hand
[13:23] <IDTL> Half-life 2 was okay
[13:23] <vurtual> like, seriously
[13:23] <IDTL> episode 2 is my favorite
[13:23] <Speljohan_> i very much prefer rts's
[13:23] <vurtual> half-life 2 I just replay
[13:23] <vurtual> I finish it
[13:23] <Speljohan_> and 4x games
[13:24] <vurtual> then I just ten minutes later start it again
[13:24] <Speljohan_> despite there being very few worthy of ones attention
[13:24] <vurtual> and again and again and again
[13:24] <vurtual> I've got most of the hard areas memorized.
[13:24] * IDTL (IceChat7@adsl-75-15-241-183.dsl.bkfd14.sbcglobal.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[13:24] <vurtual> also it was one of the games that stayed being hard
[13:24] <Speljohan_> get sick of shooting after 10 minutes
[13:24] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:25] <Speljohan_> i*
[13:25] <vurtual> hard mode aws just extra challenge thrown ontop for you, but the game was always hard.
[13:25] <vurtual> Sometimes the enemies had perfect traps set up.
[13:25] <vurtual> I'm looking at you, on a rail.
[13:25] <Speljohan_> yeh, sucks that games aren't hard anymore
[13:25] <Speljohan_> damn casuals
[13:25] <Speljohan_> ruining the market
[13:25] <vurtual> no supplies, 180 degree turn into a bunker gun and fortified soldiers in hiding!?
[13:25] <vurtual> That place was mindboggling
[13:25] <Speljohan_> oh i loved return to castle wolfenstein
[13:25] <vurtual> also half-life had awesome AI
[13:26] <Roadcrosser> GAAH
[13:26] <Roadcrosser> HEADACHE
[13:26] <Speljohan_> take some cocaine
[13:27] <vurtual> no, weed.
[13:27] <vurtual> weed is good for you man.
[13:27] <Speljohan_> or a combo
[13:27] <vurtual> everything
[13:27] <vurtual> at once
[13:27] <Speljohan_> cocaine, weed and lsd
[13:27] <Speljohan_> in a mix
[13:27] <vurtual> every last thing that can be considred a drug
[13:27] <Speljohan_> party-cake
[13:27] <vurtual> caffeine, adrenaline?, cocaine, weed, lsd, ecstacy, salvia...
[13:27] <Speljohan_> mcat
[13:27] <vurtual> does morphine count?
[13:27] <Speljohan_> mephendrome
[13:27] <vurtual> and every medicine
[13:28] <Speljohan_> steroids, don't forget the steroids!
[13:28] <vurtual> become so high you outrun light, and become first contact.
[13:28] <vurtual> for everything at once
[13:28] <vurtual> because you're going warp 10, maaaan.
[13:28] <Speljohan_> first contact with the vulcans
[13:28] <Speljohan_> a human on lsd
[13:28] <vurtual> Honestly after seeing some apparently not so great games(coughdoomthreecoughquakefourcough)
[13:28] <vurtual> half-life was like
[13:28] <Speljohan_> ye they both sucked
[13:29] <Speljohan_> i did like the horror theme of doom3 though
[13:29] <Speljohan_> but i disliked the environment
[13:29] <Roadcrosser> guys at TNG they exceeded warp 10 and only made it past 2 galaxies
[13:29] <vurtual> "Woah we're the ye olde shootery fun of quake and storytelling of quake 2 in a mdoern and amazingly realistic, actiony, fun, and perfected system with amazingly perfected graphics, storytelling, and characters!"
[13:29] <Speljohan_> voyager reached warp 10
[13:29] <vurtual> no
[13:29] <Speljohan_> and traveled through every point in the unvierse
[13:29] <Speljohan_> but
[13:29] <vurtual> a tiny shuttle from the voyager
[13:29] <Speljohan_> ye
[13:29] <vurtual> went to warp 10
[13:29] <Speljohan_> sorry
[13:29] <Speljohan_> ye
[13:29] <vurtual> then they started evolving backwards
[13:29] <Roadcrosser> oh
[13:29] <vurtual> and had kids.
[13:29] <Speljohan_> and mr tom paris didnt feel vry good
[13:29] <vurtual> or was it forwards?
[13:29] <vurtual> yeah, forwards
[13:29] <Speljohan_> forward
[13:29] <Speljohan_> he was aging
[13:29] <vurtual> and had kids
[13:29] <Roadcrosser> I thought it was the delta flyer
[13:29] <Speljohan_> nah
[13:30] <Roadcrosser> what
[13:30] <vurtual> with the captain
[13:30] <vurtual> yeah delta flyer
[13:30] <Speljohan_> delta flyer came later on
[13:30] <Roadcrosser> what
[13:30] <Roadcrosser> what
[13:30] <Roadcrosser> what
[13:30] <vurtual> he took the captain with him at warp 10
[13:30] <Roadcrosser> darnit
[13:30] <Roadcrosser> I took paracetimo;
[13:30] <Speljohan_> delta flyer wasn't made when he hit warp 10
[13:30] <vurtual> then they turned into amphibians and mated.
[13:30] <Roadcrosser> l
[13:30] <vurtual> the old super-shuttle ok
[13:30] <Roadcrosser> whatever its called
[13:30] <vurtual> anyawys yeah
[13:30] <Speljohan_> i want me sum transwarp-coils
[13:30] <vurtual> You should go get all the half-life games, starting with half-life, half-life 2, half-life 2 episode one(BEAR WITH IT), and half-life 2 episode two
[13:30] <vurtual> and just all play them, Speljohan_.
[13:30] <Speljohan_> nothx
[13:31] <Speljohan_> i tried half life 2
[13:31] <Speljohan_> played like 4 maps
[13:31] <Speljohan_> then i got bored
[13:31] <vurtual> the canals are the hard part ok
[13:31] <Speljohan_> i dont care about difficulty, i cannot enjoy fps's
[13:31] <vurtual> the airboat is pretty cool and ravenholm was awesome
[13:31] <Speljohan_> they bore me too quickly
[13:31] <vurtual> ...
[13:31] <vurtual> Are you even human?
[13:31] <vurtual> You vulcan eh
[13:31] <Speljohan_> u bet i am
[13:31] <vurtual> just playing strategy games all day
[13:31] <vurtual> having no fun or action
[13:31] <Speljohan_> rts's and good rpg's
[13:31] <Speljohan_> like baldur's gate
[13:31] <vurtual> you probably just guessed about quake being a classic!
[13:32] <Speljohan_> 'sif
[13:32] <vurtual> It could be some game from 2010 and you WOULD NOT EVEN KNOW
[13:32] <Speljohan_> it was my first pc game
[13:32] <Speljohan_> and since it was my first pc game it obviously stuck to me
[13:32] <vurtual> Tiiime to choooooose NO WAIT YOU DON'T GET THAAAAT
[13:34] <vurtual> you never fought a strider, or did a hardcore standoff against armies of antlions
[13:34] <Subhazard> FUCK YEAH
[13:34] <Speljohan_> nop
[13:34] <Subhazard> DIAMOND ARMOR
[13:34] <Speljohan_> and it does not interest me!
[13:34] <Subhazard> FUCK YEAH
[13:34] <Subhazard> DIAMOND ARMOR
[13:34] <Subhazard> FUCK YEAH

[13:37] <vurtual> sir I'm sorry but
[13:37] <vurtual> hdr
[13:37] <vurtual> You msut hate hdr and innovative design and stuff
[13:37] <Speljohan_> hdr is cool
[13:37] <Speljohan_> i enjoy modern graphics
[13:37] <vurtual> half-life coming out pretty much took any attempt to make a story-driven game and put that to shame ten times, put any attempt to fathom it to shame four times, then ascended real life.
[13:37] <Speljohan_> but i do not enjoy modern games
[13:38] <Speljohan_> xcept baldur's gate beat half-life ttly in story
[13:38] <vurtual> the only people I've ever been unable to like hl2 were one guy who hated everything, and insisted that the combine were explained in hl1.
[13:38] <vurtual> half-life was the first good game where you were a person.
[13:38] <vurtual> At first, you were a guy going to work, just doing a job.
[13:39] <vurtual> Then BOOM, something goes insanely wrong, and you have to fight for your life, and there's an actual story and setting and reason for everything.
[13:39] <Speljohan_> needless to say, not everyone share your opinion :P
[13:39] <vurtual> millions do.
[13:39] <Speljohan_> same can be said about wow
[13:40] <Speljohan_> difference being, wow is a shit game, hl is not
[13:40] <Speljohan_> i just dont like it
[13:40] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:40] <vurtual> It won 50 game of the year awards
[13:40] <vurtual> how can you not like it
[13:40] <vurtual> You liked quake, you can't play off the "can't shoot" card.
[13:40] <Speljohan_> why would i change my views based off other people's opinions?
[13:40] <Speljohan_> that's just stupid
[13:40] <vurtual> because we insist you to retry
[13:40] <Speljohan_> i gave it a fair chance
[13:40] <Speljohan_> i didn't like it
[13:40] <vurtual> also because I have mind pooowers
[13:40] <Speljohan_> and ps i can use "can't shoot" card
[13:41] <Speljohan_> because quake1 was my first game
[13:41] <Speljohan_> first game always invokes nostalgia
[13:41] <vurtual> You'd not bea ble to get past the second level of the first chapter of quake without enough aim to run around and hit a target repeatedly.
[13:41] <Speljohan_> doesn't matter how bad it is
[13:41] <vurtual> unless you just fondly remember the first level.
[13:41] <vurtual> then quit at the slipgate and was like "WELP I CAN'T PLAY PAST THIS, CAN'T AIM DURR"
[13:41] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:42] <vurtual> Normally I can comprehend someone's opinion for not liking a game but dude.
[13:42] <vurtual> You liked quake, you like stories, you like older games.
[13:43] <Speljohan_> like i said, i liked quake because IT WAS MY FIRST GAME
[13:43] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:43] <vurtual> that's not a very smart excuse
[13:43] <vurtual> can you just go back and enjoy it now?
[13:43] <Speljohan_> yes
[13:44] <Speljohan_> because of all fond memories from my childhood
[13:44] <vurtual> that can't make you enjoy things now.
[13:44] <Speljohan_> had it not been for them, it wouldn't entertain me
[13:44] <vurtual> I tried that once for a few games.
[13:44] <vurtual> It didn't work.
[13:44] <Speljohan_> works well for me
[13:44] <Speljohan_> and millions of other
[13:44] <Speljohan_> :P
[13:44] <vurtual> ok have fond memories of quake while playing half-life
[13:44] <vurtual> nostalgia about the 5 reused sounds and textures
[13:44] <Speljohan_> take a closer look into the mmorpg population
[13:44] <vurtual> There's like, a computer beep!
[13:44] <Speljohan_> they share the same sentiments as me
[13:44] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:44] <vurtual> And a wall!
[13:45] <vurtual> ok one second you're hating starcraft for being too korean-micromanagey then try using the mmo population as an argument for why you like... quake?
[13:45] <vurtual> Either I'm too tired or that's a paradox.
[13:45] <Speljohan_> i'm just saying, your first game is always special
[13:46] <Speljohan_> it's especially visible in the mmo crowd
[13:46] <Speljohan_> eg everyone hates on everything
[13:46] <Speljohan_> except their first game
[13:46] <Speljohan_> lol
[13:48] <vurtual> Actually.
[13:48] <vurtual> You're the only person I've ever met, ever, who didn't like the first half-life, except maybe this one other guy.
[13:48] <vurtual> And that guy would troll everyone in his little 15 year old comfort-land basement
[13:48] <Speljohan_> mk
[13:48] <Speljohan_> good for you!
[13:49] <vurtual> and then insult everything, then cmoe asking me what half of those things were, then insult me and try to keep talking to me.
[13:49] <Speljohan_> i do not insult everything though

[15:25] <chibifs> <MarkofBear> : A rhythm game for psp using the Vocaloid music.
[15:25] <MarkofBear> aaah ok
[15:25] <MarkofBear> long time since i played on the psp
[15:26] <chibifs> I figured it out, it's not integrated into the game, it just puts new music on your psp and uses the game's custom track files. :(
[15:26] <chibifs> I was hoping for new songs to play that actually progress the game. It gets boring to play the same 30 or so over and over again to unlock stuff
[15:27] <chibifs> So I guess I'll just wait for the second one. Or maybe buy the ps3 version xD

[17:54] <gear1> i just picked it up yesterday
[17:54] <Quatroking> I got tired of the constant crashing so I wiped it off my drive
[17:54] <Vicrry> lolz Quat
[17:55] <gear1> i feel like im in an action movie
[17:55] <Vicrry> I was thinking of picking up for PS3
[17:55] <MarkofBear> i got bored of the game
[17:55] <gear1> i havent crashed yet, im lucky i guess
[17:55] <MarkofBear> its was so repetive
[17:55] <Vicrry> But then I looked in my checkbook
[17:55] <MarkofBear> it felt like "mercenaries 3"
[17:55] <MarkofBear> but worse
[17:55] <Quatroking> Its a good game, its just that the engine performs shittier than Fallout 3
[17:55] <Quatroking> and thats really bad.
[17:56] <gear1> how often would you crash?
[17:56] <MarkofBear> totally unplayable with a 360 controller
[17:56] <gear1> the voice acting and script
[17:56] <gear1> is tragic
[17:56] <Vicrry> Is it really like Airstrikes 3? Complete with nuclear strikes you call in with a smoke grenade? :P
[17:56] <gear1> but i think it adds to the action packed b-movie feel
[17:57] <MarkofBear> thats like mercenaries x3
[17:57] <Quatroking> gear1, it currently crashes when picking up crates and finishing missions
[17:57] <gear1> oh, i dont get that

[19:26] <Vicrry> yep!
[19:26] <Demki> I am thinking why my triangles program doesn't work.
[19:27] <Demki> supposed to calculate the sides and angle of a triangle given the coords
[19:27] <Demki> the sides it does well
[19:27] <Demki> but the angles....

[19:32] <Demki> it isn't a right angle triangle

[19:33] <Demki> I will show you the code I use atm

[19:34] <Malikat> you have to drop a line down to make it two right triangles

[19:36] <Malikat> so pick a line, take the perpendicular slope, find where a line with the new slope would intersect with both the opposite corner and the original line
[19:36] <Malikat> then you have two right triangles
[19:37] <Demki> http://pastebin.com/cjYQCiDi
[19:38] <Demki> I calculate the (angle to X axis of line A) - (angle to X axis of line B)
[19:38] <Demki> if this is wrong, then this is wrong
[19:38] <Malikat> sounds good
[19:38] <Demki> problem is
[19:39] <bildramer> uh what
[19:39] <Demki> the output text:

[19:39] <Demki> uh... wait
[19:39] <bildramer> you'll need to use the cosine stuff thingy

[19:39] <Malikat> that can't be right
[19:39] <bildramer> a * a = b * b + c * c - 2 * b * c * cos(aplha)
[19:39] <Demki> and those angles can't be right
[19:39] <bildramer> lp*
[19:40] <Malikat> you've probably got um..
[19:40] <Malikat> two angles combining when they should be differencing
[19:40] <bildramer> where a = sqrt((bx-cx)^2+(by-cy)^2)
[19:40] <bildramer> it's just complicated
[19:40] <bildramer> get the side lengths first
[19:41] <Icereed> ;_; i wanna update on infdev, because spyspiders are killing me softly

[19:46] <bildramer> what did you do wrong?
[19:46] <Malikat> so when you are subtracting the two values

[21:06] <Azathoth> probably
[21:06] <rbos> Drewseph: for sure, you'd just scroll a lot
[21:06] <rbos> it would just have to load chunks dynamically

[21:06] <KodaichiZero> dude I think notch will eventually come out with a brilliant editor for minecraft
[21:06] <rbos> two words: "flood fill".
[21:06] <Drewseph> probably be pretty easy, after it loaded
[21:07] <KodaichiZero> a fully 3D omen-style editor
[21:07] <Drewseph> lol
[21:07] <rbos> I'd rather have notch work on more important stuff and leave ancillary items to independent developers

[21:10] <KodaichiZero> seeing forever... ah, the impossibility
[21:10] <Drewseph> but basically I wish I could actually see for more than around 256m
[21:10] <Azathoth> that would put quite a strain on your computer
[21:10] <KodaichiZero> lol it would be kind of cool if there was a pseudo-generator
[21:10] <Drewseph> why though
[21:10] <KodaichiZero> that made even blockier hills in the distance

[21:12] <MPeti> woah
[21:12] <MPeti> well, I'm not checking that number often :D
[21:12] <Azathoth> it would increase at a nonlinear rate with distance
[21:12] <MPeti> * grumps at stupid smiley *
[21:13] <Drewseph> well here is a thought
[21:13] <Drewseph> what if a secondary aplication ran in the bg and took a snapshot of the landscape form your POV
[21:13] <Azathoth> also the chunk loading is already a major bottleneck
[21:13] <Drewseph> and then placed a rtexture on the horizon to resemble what is off in the far?
[21:13] <Malikat> it would increase at an exponential rate
[21:14] <Azathoth> yes
[21:14] <Malikat> what like an asynchronous thread that creates a skywall?
[21:14] <Azathoth> it would still have to render it?
[21:14] <Drewseph> fuck >_>
[21:15] <Azathoth> regardless, the chunk loading is a major problem
[21:15] <Malikat> yeah, it would be a lot
[21:15] <Drewseph> is there a better way to do it than chunk loading?

[21:16] <Drewseph> I do hope that the game gets faster
[21:17] <Azathoth> the generating seems like a pretty CPU intensive process already
[21:17] <Drewseph> I wonder why the generating can't just happen all at once in the beginning
[21:17] <Azathoth> lol
[21:17] <Azathoth> because the map is so massive
[21:18] <Drewseph> like, have it generate the first 1kmx1km
[21:18] <Azathoth> i suppose it could, but once you left those bounds, it would be the same problem
[21:18] <Malikat> drew
[21:18] <Malikat> divide your boundary by 16 to get chunks
[21:19] <Malikat> square that number
[21:19] <Drewseph> whats boundry?
[21:19] <Malikat> divide by 1000 to get seconds
[21:19] <Malikat> 1000 x 1000 blocks
[21:19] <Malikat> we bring it to 1008^2 because that's even chunks
[21:19] <Malikat> 63^2

[21:21] <Drewseph> and play a 10km x10km map
[21:21] <Drewseph> =P
[21:21] <Drewseph> I know it snot that easy
[21:21] <Azathoth> snot!
[21:21] <Drewseph> but fuck this game is great, just needs to be a tad faster
[21:21] <Malikat> so you're looking at 130mb just to hold the map in memory

[21:22] <Malikat> 10km x 10km would take an HOUR
[21:22] <Azathoth> you would take an hour
[21:22] <Malikat> that's what exponential growth means
[21:22] <Malikat> it takes 1 ms to generate a chunk
[21:23] <Malikat> a 2x2 chunk area isn't two chunks
[21:23] <Malikat> it's 4
[21:23] <Malikat> a 10x10 is 100

[23:31] <Vicrry> Indev is done, as far as I know. Infdev will be updated and then indev will be discontinued at some time
[23:31] <Quatroking> in which I can dump ham
[23:31] <TerraSleet> i made one of those
[23:31] <Quatroking> infdev = indev
[23:31] <Quatroking> pretty much
[23:31] <TerraSleet> dug a pit all the way to the bottom of the map where i dump items

[23:32] <TerraSleet> infdev = indev with infinite map and bugfixes
