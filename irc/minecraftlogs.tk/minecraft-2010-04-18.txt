[5:30] * FNugget_ is now known as FNugget
[5:30] * Phone is now known as AndrewPH
[5:30] <C418> this bot annoys me
[5:31] * Bear_ is now known as MarkofBear
[5:31] <MarkofBear> lets kill it
[5:31] <AndrewPH> C418, blame esper for dying last night
[5:31] <slowriot> what did he want
[5:31] <slowriot> also, esper is SUCH a pile of shit
[5:31] <slowriot> why are we on this arse of a network at all?
[5:31] <C418> no I blame the bot
[5:32] <AndrewPH> C418, That's your problem
[5:32] <slowriot> i've said this before, mind, and been attacked by a bunch of self-righteous dickheads threatening to "report me to an oper", oh gnoes
[5:32] <slowriot> but ultimately, it's just shit, which that is a testament to
[5:32] <C418> oh, i can make it my problem by simply banning it
[5:32] <slowriot> a good network doesn't need crappy bullyboys to tell us all to love it
[5:32] <MarkofBear> the mans got a point
[5:32] <AndrewPH> C418, if you find it annoying when it notices you once when you join or when it joins, I think you have a problem
[5:32] <AndrewPH> It's been allowed by animator
[5:32] * FNugget_ (sex@70.143.33.86) has joined #minecraft
[5:32] <AndrewPH> take it up with him if you have a problem with the bot
[5:32] <C418> I don't think I need to
[5:33] * FNugget (sex@70.143.33.86) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[5:33] <Kokopure> oh howdy, C418!
[5:33] <slowriot> it's not bots that are a problem, it's the shitty network that can't stay solid long enough to allow us all (including bots) to remain connected
[5:33] <AndrewPH> slowriot, what the hell are you talking about
[5:33] <AndrewPH> The server bananabot was on last night died
[5:33] <AndrewPH> and it didn't let him reconnect
[5:33] <slowriot> that's my point
[5:34] * Annihilator (Annihilato@bas2-toronto48-1279398996.dsl.bell.ca) has joined #minecraft
[5:34] <slowriot> as you may or may not have seen :)
[5:34] <Kokopure> what's the problem with Bananabot?
[5:34] * CruelNoise (cruelnoise@64-7-156-113.border8-dynamic.dsl.sentex.ca) has joined #minecraft
[5:34] <C418> why do we even need a bot that only logs shit
[5:34] <CruelNoise> mornin'
[5:34] <C418> thats more horrible than useful
[5:34] <AndrewPH> C418, how so?
[5:34] <MarkofBear> wow someone hates bots
[5:34] * Subhazard|wallflower (ethcart@c-76-104-193-138.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[5:34] <slowriot> logs are alright
[5:34] <CruelNoise> becase some people don't have logs on their own computers
[5:34] <MarkofBear> yah
[5:34] <slowriot> if you think you have some sort of privacy on irc, you're barking up the wrong tree anyway
[5:35] <C418> thats just lazy
[5:35] <slowriot> at least half of us log everything anyway
[5:35] <AndrewPH> C418, just ignore the bot if you don't like it noticing you
[5:35] <slowriot> a good portion of those publish their logs
[5:35] <CruelNoise> what if you're forced to go on someone else's computer, and don't feel like leaving log files
[5:35] <slowriot> although i personally am not into that, it's something i accept is going to happen with everything i say
[5:35] * FNugget_ (sex@70.143.33.86) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[5:36] <C418> I have yet to see a useful bot in here. and since there are a SHITLOAD of experiment happy people in here
[5:36] <C418> that will take a few years

[5:52] <MarkofBear> yay!
[5:52] <MarkofBear> finally!
[5:53] <Animator> I'm going to slap ShadowDusk.

[6:03] <Keiya> I very nearly have two large chests full of meat
[6:03] * Varriount_ is now known as Varriount
[6:03] <Keiya> And ONLY meat.
[6:03] <Keiya> My generic-stuff chest isn't even half full
[6:03] <Malikat> MEAT
[6:04] <Malikat> turn off peaceful
[6:04] * Yourself (yourself@c-98-228-139-130.hsd1.il.comcast.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[6:06] <Keiya> Huh,
[6:06] <Keiya> It uses the old tree algo for ones grown in-play
[6:07] <Malikat> yep.
[6:07] <Malikat> because he hasn't redone the "is this clear?" check algorithms yet i would guess
[6:07] <Malikat> and the television series Dexter makes me feel like serial killing isn't that evil
[6:08] <Malikat> which is probably bad.
[6:08] <Keiya> Is respawning implemented yet?
[6:08] <Malikat> in infdev?
[6:08] <Malikat> like, if you die?
[6:08] <Malikat> duh?
[6:08] <Vicrry> Yep
[6:08] <Vicrry> Ask Mali, he's died once or twice :P
[6:08] * Dandistine (biocon8600@Bbergerhouserouter.st.bradley.edu) has joined #minecraft
[6:08] <Malikat> once or twice.
[6:09] <Malikat> i made a sex pit with my dead bodies
[6:09] <ClassiestMedic> I've died maybe twice
[6:09] <Malikat> jumped to death in the same 2x2 pit like 20+ times
[6:09] <ClassiestMedic> Lolwut
[6:09] <ClassiestMedic> dead bodies?
[6:09] <ClassiestMedic> is this in infdev?
[6:09] <Malikat> yeah
[6:09] <ClassiestMedic> Nice
[6:09] <ClassiestMedic> I'll do the same i think :D
[6:10] <Malikat> dead bodies act like entities
[6:10] <Malikat> so they shove you and you shove them
[6:10] <Malikat> eventually you push them all into the corners
[6:10] <Malikat> and turn into a pinball
[6:10] <Malikat> and go flying like mad around in that small area
[6:10] <Keiya> Don't they fade eventually? >_>
[6:11] <Malikat> no.
[6:11] <Malikat> they might not still exist in the more recent versions
[6:11] <Malikat> idk.
[6:12] <mail2345> i wonder how good of a gift
[6:13] <mail2345> is a pirated copy of a future twilight move is
[6:13] * DimJim (chatzilla@cpe-24-242-36-94.hot.res.rr.com) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[6:13] * Alex_ (chatzilla@123-243-220-101.tpgi.com.au) has joined #minecraft
[6:13] <mail2345> for a girl of course
[6:13] <Keiya> Horrible
[6:13] <Alex_> Hello?
[6:13] <Keiya> It's Twilight.
[6:13] <Malikat> edit it
[6:13] <Malikat> to degrade her for watching it
[6:14] <Alex_> Does anyone know how to allocate more ram to minecraft?
[6:14] <Malikat> midway
[6:14] <Alex_> No?
[6:14] <Varriount> Increase your pagefile
[6:14] <Kokopure> I sure do not, Alex
[6:14] <Malikat> why do you ask?
[6:14] <LG_Legacy> Alex
[6:14] <mail2345> @keiya
[6:14] <mail2345> actually
[6:14] <Alex_> I hate using 256, I want to use about 6gb
[6:14] <Varriount> Make sure that uneeded processes are gone
[6:14] <mail2345> there is a good spin on it
[6:15] <LG_Legacy> A. Client B. Java CP
[6:15] <mail2345> the whole
[6:15] <LG_Legacy> Thats two ways
[6:15] <Malikat> alex are you aware that it doesn't NEED 6 mb
[6:15] <Malikat> er 6gb
[6:15] <mail2345> "accept me for who i am"
[6:15] <mail2345> party
[6:15] <mail2345> part*
[6:15] <Varriount> And look on the java console for memory
[6:15] <mail2345> the reverse is
[6:15] <Alex_> Ummm can't see anything
[6:15] <mail2345> a cynical response
[6:15] <Malikat> more memory can improve a system's performance because it doesn't need to swap as much
[6:15] * mail2345 ponders
[6:16] <Keiya> mail2345: I thought it was ZOMG CUTE GUY I WANT HIM TO GET ME PREGNANT
[6:16] <Alex_> How to I increase the page file?
[6:16] <Malikat> but if a task won't use more memory, it's because it doesn't NEED more
[6:16] <Malikat> Alex_ you don't need to
[6:16] <Malikat> if you've got 6gb you're fine
[6:16] <Varriount> http://support.adobe.com/devsup/devsup.nsf/docs/52634.htm
[6:16] * MarkofBear (chatzilla@213-66-202-160-no30.tbcn.telia.com) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[6:16] <Alex_> It only lets me use 249mb'
[6:16] <Varriount> This is what the server does I believe
[6:16] <Alex_> 's*
[6:16] <mail2345> the cynical response is
[6:16] <Malikat> if it's running slow, you need to increase the processor priority for java
[6:16] <Keiya> As far as I can tell, that's about 90% of the series >_>
[6:16] <mail2345> "this didn't cost him anything"
[6:16] <mail2345> so
[6:16] <Alex_> It literally limits me to 249 which I take up in infdev
[6:16] <Malikat> 249 is the maximum for java - it doesn't need more than that
[6:16] <mail2345> what's more likly
[6:17] <Malikat> yes, everyone is limited to 249mb
[6:17] <Alex_> I have seen people allocate more
[6:17] <Alex_> Such as 4gb's
[6:17] <Malikat> except that you were probably mistaken
[6:17] <Alex_> I want to use about 6-8gb's :(
[6:17] <Malikat> look in your task manager, it's probably taking 800mb anyway
[6:17] <Malikat> Alex_ programs can't just use more memory to be faster
[6:17] * DimJim (chatzilla@cpe-24-242-36-94.hot.res.rr.com) has joined #minecraft
[6:17] <Malikat> memory is not a cure-all
[6:18] <Malikat> memory is a resource that a program needs a specific amount of
[6:18] <Malikat> if you have 6-8gb of memory, minecraft is certainly getting all it can use
[6:18] * Undead (4o4hyrq2@static-173-53-194-171.chi01.dsl-w.verizon.net) has joined #minecraft
[6:18] <Alex_> Hmmph
[6:18] <Kokopure> Malikat, don't ruin the poor man's dreams~
[6:18] <Alex_> Why do I lagg so much then
[6:18] <Malikat> because the game isn't optimized
[6:18] <Kokopure> yeah, everyone's is a bit laggy.
[6:18] <Alex_> I got I7 extreme gaming processor, so I presumed it was ram related.
[6:18] <Malikat> people in certain IRC channels bitch at notch every time he's on
[6:19] <Malikat> being like UPDATE SOON SOONER NOW
[6:19] <Kokopure> or sooner than now, if possible
[6:19] <Malikat> so he hasn't had a chance to track down the areas that are running more slowly than he'd like
[6:19] <Alex_> Ahhhh
[6:19] * Yourself (yourself@c-98-228-139-130.hsd1.il.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[6:19] <Alex_> So I have nothing to worry about?
[6:19] <Malikat> nothing at all
[6:19] <Malikat> if you have an i7 and 8gb memory
[6:19] <Malikat> there's not much you CAN do.
[6:19] <Keiya> Skeletons skeletons more skeletons aaaaeeiiiii
[6:19] <Alex_> Okay, so I will just play :D.
[6:19] <Malikat> except set the priority of the task higher
[6:20] <Undead> I even have a quad core and 4GBs of ram, and it runs fine
[6:20] <Malikat> since minecraft is mostly processor
[6:20] * chrit1b (chris@ppp118-208-20-222.lns20.bne1.internode.on.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[6:20] <Malikat> do you know how to change the priority of a task?
[6:20] <Alex_> I7 is quadcore undead :P
[6:20] <Alex_> Yeah I do
[6:20] * Undead is now known as Undead_Zeratul
[6:20] <Malikat> there you og.
[6:20] <Malikat> go*
[6:20] <Keiya> I can't turn up the rendering to the point I can see the stars without it going horribly laggy >_>
[6:20] <Undead_Zeratul> i thought I7 was a quad quad core or something
[6:21] <Undead_Zeratul> cause i have core 2 quad
[6:21] <Varriount> More than quad
[6:21] <Varriount> Six core I believe
[6:21] <Alex_> It's 8 multithreads
[6:21] * cryzed (cryzed@i59F5FC6A.versanet.de) Quit (Ping timeout: 180 seconds)
[6:21] <Undead_Zeratul> that's i5
[6:21] <Varriount> Because I have one!
[6:21] <PuyoDead> It's quad.
[6:21] <Keiya> I have not seen a single creeper or zombie
[6:21] <Undead_Zeratul> turn off peaceful
[6:21] <Keiya> but lots of skeles. lots of them
[6:21] <Malikat> your setting is peaceful
[6:21] <PuyoDead> Although, Win7's little monitor likes to say I have 8 cores.
[6:22] <Malikat> oh
[6:22] <Keiya> Malikat: No it's not.
[6:22] <Keiya> I mean that it's only spawning skeletons
[6:22] <Undead_Zeratul> hmmm
[6:22] <Malikat> the game wants you to die
[6:22] <Undead_Zeratul> hooray
[6:22] <Alex_> i7-980X 6 cores 12 threads 3.33 GHz
[6:23] <Undead_Zeratul> just out of curiosity, is Notch making infinite maps the only option in the future for map sizes? or is he making it an aditional size option?
[6:23] <Alex_> Anyway, to infdev :D
[6:23] <Malikat> it is a size option
[6:23] <Undead_Zeratul> awesome
[6:23] <Undead_Zeratul> cuase it's easy to lose your place in infinite maps
[6:23] <Malikat> or at least, notch has said you will be able to use non-infinite
[6:23] <Malikat> zeratul: i find keeping track of north to help a lot
[6:23] <Malikat> and building massive landmarks
[6:24] <Undead_Zeratul> that's true.. either way, i'm going to play more heavily once caves work again
[6:24] <Undead_Zeratul> well, on infdev
[6:24] <Keiya> There are a couple zombies.
[6:24] <Malikat> it will be nice once caves work
[6:24] <Kokopure> indeed
[6:24] <Keiya> AS THE SUN RISES
[6:24] <Undead_Zeratul> and when mobs spawn a LOT less xD
[6:24] <Malikat> then monsters will be able to spawn underground
[6:24] <Malikat> so they won't ALL have to spawn aboveground
[6:24] <Undead_Zeratul> that's fine
[6:24] <Undead_Zeratul> ahh
[6:25] <Undead_Zeratul> is that why there's a BUNCH of them?
[6:25] <Alex_> Malikat, what do you think of this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwi3gHWViF8&feature=channel
[6:25] <Undead_Zeratul> they all spawn above ground?
[6:25] <Undead_Zeratul> i mean it makes sense, i just never thought of it that way

[6:35] <Malikat> 5 story underground farm
[6:35] <TheClassiestMedic> I might do that
[6:35] <TheClassiestMedic> that's a good idea
[6:35] <Splatticus> I think stone might be a better idea.
[6:35] <TheClassiestMedic> Imma do that

[6:36] <Vicrry> My problem isn't so much the size of greenhouse or growing it, it's just that whenever I get within a 1/4 mile of the place a small army of pigs spawns in it and immediately tramples everything
[6:36] <Undead_Zeratul> xD
[6:36] <Undead_Zeratul> i keep getting pigs in me caves
[6:36] <Splatticus> But planting trees ontop of the Catamaran during production = Huge mess of leaves since they don't fall.
[6:36] <Tennist0> im getting sheep everywhere
[6:36] <Splatticus> If I core out the trunk and plant it at that spot will the trunk regrow and reuse the leaves?
[6:36] <Tennist0> well, inside my buildings and mines
[6:37] <Splatticus> Tennist, mail me their wool. ]:
[6:37] <Malikat> idk splat
[6:37] <Malikat> maybe
[6:37] <Tennist0> outside is like pig and creeper fest
[6:37] <Splatticus> I need a ton of it for the Dirigible balloons.
[6:37] <Undead_Zeratul> the leaves fall... unless you're talking about infdev

[6:37] <TheClassiestMedic> upload the underground wheat field
[6:37] <Splatticus> Trim it away from the wood and light it, and stand around prepared to pat out the fires.
[6:37] <CruelNoise> splat, how are you going to attempt that?
[6:37] <Vicrry> Splat - leaves will disappear when the trunk is gone

[6:39] <Undead_Zeratul> that's why i save em
[6:39] <Undead_Zeratul> :>
[6:39] <Splatticus> Idk, Mali.
[6:39] <Splatticus> It's also going to be irritating clearing away the land underneath them.
[6:39] <CruelNoise> are you two having, like, a secret conversation that is somehow leaking into #minecraft?
[6:39] <Splatticus> I need to build like... Single block towers and figure something out that would be easy to clear away once they're done.
[6:40] <Splatticus> We're talking about my Floating Catamaran Idea, that will be impressive because I'm doing it legit.
[6:40] <Undead_Zeratul> is gold armor worth it? or are they as weak as gold tools?
[6:40] <CruelNoise> but half of your conversation appears to be here, half of it elsewhere
[6:40] <Splatticus> No it's not.
[6:40] <Vicrry> I wonder how long it'll be before indev maps can be transferred to infdev, and when it'll be worth it
[6:40] <Vicrry> As far as I know, gold is fragging useless except for showing off
[6:40] <Splatticus> Half of it is now, and half of it is from later.

[7:39] <PixelEater> Undead_Zeratul: Inf or In?
[7:39] <Undead_Zeratul> indev
[7:39] <PixelEater> finally! someone who understands!
[7:39] <PixelEater> :)
[7:39] <PixelEater> i hate infdev
[7:39] <PixelEater> its just too big
[7:39] <Undead_Zeratul> i don't mind it... i just get lost xD
[7:40] <PixelEater> same
[7:40] <PixelEater> and
[7:40] <PixelEater> its more fun when you are limited
[7:40] <Undead_Zeratul> i'd play it more if caves worked
[7:40] <PixelEater> then you are forced to explore more
[7:40] <PixelEater> like
[7:40] <PixelEater> explore what you have
[7:40] <Undead_Zeratul> true
[7:40] <PixelEater> more interesting that way
[7:40] <PixelEater> brb
[7:41] <PixelEater> back
[7:41] <Undead_Zeratul> i mean, i'm all for the unlimited maps, but i feel like if i try and go somewhere, i'll just lose my starting aread unless i make an epic spire that just seems too intensive with what little reasources i can muster without any caves to help me... i'm not for making my own tunnels really... i just want to find my own veins in an actual cave
[7:41] <PixelEater> yeah, same.
[7:41] <PixelEater> but if i have to make a tunnel
[7:41] <Undead_Zeratul> brb dog at door
[7:41] <PixelEater> damn right i will :)
[7:41] <Undead_Zeratul> well yeah, if you have to
[7:42] <Undead_Zeratul> but i love breaking open into a giant underground river or w/e
[7:42] <Undead_Zeratul> and exploring it
[7:42] <PixelEater> Undead_Zeratul, what are your favorite settings on indev map generation? i personally like the default, but sometimes i get bored of the night time and set it to paradise theme
[7:42] <Dommys> I also long for Generated Cave systems.. But I love infdev.. especially for getting Lost
[7:43] <Dommys> Maybe notch could add "Paradise" difficulty mode to infdev.. and keep it light and bright for you night fear folks.
[7:44] <Admiral|Splatticus> Are Macs and Linux different things?
[7:44] <Keiya> Why are there so many animals on my road?
[7:44] <PixelEater> Admiral|Splatticus: in a sense
[7:44] <Dommys> Sorta.
[7:44] <PixelEater> Mac = Darwin = Unix
[7:44] <Keiya> Admiral|Splatticus: Are hotdogs and sausages different things?
[7:44] <PixelEater> Linux = Unix
[7:44] <Dommys> Sorta.
[7:44] <PixelEater> so in its roots, sure
[7:44] <PixelEater> i like the night time on indev, but sometimes i feel like i dont have enough daytime
[7:44] <Admiral|Splatticus> I would like Paradise, as long as mobs still spawned in darkness.
[7:44] <PixelEater> Admiral|Splatticus: they do.
[7:45] <Dommys> Do they?

[7:45] <PixelEater> yep.
[7:45] <Admiral|Splatticus> I meant in response to Dommys recommendation.
[7:45] <Dommys> I thought Paradise was all safe all the time.
[7:45] <PixelEater> i generated a map
[7:45] <PixelEater> walked into a cave
[7:45] <PixelEater> got mauled by a zombie
[7:45] <PixelEater> died.
[7:45] <Undead_Zeratul> i hate getting lost, so i try to stay away from infdev for that, but i like playing on it because of HOW it generates maps... as for my preferred settings Pixel, I choose huge square/deep, island/floating, and normal
[7:45] <Dommys> Paradise map, with Modified difficulty maybe?

[7:46] <UncleBibby> maybe one would be a skull, and one would be a pig
[7:46] <Undead_Zeratul> can't you just change that in the image files?
[7:46] <Superwafflez> would be cool fi you could upload your own
[7:46] <Superwafflez> if*
[7:46] <Superwafflez> for multiplayer
[7:46] <Undead_Zeratul> if it's not hard coded, i'm thinking it wouldn't be too hard
[7:46] <PixelEater> hmm
[7:46] <PixelEater> you are right.
[7:47] <UncleBibby> I don't want to mess with notch's plans, ya know?
[7:47] <Undead_Zeratul> wow... i've got enough iron... 5x64 ingots
[7:47] <vurtual> Guys if you are getting lost in infdev
[7:47] <UncleBibby> I wanna play it HIS way

[7:48] <vurtual> Lots of minecraft's paintings are low res counter-strike shots

[7:54] <KodaichiZero> sorry kiddies, uncle Koda's a bit rude

[7:55] <vurtual> hold W to move forward and lean forward, into a straight dive
[7:55] <vurtual> S levels you out
[7:55] <UncleBibby> thats okay uncle koda, just tell us about when graphics were supposed to be realistic again
[7:55] <TheClassiestMedic> is it possible to dye cloth in indev?
[7:55] <KodaichiZero> haha, okay, so it all started with a guy called Dock...
[7:55] <KodaichiZero> no
[7:55] <Keiya> vurtual: Eh, they can't really claim they invented it.
[7:55] <KodaichiZero> its not possible
[7:55] <KodaichiZero> it will be
[7:55] <vurtual> Keiya it'
[7:55] <TheClassiestMedic> hrmph
[7:56] <vurtual> it's a just cause thing
[7:56] <TheClassiestMedic> k
[7:56] <vurtual> grapple-chuting is a just cause thing

[7:56] <Keiya> But the grapple thing, that's basically Link's hookshot.
[7:56] <KodaichiZero> sup wolfy
[7:56] <UncleBibby> you suck donkey tongues
[7:56] <Keiya> vurtual: Just don't let the player deploy the chute while grappleing. PROBLEM SOLVED
[7:57] <UncleBibby> I just saw sin city.
[7:57] <UncleBibby> did you all like it?
[7:57] <Keiya> Or do, since JC2 copies gameplay elements like crazy too.
[7:57] <KodaichiZero> I just saw deathstalker 1
[7:57] <Keiya> And I assume JC did too
[7:57] <KodaichiZero> it's basically a rape-fest with swords
[7:57] <Undead_Zeratul> i liked sin city
[7:57] <KodaichiZero> i'd reccommend it
[7:58] <UncleBibby> elijah wood was cast as someone very un-frodo in sin city
[7:58] <Keiya> Besides, I bet Batman's done it at least once. :P
[7:58] <vurtual> nope
[7:58] <vurtual> it's a just cause thing
[7:58] <Keiya> UncleBibby: As long as he didn't have curly hair, and wore shoes, it's OK :P
[7:58] <vurtual> anyways a zelda mod for just cause would be awesome
[7:59] <KodaichiZero> vurtual: that might tip me over and actually make me buy it
[7:59] <KodaichiZero> I mean, I'm interested and all, but Zelda? F year
[7:59] <Keiya> vurtual: And stealing cars is a GTA thing. Shooting people is an Astroids thing! Need I go on?
[7:59] <vurtual> KodaichiZero there's an mp mod
[7:59] <vurtual> Keiya, no no.
[7:59] <vurtual> it'd be like making a game
[7:59] <vurtual> where the whole point is to gather stars, platform, and go into paintings
[7:59] <vurtual> that's a mario 64 thing
[8:00] <vurtual> well mostly a mario thing
[8:00] <UncleBibby> more like a stupid poop butt thing
[8:00] <Keiya> vurtual: setting != gameplay elements
[8:00] <vurtual> or like literally making a game about dodging and shooting asteroids that break into smaller ones
[8:00] <UncleBibby> that game rocked actually
[8:00] <KodaichiZero> I wanna play game where you play with control of a hera
[8:00] <Keiya> >_>
[8:00] <KodaichiZero> hero
[8:00] <KodaichiZero> but the story is told from the perspective of his sidekick
[8:00] <Keiya> Fine then
[8:00] <Keiya> Give us Link's hookshot instead, only able to grab on anywhere.
[8:00] <UncleBibby> theres tons of rumors about a marvel vs capcom 3 game
[8:00] <KodaichiZero> i don't think it's been done
[8:00] <Keiya> Happy now? :P

[8:07] <Undead_Zeratul> yeah, i can't wait for the final product

[8:12] <vurtual_> or the mooooon

[8:12] <vurtual_> urban locations, obscure forests, ancient ruins.
[8:12] <Killing_Frenzie> i accidentily closed the window but thanks
[8:12] <UncleBibby> is that like a joke or something?
[8:12] <UncleBibby> all three of those ideas have already been rts games
[8:13] <vurtual_> what.
[8:13] <vurtual_> where
[8:13] <vurtual_> I want space marine wasps :(

[8:14] <UncleBibby> military madness was remade on wiiware recently even
[8:14] <vurtual_> no as one game
[8:14] <UncleBibby> okay ya got me there
[8:15] <UncleBibby> But I think the only way to make a game stand out nowadays is the premise, not the quality
[8:15] <vurtual_> and the sides are kinds of ants, wasps/bees, and kinds of arachhnids maybe
[8:15] <UncleBibby> ya that would be cool
[8:15] <vurtual_> and it's like starcraft-style side differences and total annihilation style gameplay partially
[8:15] <Keiya> Also, UncleBibby, 4 of the shogi pieces are identical to chess pieces, and one more is strictly a subset (the shogi knight can only move forward, not to the sides or back)

[8:15] <Keiya> Though promotion is different in shogi.
[8:16] <vurtual_> and the wasps have worker bees as swarming builders/cheap combat units(useless against tougher things), various types of wasp soldiers, hornets as later units
[8:16] <vurtual_> and then giant japanese hornets outfitted with all sorts of weapons and a massive micro-nuke railgun as experimental units.
[8:16] <UncleBibby> maybe the chess pieces would be one on one, while the shogi pieces would use tag team like capcom vs marvel

[8:17] <vurtual_> then arachnids have various strong units that take a long time to get going, so you have just a few, each very unique.

[8:17] <UncleBibby> Vurtual, would the game be retail or downloadable?
[8:17] <vurtual_> steam or freeware or I dunno
[8:17] <vurtual_> this is just an idea
[8:18] <vurtual_> then the ants are swarming and can set up defenses and fast teleports, and things like fire ants are just upgraded units that take more resources to make
[8:18] <UncleBibby> I'm glad this bug rts idea excites you as much as it excites me
[8:18] <vurtual_> while both the wasp and ant sides have super steampunk looking queen units, arachnids have no central system.
[8:18] <Kokopure> um
[8:18] <Kokopure> there's already kind of a bug RTS.
[8:18] <Kokopure> it's called Pikmin.
[8:19] <vurtual_> Kokopure that's nothing similar to this
[8:19] <Kokopure> okaaay~
[8:19] <vurtual_> pikmin isn't like starcraft and total annihilation but with bugs
[8:19] <UncleBibby> well, that game is quite unique in its gameplay, so I wouldn't call it an rts
[8:19] <Kokopure> but it is, isn't it?
[8:19] <UncleBibby> pikmin is hella sweet though
[8:19] <Kokopure> you have to make units and command them against larger foes that take coordination to take down
[8:19] <UncleBibby> pikmin is sweet in brawl, too
[8:19] <Kokopure> but you're right, it isn't like other RTS games
[8:19] <Kokopure> haha
[8:20] <Kokopure> I could never get the hang of Olimar
[8:20] <Kokopure> my friend kicks everloving ass with him, though
[8:20] <UncleBibby> I love donkey kong in that game
[8:20] <mail2345> @quatroking
[8:20] <Griskard> Trees still dont go?
[8:20] <Griskard> grow
[8:20] <UncleBibby> his f-air is godly
[8:20] <Kokopure> I'm afraid I'm a Samus fangirl
[8:20] <Kokopure> Samus got real heavy in Brawl though.
[8:20] <UncleBibby> not in the zero suit
[8:20] <Kokopure> I suppose that's okay, though, because now that she's somewhat of a heavyweight it balances against ZS
[8:20] <Kokopure> yeah
[8:20] <UncleBibby> ya
[8:20] <vurtual_> also imagine having spiders with railguns.
[8:20] <Kokopure> Samus is basically two characters now <3
[8:21] <Kokopure> sort of like Zelda/Shiek
[8:21] <Kokopure> only with MISSILES
[8:21] <Kokopure> :D
[8:21] <vurtual_> and instead of just spider silk stuff they have intelligent carbon nanotubes

[9:35] <vurtual_> wait
[9:36] <vurtual_> what if you took a pistol, but instead of making it fire like a pistol, you made it all rifle-like, and then had a weight on the back to balance it?
[9:36] <vurtual_> so you fired rifle cartridges like a pistol, and could do it one handeeed.
[9:36] <vurtual_> or two handed all properly like I guess.
[9:36] <ClassiestMedic> that'd be awesome
[9:36] <Dysgalt> What about shock?
[9:36] <Bomb_Spammer> It would be terrible
[9:36] <Bomb_Spammer> Because you'd have no barrel length
[9:36] <Bomb_Spammer> No recoil absorption
[9:36] <Dysgalt> It'd be impossible to fire a pistol like a machine gun
[9:36] <Bomb_Spammer> And a tiny magazine size
[9:37] <Dysgalt> if you made it heavy enough
[9:37] <Bomb_Spammer> Just use a rifle
[9:37] <Dysgalt> you wouldn't be able to hold it properly
[9:37] <Dysgalt> Or a smg
[9:37] <Bomb_Spammer> SMGs use pistol rounds you derp
[9:37] <Dysgalt> not a pistol though
[9:37] <Dysgalt> He was talking about a 1 handed
[9:37] <vurtual_> just lots of bullets
[9:37] <Dysgalt> full auto weapon
[9:37] <Bomb_Spammer> Hes talking about wanting rifle bullets
[9:37] <vurtual_> no, single shots.
[9:37] <vurtual_> "rifles" are mostly semi-automatic
[9:38] <Dysgalt> Semi-auto
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> Oh you mean an assault rifle?
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> Fuck I thought he just meant regular rifle
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> That was really vague
[9:38] <Dysgalt> ya..
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> Oh
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> Then yeah
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> Just use a carbine
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> Cut down rifle
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> A pistol was never meant for stoppig power range or penetration
[9:38] <Dysgalt> though the magazine
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> it's for concealability
[9:38] <Dysgalt> would be a bit odd
[9:38] <vurtual_> no no
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> Unless you use that one pistol that fires .50BMG
[9:38] <vurtual_> pistols were made so you could hold them and fire them easily
[9:38] <Bomb_Spammer> That's just ridiculous
[9:38] <Dysgalt> Still getting shot
[9:39] <Dysgalt> will stop you
[9:39] <Dysgalt> pretty much

[9:39] <Bomb_Spammer> Not really
[9:39] <Dysgalt> Due to shock
[9:39] <vurtual_> cept .22 through the side of your arm
[9:39] <Bomb_Spammer> People ahve been shot in the face with 9mm and not noticed
[9:39] <Dysgalt> Thats shock
[9:39] <vurtual_> You'll "WHAT WAS THAT" if you notice(which you will generally, not always), then start bleeding
[9:39] <vurtual_> so you put bandaids on it
[9:39] <Dysgalt> Shock can do many things
[9:39] <vurtual_> and then let it heal for a while
[9:39] <Bomb_Spammer> No that's called bad shot placement
[9:39] <Dysgalt> fuck if you get shot
[9:39] <Dysgalt> It'll have a chance
[9:39] <Dysgalt> of ripping through nerves
[9:39] <Dysgalt> arterys
[9:39] <Dysgalt> bones
[9:39] <Dysgalt> muscles
[9:39] <vurtual_> I mean, just the mild barrel-weight could be countered with a small amount of mildly heavy stuff on the other end, or do it bullpup style
[9:40] <Bomb_Spammer> You pretty much have to hit something vital or else really fuck up someone's guts to stop them with bullets
[9:40] <vurtual_> actually if it were a pistol, a bullpup wouldn't be too hard to handle
[9:40] <Dysgalt> Mm Bomb_Spammer lets test this theory
[9:40] <Bomb_Spammer> >bullpup
[9:40] <Dysgalt> I'll shoot you in the chest
[9:40] <Bomb_Spammer> >pistol
[9:40] <Dysgalt> with a .45 hollow point
[9:40] <Dysgalt> at 20 feet
[9:40] <Bomb_Spammer> >implying the chest is not full of vital things
[9:40] <vurtual_> googling: bullpup configuration pistol firing rifle rounds
[9:40] <Bomb_Spammer> Derp herp de derp
[9:40] <Dysgalt> or arm
[9:40] <Dysgalt> Ok fine arm
[9:40] <Dysgalt> If I were to hit you in the shoulder
[9:40] <vurtual_> Dysgalt that'd break bones and suuuck
[9:40] <Dysgalt> It would rupture a major artery
[9:41] <vurtual_> it'd really disable you
[9:41] <Dysgalt> if it was a low hit
[9:41] <Bomb_Spammer> >still talking about vital things
[9:41] <Dysgalt> you would be dead in
[9:41] <Bomb_Spammer> Derrrp
[9:41] <Dysgalt> say 1minute
[9:41] <Dysgalt> A shot to the elbow
[9:41] <vurtual_> then you can like aim it, fire a shot or two, while using your other hand.
[9:41] <Dysgalt> will rip your elbow apart
[9:41] <Bomb_Spammer> <Bomb_Spammer> You pretty much have to hit something vital or else really fuck up someone's guts to stop them with bullets
[9:41] <Dysgalt> never to be used again
[9:41] <Dysgalt> EVERY FUCKING PART OF YOUR BODY IS NEAR VITAL
[9:41] <Bomb_Spammer> A shot to the elbow with .45 will not rip your eelbow apart
[9:41] <Bomb_Spammer> Hollow point squishes
[9:41] <Bomb_Spammer> It deforms agaisnt flesh nevermind bone
[9:41] <Dysgalt> Dude the nerves
[9:41] <Dysgalt> arterys

[9:44] <mail2345> and cloaking device prvents people from seeing you
[9:44] <Bomb_Spammer> Unless it's fucking HUGE
[9:44] <Dysgalt> and stabbed you
[9:44] <vurtual_> Bomb_Spammer, I'm the bullet nerd
[9:44] <Bomb_Spammer> And it literally just rapes you
[9:44] <mail2345> okay
[9:44] <vurtual_> a small round going through your arm will damage muscle
[9:44] <mail2345> so i ran off
[9:44] <Dysgalt> with a .2square inch tip
[9:44] <mail2345> grabbed the device
[9:44] <vurtual_> your arm will suck
[9:44] <mail2345> but it felt easy
[9:44] <Dysgalt> thats the equivelant
[9:44] <mail2345> so i went ahead
[9:44] <Dysgalt> of being hit by a 22
[9:45] <mail2345> and decided to sabatoge the AI
[9:45] <Dysgalt> it knocks you back
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> Which in the long run /is/ shit all
[9:45] <Dysgalt> you stumble
[9:45] <mail2345> the turrets stunned me
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> Muscle is hardly a big loss
[9:45] <Dysgalt> and our out of rbreath
[9:45] <mail2345> and the captain had a quick look at me
[9:45] <vurtual_> Bomb_Spammer, okay
[9:45] <Dysgalt> lol your a idiot
[9:45] <mail2345> before i turned on stealth
[9:45] <vurtual_> losing the ability to use your better arm
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> OH GOD
[9:45] <vurtual_> will suuuck
[9:45] <mail2345> so i ran
[9:45] <Dysgalt> Muscles determine everthing
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> I CANT KEEP TRACK OF THE CONVERSATION
[9:45] <mail2345> back to medbay where i should be
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> Too many people talking all at once
[9:45] <mail2345> and then the captain annouinced
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> What the fuck is going on
[9:45] <Dysgalt> Learn to irc
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> Also
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> >your an idiot
[9:45] <mail2345> that there was a steal traitor
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> The irony
[9:45] <mail2345> and so some securitry guy
[9:45] <mail2345> caught me with his thermal goggles
[9:45] <Dysgalt> Bomb, hurting
[9:45] <mail2345> i ran
[9:45] <mail2345> got caught
[9:45] <Dysgalt> Quadratis lumboris
[9:45] <Dysgalt> CRIPPLES YOUR ENTIRE BODY
[9:45] <Bomb_Spammer> Also how the fuck is a .22 supposed to knock you back?
[9:46] <Bomb_Spammer> The thing is the size of a pea
[9:46] <mail2345> when they pushed me over to the brig
[9:46] <mail2345> i ran
[9:46] <Bomb_Spammer> Sure it's going fast but it has nowhere near enough force to kock you back
[9:46] <mail2345> the jainitor was mopping
[9:46] <vurtual_> Bomb_Spammer a small bullet hitting you will knock you back a tiiiiny bit
[9:46] <Dysgalt> Knock you back as in daze
[9:46] <mail2345> and THE SEUCRITY GUY SLIPPED
[9:46] <mail2345> i ran away
[9:46] <vurtual_> a tiiiny bit
[9:46] <Dysgalt> you stumble
[9:46] <Dysgalt> out of breath
[9:46] <Bomb_Spammer> Allt eh force would be distrcibuted in your squishy bits
[9:46] <mail2345> removed the handcuffs

[10:46] <vurtual> seriously
[10:46] <vurtual> my brother got a dreamcast then ignored it
[10:46] <vurtual> grab me some memory cards and we could play caution: seaman or something silly
[10:46] <Amiculi> Caution: Seaman? I think it was just Seaman
[10:46] <Amiculi> the caution tape was artistic depiction
[10:46] <Admiral|Splatticus> Fyi guys.
[10:47] <Amiculi> also, that game ruled
[10:47] <Admiral|Splatticus> Speed mining trees with dynamite = Not working.
[10:47] <Amiculi> he was one snide, inciteful little bastard
[10:47] <JabJabJab> Kirby Adventures 2
[10:47] <vurtual> the caution is the cool part
[10:47] <vurtual> it's part of the title
[10:47] <vurtual> also leonard nimoy
[10:47] <JabJabJab> someone should make a minecraft theme of kirby adventures

[10:54] <vurtual> it sounds like that
[10:55] <Tommerry11> cool

[10:55] <Amiculi> there was a PC version of Seaman that'd swim around on your desktop and comment on your computer doings
[10:55] <Amiculi> that got cancelled q.q
[10:56] <Amiculi> and I imagine you could use one of those concert T-shirt guns for a mountain dew canon
[10:56] <Amiculi> it'd just be far more likely to impart greivous injury
[10:57] <vurtual> they're designed with fins that flip out and give it a gentle glide
[10:57] <Amiculi> I would think that might make them more dangerous
[10:58] <vurtual> if it hit you
[10:58] <vurtual> you'd sorta feel like someone lightly pushed on yoru face
[10:58] <vurtual> then suddenly they lost all mass and fell down
[10:58] <vurtual> like someone's walking by and they push you in the face with their hand but then they just became nearly weightless and flopped slowly
[10:59] * Tommerry11 (chatzilla@121-200-6-163.cust.aussiebb.net) Quit (Quit: bye peoples.)
[10:59] <Amiculi> maybe mountain dew clusterbombing would be more effective
[10:59] <vurtual> anyways there aren't enough aspergers people for it to be dangerous, the nerds who can catch will just pass them around anyways.
[10:59] <vurtual> no wait
[10:59] <vurtual> the floor should have like, elevators
[10:59] <vurtual> and then people just have a mail tube system
[11:00] <AndrewPH> ofc
[11:00] <vurtual> so every time a dew request is wifi'd in to a spot/entered on a panel, the mountain dew is removed from storage by a robo arm, is placed into another claw that's wirelessly linked to rails and moves
[11:00] <mail2345> inb4mail whining

[11:02] <vurtual> a system of tarnsports for resources that move deep underground, capible of loading up any needs instantly onto sites based on demand, then dispensing them.
[11:02] <vurtual> During relief efforts, you just send in a massive tram thing full of needs and boom, onsite stuff.
[11:02] <Amiculi> ...
[11:03] <vurtual> That'd make a huge amount of jobs if you had it, just a massive subway system for everything you need.
[11:03] <Myselfe> and then terrorists blow it up

[11:45] <Parthon> doesn't mibbit provide a tunnel, not just a connection
[11:45] <TestDummy> Guestblablabla: Please don't, I insist.
[11:45] <Parthon> because it manages to hop firewalls and stuff
[11:45] <Guestblablabla> but i DONT have pidgin
[11:46] <TestDummy> Then you aren't the person that registered the account!
[11:46] <Guestblablabla> i am!

[11:48] <Guestblablabla> hmm
[11:48] <Guestblablabla> wait

[11:49] <AndrewPH> TestDummy, I suggest you kill him because he's trying to lie
[11:49] <TestDummy> I don't need to be told how to go about my work.
[11:49] <TestDummy> :(
[11:49] <Parthon> TestDummy: do nicknames expire?
[11:49] <TestDummy> Yes.
[11:49] <outsomnia|Clinton> 21 days is it?
[11:49] <Parthon> it could be that
[11:49] <TestDummy> Otherwise, we'd get stagnant registrations.
[11:49] <TestDummy> 30.
[11:50] <outsomnia|Clinton> Ah.
[11:50] <TestDummy> 14 or so for channels.
[11:50] <Marach> haha, now im happy of /ignoring *Guest*
[11:50] <TestDummy> Expiring nicknames keeps the pool of registrations somewhat fresh.
[11:51] <AndrewPH> TestDummy, is there a way you can set a nick to never expire?
[11:51] * atomsk (Mibbit@c-24-1-9-43.hsd1.in.comcast.net) has joined #minecraft
[11:51] <Parthon> TestDummy: interesting idea :P
[11:51] <TestDummy> I believe there's an option within Services to do such a thing.
[11:51] <AndrewPH> That's neat
[11:51] <TestDummy> But we don't offer it on request, or as something you can enable yourself.
[11:51] <Parthon> because the problems caused by expiring nicknames could far outweight those caused by not expiring
[11:51] <AndrewPH> ofc

[11:52] <TestDummy> We try to keep it fairly simple, identify at least once a month (or preferably whenever you connect) and your registration will stay active.
[11:52] <TestDummy> That applies to links too.
[11:52] <Marach> i don't see anything wrong with that
[11:53] <TestDummy> If you link to names but never use them, they'll be unlinked from your registration.
[11:53] <Marach> but links? >:(
[11:53] <Marach> links r cul
[11:53] <TestDummy> They're treated like registrations.
[11:53] <Guestblablabla> http://imgur.com/dhQlM.png
[11:53] <Guestblablabla> i registered from my school computer tough :S
[11:53] <TestDummy> Guestblablabla: That email is from March 4th.
[11:53] <TestDummy> Over a month and a half ago.
[11:53] <Marach> oh lol, i linked ^_^
[11:54] <TestDummy> Our registrations only last for one month, thirty days.
[11:54] <TestDummy> If you register an account, but never identify to it, we drop your registration.
[11:54] <TestDummy> Leaving it for others to register for themselves.
[11:54] <Guestblablabla> do i have to register again?
[11:54] <TestDummy> Not with that name you can't.
[11:54] * atomsk (Mibbit@c-24-1-9-43.hsd1.in.comcast.net) Quit (Quit: Client Exited)
[11:54] <Guestblablabla> WHAT? THATS SO UNFAIR :(
[11:54] <TestDummy> No, it isn't.
[11:55] <TestDummy> You let your registration lapse.
[11:55] <TestDummy> Too bad.
[11:55] <Guestblablabla> WHAT?!
[11:55] <Guestblablabla> LAPSE?!
[11:55] <TestDummy> You can keep on for YEARS, if you identify to it.
[11:55] <Guestblablabla> i did say auth *codehere*
[11:55] <TestDummy> I've been registered since 2004. You know why?
[11:55] <AndrewPH> You decided not to log on and identify.
[11:55] <TestDummy> You have to IDENTIFY when you connect.
[11:55] <Guestblablabla> i do ALL THE TIME
[11:56] <TestDummy> Not since April 4th from what I can tell.
[11:56] <Guestblablabla> everytime i come in

[11:56] <AndrewPH> >stop using > it doesn't do anything special to your text
[11:56] <TestDummy> Anyways, the reason the AUTH system exists is to prevent registrations by bots, mostly.
[11:56] <chibifs> Anyone wanna see my autistic fortress? :)
[11:57] <outsomnia|Clinton> \o/ yay autistic fortresses
[11:57] <TestDummy> You register, it sends you the AUTH code, you give us the code back and it marks your account's email as verified.
[11:57] <TestDummy> If you don't do this, we delete the registration after 24 hours.
[11:57] <Guestblablabla> i DIID AUTH
[11:57] <TestDummy> On March 4th.
[11:57] <TestDummy> It's the 18th of April.
[11:58] * Marach gets some soothing music
[11:58] <Guestblablabla> ok, imma register haxelnut then >.>
[11:58] <TestDummy> All auth does is "activate" the account.
[11:58] <Marach> btw, what's that argument about?
[11:58] <Marach> i dont see any point there
[11:58] * Guestblablabla is now known as haxelnut
[11:58] <Parthon> Guestblablabla is alka .. nickname expired and got stolen
[11:58] <TestDummy> Identify proves to us you are the person that knows the account's password, and lets us know you're still using the account.
[11:58] <Marach> and what's wrong with that.
[11:59] <haxelnut> i DID IDENTIFY ALL THE TIME
[11:59] <haxelnut> wait
[11:59] <TestDummy> This is stupid.
[11:59] <Marach> ^
[11:59] <haxelnut> when i identify, do i have to /msg NickServ PASSWORD?
[11:59] <chibifs> http://filesmelt.com/dl/groundscraper.mclevel here. :)
[11:59] <Parthon> yes
[11:59] <Marach> lol
[11:59] <TestDummy> /msg Nickserv IDENTIFY password

[11:59] <haxelnut> yes yes
[12:00] * Myselfe adb
[12:00] <Marach> ...what about taking that to #help
[12:00] <haxelnut> ID ID IT ALL THE effing TIEM
[12:00] <TestDummy> If you leave out "identify", Nickserv will think the command (not the argument to the command) is password.
[12:00] <TestDummy> Which will not work.

[12:00] <TestDummy> /msg Nickserv PASSWORD

[12:00] <TestDummy> Does not work.
[12:00] <TestDummy> /msg Nickserv IDENTIFY password
[12:00] <TestDummy> Does.
[12:00] <haxelnut> yes i know
[12:00] <haxelnut> i did that all the time
[12:00] <TestDummy> You make it sound like you don't.
[12:01] <TestDummy> Did you do it any time in April?

[12:02] <TestDummy> Your email confuses me.
[12:02] <haxelnut> and identify
[12:02] <haxelnut> what why?
[12:02] <TestDummy> You registered from a Charter account in Michigan.
[12:02] <TestDummy> But now you're in Estonia.
[12:02] <TestDummy> What gives?
[12:02] <haxelnut> ??? michigan wtf?
[12:02] <haxelnut> the email
[12:02] <haxelnut> oh
[12:03] <Parthon> TestDummy: is it possible that a hijacker could log into the account, drop the nickname, then reregister it?
[12:03] <haxelnut> i put wrong info everywhere where i register an account
[12:03] <TestDummy> Sure, if the password was something really simple that they could be figured out.
[12:03] <Yourself> Parthon, it'd be easier to just change the password
[12:03] <Marach> haxelnut: you cant put your location
[12:03] <Parthon> would there be logs for this?
[12:03] <TestDummy> haxelnut: No, that's just the host we recorded the registration coming from.
[12:03] <haxelnut> i can actually tell you my password... MICHIGAN?
[12:04] <TestDummy> This isn't making sense any mroe.
[12:04] <Parthon> Yourself: it would but then you could tell it would be stolen from the registered user address

[12:05] <Amiculi> It's low scale terrorism apparently.

[12:05] <Amiculi> Also known as Mild Annoyancism.
[12:06] <haxelnut> my point exactly
[12:06] <TestDummy> Parthon: Anyways, to answer your question.
[12:06] <Yourself> anyway, what's going on?
[12:06] <TestDummy> If you're worried about others possibly identifying to your account, you can set up an access list that only allows a matching mask to identify to the name.
[12:06] <Parthon> because whoever owns the nick now is sitting as an op in #hijacked .. that's just a bit suspicious
[12:07] <TestDummy> In the past, you could use this in tandem with the immidiate nick kill option, but we disabled 'immed' because nobody could set it up right without locking themselves out.
[12:07] <Parthon> TestDummy: yeah, I did that on my other irc network
[12:07] <Amiculi> lol
[12:07] <Marach> I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF HOW AWESOME IS GROOVESHARK. BLAH BLAH BLAH

[12:09] <TestDummy> Yourself: The trick to using 'immed' (at least, as we had it configured before) was that you needed to put yourself on the access list first, then enable the option.
[12:09] <Amiculi> lawl, okay, now I see waht happened
[12:09] * Vbitz (vbits0@122.58.184.135) has joined #minecraft
[12:10] <TestDummy> The problem is that enabling the option didn't bother to check the access list to see if your current connection matched anything on it.

[15:15] <Mithrildor> 1 day?
[15:15] <Peerko> it takes a few more for me
[15:16] <Mithrildor> Paypal expects its gonna take 3 more days till the money is transfered from my bank to my paypal
[15:16] <Marach> money sent on friday, received on saturday
[15:16] <Mithrildor> and then I still have to buy minecraft with that money which will probably take some more days
[15:16] <Marach> i was surprised
[15:16] <Marach> Mithrildor: THAT's instant
[15:16] <Mithrildor> ok :D
[15:17] <Mithrildor> 3 more days then
[15:17] <Peerko> not if you first transfer funds and then buy it
[15:17] <Marach> that's what paypal is for.
[15:17] <Mithrildor> Is infdev really that awesome?
[15:17] <Peerko> and that only works if you're verified, right?
[15:17] <Marach> if you've got the funds, you can pay for everything instantly
[15:17] <Marach> i didn't verify

[16:01] <Marach> rayman 3 is a great platformer... only Psychonauts is better.
[16:01] <Quatroking> I liked the rayman games before they went shitty
[16:01] <MPeti> seriously, what's the problem with localized versions? I don't care if a game is translated, but those who don't speak english well....
[16:01] <Quatroking> before they were actually about rayman
[16:01] <Quatroking> mpeti, localized versions have shit voices
[16:01] <Marach> i prefer games in english rather then my native language
[16:01] <Quatroking> what marach said
[16:01] <Ten_Tacles> Duh
[16:02] <Quatroking> brb
[16:02] <MPeti> I don't care at all, actually... both are perfect for me
[16:02] <Marach> the whole world should just speak english :D

[18:11] <thechris> why is elmo spelled so close to emo? is it because hes the color of blood?
[18:12] <CruelNoise> um. no.
[18:12] <Speljohan_> elmo predates emo
[18:12] <Speljohan_> by far
[18:12] <CruelNoise> i'm sure emo wasn't a popular term when elmo was created
[18:12] <Speljohan_> it didn't exist CruelNoise
[18:12] <CruelNoise> are you sure about that/
[18:12] <Speljohan_> emo came in like, late 80's
[18:12] <Speljohan_> and didnt become popular until like
[18:12] <Speljohan_> 2000
[18:12] <Speljohan_> or sumthin
[18:12] <CruelNoise> that doesn't mean it didn't exist
[18:13] <Speljohan_> emo derived from the music
[18:13] <Speljohan_> which came in the 80's
[18:13] <Speljohan_> and which sucked by the way
[18:13] <CruelNoise> i hate my parents for not telling me that it was the new mellenia.
[18:13] <thechris> but there was always rock, even in the 60s
[18:13] <Speljohan_> rock != emo
[18:13] <Speljohan_> different genres
[18:13] <thechris> ik
[18:13] <thechris> but i was just thinking of stuff from a while ago

[22:20] <MarkofBear> i really dont get that
[22:20] <MarkofBear> why would they do that anyway?
[22:20] <Koko|Minecraft> because they obviously don't care about other people's property?
[22:20] <MarkofBear> yeah
[22:20] <TerraSleet> tbh survival should be ported to multiplayer with the least changes possible

[22:21] <Koko|Minecraft> oh I'm pretty darn certain that problems will arrive that we will neeeever have thought of.
[22:21] <TheClassiestMedic> ty :D
[22:21] <TerraSleet> also, griefing is unavoidable
[22:21] <Koko|Minecraft> like someone managing to funnel creepers into your house or some shit
[22:21] <TerraSleet> that's what admins/ops are for
[22:21] <TheClassiestMedic> lol
[22:21] <TerraSleet> servers can have their own rules
[22:21] <Koko|Minecraft> open the door EIGHT HUNDRED CREEPERS
[22:21] <Koko|Minecraft> SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
[22:21] <TheClassiestMedic> XD
[22:21] <TerraSleet> e.g. no kill servers
[22:21] <TheClassiestMedic> Arson
[22:21] <TheClassiestMedic> Murder
[22:21] <MarkofBear> AND A BEAR
[22:21] <TerraSleet> or PvP survival

[22:21] <TerraSleet> where anything goes
[22:21] <MarkofBear> aping
[22:21] <MarkofBear> *raping
[22:21] <Koko|Minecraft> oh I want to be able to murder other people.
[22:22] <TheClassiestMedic> Yes
[22:22] <Koko|Minecraft> otherwise how will you stop griefers?
[22:22] <TheClassiestMedic> TNT under their ghouse
[22:22] <Koko|Minecraft> you have to murder them.

[22:22] <TheClassiestMedic> like OMG BURGLER *pew pew pew* arrows
[22:23] <Koko|Minecraft> but does the old trick from the test survival about disarming armed TNT still work?
[22:23] <MarkofBear> its not gay koko
[22:23] <Koko|Minecraft> if you tap it, and then tap it again, it disarms?
[22:23] <TerraSleet> would be hilarious is bow still had its rediculous fire rate with multiplayer in
[22:23] <TheClassiestMedic> Lol
[22:23] <TerraSleet> PEW PEW MACHINE ARROWS
[22:23] <Koko|Minecraft> hey I LOVE the bow's fire rate
[22:23] <Koko|Minecraft> it's unrealistic but it's fantastic
[22:23] <Koko|Minecraft> at the same time, maybe there should be a crossbow for that sort of thing.
[22:23] <TerraSleet> shame there's an invincibility timer
[22:23] <TerraSleet> booo
[22:23] <TerraSleet> crossbow? machine arrows? wut
[22:24] <MarkofBear> bears?
[22:24] <TerraSleet> if anything crossbows would have a longer fire rate
[22:24] <MarkofBear> and would shoot longer
[22:24] <Koko|Minecraft> and damage more
[22:24] <TerraSleet> yes
[22:24] <MarkofBear> and cook you food
[22:24] <TheCactusman> Have I disconnected?#
[22:24] <Koko|Minecraft> personally I think arrow headshots should kill mobs -.-
[22:24] <TheCactusman> Nope I haven't
[22:24] <MarkofBear> yes
[22:24] <TerraSleet> like the arrow equivalent of a sniper rifle :P
[22:24] <Ma|R|ACH|1> lol, aroow headshots.
[22:24] <Koko|Minecraft> does anyone agree with that?
[22:24] <MarkofBear> like deus ex
[22:24] <MarkofBear> 1shot head= pownage
[22:24] <TerraSleet> yes
[22:24] <Koko|Minecraft> I agree
[22:25] <TerraSleet> anyone without head armor = 1 hit kill arrows
[22:25] <Koko|Minecraft> let us tell this to Notch
[22:25] <Koko|Minecraft> yes
[22:25] <Koko|Minecraft> Head Armor would negate the 1-hit-kill
[22:25] <MarkofBear> maybe
[22:25] <TerraSleet> assassination hehee
[22:25] <MarkofBear> it could get broken?
[22:25] <TheClassiestMedic> >:D
[22:25] <TerraSleet> although that's also griefable
[22:25] <TheClassiestMedic> I will be an arsonist
[22:25] <MarkofBear> ooh that would be cool!
[22:25] <MarkofBear> a bounty on someone!!
[22:25] <Koko|Minecraft> well TerraSleet
[22:25] <TerraSleet> sit at spawn taking spotshots at the guys who just spawned
[22:25] <Koko|Minecraft> it doesn't have to apply to people
[22:25] <TheClassiestMedic> fewwhee
[22:25] <MarkofBear> wow... we ould have many assassins
[22:25] <TheClassiestMedic> wohohoho
[22:25] <TerraSleet> potshots*

[22:28] <MarkofBear> and a bear
[22:29] <Kokopure> oh hey
[22:29] <Kokopure> idea
[22:29] <Kokopure> you know how you can swing a ham like a sword
[22:29] <Kokopure> only it's pretty useless?
[22:29] <Kokopure> if you swing it at another player, could it heal them :D?
[22:29] * PyroLove (PyroPyro@93.86.86.49) has joined #minecraft
[22:29] <MarkofBear> good idea!
[22:29] <Kokopure> then you could basically have "medics"
[22:29] <MarkofBear> and what about
[22:30] <MarkofBear> laying it down?
[22:30] <Kokopure> who run around with their pockets full of ham
[22:30] <MarkofBear> to make traps/ attrackt wild animals

[22:30] <Kokopure> I do like that
[22:30] <MarkofBear> ty
[22:30] <ZomBuster> what would an undead skeleton do with ham
[22:30] <MarkofBear> nomnom
[22:30] <Kokopure> it would put it on its body
[22:30] <Kokopure> and pretend it was meaty
[22:30] <MarkofBear> indeed
[22:30] <TerraSleet> Posted
[22:30] <Kokopure> :D
[22:30] <Kokopure> yaaay
[22:30] <Kokopure> thanks TerraSleet
[22:31] <TerraSleet> http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=11917
[22:31] <Kokopure> maybe I should make an account and post the "heal when hit with ham" thing.
[22:31] <ZomBuster> would be fun in combat
[22:31] <ZomBuster> eat the ham to regain health or throw it to distract enemies
[22:31] <MarkofBear> what no creds for the bear?
[22:31] <MarkofBear> aaawh
[22:31] <MarkofBear> oi distract enemies was my idea!

[22:31] <Kokopure> TerraSleet why did you say it wouldn't affect Skellies and Zombies DX
[22:31] <Kokopure> that was exactly what I had in mind~
[22:31] <TerraSleet> cos they have no brain to implode :P
[22:31] <Kokopure> oh fine :|
[22:31] <MarkofBear> but
[22:32] <Kokopure> headshotting pigs will be fun at least.
[22:32] <MarkofBear> maybe they would use it
[22:32] <Drewseph> um
[22:32] <MarkofBear> for making them all meaty as someone said
[22:32] <Drewseph> Skeles and zombies are the only ones I'd want to 1 hit kill
[22:32] <Drewseph> well, spiders too
[22:32] * Gibri (eia234@157-157-78-216.static.simnet.is) has joined #minecraft
[22:32] <MarkofBear> and bears
[22:32] <Drewseph> but you can only really hit their head
[22:32] <Kokopure> awww yeah!
[22:32] <Kokopure> Spiders would TOTALLY be headshottable
[22:32] <Drewseph> but skelletons, thye are a MUST for a 1 hit KO
[22:32] <MarkofBear> true that
[22:32] <Kokopure> and they're the ones that give me trouble
[22:32] <Kokopure> ... also, lawl
[22:32] <Drewseph> since they can potentially 1 hit kill you
[22:32] <Kokopure> where's a Creeper's head
[22:33] <Kokopure> XD
[22:33] <MarkofBear> eeh...
[22:33] <MarkofBear> good idea
[22:33] <MarkofBear> maybe its inside one of the walls
[22:33] <MarkofBear> and dont want u to find it?
[22:33] <Drewseph> Spiders should be killable by jumping on them
[22:33] <MarkofBear> haha good one
[22:33] <Kokopure> this isn't Mario XD
[22:33] <Kokopure> but I like that idea
[22:33] <Drewseph> but dude
[22:33] <Kokopure> BONZAAAAI
[22:33] <MarkofBear> will there ever be a game
[22:33] <Drewseph> what the hell do you do to kill a spider on a floor
[22:33] <MarkofBear> for arachnophobia?
[22:33] <Drewseph> I step on them
[22:34] <Drewseph> also I think these spiders should be able to climb
[22:34] <MarkofBear> suishy little spiders
[22:34] <Drewseph> Oh and be smaller
[22:34] <Kokopure> I dunno
[22:34] <Kokopure> Drewseph
[22:34] <MarkofBear> *squishy
[22:34] <Kokopure> I think there should be different spiders
[22:34] <Kokopure> jumping, and crawling
[22:34] <Drewseph> I think there should eb big and small spiders
[22:34] <Kokopure> AND MAYBE FUNNELWEB
[22:34] <Kokopure> :O
[22:34] <MarkofBear> :O
[22:34] <Kokopure> that hide in caves
[22:34] <MarkofBear> good idea
[22:34] <Kokopure> you know??
[22:34] <MarkofBear> what?
[22:34] <Kokopure> when Notch finally makes Web Blocks that'll be a good use of them
[22:34] <Kokopure> don't you think?
[22:34] <MarkofBear> yah
[22:35] * PyroLove is now known as PyroPyro|OFF
[22:35] <Kokopure> I can just picture mining, and coming across a funnel den
[22:35] <Kokopure> and being like oh shi-
[22:35] <MarkofBear> and then game over
[22:35] <Kokopure> XD
[22:35] <MarkofBear> and then your house got looted by assassins in MP
[22:35] <Kokopure> I think they should be killable, but they should be, like, minibosses almost.
[22:35] <Misterangry> anyone ever seen Charlie99993?
[22:35] <MarkofBear> maybe they guard
[22:35] <MarkofBear> caves with diamonds?
[22:35] <Kokopure> ooh.
[22:35] <Kokopure> should they go after you do you think?
[22:35] <MarkofBear> territorial maybe

[22:36] <MarkofBear> well then youre raped man

[22:36] <Kokopure> unless you have, like, iron armor

[22:40] <MarkofBear> like spidey-rape?
[22:40] <Drewseph> its what happend
[22:40] <MarkofBear> why is that then?
[22:40] <Drewseph> then the following post has a hissy fit
[22:40] <ZomBuster> some people find it offensive

[22:41] <TerraSleet> Quarto, he probably put a size cap on the maps
[22:41] <rbos> Quatroking: probably arbitrarily; infdev has a limit, and he set it with a constant somewhere

[23:04] <MarkofBear> if you wish hard enough
[23:04] <Admiral|Splatticus> I find that.
[23:04] <Admiral|Splatticus> Using NBT Edit to mine with TNT isn't as fun as I thought it would be. :U

[23:07] <TerraSleet> stand back and watch the lag and profit
[23:07] <rbos> heh :)
[23:07] <Admiral|Splatticus> I did all that last night.
[23:07] <Admiral|Splatticus> So.
[23:08] <TerraSleet> i did that when Notch made you spawn with 64 tnt at infdev

[23:08] <TerraSleet> it should do a similar job
[23:08] <TerraSleet> or 2 stone gap
[23:08] <MarkofBear> the mans got a point
[23:09] <rbos> you can get away with a 4 stone gap if you clear out one block around the tnt
[23:09] <DimJim> where do i go to edit my minecraft skin stuffs

[23:20] <Quatroking> any way to keep these goddamn animals out of my base?

[23:20] <AndrewPH> HNNNNGGHGGNNGHG
[23:20] * Ma|R|ACH|1 hugs AndrewPH
[23:20] <Quatroking> Notch should make it so that pig and sheep only spawn on grass
[23:21] <rbos> it'd be nice if pigs couldn't spawn near torches, but could spawn above ground
[23:21] <rbos> BUT
[23:21] <Quatroking> so they won't spawn 20 tiles under the surface
[23:21] <rbos> they can't despawn near torches
[23:21] <rbos> that would let you make underground herds
[23:21] <Quatroking> Hey yeah, like in real life, let them be scared of fire
[23:22] <Kokopure> haha
[23:22] <Kokopure> that actually negates a strategy I have right now

[23:22] <Kokopure> then they die next to my door and I can grab all their drops :3
[23:22] <Quatroking> I have to go through my entire base every 5 minutes to clean out animals
[23:23] <Kokopure> but I agree, fear of fire would be good.
[23:23] <Kokopure> oh god animals
[23:23] <Kokopure> you saw my pig tunnel right

[23:23] <rbos> nah, spawn rate is *way* downtunecdx
[23:23] <Quatroking> also, at my base entrance these goddamn animals keep killing themselves by jumping so my entrance is filled with ham

[23:24] <Quatroking> lemme count how deep
